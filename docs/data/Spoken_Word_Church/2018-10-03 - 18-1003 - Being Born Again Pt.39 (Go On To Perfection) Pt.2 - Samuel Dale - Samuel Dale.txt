========================================

I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see I want to see you to see you I live - I need in the light of your glory for our true power in love as we see [Music] shining in the light of your glory amen to power in your loving and I want to MN and amen and amen I want to see him don't you remember now the announcements this coming Saturday is Bible study and as far as right now we found that for brother Vernon is as of now not going to be able to come and be with us so you know that's called off make try later I don't know I hadn't got to talk to brother Ernie yet to get to exact details but he's not coming right now so remember that part amen any other announcements we've been made if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to first Peter 1 and second Peter 1 yeah Bible study this coming Saturday 6 o'clock ok father we thank you for this day in your love father and thank you for your grace and understanding of each one of us thank you for you we just ask you that you would guide each one that you'd allow us to understand you Lord and to walk in your grace and forgive our sins and keep us Lord because that's the part that we need more than anything and just teach us that understanding because in that is where we Lord we're failing to walk in you as we see you unfold so just help us to settle ourselves down and get into that chance what we're supposed to as the Prophet said to where we can move on upward in you and just let your loving grace be with each one we love you and we thank you remember the sick ones among us just touch each one in Jesus name first Peter seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever how is the new birth brings it to Pais the birth of the word then what would be anything from there would be the growth our understanding our development into the word so now we go to 2nd Peter Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory in virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word in yeah I kind of want to you know I don't even in that one time and kind of injected a thought in to what we were talking about and that's kind of what I want to do tonight and kind of place it in the right order to where that we can follow the things because I enjoy seeing things from many different avenues in the Word of God I enjoy that I love to read and study it and that's what we've been doing see is taking like the statue of a perfect man going through that through the virtues and the things showing the growth development showing the the stages of our Christian journey and then we picked up adoption along the way and you know bringing that in to show that Peter and and Paul were both preaching the same thing that adoption is the same thing as the statute of a perfect man you know I remember a man one time say and he said always said that adoption is simple but said that statue of perfect man is deep well to me it's the same thing I mean it's a growth development of a Christian it's showing our journey in in through life and and do it and that's that's what I want to emphasize a little bit right here to start with no we're not trying to find something new or anything like that the Prophet didn't do those things but the channel and the way to come to the stature of a perfect man or adoption or anything like that it was lost down through the time now not lost to where that it went away that nobody didn't talk about it or or nothing like that it's it's kind of like the Prophet is we'll get to it in a minute where he says the the baptism in the Holy Ghost is so incorrectly taught well see then we must come back to his teachings of that and and and all of that way and that's way that I've always tried to bring it C is to bring what he had to say and bring to our under standing to you know follow the Word of God all right now it didn't when we talked about that the the kekkon worm worm locust caterpillar etc ate down the tree and the things like that the Prophet is not talking about that it ate the pages out of the Bible and we don't have that to where we can read or anything like that we still got the same from the time of bringing it we've got the same Bible you know in in our art laying out before us all right so it's not something to work that those things were eaten away that they could not be read but the understanding you know the the part of the word that we could follow it and have it revealed to us and know what it's saying all right see then when the Prophet came along to try to explain those things to us that's why it's made it so hard for us to follow you know our to to walk in in that word and follow it because it does sometimes sound a little contrary one to the other or our thoughts and ideas but remember now that we're studying the part of the Prophet coming to bring us the word that's the main point because that way where it's not what we think see we think it's this we think it's that it's been taught by mankind as we'll get to it in a minute that the Prophet says the baptism has been taught he said people teach it as water baptism meaning you're saved or they preach it as this is being saved or that is being said and he said those things are not right but that's been taught by mankind who you go across the land today to the church isn't a thing until you would find as I said there one time if we got you know I don't know how many thousand denominations they are now it used to be 969 well if you did you'd have 900 or 69 different verse you remember that back a few months ago trying to express something from it that we would have that many different versions of the new work well it can't be that confusing you know it can't be to that point you know somewhere there has to be truth and and we should have enough natural things you know to follow in the Word of God until we can actually see the spiritual from it now because of the opening of the word in the last days that's been brought to us all right so we're not trying to correct denominations and their teachings not trying to correct this that or the other it's us that needs the correction right it's us as what we call you know the endtime people we're the ones the Prophet brought the message to the message is not to do that you know it's not to the denominations it is if they'll accept it yes it is if they'd receive it but now they won't do it so it's not far that it's for the bride all right see then then you say well as far the bride and the church it is if they'll accept it but they're not going to accept it and you know that all right so it leaves it to word being to the bride within how many of the proud I've got some as I wrote down through here I wrote it like this what do you believe you know and I'll try to get some thoughts in there and just ask you what do you believe you say well I believe this I believe that well is that what the Prophet believed now if it's not we're not following the Prophet well well who can say who's what well we've got the books and the tapes at least we can we can stay somewhere in the ballpark you know the old saying goes would at least to have a few things and like I've always said you say after 50 years no what ideas all y'all to just a bunch of smart alecks well you ought to be pretty smart after for 50 years studying one message right I mean not studying all the denomination's and their ways and their ideas and if you're trying to do that that's that's not the Word of God it's to study the message we should have no problems with our understanding and it ought to be to the basis of laying down our thoughts and taking what he say it right but our problem is we want a little bit about what our thoughts and a little bit about his thoughts and a little bit about this a little bit about it and it gets all confusing because that would be where it would wind up all right we made as I said a little in road with the adoption Oh series into what we were talking about to give you two avenues of looking at the Bible as to what it's trying to bring the one Avenue would be from Peter see in first Peter that I keep reading that being born again you know showing that you need a new birth and then showing that you need a growth development are going to have it cause you're being born again then we go over to second Peter and we pick up how that is done by add to your faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience God all right see then we're following that through what we see in the world okay then we took the the point of adoption to understand adoption in the basis that you know in the natural adoptions of the land and the different things you got all kind of situations but Paul in Romans defines adoption Romans 8 and he brings us to the new birth his weight was bringing out the other day see he brought he Paul brings it to the new birth showing us that you know that we're adopted by the new birth see you and I were totally out of it we're not something in lineages all right now if you're going to go with adoption so you can only go to the Jews now you understand that I mean everybody our Eunice I see do I need to get the scripture the adoption pertaining to Israel Paul says why because they were to be the chosen people it had nothing to do for us because we were Gentiles all right so then that you could take the natural studying of the adoption and see how that they the baby was adopted you know when it was born into the family become a part of the family then it would growth development and up to the growth development to come out to to where it would have the the things of God are the things of the man and be adopted into the natural family all right and see but but that's Gentiles we had no connection so don't even try to put us with the Jews in adoptions means I bring it to what Paul is bringing it in Romans 8 where he's talking about you know the adoption all right and then we're by we cry by father okay then it comes on down to the second stage of adoption to the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God all right then it comes down to the life stage of adoption to wit to understand the redemption of the body all right so Peters saying the same as Paul and Paul is saying assignment Peter now in a few minutes we're going to pick up because I like it what it a Deuteronomy 17 16 worth it there's about three scriptures are that tells you you know that in the mouth of two or three witnesses that everything be established see you in the Old Testament times of doing the you know if he was up to a murder case that's where actually says in Deuteronomy if you were had something like trying somebody for murder it can't be by one witness it's got to be two or three witnesses see one witnesses this you say in the same things the other person saying you know arguing with each other all right let's see in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established well right we use the dot should we use the statue of a perfect man now we want to review just a little bit and then we want to pick up a third stage in the Bible of showing us the things that we need to know and what is the things we need to know see sure we need to know that we need to be born again we need to know that all right but we need to know adoption we need to know that we studied it all right then we need to know for sure 'ti how all of that will climax in the family of God that are brought into the position to where they're supposed to be you know all of us together in Christ all right and see then it would come out to show us who we are and what's taking place because that's the main thing the main thing is wonder what the prophets say when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for he said she'll be an invincible army right when she realizes that all right that's all I'm trying to do is get you and I to realize who we are and what's taking place all right see then taking things and showing it from the Bible that if we can show something in the mouth of two or three witnesses we ought to at least try to listen to that point to see that that's what God has tried to bring to all of us but now listen but Randall says on the blasphemous names they can pull that up if you want to but he says the Holy Spirit is not correctly taught no and he calls it holy spirit and the baptism he's tall but he said it's not correctly taught well no what is he meaning it's not correctly taught it's not truth it's partial truth it's our own thoughts and ideas coming in to that to try to tell what we believe well see it's not correctly taught see now he says that's so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit it's not correctly told I believe the baptism is taught this is just like an automobile you know you got so many parts sometimes all right and see each church has its own basis of the doctrine of the new birth all right now come into the message people what is it if you believe what I preach then they put the new birth on the basis of who who's who what camp are we in or what's going on you know brother so-and-so says it's this away cuz because he hunted and fished with the Prophet will amen amen for that I mean I would have loved to been able to done that but I wasn't able to but there's one thing about it I have the message that I can study and we asked brother Branham um we've done that over and over said brother Branham what is what is the new birth brother branham Christ the mystery of God revealed when he said he says the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's not to me to you it's not this that it's not from brother Branham to me and you now that gets chilly see because you say you're going wrong no it's not that away but a random could tell you what he believed the new birth was I draw the house that in anybody else now I'd rather have that than having my own because I had to get rid of mine to accept what he said now there's four the troubles that we haven't gotten rid of our thoughts we've gotten rid of it enough until we kind of hang with the message and say yeah but then when he said something we just go ballistic with his thinking and ending on we can't keep it straight but he said they're so missed out all right see then the truth is there he talked the truth but how do you think the people felt in the day that he was teaching it about one will in a minute where he talking about now we've we've went along with each other so far and he's preaching at the Branham tabernacle he said we went along so far but he said now I don't know from your own telling his own church what about it telling his own church and he said we have this we have it he said branham's Tabernacle this is what we need well he wasn't out bragging rest of them's wrong well you know all that out that Rumble we're right no he held it pretty straight didn't he but now listen he said that's the Holy Spirit had been so incorrectly taught all right now then what would be the you know how are we going to determine the truth well we just take what the prophets said well you know that's kind of in a day now when there's a whole lot of things falling apart that says this is what the prophets said and everything else right so then maybe we need to listen and think about and consider ourselves what do you think about the Word of God can it be so confusing what what has caused it to be that the Prophet would have to say that the baptism of the Holy Spirit has been incorrectly taught you know what happened it's been incorrectly told you know that enough you know I mean you say that's stupid brother Dale and we all know well that's gets the point across if he said it's been incorrectly taught it's been incorrectly tall now that that sensible doesn't need a revelation all right let's see we've been through some things that we covered through the message and he says it's not correctly taught I believe that the baptism is taught me and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with it all right now where are you going to find in the religious world a true understanding of the new birth there can only be one place and that's in this message right is that they're all right it's in this message so it's the message part that we're concerned about we're not concerned about everything else all right but what about when a prophet would make statements me and say things like this one we went through this we'll go ahead - number two - our brothers we're brother I'm talking about you must be born again now let's see if it has been so incorrectly talk what do you think about this statement I suppose maybe there's just a little different he's talking about it okay and I'm saying this I know it's going on tape and I want to say this to the pastor's that will perhaps receive this tape I suppose maybe just a little different from what the regular Church teaches it now what does he teach that the regular Church don't teach first off he teaches the truth that's all right but look look what he says I teach and believe and believe cancel approve by the scripture that you're born of the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit now do you believe that I'm as seriously asking you do you believe that that's what he said he believed when I anywheres else unless we get a personal Newton over what we'd say a point about him saying it you know unless we find something where he corrects things we're supposed to believe what he tells us now if he corrects it alright that's easy well I got a quote were okay let's hold on let's see if the quotes work let's see if it'll stay look and he's going to explain now why people have so many different thoughts and ideas about the new bird look at it and many of them teach he's telling you what he believed you're born of the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit and many of them teach that just to come up and recognize recognize before the congregation and so forth as a sinner that you want to accept Christ as personal Savior that that is the new birth that's what many believe many believe that water baptism is the new birth and some of them believe that that you're born to the water when you're baptized into the water and there are so many different versions of it lots of them many believe that to receive a recited Creed and believe on a doctrine of a church just accept say I believe in the Holy Church that's what man teaches of the new birth and like I said then you take if there is a thousand different denominations you've got a thousand different ways of seeing the new birth there's just a few different versions that he defines as to doing all right but he said I believe can prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body well do you believe that you know can you put your whole heart on that can you get up in front of somebody and say this is what I believe how about it would we be willing to do that go ahead at number three more people so tossed about I believe that you believe in to everlasting life I believe that that your acceptance of the Lord Jesus gives you everlasting eternal life when you believe it then I believe by one spirit then we're baptized in by one spirit you're baptized into the body of believers now do you believe that well see you can take that and make him say just about anything you want to but go ahead and think about it now now look he said Paul said passing through the upper coast of Ephesus finding certain disciples he said have you received the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit since you believe now do you get eternal life when you believe the people that the Paul talked to they were believing unto that did not possess eternal life right but they were believing on two did to have it right did they have eternal life in their soul wait ice is gonna go ahead but number four questions and answers on Hebrews but now as far as having eternal life and being a Christian you are a Christian the moment you believe well there's that Baptist I believe is that what you believe I believe what he says because listen to what he says and that's not make-believe so no matter what you're reading on this other one back up here where you say well you know you believe in to eat everlasting life see then it's not just a mental believing it's got to be something different why because now he's explaining that that's not make-believe that's truly believe on the Lord Jesus and accept him as your personal Savior you're born again right there and how we turn a lot God comes into you now we have the answer believing on two is a wonderful thing if you keep on believing it'll turn out to be what you're supposed to be wanting it to be so then what he's saying when he says that I can prove that your borned of the Spirit and then baptized into the body now I'm asking you the question which one is the new birth when you're born to the spirit is that the new birth well then what is that being then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit I've been through this over and over and over it for months and months trying to express it to you do we really believe the Prophet are we willing to lay down all of our thoughts and accept what he says well that sounds like the taste that you've got two different things dire but you see that's where we don't follow the Prophet go back to blasphemous names where we're given at a moment ago and look what he says he says you're birthed into this into this into this into this into this birthed into it how many new births do you have you only have one new birth but there's many as of trying to bring out the other day you have one filling of the Holy Spirit but there's many feelings of the Holy Spirit see so mankind had lost the channel were by the truth of understanding what the new birth is and how that it can be that you can receive eternal life by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ truly believing now not making believe in there have that you know haphazardly but you're believing unto eternal and that puts you into the body of Christ but then the stature of a perfect man baptizes you into the body for gifts and finally right see then how many new births do we have each one of these the Prophet says you're birthed into this you birthed into this birthed into this merchants of this birth is it what does he mean a birth means are coming forth into huh and since I said then there were many feelings in the Bible they received the Holy Ghost but didn't they gather together and they'd receive a refilling did that mean they didn't have the hope to go then they finally got to hold it oh no it's a refilling it's the growth development of journeys of Christian through to Jesus Christ into each one of us that you're being born again that's what Peter at UM by being born again well I got Holy Ghost when I when I now you're doing the same thing as I said while ago the Prophet said people do it so you say well I got the Holy Ghost when I come in this message well now are you doing that like the others were saying it it it's a baptism or that it's a this or is it that what is it when can you say that you really know you were born again because if you don't know when you were born again you can't know know nothing about a growth development but that's what's what was lost the new bird now listen to what I'm trying to explain come on as far as talking about being born again the new birth and the time that wasn't lost during the ages he's Church taught that during the ages even though Luther would come out to the preaching to just shall live by faith that was still talking about the new birth but what had been lost sure it was lost to what you're believing yes but what was really lost in the ages the statue of a perfect man the fact that we need these virtues because we think we've got it we're born again we got it and we got all these virtues we got it well see then that's Pross holding us here that's what's kept us here for 50 years that God is trying to get his word to us since they're going away of the profit to get us to settle down to what we believe and how the word is true but you see we know for a certainty that you have to be born again that was never lost it was not lost in the ages that you needed to be born again it was lost into the route or way or what do you want to say the way that is to take place was lost yeah because then churches come out of it saying this because you believe or it's because you shout arts because you cry arts because you're this because of that and none of that is the new birth there's no new purchase because you shouted or cried or whatever you got to make the new birth that's something that takes place then you get to shout and then you get to speaking in tongue then you get the things get the baby here first through the new birth let's see how do you believe because that's exactly what he's saying see what's he saying in the statement before when he said I can conclusively prove by the Bible that you are born again and then baptized into the body do you can't add it to her that you're adding a different stage to it the progressiveness of that of the holy ghost coming into you and I see then you can see that we're truly being born again we said what but brother Dale you just so confuses because you the way you talk well we read what a prophet had to say he said I can prove it do we believe it that way no I believe you're born again you know and and I don't know about these Oh we'll see what was eaten away was the statue of a perfect man the adoption the deeper teachings I've heard adoption taught in the Baptist Church come on church let's see we try to make it with our own thoughts and ideas or something and not realizing we're doing the same thing that mankind has always done we're taking our idea put it together with a prophet to try to make it come out of something that we can comprehend you don't need to comprehend the new birth you need to die to yourself and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior there ain't no comprehending comprehend and comes after you get the new birth right before the end you only got mental comprehending see that's why you can't lay it on that you can't lay it on to this say I got it when I believe are you for and me not make-believing but when you truly believe God country already treating prophet said God comes and lives in you and its own down below the wreck city makes you a new creature well I just don't understand how that you you you talk about that well have I said anything he didn't say did it I mean have we read what he's saying I didn't make the statement he's the one that said it I can prove I teach and believe and believe can sufficiently prove by the scriptures that you're born to the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit see this is back in 62 and he was teaching the statue of a perfect man so what are you being done as these virtues come forth we are being baptized into the body by the opening of God's Word it's being born again as Peter says why can't we see it that away instead well I've done had a new birth what I need anymore a certain person one time we're talking about sanctification they said I've been sanctified I don't need to hear none about no sanctification okay that's your problem ain't mine is your flag go all the way through the Bible them out through the seals and oh nothing and everything else through that all the way to the future home we believe it in sanctification because it don't stop see that's what I've tried to get you to see your new birth don't stop it's not just one lump sum blue see that's what we want it to be just one blue I got it I got it instead of a growth development and how would you have your children here under that form have to grow into that we have to grow into him is that a coordinate is Chris and what does he say but now as far as having eternal life and being a Christian you're a Christian the moment you believe well that's Baptist doctrine well then you argue him he I just read it is he teaching Baptist doctrine if he is why is he saying it's a little contrary to everybody else right maybe another message but that's what he said right why would you always people who was against him and what he was teaching because he teaching things they didn't understand right he turning off when you believe it then I believe by one spiritual baptized into the body of believers then they clarified it by what he's saying not make believe but truly believe on the Lord Jesus and accept him as your personal Savior you're born again right there and have eternal life God comes into you now is he teaching something that doesn't sound the way that we used to believe or is he so confused well I can show you later where he said this well okay you're in that category what the Prophet was missed it here in misses are and I found where he missed it well just glory hallelujah go on with your little pity patter but don't come around here pity pattern we talk plain don't don't come around here to try to bring ideas like something like come we got no room for it me see not make believe truly believe but spies from death unto life you're a new creature right then a new creature what about it then why is it so confusing to try to understand a simple thing of the new birth now listen it wouldn't be confusing if everybody believed the new birth is a birth of the word oh okay I'm putting it out here she ought to me if everybody believes it's the birth of the word what sure what's the problem what's the new birth birth of the word what's the new birth birth for the word what the Prophet said the new birth revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you what's the new birth birth of the word alright what's the statute of a perfect man built by the birth of the word do you understand what I'm saying there was never an age did not have the new birth faith that was not taken away like my wife always used to say it was not the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was taken away it was the word that the bug ate down and you can only work an amount of word that you have in the baptism when the Holy Ghost can only work in that point so what is that see what was taken away in the dark ages the teaching of the stature of a perfect man the teaching of perfection and what it takes to be perfected or perfect what was taken away not the new birth every age had the new birth but they did not have the way to attain to anything further than that new birth then we covered it the other day trying to get you to see it whites been doing it in the age isn't coming down see that pure unadulterated word Bertrand said lysed it till about two four trkage so you configure that and when you coming up to the fourth age that you're up in here who are Martin and Columba and then was that and they were teaching the stature of a perfect man they were teaching adoption brother Brown said that was nothing greater outside the Lord Jesus than st. Martin and that's his words may be paraphrasing higher but it's right see because those men had understanding of the truth of the growth development of Christianity he said it let's see who was it Martin that they had miracles and ever service I believe that's right one of those men that were talking about said they had miracles and ever service mm-hmm why because they were Christians and they wouldn't just little babies but they were teaching the babies how to become adults and that's what Peter was doing that's what Paul was doing trying to bring us to an understanding what does it get confusing I know I'm placing out two or three things in this message tonight that each one I'm demanding for you to think or to make up your mind to what you believe do you believe the new birth away the Prophet told you that he said I can prove and and declare it from the Word of God that you're born again and baptized the end of the body well that like that looks like two things it's not two things when you see what it is one of them brings you into the body the other one is a growth development a natural baby is born into the world they don't get born in morning born after then but it eats and grows so is it with a Christian all right we see what was lost with the statue of a perfect man because they knew nothing about that teaching oh that well we got all these things we got all these virtues inside go ahead to number six number five excuse me no we all we go to that one that would be fine three 299 he says then what does it go then genuine temperance genuine patient see you're moving right on up the line you're coming forth into what God wants so read in between all the different things now bring it on up to where we can go to the lysed and be you Darfur perfect what's that perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect now do we believe that we're perfect then why do we say when I'm perfect you ain't either God says we're perfect were denying what he says come on listen and look this is what I like he's coming up and bring it up into the virtues or not and look and says you got up here now before you're asked to do that what was that message what is right back before that be therefore perfect Matthew 5:48 it says well you can't be pretty he said oh yes you can he said cause godliness requires the fact that you'd be perfect right have we been through the message and you've got way up here now before you're asked to do that yesterday one has to be perfect before you're asked to understand what perfection really is you've got to grow through faith virtue knowledge temperance patience you begin to get into a positional understanding because we're going to read that one but then you go to godliness growing in grace and knowledge growing up to it then he expects you to understand what it is about perfect you don't wait till you come up there to be made perfect you wait to come up there to understand understand what God has done for you you see one church look what I've tried to tell you from the beginning that's why most people are not going to make it in the change of the body it's because they've never been taught that they need these virtues they're scared of the message of anything that you try to direct them into and I wasn't the one that wrote 327 Church age book that you don't like when me to quote where the Prophet says what this measure of Malachi 4 Luke 17 there to do two things turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Father and reveal the seven thunders which is a revelation obtained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back within efficient if those things are not preached our hearts can't be turned back so we're going to keep going and dying going by the grave see you take it wrong when I try to say things but look you got up here now before he asked you to do that all these things has to be added then when you get up here he asked you now to be perfect God in his sons and daughters of God well coming all the way up to godliness now he expects you to understand what godliness is right he expects us to understand that now you remember this one blasphemy is 9 go ahead number 6 277 paragraph and what did he say patience and don't don't you worry st. no court then count them for you I'm climbing up the ladder now look I've added virtue knowledge temperance now I gotta add patience I still ain't got to hold it goes remember that two or three weeks we're trying to go through that what is the Prophet saying I mean you read what he was to say what's he saying you ain't got all the Holy Ghost right that's what he's saying you ain't got all of it what's he saying you ain't got it no he done told you got the Holy Ghost in the new birth of faith he then told us what we got the new birth and how that it makes us perfect but we don't have the understanding of it because it's so hard for us to believe that we as human beings can be perfect well he puts it at godliness where it's required then we understand being perfect and how we are perfect I wish to goodness is you take my advice and do one thing that if you would listen our read Hebrews chapter five and six especially one verse five and six and read all the things the prophets said about some time go we're fixing to get onto that beam do you understand the new birth wasn't lost it was the growth development in Christianity of trying to come to the stature of a perfect man it was the teachings of Peter in them the teaching of Paul of adoption that was what was lost in the dark ages they everyone had the new birth you know it was the birth for that age come on read the message brother around and preach the whole message don't why the Holy Ghost of these age there was no age without the baptism in the old ago which was eternal life so what was lost the growth development of Christianity the teachings of growth development the teaching of what we have need of and look what he says he said you come up here to patience lift up here amid patient he said you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet that's called the doctor and in this message that we faced years ago to see through you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet well that's exactly right I never got down to reading all of the scripture I want to read in Peter but we're gonna get to it how about this scripture add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness verse eight says if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ if these virtues be in you but what about the next one what about verse nine but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins he that lacketh these things what about that being written to Christians now oh I was a Christian blind and cannot see a phone wrong he's it like at these things it's blind I ain't quoting I'm reading the Bible right see we're not through yet with a statue of a perfect man we just gettin started then got to that scripture we think about having these things no but when he says we don't have them we can wind up being blind but what if you got one of these things what if you got the new birth you're not blind that is just talking to Christians right you're not blind yeah but what what do you mean I mean just what the scripture says he that lacketh these things is blind if we don't have them we're blind and cannot see afar off I don't care how much you claim to believe the prophets message or what we haul in screen we're blind well what if we have one of these virtues called faith then it's not talking about it Oh glory the day I saw that I done some shouting of my own and I wrote it in my Bible if I have one of these things I don't lack them so I'm not blind thank you lord there is an ability to move on because I'm not blind see we blind our own selves all right now we've been through this on Ephesians forward let's go to number seven we've been through this about the statue of a perfect man and about the disciples and how what they were to be all right but now we're going to approach it just a little bit stronger because we're going to Ephesians 4 and 11 and he gave some apostles from prophets evangelists pastors teachers for the perfecting of the Saints now if you want me to read it I'll give it in a minute brother Ron said the fivefold ministry was for the perfecting of the science you say well he said well bring me what he said I want to see where brother Branham says that his that brother Branham was for the perfecting of the science I want to see that now I'm serious I'll come right back here and call your name and say you corrected me because I've studied the message I can't find it without this message of the fivefold ministry don't have anything to bring I'll preach that to you from day one we don't have a message fivefold ministry no helmet is to take this message and break it down to the people come on but look for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ what till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and curd about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head no the it brought the message of how for ministry supposed to break it down for us of course that's why most people don't believe in the five full minutes and I've told you I don't have no problem there's a lot of people call herself five whole minutes triangle listen to and I get sick of sometimes hearing some of the people y'all listen to and wonder where the world that you miss that hat ain't saying you can't listen nobody never taught nothing like that what you eat you spend your time listening to something like that no see I wonder what's going on all right but you see that ain't where I want to stop that we make grow up in him and all things but a number right first Peter two and one wherefore laying aside all malice and garland hypocrisy and envies and all beacon as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow there by we're all born babies in Christ and must grow up in him okay cool tonight second Peter 3 and 18 but growing Grayson and a knowledge of our Lord and say grow into we've got to have a growth development that's the statue of a perfect man but now listen now let's get to what we're going to get to I told you we had two things we brought we brought statue of perfect man from Peter we brought adoption from Paul now let's take the third one to anchor it into the doing and then you'll see that what I do a lot of times I tell you I just sometimes I lay these things aside and then I wait till the time to come so now in the mouth of two or three witnesses let's see if we can get another witness out of the Bible that mankind has never understood the Word of God he tries to make it say what he wants it to say he has it in his own concept fourth office in Dar ba he's had a thousand different denomination and he's had a thousand different ways of the new birth and there's ten thousand of them in this message okay waiter number nine Hebrews five of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your dull ax here any somewhat melchester day come on okay for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles which is the word Oracle's law Word of God and our becoming such as have need of milk and not of strong meat now what about somebody what about a situation where somebody has grown up a little to get past the milk but then they go back to the milk is that what it's saying for when the time you ought to be teachers you now need that one teach you again which be the first principles or Oracle's and are become such as how as have need of milk and not a strong lead what about somebody strong enough to think they're away from milk but then they have to go back to milk is that what Paul said no words Paul said going back to the very principles the word principle means beginning right now what was he say everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a baby but strong meat belong to them that are a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern discern both good and evil roll to the net therefore leaving the principles of the doctor Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God of the doctrines of baptisms and of laying on of hands and a resurrection of the Dead an eternal judgment and this we will do if God permit ours number three therefore leaving the principles what is the principles the beginning all right the beginning principles let us go on to perfection so now Paul is still right into the basis of where he brought out and Peter with godliness as to being perfection right did not Paul bring it out and Peter bring it out our perfection did not Peter talked about it didn't brother Brown the statue a perfect man talk about what you come all this way now and God expects you to be perfect we're up to godliness here's another example in the Word of God number three therefore leaving the principles now how do you leave principles in Christian terminology what is your problem when I asked you to read Hebrews 5 6 and 5 and 6 is 105 and 6 and see of the Hebrews series or listen to the tape you hear him explain what principles and things are now what is Paul saying therefore leaving the principles does that mean we do away with them does that mean that you did forget all of it and we just holler how perfect we are what does that mean how can you the principles and go on and many of you can ride a bicycle Oh mr. Mehta everybody in here at one time or other could ride a bicycle now how about doing me a favor when you get home forget about how to ride it and get on it and take off therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine Chrysler that's going to perfection well why don't you jump on the bicycle and tenhoff you know yourself that it depended upon that human brain that has been so set until it's a fact that it's not having to you don't have to think about pedal you don't have to think about moving you know how to talk about leaning you want to it's all mechanically involved within you as a human being that you never forget from the time you're five years old or learning to ride a bicycle and the time you get to be 80 years old you may get a little dot early but you can still ride it right now that's leaving the principles well what is leaving the principles principles means the beginnings I can give you the definition of the word is in what principles means and we're supposed to leave the principles how do you leave principles but yet keep those principles as the very foundation of what you're doing it's Paul saying all right now let's forget about all the Apostles is talk and let's go on to perfection is that what he say him no but what was for Paul facing you'll find brother branham explaining this if you'll read and listen you got every time for everything else won't you read and listen you'll find Paul saying you have made so much on this beginnings until you're not going on that's what it was a meaning when he said therefore leaving the principles have you stayed with the principles what's wrong with staying with the principle brother branham I got it laying here do you need them we're brother Brown and said we've got to stay with the principles what are the principles the beginnings what do you realize then and well so got it right in here laying we'll get to it a minute that Paul calls it carnal reform brother branham calls a carnal reform for us to stay with something and not move on you see what went wrong what was took away during their ages with the ability to come to perfection or to understand leaving the principles and run around and said Paul was speaking to the to the children of Israel when he was saying those things that they had got away from the principles I wanted to stay with the principles would put it anyway and not go on in perfection principles was all the Old Testament and what it spoke of when Paul stood dire talking about the principles to make us something to go into perfect he's talking about the whole entire Old Testament background to bring him to that place and he says now let's leave this from the wall leave it like getting away from it no see that's where the carnality of your mind will run it I didn't say that you can't stop your principles your principles are always there your beginnings cannot be done away with because if you've done away with your beginnings you'd have to go back to that that's what Paul's explaining see those Jews laid on those principles and Paul was saying all of those principles spoke of Jesus Christ and he's riding now listen he's writing to the Hebrews he's not writing to carnal Unruh generated Israelis now we just dropped a bomb didn't Paul is not talking to the is unconverted Israelis he's talking to the converted Hebrews and said why do you want to go back to that all of that spoke of Jesus Christ can't you see what he's saying he said look I come to church last week and said I heard all about Jesus now listen and don't go carnal on your mind listen to what I'm illustrating Paul said come to church last week and said how you preached was Jesus was God I'm quoting brother Branham out of there oh you're preaching that Jesus was God you preached in his name and this that and the other he said cut out all of that blown blown to perfection well what is for cooling the perfect we already got Jesus knowing all about Jesus knowing all about this no not about one God water baptism no eternal hell all of those principles now I'm going to state it so you can do what you want to go home the statue of a perfect man the faith of the father's we can dwell on that so much until all we're doing is making it principals there will not take us on to perfection the prophets message was not was not the faith of the father's he had to come and bring it to restore the faith but his message begun through the opening of the seals come on so what could brother Branham stand and say like he says here leaving the principles let us go on to perfection all right let's read coder number 17 Hebrews chapter 6 and last Sunday we taken leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ in the sixth chapter we read this let us go on to perfection and we found out that the people today in many churches along with the Branham tabernacle and different ones we lay to much own study about the principles of Christ he was the son of God a son of Abraham see that's what we studying he was the son of sonu and on back the genealogies but the Bible said let us lay aside those things and go on to perfection last side all the doctrines that he told that's not laying something down or throwing it down right because look at the rest of it first you must know the doctrine you can't lay something side that you don't know first you must know the doctrine then you must know all these things then lat then let's lay them aside I read Hebrews we're talking about even the resurrection of the Dead he said of the resurrection of the Dead laying on of the hands baptisms and all of those dead articles of God did we read it and yet they have no life in them come on I'm reading what he says but the church today just goes to those things oh we believe in the deity of Jesus of Christ yes we believe in water baptism yes you're laying on her hands Paul said we'll do all this if God permits but in the face of all that let's lay it aside and go on to perfection well I've asked you to read what he says you'll find him in our comfort and carnal reform as water baptism let's see if I can find it go to number 13 how many enjoyed the message on perfection that it's going to perfection that was our message this morning in the sixth chapter we're just getting into places to where we begin to get the real part oh we can all agree upon these things upon the deity of Christ and him being the son of God and how he was God and God was with him and he was in God know how we're going to agree excuse me he was in God and God in him so forth we all a grip on that but now from your own I don't know we're going to agree I didn't say this look just now from your own I don't know how we're going to agree or whatsoever it is he said I'm gonna give you a chance to write me a question from here own no question rate what are you saying are we to do away if therefore leaving the principles is that to do away with all those I know he said we've got to know the doctrine all right you got to know the doctrine you got to get that right but then because you know the doctrine don't mean you got it okay going down to the next 114 watch this let's get this word perfection do you know that there's only one way you'll stand in the presence of God that's perfect God cannot tolerate unholy things and you legalist how could you ever perfect yourself when you have not one thing to perfect yourself with you were born in sin your very conception was sin the very desire of your being was sin unless he goes on to the lives unless you're born again your loss legalist what's legalism what's carnal reform what's Reformation now come on that's where I say it let's see if you keep on agreeing now as brother running said let's see from now and if you agree what is carnal reform things that you think is what's making you right right you think it's what's making you right because you don't do or you do do come on what is carnal reformed things that we think is what's making us right how many of you sisters think you're right because you don't cut your hair when the prostitutes in my day would not cut their hair that's too blunt brother Dale but it was the truth you think you don't do this or you don't do that or you do this or do that carnal reform now listen he's ready to rent him a contrary to it he said let's get the doctrine right so what is the doctrine don't cut your heart after plain language that a revelation that's plain language don't worry your clothes taught women to wear that men could look at your letter no why are your splits that come up in the backs and everything don't worry off like that we believe in that we believe in living right we believe in being Christians right but let it be because Christ is living in us now it's not legalism its Christ living in you but until then it's a carnal reformed I didn't say it your prophet is talking about water baptism and it being right and there's no eternal hills and and the resurrection of the Dead Paul's talking about it but he calls it reform if that's that all we gonna do those are just a foundation those things that we've we've got our doctrines anchored we believe in one God water baptism no eternal hell serpent seed predestination we've got all of that ride why because we got the prophets words all right but now let's go on to perfection I don't believe is nobody can teach me and so I you'll stay in your carnal reform because that's what it is I don't need nobody to straighten me out your carnal reform stay in it that's fine you go ahead that's your business but therefore leaving the principles you understand what I'm getting at number one we covered a statue of perfect man we must have these virtues in us to be Christ in us a rapture for a bride a rapture for an individual etc depends upon these virtues Paul come forth in adoption and takes it all the way to wit and I love that so much until you don't understand how much I love the way he talks Paul's got it in his talking people read him I don't understand him Paul didn't say the change of the body because he couldn't do nothing but prophesy of it he could prophesy of the change the different things but he could not make it manifest so he was still hung on that so he said to wit the redemption of the body to understand these things he would take a prophet to come then for us to understand these things of the chains of the body and the things that was to take place and that was his message that begin through the opening of the seals and brought that message the others was a restoration back to the faith of the fathers bringing back to them then he stood on that and he looked at Paul and he said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on come on I'll give it to you there the other day read a spoken word an original see brother branham ladies message down preach this message God told him to pick up his Pinder out in other words he had his notes written for it he said pick up your pen and write he wrote and as he went through and he when he come down the end of what he say this is right this is right all this is right but as of yet Malacca 4 is not fulfilled so what was brother I'm saying therefore leaving the principles of all of this background that I've got here of the state of the spoken word original seed that he took in six hours to preach showing were that the Word of God had been made manifest again and he said in our day and coming he said it come through Mary come to this and is all the birth of the word and there I stood on that word and God said as of yet you ain't reached perfection God said leaving the principles now of all of these things that you've taught you brought us back brought the people back to the faith of the fathers and understanding said now go on through perfection what seals try some history future home who is this melchester the unveiling of God masterpiece I've asked you to do it I wonder how many people would ever went home and done what I've asked you a thousand times to do go home tonight if you don't have one we'll try to find you one take the book that lists all the tapes the index book get one of them turn over to 63 and start with the seals and read from their own to 65 just the titles of the messages there is not one title in all of those messages preached after the seals that would be anything outside of bringing and glorifying Jesus Christ except indictment you might be able to deal with indictment because of what he had to do it indict but read them Christ the mystery that's an eighth day message feast of the trumpets I don't care if brother so-and-so and you want me to call his name his brother so-and-so said brother Brian said it made sense ministry up to the tongues in a feast of the trumpet says you can't understand it brother branham in that message said it's dust saith the lord now who do you think I'm going to believe it's there therefore leaving the principles I got one more thought to inject and that's the headstone coming to the church and then we're gonna have to leave the principles because all I've talked for months and months has been principles principles because the faith of the fathers is principles when you're looking at the seals up ahead of you that's why I've always said I believed it from the first time I read it I believe it today those seven seals is a headstone to the church now you tell me something else that can be now the seven seals is the headstone to the church called in the seventh seals is marriage in divorce am i quoting him n is serpent seed two hundred about sixty eight by our fifty eight back over here everything it's revealed when he come into those seals and it opened to a brand-new field but what was that brand-new feel no longer dealing with principles rather random from the time he started his message and then come on do I need to quote wrote around them like rapture message not in the years of preparation not one of their says not in the years of the healing campaign but he said in the time of the opening it's time search we need to start thinking about leaving the principles we ought to have it already settled pretty good about one God water baptism no eternal hail serpent seed pre destinations and all the things now I'm going to say this part because this is where I always have stood man said it my house one day and he was talking about something and he said so-and-so and I said brother why don't you tell me something that pipes the future home I said you guys think it's your kind of take that brother branham just swept off the foundation and you got to build the building I said start building the building but start after the future home cause brother Branham preached this desire and he just rolled up in his seat and hushed because he knew it was the truth I said if you think you straight and brother Brown them out sweeping it off that would be one thing but when you start trying to say that you go beyond brother Branham and you're supposed to bring these things there's no such thing in the Word of God that's your to do something like that and if you think brother Dale thinks that the fivefold ministries to bring something contrary to the Prophet you need to get some principles human principles you need to get some beginnings to settle down and listen ain't talk for 250 years for that I've taught this message all of these years on the foundation and I stand today I'll be glad for you to listen to the tapes from 2002 up because we got them we had them all the way back to ever build ever tape in this building but we had to burn them cuz we didn't own the room for him check it out and see if I've changed my doctor I preach the same thing over a lot because there's one thing about it if you keep preaching something over finally people are gonna get the principles and then we can go on to perfection brother brands Macy's not beginning until 63 the other was a preparation the other was principals they had to get an order and right come on musicians he had to get all of that right the principals then when he got it all right then the seals broke right after the principals was right spoken words original seed read it as of yet man look how forwards don't fulfill he set out right then to find melikhaya for he went straight into the opening of the seven seals Curtis right on the end to the future home right taking us all the way to the future home we don't need anybody else to come along so you to do anything we've got the message but we need to stop with the star we need to not get off and lose the principles we need to let the principles be the things that holds us up because that's what it's far what's holding this building up is the foundation this is underneath it don't try to tear the foundation out you're gonna lose every time when he never talked nothing like that it doesn't come that away this message is the foundation with this messages of growth development throughout the statue of a perfect man and this message didn't come until after the seals broke the other was a restoration back to the faith of the fathers come on discuss that with me if you want to show me where that's wrong go see I'm gonna keep throwing it back to you say will brother run didn't understand this Brian didn't understand that but run didn't understand this but when the open of the seals came he said all was made right he knew right where he was standing right let's take what we got [Music] what about it therefore leaving the principles got number three now because three things that the new something lost down through the ages that mankind could not Salah and understand and he wound up to be the message of the disciples it wound up be in the faith of the fathers only can we go home when the baby the father till that we're still in carnal reform we're trying to convert each other we're trying to get the women to quit doing this and the man to quit and ain't it kind of funny you don't hear much about the men doing wrong it's always the women doing wrong my mother made a statement years ago what I had to agree with it she said a woman said she goes out and does one thing wrong since she's blackballed the rest of her life where's ante around her neck the old days now and said that's where it's been but said to let a man do anything he wants to commit and after doing that said he puts a town go to church he's called a brother and said mom you ride [Music] everybody miss message hollered and beaten about the women we men have the same thing so let's stop and get away from the principles let's get down to this being Christians not throwing it away not doing away Paul didn't say that he said therefore leaving the principles let us go on to perfection not laying again not having to go back over there come on that's what he said not laying again not going back over these times and over these things and over these things you see well you sure have done that a lot I sure I'll it's about time for us to leave the principles start marching on and see what God has for us it's in the word we like to worry about it it's dire somebody's gonna catch it and we'll be out of here Oh [Music] anybody ever need how great is his work he's the greatest one [Music] sister said said I have she's not gonna keep it in Jesus name we condemn this coffin it's all going away we love you Lord in Jesus let's go confessor you did have father we condemned these things we place the blood of our little sister you take away these old coffin things in Jesus anybody else just put your trust in you how great is our dog is his word he's the greatest [Music] my brother's gotta be traveling and being California for a week so let's just pray God will be with him all right father in the name of Jesus Christ we send these prayer close Lord for you to take care of her brother and we believe in we think here in Jesus anybody else [Music] for Hiro back [Music] too trusting you heard our sister trying to get everything set for somebody else working herself Lord you need to be with her give her the energy and the courage sometimes and the wisdom of what to do but also Lord take care of everything there and let it be sold all because in Jesus name anybody else and he said [Music] put your trust father we thank you for today and we pray that what we said Lord is enough to make us jog a little thought we got to go on to perfection not laying again not just keep over and over and over these things that we've been over all of these years that we've got them laid out in order Lord and we've got the prophets words and everything and we should understand it all and praise you for the new and now let us move on into the word that we can see you Lord walking among us and guide us now take care of everybody on the way home give a safe journey in Jesus name you're dismissed oh great how great is his work he's the greatest one
