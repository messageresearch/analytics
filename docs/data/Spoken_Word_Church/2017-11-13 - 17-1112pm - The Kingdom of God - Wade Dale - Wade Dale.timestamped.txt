[12:36] that were here yesterday for your
[12:38] support in the memorial service we had
[12:42] for June's mom we have a full house yes
[12:46] and I think y'all for coming but we had
[12:48] a full house we had 80 or so people here
[12:50] and we weren't expecting that meaning
[12:52] some but thank you the ones that the
[12:55] church here that came and gave your
[12:57] support and fixed food and put icing
[13:00] cups and all that other stuff so we sure
[13:03] to appreciate it but good to be good to
[13:07] have that done and and go on and just
[13:09] pray for the family and remember to
[13:13] brother boys class sister Monica's class
[13:15] and his class and Rachel's class stay in
[13:19] sanctuary after the service to practice
[13:21] the Christmas play / song everybody got
[13:25] that okay one more time Boyd's class is
[13:29] to moderate this class and his class in
[13:31] Rachel's class so that means every class
[13:34] except my class are the ones that's
[13:37] going to do and I'm gonna give you a
[13:39] little heads up we're going to since
[13:43] we're starting in next Sunday we'll be
[13:45] starting in the first seal trying to get
[13:48] this revelation five kind of sewn up so
[13:52] we can have a good foundation but
[13:54] brother
[13:55] Aaron's gonna take them up to December
[13:57] and he's going to teach our Sunday
[13:58] School class and then the month of
[14:01] January brother Bob would be doing it
[14:03] been letting them doing a couple of
[14:04] weeks at a time and I it's not that I'm
[14:06] letting them do it I think the Lord is
[14:08] is leading to do that and let brother
[14:11] Bob have the whole month of January so
[14:14] they can continue a thought it's really
[14:15] hard even when you're you know all of us
[14:19] that preach know that one service unless
[14:21] you're just a pure evangelist one
[14:23] service just can't do justice to to a
[14:25] teaching ministry you know it makes you
[14:28] really nervous and and makes you preach
[14:30] long so that I told brother Tim and him
[14:35] up there last weekend we had a real good
[14:36] time I want to thank everybody that that
[14:38] went supported that that that is just we
[14:44] spoke for an hour and 45 minutes but it
[14:45] really didn't seem like it and it really
[14:48] didn't seem like it to them either they
[14:49] really didn't care they weren't sleepy
[14:50] or running out the door they were
[14:52] running down the aisles but not running
[14:54] out the door so but we want to we want
[14:57] to give we want to give the full
[14:59] fivefold ministry a full length of time
[15:01] to two to do their to do their work so
[15:05] brother Aaron's going to do December
[15:07] brother Bob January
[15:09] Luise February brother Ryan March and
[15:14] probably brother Joe and he says he may
[15:17] not be here so I don't know what brother
[15:19] Joe was talking about but he you know we
[15:21] won't let him go home right yet but
[15:24] remember - brother Joe will be here wins
[15:26] then but dad and I are leaving right
[15:27] after this service we're gonna go
[15:29] hunting for about three days together
[15:30] down to South Georgia so just keep us in
[15:32] your prayers if the Lord blesses keep us
[15:34] safe and give us game for his honor and
[15:36] glory amen so now let's turn our Bibles
[15:38] to the revelations chapter five we're
[15:42] gonna speak a little bit today on the
[15:47] kingdom of God because I that covers a
[15:49] lot of space and a lot of territory but
[15:52] we're gonna try to bring it in and bring
[15:55] it all together from revelations 5 we've
[15:58] been into the throne we've been into the
[16:00] book we've looked at all these other
[16:02] characters but let's look at this we're
[16:04] gonna look at these seven horns and
[16:06] seven eyes because I believe that'll tie
[16:08] that in and it'll get your mindset to
[16:11] when we head toward the seals that we'll
[16:13] look at full Redemption because the
[16:15] seven horns and seven
[16:16] ize has to because seven is what seven
[16:19] is the number of completion something is
[16:22] completed when there's seven horns and
[16:24] seven eyes there so let's let's look the
[16:27] revelation is five verse one let's bow
[16:28] our hands
[16:29] Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you be
[16:31] with us said let's take care of us today
[16:33] Lord you be the one that does the
[16:36] speaking of them a revealing father or B
[16:39] you be the active participant in the
[16:41] service that we will give you all the
[16:44] praise and honor and glory for
[16:46] everything you've done so much in all of
[16:49] our lives we can stand here today and
[16:51] think of many things that you've done
[16:52] for us
[16:53] Lord we appreciate all those things what
[16:56] a great time of things given that we
[16:58] have coming up in the world but Lord
[17:01] what a great thing is given we should
[17:02] have in our heart every day of all the
[17:04] things that you've done for us father
[17:07] just forgive us of our sins Lord take
[17:08] care of each one that's not here bless
[17:11] the ones on the highways Lord just bless
[17:13] the missionaries give them proof of
[17:16] their labors Lord as they go even to
[17:18] this field here in the United States but
[17:20] also in the foreign field just bless the
[17:22] fivefold ministry Lawrence wherever they
[17:24] may be today that you'll touch them Lord
[17:26] and anoint them and sanctify them for
[17:29] the journey probably just be with us now
[17:31] and take care of us and the rest of this
[17:32] service in Jesus name we pray amen and I
[17:36] saw on the right hand of him and said on
[17:37] the throne a book written within and on
[17:39] the backside sealed with seven seals and
[17:41] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[17:43] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[17:45] book and to loose the seals thereof we
[17:48] were talking about who is worthy
[17:49] we found all that out so you should be
[17:51] able to keep that turn that around in
[17:53] your mind a little bit and no man in
[17:55] heaven nor in earth neither under the
[17:57] earth was able to open the book neither
[17:59] to look thereon and I wept much because
[18:02] no man was found worthy to open and to
[18:04] read the book neither to look thereon
[18:06] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[18:09] not behold the Lion of the tribe of
[18:10] Judah the root of David has prevailed to
[18:13] open the book and to loose the seven
[18:15] seals thereof and I'll be held in low in
[18:17] the midst of the throne this we're gonna
[18:19] take our tax phones verse six and lo in
[18:21] the midst of the throne and of the four
[18:22] beasts and in the midst of the elders to
[18:24] the lamb as it had been slain having
[18:26] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[18:28] seven spirits of God sent
[18:30] forth into all the earth you may be
[18:32] seated in the Lord I just blessing to
[18:34] the reading of the word looking forward
[18:38] to brother Jewell coming being with us
[18:40] Wednesday and give us a give us a little
[18:42] helicopter message you know and I told
[18:45] him up here brother towns I was like a
[18:46] big c-5a that was full of cargo and full
[18:49] of full of soldiers it took the whole
[18:54] runway to take off and it took the whole
[18:56] runway to land so but we all have our
[18:59] way of doing things right I'm gonna try
[19:03] not to I still my voice is still
[19:05] cracking a little bit so you just keep
[19:07] her you just pray for me that that the
[19:10] Lord will have his way now we're gonna
[19:12] start with number one because I want a
[19:14] background just a minute of what we were
[19:16] talking about last week or two weeks ago
[19:18] how can I overcome the prophet of God
[19:21] 1963 1963 did you notice the
[19:25] arrangements of that sea set with me in
[19:27] my throne because that's the last
[19:28] thought we had not on my throne in my
[19:31] throne that's in his domain now that's
[19:34] what we're told today we're talked about
[19:36] the kingdom of God because the kingdom
[19:37] of God covers a lot but I think we can
[19:40] cover it today and show where the Lord
[19:42] has give us a little bit of an insight
[19:45] into I was reading some quotes in the
[19:48] back where brother Branham was talking
[19:49] about you can't jesus said you can't in
[19:51] other words you without the Holy Ghost
[19:53] can enter the kingdom of God absolutely
[19:55] but you can even understand it okay you
[19:58] can't understand the workings and the
[19:59] things in the kingdom of God cuz there's
[20:01] a kingdom and a kingdom has to what have
[20:04] a king has to have a queen and it has to
[20:06] have subjects and it has to have a place
[20:08] you can't have a kingdom out in air no a
[20:12] kingdom is a domain is what we're
[20:14] talking about here it's a domain over
[20:16] something that what has been established
[20:19] now this king established a domain
[20:23] before the foundation of the world
[20:25] amen and then coming into that domain to
[20:28] see Redemption is that we fell from the
[20:32] rice of that now listen we didn't fall
[20:34] from our inheritance as far as that
[20:36] inheritance of eternal life before the
[20:38] foundation of the world we fell from the
[20:40] inheritance of what eternal life in
[20:42] these bodies
[20:43] into the in the world we're coming right
[20:45] back to this world we're coming right
[20:48] back here and we're gonna have a body
[20:51] that is glorified that doesn't hurt that
[20:55] doesn't that doesn't make one mistake
[21:00] that's what we're heading towards
[21:02] because remember that's what Adam was
[21:05] before the fall
[21:07] you said it out of make mistakes well he
[21:09] listened he was so much God till God
[21:12] didn't question what he done even when
[21:16] God went looking for Adam he was looking
[21:19] for Adam and Adam was hiding God wasn't
[21:22] hiding God didn't say no I can't talk no
[21:24] he went looking for him Adam was the one
[21:27] that had a change of what mind his
[21:29] carnal mind had what no his mind had
[21:32] been changed to carnality amen
[21:35] because remember they didn't know good
[21:37] and evil amen
[21:39] now then he said what did God tell him
[21:41] said who told you this who told you this
[21:45] he and the words God said I didn't tell
[21:47] you this this wasn't part of the kingdom
[21:50] that I'm trying to set up right here but
[21:52] he knew ins in his self glisten God knew
[21:55] all this was gonna happen
[21:56] and like brother Dale said and I have
[21:57] always agreed the way God did this is
[22:00] the very way he's going to be revealed
[22:03] or he would have written it or placed it
[22:06] in a different way this is it this is a
[22:09] perfect gun with a perfect word and the
[22:12] only way we're gonna get it is the way
[22:14] he has already give it to us and then
[22:17] there's no secret coming it's been made
[22:20] known the books open okay it's an open
[22:24] book don't sit with me in my throne not
[22:27] on my throne in my throne that's in his
[22:30] domain pull that cloak back up please
[22:32] and now as Christ is the ruler thrown
[22:35] ruler at this time of the complete
[22:38] domain of God look so will the church be
[22:41] with him the bride be with him in his
[22:45] throne in the entire domain not on my
[22:51] throne but in my throne see where his
[22:54] domain reaches a throw
[22:56] owners over a domain and a domain
[22:58] reaches just as far as this boundaries
[23:01] does I like that and watch what he says
[23:06] and this is from eternity to eternity
[23:09] hey man so this is this is we are what a
[23:13] privileged group of people that's what
[23:16] we were trying to get you know to the
[23:17] people last weekend what a what a
[23:19] positive people we should be had a
[23:22] preacher walk up to me and he said you
[23:23] know I heard your dad preached one
[23:24] sermon on positive attitude he said that
[23:26] I have been impacted by that sermon and
[23:29] that's been Lord brother Carlos come
[23:31] here probably six or eight years ago and
[23:32] was coming through and listened to you
[23:34] when you were preaching on a positive
[23:35] attitude he said to tell you that
[23:37] something I forgot so I'll tell you I'll
[23:39] give you a and I'll give you one of them
[23:41] that brother Joe said that what is it
[23:45] are we supposed to be sad listen this
[23:49] kingdom domain is from eternity to
[23:51] eternity not from what I listen to our
[23:56] domain and our inheritance like we were
[23:58] talking about yesterday IRA
[24:00] our earthly inheritance had a beginning
[24:03] and it's definitely gonna happen again
[24:05] we're not gonna carry money with us till
[24:09] the Millennium we're not gonna carry a
[24:11] car a nice car we're not going to carry
[24:14] nice clothes and and sorry we're not
[24:17] gonna have nice jewelry that's for him
[24:21] amen it's not the girl with the biggest
[24:26] stone it's the girl bride with the
[24:30] biggest revelation and then comes the
[24:32] stone is revelation amen it's good to
[24:37] have all these things obviously I enjoy
[24:42] life but we can't put our hope back on
[24:46] that and say well I'm getting this
[24:48] inheritance our inheritance remember I
[24:51] told you was before the foundation of
[24:53] the world listen it can't be touched
[24:57] Satan's dirty hands never got on that
[25:00] inheritance if you're born again today
[25:03] he cannot touch your soul but boy he can
[25:07] play with your mind
[25:09] and he can play with your memory reason
[25:12] conscious affection imagination and
[25:14] listen your body is just along for the
[25:16] ride
[25:20] you don't reason with your body your
[25:24] reason with your mind that's why I Eve
[25:25] the first thing Eve was in her mind and
[25:28] then what her body just reacted to what
[25:30] her inside told her to do now not the
[25:33] inside of the inside no not the inside
[25:37] that Satan could not get to Eve soul but
[25:41] he got to her what senses of memory
[25:45] reason conscious affection imagination
[25:47] Eve you see the animals God told you
[25:52] what to do what a preacher listen you
[25:56] can't touch Satan when he's preaching
[25:58] he's anointed he can bring it but
[26:01] brother Bram said a he's got one problem
[26:02] he can't bring it word for word he can't
[26:06] bring it word for word and then what I
[26:11] was trying to tell him up there in in
[26:13] North Carolina we've got a message
[26:15] though that came perfect word-for-word
[26:17] amen and it's not just the written pages
[26:20] of the prophets message look the
[26:24] Pharisees walked up to Jesus and they
[26:26] said we live Moses his law as I said
[26:32] yesterday the the rich young ruler as
[26:35] far as what was written on the page
[26:38] Jesus couldn't touch his life but when
[26:43] Jesus told him to sell everything he had
[26:46] oh he got into the census on that sell
[26:49] everything you have and come and follow
[26:51] me that's when what he turned away and
[26:54] he was in hell
[26:56] remember the rich young really went to
[26:59] hell so the riches is not all the
[27:04] outside but it's on the inside where
[27:07] does his domain reach the throne is over
[27:09] a domain and the domain reaches just as
[27:11] far as this boundaries does now look now
[27:14] look he said now watch what he says a
[27:16] domain reaches just as far as his
[27:17] boundaries does period he's talking
[27:20] about this there's no boundaries from
[27:22] eternity to turn
[27:23] that's why I brought that intercept look
[27:24] there's no there's no boundary this way
[27:27] there's no boundary this way it's all in
[27:29] eternity I was reading a quote back here
[27:32] just a few minutes ago when you become
[27:34] born again you have to the probably God
[27:37] said you have to have a different way of
[27:39] thinking
[27:40] it takes you in a supernatural realm
[27:44] that your natural person never has
[27:46] entered into that's why it was the new
[27:50] birth and that's why when we look at
[27:51] these seals and we look at the what
[27:53] God's put on the on the pages it's got
[27:56] to be the essence of what that says it's
[27:59] not the written letter jesus walks up
[28:02] one day and says eat my flesh and greet
[28:04] my blood and walks off but the Holy
[28:10] Ghost comes back and explains it that
[28:14] you're not to be a cannibal but if you
[28:16] took that very quote he said he said
[28:20] you're looking at the Son of man
[28:21] standing alert but he's in heaven now
[28:24] hold on a minute the Son of Man is the
[28:26] flesh guard hello really I mean you know
[28:29] you can say the Son of God well he can
[28:30] be in heaven but he said the Son of Man
[28:33] which is in earth and he's in heaven
[28:35] that's a supernatural understanding that
[28:38] only a few people would understand I
[28:40] don't believe those people standing
[28:42] around him it probably just threw their
[28:44] mind into a tizzy but by supernatural
[28:47] revelation a glorified body can be
[28:51] anywhere a glorified body can be
[28:55] anywhere right cuz remember he's got a
[28:58] body Jesus Christ has got a body hey man
[29:04] not just the body you and I are his body
[29:06] but he has a literal body amen we
[29:10] brought that out the other day and it's
[29:12] not laying on the throne it yeah we'll
[29:14] get into it maybe in just a few minutes
[29:16] but that is that man was a mediator he
[29:19] can't listen you don't walk into a
[29:21] courtroom and this is not even my nose
[29:24] yeah I'm gonna charge you for this one
[29:26] you know you walk into courtroom in and
[29:28] the lawyers asleep the judges are sweet
[29:32] and the jury's asleep
[29:36] but what are you gonna get done nothing
[29:38] know that mediator if you've got a real
[29:41] good lawyer he's gonna work and work and
[29:44] work and you know what he's gonna do
[29:45] he's gonna work that whole courtroom
[29:47] he's gonna work the judge and he's gonna
[29:49] work the jury well that's what Christ is
[29:51] he's a mediator
[29:53] he did his mediatorial work right now
[29:56] and down to the church ages he was
[29:59] working he's not just sitting on a
[30:02] throne watching he's working but that
[30:05] body is what it is put there as that
[30:09] what sacrifice that we can look like and
[30:12] see that sacrifice know that he took our
[30:17] sins know that he took our our stripes
[30:20] and and and all the things I was
[30:22] thinking the other day you know you we
[30:24] think of cancer and all these things
[30:25] that are that are really bad but but
[30:28] when Jesus Christ died on the cross the
[30:30] Bible says he took all that with him
[30:32] that's why that once the kingdom come to
[30:36] William Branham and any of you that's in
[30:39] the kingdom of God
[30:41] cancer can't stand before that doesn't
[30:46] matter if it's a man if it's brother
[30:48] branham are you and I put the same
[30:51] Kingdom we had the same Kingdom now sure
[30:55] he isn't he had a prophetic office that
[30:57] he worked through but you and I thought
[31:00] we were all prophetic I thought you and
[31:03] I were a little messiahs I thought you
[31:05] and I were and I think a lot of times it
[31:08] that people taking just say well you
[31:10] know brother Graham took it all back
[31:11] with him and and we don't we don't have
[31:13] anything he brought it so we could use
[31:18] it not brought it so he can take it back
[31:22] he brought it so we can use it that's
[31:25] what revelations 5 is to me revelations
[31:27] 5 look at the movement if you read the
[31:31] whole thing revelations 5 you keep
[31:33] reading it somebody's moving somebody's
[31:35] crying somebody's weeping somebody
[31:37] shouting somebody's reaching to get a
[31:38] book somebody's what doing mediator work
[31:41] it's a movement God is moving the
[31:45] kingdom of God is not a sanitary Kingdom
[31:49] it's moving all the time and even when
[31:51] we get to the Millennium even when we
[31:53] get to the future home we're not gonna
[31:55] just sit around we can if we won't do
[31:58] but we're gonna be moving but we're not
[32:02] gonna have to I got to sit and rest even
[32:06] in the Millennium
[32:07] the Bible says they'll build houses
[32:10] right no not the future home but in the
[32:14] Millennium build houses and inhabit
[32:17] there's gonna be people working so why
[32:21] are we not working now we need to work
[32:24] now right now let's go back revelations
[32:28] file to listen from eternity there's
[32:30] something there's a domain there's a
[32:32] kingdom of God which we know you said
[32:35] what brother way that's the baptism of
[32:36] the Holy Ghost now buddy that covers a
[32:37] lot all right
[32:40] revelations 5 verse 6 and I'll be held
[32:43] in low in the midst of the throne just
[32:45] go to the next pass the next quote okay
[32:47] in the midst of the net of the throne
[32:49] and of the four beasts now watch and in
[32:51] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[32:53] it had been slain having seven horns and
[32:55] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[32:58] of God sent forth into all the earth now
[33:00] listen you and I have a commission it's
[33:04] like I was telling you the other day you
[33:05] and I have an inheritance every church
[33:08] age had an inheritance he that overcome
[33:12] will I give he that overcometh I give
[33:14] and then our last one is it's two just
[33:17] what I was telling you that to me that
[33:18] last church they see it wraps up that
[33:20] whole domain because you got we're gonna
[33:23] look in a few minutes that in the first
[33:24] church at first two or three church ages
[33:26] you have the lion then you have the odds
[33:28] and you have the man then you have the
[33:30] eagle now brother Branham we know that
[33:32] we're in a prophetic age but the prophet
[33:35] of God said it was going to take all
[33:36] four combat beef to get us out of here
[33:39] and that is the Holy Ghost we're gonna
[33:42] need the lion we're gonna need the Ox a
[33:45] man an eagle him in that all right in
[33:48] this endtime that's why when the seals
[33:50] open it opened and brought eternity to
[33:54] earth it brought eternity to earth
[33:59] it brought a mindset that if we don't
[34:02] at this right we're gonna stay here and
[34:06] look we can't there's no other Church
[34:09] age there there's no other prophet to
[34:12] come there's no other overcoming except
[34:14] the one that we get when we overcome all
[34:16] things when we go to the future home you
[34:19] know that we have eight overcoming their
[34:21] seven in the church ages then there's
[34:23] one if you'll read in Revelations 22 he
[34:25] says he that overcometh will I give all
[34:27] things so that's it man all is all he
[34:30] gives you that whole Dominion he gives
[34:31] you everything you need that future home
[34:36] brothers and sisters that's all eight
[34:39] that's all in the eighth day that's all
[34:41] and that's why I've always said we got a
[34:44] piece of that now because if you're born
[34:45] again you're in that eighth day you're
[34:48] in that future home it's actually in you
[34:52] but what is it it's separated hello it's
[34:58] separated but when we all come together
[35:00] that cities gonna come down and we're
[35:02] gonna enter right into that city and
[35:04] it's not going to be a place where you
[35:06] know sometimes you walk into place and
[35:08] you go I like my mom I don't like that
[35:10] color I don't like that no it's gonna be
[35:13] made by what what what has built you
[35:16] what has built you the desire that you
[35:19] have that's what it's going to be built
[35:21] with why no hammers no nails right but
[35:29] it is you and I doing something here
[35:32] that's why revelations 5 we got to
[35:34] finish this up
[35:35] watch Revelations for now watch how many
[35:39] times it says missed now brother day
[35:42] let's cover this we'll cover it again
[35:43] miss miss alright now go to the
[35:47] revelations what's the next one
[35:50] revelation 4 and before the throne there
[35:54] was a sea of glass like in the crystal
[35:56] in the midst of the throne and round
[35:58] about the throne were four beasts full
[35:59] of eyes before and behind the first
[36:02] beast was like a line the second beast
[36:04] like a calf or not the third beast had a
[36:07] face as a man and the fourth beast was
[36:09] like a flying eagle now we're gonna
[36:11] cover every one of those in the seals
[36:12] because this the Holy Ghost that opens
[36:15] the seal then it's got to be
[36:16] holy ghost that does the work and then
[36:19] it's the Holy Ghost that does the work
[36:21] but look how many times it says in the
[36:23] mist now watch let's look at what the
[36:25] Greek says Lexington says about missed
[36:28] all these are the same meaning look at
[36:31] him
[36:31] among from among or amongst so it's not
[36:38] that slight brother Dale said it's not
[36:40] that he's standing in the middle church
[36:42] agent he's more know he's in the mist
[36:43] he's he to me out to me I look at that
[36:46] in Revelations one I look at Christ
[36:48] standing with his arms like this and
[36:50] he's touching the first agent he's
[36:52] touching the last age he's touching the
[36:56] first church agent he's touching and
[36:58] he's in the mister are amongst are from
[37:01] among he's in you he's in every person
[37:06] down to the church ages just as much as
[37:09] he's in you but that word was what was
[37:12] it there was a part that was taken that
[37:15] was given to Martin Luther let's adjust
[37:17] shall live by faith he fulfill what went
[37:21] on then you come to Luther I'm into
[37:24] Wesley then you come to Pentecost and
[37:26] then what we do is we look back that's
[37:30] one way we can look back we have to look
[37:32] back and get that because that has to
[37:35] come to us because he's living amongst
[37:38] his people he's living from among so
[37:42] anytime you see that word mist it's not
[37:44] that it's not that he's standing in the
[37:46] very middle and that's the only put no
[37:48] he's he's as much in this age as he is
[37:51] in the other ages it's just in this
[37:55] first three ages that lying then you got
[37:58] the ox in the fourth church age you got
[38:00] the man in the fifth and six will cover
[38:02] in the seal then you got the eagle in
[38:04] the seventh church age which is what now
[38:08] oh that was for brother branham no come
[38:12] on people that wasn't just for brother
[38:13] Branham that was what he come to breed
[38:15] us he come to bring you to us he come to
[38:23] bring us something that we just it was
[38:26] been laying in the Bible we were brother
[38:28] Tim and I were talking about Sunday
[38:31] brother branham never brought us a new
[38:35] Bible but he said the Bible became a new
[38:38] book what to him the Bible should be a
[38:42] new book to all of us in other words we
[38:46] didn't have to turn this Bible around
[38:47] and rewrite it to fit the prophets
[38:50] message now the prophet of God's message
[38:53] fits the Bible amen and then what do you
[38:57] do he took the one of the things that we
[38:59] were doing wrong and had wrong in
[39:02] doctrine and he turned us the right way
[39:05] amen we covered that already but right
[39:08] here in Revelations 5 we see the kingdom
[39:10] of God you say what is the kingdom of
[39:11] God the kingdom of God now to remember
[39:14] the kingdom of God is within side of you
[39:16] but that's not all the kingdom that's
[39:19] your part but you get all this in that
[39:22] kingdom of God you got the spoonful you
[39:25] got the ocean you got the spoonful you
[39:27] got the same elements in other words
[39:30] it's gonna take all of this line ops man
[39:33] and eagle it's gonna take all the
[39:35] fullness to get us out of here
[39:37] that's what revelation shows it shows
[39:39] that what that's gonna take every bit of
[39:41] that because remember this is what
[39:45] strikes me in Revelations 5 from the
[39:48] time John cries that no one is worthy
[39:51] until what the lamb comes which he's got
[39:55] seven horns and seven eyes right when he
[39:58] takes that book and the prophet of God
[40:01] tells us he turns and opens the book and
[40:03] reveals the seals right well then truly
[40:06] then redemption is over I'll read it to
[40:10] you I'm not gonna read it exactly like
[40:12] that but he's done his mediatory work
[40:15] but he's not going to stop until every
[40:19] person's name that's in that book has
[40:21] been brought into the kingdom amen
[40:25] that's what revelations 5 shows and then
[40:29] he's made us kings and priests and put
[40:31] us back on the earth so there's been a
[40:34] body change in there somewhere there's
[40:37] been what there's been an adoption
[40:41] there's been an adoption there's been us
[40:45] come to the placing of adoption then
[40:47] that we have come to the fullness
[40:49] there's been a resurrection there's been
[40:52] a body change there's been a rapture and
[40:54] we've been sitting in heavenly places
[40:57] and the Jews are getting their message
[41:01] because remember the elders ever and
[41:05] even the Old Testament everybody ever
[41:07] that's why say revelations Fathers the
[41:08] whole kingdom of God that's my brother
[41:10] man said that's the most sublime
[41:11] scripture in the Bible if Christ had nur
[41:14] took that book listen if he hadn't took
[41:18] that book you go right back to Hebrews
[41:20] 11 they without us cannot be made
[41:23] perfect and I told you when he reached
[41:28] and grabbed that book that meant that
[41:30] book was worthy that book had to come to
[41:33] a position because that book is the
[41:37] kingdom of God
[41:42] let's read number two the breach now
[41:48] notice there are seven horns on this
[41:50] lamb did you notice it having seven
[41:52] horns we just been through that horns
[41:55] means power to the animal y'all got it
[42:00] back tame horns means power to the
[42:07] animal and notice he was not an animal
[42:10] because he took the book out of the
[42:13] right hand of him that said upon the
[42:14] throne see and notice oh my I believe I
[42:17] had that wrote down somewhere to break
[42:18] the seals in to loose the title deed and
[42:20] the message to the last angel he takes
[42:23] his kingly place in other words what
[42:25] after the message of the last church age
[42:27] messenger this is where he's taking his
[42:30] kingly place then all right amen that's
[42:34] what he comes forth now to do now is
[42:37] this we know that's the scene but it's
[42:41] going to happen right here in me and you
[42:49] now watch when he comes out now when he
[42:53] saw this lamb John looking at it
[42:55] look like it had been slain bloody and
[42:57] he's come from eternity and he cease to
[43:03] be a mediator listen when everybody's
[43:07] saved and everybody's locked up in that
[43:09] book he's not a mediator anymore he has
[43:13] become a judge and not just become a
[43:16] judge himself but he has subjects that
[43:20] are in judgment with him and he's come
[43:25] from eternity and he seeks to be a
[43:26] mediator then pray to Mary as much as
[43:28] you want to he had must have some
[43:29] Catholics there there was no man in
[43:31] heaven an earth person being nowhere
[43:33] else could take it John even wept about
[43:36] it Oh Catholic friends can't you see it
[43:38] don't pray to some dead people person
[43:40] the lamb is the only mediator he was the
[43:44] one that came forth and what did he do
[43:47] he's been back here interceding until
[43:50] has his blood has atone for what every
[43:54] person that's why revelations 5
[43:57] completes the whole thing but remember
[44:00] you got to go back to revelation 6 to
[44:02] find out how 5 gets completed and then
[44:05] that's what we're going to get into us
[44:07] won't you see go back and read
[44:09] revelations 5 if you have a problem with
[44:11] the seals go back and look at this plan
[44:14] of redemption because the kingdom of God
[44:17] blank brings the plan of redemption into
[44:20] full view
[44:21] that's the fullness of God he's been
[44:26] back here interceding until his blood
[44:28] has atone for every person and the lamb
[44:31] now he knows what's written in the book
[44:35] so he knowed from the foundation of the
[44:38] world their names were in there so he
[44:41] has stood back here and done mediate
[44:43] mediator work like this until
[44:46] mediatorial work until everyone that's
[44:49] been put in the book has been redeemed
[44:51] and it's finished now he walks out so
[44:56] he's done his kinsmen work you know you
[44:58] know what the kinsmen work was watch
[45:01] this right here do you know what the
[45:02] kinsman work is to testify before elders
[45:06] what did Boaz Du Bois
[45:09] didn't what kick his shoe off in his
[45:11] house he had to go to a public place he
[45:16] had to take off his shoe and say I claim
[45:19] the rights to redeem my inheritance from
[45:25] the family whatever that family was a
[45:28] brother whatever would be had to be a
[45:30] kinsman the watch he's done his kinsmen
[45:35] work you know you know what the kinsmen
[45:38] work was to testify before elders you
[45:41] remember Boaz kicked off the shoe see
[45:43] after you and I to testify before man to
[45:49] testify before the world that God is
[45:52] still he's brought his kingdom to earth
[45:54] it's not a place we're going it's
[45:57] already been here it's been hidden in
[46:00] simplicity all the way down from the
[46:02] very day that Peter said repent and be
[46:04] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ all
[46:06] the way down to hear that alright you
[46:10] know what the kids when work was to
[46:11] testify before elders you remember boy I
[46:13] was kicking off his shoes and forth he's
[46:15] done all this now he comes to take his
[46:18] bride a man he comes now as king he's
[46:21] looking for his queen I wrote myself a
[46:24] note that's not looking for the bride
[46:26] anymore that's looking for his wife I
[46:30] told him up in North Carolina I married
[46:33] a bride but 38 years later I am married
[46:37] to my wife because she's come to a place
[46:41] and we've come to a place he's looking
[46:44] for its Queen in this book is the whole
[46:47] secret of it why do we have to look
[46:52] somewhere else the whole secret of it is
[46:55] wrapped up around seven seals what is
[46:58] the secret of the Queen because the
[47:02] Queen is the only thing but the earth is
[47:04] going to be redeemed because we redeem
[47:06] the earth is not coming to to any kind
[47:09] of a position until you and I come to a
[47:12] position come to a place where God can
[47:15] use us and then when he uses us we turn
[47:18] and we give it to the earth
[47:23] well that ought to make y'all sleeping
[47:31] in this book is the whole secret of it
[47:34] wrapped up around seven seals oh brother
[47:36] seven seals waiting for him to come now
[47:39] let's go to number three and reading the
[47:41] breech seven horns was the seven
[47:45] churches all right so there were seven
[47:47] horns and seven eyes remember horns
[47:50] means what powers all right
[47:53] horned means power all right what's the
[47:56] seven church age you see the seven
[47:59] church age is because that was the Lambs
[48:01] protection what he protected his right
[48:05] with on earth was a god-sent group of
[48:08] people that's protected see the Horn of
[48:14] the Lamb seven eyes are the seven
[48:15] messenger of the seven Church ages seven
[48:18] eyes or seven seers
[48:19] so God comes down through seven seers
[48:21] seven eyes and he brings the message to
[48:25] his church to his bride and then through
[48:31] the foolishness of preaching the
[48:33] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[48:34] evangelists we're supposed to dress the
[48:37] bride and make a life out of her and
[48:40] then dr. I for verse nine the hands of
[48:47] Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[48:49] this house his hands shall also finish
[48:52] it their brother Dale covered this the
[48:53] other day so you ought to remember and
[48:56] thou shalt know that the Lord of Hosts
[48:58] hath sent me unto you for who else
[49:02] despised the day of small things
[49:04] now when brother Branham reads this
[49:06] we'll see in a minute he says see their
[49:08] God in simplicity God in simplicity who
[49:11] has what despised the day of small
[49:14] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[49:16] see the plummet in the hand of
[49:18] Zerubbabel with those seven they are the
[49:21] eyes of the Lord which run to and fro
[49:24] through the whole earth which is your
[49:27] seven church days met that's why I told
[49:29] you before that's why that those seven
[49:32] churches had to be lined up
[49:34] they had to have the correct messenger
[49:36] and to get the correct messenger the
[49:38] Prophet goes back and looks at the
[49:40] pattern right right because he was
[49:43] leaning toward poly car code he was
[49:46] looking at Polycarp and the holy ghost
[49:47] said no he leaned a little too much
[49:49] toward denomination so Iranian says my
[49:52] man okay so but so we had to have that
[49:55] so we can know who Iranians was and the
[49:58] message that Iranians brought and the
[50:00] message that Paul brought and the
[50:02] message that who at Martin Martin one of
[50:04] the greatest teachers is one garden
[50:06] brother Brian said in the world well
[50:09] they needed that because what that was
[50:12] that lion lion li o and that was that
[50:15] one end of that lion age heading toward
[50:18] the on stage where they took the name of
[50:19] Jesus Christ and made him a second
[50:21] person of a Trinity all right God knows
[50:25] what he's doing they man now let's read
[50:29] number four I'm gonna be long we just
[50:32] got a few more quotes I want I just want
[50:33] to cover this one last thing before we
[50:37] start into the seals and just pray for
[50:39] us next Sunday maybe you'll be a little
[50:43] more happy about that listen we're
[50:45] heading toward a change of a body you're
[50:48] either gonna die and we're gonna put you
[50:50] in the ground or you're going to listen
[50:52] to what's being said like it was the
[50:54] first time you ever heard it or you can
[51:00] sleep home now let's turn to Zechariah
[51:04] 14 the property God said listen
[51:06] so--that's despised the day of small
[51:08] things God in simplicity see see he just
[51:11] preached guarding simplicity he would
[51:12] the Lord was taking him back to that for
[51:14] they shall rejoice and see the plummet
[51:17] I missed my place 30 oh right here see
[51:22] the plumbing and Hannah's ruble with
[51:23] those with those seven these are the
[51:25] eyes of the Lord which run to and fro
[51:27] through the whole earth
[51:28] don't tell me God took a vacation after
[51:30] the fall no he went right to work and I
[51:35] brother Nell said down to the old
[51:36] testament he couldn't enter into man but
[51:40] he sure could lead man he sure could
[51:43] give them salvation I was reading today
[51:47] did you read that
[51:48] when he put it up on the board he didn't
[51:50] say nothing about a prophet coming to
[51:52] Abraham
[51:53] it said abraham believed god abraham
[51:57] believed god each one of those believe
[51:59] god listen they didn't have a quote book
[52:02] they didn't even have a Bible oh sure
[52:05] they had the Torah but it wasn't given
[52:07] to everybody only the priests held it
[52:10] right how'd you like to be sitting in
[52:17] your living room one day just sitting
[52:18] there so much speaks and says get up
[52:21] Donnie faught blush and move take your
[52:25] family and go north Donnie's going weird
[52:33] the prophets say that is that in a song
[52:38] Abraham had nothing his home daddy was
[52:42] an idol maker he was sitting in the very
[52:46] throes of idolatry didn't know a thing
[52:50] about God he heard a voice that said get
[52:53] up and move and he just what got up and
[52:56] move but you know what God vindicated
[52:59] his move you got to be careful with that
[53:02] you can't somebody tell you get up move
[53:04] but God's gonna vindicate that move
[53:06] that's what's telling them in North
[53:07] Carolina you know there was a brother
[53:09] one time and most of you know who it is
[53:10] I'm gonna call his name but he was moved
[53:13] of God to take a job on Sunday so he
[53:16] could send all that he had everything he
[53:19] made on Sunday he would send to the
[53:21] missionary field and that was of God
[53:23] well it lasted a little wild and and he
[53:26] got worse spiritually than he ever was
[53:28] before that one God you told him that so
[53:32] you got to try those spirits to see if
[53:34] they're what see if they're in the word
[53:36] but remember Paul Abraham didn't have
[53:39] that didn't have a Bible to go back and
[53:42] check it by that's why you and I see
[53:45] Abraham could make those mistakes even
[53:47] David could make those mistakes but you
[53:49] and I can't make those mistakes you and
[53:52] I have everything we have an open book
[53:55] we have a library God sent a prophet we
[53:57] got 1100 sermons all these things that
[54:01] we got this knowledge what the Bible
[54:04] said knowledge would increase right but
[54:10] if it's not Holy Ghost knowledge it
[54:11] doesn't do you any good right how about
[54:14] a fisherman yeah God depended on the man
[54:18] that couldn't even read and write to
[54:20] bring the first message to save 3,000
[54:23] people
[54:24] Peter couldn't even write his name but
[54:28] you know what he said silver and gold
[54:31] have I none but such as I have he knew
[54:34] he had something he knew he got
[54:37] something on that day of Pentecost and
[54:39] what it stayed with him all the way
[54:42] through but remember see his powerful
[54:44] this Peter is God didn't choose him to
[54:47] be the spokesman of the church church
[54:49] age Paul was the Paul was the messenger
[54:52] to the first church age
[54:54] why because Paul took the Old Testament
[54:57] ray man Paul took that he did have
[55:00] something to go by he took the Old
[55:01] Testament and Roe 80% of the New
[55:05] Testament looking back through the Old
[55:07] Testament coming through the blood of
[55:08] Christ and taught Jesus Christ perfect
[55:12] enough to where God said that's my
[55:14] Eternal Word I'm gonna put it in the
[55:15] Bible Paul got it from the Old Testament
[55:19] amen
[55:21] so there is salvation in the Old
[55:22] Testament Paul proved that that all
[55:29] right the seven eyes eyes means seeing
[55:34] seeing means prophets seers this lamb
[55:39] had seven horns and on each horn had an
[55:41] i7 eyes what is it
[55:44] Christ and his bride now that's not
[55:46] Christ in the denomination that's not
[55:47] Christ in 144,000 that's not Christ in
[55:52] the Old Testament Saints that's Christ
[55:55] and his bride seven church ages out of
[56:00] there was seven prophets that went for
[56:03] seven seers so the last one must be a
[56:05] seer all right that all right say ma'am
[56:09] now let's look at number five here real
[56:11] quick we're not gonna be long
[56:13] I'm not stopping because we're gonna
[56:15] travel a couple hours down south but I
[56:17] didn't want I just wanted to bring this
[56:19] one piece before we start on the seals
[56:21] because look the seven horns and seven
[56:23] eyes are very important and like brother
[56:25] branham I didn't bring it I don't think
[56:26] but he says that's a funny-looking lamb
[56:30] when a lamb step four foots not a lamb
[56:33] it's a man but he's got seven horns and
[56:36] seven eyes on the end of the horn that
[56:39] by revelation though brother branham
[56:42] didn't see that because that would look
[56:43] kind of odd but he saw exactly what God
[56:46] wanted him to see John saw exactly what
[56:49] God wanted him to see and then look now
[56:53] watch the briefs the seals was broke
[56:55] while in the last church age to reveal
[56:58] these truths why he's asking the
[57:02] question why the lamb broke the seals
[57:05] and revealed them to his church in order
[57:10] to collect his subjects for his kingdom
[57:13] his bride oh my he wants to bring his
[57:18] subjects to him now I told you before
[57:20] what a what a patient god this waited
[57:24] for 2000 years
[57:25] God was excited he was so excited on the
[57:29] day of Pentecost till the excitement got
[57:31] into 120 they start shouting speaking in
[57:34] tongues and all these things and God has
[57:36] been shouting speaking in tongues all
[57:38] the way down to the seven churches and
[57:40] then why he wants to see his bride the
[57:43] way he's always he had this thing fixed
[57:46] before the foundation of the world and
[57:48] he knew that we were gonna fall he knew
[57:51] that all these things is gonna happen
[57:53] but he knew that he would bring it back
[57:57] to that place that he saw and that he
[58:00] could what hug him again hug him again
[58:03] bring him right back into fellowship not
[58:07] in heaven not in heaven people it's
[58:10] right here on the earth this has got to
[58:14] become a reality look at all the
[58:18] denominations all when this comes oh and
[58:21] look at half the people in the message
[58:22] oh when California sing oh when this
[58:25] great mighty man raises
[58:27] we have signs and wonders and healings
[58:28] at all when this happened listen we need
[58:34] to be aware of what was watching what is
[58:36] and what is to come but how many times
[58:38] did brother bran tell us that we miss
[58:40] what is happening now looking for some
[58:45] great something to come he told the
[58:50] Pentecostals he stood up in front of the
[58:52] whole nation of Pentecost and he said
[58:55] you're looking for something that's
[58:57] already happened and they're going he
[59:00] doesn't have yeah really that's what
[59:04] they did to let him believe him and you
[59:07] know what
[59:08] not believing him didn't make it right
[59:11] for them right the seals was broke why
[59:16] in the last Church age 2 revealed these
[59:19] things why the lamb broke the seals and
[59:21] revealed into his church in order to
[59:24] collect his subjects for his kingdom his
[59:27] bride see oh my he wants to bring his
[59:30] subjects to him now what is it out of
[59:33] the dust of the earth out of the bottom
[59:36] of the sea out of the pits out of
[59:38] everywhere in every place out of the
[59:41] regions of the dark look out of paradise
[59:44] wherever they may be he will call and
[59:47] they will answer he said a man twice he
[59:52] will call and they'll answer he come to
[59:54] get his subjects he revealed its secrets
[59:56] and they saw it there's the key they saw
[1:00:00] it if you don't see it you don't know
[1:00:05] what's happening that's what the
[1:00:06] Pentecostal said all day right brother
[1:00:09] Branham what do you mean what we're
[1:00:11] looking for this great something to come
[1:00:12] crying for a prophet wrote it in all
[1:00:14] their papers God sent us a prophet God
[1:00:17] sent us the Prophet he walked among them
[1:00:19] for years but remember he was vindicated
[1:00:24] and being vindicated it didn't matter
[1:00:27] what the impending officer said he was
[1:00:31] the man of the time whether they liked
[1:00:34] it or not same way with us you and I
[1:00:36] we've got to answer the call of today
[1:00:40] not the call of yesterday and not the
[1:00:42] caller tomorrow we got to answer the
[1:00:44] call today the call of today is is like
[1:00:47] I told you before we got to have that
[1:00:49] voice of a resurrection in our heart
[1:00:52] that those dead Saints can't stay in
[1:00:57] that other dimension anymore they got to
[1:00:59] come here I saw a lot of people
[1:01:03] yesterday of course a lot of them
[1:01:04] weren't weren't Christians someone
[1:01:06] hadn't darkened the door of a church
[1:01:08] probably ever right but they were
[1:01:12] looking downstairs nobody a there was a
[1:01:13] lot of them looking at those pictures of
[1:01:16] all the young the people that had passed
[1:01:19] on and I saw him kept looking and kept
[1:01:21] looking and they were looking at him you
[1:01:23] know so when I got up here I kind of
[1:01:24] told him that you know it's talking
[1:01:27] about June's mom she's 83 years old if
[1:01:29] she was a Christian that's her that's
[1:01:31] her business she professed Christianity
[1:01:33] that's all I got to say she professed
[1:01:35] Christianity in him she did then she's
[1:01:37] not gonna walk back in here at 83 years
[1:01:39] old any kind of some of them it kind of
[1:01:41] startled him I said look downstairs all
[1:01:43] those people were old when they died but
[1:01:45] you see young pictures down there don't
[1:01:47] you you don't say old picture that's the
[1:01:49] way we'll say them that's what that
[1:01:51] power that's what that power that's in
[1:01:54] us now he revealed his secrets
[1:02:05] and they saw it and time is no more at
[1:02:08] that time time has run out it's finished
[1:02:12] listen when you sin and come to it it's
[1:02:15] finished for you and I our problem is is
[1:02:20] we still want to make something happen
[1:02:24] well just lady just read the word let it
[1:02:30] happen a man said okay because when he
[1:02:38] said look when it says time has run out
[1:02:40] it's finished folks that's our body
[1:02:43] change when our body is changed in this
[1:02:46] time element time will be no longer for
[1:02:50] us
[1:02:51] time is really no longer for you and
[1:02:53] your soul
[1:02:54] it never is listen that Genesis 1:26 man
[1:02:58] is not one second older we talk about
[1:03:00] God we talk about guarding up being one
[1:03:03] second older what's then women when he
[1:03:05] spoke let there be like that Genesis
[1:03:07] 1:26 man is not a second older than when
[1:03:10] God said let us create man in our image
[1:03:14] it's got to be as eternal as God alright
[1:03:22] so these seven horns and seven eyes
[1:03:25] there are seven Church ages and they're
[1:03:28] seven seers se ers that come through
[1:03:31] those seven churches and they all wrap
[1:03:34] up in Revelations five when he takes
[1:03:37] that book now when he takes that book
[1:03:39] what he's got to do though is he's got
[1:03:41] to break it to this end time people I
[1:03:44] read to that a little while ago he's got
[1:03:46] to break it to us he's got to break the
[1:03:50] seals to us they were not broken Paul
[1:03:52] was a to the degree that we get it they
[1:03:55] get a portion because Jesus preached six
[1:03:58] seals back in Matthew Jesus preached six
[1:04:01] ales 2,000 years ago so brother Branham
[1:04:03] then is not bringing something that's
[1:04:05] brand-new he's revealing what had been
[1:04:09] what man had hid man had put the hand
[1:04:13] over the eyes of the people listen God
[1:04:18] would never put his hand over your eyes
[1:04:20] I thought open the eyes of my heart Lord
[1:04:25] it'd be real hard to say Lord closed my
[1:04:28] eyes no open my eyes open my
[1:04:34] understanding to what you got and that's
[1:04:37] what's gonna happen with leave when we
[1:04:39] go into these seals I want you to we're
[1:04:41] gonna read this one quote and then we'll
[1:04:42] be finished but keep this in your mind
[1:04:44] that God is doing the work it's not a
[1:04:50] man it's God doing the work God is going
[1:04:53] to take these seals and he's going to
[1:04:57] help us understand them more we have an
[1:05:00] understanding of the seals everybody
[1:05:02] everybody knows now that white horse
[1:05:03] rider it's
[1:05:04] holy ghost its Antichrist but that's the
[1:05:07] seal that sealed something that we can't
[1:05:11] see you put a seal on something what
[1:05:15] does that do you put a seal on it you
[1:05:18] can't say but when that seals tore back
[1:05:20] you can see everything in it look you
[1:05:22] can't see what's in the box cars to seal
[1:05:24] still on it and that does you no good
[1:05:29] the seal is what your sealed until the
[1:05:33] day of your redemption full redemption
[1:05:37] what's in that mom's car that's what's
[1:05:41] going to redeem you the seal is not
[1:05:42] going to redeem you the seal is what
[1:05:46] when you when it's broke I was thinking
[1:05:51] about this other day you know a long
[1:05:53] time ago we'd have a lot of things
[1:05:55] sealed up ketchup and mustard and why
[1:06:00] because somebody started tampering with
[1:06:02] it remember the tylenol scare in the 80s
[1:06:05] were somebody put some tainted stuff and
[1:06:07] he killed a bunch of people why there
[1:06:09] was no seal our protection I hope you
[1:06:12] get this there's no seal or protection
[1:06:15] on the product it was just open for
[1:06:18] anybody but once you sealed it up it was
[1:06:23] protected but I didn't tylenol didn't
[1:06:26] quit making town at all they just sealed
[1:06:29] it up so only a certain group of people
[1:06:32] can get it and that's you and I the mass
[1:06:36] of the new you know good you can take
[1:06:38] what man I got a good seal on this on
[1:06:40] this tylenol but boy my head's you're
[1:06:42] hurt what you got to do take the seal
[1:06:47] off and see what and get don't just see
[1:06:51] what's inside get what's inside hey man
[1:07:01] God seals your soul
[1:07:03] where Satan can't touch it and man he
[1:07:07] steals your soul so Satan can't touch it
[1:07:10] so the only person that can touch your
[1:07:12] soul if it's sealed is God himself God
[1:07:15] Almighty Himself the only one that can
[1:07:17] take your soul cuz remember he's the
[1:07:18] only one that can make it live and he's
[1:07:20] the only one who can make it die because
[1:07:22] he created he said don't worry about the
[1:07:23] guy that makes the body
[1:07:24] he said you worry about that guy that
[1:07:26] can what kill that salt hey man so if
[1:07:32] he's already done his work and put a
[1:07:35] seal which is the Holy Ghost seal then
[1:07:38] everything that's behind there when we
[1:07:40] pull that seal off there's all the
[1:07:42] vitamins there's all the product that we
[1:07:45] can use and same can't tamper with it
[1:07:48] because remember it's not for everybody
[1:07:50] that was the problem in the first place
[1:07:52] tylenol said well this is for everybody
[1:07:54] we're just going to put a cap on it
[1:07:56] well what Satan slips in and stick some
[1:07:59] poison definitely in it put some poison
[1:08:01] down in it and what he he makes it look
[1:08:05] like it's seal comes remember he's what
[1:08:07] he's a he is not an originator he's a
[1:08:10] pervert ER the tylenol was good until
[1:08:15] Satan got involved and he put a little
[1:08:17] bit of poison in it
[1:08:18] but when God sealed that thing up he
[1:08:23] said it's sealed and now only a certain
[1:08:27] group of people remember they put a
[1:08:31] childproof cap on those things
[1:08:36] well it's adult fruit for some I'm
[1:08:40] making a point here
[1:08:41] they put this they put the childproof
[1:08:44] cap on so what children can't get in it
[1:08:48] but supposedly an adult can open it a
[1:08:54] wife can open it
[1:08:57] that Alright a wife can open it okay
[1:09:06] let's go to number six now what let's
[1:09:08] let's go to the first seal and we're
[1:09:10] gonna read this and I want you to think
[1:09:13] about it but take that to heart God said
[1:09:17] if God seals something it was free
[1:09:20] you you you not the devil not the world
[1:09:24] when he sealed it up he said only a
[1:09:27] certain group of people is gonna get
[1:09:29] this but all when they get it you got a
[1:09:35] big headache Tyler I was good one of the
[1:09:40] beasts says come and see that's his
[1:09:42] first seal will close right here he
[1:09:45] heard the noise of a thunder and one of
[1:09:48] the beasts said now come and see in
[1:09:50] other words here stands the Lamb and
[1:09:53] John standing out there watching it
[1:09:55] happen and the lamb comes up from the
[1:09:58] throne like he'd been slain blood all
[1:10:00] over him and he was the one that was
[1:10:02] found worthy and when he reached over
[1:10:04] and took the book then everything began
[1:10:07] shouting screaming and carrying on
[1:10:09] because they knew redemption was paid
[1:10:12] for now let me interject something John
[1:10:19] was already sealed in his soul when he
[1:10:22] was seeing this thing happen so he
[1:10:26] wasn't worried about his soul he was
[1:10:29] worried about me and you get him out of
[1:10:31] the ground right that's what he was
[1:10:34] worried about he said in fact if we
[1:10:37] don't come to full Redemption we're in
[1:10:39] trouble
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:45] so truly they're waiting on us Paul is
[1:10:49] waiting them in you John talked the
[1:10:54] whole anti-bride he's in a grave
[1:10:57] somewhere and god bless his soul we know
[1:11:00] where soul is but his body's probably
[1:11:02] just dust it's been 2,000 years since
[1:11:05] he's been dead it's probably just dust
[1:11:07] gotta bring you back together he knows
[1:11:09] words that don't worry
[1:11:10] about that now he's come lamb come up
[1:11:15] for the throne he'd been slain blood all
[1:11:18] over him he was the one that was found
[1:11:19] worthy and when he reached over and took
[1:11:21] the book then everything began shouting
[1:11:23] screaming carrying on you see because
[1:11:25] they know Redemption was paid for now he
[1:11:28] comes to claim his own so he takes the
[1:11:30] book stands out there before John and he
[1:11:33] pulls it back and breaks to seal pulls
[1:11:36] the seal down and when he pulls the seal
[1:11:39] down a thunderclap through the place and
[1:11:42] when a thunderclap no doubt John might
[1:11:46] have jumped up in the air when the
[1:11:47] thunder roared and then one of the four
[1:11:50] beasts now look what are the four beasts
[1:11:52] the four beasts is the Holy Ghost we can
[1:11:56] get into the line ox and all those but
[1:11:58] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost God
[1:12:00] sent the Holy Ghost to what lead us and
[1:12:03] guide us into all truth but there is a
[1:12:07] lion anointing there's an ox anointing
[1:12:09] there is a man anointing and there's an
[1:12:11] eagle anointing that brings us through
[1:12:13] the steps of the baptism of the holy oak
[1:12:15] all right it's not for different holy go
[1:12:18] okay because you and I need the boldness
[1:12:22] of a line the work of an ox we have to
[1:12:25] have the intelligence of man not that
[1:12:28] man I'm gonna buy a man a man that's not
[1:12:31] man's intelligence no but what God did
[1:12:36] know is during that time of the man
[1:12:38] intelligence he brought Luther and
[1:12:40] Wesley and that's when the printing
[1:12:41] presses started that's when man was able
[1:12:43] to put this book together so people
[1:12:45] could read it and then so he did use the
[1:12:48] intelligence of man but one of the four
[1:12:50] beasts is now come and see what it is
[1:12:52] what's revealed beneath there remember
[1:12:57] we're talking about that what's beneath
[1:13:00] here it wasn't a seal it was what was
[1:13:03] underneath all right so John goes to
[1:13:07] look see what it is John goes to see
[1:13:10] what that's understand it's then that
[1:13:12] this creature told John come and see
[1:13:15] what the mystery is under the first seal
[1:13:17] the thunder the voice of the Creator has
[1:13:21] uttered it's not a voice of a man
[1:13:24] and watch seven people not seven men
[1:13:26] it's the voice of the Creator now he
[1:13:32] ought to know what's there it's kind of
[1:13:36] plain but faint now he wrote this but
[1:13:39] when he started to write those seven
[1:13:41] other seven thunders he said don't write
[1:13:44] them he'd been commissioned to write
[1:13:46] everything he sang but when these seven
[1:13:49] thunders over in Revelations 10 uttered
[1:13:51] he said don't write them at all
[1:13:54] their mysteries we don't know what they
[1:13:58] are yet but my opinion they'll be
[1:14:02] revealed right away and when it do it'll
[1:14:05] give faith for that rapture and grace
[1:14:07] for that church to move out now the only
[1:14:09] thing that then then stop the quote for
[1:14:12] a second the only thing I see then it's
[1:14:15] the is the thunders is for rapturing
[1:14:18] faith when that ratcheting faith has to
[1:14:20] have a body change in there somewhere
[1:14:23] we can't take a rapture without the body
[1:14:26] change so let's just let's just we're
[1:14:29] not assuming that's a fact
[1:14:31] we can't take a body change after the
[1:14:35] rapture so we got to take the body
[1:14:39] change first well we just moved through
[1:14:47] everything that we know of look through
[1:14:49] all we just move through everything that
[1:14:52] we know of through all the dispensations
[1:14:55] we've watched everything we just talked
[1:14:57] about them just now we've seen the
[1:14:59] mysteries of God see what saying we've
[1:15:03] seen the mysteries of God we've seen the
[1:15:08] appearing of the great gallery together
[1:15:11] of the bride in the last days but yet
[1:15:14] there's something in there that we just
[1:15:17] can't lighten ourselves with there's
[1:15:20] something another but I imagine when the
[1:15:23] mistress begins to come forth God said
[1:15:25] hold it back now wait a minute
[1:15:27] I'll reveal it in that day don't ride it
[1:15:30] all John look comes down stagger over it
[1:15:36] man staggers over
[1:15:38] Redemption right much less full
[1:15:42] redemption but less showing that a
[1:15:45] mortal man that was born in sin shaping
[1:15:48] in a necklace by from his mother's womb
[1:15:49] in life can be changed in the moment in
[1:15:52] the twinkling of an eye and have a body
[1:15:54] like Jesus's body and not ever have to
[1:15:56] worry about it deteriorating or ever
[1:15:58] have to worry about a pain cuz they'll
[1:16:01] stagger over it now listen you and I
[1:16:03] shouldn't stagger over that just let it
[1:16:09] go
[1:16:09] see but I'll reveal it in that day when
[1:16:12] it has need to done Paul didn't need it
[1:16:19] right
[1:16:21] Iranians didn't need it Luther didn't
[1:16:23] need it Wesley didn't need it Pentecost
[1:16:25] didn't need it this has come now to the
[1:16:28] needy time we need it now this right
[1:16:32] here is now not history its present all
[1:16:40] the profit preach the good message and
[1:16:44] that's okay listen to build our faith we
[1:16:48] need to stinking and somebody saying
[1:16:50] something other day about just you know
[1:16:52] going through and listening to the
[1:16:53] prayer lines that's okay that's alright
[1:16:55] that's not wrapped in faith that will
[1:17:00] help you that'll help you sure but
[1:17:03] that's not wrapped in faith brother
[1:17:04] Browne said it wasn't he said not me
[1:17:06] years of preparation not in the healing
[1:17:09] campaign he said but when that messenger
[1:17:11] brings his message they really enjoyed
[1:17:14] that hurry who we did the church ages in
[1:17:17] the and the gap there in the and the
[1:17:19] headstone coming in brother Tim said
[1:17:21] about five times he really enjoyed how
[1:17:23] we brought it out but that's something
[1:17:24] we got all get our mind out of the
[1:17:27] church ages he that overcomes going to
[1:17:31] get something but 100 percent of the

[1:18:13] gonna sit here another ten years and go
