know you can talk to and and um and being part of the message like we were talking about people like Dad different ones years ago um Blaze the trail so that we could we could preach more free and and have Liberty to preach the gospel because they you know they they were in the bushes and hedges with all the different doctrines and and we've heard them and you've heard some and thank God if you've never heard of them but there's been some really strange ones and bad ones and and brother Dale and the different ones of that group has just they just mowed everything down and made it better for for young people like me and brother Willie to uh to be able to bring a message that I'm like him it's the greatest message ever was on the face of the Earth God did send us a prophet amen but more important he sent his word through that Prophet so that we have to don't have to depend on that Prophet to come back hello somebody we ain't got to depend on that profit to come back and tell us anything he's already told us that's right he made he made the the Bible so much clearer he gave us Clarity and and freedom to be able to know the mind of God not guess that it's the mind of God but to know the mind of God and know what the plan is you know we've been preaching on the same thing Plan of Redemption you know just everything hinges around the planet of Redemption all right and uh let's uh let's listen to our brother give him time he can come on and let's sing whatever you want to sing you pick it you're the you're the song leader so everybody like brother Michael does a good job of leading singing that he does a good job downstairs doing the the young adult Sunday school class but the only thing the problem I got I didn't have to have I didn't have to cook make cookies

me up that that might be a task but you know I I sing a little bit different and uh the only person that could kind of my wife she don't have no problems she been praying for me for a long time and maybe my son but you know don't don't fall out or nothing like that just assisted him you may be seated I'm just gonna sing a little course of this song I like I like to sing this song every now and

Lord I love you more amen amen amen amen we appreciate the Lord this this afternoon amen singing that song just kind of brings back memories of sister Lewis uh I had the privilege of pastoring her for a few years that's brother Jack's that's my aunt and brother Jack's hot I she's my aunt through marriage and that's brother Jax uh his mother's sister and uh there'll be times in church you a preacher be preaching and she'd be writing songs it's just so unfortunate that she she passed away uh when she did because she left behind hundreds and hundreds of songs that she never had the opportunity to just even put music too and uh we don't even know where to find half of the things that she wrote uh that we could try to put music but we thank God for the things that uh she did and my my wife kind of put the always had to put the tune to it they would write it but my wife would kind of put produce it for him so we appreciate it it's a blessing to know that that song has circled the world amen amen let us read our scripture uh this evening um Philippians chapter four we just like to say how much we've appreciated it's I know it's it's the kind of a whirlwind short trip but uh sometimes that's the way that you have to do it but I've I've felt welcome since I've been here and uh like I say I salute uh brother Samuel Dale for uh all of the efforts that those uh Elders put forth to make it easy so that we could begin to even understand what we had and what what we we were preaching I remember when I first started preaching uh uh I didn't really know what I was preaching didn't really have a grasp and and then God threw me in the deep and say now you're going to take this church over and I'm like huh you got to be kidding me no it's no joke you got to do it and and uh so by the grace of God it was it was a blessing that we had the opportunity to uh by way of of uh medium to just come across Great Men of God that had already uh had it kind of broken down so that we could halfway understand it and then the rest God had to just kind of Quicken it to us and so uh my hat's off to them and I appreciate him uh very much for his his just his effort and his stand in this area I know that it was not easy with my little portion that I've been able to do I know it hasn't been easy so them coming up during a time where it wasn't broken down we didn't have mp3s and we didn't have all of this you know Brothers used to come to the poor pit with a stack of quote books like this see uh I'll call that the tail end of those area those errors but we thank God for him and for his his wife he never could have done it by himself we thank God for her right we we like to salute the men of God but also without the women of God you know by that side giving them strength you know uh behind the scenes uh they wouldn't be able to do what they do so we appreciate the Lord also brother Dale's wife where she's at brother Dale okay there she go so we we we appreciate y'all so standing in standing in the gap amen and that just goes for every Minister that just goes for all of us we we what are we without our wives amen okay let us let us read the scripture and uh we'll we'll just kind of get started and just see how the Lord will lead us uh the 18th verse you said but I have all and abound and I am full having received of I'm not going to try to pronounce that the things which were sent from you and odor of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God but my God shall supply all of your needs according to riches and glory and by Christ Jesus gracious father we just thank you we praise your God this evening we just trust that you'll just have your way in the service of God this evening we thank you for all things in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated uh we like we say we're using it as a topic uh the purpose of the crushing in this morning we were just trying to draw a background and just help us to understand that you know we we serve a sovereign God and and you know when you could understand the purposes and the whys this it's like you know driving a car you know we we have things in it and to the carnal mind you might why why is all this in there well it's the thing that's needed it's the things that's necessary to be able to get that thing down the road right amen no matter how pretty it pretty it is if you don't have no matter if you got electrical carb you got a gas car without the batteries and electrical that thing ain't moving it look nice in your yard you've been shining and you can polish it all you want to you know but but you gotta you gotta have some batteries so you gotta have some some gas and things of that nature something the power so so you have to keep those different things in mind you just don't want to we just don't want to be like the carnal world today and and you know people have their own opinions about things well this ain't necessary and that ain't necessary and and you know God this and God that see for me it's easy for me I feel like the anything that God does God did it because it was necessary it had to be done I like to say that again it had to be done and it had to be done the way that it was done right amen I mean when we think about when we think about you know the fall and sin coming into existence you know it it wasn't by chance that you know uh God will Veil himself come down a price had to be paid but the the cruelty right of sin and the price that had to be paid and him having to go through through capital punishment right but if if you look back at at the picture when when when Adam got the Revelation or not Adam oh God y'all got y'all gave me food gave me food able when Abel my mind food is sleep don't work good but but able when able got the revelation of what was what was necessary or what was needed by God right he he he dragged he dragged a a lamb and you know it wasn't pretty you know I don't know if we would have made it you're right so folk cause we like pretty things Kane Kane brought something that was beautiful something that he cultivated within himself something that you know in today's society you know people like nice stuff and you know Kane came out there man got the lamb and he went to just power just hitting it right blood blood everywhere but he needed something that he could identify himself with right and so so you know Christ could not have come and had an easy a easy death if the representation of Christ died under that was cruel come on yeah cause let's think about it if somebody held you down to start hitting you with a rock you'll be laying there like hey that's cruel buddy that that hurts and I'm bleeding yeah you know but the lamb the lamb uh uh uh sacrificed himself for you or not it wasn't a pretty picture right it wasn't you know when Eastern time come you see pink bunny rabbits and you see all of this and it's like y'all don't get it y'all really don't get it it was nothing nice Calvary wasn't nothing nice about Calvary to be drugged there you know you gotta cross you you'd have been beat you you and let let's let's say this all of that was necessary for the program of God and see here's what I like about it as as gruesome as it was it benefited me now I don't know about y'all I don't know what it done for y'all but I benefited from the cruelty God God allowed himself to go through that right because the price had to be paid I like that right it wasn't nothing nice you know thank God that you know he didn't choose me fellas because we wouldn't have been redeemed you know it was difficult so much that I mean let's let's be realistic Jesus with the Gethsemane and he was like what is there any way I could get out of this right right just just having an a knowledge of what he had to go through because let's let's face it your flesh don't want to hurt no no your flesh don't want to die is that right when the when the man of God is preaching the word of God trying to bring this subject to the word it don't want to die it don't want to give up it don't want to give in it just kind of want to have its way yeah you know and so that's why we look funny at the preacher when they preaching and we don't hardly give them a man sometime if right because you know it's it's something cutting and there's things in our lives that that we want to do you know and but God's like no that ain't gonna get you get you where you want to go is right see and so you you kind of got a doubt of that right amen but you know when I look at Calvary uh and it in the picture of Calvary it wasn't nothing easy but it it was it was necessary it was necessary right and and we benefit because of it right I might maybe want to read us a little quote uh as we kind of get started y'all all right uh quote from I know 1960 and uh we want to start maybe somewhere around the 74th or 75th verse maybe the 75th verse it says see it it takes a crucifixion right amen uh we think that Christianity is just this you know nice something hey somebody should have told me I thank God for it now when I first became a Christian I didn't I didn't know what was going to take place you know I was just like praise the Lord I'm glad I'm saved right but then I started realizing yeah you say But You Gotta Die there's a there's across the bear right amen he said it takes a crucifixion it takes a crushing of a flower right to bring the perfume from it yeah it takes a crushing of a life I like this part to get the best out of it was kind of preluding to some of the things that I want to say it I now you know more than ever I understand why God allows and I've I've been going through a lot of things the last five years right but I realized that God saw that it was so important to just crush me yeah I realize I got a greater understanding now right right it's like God crushing me realizing that there was more there that he wanted to kind of get out of me to make a better make me a better version of my previous self and and that was the only setup that only provided way in order to get out of us what's in US is that right amen God purpose that yeah right to to crush right that's just God's method yeah right and sometimes we don't like it especially modern-day Christianity right we like this this cute religion now yeah if you kind of look at the nominal World they got this real cute religion with cute Sands you know a modernistic uh easteristic if I could use that term type of Christianity of beautiful flowers and and and uh you know praise and everything is nice and and nothing is crushing nothing is cutting right but everything is nice right but I don't want that because that that won't bring out the the realness right the fullness of Christ right amen it it takes it takes a crushing amen amen see I was enjoying the brothers Sunday school lesson see it it takes that ideology away so that we we can really understand God's provision and how God uses things right and what God does things so when when God starts to crush us we don't bail out right we we just kind of say Okay God if if you brought me to it you'll bring me through it all right if you're allowing me to be crushed it it has its purpose it's it's for a reason that's something that you know you're trying to get out of me get from me and it just takes this it takes this it took a crushing glory to God Amen see it takes the the crucifixion it takes a crushing of the flower to bring out the perfume no crushing no perfume right glory to God amen amen it's got to be God's provided way you know God has a provided way for a baby to get right we you intellectualize it and okay baby you know when you need something put this little bell up here baby like I gotta bail for y'all right you go here too it's gonna be loud and long till you get up in here it's kind of you know and I'll say that we we've got to be careful even around the word of God now I don't gotta believe in legalism but I I you know I I still believe that you gotta come God's provided wait also right so if God sees this it's necessary uh uh it's necessary amen who starts supersedes the thoughts of God who who did God consider when he was putting his plan in program amen uh into order if I could use that term right glory to God I he definitely didn't want my opinion because I would have been like whatever you do you could crush them don't crush me I don't want to go through anything right but it don't it don't work like that it don't work like that amen glory and I'm and I'm grateful for that more so now than than ever you know as we're we're nearing the coming of the Lord and and we're trying God is is trying to get us you know and and Rapture and condition um I believe he got the crutches a little bit more you gotta crush this it's still so much that I think that you know we we're converted but we're still things that we're holding on too glory to his wonderful day I'm guilty too I'm not one of those types of preachers because I I got a suit and a tie but I'm a human being yeah right and that's human elements and and the world is sticky right right and and we all in a contest right and the devil's trying to pull all of us so it's it's I'm in a battle every preacher could say he's in in a battle my battle may not be brother Dale's battle but I'm quite sure he's got a battle as if it's as long as he's a human being now if he's a robot or something maybe he may not have the same battle battles but I'm quite sure he's Flesh and Blood right oh hallelujahs so he says it takes a question of a life to to get the best out of that there is he says that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was and we cannot stop right there is to bring out what we are as Sons and Daughters of God we got to go through this crushing the crushing of a life right the question of not just your dad the young people too amen right you got to be kind of crushed see it takes a crushing of a life to get the best that it is that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was he could not stand before the crucifixion and say all power in Heaven and Earth is given up into my hand but after the crucifixion so you see how necessary that was right he couldn't stand and say our power and Heaven ever is given uh to my hand but what he did do it taken a crucifixion first it taken the crushing right it it see that it took that that's that that's what it it takes right let's let's look at a a a quote from the cruelty of sin 1953. I think it's starting at verse 8. um brother brother Branham uh and one of the things we know Sin is Sin is crew yeah we we can see this this is a true age that we living in we we're seeing things that uh we did not see years ago now I I I'm reminded and you know people a little bit older than me talk about they used to could leave their doors opening go to the market and stuff like that and you only have to really worry about nobody coming into your dwelling right right you can't do that now I locked my doors I lock my car doors in my yard and I live on an acre why you knocking your doors because people have no respect it used to be a time where people would need you and you have to worry about a person coming up in here and but because there was a reverence for for ministers there was a reverence for churches now reverence for nobody right amen but we thank God that Jesus Christ you know went to carry he says uh God made every individual here go home tonight with this on their mind thinking of what a sacrifice we that's I think that's with that statement we we should always think about what a sacrifice was made for me because it's an individual thing right what did it cost to redeem yeah right and pay the price right I needed redeeming but I couldn't pay the price and to think about what he went through I benefit from that's what I like what what as cruel as it might have seen Capital uh Roman capital punishment right I benefited from that I'm able to stand here tonight because of that right could could you imagine think about it if that hadn't out of happened how could we ever begin to talk about a man Redemption I mean we saw different things under the shadow right right but we we needed a real reality to those things is that right even John on the island Patton would say who who is Worthy that could move he started weeping right but but thank God Amen God had Provisions yeah yeah right so that so that we could benefit from those things because of those things let me tell you something I'm grateful for that amen tonight being an ex drug abuser y'all don't really know how how much I appreciate what he did for me is that right and and his leadership to bring me a man to this amen present-day life come on church now I'm up here preaching and you know but man when I read quotes like that I really know because I'm really no real real bondage see if you've never been on crack and all of that you you might know a little bondage but let me tell you something when those things get you heroin and crack cocaine and all of that stuff brother let me tell you something that's real bondage alcohol and you know all sorts of perversion is that those are real real real bondages man that you need a real real real delivery and then let me tell you something I look back 35 years right I got I you know I know I would say it in the mind of God but 35 years ago I recognized who I was you know uh I always in the mind of God but I came to and a birth took place right and now I could see the word let me tell you something I don't I don't take these things for granted right I don't take these things lightly I really appreciate it appreciate these things right amen amen glory to God he he says what what a sacrifice what it calls to redeem what did it cost God yeah yeah right it it costs it costs God the greatest Price it caused Christ his life amen right man he was the rose of Sharon but to get the perfume out of the Rose you have to crush it up right his beautiful life was crushed a young man 31 and a half 33 and a half right that we watch this next statement that we might live you don't really know life until you convert it you know you don't you don't really you can't really comprehend what real life is until you convert it you know like I say yeah I was 15 before 16 and young and in church I thought man that's just for old folk I got time and you know I felt like all of that but then as you know you start getting older you realize ain't no age limit to it that I'm gonna tell you something the earlier the better yeah even the prophet makes statements like that he wish he would have got and he got he got said a relatively young age but you know what I wish I wish something would have really struck me at a really younger age where I didn't go out and and Scar my life right by the world I didn't score it all up and and I still have to live even though I'm converted and God don't remember those things no more you know the devil the Devil is a a grave robber ocean robber he goes down there to try to remind you you know but I I just kind of have to cast that stuff down and let them know that that that wasn't me that wasn't me that was somebody else in person some impersonator something of that nature but you know you you have to you have to appreciate I'll say this to every young person in here God has given you the greatest opportunity of your life take it take it right amen allow God to have the preeminence in your life and and to take control and to lead you and guide you amen no matter how the devil try to paint a picture of how how nice and how how pretty and all of those things that the world is that's only a man uh a a brown grass with a green light shining on it come on that's exactly what that is he make it seem like boy the grass is great more green over there now it's just a brown grass with a green light shining on it amen this this is greener pastures it don't get no greener not on this side it don't get no greener this right now speaks of a better speaks of a greater but you gotta accept this right now all right all right yeah man you don't you don't want to live with with all of that okay I like that he said he's the rosie but to get the perfume out of the Rose you have to be crushed come on we thank God for it right Church you you thank God uh for it because we we benefit we we benefit okay I'm trying to get this next little quote y'all all right now I'm not gonna preach three hours I ain't never been a three-hour preacher in all my life maybe two maybe two but it won't be tonight trying to get this computer see I'm old-fashioned still too but I'm trying to do do the new thing you know I'm a paper guy uh brother tell brother Dale was telling me about his dad and and uh how he used to do things and I remember those things and watching the video on how everything was just just you know he would come out and everybody would have a package of quotes and a lot of effort went into that amen it's it's easy for all the computer guys but for us it kind of computer illiterate guys this stuff is difficult I'm I'm trying to learn I'm not even with her brother Dale but he said you know what he just got smart guys in the church yeah it's about guys you know I got smart guys brother Jack is a computer major and his everything is put in order and Polished and inline and in fouls and everything else when I come up here it's like man computer just worked for me you know if it stop Act start acting up he knew how to fix it me I'll go off the cuff I'm a little old school law of Grace 1954. start at 1 13. he says now notice he said I I just feel good I do too look Jesus said he was the Rose of Sharon right he he he was offered to God as a sweet smelling savior well I'm you know I when I look at these things I'm grateful for it because let me finish this and then I'm coming and and this and then when we become unbearable before God and so to excuse the expression so sticky yeah all right I'll tell you what in the in the sovereignty of God God knew and and we we the same way we don't like nothing stink come on now unless y'all different than me I remember you know uh some years ago we used to have this guy um I don't know he was a hobo that's exactly what he was he used to jump trains I think he lived in Alabama somewhere but he would always come down to Florida somewhere he had a family and all of that but you know alcohol kind of messed them up and he used to jump trains and he would he would be in in our community and uh he would come to church from time to time I don't know what happened to him it's been years since I've seen him but I'm gonna tell you something when he would come in you knew he was in the building you you knew he was in the building and focused and squirming and and then he sat by somebody they they would move their seat you know they would move pocketbook canal because because he had a he had a smell but but I I enjoyed him you know as as brother we're a little bit different you know that the sisters we used to tolerate the smell and you couldn't really say anything to the Saints you know cause what you talking about uh months and months of smell yeah and and he needed perfume he needed a bath he needed a good washing and and he needed uh uh a perfume he needed somebody to provide for him right what was necessary to change right right how he smelled glory to God so you see you know God realizing you know what Calvary is so necessary right because you know in the flesh and in unbelief before conversion you ain't what you think you are well I'm educated I got a lot of money I'll say that again you aren't what you think you are before God right man amen Calvary was so necessary right to produce a perfume so that we could smell better huh glory to God y'all don't believe that but I'm grateful for that right so so that see had not had not Calvary taken place all that was locked up in him all of all of what was necessary and all that that we would benefit from was locked up in him it was all locked up right right amen but it needed to be released so that I could benefit from that amen amen glory to God glory to God amen cause I was smelly y'all know what I'm talking about your mama used to ever told you this oh you think you're grown now you just smelling yourself y'all like some of the old timers know what I'm talking about you smelling your Musk yeah come on you know you get they get you get to get becoming a teenager and and and you feel like you know everything yeah problem you know my uncle I remember back in the day you know me and one of my

yeah because I don't think you gonna be staying with me forever at some point you got to leave him the eagle is gonna start stirring the nests throwing all your stuff out catch it hey I want peace you know what what what was nice right yesterday when we got in town we went straight to uh brother Dale's parents house and man when I walked in there I was like wow wow everything was nice everything's in order and brother Dale say this this is a museum he said he said he say man this is a museum in here you know they polish things and I'll be like well why are you this like man my mom had I'm saying to myself one day Lord [Laughter] one day I envisioned this for myself I was kind of walking around and looking around because right now I'm remodeling my house and stuff is everywhere and I'm tripping over stuff and and then I got three boys and they Mama spoiled them and it's like I want to scream like dudes guys and they get mad when they hit when I get to talking everybody's head go down and they don't really want to hear me and I have to apologize for what I'm fixing to say ahead of time to make it easy for them to get it to comprehend cause I'm that mean Daddy when I talk I'm like EF Hutton everybody listen one of my sons used to tell me yeah Dad we know this is your house you ain't got to keep telling us yes I do evidently got to keep letting y'all know this is Miles this is not y'all won't pay no bills here y'all live here for free and they think because they give me a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred dollars here and there you know because I've you know uh I'm making them now finally they think that they doing good I wish I could go back to my mama house you know and live for 150 dollars right y'all every every husband and wife you can go back home with all of your children in everything a hundred and fifty dollars oh my goodness that'll be great feel like Tony the Tiger now great but it don't work like that you Gotta Be You gotta be responsible and that's why you got to be crushed and that's why I enjoyed the the testimony this morning right oh my I like that I'm having a good time amen he said but let's get back to it he says I I feel good look Jesus he was the rose of Sharon he was offered to God as a sweet smelling savor and and then when he become then when we become unbearable for God what US I'm going on cause y'all gonna say that's the tyrant that's the tyrant cause sometimes we do we we become unbearable before god let's think about brother Branham and and you know his his mindset when he walked into that restaurant that day and he saw he saw he saw this this old woman and the police and and just the the scenery and just look at his attitude yeah yeah you know he he like almost like Lord bring Jasmine down on this guy like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I think you need to go through some more yeah yeah right come on come over here let me talk to you a minute right let me let me let me give you a real View right of of you yourself we talk about a A God Called Prophet right but but he needed a little crush and we know he got a crushing at the early part of his ministry right and that let me that that was heartbreaking right to lose to lose as a young man your wife and and your daughter that that will I don't know if I could have handled that I don't I don't know how many men that would have been strong enough to handle that you lose your wife and your baby and almost lose you baby boy you you know because of disobedience right right because her her daddy right got in the way of what God's will was for your life and God just had to show you who was boss I'm bigger than you I'm bigger than your father-in-law now you know I have ordained you you were born for such a time as this amen you was born to fulfill scriptural purpose that will be fulfilled right right amen you know I I think it was a lot more to it than even that because brother Branham said watching his little Sharon Rose suffer the way that she suffered right he said every time cross-eyed children would get in the prayer line they've been why I like this the sovereignty of God see we could we we look at brother Branham and and and and all things work together for the good right yeah it might not be good but but God's plan that's right God's purpose right amen glory to God God allowed that to happen right God God allowed that to happen for the purpose knowing that there would be so many cross-sided children see we see this part but this part mattered to God too yeah glory to God this part mattered to God by the time by the time where brother random thought I'm paraphrasing talking about you know praying for this and you know different people and different things and and God sent the uh a mother possum to him right yeah God was concerned come on right yes when Humanity probably want to just take the gun because I know if that was me In the Flesh and no leading I thought it was just random house got a gun just boom right absolutely but God was concerned right about that mother possum yeah God was amen not that Humanity was right but God was God said I got a man on the Earth go to him he'll get you he he'll get you what's needed right right I've crushed him enough right yeah yeah in him is is ability to pray right he'll get you on your feet right glory to God right so it's necessary see what was in Jesus Christ I need it yeah yeah man I need it I need it blunt right right I need healing because you can't preach one without the other you can't believe Redemption without healing and I heard him talk about sick people right so that was needed God knew that which is Stripes right man oh that was cruel it was yeah you know what sometimes you know thinking about what people go through things aren't always nice right that we go through right but it's so necessary sometimes for us to go through that to experience these things glory to God see I could talk about things that if if you never was on drugs you can't really talk about it see you can't really really intellectually maybe if you study enough books or something well I don't have to study books to talk to you about you know drug addictions and gang violence and all that I don't have to talk to you about from book knowledge I could talk from personal experience right right and and we're living in an age now of gang culture more so than it's ever been right and the influence and the impact yeah right and these things got to be preached around the revealed word because there's a constant tug and pull on our Young Generation I mean you know this this like I said earlier this this building shouldn't be able to hold uh bye the amount of people that's probably come in and out in the families and their children and you know sometimes their children's children I think back you know coming up and and and and you know in the different churches the churches that I pastored and the churches are more part of the amount of people that have come in the doors and sat for a season and and and all of that if if they were there and their families and their children and their children and children my God we'd have to build big buildings but I guess the scriptures say fear not little flock and so you just have to appreciate being a Christian amen hey you gotta appreciate you gotta pre really appreciate having uh servants like you know uh I've met today and that I've known you you can't take that for granted no no right uh that's not that's not skim milk to have somebody who who is willing to put themselves on the line right right and Pastor in the church for 23 years I think just about everybody in the building talked about me in a negative life and all I was ever trying to do was to point them to Jesus Christ better smile I need to talk to you okay I I just talked about you and I just they're not gonna fully tell you what everything they said but they just gonna tell you just enough I totally and then they break down and crying and all that and and I'm a man I'm a human being you know you have to you have to say sister brother you know I forgive you you know and come out the next service and still preach Christ to him and and not be offended not holding it animosity uh nothing nothing of that nature cause you got to realize they were anointed by the devil to give you a try that's right to crush you to make you to make you that much more dependent upon him all right bro right glory to God I was telling him when I was when I was preaching this message at home you know uh and I probably get to the quote here but I just kind of get it out there you know he was the lily of the valley and and from that and from that Lily when it's crushed we get opium right we get opium opium is is for uh soothing yeah yeah I don't know about y'all but I think I I wouldn't be here this this this afternoon if it wasn't for the opium come on something something that'll give me a piece that are quiet right that something that that that quiets my spirit when it just seemed like you know my world is falling apart and I don't have the answers to the questions right it just this this something that I because of Calvary that that's been given that I benefit right I benefit from it see this this opium it keeps me llow it keeps me from like Ping you know it just keeps me even kill even kill no I try to I try to be yeah every now and then I get a little riled up but then he comes in to keep me settled especially especially you know all of us because we rub elbows with the world most of us still in the workforce and we dealing with bosses and and and just people who aren't converting and things of that name you need something that'll give you a peace when you come home when you want something that settles you when you clock out and you sit in your car and you take a deep breath and say boy I'm glad the mate I was over something that'll give you a piece that when you get to the door of your house you don't explode on your wife when she say hey honey yeah and you know come on somebody a vice versa you know some of the sisters still work you know you get to the door and and you like kids screaming and hollering and you like yeah yeah right y'all know what I'm talking about I had six little ones they were stair steps right and that was good when they was out but when they was home they were everywhere into everything but they were screaming and that was hollering and that was having a good time but Daddy just got off work work hard construction is hard yeah yeah construction is hard on the body especially the older you get and then not only that Daddy got a church and people be calling you and you got to study and they Holland they don't care because they're kids and you just can't always say out and shut up you gotta let them be kids you gotta let them unwind yeah this might be helping somebody who ain't got no kids yet that's gonna have some kids you gotta let them get it out so that when eight o'clock comes they didn't got it all along then they can go to sleep yeah even if you don't get none right yeah but but you don't have some opium yeah yeah huh and you on a high not like this this stuff they got out now it's Fentanyl and all that this stuff that'll kill you this won't kill you this this has no after effects to it right come on oh y'all just think y'all calm and peaceful on your own y'all ain't went off and swung on somebody on your own no y'all benefit from what amen I benefit from because he was crushed he was crushed you could be even killed yeah you know you could keep it together you benefit glory to God Amen Hallelujah because when I was in sin buddy we fought all the time now it's like man I ain't got time for that I just want to relax enjoy life be positive right amen but I thank God for the question amen yes sir right not Calvary but also person on a personal note right amen right I thank God because by that amen it causes me to express more of the god that's in me right amen amen his character's a victory yeah you got to go through some stuff see amen and listen others others benefit right but what we've gone through see I benefit by by what brother uh Dale and and those other ministers Mike all Teague and some of those those guys you know the fights that they had right Glory somebody had to do it somebody had to do it and God ordained for them to do it right and and I benefit from that I don't take that for granted yeah yeah that's that's a blessing to me and and even in my many years of of ministering uh you know sometimes I go back to the the older ministers right and just you know still gleam glory to his wonderful name glean from the things that that you know they might not be spinning around like the young guys but they have so much to say so much wisdom you know uh I don't I don't too much run the aisles anymore and kick and stomp but but out of all the years you know God has given us something that we could help this oncoming generation right amen and and we could give to the younger ministers coming up and help them to see it's it's a lot more to it than kicking and stomping and getting the people riled up you know but but to give them a substance right that when they leave the church they could ponder over they could think about something that that are helped in their growth right because when you 20 you ain't went through much of nothing yeah I just have to say it like that uh but by the time you get 40 and 60 right you got really got something to say right right because you you don't went through a whole a whole lot of a whole lot of stuff like like the brother who was saying this morning I enjoyed that it's like you you you you get older and God quickens got quickens things to you and you you start to realize and you know what I need to be able to impart these things uh to this younger generation right younger younger men coming up right so that so that they don't enter into uh these these these lives with no Direction well you know yeah she cute she ain't had no babies she might be a Coca-Cola today tomorrow she could be a two leader [Laughter] you don't know uh and and he got he got abs and six packs and knowing years he got dresser drawers you know you can pack stuffy all right but but you have to have a knowledge you have to have a knowledge and understand your role and and have some direction of of where you're going not just oh I'm in love that's wonderful but what are you doing yeah what's your vision what's your vision for your family come on what's your vision for your wife right right yeah yeah what what's your vision what are you doing what are you gonna do how are you going to care for all right what's what's the necessary sacrifices that you got to make as as a man in your role to make her happy right right because there's more to it than that just say sanctify Holy Ghost fear going to church Wednesday and Sunday yeah she gonna need more than that buddy and full of the full of children in there you gotta have you gotta have a real Vision right right you you you gotta understand you gotta be looking at these things now if you're not married have a vision yeah where you going where you gonna take this where you you know we ultimately going in the Rapture together but you know have it ha travel halfway have things planned out right and then have God to lead you but like me when I got married I just wanted to be married God gave me a wonderful uh sister in the message and you know and I was yeah but I didn't have a clue because I didn't have I had a daddy but he wasn't much because he didn't have a vision for my mama and then she you know all of the the stepdads I had they didn't have a vision they couldn't tell me nothing so so so I I walked into those things blindly right and you know for me I don't want for a younger generation of men young Christian men to do that always educate yourself keep educating yourself amen right yeah every year try to educate yeah that that's just you know also it's older older guys too we got to continue to educate ourselves and have a vision for our wives and for our families you know uh that nothing falls through the cracks I I trust that that was all right aim it it I'm not a long-winded preacher I give you about an hour and 15 hour and I'm done you know uh I learned that as you get older you know you don't try to because you can't tell it all at one time it's it's it's just too much it's constantly be unfolding but we we trust that we were able to express a little something that was on our heart and that that um you just take your portion from what was said and and you ponder it you pray on it and let God Quicken more of it to you right and and it'll benefit us we appreciate we appreciate the opportunity we appreciate the pastors for allowing me to be here um this weekend and uh maybe we come back we'll preach three hours entirely no I I don't think that's that's in me I couldn't take a three-hour message myself I know some brothers though when I was coming up man it was something some preachers would preach you talk for an hour and a half and say let's go straight to the word it's like huh what you been doing for an hour and a half if that wasn't a word and then they want to go another hour and a half you done it yeah but we appreciate let us stand we have a word of prayer and I turn it back over to brother Dale by the way of the damn as the musicians to make their way hey man anybody need any Prejudice sure about and lifting their hands y'all pray for me amen it gotta give me strength gracious father we just thank you oh God you see the hands that went up this afternoon uh we pray that you'll just bless your people you know their hearts you know their needs I just thank you and I praise your God tonight I appreciate you oh God for allowing us to be here and to be able to speak and just say something that we trust that's been encouraging Lord and uh appreciate uh brother Samuel and brother Wade this weekend and for the hospitality and the fellowship pray that you just continue to bless this portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ and increase uh their territory Lord God we appreciate you oh God tonight we just thank you for all things in Jesus name amen amen [Applause] amen it's good when you come to church and you hear the word of God and you get some life lessons to go with it because you know what we're Christians but we got life what's the old saying life happens yeah but when you get eternal life that life happens happens a little bit different let's let's give our brother another good hand you know as we were we're speaking on the Statue of perfect man he and I were we were talking about it that takes a crushing too it takes a crushing it takes a crushing all the time to crush us out so that Christ can live in squeeze us I mean Ring us out and that's why a good preaching when you when when you hear good preaching it it it should release you and it should take some of the burden off of you and it should help you to tomorrow on Monday to uh to to go to work or to live your life just a little bit different because you know old Diablo he's going to be here you know he's the devil's going to be around but you don't have to you don't have to do what he says right you don't have to do what he says there's no way he can make you do what he tells you to do you have to do it willingly so we'll just resist the devil and he'll flee from us and we appreciate our brother and let's let's sing a song if anybody has a need or anything else let's think of a couple of verses and then we've gotta get him to Atlanta to get on a plane so let's sing a song Let's worship just for a little bit you will survive D behind us [Music] protected think about it yes he was [Music] and what do you do he thought of me it wasn't for him it was for me and you above all sing it to him [Music] laid behind the storms you live to die rejected and alone like a rose [Music] he did and he thought of me and you Jesus [Music] thank you Lord [Music] You're the property guy said he said don't ask to forget Calvary I know we become Believers and gave us the opportunity to be here and give us opportunity to hear the message of the hours our brother said what greater opportunity I know we all have opportunities to do better in our life but man you look out in that world and you see they never and some of them are never even gonna know who Jesus Christ is amen unless you tell them about him and if we can't get to all of them I feel sorry for them all that's why we need to tell people about Calvary first before we tell them God sent a prophet amen God did send himself first then he sent us a prophet to give us Clarity and to give us um more Revelation than than the world but not without Calvary no without Jesus Christ the Bible says you can't even know him without the Holy Ghost and now we know how to get the Holy Ghost because we God sent us a prophet it wasn't shouting it wasn't speaking in tongues it wasn't shaking the hands my brother said it wasn't writing on a book or writing on a on a piece of paper no it's a birth yes it's something you have to die to get amen if he had to die to give it to you you got to die to get it you got to die to yourself and let him crush us you think man that's tough but you know what a crushing blow at the Garden of Eden there was Adam he never felt a pain in his life Eve never felt the pain in the in her life never a heartache or a trial um the Lions could walk through the kitchen and right out the back door and no problem right everything was in harmony and then all of a sudden something happened it was a crushing blow to humanity but it had to happen so that God could come and be crushed and give us eternal life please let don't ever forget that don't ever forget what he did for us and the way we show it back is we tell people you know brother Brown says tell people how you got how you how you like got lit well tell them how you got crushed tell them how God took a piece of clay you know you Mary Magdalene when she was at the feet of Jesus she had a little box right the song you know about the alabaster box amen there was no way that odor could have got out until she crushed him that odor no matter how sweet no matter how odorous it was it was trapped inside that piece of clay until she broke the lid and everybody smelled it because Judas was complaining about using all of it and everybody was smelling it only by being crushed did people get to smell the odor that was in that Alabaster Box sometimes he has to do that with us he has to crush us he has to give us a blow that sometimes it maybe you know we're not gonna we just don't feel like we're gonna make it but we're here we gotta fight be brave as the song says against all evil right and keep moving forward keep going on with God if you got issues in your life just keep praying keep keep doing whatever you need to do to get that thing cleared up right we're here to help you all we can help you if you need help we're here to listen to you to you and and you know you you take somebody like brother brother Smiley and and um and you you just you watch even the mannerisms you haven't lost being a pastor you know so you you just see the mannerisms of how he how he does it so much care about your flesh he said I ain't worried about your flesh I ain't worried about your feelings I'm talking to your soul today I'm talking to that real person down inside of you it may cut you and hurt your feelings but what brother they'll always tell us what are you tell us to put our feelings in our pocket and sit on them brother Willie's smiling he's probably heard him if he's hurt him enough and that's what we need to put our feelings and not let our feelings get involved but we're human beings and guess what we're full of feelings from the top of our head to the ball of our feet so we've got to what Crush that all that we've got to get out and let it out and let's go on with God you love the Lord amen thank you all for being here we appreciate all of you coming Brother Willie again thank you so very much I I love it I don't bring a lot of times I don't bring people here from me I bring them for you and I tell them I tell them everyone thank you for helping my people if you can help my people I'm not worried about nothing else I'm not worried about me or any or anything else well we went to eat or how the how the room was or how I got to take him two hours down to the airport and then two hours back is to help you guys is to help us all we all benefit from that every one of us do and uh and I know brother Smiley he felt comfortable today and I appreciate that that he did did feel comfortable and felt right at home because that's where he was supposed to be he said he had to go to the bathroom and he said I don't want to walk down through them people I said they're your family amen that's right when I'm at home if I gotta goal yeah I'm going to go I ain't gonna say no I gotta walk past mama and daddy in town but no they family I just walked right on by him and go and do what I need to do your face is red we're going to try to do something about that but it is kind of rough having to if you need to go to be in there and got to walk down through here but uh but we're just family members we should feel comfortable around each other even though we came from totally different Mamas and totally different daddies Earthly we came from one heavenly father if you're born again and we've got his genetics running through our veins now and we we've got as brother Brown says we've got his potential right as brother Willis said he's got him he was broke though so he could give us those or he just took them all with him no he didn't want to do that his whole purpose was to have a group of people that acted like him that's what he wanted a group of people that act just like him that's why he gave us a statue of perfect man that's why he give us three and a half years of his life and died and then came back and went inside of you not to be with you but to be in you amen and then take complete control of your life and we we're heading toward that right amen all mine's clear y'all pray for us that there won't be any traffic and we'll get down to the airport and and get him back home to Okeechobee Florida ain't nothing down there but a big old Lake and some fishing but we sure want him to come back again we don't want it to be uh um years and years and him and brother Jack both that we just appreciate ministers that come in and and um and pour the heart out and that's what I want that pour the heart out they're they're worthy of their higher women and I were talking you know like Dad and different ones the older ones it's a it takes a toll that brother Brown told us that one sermon was an eight equivalent of working eight hours think of how many sermons y'all preach after your eight hours you worked right right you know Dad worked at GM and brother Whitley he hanged sheetrock and and finishes so he's not just got a desk job he works hard thank goodness he's taller I told him he didn't need stilts to stand on but he said he still did wear stilts every once in a while but he don't get on him now he said if he followed hurt himself that's right so they won't let him on stilts anymore so uh no more he said no more well it was good to have brother brother Smiley with us and we appreciate him and just just pray for her we'll get him back maybe later on in the year but just pray for us as we go down there and and pray for everybody to have a wonderful week and come back Wednesday night and then remember next weekend all right Sunday first service will be regular service we'll have communion all right and then the second service start at 2 or 2 30 if we run too long two or two thirty we'll have water baptism we'll have a bow renewal uh we'll probably have the water baptism last so that anybody wants to be baptized they won't have to come back in and wet clothes we'll have clothes you bring your clothes and we've got towels that we can use but we'll do the vowel renewal we'll do the baby dedication or if you want to just dedicate your life to the Lord all over again then we'll have that service next Sunday afternoon that will be the whole service and then we'll go have a water baptism and then you can stand fellowship if you want to so just keep all that in prayer keep everything that that you've got in your heart about your family and your friends and and I'm like brother Whitley if if we honestly had everybody that went through this church in the past 25 or 30 years yeah we'd have to build twice the size well you think I I think I'm running sorry I'm running through my head you know that Robbie all right then you got your kids your kids all the ones that you amen if they're all sitting here you know that's what that's what I want I want them all sitting here well if you do then we're gonna have to build a double decker but you know what that's what I want all right or I wouldn't call their name or I wouldn't I wouldn't want to pray for each one of the family we're not a complete real family you know you know taking a minute sorry but Bob's gone and and Joe's gone there's a part of my family missing today and I feel that the Lord's I'm standing right here today and behind the pulpit I feel that every time some of y'all are gone or or leave and go somewhere and that's okay that you do I'm just praying you come back but you know if you go off somewhere right Anderson and Anna I don't know if I'm gonna let them go or not and Sarah and David I just don't I don't know if I can do without them for a couple of months but that's family and then Mary's going with them too so and the milk is not here who's your mama Virginia she's at the Virginia meetings at the Virginia oh okay yeah they're having a yeah they're having a camp meeting up there the big tent that's wonderful that's good but you miss them we miss all that we and we miss our family members and I wanted to be that way that we are a tight-knit family that we do miss and uh and if we do somebody disappears we try to find out where they go right don't not to be nosy but to find out if you know family there's family members I want them all we want all our family sitting around the table never have I seen dad mom as happy as when we ever won now sometimes then bright brother and sister of mine is a little different but but when we get them all together Mom and Dad's the happiest I mean so that's what it with the with the Lord he's the happiest when we're all together he's the happiest when we're all here worshiping the Lord we're all sitting around the table we'll get to do that one day sister cleat and I were talking today and she was talking about remembering things you know the Bible says behold all things will be made new the former things will pass away thank God see we carry that with us and that's the load that we carry is the things we did as brother Willie was talking about he can't deny his life he knows what he was at where he was at but one day that's all going to be a load gone man that's enough to shout about yes sir amen that all that's gone I mean we know it's gone already in the mind of God but it's gone from me and you God will so wash our brain till we have nothing but new thoughts and we remember the good things we'll remember we had kids we'll remember that we had you know parents and and things like that because we can't forget them uh brother Brown said you'll know who you were married to so so everything's not going it's not going to just totally blank your mind no you're going to remember the good things the time you got saved I don't think you'll ever forget the time you got saved that's right amen I think that's something that you'll remember and you'll know it cherish it and it'll be part of you for eternity you'll know the day that you got born again and I appreciate the Lord for letting us keep that part and keep the part of all the good things that we have the good times we've had together the talks that we've had to eat with each other and the fellowship to go out and eat or sitting here around the church service man that was a good church service from Brother Willie came preached for us back then yeah it was where is brother William I don't know he's probably going somewhere but uh but oh he'll be back in just a second you know travel after all we'll go find him we'll we'll find each other and we'll have a happy time just hang on people it's not very long and it's not a fairy tale this is more real than what you're sitting in today fans that promise and assurity it is more real than what you are now because what we are now is going to pass away you understand what I'm talking about not not completely annihilate you know we know we're we're well taught but but we'll have a time to where all this will be fond memories amen
