[8:55] amen amen
[8:57] Lord bless you all and I trust that you
[8:59] are doing well amen
[9:03] if we want to we want to turn to the
[9:07] Scriptures in Psalms chapter 37 Psalms
[9:11] chapter 37 amen in verse 23 verse 23
[9:26] substance of steps of a good man are
[9:29] ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in
[9:33] his way though he fall he shall not be
[9:39] utterly cast down I like that for the
[9:44] lord upholdeth him with his hand amen
[9:48] praise the Lord Jesus well you may be
[9:50] seated this afternoon amen
[9:54] I like that scripture and that's one
[9:58] scripture that I've always had in my
[10:00] mind ever since I was a young man when I
[10:04] was in high school in ninth grade I went
[10:06] to Bob Jones Academy in Greenville South
[10:09] Carolina after going the public school
[10:12] for a while and my mom and dad you know
[10:17] they thought that by taking me out of
[10:19] public school and putting me in a
[10:21] Christian school that everything you
[10:22] know that everything was okay everybody
[10:24] there loved the Lord and everybody but
[10:27] it was far from the truth it's it's you
[10:31] got more rebellious kids there than you
[10:33] probably have in the public school and
[10:35] bar because partly 50% of them don't
[10:38] want to be there they're forced to be
[10:40] there so of course you know and then
[10:43] all that you know you get you get armed
[10:47] with the wrong crowd and here you go at
[10:49] private school where your mom and dad
[10:51] said you know going to school and
[10:53] they're gonna come out real true
[10:55] Christians you know and that's what's
[10:57] where everything went downhill for me
[10:59] amen until God amen God in His mercy
[11:02] amen though he fall he shall not utterly
[11:06] be passed down amen because the Lord
[11:08] upholds him with his hand amen and so
[11:11] there and when I was in the Baptist
[11:14] Church that was one of the scriptures
[11:16] that that that really always draw my
[11:18] attention because during the time that I
[11:21] was out and sin and doing things I
[11:23] wasn't supposed to be and and you know
[11:26] going through the motions of life you
[11:28] know trying to find who who who myself
[11:31] you know who whatever what is it that I
[11:33] wanted to do in life and then when these
[11:35] scriptures really I was wanting certain
[11:38] my flesh in my in my the spirit wanted
[11:40] things of the world but then when the
[11:43] Word of God like this would come amen
[11:45] it would put me to think and say Lord
[11:47] this is really me this is really me
[11:49] although I want I'm putting the facade
[11:51] in front of my friends like this but
[11:52] this is really me right here
[11:54] so this scripture was really special to
[11:55] me and I wanted to read it tonight
[11:57] because we want to talk about a man by
[12:03] the name of Asaph Amen how many have
[12:05] heard of Asaph before amen and SF in the
[12:09] Bible he he's very interesting and wrote
[12:12] several of the Psalms actually in the
[12:15] Bible actually he he wrote more of the
[12:19] scripture than then some of the Apostles
[12:21] did in the New Testament Peter a lot of
[12:25] the several of the Psalms are attributed
[12:26] to him and so we want to talk to him we
[12:29] want to talk about him amen and just
[12:31] look at a a specific Psalm that he wrote
[12:34] that he wrote amen and in Psalms chapter
[12:37] 73 amen and if I want to give this a
[12:41] title I want to title it when a
[12:43] Christian has a case of the Asaph
[12:46] when a Christian has a case of the a
[12:48] SEFs because when we read this this
[12:50] Psalm here in just a moment I'm sure
[12:52] that we all can identify with this Amen
[12:55] many times that many things that we go
[12:57] through in our life and things that we
[13:00] ask ourselves you know I mean have you
[13:03] ever asked yourself have you ever been
[13:06] disillusioned by people many times you
[13:11] think people are a certain way and then
[13:13] later they come that you come to find
[13:14] out they're not that way you're you're
[13:18] hurt you know even by your own family
[13:22] you can be hurt those probably the first
[13:25] ones that would hurt you a man you
[13:27] disillusioned by people Asaph went
[13:29] through something like that amen
[13:31] sometimes we ask ourselves you know why
[13:33] is it that things in our life don't work
[13:35] out just exactly the way we thought they
[13:37] were supposed to work out that way we
[13:39] were going this direction we thought
[13:41] everything was was just that way
[13:43] everything was or going honky-dory
[13:45] everything was fine and all of a sudden
[13:47] God just throws in a curveball in there
[13:49] puts in a monkey wrench and and God
[13:53] allows those things why there's a
[13:55] specific reason why he knows you better
[13:58] than you know yourself you think you
[14:00] know yourself and you think that you
[14:02] know the best way to go but you realize
[14:05] God knows you better than you do
[14:07] God knows you better and he understands
[14:09] you better and he knows exactly what you
[14:11] need
[14:12] amen and sometimes you know and I want
[14:16] to give this message to our younger guys
[14:20] and girls but but it's for everybody you
[14:23] know because you know we get to these
[14:28] points that that we have to realize that
[14:30] God is ultimately in control of our
[14:33] lives now we're not robots God is
[14:36] there's not pushing us through tubes or
[14:38] anything like that you still have a
[14:41] decisions that you have to make free
[14:43] moral agency I'm thankful that God gave
[14:45] us free more agency a man you decide
[14:48] Amen what you want to do but God moved
[14:51] before the foundation in the world what
[14:52] decisions you were gonna make and he
[14:54] would make a man proportioned and in in
[15:00] places Amen in situations for you to
[15:03] make that decision they meant praise God
[15:05] so
[15:08] and other questions that we ask
[15:10] ourselves is why we wonder why is it
[15:13] that the faithful suffer a Christian
[15:15] suffers but the but the but the wicked
[15:17] people out here they're they seem like
[15:19] they're does everything's going fine
[15:20] with them you know they get to do
[15:23] everything that they want their parents
[15:27] don't say anything to them they get to
[15:29] do that and and and yet Here I am I'm
[15:31] stuck and I'm I can't do everything in
[15:34] the whole world is doing
[15:37] ACF had questions like that too and he
[15:41] was a hundred years old when he wrote
[15:42] those songs amen he was an old man amen
[15:45] and then we questioned God sometimes God
[15:49] why is it that not it's going this way
[15:51] why is it that I'm why is it that this
[15:53] has happened in my life amen why is it
[15:56] that that I can't seem to get through
[15:59] this trial amen
[16:00] go through this biz setting sin in my
[16:03] life amen
[16:05] sometimes God allows a men God wants you
[16:08] to conquer your you for you to conquer
[16:10] your besetting sin amen
[16:13] or God wants you to conquer that that is
[16:15] holding you back from truly serving the
[16:17] Lord amen amen
[16:19] because again God has given us his word
[16:22] and if we look to his word amen his word
[16:25] has all the answers we think that word
[16:28] doesn't have it's just an old English
[16:30] book it speaks an old English and
[16:33] doesn't know and I can't really relate
[16:35] to it amen but if you really pay
[16:37] attention to what the word is saying
[16:38] look into the word amen
[16:40] and and and say Lord whatever that word
[16:43] says about to me what I read that's for
[16:46] me
[16:47] amen and God gives you a revelation of
[16:49] that word Amen that'll change you even
[16:52] in 2018 the word is still relevant just
[16:55] as it was written amen
[16:57] just as it was spoken before the
[16:59] foundation of the world amen it's still
[17:01] relevant today amen praise God and I'm
[17:03] thankful because there's this eternal
[17:05] word amen praise God so we're just gonna
[17:09] look here just a little bit of just a
[17:12] little bit of background of who Asaph
[17:13] was and Asaph he was a young priest from
[17:16] the tribe of Levi when David brought the
[17:19] Ark of the Covenant up to
[17:21] Jerusalem his father who was beric ayah
[17:25] was appointed the doorkeeper of the arc
[17:28] and a saif was so talented that david
[17:31] put him in charge of the music before
[17:33] the Ark of the Covenant Amen so he SF
[17:37] was a was a singer he was a musician and
[17:40] he he was a musician and a singer from a
[17:44] young man he was put in that position
[17:46] David put him in that position him and
[17:48] David were like this they meant about
[17:51] the if you look back in the history
[17:53] David loved him very much and he loved
[17:56] David a lot and he was willing to serve
[17:58] he served David Amen when David was King
[18:01] and ace F had a brother named Zechariah
[18:04] who helped him he and of course he was
[18:08] eventually murdered by Solomon's agents
[18:11] in the temple according to history
[18:13] speculation and and you can read that in
[18:16] Matthew chapter 23 verse 32 because
[18:19] Jesus says there speaking to the
[18:21] Pharisees he tells them that he says
[18:24] that a that wherefore behold I send unto
[18:27] you prophets and wise men and scribes
[18:29] and some of them you shall kill and
[18:31] crucify and some of them you shall scour
[18:34] jhin's you're in your synagogues and
[18:35] persecute them from city to city that
[18:38] upon you may come all the righteous
[18:39] blood shed upon the Earth from the blood
[18:41] of righteous Abel unto the blood of
[18:43] Zacharias son of Barachias whom you slew
[18:47] between the temple and the altar it's
[18:49] it's some people think that that
[18:50] Zechariah John the Baptist dad some
[18:54] people think that that's Zachariah a
[18:57] saps brother Amen but so nevertheless he
[19:06] was murdered whoever who was they meant
[19:09] and so Asaph he grew up seeing David
[19:14] come to his ascension as king and and
[19:17] saw the the the time that David was king
[19:21] and and in in in in in all this and saw
[19:24] when David came down as king and Solomon
[19:30] took over and he saw even the golden
[19:32] time that Solomon was was a
[19:34] was be as the king and and and he
[19:37] thought that Solomon was a you know he
[19:40] was all in that golden generation that
[19:43] the the children of Israel were and he
[19:45] was part of it he saw it and then yet he
[19:48] saw when Solomon turned to wicked gods
[19:51] to other gods back slid married ungodly
[19:57] women and and and and turned his back on
[19:59] God amen and he saw all that and yet
[20:03] during all that that he saw he had to
[20:07] keep his faith he had to keep his faith
[20:09] in God seeing his own king seeing the
[20:13] people around him turning to other gods
[20:15] and yet he still had to keep himself
[20:18] amen
[20:19] and that's just like less like today you
[20:21] know everybody seems to be turning away
[20:24] from the message everybody seems to be
[20:27] turning away from from following God and
[20:31] following Christ and all the young
[20:33] people that you know they they seem to
[20:35] turn go with the crowd and everybody
[20:38] wears this and everybody does this and
[20:41] everybody has this and everybody does
[20:43] amen and and and and people just follow
[20:48] like flies in this house we're seeing it
[20:52] because history repeats itself amen
[20:55] history repeats itself so it's not
[20:57] anything new amen
[20:58] history repeats itself and everybody
[21:01] turning amen
[21:02] everybody and you everywhere you turn
[21:04] now you you look and people are shouting
[21:07] at you and and and and in saying you
[21:09] know why do you believe such things my
[21:12] mom and dad they believe that and and I
[21:15] believed it and nothing good came out of
[21:17] it and and it's just kind of like the
[21:20] children of Israel when they were
[21:21] walking around the the the what is it
[21:26] the city Jericho and I'm like I can
[21:33] imagine you know the people up there you
[21:35] know they were probably shouting and
[21:36] screaming things at them and saying what
[21:38] are you fools thinking out here shouting
[21:42] and out here screaming and out here
[21:44] doing things ridiculous things out here
[21:47] with your long hair
[21:48] here with your pants out here with your
[21:50] you don't you do this you don't think
[21:52] you don't smoke you don't curse you
[21:54] don't you know what are you all doing
[21:59] but if the children of Israel didn't
[22:01] stick to what God had said amen they
[22:04] would not had seen those walls fall amen
[22:06] because they stuck with the word of the
[22:09] Lord they saw the promise of God be
[22:12] fulfilled in their lives the same thing
[22:14] with you and I Saints if we stick with
[22:18] the Word of God if we stick with the
[22:20] promises of God you'll see them
[22:22] fulfilled in your very in your very life
[22:24] you may not understand how or when how
[22:28] it's all going to transpire but as long
[22:31] as you stay with the word as long as you
[22:33] stay with what you're with what your mom
[22:36] and dad has brought to you ever since
[22:38] you were a little baby because let me
[22:42] tell you if your mom and dad are still
[22:43] here at church and bringing you to
[22:46] church that's a good sign that what they
[22:48] taught you from the beginning is good
[22:50] amen
[22:53] you know because that's their desire is
[22:57] to be more like God and that's the
[23:00] desire for them to be more like God then
[23:02] that's probably the desire today you
[23:03] have for you as well amen so let that
[23:08] desire not be to just observing the Lord
[23:11] just because my mommy and dad serving
[23:12] the Lord I'm serving the Lord because I
[23:14] want to serve the Lord amen
[23:16] praise God amen so in and if you read
[23:23] the Psalms of Asaph you will see how
[23:25] much his Psalms speak of the events of
[23:27] his life and times
[23:28] Psalm 73 reflects a SAVs bitterness at
[23:31] the murder of his brother and you keep
[23:33] reading all the way to Psalms chapter 82
[23:35] it's at most most of those was a SEF
[23:39] Amen so that's a little bit of Asaph and
[23:43] so he served the Lord ever since he was
[23:45] a young man and you know I was I came to
[23:52] the Lord when I was 12 years old I was
[23:55] twelve years old when when when I
[23:57] accepted salvation and this is all I've
[24:01] known since then
[24:02] before that I was a Catholic and a
[24:04] Jehovah's Witness and you probably don't
[24:09] know what that that some of you may not
[24:11] know what that is I you know some of you
[24:13] may have been Catholic Church and been
[24:15] Catholics but I was the one who would go
[24:17] over there and not to take dip might
[24:18] hand a little water and you know do this
[24:20] yeah and all that stuff I was there I
[24:23] was there with my mom praying with
[24:25] rosaries and with with things in front
[24:28] of it I saw all that statues of Virgin
[24:30] Mary's everything I was all involved
[24:33] that we'd go to the cemetery to pray
[24:37] later it was it would be like 10 o'clock
[24:39] at night praying in the cemetery and be
[24:43] my sisters in me and you know you
[24:47] wouldn't think anything of it because
[24:50] you thought that yeah that's just how
[24:51] you grew up you know but I'm thankful
[24:53] that God amen he's touched my mom and
[24:55] dad's life and you know he can't we came
[24:59] to the Lord amen so because you know you
[25:04] you're you're blind amen
[25:06] but if God doesn't open your eyes amen
[25:09] you're just uh you just keep going that
[25:11] direction amen you keep going that
[25:13] direction amen so let's look at psalms
[25:15] chapter 73 and i just want to take it
[25:19] verse by verse amen
[25:21] i felt led to go this direction tonight
[25:25] and we'll see how the Lord leads us say
[25:28] now now what I did was I took I took
[25:31] Psalm 73 and I put the King James
[25:33] Version at the top which is an italic
[25:37] and then the very simplified version of
[25:40] what that verse is saying right run
[25:42] right under it for you sometimes it's
[25:45] hard to understand the King James
[25:46] Version so let's see what let's see what
[25:49] Asaph says this godly man who served the
[25:55] Lord who was in the Lord service and
[25:58] let's see what happens to him Amen the
[26:00] verse 1 says truly God is good to Israel
[26:03] even to such as are of a clean heart so
[26:07] he's saying God is so good to Israel to
[26:09] those whose hearts are pure now I mean
[26:12] none of us here can deny that some of us
[26:15] we've
[26:15] known that God is good ever since he's
[26:17] we've been little kids God is a good God
[26:20] you know none of us can deny that but
[26:24] look what he says here verse 2 but as
[26:26] for me my feet were almost gone my steps
[26:30] had well-nigh slipped says but I almost
[26:34] slipped and lost my balance I almost
[26:37] fell into sin this man who loved the
[26:41] Lord who was in the service of the Lord
[26:44] and yet he came to a position in his
[26:46] life where he he almost slipped so good
[26:52] bad things can happen to good people
[26:55] every every every time every time we
[26:58] walk in this life amen you have these
[27:01] mind battles all the time is it worth it
[27:04] to keep going this way is it worth it to
[27:07] keep serving the Lord look I keep
[27:09] falling and doing this this this is it
[27:11] worth it to keep going that's what Satan
[27:13] wants you to do think but God wants you
[27:18] to keep going God doesn't want you to
[27:21] throw in the towel amen God wants you to
[27:24] keep going because he has something
[27:26] special for you something special
[27:27] planned out for you for I was envious at
[27:30] the foolish verse 3 when I saw the
[27:32] prosperity of the wicked in other words
[27:35] I saw that wicked people were successful
[27:38] and I became jealous of those proud
[27:40] people you know me growing up as a young
[27:44] man and I got into rap and hip-hop and
[27:47] all that kind of stuff
[27:48] and you'd see I you know I used to have
[27:51] MTV my mom and dad had MTV at the house
[27:55] music television and not mimic those
[27:57] those got those guys I'd want to dress
[28:00] just like them I'd have chains just like
[28:02] them and do all the moves while I sing
[28:04] and rap and all kinds of stuff and I was
[28:06] a dancer too and I was I was jealous of
[28:10] those people I wanted to be just like
[28:12] that yeah and it's so in us and I know
[28:18] as a younger generation younger young
[28:22] people today amen
[28:24] we want to mimic those who prosper we
[28:27] want to well they're prospering and
[28:29] they're
[28:29] so you know why can't I go that route
[28:31] they seemed like they were going fine
[28:33] why can't I go that route you see in
[28:35] your mind maybe you're not thinking that
[28:37] but I would I did you know and so that's
[28:43] what that's what and this is an older
[28:45] man thinking the same way seeing and
[28:50] remember remember the the background
[28:52] this is during the time when Solomon was
[28:55] King and he was seeing all this
[28:58] prosperity with all this wickedness yet
[29:01] taking place and him being almost pretty
[29:05] much the almost the only one who was
[29:07] really serving the Lord at the time put
[29:12] yourself in his position I saw the
[29:14] wicked were successful and I became
[29:16] jealous of those proud people verse 4
[29:19] for there are no bands in their death
[29:21] but their strength is firm they are
[29:23] healthy they don't have to struggle to
[29:25] survive your thought of that of the
[29:29] people out in the world I think might
[29:31] they prosper politicians their lies and
[29:35] there are all kinds of stuff but yet
[29:37] seem like they the rich keep getting
[29:38] richer and the poor keep getting poor it
[29:41] seems like yeah verse 5 they are not in
[29:45] trouble as other men neither are they
[29:47] plagued like other men in other words
[29:49] they don't suffer like the rest of us
[29:52] they don't have troubles like other
[29:54] people to be quite honest with you when
[29:58] I came to the Lord and I really gave my
[30:00] heart to God that's really when the
[30:02] struggle was was when they say the
[30:04] struggle was real that's when the
[30:08] struggle is real that's when it that's
[30:11] when problems came in my life back then
[30:13] you know I could do all kinds of stuff
[30:15] and smoke weed and use drugs and alcohol
[30:18] and all that kind of stuff it wouldn't
[30:20] bother me one bit but then when I came
[30:23] to the Lord when you really really give
[30:26] your heart to God and you really turn
[30:28] yourself to him amen and looking and
[30:31] looking into his word and really want to
[30:33] know more about his will for your life
[30:35] that's one Satan a man he gets he gets
[30:39] he gets to working I said he doesn't
[30:42] want you to be in the
[30:44] in that position that he's in they meant
[30:46] that got that God in the same image as
[30:48] Christ they meant verse 6 therefore
[30:51] pride compasseth them about as a chain
[30:55] violence covers them as a garment in
[30:58] other words so they are proud and
[31:00] hateful this is as easy to see as the
[31:02] jewels and fancy clothes they wear and
[31:10] just because somebody is wearing fancy
[31:13] jewels and fancy clothes out in the
[31:14] world and this is what the hip-hop world
[31:16] shows us that you have to wear fancy
[31:20] clothes and fancy jewels and and fancy
[31:23] shoes and $200 pair of sneakers in order
[31:27] to be you know cool but you look at what
[31:36] direction they're going they think that
[31:38] that's what a Millionaire is and really
[31:41] a Millionaire somebody doesn't really
[31:44] out there displaying their wealth really
[31:48] the one who really has money is not one
[31:50] out there showing showing their wealth
[31:51] throwing their bling and showing it that
[31:53] it's not they're very quiet about their
[31:56] wealth that's the true millionaire right
[31:58] there but the Hollywood the way
[32:00] Hollywood portrays millionaires is there
[32:02] out riding these expensive Hummers and
[32:04] all these expensive cars and all these
[32:07] things and wearing all these necklaces
[32:09] chains and the girls are wearing all
[32:11] these tight clothes and all these you
[32:13] know high heels down the hill and all
[32:16] kinds of stuff like that and think that
[32:17] they got so much money I wish I had that
[32:19] type of money I'm getting me something
[32:21] like that you realize that those people
[32:24] a lot of them they come to not they lose
[32:27] their wealth the majority of them
[32:29] because they don't know how to handle
[32:30] this right that's not how you handle
[32:32] wealth if God's blessed you with wealth
[32:34] Amen God knows that you can handle it
[32:36] therefore he's blessed you with Amen
[32:39] verse 7 their eyes stand out with
[32:42] fatness they have more than heart could
[32:44] wish if they see something they like
[32:47] they go and take it they do whatever
[32:49] they want that's the world nothing
[32:53] bothers them nothing bothers them
[32:56] they are corrupt and speak wickedly
[32:58] concerning oppression they speak loft
[33:01] elite they make fun of others and say
[33:03] cruel things about them and their pride
[33:06] they make plans to hurt people amen
[33:09] you know I was reading I was reading the
[33:16] other day about the the things that were
[33:22] said when the Titanic was built and they
[33:25] said it was an employee who was part of
[33:29] the you know ocean liners and things
[33:31] like that at the time they said this
[33:32] Titanic God couldn't even sink it and it
[33:38] was put in and it was recorded in the
[33:39] papers where they said they said that
[33:41] and look what happened to the Titanic
[33:46] yeah I believe it was Nixon I believe he
[33:49] said he said when man went up to the
[33:52] moon and and Nixon said this is the best
[33:55] thing has ever happened since the
[33:56] creation of God
[34:00] you know just lofty things and look look
[34:02] at the way Nixon went right okay his
[34:05] life like the way the Titanic went and
[34:08] then cruise ship I think a war it was
[34:10] white either this Russian spaceman in
[34:12] 1961 or Khrushchev said I went up and
[34:15] dissipated that that spaceman went up to
[34:18] space and he didn't see God up there and
[34:24] all those things all those people are
[34:26] they're not there they're not you know
[34:28] in memory and and your memory anymore
[34:30] you know amen they say lofty things but
[34:34] those that those people they go they
[34:36] come to not amen oh yeah verse 9 they
[34:41] set their mouth against the heavens and
[34:43] their tongue walketh through the earth
[34:45] they think they are gods they think that
[34:48] that they are the rulers of the earth
[34:51] when the rulers of the earth are our I
[34:55] believe rulers or the other standing
[34:57] right here I believe that without my
[35:00] heart you and I Amen we were this is the
[35:04] Dominion that God gave to you and me
[35:06] a man in the world has no clue
[35:09] whatsoever they think it's the President
[35:12] of Russia who owns they think it's the
[35:15] president of the United States they
[35:17] think that all these glamorous people
[35:20] they're the ones who own the earth when
[35:22] in actuality it belongs to you and I
[35:26] remember what we talked about that
[35:28] Kingdom that Kingdom right now is being
[35:31] set at this very moment in our hearts
[35:35] right now amen
[35:36] in order for us to possess it physically
[35:39] amen praise God verse 10 there for his
[35:44] people return hither and waters of a
[35:46] full cup or rung out to them even God's
[35:48] people turn to them and do what they say
[35:51] my sometimes we get so we we think we
[35:59] need we just need to mimic what
[36:01] Hollywood is telling us or what well
[36:04] politician is saying okay you know
[36:07] sometimes I just can't believe how how
[36:10] incredibly how much people get into
[36:13] politics and we're supposed to be
[36:14] Christians you know when you should know
[36:19] better than that you should know very
[36:25] very far in between that somebody's
[36:28] gonna get up there that's gonna do
[36:29] really what the people want them to do
[36:33] probably very few and and and in the
[36:37] ones that probably would really gonna do
[36:40] what they promised they we're gonna do
[36:41] they never get up there they've never
[36:45] gotten up there as president and has
[36:48] this you know they'll just never get up
[36:50] there so why get into politics and get
[36:53] it and get so consumed by these things
[36:55] it's so consumed by by the trends of
[36:59] this life you know by the by the
[37:03] Hollywood trends that you know you have
[37:06] to dress this way in order to to look
[37:12] cool and and and show that you got
[37:16] something you know a man
[37:20] you know the way you portray yourself on
[37:22] the outside is shows a lot what you are
[37:24] on the inside yeah shows what's going on
[37:31] on the inside right so if you want if
[37:34] you know but then of course many times
[37:37] that that's not the case either you know
[37:40] a lot of times you can dress nicely and
[37:42] you can portray yourself on the outside
[37:43] a certain way but you'd be corrupt
[37:45] totally corrupt on the inside amen
[37:49] that's what we need to hold to God amen
[37:51] and they say how does God know and is
[37:54] there knowledge in the Most High those
[37:57] evil people say God does not know what
[38:00] we are doing God knows God most high
[38:02] does not know behold these are the
[38:07] ungodly who prosper in the world not the
[38:11] word the world they increase in riches
[38:15] not spiritual riches physical riches
[38:18] yeah that won't save your soul those
[38:21] proud people are wicked but they are
[38:23] rich and getting richer look what he
[38:26] says look what Asaph says this godly
[38:29] spiritual man in verse 13 verily I have
[38:32] cleansed my heart in vain and washed my
[38:35] hands in innocency in other words
[38:38] clearly then I gain nothing by keeping
[38:41] my thoughts pure what good is it to keep
[38:44] myself from sin hey he came to this
[38:49] point where he was seeing the wicked
[38:51] doing all of this everybody was leaving
[38:52] the message everybody was was was
[38:56] following after the world and living and
[38:58] looking like the world what point is it
[39:01] to keep myself pure my thoughts pure and
[39:05] to keep myself from sin this man came to
[39:10] this point to think about this how much
[39:14] how much you know our young younger
[39:18] generation Amen when they see all this
[39:20] that's going on into high god Satan's
[39:23] constantly bombarding them with thoughts
[39:25] bombarding you with thoughts you don't
[39:29] have to be 15 or 16 amen
[39:32] I'm 38 I'm bombarded with these thoughts
[39:34] you know why is it you know what's the
[39:41] point of serving the Lord you know I
[39:43] don't see nothing going on yeah I don't
[39:45] see nothing that you know ya better
[39:47] believe that that's Satan talking to you
[39:49] that ain't God that's Satan talking
[39:53] it's definitely Satan amen for all the
[39:58] day long have I been played chaste and
[40:02] every morning God I suffer all day long
[40:05] and you punished me every morning Lord
[40:10] the more I serve you the more I get down
[40:12] to pray the more I go to church the more
[40:15] I give myself to you in every shape form
[40:18] and every aspect every time I come home
[40:21] Airy there's something broken in the
[40:24] house my kid is sick my my family is
[40:28] being torn apart somebody's about to die
[40:33] but God knows you better than you know
[40:36] yourself God knows exactly what you need
[40:39] amen because my trial is not brother
[40:42] Dale's trial right right right
[40:45] God knows brother Dale God knows why he
[40:47] needs a man in order to form and mold
[40:49] him God knows what Esther needs in order
[40:51] to mold her your trial is not the same
[40:54] as nihilus dollars not gonna go maybe
[40:56] the same thing you you go through amen
[40:59] because God knows what she needs to go
[41:01] through in order for her to become like
[41:02] Jesus Christ amen
[41:04] same thing with with me amen God knows
[41:07] me I'm glad that he knows me amen and he
[41:10] knows you they meant verse 15 if I say I
[41:15] will speak thus behold I should defend
[41:17] against the generation of thy children
[41:18] huh I wanted to tell others these things
[41:21] but that would have made me a traitor to
[41:23] your people in other words a salve he
[41:26] wanted to just let the people know I'm
[41:28] ready to give up I'm ready to stop
[41:31] serving God I'm ready to stop doing what
[41:33] I'm supposed to be doing but he didn't
[41:35] want to be considered a traitor to the
[41:37] people apparently there was people who
[41:40] were looking up to him amen there's
[41:43] people that look up to you and I say
[41:45] amen for us to be dealing with the
[41:48] things of the world and they'll be
[41:50] dealing with with the things of you are
[41:52] needed in this hour whether you think
[41:55] you're not amen
[41:57] you're very special and you're needed
[41:59] amen and when one of you is not here
[42:01] amen
[42:01] you're missed you're missed and we're
[42:06] wondering are you okay
[42:07] especially are you okay spiritually amen
[42:11] you know mm-hmm verse 16 when I thought
[42:16] to know this it was too painful for me
[42:19] in other words I tried hard to
[42:22] understand all this but it was too hard
[42:24] for me it's hard for us same entity to
[42:28] think the position that we are at at the
[42:30] very at this moment of our lives I don't
[42:33] know what you're going through I don't
[42:36] know maybe it's something difficult that
[42:37] you're going through right now
[42:38] but God knows all about it right and you
[42:42] don't have to you don't have to explain
[42:45] every single thing that goes on in your
[42:47] life
[42:48] because if he did if you could explain
[42:51] everything then there was the point of
[42:52] having faith what's the point of having
[42:55] faith in God and trusting him if you can
[42:58] explain everything because if you can
[43:00] explain everything and then that puts
[43:02] you on the verge of saying that I know I
[43:04] know more than God and I don't need to
[43:05] serve Him and you won't and you want and
[43:08] you won't depend on him amen
[43:12] in verse 10 and verse 17 and now now
[43:16] look at look at a saps turning point he
[43:20] says until I went into the sanctuary of
[43:22] God then then I understood I understood
[43:28] in their end
[43:30] in other words but dang God I went to
[43:32] your temple and I understood what will
[43:35] happen to the wicked amen and it reminds
[43:39] me a lot of the of the prodigal son
[43:41] you know when he was doing everything he
[43:44] left home and it was spending all the
[43:46] money and living righteously and all
[43:48] kinds of stuff but it wasn't until he
[43:51] came to himself until he realized wait a
[43:54] second
[43:55] this is not where I'm supposed to be
[43:57] amen it wasn't until a SEF came to that
[44:01] point he went into the sanctuary of God
[44:04] now what is the sanctuary of God amen
[44:07] his word is a sanctuary man he is the
[44:10] sanctuary of God amen
[44:12] he is our sanctuary and if you keep
[44:14] going keep going up we're gonna read
[44:16] some verses here look what Isaiah 8:14
[44:21] says and he shall be for a sanctuary
[44:23] amen
[44:25] speaking of Jesus Christ but for a stone
[44:27] of stumbling and for a rock of offense
[44:29] to both the house of Israel for a gene
[44:32] and for a snare to the inhabitants of
[44:34] Jerusalem amen he is our sanctuary
[44:37] Saints where else could we go but to the
[44:40] Lord you know we're going this direction
[44:43] we're thinking a certain way but then
[44:45] when we when we humble ourselves and we
[44:49] look to the word and we see and we allow
[44:51] the word to help us then it can change
[44:54] our thinking then it can change our
[44:58] thinking but if you're haughty if you're
[45:00] if you're if you don't want anything of
[45:02] God if you think you can make it on your
[45:05] own if you think you at your own opinion
[45:08] matters very highly over everybody
[45:12] else's you won't get anywhere with God
[45:14] with that that type of attitude
[45:16] Philippians 4 verse 7 says and the peace
[45:20] of God which passeth all understanding
[45:22] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[45:25] Christ Jesus amen he's the one who can
[45:32] shape and clear our thoughts and put us
[45:36] in the right thinking amen through
[45:38] Christ Jesus does it doesn't say you
[45:41] doesn't say the president doesn't say
[45:45] you know anybody anybody else through
[45:48] Christ Jesus is the way he shall keep
[45:50] your hearts and minds and we can agree
[45:54] that a SEF was going through a
[45:55] tumultuous time not just physically he
[46:00] was seeing physical disaster and
[46:02] destruction around him but he was seeing
[46:04] it spiritually in his life amen he
[46:07] didn't he didn't understand why it was
[46:09] all happening amen
[46:10] let's go to the next verse says in
[46:13] Hebrews 6 verse 17 says wearing God
[46:16] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[46:18] heirs of promise the immutability of his
[46:20] counsel confirmed it by an oath that by
[46:24] two immutable things in which it was
[46:26] impossible for God to lie we might have
[46:28] a strong consolation who have fled for
[46:33] refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[46:36] before us
[46:37] I like this which hope we have as an
[46:41] anchor of the soul amen
[46:44] both sure and steadfast and which
[46:47] entereth into that within the veil amen
[46:52] praise God a couple of weeks ago I was
[46:57] doing a Sunday School lesson and I
[46:59] talked about the going into the inner
[47:02] veil right
[47:04] we know that at that time in the Old
[47:08] Testament it was only the high priest
[47:12] could go in there at a certain time of
[47:14] the year right only once a once a year
[47:17] now it's a it's a sin or it's if you
[47:22] don't go in there it's it's death well
[47:25] back then if anybody else besides the
[47:27] high priest went in there it was death
[47:29] now if you don't go in there it's death
[47:32] to you amen
[47:34] as death if you don't go in there now
[47:36] there is no physical place just because
[47:40] you come to church doesn't mean that
[47:42] that will save you just because you sit
[47:44] here and listen to the word that doesn't
[47:46] save you if you don't believe that word
[47:50] receive and believe that word but you by
[47:53] you just warming a bench that doesn't
[47:55] save you that doesn't give you brownie
[47:58] points with God doesn't put a little
[48:03] star you know with God Amen just because
[48:06] you come to church or you read one verse
[48:10] today in the Bible and prayed for three
[48:13] minutes
[48:14] this doesn't give you any brownie points
[48:16] whatsoever Amen right if you didn't
[48:19] totally holy do do it Amen with all of
[48:22] your heart
[48:24] amen cuz God knows your heart amen
[48:27] but we as the high priest would go in
[48:31] there and he and he would go in there
[48:33] with the blood of the sacrifice to
[48:36] sprinkle upon the mercy seat amen
[48:38] and when he would go in there there was
[48:41] the rod of Aaron an old dry rod there
[48:46] outside of the outside of that
[48:49] tabernacle outside of that holy of
[48:51] Holy's it would dry up in Aaron's hand
[48:55] it was dry it was it was proudly sticker
[48:58] II you know it was it was gone it was
[49:01] rotting probably but when it got into
[49:05] the Holy of Holies amen it was reviving
[49:08] again it was it was it was even budding
[49:12] the Bible says and it was an attached to
[49:15] any tree whatsoever
[49:19] although there was a tree there is a
[49:24] tree in there amen the tree of life
[49:28] that's the reason why it was budding and
[49:31] then you also had a man do what they say
[49:33] we have hid us here can we use this but
[49:36] I was might be too heavy let's see so
[49:46] here's the things that we're in there
[49:49] you had Aaron's rod that budded right
[49:53] remember this thing was not was in a
[49:56] place where it wasn't even attached to a
[49:58] tree and yet leaves were coming out of
[50:01] it
[50:01] that's look what happens when you're
[50:05] inside the inner veil and then you had
[50:08] the manna that was gathered the original
[50:13] manner that fell were the first time
[50:17] when the manna fell from heaven
[50:18] Moses was commanded to go get some of
[50:21] that mana and be put inside the
[50:23] tabernacle right and that manna with the
[50:27] if the children of Israel when they
[50:29] would eat that manna they would have to
[50:31] eat of it that morning and then by the
[50:35] evening time it was already rotting
[50:37] so they have to dispose of it by the
[50:39] evening time but yet this original
[50:41] manner which represents the Word of God
[50:43] was consistently fresh inside the
[50:48] interval amen it never rotted it never
[50:53] would would would be bad so when the
[50:55] high priest would go in there when the
[50:57] high priest would go in there he could
[50:59] always take a little portion of that and
[51:00] it's taste just as good as it tasted the
[51:04] first day it felt right amen
[51:08] and that's the same thing a men with
[51:10] with with us to you on the outside
[51:16] that Tabernacle looks like something
[51:18] that there's just scary and something
[51:20] that you know I don't want to go in
[51:22] there but when you really taste of the
[51:25] good word of God when you're really
[51:26] coming to the into the presence of God
[51:28] when you come to yourself just like a
[51:30] SEF did amen and come to his sanctuary
[51:34] because that's what the sanctuary of God
[51:36] represents Amen - holy of Holy's right
[51:39] spiritually when you really come in and
[51:42] taste of this good word of God you'll
[51:44] continue I mean there's nothing that
[51:46] will hold you back amen
[51:48] you won't want to turn back to the world
[51:50] you wouldn't want to turn back to the
[51:52] fashions of the world you don't want to
[51:55] turn back to the music of the world into
[51:57] the movies of the world and to the
[51:59] ungodly things that young people do
[52:01] today out in the world
[52:03] tattoos and nollies haircuts and all
[52:07] these things that they get in they look
[52:10] just like just like the world and we
[52:14] bring in those things in our life you'll
[52:18] never want to when you're really Amen
[52:22] experienced and tasted of the good Word
[52:24] of God
[52:24] amen of the good man of God but you have
[52:30] to dip you have to dip Amen you have you
[52:32] have to go in there and taste it and eat
[52:35] it for yourself God it's not gonna
[52:38] force-feed you and say here you eat this

[53:14] Christ he he took care of he was the
[53:17] ultimate high priest right took care of
[53:19] it a man for once and it's done
[53:22] Amen now he wants you to come amen

[53:59] a husband if that's your desire God
[54:02] already has it right there ready for you

[54:16] you both join you'll know it's perfect
[54:19] then you'll know it because both of you
[54:22] are in the word you know yesterday

[54:30] roofer guys come to our house they were
[54:32] trying to sell us you know a new roof
[54:34] and things like that and there was these
[54:36] young guys one was like 23 and the other
[54:38] was 24 and they found that I was a
[54:41] minister and and and and everything and
[54:44] one of them was getting married getting
[54:45] married in like two months the 24 year
[54:47] old and he said oh man that's great
[54:50] that's awesome you know that you you

[54:54] hope we told them and so right so we got
[54:59] to doing what we were supposed to do
[55:00] there with the thing and then the dura
[55:02] gantry leaving he told me he said can
[55:04] you
[55:04] give me some advice what I can you know
[55:07] some marriage advice you know and I
[55:11] could tell that he was real sincere I
[55:13] really enjoyed talking with him and I
[55:15] gave him some advice I told him let me
[55:18] tell you the first things first when
[55:21] it's it's not you and her getting
[55:24] married
[55:25] she has Christ in her life and you have
[55:27] Christ in her life than it should be
[55:29] three people hid in their they meant in
[55:31] that relationship praise God because
[55:35] then the rest of it will take care of
[55:37] itself when you as the husband amen when
[55:41] the when the husband you as the head
[55:43] when you are in your position then
[55:45] she'll be in her position amen things
[55:48] will fall in line and he's he told me he
[55:52] said and I said you know sacrifice is a
[55:55] very important thing you know and he
[55:58] said well what do you mean he said do
[56:00] you mean like I can't go out with my
[56:01] friends anymore and things like that oh
[56:03] that's gonna stop so let me tell you
[56:07] that's gonna stop but I said let me also
[56:09] tell you this that if you are the right
[56:12] head and you put Christ in your life
[56:14] properly you give her the time that she
[56:17] needs she will live give you the time
[56:19] that you need that's just how it works
[56:23] she'll give she'll know what you need
[56:25] and she'll she'll freely gladly give it
[56:28] if you give her a man because she is the
[56:30] Bible says the Bible says husband's love
[56:33] your wives right but then it says but
[56:37] wives respect your husbands why doesn't
[56:41] it say wives love your husband's it's
[56:44] because wives need to be loved they want
[56:48] to feel love they want you to tell them
[56:51] I love you honey you're the you're the
[56:53] best best wife ever you're the best cook
[56:56] ever you you're you fulfill my life they
[56:59] love hearing those things but a husband
[57:01] doesn't really like to hear those things
[57:03] well he likes to have as his ego rug he
[57:08] loves for you to tell him to for you as
[57:11] the wife tell him honey I'm so glad the
[57:14] way you provide for the family and look
[57:17] how you fixed our
[57:18] shower you did this for me and and I
[57:21] appreciate how you sit down and you play
[57:24] with the children and you're so you're
[57:26] so wonderful like that and you know what
[57:28] that makes the husband feel like home I
[57:30] want to keep doing some more of that
[57:31] yeah you see that's how it works that's
[57:34] how a marriage should work that's why
[57:36] the Bible says husband's love your wives
[57:38] and then husbands risk wives respect
[57:42] your husband because a husband wants
[57:45] respect unnecessarily want lovey dovey
[57:47] type stuff although he should be open to
[57:50] that but what a husband really wants is
[57:55] respect he wants you to respect him amen
[57:58] I don't know how I got into that
[57:59] somebody must have needed it amen
[58:03] praise God so let's go to the let's go -
[58:08] is there another verse after this
[58:10] Pretenders all right so we're back to
[58:13] Psalms 37 hard let's finish up here this
[58:18] is what God gave me so you you you all
[58:21] you all I hope you I hope you enjoy oh
[58:24] he's God surely verse 18 surely thou did
[58:29] it set them in Slippery places now
[58:31] Kassadin down into destruction in other
[58:34] words clearly you have put them in
[58:35] danger you make it easy for them to fall
[58:38] and be destroyed so now now that Asaph
[58:41] was in the sanctuary of God right was in
[58:44] was in in in the word in other words
[58:47] right in the in the presence of God
[58:51] doing what he was supposed to do really
[58:53] in love with God back to himself again
[58:55] amen now God was showing him things that
[58:59] the wicked out here they're they're
[59:02] gonna keep doing they're gonna the
[59:03] wicked still be wicked the the bad
[59:06] people are still gonna be bad the the
[59:08] rich are gonna get richer they're gonna
[59:10] prosper things all that is gonna happen
[59:13] amen but what about you Amen but you
[59:18] don't have to worry about that Amen you
[59:21] what you need to worry about is what God
[59:23] is your relationship between you and God
[59:25] amen verse 19 how are they brought into
[59:29] desolation as in moment they are utterly
[59:31] canoe
[59:32] singing with tears trouble can come
[59:33] suddenly and they will be ruined
[59:35] terrible things can happen to them and
[59:37] they will be finished
[59:38] all these people out here the
[59:40] politicians the the the Hollywood they
[59:44] all a man can be consumed at any moment
[59:46] amen especially when they don't have God
[59:49] in their life amen the sports stars all
[59:52] these these people they're all temporary
[59:55] and just in five years from now they'll
[59:57] be all 10 years from now they're old and
[59:59] you probably may not even know anything
[1:00:01] about them anymore
[1:00:02] retired and all kinds of stuff you know
[1:00:04] like that you know we thought that
[1:00:08] Michael Jordan when he was put in the
[1:00:09] 1980s I used to love I love the
[1:00:12] basketball and and we thought man nobody
[1:00:15] could could beat him and nobody and now
[1:00:18] when I look at him giving interviews and
[1:00:20] stuff like that he's old and getting old
[1:00:22] and wrinkled and that's the same person
[1:00:27] you know we think all these are great
[1:00:30] you know and know they'll know they're
[1:00:31] invincible but they're gonna get old
[1:00:33] just like just like all of us are as a
[1:00:38] dream when one awake is so oh Lord when
[1:00:41] thou wakest thou shalt despise their
[1:00:43] image then they will be like a dream
[1:00:46] that we forget when we wake up you will
[1:00:50] make them disappear like the monsters in
[1:00:52] our dreams I'm one that I don't hardly
[1:00:56] dream but when I do dream something it's
[1:00:59] dumb that's my wife and I tell my wife
[1:01:08] it's dumb dreams and but I faint not
[1:01:10] forget him you know I forget him
[1:01:13] that's how are these people out in this
[1:01:16] world they are there they're up up here
[1:01:20] for a little while and then all of a
[1:01:21] sudden you'll never hear anything about
[1:01:23] them again what about the people that
[1:01:25] were brother Terrence in your time you
[1:01:28] know and where are they at now the music
[1:01:30] that you maybe you used to listen to
[1:01:32] where they at now you know same thing
[1:01:36] with the people today Amen but how how
[1:01:39] awesome it is that God is steadfast and
[1:01:42] you keep God and you start with God at
[1:01:44] one point and
[1:01:46] is the same a man in 1960 he was God and
[1:01:49] then in 1970 he was God in 1980 and 1990
[1:01:53] 2000 2010 2018 he's still got a man he's
[1:01:58] never changed and he never gets old
[1:02:01] and he's here ready to fulfill your need
[1:02:03] amen that's that's who I want to look up
[1:02:06] to that's my hero
[1:02:09] amen thus my heart was grieved and I was
[1:02:13] pricked in my rains I was so foolish I
[1:02:15] thought about such people and became
[1:02:18] upset when you really have God in your
[1:02:20] life this is what you're gonna think
[1:02:21] about the world you're so foolish
[1:02:24] thinking that this that my current
[1:02:28] estate my current things that I'm going
[1:02:31] through in my life it's it's you know
[1:02:35] five years down the road you really like
[1:02:36] that I was crying because of that I was
[1:02:43] and you kind of look back and use like
[1:02:45] God you put me through that position
[1:02:47] because I am where I am now because of
[1:02:49] that yeah and I thank you for that so
[1:02:53] foolish was I and ignorant I was a I was
[1:02:57] as a beast before you before thee God I
[1:02:59] was upset and angry with you I acted
[1:03:02] like a senseless animal how many of us
[1:03:05] act like that things don't go our way we
[1:03:09] get so mopey and so sad and so depressed
[1:03:13] and so feel like though we're carrying
[1:03:16] the whole world on our shoulders when in
[1:03:19] reality and then take God by surprise
[1:03:25] God knew that before the foundation of
[1:03:27] the world you just had to go through
[1:03:30] that because God has a better end for
[1:03:33] you nevertheless I'm continually with
[1:03:41] thee thou has holdin me by my right hand
[1:03:45] but I am always with you you hold my
[1:03:47] hand amen and he said he said that he'll
[1:03:54] be with us not just with us but even in
[1:03:56] amen
[1:03:59] and this is the Old Testament right how
[1:04:02] much more in this hour when the when the
[1:04:05] blood has already been applied grace has
[1:04:08] already come amen
[1:04:10] how much more is how much greater in
[1:04:12] this hour
[1:04:13] thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and
[1:04:16] afterward receive me to glory you lead
[1:04:19] me and give me good advice and later you
[1:04:22] will lead me to glory amen you received
[1:04:26] that advice amen as children you receive
[1:04:31] that good advice through your home your
[1:04:35] parents if your parents are serving the
[1:04:37] Lord and when you come to church when
[1:04:41] you listen to the messages you receive
[1:04:44] that good advice and what are you but
[1:04:46] what the thing is what are you doing
[1:04:48] with that advice amen because that
[1:04:51] advice will lead you to glory man if you
[1:04:56] say uh I'll just do it later and it
[1:05:00] would be leading to the same place that
[1:05:02] the wicked are being led to amen whom
[1:05:08] have I in heaven but thee and there is
[1:05:10] none upon earth that I desire beside
[1:05:13] thee in having God I have only you and
[1:05:17] if I am with you what on earth could I
[1:05:19] want amen what on earth could you want
[1:05:23] more than God amen there's nothing wrong
[1:05:28] with with dressing nice there's nothing
[1:05:32] wrong with wearing good you know nice
[1:05:35] pair of sneakers and there's nothing
[1:05:37] wrong with with having nice things you
[1:05:40] know nothing wrong with that it's your
[1:05:43] intention behind it
[1:05:44] amen it's their intention behind it you
[1:05:49] know I I sometimes people think you know
[1:05:54] in order for you to look humble you have
[1:05:56] to you have to look ragged I don't
[1:06:00] believe in that I don't believe in that

[1:06:06] come to the house of God you look you
[1:06:09] look your best you know
[1:06:11] I believe that you give God the best
[1:06:15] that you that you have and if overalls
[1:06:18] and and the t-shirt is all you have well
[1:06:20] then then you just give him that

[1:06:32] of God it's just any old way we dress up
[1:06:36] so nicely to two of the Valentine's
[1:06:39] banquet and that's the only time I see
[1:06:40] you dressed nice you know and I know
[1:06:49] that you can wear you can you get you
[1:06:51] can alright I'll get off of that 26 my
[1:07:01] flesh and my heart fella but God is the
[1:07:03] strength of my heart and my portion
[1:07:06] forever may be my mind and body will
[1:07:09] become weak but God is my source of
[1:07:11] strength he is mine forever hey man this
[1:07:15] is the this is this is what Asaph came
[1:07:18] to amen
[1:07:19] when he came into the sanctuary of God
[1:07:21] and gave himself to God and gave himself
[1:07:24] to look into what God really wanted to
[1:07:26] tell him amen and stopped looking at the
[1:07:29] things on the outside this is the things
[1:07:32] that he was seen for lo day that are far
[1:07:34] from thee shall perish thou has
[1:07:36] destroyed all them that go a horn from
[1:07:38] thee God people who leave you will be
[1:07:40] lost you will destroy all who are not
[1:07:43] faithful to you but it is good for me to
[1:07:45] draw near to God I have put my trust in
[1:07:48] the Lord God that I may declare all thy
[1:07:51] works as for me all I need is to be
[1:07:55] close to God amen
[1:07:57] I have made the Lord God my place of
[1:07:59] safety and God I will tell about all
[1:08:03] that you have done amen praise God
[1:08:07] that's what happens when you go into
[1:08:09] that inner veil spiritually you know and
[1:08:14] you get in the word amen you fall in
[1:08:20] love with God
[1:08:22] amen God will reveal things to that you
[1:08:27] would not have no need otherwise they
[1:08:28] met praise God
[1:08:30] amen so with Asaph amen and we're gonna
[1:08:35] read a couple of scriptures here cuz see
[1:08:36] you see
[1:08:36] Asaph he was a godly man that was prone
[1:08:40] to backsliding right
[1:08:43] he almost back slid that's what the
[1:08:46] Bible says amen no but but look what
[1:08:49] brother Branham says here amen he says
[1:08:54] in questions and answers he says in 1962
[1:08:58] backslidings not lost I want somebody to
[1:09:02] tell me where backslidings lost and
[1:09:04] proved it to improve it to the Bible
[1:09:08] backsliders not lost he's just out of
[1:09:10] fellowship amen Israel back slid but
[1:09:14] they never lost their covenant they lost
[1:09:17] their praises and joy David lost the joy
[1:09:21] of his salvation when he took bets Sheva
[1:09:24] Uriah's wife but he never lost his
[1:09:27] salvation
[1:09:28] he never said restored to me my
[1:09:31] salvation
[1:09:31] he said restored to me the joy of my
[1:09:34] salvation that's what David what David
[1:09:39] said Amen so you know young people we US
[1:09:44] adults you know we we were constantly
[1:09:48] bombarded with thoughts from Satan
[1:09:51] constantly and he's always constantly
[1:09:53] condemning us and you got to remember
[1:09:55] that every time he talks he's lying you
[1:09:57] know he's always lying he's a liar from
[1:10:01] the beginning so there the Bible says
[1:10:05] there is now no condemnation to them
[1:10:07] that are in Christ Jesus so if you are
[1:10:10] in Christ Jesus in that interval right
[1:10:14] you're in Christ in that word Amen
[1:10:17] feeding off that good word amen praise
[1:10:21] God there's no condemnation right amen
[1:10:24] no condemnation for the believer so you
[1:10:28] can just brush it away and say Satan I
[1:10:30] won't listen to that I'm below I'm
[1:10:32] serving the Lord amen
[1:10:34] and you know sometimes we we all may
[1:10:39] come to a point where you've done wrong
[1:10:40] we did wrong things we fail God
[1:10:43] and sometimes we do it deliberately and
[1:10:48] that's called iniquity amen
[1:10:52] when we fail to do what we know we need
[1:10:54] to do or we don't do what we know we
[1:10:56] should do it
[1:10:57] that's called iniquity a not falling
[1:11:01] into that myself I've gotten to places
[1:11:04] like that in my life but that has
[1:11:07] nothing to do with what God started in
[1:11:09] my soul amen because something or
[1:11:13] something within me says God you that
[1:11:15] began a good work in me will the ended
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:18] this has nothing to do with me this
[1:11:21] believing your word amen
[1:11:22] I love you Lord and all you got to do is
[1:11:24] get back up and repent repent repent to
[1:11:29] the one that maybe you've wronged and
[1:11:30] move on there's as easy as that but we
[1:11:35] make it so difficult sometimes we make
[1:11:38] it like it's this long drawn-out process
[1:11:40] amen and all it is is just go ask
[1:11:43] forgiveness to the one you've wronged
[1:11:45] if you've wronged somebody or and then
[1:11:48] ask God to forgive you and that's it and
[1:11:50] in faith just leave it there amen praise
[1:11:55] God
[1:11:56] well Bram says in in 1954 questions and
[1:11:59] answers but I'm backsliding remember you
[1:12:01] backslide every day Wow
[1:12:04] there's no way at all for you to keep
[1:12:07] out of it all right
[1:12:09] but you backslide to the people and to
[1:12:12] the people in the church but not before
[1:12:13] God see see to the people at the church
[1:12:16] you might be a backslider right but to
[1:12:19] God amen he sees you as through the
[1:12:22] blood amen if you're his son and
[1:12:24] daughter you backslide on Christ but you
[1:12:26] don't you don't own God because if you
[1:12:29] when you sin you're gone but you're
[1:12:31] constantly failing Paul had to die every
[1:12:34] day is that right
[1:12:36] he had to die every day repent every day
[1:12:38] and just constantly repenting all the
[1:12:40] time see and if Paul had to do that then
[1:12:43] I'm going to have to as well amen
[1:12:46] my brother Bram said I'm gonna have to
[1:12:48] that means he had to do it to mmm you'll
[1:12:55] make in Hebrews chapter 6 1957 brother
[1:12:58] Brent says you'll make mistakes you'll
[1:12:59] fall you'll willfully do wrong you'll go
[1:13:03] out sometime and do things that don't
[1:13:05] mean that you're lost amen that means
[1:13:09] that you're going to get correction
[1:13:11] that's what that means you know when I
[1:13:17] was out in the world and I was you know
[1:13:19] doing the things of the world I knew
[1:13:21] better
[1:13:23] my mom raised me different and raised me
[1:13:26] better and you're not happy you're not
[1:13:31] totally happy in that life amen
[1:13:34] you're out here with the can of beer in
[1:13:36] your hand and you're you're like I know
[1:13:39] I shouldn't be doing this
[1:13:40] but to the world they don't think that
[1:13:42] the one that God has not touched their
[1:13:45] soul amen they don't think that that
[1:13:47] that can of beer they're holding and
[1:13:49] doing the things that they're doing
[1:13:50] that's all right you know but somebody
[1:13:53] who God has if God's really touched you
[1:13:55] your life amen God has really spoken to
[1:13:57] you my god is really dealing with you
[1:13:59] amen you won't be the same if you out
[1:14:01] dilly dallying with the things of the
[1:14:03] world it'll be different then amen
[1:14:07] my little boy my little boy lots of
[1:14:09] times my children will do things yours
[1:14:11] dust2
[1:14:12] that you they they know that that that's
[1:14:15] against you your rules and they know
[1:14:18] what to expect when they do it they're
[1:14:20] going to get a whipping for it sometimes
[1:14:22] a good one but it's still your child
[1:14:25] certainly amen
[1:14:26] it's impossible for that man to ever be
[1:14:29] gone again that's once been born of
[1:14:32] eternal life God's not an Indian giver
[1:14:36] amen he died here with my words and
[1:14:40] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:14:41] everlasting life and shall never come to
[1:14:43] the judgment but passed from death unto
[1:14:45] life and I'll raise him up in the last
[1:14:47] days that's God's promise amen
[1:14:52] you see a true born-again believer is
[1:14:55] gonna if he fails god he's gonna feel
[1:14:58] bad about what he's done
[1:14:59] but if you don't feel anything that I've
[1:15:02] kind of doubt you've been born again
[1:15:04] right that's where it all it all
[1:15:06] basically boils down to hey man cuz
[1:15:09] we're gonna make mistakes as Christians
[1:15:11] we're gonna fail amen
[1:15:13] but if you don't do something about that
[1:15:15] right away or if something's not tugging
[1:15:17] as I listened that wasn't right then you
[1:15:21] have to have to think about yourself am
[1:15:23] I really born again do I really have the
[1:15:25] Holy Ghost have I really entered into
[1:15:27] that Holy of Holies amen with God amen
[1:15:31] or is the word or am I just retaining
[1:15:34] the word up here but it's not really
[1:15:37] coming down here
[1:15:38] amen amen praise the Lord
[1:15:43] in Psalm 63 verse 2 look what the Bible
[1:15:48] says here to see thy power and thy glory
[1:15:50] so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary
[1:15:53] because thy loving-kindness is better
[1:15:55] than life man my lips shall praise thee
[1:15:59] thus well I bless thee will will I bless
[1:16:03] thee will I lit while I live I will lift
[1:16:05] up my hands and I name my soul shall be
[1:16:08] satisfied as with marrow and fatness and
[1:16:10] my mouth shall praise thee with joyful
[1:16:13] lips when I remember the upon my bed and
[1:16:17] meditate on the end the night watches
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:23] that of us being on our bed at night and
[1:16:26] then with the cell phone in our hand
[1:16:32] doing who knows what how much better it
[1:16:37] is if you just meditate on God praise
[1:16:42] God
[1:16:43] cuz that David you know we were saying
[1:16:45] this of course he didn't have no cell
[1:16:47] phone back then so that's all they could
[1:16:49] do turn out the lights and that was it
[1:16:52] you know son go down that was it amen
[1:16:56] meditate on God amen because thou has
[1:17:01] been my help therefore in the shadow of
[1:17:03] thy Wings will I rejoice my soul
[1:17:06] followeth hard after thee
[1:17:08] I like that hard after thee amen not not
[1:17:13] but hard I right hand up hold with me
[1:17:17] praise God
[1:17:20] amen praise the Lord and it was and
[1:17:24] we'll read this last quote here brother
[1:17:27] Branham says and the mercy seat speaking
[1:17:38] about the mercy seat which no one could
[1:17:41] approach unless there was an atonement
[1:17:42] there for that person only way that the
[1:17:46] sanctuary when it was sprinkled of the
[1:17:48] blood the sea I have mine brother
[1:17:57] Anderson fixed it for me so that can't i
[1:17:59] reaiiy can read this one only way that
[1:18:02] the sanctuary when it was sprinkled of
[1:18:03] the blood then it became a mercy seat
[1:18:05] but after the blood was taken up then it
[1:18:07] became a judgment seat all right so
[1:18:11] let's keep reading in other words while
[1:18:14] the blood was still there on the on on
[1:18:17] the mercy seat right well the blood was
[1:18:22] still there a man there was mercy for
[1:18:27] the people right there was mercy for the
[1:18:30] people of the blows still there but then
[1:18:31] come the time loco brother brain says a
[1:18:33] no mind no one could stand the judgments
[1:18:35] of God the only thing the only thing
[1:18:38] that we can look for is mercy not
[1:18:40] judgment our righteous righteousness we
[1:18:42] cannot approach his justice because his
[1:18:44] justice he'll have to keep his word and
[1:18:46] keeping his word the day you eat thereof
[1:18:49] the day you die who would want justice I
[1:18:51] don't want justice I call for mercy my
[1:18:54] let the mercy of God in the mercy seat
[1:18:56] sprinkled but there was a time of the
[1:18:58] cleansing of the sanctuary right when it
[1:19:01] was a judgement seat as long as the
[1:19:03] blood was off of the seat there come a
[1:19:06] time when they would have to cleanse
[1:19:07] take that blood because there had to be
[1:19:09] a new blood that had to be sprinkled on
[1:19:13] the mercy seat but while that blood was
[1:19:15] it wasn't there there was there was
[1:19:17] judgment Amen but when that blood was
[1:19:20] there Amen then it was mercy for the
[1:19:23] people now we're approaching that time
[1:19:25] now we are now approaching in this
[1:19:27] a cleansing of the sanctuary and the
[1:19:29] judgments coming upon the earth see as
[1:19:31] long as blood is there God cannot
[1:19:33] destroy the earth long as blood is there
[1:19:36] nobody's a sinner before God everybody's
[1:19:39] right because there's an atonement for
[1:19:41] everybody all right but if you fail to
[1:19:44] accept that atonement and go into his
[1:19:46] presence then you are a sinner in other
[1:19:49] words you fail to go into that inner
[1:19:51] veil and to really fall in love with God
[1:19:54] amen because there's an atonement for
[1:19:58] everybody but if you fail to accept that
[1:19:59] atonement and go into present then you
[1:20:00] are sinner you're beyond that mercy then
[1:20:03] you've judged yourself but now while
[1:20:05] there is mercy but when the cleansing of
[1:20:07] the sanctuary comes the blood goes off
[1:20:09] the mercy seat and then the wrath of God
[1:20:11] falls upon the earth oh my god be
[1:20:13] merciful to us that we be not in that
[1:20:15] they found without mercies of God amen
[1:20:18] praise God so Saints so afraid of drop
[1:20:24] this thing thinks we want to make sure
[1:20:28] Amen we are in amen always looking to

[1:31:13] pray one for another what will it be
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:21] over yonder
[1:31:25] and join the throne upon the glassy sea
[1:31:36] Oh will joy
[1:31:40] loved ones and crown rise forever
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:47] oh this is just what heaven means to me
[1:31:58] Oh what will it be
[1:32:03] when we get over y'all
[1:32:10] and join the throne upon the glassy sea
[1:32:21] we will join their loved ones and ground
[1:32:26] cries forever
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:31] oh this is just whatever means to me
[1:32:41] Oh what will it be when we get over
[1:32:50] yonder and join the throne upon the
[1:32:59] glassy sea
[1:33:05] join their loved ones and grand-prize
[1:33:10] forever
[1:33:14] and this is just what heaven means to me
[1:33:24] [Music]
