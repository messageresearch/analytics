TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right we are in the book of Hebrews and we are on chapter 5 we got down to verse Abel's gonna back up a little bit review for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men and things pertaining to God that you may offer like different sacrifices percentage who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way when the himself is compassed with infirmity and by reason here of he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer percent so in other words a saying is a high priest was not sinless itself a high priest of normal human high priest has had sin problems - he wasn't he was only set aside to do a job but he still for the people and also for himself percent because when he made that offering in the in the temple in the Holy of Holies he made it for itself and the people he didn't make it for the people it made for itself but now what's he fixing to tell us though Christ didn't need that cos didn't didn't come to die for itself he came to die for us and by recent hear me all okay no man taketh dishonouring to himself but he that has called of God as was Aaron so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but that he said unto Him thou art my son today have I begotten thee so in other words he was the son of God he wasn't a high priest but he was not a high priest like we're high priest so what happened is is Paul's telling us in the Old Testament you had the high priest he was the only one I mean Christ was known earth God wouldn't not one here he was he was about the people but the high priest that was on the earth was doing the work but that high priest needed a sacrifice also so God sent his son to sacrifice as he except also in another place our two priests after the order of melchizedek now remember in the Old Testament there was it was called the I'm sorry the Aaron ik our errant priesthood which you had Levi's severed Sara Sara then that ended with Christ but now remember it was the order of Melchizedek we are under the order of Melchizedek look Melchizedek is not a priest Jesus Christ is our break I'm not rich okay Melchizedek was a form God took a form God took in the Old Testament but that's not our brother that's not our Savior what was inside that man was our Savior but Melchizedek the flesh man that talked to Abraham was a created body the flesh body then when God was finished talking to Abraham he just when he went into another dimension he just it would be fun to watch now when milk has a day when God Almighty steps in you know it's a faster dimension so when he stepped in that faster dimension you just saw a little dust flutter down to the ground I mean rarely that was his body brother brown said he just took 16 elements of Earth put it over his put it over to the aqua knee but when he went back into that seat couldn't take it wedding the only time you can take flex that's why Christ is our high priest he took his flesh into another dimension right he took his flesh into another dimension he's got a body changed and took that flesh and other dimension melchizedek did not he had to come back as Jesus Christ because Melchizedek wasn't a son the flesh Melchizedek was not son he was a created being absolutely they look like a 20 year old Jesus not Jesus do you feel them all up in the Anthony never would listen god never though never looked old so milk as a nickel didn't look oh no Cass I think was a young guy like 20 years old walked up to Abraham come listen think about this here's Abraham 99 years old all right Abraham's ninety-nine years old getting along in life there you know tell like all of us and then he meets Melchizedek that's going to give me my body change in milk air as it looks older than him you can't have that no a youthful milk as a big sense about the time of life you're gonna have a child and your body's gonna he didn't say that in the Bible but that's what happened his body was changed back so what a young man 20 year old young person so so yes Melchizedek was a young man and Jesus Christ only grew older in his human body because he was in this world all right he wasn't born in sin but he was born in a sinful world so he was 30 which he looked 50 because of his leaving look at brother branham he died at 56 years old I'm 59 he looked older than me when he was 56 if you look at the pictures of his hand it's like a wrinkled old oh man why because of the office that he carried right but we'll never see that again to them he's already standing in that condition now where he's already changed back so as Christ glorified not himself to be made of concrete but he that said unto Him thou art my son today have I begotten thee as he steps also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order now not now Kevin II the order of Melchizedek but who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears under him that was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered because remember Christ did not overcome at the cross no that was the act afterward the property God said he overcame in the Garden of Gethsemane you got to have a guest there any experience before you can have a crucifixion experience so in the Garden of Gethsemane is where he fought it out and won the battle the overcoming was done when he said father not my will but thy will be done in other words I'm going to what I need to do and I'm very willing to do it all right don't leave our son yet he learned to be about things with your suffering and being made perfect now look Christ did inside man didn't need to be made perfect you see this man here but this man when this man come into human flesh that body had to be perfected it was like we said he looked fifty years old but when he come out of that tomb on Easter morning he didn't look like he did it's obvious he didn't look like he did Mary Magdalene didn't know who he was the disciples had a problem with it because they didn't know when he was 20 years old so it was having a problem with this guy that says but remember when she heard the voices divorcing never changed when she heard the voice when he said Mary she said Ravana our master and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him yes we know there's any SS Christ but he was the author of eternal salvation now if he's the author of eternal salvation that has to be a recipient somebody read the book he's the author and finisher of our faith all right and like we've been saying he's the author of eternal salvation but once she received salvation once you received the new birth I was talking to a guy yesterday a beekeeper friend of mine and he's he's more maybe Church of God or maybe a little Pentecostal but he he has a problem with the once saved always safe so he and I got any pretty good discussion you know and he said talking about being different from being born-again and being saved he said they're definitely different I said yeah there's a difference but we were talking about if you take this yes once they'd always say eternal salvation all right do you receive the new birth in your soul you are eternal as God is that's what we're missing we're not getting that part fully is that we're already in eternal person all right we're gonna talk a little about that this afternoon because brother Graham talks about omnipotence do you ever look the word on the impotence up I mean if this means all-powerful brother Brown says when to omnipotence meet which is us and him so we'll talk about that but look being made perfect made us perfect all right called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek all right now you what Melchizedek anymore because remember they went away Jesus Christ came on the same there's no more Melchizedek all right but in the order that it came in the order that it came it was in the order of Melchizedek all right you know and you look at this title and I was trying to think of a way to say this but really Melchizedek doesn't have anything to do with us in that form he did come she had to go to Abraham because he couldn't be born of a virgin at that moment so he was a messenger he was one that brought a message to Abraham no we know that Melchizedek had to me neighbor him to change his body but Melchizedek the flesh ordered the flesh part of Melchizedek we were talking about before when they when that guy went back into that faster dimension it just dropped the elements back down on the earth and it became earth again there was no flesh went into another dimension with no cavity but with Jesus Christ being the author and finisher of our faith he took his flesh into a flat faster dimension showing that we can be glorified on this side and carry it somewhere else with us all right the call of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered there's listen there's a lot of people there's a lot of people there's a doctrine in them in the denominations that Melchizedek was just a priesthood it wasn't a person it's a Melchizedek Priesthood which is can they take that in the things in the Mormons or somewhere they take that Melchizedek Priesthood as their preachers I don't want to be that because that man was my Savior that man didn't say my soul okay that name person that order of Melchizedek now it brought us to because they have you come to Abraham Abraham was faith faithful he you had to have faith Abraham had to have faith that that man Cassady was something difficulty said my lord capital all right opponent we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing it's your dough of hearing because there probably was contention back then as there is now is this a real person or is this just an order it's just is it just a bunch of priests no it was a man okay the Bible says the man well kids and that thing will get into a Hebrew sticks and he doesn't leave this Paul doesn't leave this he continued on with this Melchizedek Priesthood of then we have many things that's saying hard to be under senior adult hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles are what is that Oracle's it is sayings or teachings of God and I become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat so what's Paul saying he said your your your appear worried about if it was a man or worried about if it was a priest today that man already disappeared that man's gone that order of Melchizedek comes back into the Old Testament I want Jesus Christ Jesus Christ went to the cross for me male kinds of things did not that allure do you understand that that position that Christ took now we know what was inside of him did because it's not going to change it's the very same person all the way down that's why Jesus stood one day and said before Abraham was I am okay he was before Abraham what the inside person not the not the flesh milk as it ain't no not that person reverie wine for everyone that uses milk is unskillful nothing wrong with milk for takers of milk for everyone that are protectors of milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness right for he is a babe but strong means she worked it word strong means solid food belongs to them that are of full age or of maturity mature all right strong meat belong to them to Dermot or even those who by reason of use look by reason of use yeah it's like the lease of sin we need to practice when he'd come church need to read your Bible we need to pray and do the things of God have their senses exercised that's what you do every day see that we're trained to discern both good and evil so that's why you have to start out with milk which is fine the Paul's telling you you just use milk your unskillful your baby but strong meat belongs to them that are mature age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil the only way you're going to discern good and evil that's what let me get this off you'll be skillful in the word because take a baby take a baby and give them 10th grade algebra or 12th grade algebra give it to a six-year-old child well they're just gonna sit there stare at the page right there go just look at the page there's this thing right there's there's numbers there and they've got a brain and they're human they're gonna they're gonna step down they're gonna look at it but give that person some time are some training or some teaching and then like the Anna now she's doing a couple of grades ahead in math you know why cuz she keeps practicing she like I said can't practices she keeps practicing her mouth she practices math all the time she'll sit there one day and you'll see a whole list of problems that she's done you know she'll she'll say here give me some problems today so why she's exercising she's exercising what her human brain which we should exercise our spirit realm to accept the things of God so the problem with this whole thing is is face I've come to the conclusion after all these years that we just don't have enough faith about what God is already saying okay we just don't have enough faith program said we don't have enough bang for a headache that was nothing 60 something we should be look to the place not that everything is listen you know yeah everybody's got something today there's a list of something that's wrong with them right right so that doesn't mean that you're lost it just means we're living in the human body but we must overcome that in what go on to perfection being trained more and more being trained by the Word of God through good teachers as brother Louise was on that Wednesday night it has to be done even the order of Melchizedek was Melchizedek brought a message to Abraham okay he brought that message to Abraham now what did Abraham do brother branham said hey the reason God did these things for Abraham paraphrasing sorry I'm gonna paraphrase the quote is that he knew that Abraham would tell his next generation that Abraham was generation would tell the next generation and all the way down people he would tell him why tell them about why tell them about the good news the gospel what happened to it my if I said they're 99 years old and dead is a hammer and all of a sudden the next morning I wake up and I'm 20 years old again and I let go they're sterile 20 years old again he was happy about nothing so he told this next generation how that God had changed his body that God had brought him back I mean it's kind of obvious that Abraham and Isaac with Sarah right that when they got changed but remember several years later he married cateura and had seven more kids well obviously I was level was way older than them youngins learner so Abraham could say look when I got changed this is what happened and then mama died and then I had these other I had this other group of people I could tell my story to okay then i okay with it so now we were loading a look back you got to go back remember this the paragraph or the chapter doesn't end here strong meat belongs to them to their full age even those who by whom you who by means reason them use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil keep reading therefore leaving the principles what does that principles mean Elementary discussion of okay it's alright to talk about one gun water baptism and and all these things but let's go on leaving the principles of the doctrine doctrine of Christ not doctrines doctrine of Christ let us go on unto what completion or maturity let us go on to maturity not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God you see that that's what I've been trying to tell you I don't have to have faith that's what I was telling that man yesterday I don't have you know because a lot of times especially in denominations they said well I hope we have this hope I have hope I said gene I don't have hope anymore I said I have an assured he I've know if I'm born again I know we'll see he couldn't understand that that was a little too close for him you know but I said look I said I don't have to have faith times I had to have faith when I got in the car because I didn't know if the car was gonna make it to your house I was only five miles from he's a beekeeper friendly man and I went over to get something from him I said gene I don't need faith to come visit you that faith is behind me that faith is in the journey when I'm standing here in front of you I don't have to have faith okay look I said I don't even have to have a whole I hope I'm gonna see I'm looking at you right so that's the same thing with here we can have a hope but I think what the prophet of God brought us was not a hope he took all that denominational worried about like I said before and I will say it again about they got to go through the tribulation that's something you go to bed any denominational Church ask them do I have to go through tribulations they will say yes you have to go if we have we're not know no imperfect no not one ain't got nothing you ain't perfect you ain't perfect you know I said wait a second that's all I understand what God said about me I just want to tell in genius today I said look if I'm a child of God how can I be good yeah I'm judged by Christ and if he's perfect now I'm perfect he kind of look you know maybe James are pretty he's any seventies and he's he's a good he's just he's a real good nominal Christian but he still has problems with some of their doctrines in you you talk to some of them and we never got into the tribulation part of it but they're saying you got to go through the tribulation to be purified when we as bride know that we're purified here and we don't have to do that right and that's one of the major doctrines of them versus what we have and I don't mean them I mean they dot way that's what they've been taught what they've been taught somebody came up with that God did something some man came up with that doctrine well we gotta go to the tree we're not perfect you know well I I don't see that but see look not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God in other words you shouldn't have to have faith that you're saved if you're born again rest in that put that away but if you're not you better worry about it but if you're born again just don't even worry about that foot back to the side you know what worry about going up worry about exercising what you've already got right of the doctrine of baptism and the laying on of hands would have been through all this all right I don't have to you know I don't have to go get rebaptised okay unless you've got a problem if you want a problem why do you have to go back and visit being rebaptised now the babies in Christ yes they need to be baptized but once you're baptized something Lord Jesus Christ and believe to the new birth you should not have to go back and have to do it again that's what he's saying here of the doctrine of Baptism and ableo avanza I'm sorry Paul tells us to leave that Paul says leave laying on of hands alright we've been through that knob you can believe that if you want to but it's just it's right there in the Bible if you don't believe the Bible then you're not believing because look and a resurrection of the Dead and of eternal judgment we must put all that away and this will we do if gun permit all right but now a week people in just I'm sorry we people have two hands they don't just the way they're sorry I told you what brother I've said about it right the Jewish tradition in whatever them wasn't a Gentile tradition if they do tradition brought in by the weakness of people for it is impossible I like that word pulses it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost now that doesn't mean you give to Holy Ghost and if you were made for takers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew again into repentance in other words if you got if you were particular to the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost you're not going to do this if they shall fall away we see these people now this this you know priests like a house on fire on a windy day and I set one time to listen to - a brother preached and he did the best job I ever heard about the millennium and different things he was sleeping with a 14 year old girl life preaching that sermon so yeah but and that's the fact not a not a lot of hope so that's a bad but so remember if you shall fall away what he was doing he was preaching off of just pure intellect my brother Graham said it's really simple to read the Bible and say you need to be baptized name of Jesus Christ you know I meant just ability to read but if he had the Holy Ghost inside he wouldn't be doing that alright big difference in all that but it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made protective of the Holy Ghost see if you remain particular to the Holy Ghost you're not going to fall away you might backslide you might do some things wrong but you're not going to go like that and go back that way if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame in other words man helping are again how shameful would that be for the earth with drinketh in the rain that coming off the opponent and bringing urghhh meet for them by him in his dress receiveth blessing blessing from God but that which back thorn and brothers is rejected in nine the cursing who's ended to be burned but now remember they received the same rain they received the same nutrition the covers and the good grass you go look out your yard today and you're gonna see him bit Nettles you're gonna see thorns you're gonna see and you know what they're going how this rain is great cuz we're growing right out with your great little grass we're going around with it but remember they will show their character about what they grow not what comes up only in us candy takes a cooker burner and make them make a wheat plant out of all right but window cuckoo bird seeds in the ground is just don't make color works ain't gonna come up one day and all of a sudden you're gonna go oh I love this this grass you know no it's always going to because of our eye but remember when it starts up about this high and all this about the same green sprouts roots but when it starts bearing its fruit but that which bears thorns and briers is rejected at 9:00 the cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you all right in other words we complement of so Paul has a group of people that he's confident with that there is a group of people it's what I've been telling you there I'm confident there's a group of people gonna take a body change here today here somewhere on this earth maybe not in this building I'm not I'm not so I'm just saying somewhere there's got to be somebody who's gonna believe what's already been said yes but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we the speak so in other words you see this this company salvation the statue of a perfect man it accompanies your salvation all right because then you exercise these gifts and you become degree you can handle things of God power without character remember power without character it's the tannic because you use it wrong because you're born we're still with that sticky nature attached to you somewhat of this world and you'll use it wrong that's why Christ that overcomes the garden I mean after the garden he was being stripped naked beat put a crown of thorns and he never uttered the word hardly you know without say you know are you saying in other words and then here he was the mandate that raised Lazarus from the tomb and stopped the wind and raised Gary's his daughter and all these powerful things when he was stripped of all that yet he did not you know the song he could have called ten thousand angels well he could if he was God I didn't leave him the anointing left and God didn't leave him in still God yes alright but he'll did itself to what his job his job was was going across okay and that's our job our job to go to the cross but not to hang him up again like I said back up there them you can't keep putting him on the cross and the problem with most people is they can't get him off the cross and give him inside of you I love what that man said he was a denominational man he done a good job but he said where were we have a historical God we don't want a historical God we want a now God you know somebody now well maybe they're catching on a little bit well I know I'm saying cuz Christ died on the cross and I don't mean nothing I just you know you're just looking at a scene but when that man comes inside of you that's the difference for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which he have showed toward his name in the 'i have ministered to the saints and do minister master you shoulda read that scripture but you're not thinking what the weeks are talking about means tonight there are a lot of good gospel ministers in this message seeing their people leave leave them leave them leave the congregation to stay home and watch tape or listening to tape from jefferson bill i'm gonna say it now i stone place is coming from and and here they are they're good ministers and now they're having to you know readjust or even get jobs because their congregation is one with nothing well you know what it's not him small yes those people fall and it's those people up north you don't ignore those people up north fall for dragging them away because it's not right it's wrong right yeah there's nothing right about it not one thing there's not one thing right about it or you turn the bible completely apart music but it is hurting and that's where you can feel the hurt only tonight you can feel the hurt knowing somebody standing there with a congregation of 50 or 75 people and you're preaching the way and all of a sudden there's 20 you wonder where they went what did they go to another church now they're saying the home listening to yep Bob talks about the king of the north but listen I'm telling you that's the problem though it's wrong what's wrong is wrong you need to call it wrong it's wrong and you know what it is it's back to right over here mature mature Bragg will never fall for that never I'm not saying that these people are not born again but they're just babies right but now I'm telling you with the Holy Ghost inside of you how's it going to drawing you away from what the Bible says I can't do it that's what I mean there's a lot of people in this message that are not warning in that thought they were because of thinking that they did the hair and the dress and the do's and the don'ts and the ten commandments and all that and you know right but people and it may happen in this church but I don't think you well we've been established enough to know the brother Dale told us to get born again and getting born again sure helps a lot it's everything because brother Branham said remember the Bible says it will deceive the very elect if it were possible brother Brown said you can't deceive the elect but frankly if you'll only time I think he ever used the word frankly put frankly in your in your table and he says he one time in the church days book he says but frankly God will have to cut the work short because you get her confused well that's what's happening now it's the confusion even though they say I'm right and I'm wrong or whatever you want to say there's a confusion there and we know who it is God is not the author of confusion right so we know I see other guys all right if I okay with that family I'm saying well I don't have to eat any what's gonna happen if they start signs and wonders somewhere I still ain't gonna believe because they're not doing it right to start with their foundation is not right go back to the foundation all right you know what I'm not doing like somebody in the message called him Antichrist I'm not gonna do that at the moment they look a little anti word a lot of anti word but you can come back I mean you can use that's not up that's not a sin unto death unless you carry it onto them you know so you understand what I'm saying this I don't praying that God will turn Abel because what about a great thing if he turn it all back around Brooke should be what a great thing it would be I mean it would be powerful to low to use the resources that they have for for the right thing but people get trapped they're babies this seat feels good sounds good you don't smell anything mm-hmm and I'll bet you I don't say that I'll promise you Paul had to deal with stuff like that I bet you they did think Paul was God at one time but all the miracles and things that he'd done but you don't read it in the Bible because it's not read but there had to be some because even Paul says you know he said you've got some of Cephas and some of this and he said some of Paul and some of this one he said Apollo's water or Paul water and Apollo whatever yeah but you understand he named names about people that were in the congregation they were saying well Paul you know the same way with brother branham I would assume if you were around that man and he could tell you what you're gonna do in 15 minutes and how many fish you're gonna catch the next day and the day after you remember that I read that the other day where brother Brown told that man he was trying to convert this guy and his grandpa comes in so I don't believe know that we're brother Ron said okay you tell your grandfather we're gonna catch one fish tomorrow I'm gonna catch 6 the next day and the next day they're not gonna catch anything we're not gonna catch anything and and the you know the grandfather's life you know happened exactly they said they'd fish I mean the hardest thing a thing you cannot do God God brother Ralph saw that Division will then he said at the end the grandpa just softened up and said well there must be something to this we converted even took running form or some people need them that's right it was brother woods and his granddaddy your brother woods in his day you wanted the whole family right yeah that's what it was you're right no television took a bishop and said I'm gonna catch one fish today and it's going to be the biggest one of the whole trail but I'm going to catch six tomorrow y'all that Widow kicks in like and they stay well now that's three days out and I mean you're going now I put the biggest worm and put the biggest Lord I'll guarantee they tried to prove me wrong I would have taken I wouldn't say you know but you know what you can't do God have a purpose in that brother Brown wasn't showing off he was showing those people that what he was preaching was the truth that's the pay of the hook they didn't catch them fish the problem is they didn't see the allegory to that there was no fish caught the last day but there was some eternal fish that were caught that day the whole with him he was caught that day by the Prophet and same thing with you and I we don't have to be prophets but things in our life we can show people we can be examples of a Christianity that will bring somebody in you don't even know that you do it you know for God it's not righteous to forget your work and labor that's what we're talking about here couple of which he have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence till the full of chefs are hoping them go preach go go spread the gospel we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the fullest shots of hope unto the end that you be not slothful like a same we do not you know I'm sorry I said lazy they're just people are lazy to not get a to what are you gonna overcome if you sit at home with coffee in your slippers on and and watch or listen to a sermon or even watch this this church when the doors are opening you're healthy to get here like I said the other night about brother Colley he's in his late 70s and that Guildford they many services he's missed in the years I'm talking about you couldn't put him on that calendar how many he has missed in 50 years of coming here since 1974 I think again and you know why he told me the other day he said it's getting hard but you know what he never shut up quick hey I'm coming look sister Trudy the same way she traveled all the four hours both ways to come to church all those years good okay there's a reward for that yes ma'am there's never a reward for that yeah that she be not slothful which that would be lazy are sluggish sluggards but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises of them that preach the gospel Colette's where you going to get your food from you're going to get it from from mama Eagle that choose the food up for you and give it to you all right because remember we're equals Eagles don't ever have Milty always ate they start off eating meat for when God made promised to Abraham because he could swear my by no grapes were by himself when he made his own nose in the only he's for myself see we're not to swear to God but God can swear by itself because there's nobody else to swear by he swears by his own
