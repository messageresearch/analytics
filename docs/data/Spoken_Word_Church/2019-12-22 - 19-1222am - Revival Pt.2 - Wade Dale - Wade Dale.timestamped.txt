[23:01] you into into January so god bless you
[23:04] let's go to Psalms 85
[23:06] verse one we've been speaking last winds
[23:09] there a couple winds ease go on revival
[23:11] just to set up just to set a basis here
[23:14] because we have to understand what
[23:17] brings revival what happens at a revival
[23:20] and what happens after a revival because
[23:24] there's been many many revivals but as
[23:27] we look here and we're going to read in
[23:29] the scripture that there's one more left
[23:32] and we're it so we can look at the
[23:36] examples of all the other revivals and
[23:38] we're going to do that we're going to
[23:41] track them all the way through the Bible
[23:42] we did one couple winds these ago we'll
[23:45] do one or two more today but I want you
[23:48] to see what what happens during the
[23:50] revival that way you'll know what's
[23:53] going on when you know you're in a
[23:54] revival man
[23:55] so the Book of Psalms verse 85 I mean
[23:58] chapter 85 verse 1 through 7 and let's
[24:01] bow our heads before we get started
[24:03] thank you Jesus for this day that we can
[24:07] come Lord in a building that's warm no
[24:10] rain on our head the Father we know
[24:12] there's many people across the world
[24:15] that are still assembling today in cold
[24:17] buildings and dirt floors and not much
[24:21] over their head but we serve the same
[24:23] God and we're going to the same place if
[24:27] they're bride of Jesus Christ were going
[24:28] to a city a city that is eternal that
[24:33] we'll never have to worry about rain
[24:35] anymore and all the cold winds blowing
[24:37] and going to funerals and all these
[24:40] different things Lord it'll be a
[24:41] glorious time but we've got to get ready
[24:43] here we've got to make our preparation
[24:46] at this point so we can get there father
[24:50] we know that the journeys been long and
[24:53] hard and for many Lord this too even
[24:56] that just come in Lord it still has been
[24:58] a journey that's been rough because
[25:02] truthfully the Lord even when you were
[25:04] on earth they called you a devil so
[25:07] they're gonna also do the same thing to
[25:08] us father we ask you to forgive us of
[25:11] our sins be with the visitors that are
[25:13] with us today be with the ones that are
[25:15] not with us today be the ones that are
[25:16] sick the ones that need salvation father
[25:19] we still believe
[25:20] that you're a Salvation God that you'll
[25:23] save the souls of the unsaved and bring
[25:27] sinners to Christ father be with us and
[25:29] take care of us
[25:30] place the missionaries on the foreign
[25:32] fields or did you take over the service
[25:35] you have your will and you have your way
[25:36] in Jesus name we pray amen so I'm 285 1
[25:40] to the chief musician a psalm for the
[25:42] son of Korah Lord thou has been
[25:44] favorable into thy land thou has brought
[25:47] back the captivity of Jacob thou has
[25:50] forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou
[25:53] has covered all their sin thou has taken
[25:56] away all thy wrath it sounds pretty good
[25:58] that it now has turned thyself from the
[26:00] fierceness of that anger turn us O God
[26:03] of our salvation and caused on anger
[26:07] toward us decease wilt thou be angry
[26:10] with us forever this is David remember
[26:13] wilt thou draw out thine anger to all
[26:15] generations wilt thou not revive us
[26:19] again that the people may rejoice indeed
[26:24] because every time there's a revival
[26:25] there's a rejoicing alright show us thy
[26:28] mercy O Lord and grant us thy salvation
[26:31] now let's go to 2nd chronicles 7 verse
[26:34] 14 now remember this is this is speaking
[26:41] of the children of Israel but we are the
[26:44] people of God also where this is the
[26:47] present day revelation so we're looking
[26:49] at a present day truth we use the Jews
[26:52] for an example the Bible tells us in in
[26:56] 2nd Corinthians I believe that all this
[26:58] is given in the Old Testament for our
[27:00] example alright for those are the ends
[27:04] of the world come upon so you and I have
[27:05] the eyes thinking the other day
[27:08] if you're not if you're not in the
[27:10] revelation of the present day truth
[27:12] and I don't want to say the message I'm
[27:15] saying the present day truth revelation
[27:17] then you're under a closed book and you
[27:19] cannot see the total plan of redemption
[27:21] so you can't take a body change that's
[27:24] why God can't give a revival to the
[27:26] denominations they're so divided and
[27:30] we're going to bring a home in just a
[27:31] little while and see that it's the same
[27:33] right here
[27:34] mine eyes shall be open if my people
[27:36] which are called by my name shall humble
[27:39] themselves and pray now what'd I tell
[27:41] you last week brother Brown said prayer
[27:43] and reading your Bible would get you
[27:46] closer to God but that also begins a
[27:48] revival all right so listen to what the
[27:50] prophet of God said in just a minute and
[27:53] pray and seek my face and turn from
[27:54] their wicked ways then will I hear from
[27:56] heaven and will forgive their sin and
[27:59] will heal their land what land are we
[28:01] talking about this is the land we're
[28:04] talking about right here I'm not worried
[28:06] about the physical land it takes care of
[28:08] itself we need to take care of this land
[28:10] this is the land that's that that we're
[28:13] dealing with now now mine eyes shall be
[28:15] opened and my ears shall attend unto the
[28:18] prayer that is made in this place for
[28:20] now have I chosen and sanctified this
[28:23] house this house not this building it's
[28:29] already been dedicated but we got to
[28:31] dedicate this house this is the temple
[28:34] that we got to deal with for now I have
[28:36] chosen now buddy when God chooses
[28:40] something he don't let it go amen now
[28:44] mine eyes shall be open to my ear shall
[28:46] attend unto the prayer that is made in
[28:47] this place for now how about choosing
[28:50] and sanctified this house that my name
[28:53] may be there forever and my eyes and my
[28:57] heart shall be there perpetually in
[29:00] other words from generation to
[29:02] generation are from eternity to eternity
[29:04] you may be seated in the Lord that is a
[29:06] blessing to the reading of the word
[29:07] we're gonna good we get to services we
[29:11] we can kind of go to a place and stop
[29:13] and pick it up this afternoon so Lord
[29:16] bless him we're gonna speak on revival
[29:18] now now listen there's a lot of times we
[29:20] look and we see that when we talk about
[29:23] revival the first thing you think of is
[29:25] is is you know me and brother Dale gets
[29:28] together and we talked to the musicians
[29:30] and we we talk to the song leaders and
[29:33] and we want some of that get music that
[29:36] you know somebody making music you've
[29:39] never been to Jamaica you ought to go
[29:41] one time they know how to worship I said
[29:45] they know how to worship but it's not
[29:47] all just worship you
[29:48] know what you worshipping about a man
[29:50] and I believe if we know what we're
[29:52] worshipping about we don't have to build
[29:54] up anything we don't have to push down
[29:58] anything but if you get in a revival the
[30:02] prophet of God said we'll read in just a
[30:04] minute that it's a personal revival and
[30:08] it begins with you and me so now let's
[30:11] look in the Hebrew lexicon and see what
[30:13] that word revival means now remember
[30:16] revival doesn't mean resurrection
[30:21] revival does not mean resurrection
[30:24] getting born again is a resurrection a
[30:28] revival is reviving what's already there
[30:32] so if you don't have anything there I
[30:34] mean in your soul if there's nothing
[30:36] there you can't have a revival you got
[30:39] to have a resurrection you got to have a
[30:41] dying out to yourself come into the
[30:44] household of God and then you can have a
[30:47] revival of what you've already got
[30:49] hey brother BAM tells us and we're
[30:51] reading a little while we're that even
[30:53] during a revival which means to revive
[30:55] what you already have that as the neck
[30:58] goes out that there are centers that
[31:00] come in there are healings that come in
[31:02] so this revival is not just well if
[31:04] you're if you're a sinner you can't get
[31:06] saved under revival yes you can because
[31:10] you know what a revival may let you
[31:12] realize that you ain't got what you
[31:14] think you got hey ma'am so let's look at
[31:17] the Hebrew let's gonna see what it says
[31:19] about I'm gonna slow down a little bit
[31:24] sorry to leave the word revival to live
[31:29] have life not get life right have life
[31:34] remain alive sustain life brother Nels
[31:39] always said he's been in a revival since
[31:41] she's coming in this message why he got
[31:42] born again come into the message of the
[31:43] hour he's been in a personal revival
[31:46] hey ma'am I hope he has he's been our
[31:48] pastor for 40 years sustain life live
[31:52] prosperously live forever be quickened
[31:58] I hope god quickens what you have be
[32:03] alive be restored to life and health to
[32:07] continue in life or remain alive now
[32:11] what are you and I you and I are today
[32:13] are alive and I want to remain alive
[32:17] because the scripture says those who are
[32:19] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[32:23] Lord shall not prevent or hinder those
[32:25] which are asleep for the trumpet of God
[32:27] shall sound and the dead in Christ shall
[32:29] rise first now that's going to be a
[32:31] revival you know why because they went
[32:34] down with something
[32:35] their physical body died but their soul
[32:39] didn't die their soul is still that
[32:42] quickening power in another dimension
[32:45] waiting on us to have our revival to get
[32:48] this sky changed and then it's going to
[32:50] pull them out of the ground what do you
[32:53] think the property God called it first
[32:54] pull second pull third pull we're
[32:57] pulling something we're pulling them out
[33:00] of the ground but like I said before
[33:05] it's not gonna be done by how much
[33:08] emotion so much at first cuz we're gonna
[33:14] look here in a minute the children of
[33:15] Israel
[33:16] I mean people we have to go to Walmart
[33:19] and the grocery store to get our food
[33:22] right and if we want water we have to go
[33:26] buy it at Aldi I like Aldi water right
[33:33] God said 2 million people in a dry
[33:38] wilderness and their shoes never wore
[33:42] out
[33:42] they walked for 40 years and they got to
[33:46] a place and said in other words God
[33:50] ain't done nothing for us rained manna
[33:54] every day all they had to do was step
[33:58] out of their tent pick it up put it in a
[34:00] basket and go sit down and eat it
[34:03] this gushing water from a rock running
[34:07] down through the children of Israel and
[34:10] they just dipped up
[34:11] of it and it never did run dry until
[34:14] they got in the promised land but they
[34:17] still with all that great sign and
[34:20] wonder they murmured every single day
[34:25] God even sent him meat because they
[34:29] asked for it but there was a plague
[34:33] attached to that because that wasn't
[34:36] God's perfect will God's perfect will
[34:38] was from the eat that man are coming out
[34:40] of heaven cuz it had every immigrant
[34:42] what about that you know we have to i
[34:44] took a handful of vitamins every morning
[34:45] every afternoon why because we don't get
[34:48] as much nutrition from our food in that
[34:50] little way for a food everything they
[34:54] needed i would have loved it kept some
[34:57] of that because it'll sustain you
[35:00] but still they murmured that's the same
[35:02] way with us we've come down to the end
[35:04] of the road we've come down to this part
[35:06] of this long journey i know we're still
[35:08] murmuring and complaining about what god
[35:10] is not doing for us
[35:12] come on should not be that way we should
[35:18] be the happiest people in the face there
[35:20] he's give us an open book he's even give
[35:23] us the message hey listen when we first
[35:25] started this church that whole back wall
[35:28] was full of 880 thrills you couldn't
[35:32] take but about four or five home with
[35:33] you they were this behind some of you
[35:35] remember the old 80's real then God give
[35:39] us cassettes a little bit smaller yeah
[35:41] you could haul them a little bit better
[35:43] now that phone you're sitting right
[35:47] beside of has got the whole level
[35:49] another sermons on it so what's God give
[35:55] us and we're still murmuring and
[35:56] complaining amen so to live have live
[36:01] sustain life as I said many times before
[36:05] I love that scripture says those who
[36:06] endure to the end shall be saved
[36:10] those who endure to the end there was
[36:13] only two people endured that 40-year
[36:15] journey
[36:16] Joshua and Caleb two people now you know
[36:21] that was that twenty eight twenty year
[36:22] old and younger but they were
[36:24] that whole thing coming up the old
[36:27] people had to die out because their
[36:29] ideas you know that guards not doing
[36:31] anything for us we need to go back to
[36:33] Egypt we see that's happening now
[36:37] they're headed back to Egypt God never
[36:39] wants you to go backwards we're supposed
[36:43] to see what happens in the past bring it
[36:45] to a present-day truth amen
[36:49] that's great what happened to that
[36:50] Pentecost wonderful
[36:52] that was for 120 in the Upper Room but
[36:56] what about today what about this revival
[37:00] that we should be under today
[37:02] let's read Hosea 6 and 1 well they're 6
[37:10] and 1 watch come and let us return unto
[37:12] the Lord for he hath torn and he will
[37:15] heal us
[37:16] he hath smitten and he will bind us up
[37:19] after two days will he revived us what
[37:23] is the date of God a thousand years as a
[37:26] day in the day as a thousand years so
[37:28] after two thousand years God is going to
[37:31] revive us now we know there's been
[37:33] revivals all down through the ages but
[37:35] there's got to be one after two days in
[37:40] the third day he will raise us up and we
[37:43] shall live in his sight that means God
[37:47] here that means God's here will live in
[37:51] his sight you got that same man now
[37:54] listen to this let's go to some of you
[37:56] that have your quotes in your hand
[37:57] these were inserted so you won't have
[37:59] them you got to read them up here go to
[38:01] number a we're going to talk about a lot
[38:04] of revivals but then we've got when we
[38:06] talk about a lot of revivals we've got
[38:08] to come up to the present day revival
[38:11] alright which will be a couple of
[38:13] messages down the road now watch what
[38:15] brother Branham said this is Dennis
[38:17] rising of the Sun 1965 there was the
[38:20] first sheaf come up from all the
[38:22] prophets which was the son of God the
[38:24] king of all prophets look at this here's
[38:26] my point there has been churches
[38:28] churches Brides Brides churches listen
[38:32] he said brides
[38:35] brides churches churches brides bride
[38:39] churches brides brides all the way for
[38:43] two thousand years gods had churches and
[38:44] he's had brides but there has got to
[38:47] come one hallelujah there has to come a
[38:52] real bride not saying that other bride
[38:54] was false they had their time they had
[38:58] their box but that was during that two
[39:01] days they weren't in the third day you
[39:05] and I are in the third day but there's
[39:09] got to come one there has to come a real
[39:13] bride there must come one that's not
[39:15] only got the mechanics but the dynamics
[39:18] of it makes that church die oh this
[39:25] makes that church live moving the power
[39:29] of his resurrection until we come to
[39:32] that place until we find that place what
[39:35] good does it do to polish the hubs let
[39:41] me insert something you know what he's
[39:42] saying what is what good does it do to
[39:44] think the clouds wrong or the dates are
[39:46] wrong we're polishing hubs
[39:49] we're polishing hubs I don't care I'm
[39:53] like brother Dale I do I care the
[39:57] property God gave me an open book to God
[40:00] Himself that's what the children of
[40:05] Israel they oh we got a clown we got
[40:08] some father God reign Manor down out of
[40:10] heaven and they still said God what he
[40:13] be done for us that's what's happening
[40:15] now God what have you done for us he
[40:18] sent you everything you needed what good
[40:22] does he do to polish the hubs
[40:24] what does it does it do good does it do
[40:28] to give her a facelift and some of you
[40:30] young people don't know what a simonize
[40:32] job is who knows what a simonize job is
[40:36] not many Simon eyes was a car wax and
[40:41] you had to literally get out there and
[40:43] do this you ain't kidding
[40:48] and then you had to wait until it dry
[40:50] I'm telling you this for a story you
[40:51] have to wait till it to dry and then if
[40:55] you miss the spot you're in trouble cuz
[40:57] it showed up what good does it do to
[41:02] give it a facelift or just shine the car
[41:07] the car is the message that's the
[41:10] vehicle to get us out of here okay
[41:13] I don't it doesn't matter to me like I
[41:15] said I know one thing's for sure that
[41:18] sign if you can see Christ in that sign
[41:21] it's a sign not to be denied no matter
[41:27] how much the mechanics proves to be
[41:30] right there has got to be dynamics to
[41:33] make it work everybody got that same man
[41:36] now watch this next quote 1965 go to
[41:40] this evil age you won't have it on your
[41:41] notes this would be number B I picked
[41:43] these up while I was in and now watch
[41:47] this right here now watch what brother
[41:49] Brown says and garter this evil ways now
[41:51] that kind of listen go to this evil age
[41:54] and the northern ones at the end time
[41:55] I'm gonna add that to it you should
[41:57] listen to that tape or read that book
[42:00] also because go to this evil agent or no
[42:02] one's the endtime kind of go together
[42:03] alright because who is godless evil age
[42:06] then or anyone's at the end time
[42:08] amen it is now watch it is that both
[42:11] engaged brides
[42:15] believe Satan's knowledge against God's
[42:18] Word that's why I'm telling you folks
[42:20] when we get finished it's got to be a
[42:21] word revival not a revival of emotion
[42:26] and that feels good
[42:28] Egypt felt pretty good I mean Israel
[42:30] felt pretty good when they come out of
[42:31] Egypt but what in that long journey they
[42:35] started murmuring and complaining in
[42:41] this long 50 years since the Prophet
[42:44] left they now start murmuring and
[42:48] complaining and forget what God did for
[42:51] them already but we got to be
[42:53] established in the present day truth
[42:57] the bride of Adam believe Satan's
[43:01] knowledge against God's Word and the
[43:04] Bride of Christ I'm gonna give her we um
[43:10] I want you to look at my backside the
[43:13] bride of Adam believes Saint not look
[43:14] and the Bride of Christ has believed
[43:18] Satan's knowledge look how close he
[43:24] didn't say the bride of the devil
[43:26] he said the Bride of Christ has believed
[43:30] Satan's knowledge I like what brother
[43:34] olltii said he said science and God are
[43:36] contrary God's the greatest scientist
[43:39] who ever was but man scientific learning
[43:42] is contrary to God amen so whatever they
[43:46] can scientifically prove about all this
[43:48] clouds to forget it it's Satan's
[43:51] knowledge look in this intellectual evil
[43:55] age against God's Word and notice even
[44:01] the natural that believed it and plunged
[44:04] the whole human race to death the
[44:07] natural bride Adam the natural man of
[44:10] the earth his bride before he got to her
[44:13] to be wife plunged the whole human race
[44:16] into death whether it's scientific or
[44:19] not we die just the same because God
[44:23] said we would whether you're in holy
[44:27] eating o Lord we fixin good clothes our
[44:31] Holy Church our holy denomination or
[44:34] whatever it might be you'll die the day
[44:38] you disbelieve one word of God's Word to
[44:42] be the truth one word when it's
[44:46] vindicated and proved to you that's the
[44:50] day that's why they told Jesus they said
[44:53] they said all these people you know got
[44:55] man in the wilderness and Jesus looked
[44:58] at him and said there everyone did their
[45:01] everyone dad and brother Bram said
[45:03] that's eternally separated from God
[45:04] there everyone dad why they turn to word
[45:07] down
[45:09] when it was vindicated and proved to him
[45:11] when this message has been vindicated
[45:13] and proved to its over and over and over
[45:16] again they denied that's the day you
[45:20] separate yourself from God not just the
[45:24] whole sentence one word whosoever shall
[45:28] add one word or take one away that's the
[45:30] day you die and you know what remember
[45:35] brother Brown said he thought she got
[45:36] away with it because she didn't die that
[45:38] day but God said hey you're not gonna
[45:42] live a thousand years right Methuselah
[45:46] lived 969 years you're not gonna live
[45:47] that day amen that's why we're gonna
[45:50] have a millennium where there'll be a
[45:51] thousand years well everyone will live
[45:54] that day that thousand years to prove
[45:57] that that curse had been took away look
[46:00] what he says whether you're in Holy Eden
[46:04] message our Holy Church our holy
[46:09] denomination or whatever it might be
[46:12] you'll die the day you disbelieve one
[46:15] word of God's word to be true that's why
[46:21] it's got to come back to a word revival
[46:23] they bring Brides brides churches
[46:25] they've had revivals since Israel came
[46:29] out of Egypt but there's going to come
[46:32] one that's going to take this word and
[46:36] stand on it regardless if this church
[46:39] physical falls apart so what
[46:45] thank God he gave us a prophet a
[46:49] vindicated prophet yeah I'll clap too
[46:52] [Applause]
[46:55] because he didn't point us to him he
[46:58] pointed us to Christ and that's good
[47:01] enough for me cuz all the others they
[47:03] point to their self most of the time
[47:05] amen
[47:08] y'all want to have a little something
[47:10] here you know we in 2017 we we spoke
[47:13] about the year 2019 which is coming to
[47:16] an end and I never said the rapture was
[47:17] gonna take place but I told y'all
[47:19] something would happen in 2019 actually
[47:23] I told you in October 2019 well that's
[47:26] when they started turning this word down
[47:28] the big people did started turning the
[47:31] message down and started going away
[47:35] listen let me tell you something it
[47:39] never deterred Joshua and Caleb one time
[47:43] when Caleb when Caleb come out of 40
[47:46] years of listening to that junk
[47:48] Caleb stood and says give me my Mountain
[47:52] I am as strong today as I was when you
[47:57] told me 40 years ago I was gonna come
[47:59] into this promised land Oh Lord that
[48:02] made him 80 years old I taught to make
[48:04] y'all happy your older ones well the
[48:08] deal will be 80 this year so he's Caleb
[48:10] Caleb taking over the mountain amen all
[48:14] right now look let's talk for just a
[48:15] minute about this revival number one the
[48:19] deity of Jesus Christ now watch this is
[48:22] the prayer we read these last couple
[48:25] weeks ago but I'm gonna say this and I'm
[48:28] not gonna say it again those you that
[48:31] don't come I doubt you watch the
[48:33] services because if you look we see all
[48:36] the views you know there's a beekeeper
[48:39] friend of mine he talks about beekeeping
[48:41] he's got five million viewers he gets
[48:45] 50,000 hits about three hours after he
[48:47] puts a little how to put a bee in a bee
[48:50] box we have the sermons of the Living
[48:54] God
[48:54] and you get 20 views there's more than
[48:58] 20 of you kids sitting in here today I'm
[49:01] telling you it's just shame
[49:03] and I'm saying it from brother Russ
[49:05] dunker he called me the other day said
[49:07] it's a cry
[49:07] and shame that your people can't watch
[49:09] those sermons and you get 20 views and
[49:12] all these other people on YouTube get
[49:13] millions thousands hundreds as soon as
[49:16] they put something on why you know what
[49:18] the Word of God is not popular but we
[49:25] review because we know that's going to
[49:26] happen and I'm just reviewing life's
[49:28] Wednesday sermon so if you didn't watch
[49:31] it which probably didn't because there's
[49:32] only about 30 views on it then we're
[49:34] going to redo it again so you can pay
[49:36] attention watch this is brother Browns
[49:42] prayer and now this is the 1949 and now
[49:47] start a revival in the hearts of the
[49:50] people this morning Lord may this be a
[49:53] renewing time we're coming into 2020 a
[49:56] new a new decade not a century sorry I
[50:02] said century the other day a new decade
[50:04] there's no more 2001 t10 we're in 2020
[50:11] come into a new decade a new renew at a
[50:15] time when the Spirit will be renewed you
[50:18] look at all the preachers we've had in
[50:20] business in for the past three or four
[50:22] times we're all on the same page and I'm
[50:26] telling you we're going to see that
[50:27] because brother Brown said the Holy
[50:29] Ghost would have not have fallen would
[50:32] not have fallen on the day of Pentecost
[50:34] if they hadn't been in one mind and one
[50:36] Accord one one setting over going well I
[50:41] think that thing that cloud over Jesus's
[50:43] head I don't know if that was you know
[50:45] John Peter James and John said Wilbur
[50:47] and go I I was there on top of that
[50:49] mountain but I saw something but I
[50:51] didn't see Jesus glorified I saw this
[50:53] and I saw come on paper good grief they
[50:56] were in one mind in one Accord Jesus
[50:58] told them what to do and they did it
[50:59] they went up to an upper room of course
[51:00] it was scared to death they didn't know
[51:02] what was going on but boy when the Holy
[51:04] Ghost fell that's our problem I think
[51:07] the problem was the mixed multitude in
[51:09] Israel it wasn't all so much Israel and
[51:12] now start a revival in the hearts of the
[51:14] people this morning I'll make a coming
[51:16] here in just a minute
[51:16] may this be a renewing time a time when
[51:19] the Spirit will be renewed
[51:21] I know Father we pray it this way come
[51:23] get us by the hand look how personal
[51:25] this is each one of us and walk us down
[51:29] this Lane here in other words walk us
[51:31] down this journey that we're on show us
[51:34] show to us this great picture that said
[51:37] in order here revealing your secrets to
[51:40] the Saints hearts this morning
[51:42] that's 1949 he hadn't even started his
[51:44] message yet amen and as we walk down
[51:49] Lord then Lord in the armor of God may
[51:53] we go as gallant soldiers to face the
[51:55] enemy but how could we face him unless
[51:58] we know his tactics and help us this
[52:01] morning to understand and show us the
[52:03] his foreground there so we'll know where
[52:06] to meet him for we ask it in Jesus name
[52:09] Amen what a what a prayer now let's go
[52:13] to number 2 this is this is from 1951
[52:20] the angel of the Lord Toledo Ohio and
[52:22] when we see these crowds gathering that
[52:24] doesn't mean revival that's just the
[52:27] gathering all right so we're not looking
[52:31] I want to fill this church up it's
[52:33] almost full now but it's not a filling
[52:37] up of church it's filling up for the
[52:39] people it's already in the church that's
[52:44] just a gathering but a revival is when
[52:46] people get really right with God and
[52:48] pray through and starts a revival
[52:51] throughout the city and everything you
[52:53] see they put away sin put away their
[52:55] iniquity and turn to God turn around and
[52:58] start back again down the road alright
[53:00] let's go to number three brother I feel
[53:03] real good resurrection of lives of 1951
[53:05] I'd feel good about it anyhow what this
[53:08] church needs today is a good revival not
[53:11] a new doctrine we don't need a new
[53:14] doctrine we got the truth a new order
[53:20] just the stirring up of what you already
[53:23] know about
[53:25] Hey number four expectations 1961 now a
[53:32] minister cannot bring a revival number
[53:36] four now a minister cannot bring a
[53:39] revival like I said I can stand here and
[53:41] go art bro John you need to sing all the
[53:43] songs that are up-tempo brother Lewis
[53:46] you need to sing all the songs that are
[53:48] up-tempo I want you to go out there and
[53:49] run the aisles and while most of y'all
[53:51] would probably be back next service but
[53:54] you know that's not what you say well
[53:57] what you you're trying to bring a
[53:58] revival I'm not trying to work anything
[54:00] up you're gonna have to do that I mean
[54:04] listen if some of y'all raise both hands
[54:07] it takin anointing probably being gay to
[54:11] get you to raise your hands I'm serious
[54:17] let me sit down like a bump on a pickle
[54:20] this is the greatest thing everyone's in
[54:22] the face of the earth you just sit there
[54:25] say any man every once in a while most
[54:29] of you ain't men like this and that's
[54:32] okay but let it know how to labor once
[54:34] in a while there's no preacher can bring
[54:38] a revival now see that's all across the
[54:40] land back when how did you interpret
[54:43] that Lewis when you come back into the
[54:45] land you look out in the land you see
[54:47] all the preachers trying to create a
[54:49] revival I told you we were looking there
[54:52] brother Summerall back in the 70s I
[54:55] think he was calling for a revival
[54:57] because they he said they'd never been
[54:59] one now see brother brandman just went
[55:01] off the same greatest healing revival
[55:02] there ever was and he had to be there
[55:05] and know about it because he was in his
[55:07] 70s or so in 1970 something but he's
[55:10] calling for a revival now that's okay to
[55:12] call for a revival we have revivals you
[55:15] know the the Methodists and the Baptist
[55:17] they'll have every year they'll have a
[55:18] revival what's their revival their
[55:21] revival is to get more church members
[55:23] because they can't revive people under a
[55:26] whole Iike under of Father Son Holy
[55:27] Ghost baptism they can't revive their
[55:30] self they keep being revived I'm a
[55:33] Reaper the brother said that's the
[55:34] problem
[55:35] denominations God cannot start a revival
[55:37] in a denomination
[55:39] you got to have a word revival you got
[55:42] to have the word just make sense you got
[55:47] to have the word you got to have it
[55:48] lined up right number four now Minister
[55:56] cannot bring a revival
[55:57] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[55:59] he doesn't pack it with him that's in my
[56:04] unique situation is I'm a minister but
[56:06] I'm also Lansing so I can try to create
[56:10] a revival inside of me same way with you
[56:14] brother they'll ever call up and the
[56:17] only thing he can do is just be loyal to
[56:19] God in His Word and I think we have and
[56:21] the revival has to come by the people in
[56:24] your home in your life now revival isn't
[56:30] adding new members to the church its
[56:32] reviving that what you've already got to
[56:36] revive means to bring back everybody got
[56:40] that same man now listen this room
[56:43] number five leave us out this 1951 what
[56:50] we need today is an old-fashioned gun
[56:52] set God sent revival clean up the home
[56:55] start in your house
[56:57] start in your house start in your house
[56:59] physical and then this house clean up
[57:03] the heart get things ready start a
[57:07] revival in your home and it'll begin its
[57:09] church preacher don't bring it in his
[57:14] briefcase so don't blame me and brother
[57:17] Dale because there's not a revival ha
[57:21] it's your fault but we're gonna do
[57:24] everything we can to get you in line God
[57:27] gets you in line where you can have a
[57:29] revival God sends it from heaven to the
[57:33] individual all right so that's why I say
[57:37] that the world is out there looking and
[57:39] they're gonna get it they're going to
[57:40] get an anointing just like brother Dale
[57:42] said I'll pour out my spirit upon all
[57:44] flesh everybody's gonna get into this
[57:46] great rushing revival I'm Eve you
[57:50] remember how many times I've preached
[57:52] and
[57:52] told you and look how close this getting
[57:55] now there's somebody gonna raise up in
[57:58] this message I said in this message this
[58:01] is gonna have a healing campaign and all
[58:03] the signs and wonders but be off and his
[58:05] doctrine and people are gonna flock to
[58:07] him like you would not believe because
[58:10] that's anointed once if he's faults in
[58:14] this doctrine while his brother Dale
[58:15] keep reading that scripture if a prophet
[58:19] prophesy and it come to pass believing
[58:22] but if a prophet prophesized and it
[58:24] comes to pass but he takes you to
[58:26] another god now see that's anti word
[58:29] what is there's only one God if he takes
[58:32] you to another god that's anti then you
[58:36] don't believe him
[58:37] doesn't matter about the signs and
[58:38] wonders preacher don't bringing in his
[58:42] briefcase God sends you from heaven to
[58:43] the individual that's true alright let's
[58:46] read number six Elisha the prophet
[58:49] mothers of old they love to raise
[58:51] children but all this modern American
[58:54] day that we're living in now I tell you
[58:55] our nation is simply polluted there's
[58:59] not a hope left to this nation as I see
[59:01] only an old-fashioned revival and
[59:04] according to the scripture it'll never
[59:06] be nationwide now listen brother Brown
[59:09] is a prophet I don't like to say brother
[59:11] I'm was a prophet he still is a problem
[59:13] he's still prophet okay
[59:16] so brother Branham is the prophet of the
[59:18] end time we gotta believe what he said
[59:21] there's no hope left to this nation as I
[59:24] see only an old-fashioned revival and
[59:26] then he stops and he says and according
[59:29] to the scripture it'll never be
[59:30] nationwide so don't worry about a
[59:33] nationwide revival don't worry about it
[59:36] breaking out in so-and-so's message
[59:38] church over here you got this messy
[59:40] church right here that we deal with
[59:43] it'll never be nationwide so then we're
[59:45] just left it'll be a revival among the
[59:49] people now watch what he said comma the
[59:52] elect of God but it won't be a real
[59:56] sweeping revival take the whole nation
[59:59] then never was never will be okay so
[1:00:03] don't worry about a world
[1:00:05] revival brother Brown said what about
[1:00:06] the third police it won't be a public
[1:00:08] show so now let's read number seven now
[1:00:13] watch this it's on third seal now watch
[1:00:16] today the reason that revivals were
[1:00:17] supposed to have we've had
[1:00:19] denominational revivals but it can't be
[1:00:23] a word revival okay we have
[1:00:26] denominational revivals we haven't had
[1:00:29] we we haven't had a real stirring no no
[1:00:33] no no no sir don't think we got revivals
[1:00:38] we have it now this is 1963 the opening
[1:00:41] of the seals greatest revival ever
[1:00:43] struck the earth but it was a word
[1:00:45] revival that was so simple so hid nobody
[1:00:49] understood it at that time remember on
[1:00:52] the sixth seal he said it's gone from
[1:00:53] us-- not for you men don't think we got
[1:00:58] revivals we haven't oh they've got
[1:01:00] millions and millions and millions of
[1:01:02] church members I say we got millions and
[1:01:04] millions and millions of so-called
[1:01:06] message believers but not a revival know
[1:01:09] where the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[1:01:17] there's been no revival there no
[1:01:20] manifest sensation of God to stir the
[1:01:22] bride yet we're looking for it it will
[1:01:26] take those seven unknown thunders back
[1:01:28] there to wake her up again you say well
[1:01:30] brother you fish didn't get deep plan of
[1:01:33] redemption how can you get away from the
[1:01:36] plan of redemption how many tell I
[1:01:37] preached a year and a four months on the
[1:01:40] seals to show you the plan of redemption
[1:01:42] that's the thunders
[1:01:46] to wake her up again he will send it he
[1:01:50] promised it now that's dust authority he
[1:01:55] will send it he promised it and then I
[1:01:59] say it's today everybody got then say
[1:02:03] Amen
[1:02:04] now look and we'll give you a reason
[1:02:07] right here and then we're gonna read
[1:02:08] Genesis let's go to number eight now
[1:02:14] look what brother Brown was doing in
[1:02:19] ninety since 1948 he's in the Christian
[1:02:23] businessmen's Association watch but if
[1:02:27] all the Full Gospel people would come
[1:02:29] one heart in one Accord now this is 1948
[1:02:32] in 1906 on the zuzo Street God poured
[1:02:35] out the Holy Ghost on the people right
[1:02:38] the Holy Ghost himself coming in the
[1:02:40] fullness of the baptism to give them
[1:02:42] signs and wonders and to give them a
[1:02:44] healing campaign amen so this is 1948
[1:02:47] brother Branham is beginning starting
[1:02:48] into the healing campaign of his message
[1:02:50] but that part
[1:02:51] remember he does two things remember
[1:02:55] Malachi 4 does two things turn the
[1:02:58] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:03:00] hey my children to the father's back
[1:03:02] back four children to the father's for
[1:03:04] us and then he brings a message of the
[1:03:07] seven thunders or the opening of the
[1:03:08] seals alright so he's not there yet he's
[1:03:10] 1948 he's bringing a revival a healing
[1:03:14] revival I told you before the reason
[1:03:19] that revival came and I'll read
[1:03:21] something because you have to look at
[1:03:23] the characteristics of a revival so
[1:03:25] we're gonna look at several revivals I
[1:03:27] want you to see the characteristic of
[1:03:29] how God starts them through the people
[1:03:32] and then how they end
[1:03:34] now listen ours is not going to end ours
[1:03:37] and it is an eternal revival I hope you
[1:03:39] get that cause if it's a word revival it
[1:03:42] can't go away the word is forever
[1:03:45] eternal so when we begin into this word
[1:03:47] revival that's what's going to take us
[1:03:49] through the body change right through
[1:03:51] the resurrection body change take us all
[1:03:53] over into the another dimension until
[1:03:57] God cleans this place off
[1:03:58] then we're gonna come right back here
[1:04:00] for a thousand years on a honeymoon then
[1:04:02] we're gonna go back out again dogs gonna
[1:04:04] wipe this thing off and then we're gonna
[1:04:05] live in a future home but it starts
[1:04:08] today
[1:04:10] it started the day you receive the new
[1:04:13] birth but now what do you say brother
[1:04:15] wait we got to revive that new birth
[1:04:17] again being born again but if all the
[1:04:26] Full Gospel people would come one heart
[1:04:28] and one Accord now here's the problem
[1:04:30] we've had for 50 years there would be a
[1:04:35] revival that would shake the whole world
[1:04:37] and every spiritual gift would be in the
[1:04:40] church within an hour after it took
[1:04:46] place signs and wonders that was done by
[1:04:50] the Apostles would be a minor thing -
[1:04:55] what would do if we could just get the
[1:04:57] church together one thing it's got to
[1:05:03] happen it will happen it maybe after I
[1:05:07] passed off the same but I want to put my
[1:05:10] word in this that you might know that my
[1:05:12] voice is this old Christian people bind
[1:05:15] yourself together with one heart and one
[1:05:19] Accord watch this for God cannot send
[1:05:23] everybody says well God why aren't you
[1:05:26] sending a gift why you're not sending it
[1:05:27] here's the answer God cannot no more
[1:05:31] send the gifts to the church while the
[1:05:33] church is separated then he can send the
[1:05:37] Holy Ghost unless you're in one Accord
[1:05:39] that's right for it comes by the Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost believe it let me read you one
[1:05:45] more listen to this one number nine the
[1:05:50] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:05:51] Saints
[1:05:52] I think there's nowhere nineteen forty
[1:05:53] eight and fifty that's the reason we
[1:05:56] can't have a revival you got to get back
[1:05:59] to God's faith again in the Bible what's
[1:06:02] happening today they're tearing it apart
[1:06:04] what's happening in the message there's
[1:06:07] message churches on each corner in
[1:06:09] certain places and they don't even speak
[1:06:11] to each other how
[1:06:12] can God work in that he can't it's a
[1:06:17] separation that's been the problem and
[1:06:21] I'll say something in a minute and you
[1:06:23] don't know like it but I'm gonna say it
[1:06:24] anyway you've got to get back to God's
[1:06:25] faith again in the Bible where men and
[1:06:27] women become born-again and regenerated
[1:06:31] by the Holy Ghost then that man can't
[1:06:34] help from being a Christian he's a
[1:06:36] Christian by birth that's right you
[1:06:38] don't have to pledge him please come to
[1:06:42] church machine paid time you don't have
[1:06:45] to pledge him and give him cards and
[1:06:47] visit him Oh Lord oh Lord if he's born
[1:06:53] again brother you almost have to this is
[1:06:56] worse gonna hurt some of you you almost
[1:06:58] have to borrow the door to keep him out
[1:07:02] now for some of y'all that's not a
[1:07:04] problem you get the cart before the
[1:07:11] horse that's what's the matter you've
[1:07:14] got to get Christ first in the stead of
[1:07:18] the church you got to put Christ first
[1:07:20] that's what we need today that's what
[1:07:23] America needs what the whole nation the
[1:07:25] whole world needs today is an
[1:07:26] old-fashioned revival stirring God sent
[1:07:28] revival but remember there's no
[1:07:30] nationwide revival that's going to start
[1:07:32] inside of you but what was the problem
[1:07:34] in these two quotes there was one
[1:07:35] problem in both quotes separation
[1:07:39] separation this church can't stand that
[1:07:42] church this church can't stand that
[1:07:44] church this church I thinking the other
[1:07:46] day I thought God this is the worst
[1:07:49] thing I could think but I'm gonna
[1:07:50] thinking anyway you go to these big
[1:07:52] meetings six and seven hundred people
[1:07:53] and brother would be one time a long
[1:07:56] time ago before he died he told brother
[1:07:58] Richard Wilson he looked into ministers
[1:08:00] meeting we had about 60 ministers up
[1:08:02] there in North Carolina he looked around
[1:08:03] he said wonder how many different
[1:08:05] opinions are in this building now folks
[1:08:11] that ain't right there's only one truth
[1:08:17] it's like somebody said to the day
[1:08:19] brother right you both can't be right
[1:08:23] either one wrong and one right or
[1:08:26] from you can't be what both of you the
[1:08:28] right not right
[1:08:31] you can't not in the Word of God and
[1:08:34] Jesus had no division him and the father
[1:08:36] were one and what did he say in John 17
[1:08:40] I pray father that they be one as we are
[1:08:44] one if you have the mind of Christ you
[1:08:50] can't bring the false denomination you
[1:08:52] can't bring the false word you can't
[1:08:54] bring your opinion that's been our
[1:08:57] problem in the message for 50 years we
[1:08:59] are so divided thank god he's bending
[1:09:03] the ranks sorry but thank God he's
[1:09:08] thinning the rain twenty hundred doing
[1:09:11] the Old Testament he had to let all the
[1:09:14] fighters die I'm sorry
[1:09:19] what's the truth thank God he's standing
[1:09:25] the roads cuz we sat in churches 600
[1:09:29] people none I told my brother Donny
[1:09:30] Reagan okay I'm not talking about him I
[1:09:31] don't mind special meetings we have
[1:09:33] you've got all these different opinions
[1:09:36] they're not all in agreement
[1:09:38] I hate when the preacher says no we've
[1:09:42] been on the green all things why that
[1:09:47] shirt Paul and Peter but it wasn't
[1:09:51] doctrinal it was behavior it was not a
[1:09:56] doctrinal issue Peter didn't poll didn't
[1:09:58] say now Peter you're not preaching the
[1:10:00] right word no Peter had a problem with
[1:10:03] something he was doing of his own
[1:10:05] opinion but not in the word because God
[1:10:10] used Peter to rock the word just as he
[1:10:14] used Paul to write the word alright so
[1:10:17] we may have our personal differences
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:23] as everybody in here thinks it somebody
[1:10:26] else ought to be preaching today
[1:10:33] my baby I fly said I that don't matter
[1:10:37] to me
[1:10:38] that's personal issues but if I tell you
[1:10:42] the truth you gotta say Amen
[1:10:45] well bride will say Amen but there's too
[1:10:51] many I hate to say that but fear not
[1:10:55] little black I hate to see people fall
[1:11:01] by the wayside but I'm ready to go home
[1:11:04] I'm like Caleb I've come to this journey
[1:11:07] enough I've seen all that behind me
[1:11:10] there's too many people following this
[1:11:14] message
[1:11:15] I said following there's a difference in
[1:11:20] following and being the message Moses
[1:11:24] was the message and the messenger Joshua
[1:11:28] and Caleb became when Moses left Joshua
[1:11:33] and Caleb became the message of the hour
[1:11:37] and Joshua was the type of the Holy
[1:11:40] Ghost
[1:11:41] brother Bram said Caleb was the top of
[1:11:43] the believer believer not mate believer
[1:11:47] not unbeliever but true believer that's
[1:11:52] been our problem we've been too
[1:11:54] separated bind yourself together with
[1:11:58] one heart and one Accord all these
[1:12:02] things that are going on in this message
[1:12:04] should not bother you except for the
[1:12:06] personal people you know you feel for
[1:12:08] them but you're not gonna go out there
[1:12:11] to folks you can't do that you can't
[1:12:15] sympathize you can call the brother and
[1:12:18] say god bless you brother you still my
[1:12:19] brother I'm praying for you but I can't
[1:12:23] go with what you're doing and you know
[1:12:26] what that's the way you should do cuz
[1:12:32] watch
[1:12:33] Genesis 15 15 God said to Abram know of
[1:12:40] a surety that thy seed shall be a
[1:12:42] stranger in a land that's not ours hello
[1:12:47] somebody is that not us sure this land
[1:12:51] is ours but we got a squatter on it
[1:12:53] we got a squatter on this land that we
[1:12:56] got to deal with now watch thy seed
[1:13:00] shall be a stranger in a land that is
[1:13:01] not theirs and shall serve them and they
[1:13:05] shall afflict them for hundred years
[1:13:09] remember it was actually 430 God give
[1:13:11] them a little grace but it was 400 it
[1:13:13] took 400 years you know it's kind of
[1:13:16] like the old analogy if you want to
[1:13:17] you're supposed to boil lobsters when
[1:13:20] they're alive and you're supposed to
[1:13:21] boil we frogs you can't just throw a
[1:13:27] frog in a pot and it boiling it would
[1:13:29] jump out I've seen lobsters do it I've
[1:13:32] seen them they'll crawl up to the top
[1:13:34] and trying to get out why water's hot
[1:13:35] but if you'll just sit there and go from
[1:13:37] low - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 in about 30
[1:13:43] minutes they think they're in this real
[1:13:45] warm environment but they're getting
[1:13:47] their goose cooked and they'll die in
[1:13:50] there that's what devil's been doing
[1:13:51] folks he's been turning up just a little
[1:13:54] bit of the heat just a little at a time
[1:13:56] 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years 50
[1:14:00] years and he has killed good people I'm
[1:14:06] not kicking people out of the message
[1:14:07] I'm telling you some people are talking
[1:14:09] it we probably the other day when you
[1:14:11] have a battle when Israel went to battle
[1:14:13] and not before but when Israel went to
[1:14:15] battle later on they lost good men
[1:14:18] because it was a battle we've lost good
[1:14:21] men because this is a battle but what do
[1:14:25] you do you don't go back to get that man
[1:14:28] if he's gone he's gone
[1:14:30] what'd you do you press on and fight the
[1:14:32] thing that killed him that's what you
[1:14:35] got to do you got to fight the thing
[1:14:36] that killed him
[1:14:39] so that's what we're doing now we're
[1:14:42] fighting the thing is killed all of our
[1:14:43] brothers and sisters down to the 50
[1:14:45] years
[1:14:48] but we can't be separated we can't have
[1:14:51] 15 different ways to preached in your
[1:14:53] birth Jesus didn't if it's ji if this is
[1:14:58] Jesus's message why can't we get it
[1:15:00] right because we know a lot of people
[1:15:04] don't have the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:15:05] problem because what the Holy Ghost
[1:15:09] what'd he tell you in the Bible the Holy
[1:15:12] Ghost would lead you and guide you into
[1:15:15] some truth that's not what the Bible
[1:15:17] said he said he would lead you and guide
[1:15:20] you into all truth and then that's why
[1:15:24] we come from the east and the West in
[1:15:25] different places that's why you see
[1:15:27] people jockeying around trying to find
[1:15:29] places go to church why true brides
[1:15:32] gonna get fed they're gonna find a place
[1:15:34] to get fed and then so Genesis 15 watch
[1:15:38] and also that in that 400 years 400
[1:15:41] years and also that nation whom they
[1:15:45] shall serve will I judge remember when
[1:15:48] they left to Egypt Egypt was devastated
[1:15:51] I mean when we leave this world guess
[1:15:54] what this world system is going to be
[1:15:57] devastating and afterwards shall they
[1:16:00] come out with a great substance now
[1:16:04] let's go to eggs of this one we'll read
[1:16:06] this right here and then we'll continue
[1:16:08] this afternoon if that's all right this
[1:16:15] is one of the first revivals mentioned
[1:16:17] in the Bible because remember when
[1:16:19] Israel came out of Egypt they were still
[1:16:21] Israelites when they were in Egypt they
[1:16:23] didn't become different people so God
[1:16:26] stirred up what was already the promise
[1:16:28] that was given them by Abram to Abram
[1:16:31] that you're gonna sojourn here for 400
[1:16:34] years you're gonna walk in a strange
[1:16:36] land but I'm gonna bring you out with a
[1:16:38] mighty hand and I'm going to destroy
[1:16:42] that country that held you captive when
[1:16:45] are we gonna start believing that and
[1:16:47] the children of Israel were fruitful and
[1:16:49] increased abundantly and multiplied and
[1:16:53] waxed exceeding mighty and the land was
[1:16:56] filled with them all these
[1:16:59] she's believed was running around now
[1:17:05] there rose up a new king over Egypt who
[1:17:08] knew not Joseph and he said unto his
[1:17:12] people behold the people of the children
[1:17:13] of Israel are more in mightier than we
[1:17:16] in other words the Pharaoh looked out
[1:17:20] there and said man there's more of them
[1:17:21] than there are of us we got to do
[1:17:23] something because they could cause an
[1:17:25] insurrection they could raise up and
[1:17:27] take us over and he saying this vote
[1:17:30] behold the people children of Israel
[1:17:32] more and mightier than the weak come on
[1:17:33] let us deal wisely with them the devil
[1:17:36] is not gonna do anything
[1:17:37] usually stupid he's pretty wise okay
[1:17:41] come on let us deal wisely with them
[1:17:44] lest they multiply and it come to pass
[1:17:46] that when their fathers out any war they
[1:17:49] joined also our enemies and fight
[1:17:51] against us and so get them up out of the
[1:17:54] land so now what he's saying is and just
[1:17:57] to be blunt what he's saying is I'm not
[1:17:59] just gonna go out there and tell them to
[1:18:01] quit having kids cuz they'll rebel but
[1:18:06] I'm just gonna make them work so hard
[1:18:08] till they're so tired they eat supper
[1:18:11] and go to bed and sleep all right now
[1:18:15] I'm really that's truthful what he's
[1:18:16] doing he's subtly trying to get them to
[1:18:19] quit having children
[1:18:20] what's the devil doing he's subtly
[1:18:25] trying to keep people children of God
[1:18:27] from being born again for 50 years he's
[1:18:31] put us in a message church and said
[1:18:33] you're fine don't you feel it
[1:18:42] therefore they did set over them
[1:18:45] taskmaster to afflict them with their
[1:18:47] burdens and they built for pharaoh two
[1:18:50] cities he put them to work and then what
[1:18:54] works works don't cut your hair women
[1:18:59] but make sure you wear your dress and
[1:19:01] make sure it's like three inches below
[1:19:02] your your knees and don't wear no slips
[1:19:06] that are over eight inches we went
[1:19:08] through all that that didn't save nobody
[1:19:11] zero people did it's a zero
[1:19:15] it was just works prove me wrong you
[1:19:22] tell me all the people that's come in
[1:19:24] and then left this message and didn't
[1:19:25] have a new birth they just came in and
[1:19:27] didn't cut their hair and they wore
[1:19:28] their dresses and now they're
[1:19:30] eventually somewhere they went off you
[1:19:34] get the baptism the Holy Ghost you won't
[1:19:35] ever ladies put on a pair of pants you
[1:19:37] won't ever cut your hair you won't ever
[1:19:39] wear makeup ever so that's why the
[1:19:44] problem is is not many too many new
[1:19:47] birth
[1:19:47] that's what brother Bram said and now in
[1:19:50] the message has taught seventeen
[1:19:51] different ways therefore they did not
[1:19:57] set over them they sorry they did set
[1:19:59] over them taskmaster to afflict them
[1:20:01] with burdens and they built for pharaoh
[1:20:03] treasure cities those two cities but the
[1:20:05] more they afflicted them the more they
[1:20:08] multiplied and grew and they were
[1:20:10] grieved because of the children of
[1:20:12] Israel and the Egyptians made the
[1:20:15] children of Israel to serve with rigor
[1:20:17] and they made their lives bitter with
[1:20:20] hard bondage mortar and brick and all
[1:20:23] manner of services in the field and in
[1:20:25] their service wherein they made them
[1:20:27] serve was with rigor in other words for
[1:20:29] four hundred years
[1:20:30] they were just kind of living in Egypt
[1:20:32] doing their thing planting their gardens
[1:20:34] building their house having babies and
[1:20:36] having generations and generation
[1:20:38] all of a sudden Pharaoh said this is
[1:20:41] gonna stop mmm Satan said this is gonna
[1:20:43] stop this too many of them I'm gonna
[1:20:47] thin the ranks
[1:20:50] and the king of Egypt speak to the
[1:20:52] Hebrew midwives now what were we talking
[1:20:54] about last Wednesday night what is a
[1:20:56] midwife a midwife is a person that is
[1:21:01] that their job is is to birth the babies
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:09] what's the preachers job to birth the
[1:21:13] babies to get the babies into the
[1:21:15] kingdom and man so watch what say he eat
[1:21:19] why didn't he go to the leaders I'm
[1:21:23] talking about the big guys he didn't go
[1:21:25] to big guys he went to the preachers
[1:21:27] he's no preacher if you'll not preach
[1:21:30] what here we go and the king of means
[1:21:32] expect to the Hebrew midwives of which
[1:21:33] the name of one was Sephora and the
[1:21:34] other name was pure and he said when you
[1:21:37] do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
[1:21:39] women and see them upon the stool if it
[1:21:42] be a son then you shall kill him kill
[1:21:46] him but if it be a daughter then she
[1:21:50] shall live but the midwives thank God
[1:21:53] feared God and did not as the king of
[1:21:57] Egypt commanded them but save them men
[1:21:59] children alive remember that's the whole
[1:22:01] story by Moses when you come up to moses
[1:22:05] pharaoh said throw all the two-year-old
[1:22:07] babies into the alligators well moses
[1:22:09] was born in between there and the king
[1:22:12] of egypt called for the midwives he
[1:22:14] brought them back any said hey why have
[1:22:17] you done this thing you've saved the
[1:22:18] men's children alive why are you
[1:22:20] preaching the truth getting these babies
[1:22:23] born the Midwife said to Pharaoh because
[1:22:27] the Hebrew women are not as the worldly
[1:22:30] women amen the Hebrew women is not as
[1:22:35] the worldly women bunch a weak bunch of
[1:22:37] people for their lively they go to
[1:22:42] church and they do lift their hands and
[1:22:43] they say hallelujah for they're lively
[1:22:46] they are delivered and the Midwife they
[1:22:49] are not therefore God dealt well with
[1:22:53] the midwives listen God's gonna protect
[1:22:57] the ministry doesn't matter you can't
[1:22:58] say don't put a name to it he's going to
[1:23:00] preserve his ministry he
[1:23:03] going to have a bride as brother Dale
[1:23:04] says the bride this fivefold ministry
[1:23:06] it's there there is a predestinated
[1:23:09] actually there's two oh you didn't know
[1:23:13] God's got a file I mean Satan's got a
[1:23:15] fivefold ministry to remember there's
[1:23:20] twins than ever revival
[1:23:22] if God's got a true fivefold ministry
[1:23:24] Satan's got a false fivefold ministry
[1:23:26] and we see that coming
[1:23:29] therefore God dealt well with the
[1:23:31] midwives and the people multiplied and
[1:23:33] waxed very mighty and it came to pass
[1:23:34] because the midwives feared God then he
[1:23:37] made them houses and pharaoh charged all
[1:23:39] of his people said every son that then
[1:23:41] he went to all the people he didn't just
[1:23:44] worry he's not dealing with preachers
[1:23:46] now he's getting into your hmm every son
[1:23:52] that is born you shall cast him into the
[1:23:54] river and every daughter you shall save
[1:23:56] a life
[1:24:02] God's tried for years to get us to start
[1:24:07] a revival but we've just been so
[1:24:10] separated till we can't there's opinions
[1:24:15] everywhere some do listen to the
[1:24:19] midwives and there are born again some
[1:24:22] don't you can't do it on your own you
[1:24:27] got to have a preacher Amen you got to
[1:24:30] have a minister according to according
[1:24:32] to Ephesians if you want to tear that
[1:24:33] out you can tear it out throw it away if
[1:24:35] you want to but the Bible says if you
[1:24:36] take away from the Word of God guess
[1:24:37] what happens your name is taken off the
[1:24:40] book alright so in the book of Ephesians
[1:24:42] that tells us that it takes apostles
[1:24:43] prophets pastors teachers and
[1:24:44] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[1:24:46] saints in other words to get us to a
[1:24:49] place to get us out of here
[1:24:51] but that revival has to start in you and
[1:24:56] I'm gonna stop right there but I want to
[1:24:58] tell you something you look at all these
[1:25:02] revivals we just talked about a revival
[1:25:04] just a few months ago in Daniel 70 weeks
[1:25:06] we'll read it this afternoon because
[1:25:09] what happened in Israel they went to the
[1:25:13] promised land a man Joshua
[1:25:16] Caleb through through the wilderness
[1:25:19] Moses took him to a place couldn't take
[1:25:21] him over amen
[1:25:23] so Joshua and Caleb took him into the
[1:25:25] Promised Land but they had to fight for
[1:25:26] every inch of ground they had to fight
[1:25:28] fight fight fight fight amen
[1:25:30] but then all of a sudden somebody comes
[1:25:32] in and destroys the whole of Jerusalem
[1:25:34] again toward the temple down
[1:25:37] Nebuchadnezzar come in and tore it all
[1:25:40] down took all the stuff away then you
[1:25:43] see Daniel seven new weeks
[1:25:45] Daniel nine became a revival for the
[1:25:50] Jews Daniel 9:24 will read it this
[1:25:53] afternoon where Daniel didn't just walk
[1:25:56] in and say bless God where Israel we're
[1:26:01] perfect no he spends a whole chapter
[1:26:05] praying for his sin and the sins of the
[1:26:10] people
[1:26:10] Nehemiah finally gets to eat it to do it
[1:26:14] but I'll write I'll read it a minute he
[1:26:15] finally gets the go-ahead to do it but
[1:26:17] the first thing he does he falls on his
[1:26:19] face and says God were sinful people and
[1:26:24] I preached to you for years that we are
[1:26:26] the chosen of God we are God made
[1:26:28] manifest in another form but remember
[1:26:31] one thing we've still got this guy to
[1:26:32] worry with I'm talking about the inside
[1:26:34] guy that inside guy is perfect he's just
[1:26:38] perfect as he'll ever be or he needs
[1:26:40] something else it's that spirit realm
[1:26:43] and the body realm that neat really the
[1:26:45] body really doesn't
[1:26:46] it's the spirit realm the memory reason
[1:26:48] conscience of excellent imagination it's
[1:26:51] not your problem
[1:26:52] that's my problem it's what we think
[1:26:54] reasoning imagination all those
[1:26:58] different things that's our problem but
[1:27:01] please know though that your children of
[1:27:06] Israel not to mix multi to you I want
[1:27:10] you to know that because you cannot call
[1:27:12] for a revival if there's nothing in you
[1:27:15] to revive you can't you've got a call on
[1:27:20] God to save your soul then you can call
[1:27:24] on a revival because if you have sin if
[1:27:27] you have an akin in the camp
[1:27:30] if you have an akin in the camp you got
[1:27:34] to get him out before you can move on
[1:27:37] that's been our problem folks we've been
[1:27:39] scattered
[1:27:40] we've been scattered even under this
[1:27:42] message so many different doctrines and
[1:27:45] ideas do you think we have the correct
[1:27:47] one yeah I do I think we can I think we
[1:27:51] can take the message in the hour and put
[1:27:53] it together I say we I'm talking like
[1:27:55] God do the ministry in this church we
[1:27:57] put it together better than anybody I
[1:27:58] know you remember what brother Michael
[1:28:02] Teague said last Sunday he said it seems
[1:28:06] to people that brother Dale and brother
[1:28:08] Wade are arrogant he said no he said
[1:28:11] they're just established in the present
[1:28:13] day truth
[1:28:14] listen Paul stood up one day and said
[1:28:18] you'll be judged by what I say now that
[1:28:20] would be pretty arrogant if you took it
[1:28:23] the wrong way and I'm sure people did
[1:28:25] you know what people did so who do you
[1:28:27] think here ain't a bishop ain't a
[1:28:31] prophet
[1:28:33] Paul used to persecute us you know he
[1:28:36] used to persecute them people he's in
[1:28:38] now but Paul had a conversion you and I
[1:28:41] need a conversion if you don't have a
[1:28:43] conversion you cannot call for a revival
[1:28:46] you've got a call for a resurrection
[1:28:49] from dead works out of sin in your soul
[1:28:52] then you can be revived in the outside
[1:28:55] man let's stand to our feet this
[1:28:58] afternoon we'll starting in the Book of
[1:29:00] Daniel there but I want you to look at
[1:29:02] these revivals that's there's one we're
[1:29:04] going to go to that well there's about
[1:29:08] five that we're going to talk about this
[1:29:09] afternoon but remember we're heading
[1:29:11] toward a word revival everything has
[1:29:13] always been started by the word
[1:29:14] because what did Abram God told Abram
[1:29:17] you're going to sojourn for 400 years
[1:29:19] that's the word Daniel knew by books
[1:29:23] that Jeremiah said God said through
[1:29:26] Jeremiah that you're going to be seventy
[1:29:28] years in captivity but you're gonna come
[1:29:31] out with a mighty hand you're gonna
[1:29:33] build the wall you're gonna build the
[1:29:35] temple and you're gonna start right back
[1:29:38] into the service like you were before
[1:29:40] that's Daniel 7 new week
[1:29:43] that musicians come had a preacher tell
[1:29:52] him not long ago one of the ones that's
[1:29:58] kind of left the message or we're not
[1:30:01] following it all the way or whatever you
[1:30:03] want to say we were talking about the
[1:30:06] Seventh Seal being open and his comment
[1:30:12] was everybody I know that has said that
[1:30:19] has lived the life of a sinner in other
[1:30:25] words all these people that have come
[1:30:26] forward in the message and said the
[1:30:28] Seventh Seal is polygamy that's not true
[1:30:31] that's false
[1:30:32] polygamy is me polygamy is brother Brown
[1:30:36] I mean the third Pole of the Seventh
[1:30:39] Seal that's what is coming and I agree
[1:30:42] they made it everything in the world
[1:30:45] external but just like this revival that
[1:30:48] we're talking about it is not an
[1:30:51] external revival it is an internal
[1:30:55] revival in your heart when you go home
[1:30:58] just like I was doing yesterday I
[1:31:00] delivered 40 something packages from
[1:31:03] Noah's Friday for some of you that don't
[1:31:05] know how to go to our store they're
[1:31:10] still open and they're probably empty
[1:31:16] but even delivering 40 packages after
[1:31:19] I'd already to run around I'd delivering
[1:31:21] 40 something packages and God was we
[1:31:23] were talking to each other say you can't
[1:31:26] you don't have to so I said about the
[1:31:27] Midwife you don't have to be in a church
[1:31:30] for God to talk to you he wants to be in
[1:31:34] this tabernacle anyway so talk to him
[1:31:38] pray without ceasing don't close your
[1:31:40] eyes while you're delivering 40 packages
[1:31:42] though you run into something you don't
[1:31:45] have to close your eyes to talk to God
[1:31:47] to me that's really a tradition because
[1:31:50] Jesus even if Tim allows us he looks up
[1:31:52] into heaven and he's his father I'm
[1:31:54] doing this for them
[1:31:56] you don't have to close your eyes to
[1:31:57] talk to God if you kept your eyes open
[1:32:00] you might see him hey man let's sing a

[1:37:07] you'll never have to be sorrowful oh
[1:37:12] dear Heavenly Father thank you Lord at
[1:37:17] this time of the year Lord they sing
[1:37:19] songs about you being a baby the Lord we
[1:37:24] understand who you are you were God
[1:37:27] Almighty
[1:37:29] laying in that feed trough and you came
[1:37:34] for one purpose and that was to get your
[1:37:36] children so that we could feed off of

[1:37:42] that we could have eternal life
[1:37:45] the Bible says you were born Emmanuel

[1:38:05] are but under inspiration we see that
[1:38:09] they wrote songs about you maybe not
[1:38:10] even understanding who you were but Lord
[1:38:13] God you sent a prophet in the end time
[1:38:16] they brought an open book that we could
[1:38:20] see that you came from God and you went
[1:38:23] back to God and then he said we came
[1:38:25] from God and we're going back to God
