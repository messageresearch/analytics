[7:24] I won't
[7:27] [Music]
[8:01] in the
[8:04] [Music]
[8:56] amen
[8:58] a blessed year this morning we've seen
[9:01] that song holy holy I think that's the
[9:04] ultimate destination that each one of us
[9:07] wants to live we want to live in that
[9:09] holy of holies don't want to live in the
[9:12] outer court or the inner court want to
[9:14] live in that holy of Holy's brother
[9:17] Branham says have you ever met somebody
[9:18] who's been there it doesn't matter if
[9:21] it's Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or
[9:23] Thursday or Friday or doesn't matter
[9:25] always sweet always kind always gentle
[9:29] and when you're when you're in that
[9:32] presence nothing else nothing else
[9:35] matters it's a it's a supreme
[9:38] supernatural experience that is that is
[9:41] reserved only for the bride of Jesus
[9:42] Christ you know oftentimes people they
[9:46] think that that we're a human being and
[9:49] we've come to earth to have a spiritual
[9:53] experience but in reality and if you
[9:56] really go back to the essence of what
[9:58] brother Branham brought about we are a
[10:01] supernatural being and we've come to
[10:03] earth to have a human experience and our
[10:08] mandate in our mission and our passion
[10:10] is to overcome that human experience
[10:14] which means our eyes or ears or taste or
[10:17] touch or smell and then our conscience
[10:20] or memory or imagination our reasonings
[10:23] and affections and let the Holy Ghost
[10:25] take control of the control tower and
[10:28] just steer you and we have to you know
[10:31] God has put us on free moral agency and
[10:34] the greatest power he gives a human
[10:37] being is the power of choice and so we
[10:39] have to be careful everything we do
[10:42] every hour of the day we make choices
[10:44] indecision
[10:45] thousands of them we ride down the road
[10:48] we make a decision go this way go that
[10:50] way stop four and so our mind is
[10:52] constantly in motion and so we've got to
[10:55] be careful the choices that we make what
[10:58] we allow to go in to our eyes and ears
[11:00] because once we allow it whether it's a
[11:03] book we read or a mag
[11:05] zyne or whatever once it goes into the
[11:08] eyes or ears it takes a journey
[11:11] instantaneous journeys of the back road
[11:13] of your mind
[11:14] and there is produced a thought and
[11:17] those thoughts become words and words
[11:19] produces actions actions form habits and
[11:23] habits produces character and character
[11:26] determines our destiny and God puts that
[11:29] choice in front of us what a powerful
[11:32] choice and I'm just so thankful that
[11:36] that God has chosen us to receive this
[11:40] this this message and take us on a
[11:43] supernatural mystical journey and we can
[11:46] go with transdimensional travelers
[11:48] friends we live in a natural world but
[11:51] anytime we want we can just close our
[11:54] eyes and make a decision to go into that
[11:56] supernatural world and just meditate on
[11:59] the Word of God and let God saturate our
[12:02] being with who he is and who we are amen
[12:08] I want I want you a special request I am
[12:13] I have a desire to go to the Philippines
[12:16] and I want to go next month and they
[12:19] have a ministers meeting the first the
[12:21] first of every month and brother Vernon
[12:23] has asked me to be there for that
[12:26] ministers meeting the first week in May
[12:28] and I haven't been for several years and
[12:31] I cannot tell you how you know how much
[12:34] in excitement and anticipation and
[12:36] expectations of God I've been there 27
[12:39] times but every time I go there it's
[12:41] like the first time and the Filipino
[12:44] people they have a they have a nature
[12:47] and a culture and and they just they
[12:51] have a sincerity and a humility and a
[12:54] respect that that you very very seldom
[12:57] find in the world and so please pray
[13:01] that that God will make that way for for
[13:04] me to go and so I know each one of us we
[13:08] have prayers we have needs on our hearts
[13:10] and I pray today that something will be
[13:13] said in the word that will help you to
[13:16] meet that need that you have and we're
[13:19] going to
[13:19] asked you to turn in your Bibles to the
[13:21] second chapter a second book of Timothy
[13:24] chapter one and verse seven and this
[13:28] morning I would like to speak on a
[13:30] subject called a sound mind
[13:34] second Timothy one will start reading at
[13:38] verse one before you read let's pray
[13:47] father this is your sacred supernatural
[13:51] book and we know that that revelation is
[13:55] a sovereign act of God we know Lord that
[13:58] only you can impart revelation so many
[14:03] people they have lots of knowledge but
[14:05] they don't have wisdom to operate the
[14:07] knowledge because they have not received
[14:09] the revelation and lord only you can cut
[14:12] through all of our mental faculties all
[14:15] of our emotional needs and and go right
[14:19] down and just reach us right at the core
[14:22] of our being Father and Lord we want
[14:25] that core of each one of our beings to
[14:27] be stimulated today we pray Lord that
[14:30] that that your word will be spoken and
[14:33] your word will be heard and your word
[14:35] will be acted upon by your children
[14:37] father it's a serious a sobering time an
[14:40] hour that we are living in father we
[14:43] love to enjoy our faith we love to enjoy
[14:46] our company in the believers Lord but
[14:49] there comes a time when we come to your
[14:52] word and Lord I pray that the sacred
[14:54] time the short time that we'll spend
[14:56] this morning it will be encouraging and
[14:59] edifying
[15:00] to your bride and we ask these blessings
[15:02] and your precious and Holy Name of our
[15:05] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[15:08] so Paul is speaking to Timothy says Paul
[15:12] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[15:15] of God according to the promise of life
[15:17] which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my
[15:20] dearly beloved son now this was not
[15:26] Paul's son as you all know but anybody
[15:28] who Paul personally witnessed to that
[15:30] received Christ Paul considered them his
[15:33] son so said Timothy my dearly beloved
[15:36] son grace mercy and peace from God the
[15:40] Father and Christ Jesus our Lord I thank
[15:43] God whom I serve from my forefathers
[15:46] with pure conscience that without
[15:48] ceasing I have remembrance of the in my
[15:51] prayer night and day greatly desiring to
[15:54] see thee being mindful of thy tears that
[15:58] I may be filled with joy when I
[16:00] call to remembrance the unfeigned faith
[16:02] that is in thee which dwelleth first in
[16:06] thy grandmother Lois and thy mother
[16:08] Eunice and I am persuaded that in the
[16:11] also this is the the the scripture the
[16:15] key scripture I want to focus on and
[16:18] Paul is saying wherefore I put thee in
[16:20] remembrance that thou steer up the gift
[16:23] of God which is in thee by the putting
[16:26] out of my hands for God had not given us
[16:29] the spirit of fear but of power and of
[16:33] love and of a sound mind be not
[16:38] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[16:41] our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be
[16:45] thou a partaker of the afflictions of
[16:48] the Gospel according to the power of God
[16:50] who hath called us and who has saved us
[16:53] and called us with a holy calling not
[16:55] according to our works but according to
[16:58] his own purpose and grace which was
[17:00] given to us in Christ Jesus before the
[17:04] world began amen god bless you boy that
[17:08] is that that is a mouthful that Paul
[17:11] just spoke and if you can see if we can
[17:17] take Paul's you know Paul's thoughts
[17:19] he's speaking to Timothy and in the day
[17:22] that they're living in it was a very
[17:25] dangerous time to be a Christian because
[17:29] Nero was on the throne and Nero he was a
[17:33] madman you've all heard that you know
[17:35] the the idiom that Nero fiddled while
[17:37] Rome burned and he blamed it on the
[17:39] Christian well Paul he knew that Timothy
[17:42] was just a young he was just a young
[17:45] minister and he was trying to encourage
[17:47] him he said you know don't don't let
[17:50] fear and we know that fear is a
[17:52] four-letter word it's f.e.a.r
[17:54] false evidence appearing real or false
[17:58] education appearing real now to the
[18:01] world they want to f.e.a.r
[18:04] forget everything and run they just want
[18:08] to turn tail but but a Christian is a
[18:11] warrior a Christian they know the weapon
[18:13] of their warfare and you know it's time
[18:16] it's time that people they stop becoming
[18:19] a victim
[18:20] you know there's victimology now
[18:23] everybody think well you know I do I got
[18:25] a problem and I don't have this and I
[18:27] don't have that we need to concentrate
[18:29] on the things that we do have and not
[18:32] the things that we don't have people
[18:34] love today they love to have pity
[18:36] parties and pour me parties and what was
[18:38] me and nobody's got it so rough as me
[18:41] and nobody understands me you know the
[18:43] human being we have five basic needs all
[18:47] of us number one we all want to be loved
[18:51] number two we all want to be needed we
[18:55] want to feel like there is a purpose for
[18:58] for our life we all want to be
[19:02] understood because there's nothing worse
[19:04] than being misunderstood and and we we
[19:09] all have a big sign on our back it says
[19:11] please make me feel important and you
[19:15] know we don't advertise that but in
[19:18] reality we all want to feel like we have
[19:21] a part to play we want to be loved we
[19:24] want to be needed we want to be
[19:25] understood and and so we want to be we
[19:28] want to feel important and there's
[19:30] nobody that can fulfill all those needs
[19:34] like God can God loves you God makes you
[19:38] feel important God lets you know that
[19:40] you're needed and there's nobody that
[19:42] can understand you like God does you
[19:45] know many people will misunderstand you
[19:49] and in the Bible the men who brought the
[19:51] Bible the prophets of the Old Testament
[19:54] they were all misunderstood and most of
[19:56] them were killed by the very people that
[19:59] God sent them to to minister and so in
[20:02] in that word if you go into the
[20:04] amplified bible that scripture in 2nd
[20:08] timothy 7 the amplified says now god has
[20:11] not given you a spirit of fear but of
[20:13] power and of love he has given you a
[20:16] mind that has been delivered rescued
[20:19] revived salvaged protected and brought
[20:23] into a place of safety and security so
[20:27] that it is
[20:27] no longer affected by the illogical
[20:31] unfounded and observed thoughts that
[20:34] Satan wants to put in your mind a sound
[20:37] mind yeah you know brother branham he
[20:39] talks about people who did not have a
[20:42] sum he talked about Elvis Presley
[20:44] he said Elvis Presley had to have four
[20:47] or five psychiatrists that traveled with
[20:50] him just to keep him on stage now just
[20:55] recently one that died not too long ago
[20:58] Michael Jackson here is a man his mind
[21:01] you think about the demons that were
[21:04] rolling around in his mind he could not
[21:07] go to sleep they had they had to give
[21:09] him anesthesia every night that doctor
[21:12] had to come in and take that propofol
[21:14] and they had to put him under for him to
[21:18] go to sleep for him just to get some
[21:20] rest but God has given you an eye a
[21:24] sound mind he's given us the weapons of
[21:28] our warfare you know if you read the
[21:29] message the greatest battle ever fought
[21:31] if you want to keep a sound mind and you
[21:35] want to be balanced and know who you are
[21:37] you need to know how to fight and
[21:40] brother branham this is not all in one
[21:42] paragraph but he says about the devil
[21:44] how to fight the devil he said cut him
[21:47] chop him wacom slice him maim him kill
[21:53] him kick him out now this is not
[21:58] playtime this is real these demons if
[22:02] you're a son of God belong to this
[22:04] message you've got a bull's-eye on your
[22:06] back when you wake up in the morning
[22:09] every demon in that area that's a sign
[22:12] to you they know your name your address
[22:14] your email address your cell phone
[22:16] number they know every mistake you've
[22:18] ever made they know your weaknesses and
[22:21] sometime they will come and they will
[22:23] gang up on you yeah a whole bunch of
[22:25] demons will come and try to you know to
[22:27] get you into an area or try to set a
[22:31] trap for you to walk into see we need to
[22:34] know brother Branham says we need to
[22:36] know our own weaknesses and we need to
[22:39] keep them covered
[22:40] you can you can sense when those demons
[22:44] are coming you can sense them their
[22:46] presence mille to just to take positive
[22:51] action some of the greatest things we
[22:54] can do is speak the name of jesus prayer
[22:57] praise righteousness all these these are
[23:00] weapons brother Branham says when the
[23:03] weakest Christian gets on his knees the
[23:06] devil begins to tremble now we've got to
[23:09] be aware of that we also need to be
[23:11] aware that when we were born there was
[23:13] an angel assigned to us and that angel
[23:16] has been with us every step every day
[23:19] the angel has been with us through the
[23:21] good the bad and the ugly he's seen it
[23:25] he's watched it but he's there to
[23:29] protect us we're never to people say
[23:32] well I'm lonely how can you be lonely if
[23:35] you have a revelation and the
[23:36] understanding that you have an angel and
[23:39] I believe those angels they like to be
[23:42] recognized
[23:43] they like to well I'm thankful like you
[23:46] how many times I can think of where
[23:49] where I should have been dead in a car
[23:51] accident and and and it just seemed like
[23:53] you met just by just by a little
[23:56] fraction you know you miss a horrible
[23:58] accident and that was that angels just
[24:01] take that thing and just push a car out
[24:03] of the way for you to survive I've had
[24:05] accidents where a guy hit me my car
[24:08] flipped twice and rolled three times and
[24:11] you know all the when I was going
[24:13] through that all as I was saying was
[24:15] Jesus helped me and when the car stopped
[24:18] I jumped out of the car had to kick the
[24:21] door open jumped out of the car and I
[24:23] ran because I didn't know if the car was
[24:24] gonna blow up and after I ran and and
[24:28] you know they found out I had had ribs
[24:29] that were all cracked I was as sore as
[24:31] possibly could be but I know that that
[24:34] angel of God was there with me that the
[24:37] the policeman that came they looked at
[24:40] that car and I cannot believe that
[24:42] you're walking I cannot believe you're
[24:44] standing I said well it's not me it's
[24:46] the God that I served that has prison
[24:49] that has preserved
[24:53] every one of us we have a mandate and
[24:55] that mandate is to be a shrine for the
[24:58] Holy Ghost no you're not that your body
[25:00] is a temple of the Holy Ghost and you
[25:04] know every part of our body I was
[25:06] talking to brother Wade the other day
[25:07] and every winter time I get little
[25:09] cracks right here on my thumbs
[25:11] and I was talking to brother Wade says
[25:13] do you have any of that any any of that
[25:15] honey products or bee products that you
[25:17] can put on there and I went to the
[25:19] pharmacist and I asked the pharmacist I
[25:21] said don't you have some kind of thing
[25:23] that can repair those creamy buddy else
[25:26] get cracked right there and your thumbs
[25:27] you know what he told me he said get
[25:29] some superglue and put some superglue on
[25:32] it he's that'll hold it together and it
[25:34] won't crack and then after a summer time
[25:36] you can just kind of get a file and just
[25:38] file it off but you know when one little
[25:41] part of our body when it gets out of
[25:43] what maybe it's a how many have ever
[25:44] hurt your toe oh and when you hurt your
[25:48] toe that's all you can think about is my
[25:50] toe or your wrist or or knee whatever it
[25:54] is see in this body it works super
[25:57] naturally in harmony that the mystery
[26:00] and the wonder of the chemicals of our
[26:03] body the digestive system the
[26:05] respiratory system the nervous system I
[26:08] mean it's just a wonder to behold we are
[26:11] fearfully and wonderfully made and we
[26:14] are made to prosper and thrive in the
[26:17] realms of the supernatural we're the
[26:20] only ones that can do that
[26:21] you know here in Georgia there's out
[26:24] tens of thousands of churches that will
[26:26] gather today and there's men who have
[26:28] studied and maybe they're going to give
[26:30] a good sermon about the Bible and people
[26:33] come to church and they expect to hear a
[26:35] man of God and and it'll hear sermons
[26:37] but I can tell you out of all the
[26:40] thousands of churches that are going on
[26:43] right now there is not going to be one
[26:45] single true new birth take place in any
[26:49] of those churches outside of a message
[26:52] Church it's impossible it's impossible
[26:55] because I'm talking about a new birth
[26:57] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:59] because brother Branham said there's
[27:00] only one true
[27:02] evidence that a person truly has the
[27:04] genuine Holy Ghost and that is that if
[27:07] you can receive the message for your
[27:11] hour and manifest the life that's the
[27:19] key many people can quote this message
[27:22] many people they love to argue the
[27:24] message then they got a a warrior spirit
[27:26] on them but they they argue about the
[27:29] wrong things you know I love when I when
[27:32] I read things in the Bible and and and
[27:35] it's just personal to the bride purse
[27:38] and in things that other people can
[27:40] never see I love her brother branham you
[27:43] know what when they were talking about
[27:44] the seals there was a great debate is
[27:46] the seals open is this the seven sea is
[27:49] it open is it not open
[27:51] well I read where brother Branham said
[27:53] that now remember some people the only
[27:57] exercise they ever get is jumping to
[28:00] conclusions right now I don't want you
[28:03] to do that I will hear me out the
[28:05] brother branham said the Seventh Seal is
[28:08] not open to the public but it is open to
[28:15] the private special bride of Jesus
[28:17] Christ brother Branham one time you know
[28:21] people talk about you know being saved
[28:22] by the blood saved by the blood saved by
[28:24] the blood brother branham said you're
[28:26] not saved by the blood the people's
[28:29] uh-huh what
[28:30] I'm not saved by the blood brother said
[28:33] no you're kept saved by the blood but
[28:36] you were saying before the foundation of
[28:38] the world you're in the mind of God and
[28:41] God knows every step that you're going
[28:43] to take you know people you know people
[28:47] can talk about you know foreknowledge
[28:49] and they believe that but when you talk
[28:51] about predestination I mean it stumbles
[28:55] oh yeah I said well do you believe that
[28:56] God knows how many hairs are on my head
[28:58] right now they said yeah I said do you
[29:00] believe he'll know how many hairs would
[29:02] be on my head next week yeah he'll know
[29:05] but they cannot believe that God knew
[29:08] before the foundation of the world who
[29:10] he would call who would serve Him
[29:13] what their life was going to be so we
[29:15] are predestinated to prosper in this
[29:18] realm of the supernatural revelation is
[29:22] the definition of revelation is a
[29:25] supernatural multiplication of
[29:27] inspiration and revelation for
[29:30] communication with God we are linked up
[29:33] with am nipa tense linked up with
[29:35] emissions linked up with this
[29:38] omnipresent but we have to be aware of
[29:40] it many people are slumbering that
[29:43] they're walking or and sometimes you go
[29:47] to churches and people there like
[29:48] spiritual mannequins and sometimes you
[29:54] see people you know and they move a
[29:57] little bit and I said well there's been
[29:59] a quivering of the corpse but no real
[30:01] movement yet and and weird to me the
[30:05] Bible says we are lively stones maybe we
[30:10] forgot there were lively stones maybe we
[30:13] forgot how to say amen maybe we forgot
[30:16] that you have a responsibility to enter
[30:19] into the service you have a
[30:20] responsibility to help brother Sam help
[30:23] brother wait any minister to stand
[30:24] behind here we are depending upon you
[30:29] now what if I get up here and say well
[30:31] today we're going to talk about the
[30:36] Seventh Seal you know it reminds me of a
[30:40] story this Baptist minister he was up
[30:43] there and he was preaching and he looked
[30:45] down and he saw brother Lee was sleeping
[30:48] so he said to brother Smith he says
[30:49] brother Smith he said you go over there
[30:51] and wake up brother Lee and brother
[30:53] Smith says no you put him to sleep you
[30:58] go wake him up and so we need to be
[31:05] aware when we come to church we don't
[31:08] come to church to be a bump on a log we
[31:11] come to church to be on the edge of our
[31:13] seat to be waiting for God to reveal
[31:16] something about our nature something
[31:19] about our future something that we don't
[31:22] know to be able to read between the
[31:24] lines I said yesterday brother branham's
[31:26] are we sufficiently impressed with what
[31:29] God has done
[31:30] amongst us you know I want to tell you a
[31:33] story I don't know how it happened but I
[31:39] wound up at PTL Bible School Jim Baker's
[31:43] Bible school 1981 they had a commercial
[31:47] on television you know when they had
[31:50] television had just become satellite
[31:52] network and they had the TV in and they
[31:55] had Pat Robertson's 700 club and Jim
[31:58] Baker and I was like it was like bedside
[32:01] baptist 24 hours a day you know you
[32:03] could turn that television on and so you
[32:05] know I had a desire and and I felt the
[32:08] call in my life and I was going around
[32:10] the Full Gospel businessman giving my
[32:12] testimony and and I saw the the effect
[32:15] that it was having people were coming
[32:16] and getting saved so I had a desire but
[32:19] in those days you thought well I don't
[32:21] have I don't have time to go to four
[32:23] years a Bible School a theology school
[32:25] and back then if you didn't have a
[32:28] degree you didn't have a certificate you
[32:30] couldn't preach anywhere I'm not talk
[32:32] about message Church I'm talking about
[32:33] denominational churches you had to have
[32:36] a Baptist degree or a Presbyterian
[32:38] degree or some kind of a degree where
[32:40] you went to Bible School and you were
[32:42] trained before you could get behind
[32:43] their Pope something by you know an even
[32:47] Assembly of God they had Assembly of God
[32:48] school I was thinking about going to
[32:50] that school and they come on television
[32:52] they said we have a boot camp we have a
[32:55] 11-month boot camp
[32:56] for ministers and you don't have to go
[32:59] to four years of college you'll be busy
[33:01] from the time you wake up to the time
[33:03] you go to bed at night time you'll be in
[33:05] the jails you'll be in the rest homes
[33:07] you'll be out ministering and something
[33:09] grabbed me and I got an application sent
[33:11] that in got accepted and went there I
[33:13] had the most wonderful awful year of my
[33:16] life it was it was it was akin to
[33:22] organized insanity is what it was like
[33:24] and I was a little bit older than most
[33:27] of the students that were there so they
[33:29] they elected me to be the president of
[33:31] the student body and every week I had to
[33:33] go and meet with Jim and Tammy on Friday
[33:36] afternoon after the broadcast and it was
[33:38] it was just like a tradition
[33:40] you know we went and they they they sat
[33:43] there and they asked question but you
[33:44] know there was no real depth to it and
[33:47] you know you I gotta say you think Tammy
[33:50] Faye if any you ever saw her on
[33:52] television you think she looks scary on
[33:54] television you should have saw her in
[33:55] person and and and everyday they had
[34:00] they had one of these shock jocks on the
[34:02] on the FM radio and they had everyday
[34:05] they had a little section about PTL and
[34:08] about Tammy and Jim and his and you know
[34:10] it like three or four minutes and one of
[34:12] them was that they got these t-shirts
[34:14] and the t-shirt looked like a painter
[34:16] just taking just splash paint just like
[34:18] you should and so on the back of the
[34:20] t-shirt that said I ran into Tammy Faye
[34:23] in the malls today but there I was in
[34:27] the middle of that and anybody who was
[34:30] going to be on the television show at 11
[34:32] o'clock they had him at the chapel
[34:34] service at 8 o'clock getting warmed up
[34:36] we heard every kind of a doctorate every
[34:39] kind of a theory and and one would come
[34:41] one day next thing he would come and
[34:43] contradict what the guy said before and
[34:45] so I mean it was it was it was something
[34:48] and so finally I graduate from PT a--
[34:53] but I want to tell you Jim Baker he was
[34:56] a marketing magician so he went to
[34:59] Israel one time and he saw the place the
[35:02] factory where they made the little
[35:04] widows mites and so he was intrigued by
[35:07] it now I talking about and he said he
[35:09] said can you mass-produce these just oh
[35:13] yeah yeah we is it
[35:14] any amount no matter how many our yeah
[35:17] yeah we can so he got the idea to bring
[35:20] those widows mites and he had a
[35:22] beautiful little case to put him in and
[35:24] he had the scripture I mean it was a
[35:26] beautiful display I think it cost him
[35:29] seventeen cents for the two widows mites
[35:31] and and the little package again and and
[35:34] I remember that he said now folks he
[35:36] says we have an incredible offer for you
[35:38] he said right from Israel you're going
[35:41] to have the opportunity to have two of
[35:44] the original widows might just like the
[35:47] Widow's mite and and you know and and
[35:50] they had the higher fifth
[35:52] the more storage places just to put the
[35:56] mail in for the for the mailman to put
[35:59] it in and they had to hire a hundred
[36:01] more people to count the money when it
[36:04] was coming in now brother branham he
[36:07] says that that whatever a voice goes it
[36:10] never disappears you know it's out there
[36:12] somewhere
[36:13] now could you imagine if one of these TV
[36:16] evangelists one of these guys if they
[36:18] could ever get the voice of let's say
[36:20] Moses Moses voice out there when he came
[36:23] down from the mountain with the Ten
[36:25] Commandments I can just imagine they
[36:28] said well you know folks we have an
[36:30] incredible never before offer we have
[36:33] the very voice of Moses as he was coming
[36:38] down the mountain
[36:39] with the Ten Commandments and for an
[36:42] offer this is a very limited offering
[36:45] and for only $1,000 you can have eight
[36:49] eight that they had tapes back you can
[36:51] have a tape of the voice of Moses and
[36:53] I'll tell you friends they would that
[36:56] millions would come in but we have 1100
[37:02] plus tapes of the voice of God every
[37:07] message brother Branham preached it was
[37:10] a masterpiece
[37:11] he didn't preach any sermon that was not
[37:14] a masterpiece because it was Jesus
[37:16] Christ it was inspired by God
[37:19] could you imagine you know what I got
[37:23] really locked down to this message when
[37:25] God gave me an absolute it was when
[37:28] brother Branham I hear it is now sister
[37:30] you don't know me and I don't know you
[37:33] but there is one here who does know you
[37:36] and doesn't know me it says now when he
[37:42] and his spirit comes in me and my spirit
[37:51] goes away and he gives me a temporary
[37:56] resurrection in my spirit and he wants
[38:01] to use my body and I'm so happy
[38:05] loan it to him now when a person gets
[38:08] that understanding they can they can
[38:10] divide the a son of man from the Son of
[38:14] Man the Son of Man wanted to come in and
[38:17] use a son of man could you imagine what
[38:20] that was like her brother branham's
[38:22] there and all of a sudden he his spirit
[38:24] gets ejected and Jesus moves in and
[38:28] Jesus tells who what when where why and
[38:32] all of a sudden you know he's finished
[38:33] and brother branham gets lamb back into
[38:36] his body you know he said it's all like
[38:38] a dream to me now but whatever he said
[38:41] you do it when I when I got that when I
[38:45] understood what God had done in my
[38:49] generation and brother branham was the
[38:53] elijah prophet of Malachi 4 in
[38:56] Revelation 10 7 I mean to say I was
[39:00] enthusiastic it'll award enthusiasm it
[39:02] comes from the Greek word in Theo's en
[39:05] th e OS and it means God within or like
[39:10] God
[39:11] so enthusiasm and in 2nd Timothy it says
[39:14] you shall receive power after that the
[39:17] Holy Ghost is come upon you and that
[39:19] word power comes from the word Greek
[39:20] word Dunamis and that's where they get
[39:22] the word dynamite from and so the you
[39:25] can take him paraphrase that you shall
[39:27] receive
[39:27] dynamite after that the Holy Ghost is
[39:29] come upon you and you should be
[39:31] exploding upon the scene every day
[39:35] everywhere you move a son of God is an
[39:38] action a daughter of God is in action
[39:40] with a mandate with a precision decision
[39:44] to serve God to find that perfect will
[39:48] of God you know we were not looking for
[39:52] the message nobody was looking for the
[39:57] message we didn't even know that was a
[40:01] message before coming to the message
[40:04] friends I was like a spiritual skeleton
[40:08] I hadn't no I had no meat on my bones
[40:11] talking about Revelation I had doctor
[40:14] and I had customed I had rich oral
[40:16] traditions theory I had
[40:18] these things but when I came to the
[40:20] message God began packing on pounds
[40:22] packing on pounds until finally you
[40:26] become aware of your destiny you become
[40:29] aware of your origin you become aware
[40:31] that you're an eternal being you never
[40:34] had a beginning you never had an end
[40:36] like God said to job Joe where were you
[40:38] before the foundation of the world when
[40:40] the sons of God shouted for joy and Joe
[40:44] after he had been making all of his talk
[40:46] to God and then he says I hope I've said
[40:50] enough and he closed his mouth said Lord
[40:53] I said enough
[40:55] and so here we are as children of the
[40:58] Most High God you know what happened
[41:01] went went when Moses when Moses was
[41:05] raised up what what a destiny had he was
[41:09] he was born at a time when all the
[41:11] children should be killed his mother and
[41:13] father they had confidence that he was
[41:15] the deliverer the random said they were
[41:17] praying for God to send a deliverer and
[41:19] Moses mother and father they prayed that
[41:22] Moses would be the deliverer they were
[41:24] praying specifically and so when when
[41:27] the danger was their brother arrested
[41:29] they put a little ark and they put Moses
[41:31] in that Ark and just put him down the
[41:34] Nile River and he floated down the Nile
[41:36] River all the crocodiles and alligators
[41:38] in there but he had he had a purpose and
[41:41] a predestinated destination and miriam
[41:45] share and she she's walking along gonna
[41:47] see what what's happened to her little
[41:49] brother Moses and God just directs that
[41:51] Ark right into Pharaoh's daughter's camp
[41:54] and she looks at the baby she said oh
[41:57] it's one of the Hebrew children it's one
[42:03] of the ones that my daddy says must die
[42:06] but I'm gonna keep him right I'm gonna
[42:10] raise him up oh my god knows how to do
[42:13] it and raises him up
[42:15] powerful man intelligent man brilliant
[42:19] genius military strategy living a life
[42:23] of luxury
[42:24] living a life that we cannot even begin
[42:27] to imagine all the while my mom said
[42:30] remember
[42:31] you're the deliverer who meant remember
[42:33] your place remember you call it
[42:35] he's a don't worry mom I'm studying and
[42:37] you know I'm studying about warfare I'm
[42:40] studying about how to be a soldier and
[42:41] when the time is right
[42:43] I'm gonna lose I know I'm a deliverer
[42:45] and we wound up with one dead Egyptian
[42:47] one dead stinking Egyptian and then the
[42:50] next day he's still in that moment he
[42:53] sees two two two his rails who Jews
[42:55] arguing he's a Brothers
[42:59] what are you doing arguing and they said
[43:02] Oh Moses
[43:03] what are you gonna do you gonna kill us
[43:06] like you killed that Egyptian yesterday
[43:08] and that was it a fugitive 40 years on
[43:12] the run taking care of dirty stinking
[43:15] could you imagine the tortured mind of
[43:19] Moses having to go from the lifestyle he
[43:22] had out to the backside of a desert and
[43:25] then getting a wife that nag nag nag nag
[43:29] nag nag nag oh my and then after that
[43:34] you know Moses now he's 80 years old the
[43:36] thought of God ever using him was the
[43:39] furthest thing from his mind and God
[43:42] comes and God just happens to come in
[43:44] the burning bush and Moses he got excuse
[43:48] itis he gave God every reason in the
[43:50] world why he couldn't do it he couldn't
[43:52] go he couldn't be the man and God said
[43:55] okay yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get your
[43:58] brother I'm gonna get Aaron and Aaron
[44:01] he'll be your mouthpiece and and you'd
[44:04] be God to Aaron Aaron will be your
[44:05] prophet now he hadn't seen Aaron for 40
[44:08] years and Aaron just happens to come
[44:11] walking around the block just comes
[44:13] walking around the mountaintop Oh Moses
[44:16] where have you been all these 40 years
[44:18] and mo what we got a job to do and you
[44:21] know we don't have to go into detail but
[44:23] Moses went in there and he rocked that
[44:26] that that that that that Egyptian
[44:28] Kingdom like it had never been rocked
[44:30] before and finally they come out and
[44:33] finally you know the last-ditch favor
[44:36] you know what happened Pharaoh's wife
[44:38] after you know Pharaoh changed his mind
[44:41] every time a plague come Affairs okay
[44:44] you can go and then the Bible says God
[44:46] hardness no you can't go you can go no
[44:51] you can't go and finally when they left
[44:55] Moses wife said why you little wimp you
[44:58] Patsy you choose gonna lose gonna make
[45:01] bricks for us who's gonna take care
[45:04] who's gonna wait on us so favor one more
[45:07] time one ditch he gets the army and he
[45:11] goes out there and they all wind up dead
[45:13] now they're on the other side the
[45:15] children are on the other side and
[45:17] they're dancing and at the tambourines
[45:19] going everything's good but now there is
[45:22] a major issue to be handled this is a
[45:26] desert you've got two million people
[45:30] that's that's adult plus the children
[45:33] plus all the animals that they brought
[45:36] with them and they all had to eat every
[45:39] day and they all had to drink every day
[45:42] and it was God's opportunity to show his
[45:46] children that he was Jehovah Jireh now
[45:51] so God he begins he begins to pour out
[45:55] his blessings first of all and and I've
[45:59] done some some work on this every day it
[46:06] took four thousand five hundred tons of
[46:10] manna to feed those people every day and
[46:15] I'm sure the first day it was there all
[46:17] it tastes good I'm healthy you know no
[46:21] sickness shoes don't wear out clothes
[46:24] don't wear out oh my was wonderful but
[46:26] after a while it become common to them
[46:30] every morning a manner run go to go out
[46:36] there you know to pick up the man and
[46:38] just pick it up and bring it after a
[46:40] while no thought of where this manna
[46:43] came from they shouldn't be manna
[46:45] I mean manages appears and they lost a
[46:49] supernatural aspect of what God was
[46:52] doing and after a while they begin to
[46:54] complain about the man you know if you
[46:57] take it
[46:58] you take it all the way out to 40 years
[47:01] it was 65 million tons of manna that God
[47:07] provided for those children in Israel
[47:10] now a ton is 2,000 pounds
[47:12] so take 65 times 2000 65 million times
[47:17] 2000 that's a lot of manna friends but
[47:21] they got tired of the man and so God
[47:24] started sending him quail now you've got
[47:27] three million people and so that means
[47:29] that each month that had to be 90
[47:33] million quail had to appear out of the
[47:36] sky and just drop down and so they made
[47:40] a quail run after a while essence didn't
[47:45] bother them that they shouldn't be quail
[47:46] out here in the desert didn't didn't
[47:49] think about where it had come from all
[47:51] they were thinking about was their
[47:52] problems you know brother branham said
[47:55] they were never more than a day's
[47:57] journey from the promised land but for
[48:00] 40 years they marched around and they
[48:03] were grumbling and complaining and they
[48:06] were gossiping and feeling sorry for
[48:09] themselves and complaining about Moses
[48:12] complaining about manna complaining
[48:15] about the quail in the meantime God is
[48:18] doing one of the most sovereign
[48:20] supernatural acts on a daily basis but
[48:24] they're numb dull desensitized frozen
[48:28] immobilized paralyzed to the
[48:30] supernatural and many today are
[48:32] paralyzed to what God has done and the
[48:36] man 1,100 sermons plus are laying their
[48:40] manna for us to feed upon to get strong
[48:43] to enter into that supernatural essence
[48:46] that we are designed for you know you
[48:48] are what you eat and many people are not
[48:53] eating the word I was talking to brother
[48:58] Sam and brother Sam was talking about
[48:59] and we had something in common how many
[49:02] people he thought had never read the
[49:04] seals book from cover to cover from
[49:08] cover to cover
[49:10] and and one time I was in a church and I
[49:12] just asked how many people have never
[49:14] read a church age book from cover to
[49:16] cover all the young young children are
[49:18] looking around see see who's gonna raise
[49:20] their hand so finally a whole bunch of
[49:22] the and some seniors adults raised their
[49:25] hands too I said well how am I never in
[49:27] a seals book from cover to cover hands
[49:29] went up so the pastor and the Deacons
[49:32] they had some church age books and seals
[49:34] books shipped in and they started
[49:35] passing them out and I encouraged them I
[49:38] said you know if I was a parent and I
[49:40] had a child and the child could you know
[49:42] could read and understand
[49:44] I would bribe them if I had I would
[49:46] bribe them I'd pay them whatever it took
[49:49] to read a man sent from God read a
[49:52] church it and make sure they give you a
[49:54] good book report you want to know what
[49:57] they learned in this chap you know and
[50:00] pay them whatever it takes
[50:03] what what is it worth if your child
[50:05] receives an understanding and gets
[50:08] baptized with the Holy Ghost what's it
[50:10] worth if a man one time had Spurgeon he
[50:15] said he said when your children to
[50:18] Christ when they're young and they'll be
[50:22] your friends for the rest of your life
[50:25] you won't have warfare in your home you
[50:28] won't have to worry about them getting
[50:29] involved with the wrong crowd you know I
[50:33] know I know a little bit about the wrong
[50:34] crowd when I was young that was me I was
[50:38] the wrong crowd there's nothing positive
[50:40] going on you know and the guys that I
[50:43] was running around with it was you know
[50:45] eat drink and be merry that's that's all
[50:47] that's all it took but if you win your
[50:49] children to Christ when they're young my
[50:52] what with all the problems that you
[50:55] avoid the atmosphere in your home the
[50:58] love that's in your home it makes it so
[51:01] easy for God to flow it makes it so easy
[51:04] when you go to the message and you have
[51:06] an understanding of what God's purpose
[51:10] is for a mother and a father and a
[51:12] family and how to operate the Bible the
[51:16] the the the the Lord's Prayer thy
[51:19] kingdom come Thy will be done on earth
[51:23] as it is in heaven wouldn't that be
[51:25] great if that was our home that the will
[51:28] of God was being done in our home every
[51:30] day as it's being done in heaven I want
[51:33] to go a little bit further now how many
[51:35] have ever seen the rock the rock that
[51:37] Moses had you see this little rock it's
[51:39] about this big and it's got a little
[51:41] trickle a little trickle of water coming
[51:44] out of it
[51:44] anybody ever seen that well I Got News
[51:47] for you that rock it had to supply 100
[51:53] million gallons of water every week for
[51:58] the children and the animals and the
[52:01] adults now I tried to multiply that by
[52:04] 40 years and my computer wouldn't go
[52:07] that far
[52:07] so in that rock I mean it was a gusher a
[52:11] gusher and they didn't have to have a
[52:14] dolly to pull that rock around that rock
[52:17] just followed them wherever they went
[52:19] the rock just went with them
[52:21] could you imagine I mean I mean how
[52:24] could you not understand God if you got
[52:26] a rock following you and this rock is
[52:29] producing a hundred million gallons of
[52:31] water every week to keep everybody a lot
[52:34] keep everybody hydrated God knew how
[52:38] much hydration that they needed and and
[52:41] so now we talked about just a minute
[52:43] victimology you know we know that Satan
[52:48] is our enemy but the Bible talks about
[52:50] Jesus triumphing over the enemy
[52:54] triumphing and and you think about in
[52:57] the old in when the Philistines and in
[53:01] in the the Hittites and the jebusites
[53:03] and all those and when the army would go
[53:06] out there and the army of God would have
[53:09] to go out and fight those people and
[53:11] they were going to war and there were
[53:13] women that were losing their husband for
[53:15] a while and children lose their daddy
[53:17] for a while and they would go out to war
[53:19] and they would come back maybe some of
[53:23] them were wounded some of them were
[53:24] bruised but when they came back whoa a
[53:27] procession you've got the king the noble
[53:32] righteous King he's riding on that Steve
[53:35] coming back
[53:36] and all of his soldiers that went with
[53:39] them they're sharing in the glory coming
[53:42] back riding and then in back of that
[53:45] you've got hundreds of carts load of the
[53:49] booty all the gold all the silver
[53:52] anything that was worth anything
[53:55] they put it on carts and that was a part
[53:58] of the procession and at the end of the
[54:00] procession the crowning glory of the
[54:03] procession was the unrighteous
[54:05] Philistine or the unrighteous he died
[54:08] and he's there and he's got chains on
[54:11] his legs chains on his arms and he's
[54:13] just kind of walking like that and the
[54:15] people are looking at they say you mean
[54:18] this is the guy this is the one that
[54:21] caused all all those problems and you
[54:24] see that that's where we are
[54:26] Satan is a defeated foe the paradox is
[54:31] the battle goes on every day but the war
[54:35] has already been won and we have got to
[54:39] act you see in in in Satan's Eden there
[54:42] are Victor's and victims you have to
[54:45] decide which one you're going to be you
[54:48] need to be the hero of your own story
[54:52] God has ordained you God has equipped
[54:55] you to become a hero he's equipped you
[54:58] know we were in Murfreesboro one time
[54:59] and one of the brothers came up had a
[55:01] t-shirt brother Wade and it said it said
[55:03] I survived Laodicea and my pastor
[55:08] brother Bisco he said well he said
[55:10] that's good he said but next time you
[55:13] pretty shirt put I overcame Laodicea and
[55:17] that's what we are we are more than
[55:19] conquerors friends we are overcomers
[55:23] [Applause]
[55:24] we're getting rid of the clothes just
[55:27] just in a minute now but I want to take
[55:29] you in in Acts yesterday we talked about
[55:34] about a fool for Christ and if we can go
[55:38] into Acts this is going to be a last
[55:40] scripture for today and we'll pick up
[55:41] pick up tonight but if you can go to
[55:45] Acts chapter 25 and Paul now has been
[55:50] rescued Paul now Minh freedom and now
[55:53] he's he's before Festus and and he's
[55:56] preaching to Festus and and after he
[56:00] preaches to him
[56:01] Festus is shaking you know he's shaking
[56:04] like this and he says to Paul I will
[56:06] hear you at a more convenient time and
[56:09] he walked away my you know he was
[56:12] shaking like that at the gospel that had
[56:15] been preached to him he was vibrating
[56:17] with fear he knew it was true but he
[56:21] knew he couldn't live it and then they
[56:23] take him and he goes from there
[56:25] and he goes you got Festus Felix and
[56:27] Agrippa one of them says I'll hear you
[56:30] at a more convenient time the second one
[56:32] said Paul much learning has made thee
[56:35] mad he said I'm not mad I just got the
[56:38] mind of Christ and the third one Agrippa
[56:41] Agrippa sitting there and Agrippa says
[56:44] Paul almost persuade us now me to become
[56:51] a Christian let's let's stand to our
[56:53] feet friends
[56:54] could you imagine these men they had the
[56:58] Apostle Paul the the first church age
[57:01] messenger personally preached to them
[57:05] but the three different responses one of
[57:07] them says I'll hear you at a more
[57:10] convenient time second one says you
[57:14] don't mad you're crazy
[57:16] you're a nut I've had a lot of people
[57:19] tell me I'm a nut I said I might be a
[57:22] nut but I'm screwed to the right boat I
[57:25] am screwed - thus saith the Lord I am
[57:29] screwed to eternity I was telling some
[57:32] of the brothers I've decided what my
[57:34] next vehicle is going to be it's going
[57:37] to be a travel like a thought vehicle
[57:39] that's gonna be my next new vehicle that
[57:42] I get oh my water day that's going to be
[57:45] friends and we're going to look we're
[57:48] going to look Jesus in the eye we're
[57:50] going to see him he's going to say to
[57:52] his bride well done good and faithful
[57:55] servant enter into the kingdom prepared
[57:57] for you but to others he's going to say
[58:00] depart from me you
[58:02] workers of iniquity iniquity is doing
[58:05] something that you know you're not
[58:07] supposed to do or not doing something
[58:09] you're supposed to do depart from me and
[58:13] they're gonna what Lord didn't we do
[58:15] this and didn't we do that didn't we
[58:16] he says I never knew you I never became
[58:22] intimate with you we never had relations
[58:26] you never became pregnant with my spirit
[58:30] the Holy Ghost did not dwell in you it
[58:33] didn't lead you it didn't guide you it
[58:35] didn't direct you to the place where you
[58:37] needed to be depart from me you workers
[58:40] of iniquity you know brother Branham
[58:43] went when he preached about the great
[58:46] white throne judgment if you've never
[58:49] heard this friends I want you to hear it
[58:51] today
[58:52] he said that great white throne judgment
[58:54] when a person walks up
[58:57] now the bride's going to be there and
[59:00] the whole world's going to be there
[59:03] everybody's going to be looking and that
[59:05] person that walks up there brother
[59:07] Branham said their whole life is gonna
[59:09] flash before them like a great big
[59:13] screen and they're gonna see their whole
[59:15] life and brother Branham said now we're
[59:17] not going to be able to judge Paul's
[59:19] Church H and Paul's Church age are not
[59:22] going to be able to judge our church
[59:23] we're going to be able to see the people
[59:27] who we live the people who we spoke to
[59:29] the people who we witness and they're
[59:30] never going to be able to say Lord how
[59:33] come you didn't tell me how come how
[59:34] come I didn't get a check how come I
[59:36] didn't know about the message that's on
[59:39] us that's on you that's on me brother
[59:43] Branham said he was talking to his wife
[59:45] it he asked as well he said honey yet
[59:47] what is true value and and then he
[59:49] answered his own question he said
[59:51] nothing but souls
[59:53] is the only thing that's got any value
[59:56] in it money passes away homes decay and
[59:59] go away everything in the earth moves
[1:00:02] away the only value lasting value he
[1:00:06] said I'd rather have one soul in glory
[1:00:09] that I won to Christ and to know and see
[1:00:14] that that this is powerful deep that
[1:00:17] light of God circles around that soul
[1:00:21] throughout all eternity my name to be
[1:00:26] associated with that he said I'd rather
[1:00:29] have that than to have every penny of
[1:00:31] money in the whole earth because I'd
[1:00:33] have to lose lose it all
[1:00:35] but what'd you send up there it's
[1:00:37] eternal and that's why we're trying
[1:00:39] friends there's a world out here friends
[1:00:43] brother Branham said when Jesus was on
[1:00:45] the earth only 1% of the people on the
[1:00:49] earth knew that God had visited the
[1:00:51] earth he said in our generation it's
[1:00:54] going to be 1/100 of 1% of the people in
[1:01:01] the world will ever know about the
[1:01:03] message you're a blessed people Framus
[1:01:08] yesterday we talked about Paul and
[1:01:10] everything he went through if you've got
[1:01:12] problems check your problems against
[1:01:15] Paul Paul was the son of God he was a
[1:01:18] man just like we are a human being just
[1:01:22] like you and I are and God personally
[1:01:25] visited him has God personally visited
[1:01:28] you do you have access to the divine
[1:01:33] library the supernatural library are you
[1:01:37] utilizing it are you growing are you
[1:01:40] learning are you cultivating that
[1:01:42] supernatural nature that's going to
[1:01:45] cause you to act like God would to do
[1:01:48] like God would do let your hands do what
[1:01:51] God's hands would do let your feet go
[1:01:53] where God's feet would do let your mouth
[1:01:56] speak what God's mouth would speak let
[1:01:58] your heart be what God's heart would be
[1:02:01] let's bar his friends Lord sometimes we
[1:02:09] just we just run to a point we want to
[1:02:15] go further we just put a comma Lord and
[1:02:18] just pick it up at the next service Lord
[1:02:22] I feel that enough has been said today
[1:02:27] and I pray that you would internalize
[1:02:31] into the hearts of your children what a
[1:02:35] sound mind
[1:02:37] is a sound mind is the mind of Christ
[1:02:41] Christ living in you Christ thinking for
[1:02:45] you Christ living for you Christ
[1:02:49] overcoming your problems your angel
[1:02:52] guiding you directing you father let the
[1:02:56] let the essence of the supernatural drop
[1:03:00] down in our congregation right now
[1:03:03] father and let this be a red-letter day
[1:03:06] let this be victory day father for
[1:03:09] somebody here that's gonna say Satan you
[1:03:12] have lied to me long enough you have
[1:03:14] deceived me you have trapped me you have
[1:03:16] tricked me but no more devil I'm burying
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:20] I'm putting rest in peace over your
[1:03:22] gravestone and every time you come and
[1:03:25] lie to me I'm going right to that grave
[1:03:27] don't say devil you are a liar you my
[1:03:30] father kicked you out of heaven and and
[1:03:33] now it's my responsibility to keep you
[1:03:36] under my feet
[1:03:37] we had a prophet tell us how to deal
[1:03:40] with the devil father
[1:03:42] we had a devil talk about the weapons of
[1:03:44] our warfare how to live in this world of
[1:03:47] insanity equip us today Lord I pray my
[1:03:50] friends if you're here today and you say
[1:03:53] Lord I need I need more of a sound mind
[1:03:58] I don't I don't want to be nervous I
[1:04:01] don't want to be frustrated I don't want
[1:04:02] to be confused I don't want to be
[1:04:04] depressed I need I need to make a
[1:04:07] precision decision today that the word
[1:04:10] is going to be my absolute the word is
[1:04:13] going to be my guide the message is
[1:04:15] going to overcome for me as I read it as
[1:04:18] I internalize it if that's you friends
[1:04:21] and again you know I don't care I never
[1:04:24] I never opened my eyes I just say if
[1:04:28] that's you friends and you want to say
[1:04:30] God just lift your hand up just a little
[1:04:32] bit and just drop it back down but just
[1:04:34] just enough brother Branham said that
[1:04:36] that's the supernatural act when you
[1:04:38] raise your hand it's a decision that you
[1:04:40] made and God sees your hand and I pray
[1:04:44] if you did raise your hand and if you
[1:04:46] want to let today be the springboard
[1:04:48] into your future eternal life you want
[1:04:52] to have that supernatural existence here
[1:04:55] on earth you want to be part of the
[1:04:56] super Church the super race of people
[1:04:58] part of God's super idea and you want to
[1:05:03] manifest the character and the love of
[1:05:06] God it's your privilege to do that so
[1:05:09] Lord you know the condition of every
[1:05:12] heart I pray that you had just
[1:05:14] fertilized their desire and give them
[1:05:17] passion to live the life that you have
[1:05:19] them to live we ask in Jesus name Amen
