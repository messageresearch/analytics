God bless you good to be back in the house with the Lord if you got your Bibles turn to the Book of Revelations I'd like for you to hang on to your bibles if if you I know that's kind of strange sometimes even with me uh not taking your Bible anymore because it's always up on the screen but we're going to look at something and and I want you to see it for yourself I've got it written on here but I want to see how you to see how the continuity of God works even in writing the letters to the churches all right because we're going to talk about today Alpha and Omega which is the alpha bride and Omega bride all right now we're not we're not doing away with the there's bride through every Church age but he said four times in in Revelations I am the Alpha and Omega he is identifying that what he started with he's going to end with now what in between it went down it went down somewhat because of dogmas and Creeds but the first church age didn't have any the last Church age is not going to have any all right the true bride now that'll be a different ones it'll be false uh bride and there'll be foolish virgins and all that but the true bride in the first church age is a mere image of the true bride in the last Church age all right anybody with me on that not doing away with any of those in between they're just as important they're the body of Christ but God said Jesus said I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last all right so we're going to hone in on that today if you would in Revelations 1 remember the announcements um not this coming Saturday but the next Saturday February 17th at 4:00 down at the where we always have it at at the um Hidden Acres venue there in Gillsville uh sign up today is a deadline uh they're going to take the uh take the list down after service is over so I think most everybody in the buildings pretty much um got their name on the list um if you're going to bring somebody just put plus two you don't have to put their name just put plus two on it I know some of us have that and brother Dutch will be speaking just a few minutes and then we'll have all kind of good games and prizes and and have a good time like we did last year and every other year every how many years we've been doing this and brother Dutch will then preach one service on Sunday morning and that will be Valentine's weekend February 17th and 18th Valentine's Day is on the 14th so that's on Wednesday so this will be when we have the venue all right brother Bob will be speaking for us this coming Wednesday remember them in prayer they're on their way back and brother Joe and sister Rachel will be down there till about Wednesday I think it's when the when the uh thing is over in Savannah also March the second Bible study prayer meeting at 5:00 Bible study from 6:00 to 8 questions and answers uh bring them and I still got one left over from last time that I didn't get to so also remember March the 29th 30th and 31st brother Tim cross will be with us on the 30th and 31st it'll be at 4:00 on Saturday 7 o'clock on Friday and he's going to U have one of the ministers from up there brother Josh Bennett church is going to do that Friday and we'll we'll announce that a little bit later also want to announce something that I've been waiting on for a long time on we're going to do this in February February the 25th everybody with me say Amen February 25th that'll be the last Sunday of this month we're going to have a normal regular Sunday morning service everybody got with me second service Brother John durett he's going to we're going to start he's going to teach us about money and and and the the the Dave Ramy SL Bible way to do things he's he's got little 30 minute Snippets of it down uh you know through time but I told him I said I I just been on my heart for you to do that every other month maybe for the next till till you know may or so so this February the 25th we'll have normal regular mon Sunday morning service Sunday afternoon service be normal regular service and then brother John will get up and teach us how to uh save money use our money right and do it in a Biblical way so it all comes together in a Biblical form so I told him I said praise the Lord maybe people will not sleep on second service listen to you and then then also sometime in March we're going to uh we're going to do that same thing again on the afternoon service but I'll announce that later on um what we might be doing that second service but it'll be something to help every one of us and it'll be a church function so um so just remember keep those things keep brother John in prayer um I asked him several months ago if he would do that and he told me today that yes he would so so we sure appreciate brother John we appreciate his whole family appreciate all of them appreciate what he brings to the table amen so let's go to Revelations 1 ver10 remember all these announcements um keep them all in your prayers um of them all coming back brother Ryan and them be on the way from Kentucky back in just a little bit so remember them so Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest right in the book SED into the seven churches which are in Asia they're Ephesus smrna these are actual cities I don't know if y'all know these are actual cities that that rose up in a certain um area uh there in Asia Minor and there still there now today to some degree they may not all be called the same thing but and some of them were destroyed some of them were uh uh Ephesus used to be on the coast now it's silted up like 2 miles Inland so they're two miles away from the from the coast now and but when when when God was talking to John it was like 96 these places some of them had been established a long time but they're characteristic God said hey there's the Ephesus Smur and all these different ones going to bring the character of each one into that so Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thar so these are real people that lived in real cities these are real cities and they listen they were not all bride cities uh Paul lived in Ephesus for a little while um Mary um the mother of Jesus lived in there and I think she died there and John the Revelator went back there and he lived there because he pastored the church there in Ephesus until he passed away so they they've been into each one of these but these were real people real places just like we got a Gainesville a lul they all have a characteristic Gainesville is the polter capital of the world so you've got each each city has a a character about it and uh and so God thought about these cities enough to like I said Sister Barbara sent that thing where the constellations of the Stars fit right over exactly where they're placed in asiia minor so um to me that's important God's always in continuity he does not change but he puts everything where it needs to be even before before we need it all right cuz he wrote the Bible before the foundation of the world but he imposed a group of people to move to a place called Ephesus and start a city of Ephesus move over here to thara raised up people put it in there put it in their mind he he he told them go there do this all right they just didn't know maybe it was leading to the Lord sometimes we get led by the Lord and we go I don't know if that's the Lord or not but if it takes you into the word of God and it doesn't take you away from the word of God then it's God how you you get here huh you think about how you got here all right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pouch with a golden girle and then he has all these different characteristics we talked about this morning so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day you've give us thank you for the group that you've Lord put in this building today Lord that can hear from you father I pray that you just bless each one heal the sick Lord be with the ones Lord that are downhearted maybe backslid different things Lord I pray that you'd give us Supernatural strength Lord and thank you so much Lord for putting together a team of of men and and sisters that in different places and uh some that can teach Sunday school and do the different things and and just bless brother John and touch him Lord as he we all need the financial help we all need help from you Lord so I pray that you'd bless him and touch him Lord just bless each one for for us of our sins Jesus name we pray Lord be with the ones that are on the way back amen so you may be seated so the Lord is standing there in the midst as we said before he's got his arms stretched out that's the cross he makes actually his own being is the cross just like this right here there he is he's made the cross he's got the candlesticks he's got all the church ages and like I said before don't think that the Holy Ghost was not in any of the other Church ages he was in every Church age because you can't have the Holy you can't have the new birth and not be bride right all right the new birth makes you the Bride of Jesus Christ all right so the first age had it the second age had it the third age had it every age had it but God's got to have a starting place and God's got to have an ending place with the Gentiles cuz he promised that's what he'd be even in Daniel 70 weeks we can run all this into the same thing you've got the time of the Gentiles then God goes to the Jews all right then they've got a time they got three and A2 years right of ministry to come to Perfection so God is he's not a Time creature but he uses time you know why he uses time because we can't use eternity right we have to use time so he has to coordinate it where we can understand time and and then realize that it come from eternity cuz God's an eternal person he's never had a he never had a watch on his arm that's for sure but he's standing here and he says okay I'm going to have a bride I'm going to have seven Church agents I'm going to have seven stars or seven Messengers and I'm going to have seven cities that are built to show that I'm the one doing it no other man could orchestrate this no other singular person could ever orchestrate what God's orchestrated but he said I'm going to have a bride she's going to be me made manifest in another form she's going to be the judge she's going to have the sword out of their mouth because every Church AE messenger he had a sword and he spoke right and he also had like we said about the Judgment the the Saints will judge the Earth we're going to even judge Angels right okay so so where where're the judge of all we know that Christ is the Jud we know he's the Supreme judge but he made us Kings and Priests he made us to be the ones that can judge cuz we'll read the scripture where it says if you judge yourself you be not judged all right we'll read that in the the communion scripture all right so then we talked about prison this morning and you got one light going in which is what you got Christ then you got seven different but they flow into each other have you ever looked at a rainbow there's not like a line and then a blue and then a line and then a yellow everyone molds into the other one goes from one it flows right into the other when you'll see it right here they just kind of flow you got you red it didn't go red yellow it went red orange yellow green then it keep then it goes back toward the blue again so everybody see that the continuity of God is that it's a flowing it flowed from one Church age to the other now we're going to realize that when brother R set these things up he gives us a date for each Church age when it began and when it ended but you got to remember there's a lap over of time and you also got to remember that God didn't just abruptly shut off One Church age there was a lap over there was some that was H over from this age that they lapped over into the other age but remember those people though were on the way down right because the messengers got to come and rebuke them pick them up and take them into another church age all right or another message let's say all right and we'll look at that real quick I want to uh thank Brother Anderson he sure helped me with this right here I appreciate Brother Anderson hold on no I I appreciate brother [Applause] and he's so short and unnoticeable yeah anyway all right so he was showed me how to move this back and forth I know some of you can can you see you may not see the the letters but that's kind of what brother brandham Drew and to get this thing started this is the this is the candlesticks this is all connected though to a bowl this was the old the old type where the the priest would pour the the olive oil the special oil and remember if you look in the Bible that oil was used for nothing else the Holy Ghost is not used for but one thing and that's to give you the Holy Ghost himself all right so you got that and then you got the Wicks that come out all right and he separated Ephesus ad 53 to 170 now and and to make it Church ages you got to stop it and you got to uh look at the moon phases and and it's like brother excuse me brother Louise preached one time you know this looks like a person laying down you know but he but we're to rise in the church age right here we're supposed to come up all right so this church age is the alpha Church age this church age is the Omega Church age which is the one we're in right now all right all these others in between had a dip of the Holy Ghost but they had flaws and errors all right not that they weren't Christians they just had flaws and errors because remember God said I'm going to I'm going to be Alpha and Omega he said that four times in the Book of Revelation so it must be important and I read you a little while where brother R said that is important he said he's not in the middle ones but remember what brother R saiding he's not in he was in his fullness in the first church age they didn't have Baptist and Methodist on every corner in the first church age right now we got them now but we've been called out come out of her my people on this end because guess where they got developed down through them other five Church ages in between there was a denominational idea come in and Tau him you could do whatever you wanted to do you could come to church when you wanted to you you didn't have to really go to church come as you are just come in whatever you got on and you're good and that's not what God said let me say something one time and I just want to be real clear let me put this back down thank you brother Anderson bless your heart cuz see I can look at that look at that listen I don't want Church like we said we went to the church the other day uh well we didn't have church service here I went down to the Baptist Church and it's just it's like a lodge I think sometimes we get into a point to where when we come to church I mean this church it's kind of like a uh you know family reunion which it is in a spiritual sense and but it's not a place that you can go outside and just talk any way you want to get where I'm saying and then hop into church five minutes after the church starts that's not a Christian way to do it and you brought a devil in with you didn't brother R say 20 minutes before the service start did he change that when he died I don't think he did there's a reason behind that to get your mind ready to get your thoughts not on outside there and who's going what's going on with my job and my family and my right here right it's important cuz you bring devils in with you when that door opens after 2:00 I just want when I see him I say well there comes another devil I don't mean nothing about the person but you know you didn't clear your mind out down there come on here's where you clear it out that's Twi when I said 20 minutes before service starts you ought to be in here praying you say well I got something to say it later got all other time in the world stay off your phone maybe for a little while yeah all right now look I just want because I want us to be I want it to flow I want to say I want it to flow because it doesn't flow when there's an evil spirit that's why brother rown said be here 20 minutes before the service starts we believe in everything he says until something we don't want to do and then we don't well that's not very important anyway but look this is this is a statement that that I kind of get from the whole thing the seven Church ages is a complete and Final revelation of Jesus Christ to the world now you know he goes to Israel but remember is that Israel's not bride the foolish virgin is not bride the cup of water my name is not bride we're bride right so it started on the day of Pentecost with 120 and then it ends with us taking a body change that is the complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ for this Earth in this whole 2,000 years we've been in this Gentile dispensations everybody with me all right it's not to the world the world may get eternal life you the foolish virgin will get eternal life it says it the Bible and but you got to go to the white Throne judgment but if you come to that complete final Revelation to Jesus Christ got that's why you had to have a alpha bride and Omega bride be the same it be miror image of each other all right ybody with me so this these Church ages are important it tells the character of Jesus Christ it tells everything he's doing while me and you can relate to it on this Earth we can relate to this these are real people I was thinking the other day you know we say Well church in Ephesus and we just kind of go on there was people there doctors lawyers nurses carders they were they were there working yeah maybe not car dealer donkey donkey dealers I'll stop right there cart dealers um um buggy makers and all that stuff but I'm trying I'm digging myself back out of this but um but but they were people right sitting in church service listening to Paul listening to irus listen to Martin listen to Columba and taking and being being being people right but bride took that word and held it and it made them different it put them in their own age listening to their message of the age right right right so it's not just a city because remember a city is what nothing without people a City's not build when the when the when the uh the time says all the whole city came out and watched the parade well all the you know South State Bank and First National Bank and they didn't come hopping in the city you know the the the building didn't come hopping out to the corner what was on the corner yeah I'm strange sister I'm strange it's okay who came out the people talking to you the people the people people came out not the buildings so what is the city of Ephesus it's the people that was in it and there were bride there just like you and I there's a Le out of sea out there that's blind wretched miserable and naked and they don't know it but you and I know it because we can see it by the word of God all right so these seven Church ages is a complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ John 1:14 says what is going but he's telling us and identifying I read you several quotes this morning where in in Scriptures it talks about in his flesh flesh it talks about flesh in flesh job even said in my flesh I shall see God so the thing that Satan attacked come on somebody the thing that Satan attacked he made that bride fall Eve by getting in the flesh doing something in the flesh right God's going to take that same flesh amen and he's going to defeat him on this side cuz they went to death you and I are going to a body change so John 1:14 the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the bride that was his people that was his body right a body th has prepared me what the body of Believers we know it was one man Jesus Christ but then he imparts his life to each one of us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that makes us Christ in another form called a bride we bestow all on our bride if you got a wonderful wife you try to give her the best you can you brother John's going to help us with that we going to try to get the best we can and just releases rolling her eyes he will why wouldn't you give you bride the best listen he gave us the best Church AG Messengers amen or he would have send somebody else why you know God didn't say well I think I'll send irenius and then when the irenius comes on on the scene and starts preaching and God's up there going no no no I didn't mean him I didn't mean him I get rid of him and give him somebody else he doesn't make a mistake when God said it's irenius irenius is a man you got to listen to when it says William man brandom that's the person you got to listen to I didn't say that God said it I'm going to send you a messenger that will tell you the truth right so we talked about this morning about a new dispensation which come from the old dispensation of the of the Old Testament where it was bulls and goats and dos and don'ts and this and that and God was this angry God and everything we done he just hated us brother Brown thought that you know he said I thought he said I thought Jehovah hated me but Jesus loved me he said I come to find out they're the same person they were just in a different dispensation once he got down here among flesh and was made flesh he became one of us and then being become one of us he can understand us and know what we go through all the way up so Hebrews 10: 19 says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the Holy by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way so it's all it's new I'm telling you even when you're a Christian when you're a Christian you first start your journey it's new your your your your your your you want to lean back I'm sorry I'm the only one that does that sorry y'all just bear with me please we're all humans you suck in air like I am when you started on your Christian Journey it was hard it's still hard now but back then it was like the devil's like hey beer open for business right M barel two packs for well it's about $50 now but you know two for one and that's all you saw like dad said he never drank beer in his life but he see people drink a beer after he got saved he's like well who put that in him the devil did so the devil's putting out because you know what we did the desire the devil and it was common but boy he done a change in our life and we don't do that no more and Satan don't understand that CU he keeps doing it right he can't understand how we can change or God can change us actually and give us a new desire that down inside that's what did motivate us was happy hour yeah two for one and you said and that was your conversation you talk to your friends at work you say hey two for one down at the right Mary Mary said me and you honey me and you the only two that this happens to well praise the Lord I found somebody that was K to me two for one and then they have the music and then they put the lights up and then they put the ey this up now you never even look in that direction why cuz that thing it was pulling you toward it is gone but remember the old youu is still wrapped around all that y right amen two for one margarita time n Go no funny story but I'll tell it later by a New and Living Way which hath consecrated for us brother Ernie Bill and NOA he he was with you know bless his heart we were sitting one time tell you how people think and uh we went to Longhorn in Gainesville and big old line of kids and and this has been a long time ago I think Jacob and him were still here and Josh and him and they were we all went together and big old long table at Longhorns big I mean it was we had probably 25 people or so there well everybody orders water you know good Christian thing to order water tea maybe a little uh uh Arnold Palmer every once in a while that's your mixed drink when you're a Christian for those y'all don't know that it's half lemonade and half half tea but everybody starts sitting down here and here comes and Ernie didn't just order a little one he had a a was it daer strawberry strawberry daer you for those of you that know that you're shaking your head and you're laughing some of you don't it's a mixed drink but it's got something in it but it's red I mean strawberry Red and he didn't get a little one he got one like a platter wow and here comes the L she's giv us all our stuff and here she comes with that and by the time she gets down Ernie's at the very end of the table she gets to she sets it down by the time she sets it down you could hear next [Laughter] Going H but it was what they call a virgin is there was no alcohol in it he just liked the taste of the of the uh like I ain't telling about talking about Sunday either but but but see you see the perception is but to me just to me though I would stay away from any of that because it would show somebody that didn't know now everybody sat around him was like this guy's going to have a good time here in just about 30 minutes cuz if he drinks all that he's going to have a good time well we had a good time and he he didn't have a bit of alcohol in it at all but he just liked the taste of it but you see what I mean about perception the perception was I wouldn't do that because it people would perceive that that's what I'm that that I would drinking you know alcoholic beverage but you know what it didn't bother the people sitting around the people around like whatever you know give me one of them but we've been changed by a New and Living Way We Don't e don't even enter in our mind to order that I mean how many of y'all pick up that little thing on your table that's got all the drink and you look at it to see what the price is no you take it fold it put it over here get rid of that thing don't play in don't play in don't play in The Devil's Playground he's got you when you walk in all right so the best thing to do is just get away from it but there's New Testament so this is a new way for us uh when you become a Christian there's there's thoughts and ideas and that's why it's way at the bottom you have faith and then you build up and you grow into these things as a new Christian we make mistakes listen as an old Christian you make mistakes but but I hope we don't make the ones that we may have made every how many years ago all right everybody with me yeah I'll say that too because of our memory right so this new testament or this New Covenant or this new will is coming to effect Jesus is going there's only one person that can bring it into effect and that's the Lord amen like we're going to take communion he took the cup and he told him said this is my blood of the New Testament then he said what this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me this cup of the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me all right it's not blood it's wine but it's a symbolics it's a symb just like water baptism and all it's a symbol it shows the world right all right and and and I'll just you know we all honest and we all human beings when you we start taking communion that door H just gets hot the people leaving you shouldn't I mean you should if you don't want to take it but if you're not going to take it just say I'm not going to take it I mean I'd come to church and I just say no but that shows the world that you're not ready to take it and that you're maybe not a Christian or maybe you got some problems or some issues listen we're just humans I want every everybody take communion I wish you could lock that back door but I wish everybody just take it when it's given to you and you say Thank You Lord and you pick that up you pick the wafer up you don't have any no I don't know these are ordinances that we should do right as a Christian we do them anyway all right if you don't do them then check yourself up even brother Ram said if you got something you need to take care of he said if you're a Christian take communion then go get it figured out or straightened out which whatever is in your mind cuz every one of us have things in our mind that's why we have a moment of Silent prayer to them demons y'all brought in when you was late hello somebody you can get them out the door before you take communion before you take of the spirit get rid of the spirit Hebrews 9:11 says Christ being become a high priest of good good things to come by a greater more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us now this is a guy named Paul right Paul like I said before Paul lived over in this section the Old Testament section before he got born again then he come into a New and Living Way over here and he's saying hey that's okay for that time but that dispensation is over there's a new and better way a New and Living Way that comes to humanity not through an animal right for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkle the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ keep you out of happy hour all right same thing right who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience I purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also necessity be the death of that person that makes the testimony or the test or the will I mean listen how many of you have went to the went to the lawyer's office and and read a will and the person that wrote it sitting beside you no he's usually gone right he or she's usually gone but they have left you something well praise God somebody did the same thing but he's Eternal and he gave you eternal life and then he did pass out gifts cuz in his will there is gifts that we should take full advantage of this year we should take full advantage of of all the gifts all nonp spiritual gifts wisdom and all the different things speaking in tongues is fine when it's done right for a testament is a fourth after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth what you think you'd be a lawyer sitting there you know and you get ready to read the will and the person that wrote it sitting there well the lawyer is going to go I can't read this the guy's still here y'all not know he's in the room he had to be gone so Christ had to go away so he could come back and give us a will all right 2 Corinthians 3:1 says you're our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart wow who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament there is a bride there is a fivefold Ministry that will take us to Perfection God promised it as brother Dell said a long time ago they are predestinated to take somebody to a body change it will happen you can sit there and deny you can quit coming to church you can sit there and deny everything it'll happen you know why CU you can't change will and the will said it was going to happen that's what I put my faith in I don't put my faith me you and nobody else I put my faith right here that's right right here and that brother said Faith final resting place is right here right why I told that brother day was talking about Daniel 70 weeks I said you got to show it to me in the Bible the way you preach it well I got this I don't care about the quotes right sorry they stood one day and says we have Moses quote book Jesus said if you didn't known Moses You' know me cuz in that quotebook you got I'm in it I'm just now in flesh and you can't see it that's why they hated him that's why I killed him they killed him and they'll persecute us the same way cuz the son of man's going to be back again in power I believe that with all my heart amen where we'll speak the word and it'll happen you don't have to pray and work something up boy why get silent Peter and James were walking down a road they weren't in a prayer meeting they probably were coming back from Walmart with in their car no they were walking probably talking about the Lord and talking about things and they look at a guy and see him sitting there and he can't get up he's been there for day for years arms for the poor arms for the poor Peter said hey look on us he said I ain't got enough money in my pocket I'm sure Peter probably had holes in his pocket he a fisherman unlearned he didn't go he said man I got I got $20 here go to the doctor and get that fixed he said Silver and Gold Have i n but such as I already have I ain't got to go get it what I have I give to you rise up on your feet and walk in the name of Jesus Christ didn't have to work anything up there wasn't a bunch of music in the background right amen who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life like what Brother Richard negr was saying the other day you know he was he knew he had the spirit he was looking for the truth but when he saw the message being preached here he saw spirit and truth and put them together and he said that's the person I need to listen to How many of you got that Revelation not to one person but but the ministry is what you got to listen to for if the ministration of condemnation be glory dos and don'ts much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory praise God for Grace that's what God brought he brought Grace there was even Grace in the Old Testament David would have died had it not been for grace of a prophet saying David you won't die that's right cuz David proclaimed as a king he proclaimed his own judgment on himself that's right remember that's right the prophet Nathan gave him the whole scenario and he said oh bring him here to that man will die Nathan said you're the man but David I prayed for you praise God we had a prophet pray for us amen we'll make it we'll make it but in those sacrifices there's remembrance again made of sin every year each each time you talk about in the old test Testament for it's not possible that the blood of bulls and the goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayith sacrifice and offerings over here thou wouldest not but now I need a body I got to have a body to work through all right and you and I now are that body that he has prepared on the Earth today to defeat Satan with and burnt offering the sacrific for sin thou had us no pleasure then I say Lord I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will it was already in the well it's in the well now how God's going to orchestrate this whole thing through me and you amen then he said lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish in other words don't do away with the Old Testament listen don't do away with all these ordinances I know Paul said you know um getting rid of all you don't get rid of the word of God you build on the word of God all right let us go on to Perfection Paul says not laying again you know all the different things of of water baptism and all that yeah you don't need you don't have to preach water baptism every service but you do kind of weave it in every once in a while for the ones that need it then he said lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second but this man after he offered one sacrifice for sin forever he sat down on the right hand of God what is the right hand of God the power where is the power of God at the moment didn't the bride right what you you tell me where it is anywhere else right see you ought to know it's in US amen it's not anywhere else that's right from henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his foot stols and how is he going to do that through his bride for by one offering Heath perfected forever them that are Sanctified Hebrews 10:19 said by a New and Living Way We read this before which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh so everything's coming through his flesh everything she is him all the scriptures speaks to the bridegroom speaks to the bride we we've had a prophet tell us that and Proclaim it so let's believe it all right Revelations 1: 18 says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty then John continues down and until he's one more time verse 11 I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last all right what thou see us right in the book now and send it to the seven churches Ephesus Smyrna all the way through so so God didn't just say all right give it to Ephesus and give it to leosa no you're going to give it to all seven but my first one is going to be important because that's the way I want my church to start and the last one I will restore sayith the Lord he's going to restore back right here right in this age we're living in now amen then he turned around saw the seven candlesticks as we were showing try to skip through now remember I think we all understand that that that person that was standing there that John saw was in a form called The Bride G about the pouch a belt of gold around this breast not down here not priest but up here through the bride brother Brown says look G about the PS not a man a woman called the son of man all right he was not a priest during this time neither was he a king he was a judge see listen who crowns him king of kings and Lord of lords the foolish virgin cup of water in my name Person giv eternal life at why Throne judgment who crowns him King of Kings we do then he shares that with us cuz we have crowns too remember notice the priest the high priest when he went to the sanctuary and went to minister to service he tied himself around the waist tying his girdle around the waist meant he was in service never tied it over his shoulder but here he comes out walking out with the girdle tied around the top with a sash over his shoulder gted about the PS the breast with a golden girdle gted up high what is he attorney an attorney a judge the judge with his sash over his shoulder GED up here not down as a priest now now watch what brother R he interjects now an attorney what is an attorney he can be for you or he can be against you but if the attor attorney the judge the jury are all the same person he can't change so he's for you the whole time amen the judge with his sash over his shoulder gted up here not down as a priest see that shows he wasn't in his priesthood now John all the way over into the Lord's day and saw him coming as the judge mark of the beast 1954 now I'm going to pull the chart back up here in just a minute we found the church standing there in its beauty Christ just molded into it he's talking about Revelations chapter 1 and the church had a white garment on and you notice it was a woman around the breast it had the Garment covering over her shame and had a golden cord though pulled around like that held around the breast white speaking of the righteousness of Christ and the golden cord representing the gospel the preaching of the Gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the church the righteousness of Christ that's what we come to church for not to see each other not to be seen not to be heard but we can talk to God and he can talk to us brings the Holy Spirit over the church the righteousness of Christ holds it there tied with the string the girdle TR in time of evangelism now let's set forth the ages here real quick and then we'll get down from omiga each age has had its message and its messenger all through the times every age has packed its message with a messenger god in every dispensation has sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit not a different Holy Spirit but Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time all right even from the beginning watch this I didn't read this this morning even from the beginning God was the messenger in the beginning now I ask you a question did they do what he said no they did not do what he said God himself told them eat of this one don't eat of that one they went right over there and ate that one you shall eat this but you shall not do this that was the message all right so see that was a message all right they didn't come under their messenger and what happened death happened right that was the message and when man stepped across the message of the hour it brought death and chaos to the whole human race now that's how much the message means and remember that wasn't just a complete blank denial of what God said that he believed it was taking what God Said and whitewashing it over or just misconstruing it a little bit just adding a little bit or taking a little bit from it 1963 God gave his word so much here so much here so much here he's look I believe he's pointing at the church ages and he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass and it supports the other one that was coming brother B never denied Luther he never denied all them he used every one of them because God was in every move that there was and and then he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass and it supports the other one that was coming see like the Messiah always supported every prophet in his own life his own being the word that was given for that day he come and fulfill that written word and foretold of what the other one was going to be now who the brother around now I'm going to ask you a question who did he foretell the coming of an end time bride the coming of an end time bride that was going to be the final voice of the final age not just one person standing up no no that brother Brandon was the prophet all right the holy ghost is now the prophet he was in every age anyway and every one of them spoke of him he was the head of the prophets he was the word of God he was the prophets notice how wonderful what he was each one of these prophets now let's continue on down only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to to that age and that one messenger is the messenger look to the true church cuz what he's going to do is once he sounds his message he is immediately going to cause a war like some of y'all are losing the Sleepy War but he's bringing a message and the true church is going to take it and and they're going to be what they're going to be blessed by iten but everybody else it starts a spiritual war and then I'll read it to you in a minute brother R says a temporary judgment is placed even on the earth listen the reason a lot of these things has happened in the United States brother Ram said it would happen there's nowhere in the Bible that says there'll be an earthquake that'll destroy California right but there'll be earthquake in diverse places is in the Bible right many diverse many places that' be earthquake had one just the other day did you read that yesterday I meant to call Claude I think he must have fell out of the bed he was a 5.1 in Oklahoma City I'll call him and ask him I was going to yesterday but I didn't have time but they had in Oklahoma City right in the middle of the United States of America a 5.1 earthquake shook stuff all over the place wow earthquakes in diverse places but brother R stood that day and he said oh Los Angeles thou City of Angels in other words he what he was saying was what I preached in California you have turned it down and God is going to put a judgment on you cuz he's not going to slide Georgia and Tennessee and all them off and they're going to be slid off cuz they turned the word down the message is then broadcast to all now look brings to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the church is though he preached to the denominational churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of the messenger those who here are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God amen the first seal now brother br's getting ready to preach the seals the first Seal's coming up he's he's going to set everything in order because he's already preached the church ages and he preached the breach between the church ages and the seals he's going to bring this and put them all together so just shake yourself for a moment and hang on now notice but it's to be revealed when the lamb leaves his intercessory place from the father now that's Revelations 5 now he takes the book of seals the book of seals are a book sealed with seals breaks them and shows them at the End of the Age now after the intercessory is over the church ages has done finished up he comes in the first age the he an age revealed sent a messenger notice what happens as we go along now listen pay attention this is going to help us when we get through the go through the church ages it's going to give you the character of what's going to happen all right here's the plan of it the first thing happens there's an announcement in the heavens first John I'm sending seven Messengers to seven Church agents right right that's what I'm going to do not doing anything different that's what I'm going to do what happened a seal is opened what is that a mystery is unfold let me give you a little secret Paul I don't think he thought I am the first church A's Messenger to Ephesus irenius probably didn't wake up one day and said I am the church AIDS messenger to Smyrna I'm and then they're all going I'm the no they didn't they just lived a life Abraham just lived his life okay the only thing we done is now we're at the end looking back and we've got a prophet in the end time that told us who these people were you can see the characteristics and the continuity of God in each one of the church ages when a mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds what a message it declares a war when Jesus came on Earth there was a war you know the Prince of Peace one day he stood up and he he said I didn't come to bring peace hello he said I come to bring a sword mother against father sister against brother he knew it would divide him but there was nothing he could do about it he had to come and preach the word brother R knew the denominations would throw him out Paul knew he'd be stoned Paul knew he probably was going to get his head cut off what is the war a plague Falls and a church age open see what is the war part the angel of the church now watch catches the mystery of God now look not the mystery of all the denomination he gets the revelation of God so immediately he's going to be separated from that church over there not just without that one I mean from the church he come out of like Luther but look not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God then he goes forth to the people after mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do out there he begin he proclaims his message and what does it start it starts a spiritual war and then God takes his messenger with that elect of that age Lays them away of sleep drops a plague upon them who rejects it a temporary judgment there's your Sevenfold person cuz remember he was judge and then after that is over then he goes on and they denominate bring in denominations and start off with that man's work like Wesley and all the rest of them then it gets all in a scrapple again because you got a church age messenger comes he preaches he goes off the scene and as soon as he goes off the scene irenius picks the message up has a Revival brings a group how a how a spiritual war irus God says all right Martin it's your time Martin takes what ireneus has and he keeps they keep pulling right pull from the other one listen they're not Church a messengers of Faith did Ne one before right right they can't do that that's right that's why polycarp would have been according to brother brandham he would have been one of the church A's Messengers but he said the Holy Spirit revealed to him that as in Paul he got away from all that stuff and and polycarp just leaned a little bit toward organized religion I said leaned a little toward it so he wasn't a church age messenger but ireneus didn't all right and then another mystery comes forth what happens another messenger arrives on Earth for a church age then he arrives the trumpet sounds he declares a war and then what happens finally then he's caught away and then when he's laid away then plagues fall destroys them listen spiritual death hits the church as soon as that church a messenger as soon as you turn him down you've turned God down youve turned God down you not turn that messenger down right then people that saying all brother around this and that they're turning God down they're not turning him down right spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then he goes on to another one Revelations 1 ver8 I Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end sayith the Lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty saying I am Alpha verse 11 and Omega the first and the last what thou seeth right in the book and send it unto the seven churches in Asia then he names them all now listen the alpha church was what Ephesus right everybody with me the Omega Church is leosia everybody with me the alpha the beginning and the end beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation there was a beginning on the day of Pentecost then there's going to be an ending with us going into Rapture all right let's read this right here now if you'll notice the candlesticks didn't set quite like that they started down in this way and came up as we were showing a minute ago the highest one here away from here he was standing was this one up here and Christianity gradually smothered out watch this Christianity gradually smothered out as it went from where he was in the standing in the shape of the Cross Alpha Omega these Church ages started going down right see that that white in that little ball is is the the Believers this is the unbelief this is the Believers of the world this is the unbelievers look how it keeps taking over till you get to this age then it starts getting a little more light and I remember brother BR was one it drew light this was supposed to be totally dark praise God for a prophet amen that could do that and God was didn't say no no no don't do that he said uh that's what you should have done but you see how it took over n and all the different ones the sayings the Deeds the doctrin we'll get into all that later on but it almost comes completely out in Columba that middle age the fourth age all right so you got Ephesus we look Paul arenus Martin Columba Luther Wesley and Elijah the Seven Stars and we'll show you on another chart later on how that works because remember brother R said the messenger comes at the end of the age all right to what to enter to do what I said bring his message rebuke the previous ones bring his message start a war have a spiritual war that war continues on and then you have another messenger coming up all right but we don't have one so we're it this is it we're it Coca-Cola is not it we are all right so now let's read real quick now right here he had his hand on this church and on that church he was both Alpha and Omega and of course all was in between the two all the other letters the letters that were written all right everybody with me so he's not denying that God wasn't in those Church ages he's just saying God's got his hand on this one to start it right God has got his hand on this one to end it right all right listen it didn't begin with the false Doctrine it's not going to end with one amen but he specifically said Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow over his head which was what his Covenant now if you notice the light of Pentecost where it started gradually smothered out now we just showed it to you these men irenius polycarp he even announced his polycarp because polycarp was part of it but he wasn't a messenger all the rest of them sealed their testimony with their own blood until it finally squeezed Christianity into the darkest of days now look the first age the other side of that great hump coming over was a little bit of light more light than more light then how it begins to shine again coming into that day now at the end of this age it's predicted here that it come to a lay out of sin a lukewarm I like what brother um Isaac was bringing he's been going through the church ages if you'll look I look back in the in the history Lea is here and then there's two other cities right here Lea did not have any water they had no water system right they depended on the other two well one of them was in hot spring and one of them was cold deep well and they pumped it to lay out of se but when you take hot water and cold water and put it together what do you get lukewarm they drank literally those people in that age drank lukewarm water now here it is first thing he did to them why why would we want that down here in Pentecost talking about lukew why would we want it down here sardian Church age then if that was Christ's Holy Spirit coming on to the day of Pentecost now look that did those things it's Christ's Holy Spirit been pushed out through the church ages Christ's Holy Spirit still holding in here Christ Holy Spirit still holding here on down here until the end of the world the same holy spirit that filled Paul with the Holy Ghost and the things that he done will fill this one irenius full of the Holy Ghost Martin full of the Holy Ghost fill the rest of them full of the Holy Ghost and it filled you and I full of the Holy Ghost and it's a Pentecostal blessing from one Church age to the other Alpha and Omega the end and the beginning Philadelphian Church age brother R said look he had his hands out in the form of a cross he said I am Alpha and Omega in other words I will be Supreme in the first and I will be Supreme in the last the light rises in the east and sets in the west same light it's been a dismal dark time but it shall be light in the evening time the same Gospel Power that raised up here on one hand at the East has shined over and now on the other hand at the West Alpha and Omega I am I'm a and I am Z in his hands you get it now watch this now what did he do in the first chapter of Revelations he revealed his Supreme deity to the first church remember they they were were not trinitarians at all right none now it did start creeping in but none is that right well now notice every one of these churches coming down through here he revealed himself in deity what only in his glorified form not in his fullness that's where you can explain he came in his fullness here and he's coming back into his fullness here but down through the church ages he was in his glorified form he was in his bride but only in a portion but on this last one he becomes Z back to the original beginning again see the first and the last the first days now the last days where he said I am the first and the last Masterpiece 1964 brother rown said the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the second or last message is the same thing I was in Alpha I in Omega there'll be a day that won't be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light see Alpha and Omega has become the first and the last back to the Masterpiece but you notice the church only came in he's talking about remember brother R had a vision saw one set of Bride come across into Vision right right then coming was the rock and roll twisty naked women look like a witch right coming in here twisting and turning and what going off into chaos then he was just so distraught he said Lord is this it is this all this all I've done is this it he said hang on a minute yeah the bride will come into preview again amen so here comes the bride that was dressed right amen so watch what he said but you notice the church only came into view one time church amen but the Bride come twice that's right Alpha Omega see what it is now not knowing it but look at it with my message this morning the seed fell in the ground at NAA that was the original seed and she's come through the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she is in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time and she will be reviewed the second time she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy all others never appeared no more they went out and never came back again but the bride came back cuz she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for is a piece of his it was a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden and took a piece from made another piece that was Mar and fell now he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten in order that part was smitten was in order to bring back again that Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece and the Son of God the Masterpiece and the Bride is a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word all right now if you got your Bibles we'll finish right here now what have I been telling for the last 30 minutes Alpha and Omega everybody with me Alpha bride and Omega bride that's the two that that's the two premere God said it four times in about three verses I mean three chapters I'm Alpha and I'm Omega all right open your Bible to Revelations 2 verse one if you don't have one that's okay cuz I got it up here for you I want you to watch cuz remember he said I started my church this way and I'm going to end it this way I'm going to have church in between but I'm going to specify these two churches amen all right watch how he had it written in the Bible all right you'll get your Bible out you wake up all right now look Revelations 2 verse one first church age now watch now your Bible may not say this but this is the King James version I'm reading from all right unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write is that what he says in yours yes now let's skip to Revelations 2:8 it changes and unto the angel of the church in Smyrna right anybody with Meen Revelations 2:12 to the angel of the church in pergamus say is that what he says in yours Revelations 2:18 the angel of the church in thara Revelations 3:1 says to the angel of the church in Sardis all right everybody got that Revelations 3:7 andto the angel of the church in Philadelphia so you would think that when we get to Revelations 3:14 it would say in it said in the other five except the first one first one said what of so now let's read Revelations 3:14 last Church AG unto the angel of the Church of the lead of sins right was samon the first right same in the last the other ones were in you didn't see that that's why I preach it's like Len y said he said why do you sing he said I sing for those that can and can't but mostly for the ones that can't so Ephesus was what the verbiage is different in Ephesus and leosia is the same but it during the other five it says in and see that might not be significant to you but God's word is exactly perfect he can't say I was Alpha and Omega and then bring them all together and to the angel of the Church of the loud of sins right Ephesians says what to the angel of the Church of Ephesus all the other ones are in Alpha and Omega the beginning the Beginning church and the ending Church you and I know the characteristics then of all the other Church ages but you should know that in this age the Bride of Jesus Christ is is and is acting like the bride in the first church age no denominational idea no theology no um uh getting away from the messenger like they're trying to do now right but Ephesus was the way God started his church there was a Pentecostal blessing fell on the day of Pentecost 120 people received the Holy Ghost the Ephesian Church age started some somewhere around there is everybody with me all right now we got over here in the end time and we'll show it in a little bit we got a seventh messenger over here what appears before the age begins Pentecost 1906 is USA Street the gifts are being restored back no messenger of the age brother rown said the Holy Ghost come himself then what then the L of In messenger steps on the scene just like Paul stepped on the scene right after Pentecost even brother brandham says and declares in 1950 on that tape that you can watch he says I was born out of due season born out of due time in other words I should have been born back in that Pentecostal age cuz no Paul is back here and he says the same thing if you'll look in the Bible I can't remember we'll get it later he says I was born out of due season in other words I should have been in the upper room that's why when we read that scripture in Corinthians about the about the U communion he wasn't there but he wrote the most clear of anybody that was there because the ones that were there didn't have the Holy Ghost right and the devil was among them right the devil to communion oh we don't have that today but there was a Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Ghost and then the messenger com first one now there's a Pentecostal outpouring back in 1906 then a messenger come there's your two book ends there's your Alpha and Omega there's your of and of but everything else is truly the Holy Ghost don't don't get me wrong they all had the Holy Ghost all right one more quote let's stand to our feet come on in whoever's doing the communion now this is a uh when brother brownon went across a curtain of time he was talking to the angel and he said you were born a leader the angel says that and I said well will everyone be responsible he said every leader I said' what about St Paul why'd he pick Paul because he preached what Paul preached that's what he said I said what about St Paul said he'll be responsible for his AIDS well I said I preach the same gospel he did and millions of voices raised and said we are resting upon that see there you are resting so the angel of God the messenger to the church is responsible if he preaches not the word if he don't preach the word of God he's not a messenger but he's not he's responsible but the messenger to the church that preaches the truth he's responsible for his group of people all right you love the Lord that's how God is in continuity he's in his power in the beginning he's in power at the end they're going to have to match brother R couldn't preach now listen hold on a minute brother R couldn't preach come and preach Luther's message he preached about him preached through his message of justification everybody with me but he didn't say Luther's my man Luther had all of it he never said that but he said Paul did Paul's my man I preached everything Paul preached and everybody saying we're resting on that so he put his dependency on that he if he preached what Paul preached which was the alpha messenger then the Omega messenger must be him it must be something over here that he's doing if God thought enough for Paul to put him in a church age and put him in the in the uh sixth Dimension along with his people he said well if Paul made it cuz I preached exactly what Paul said he did he preached man he he preached exactly what Paul said then he was resting and we're resting that he did preach what Paul preached cuz Paul wrote 80% of the New Testament right you love the Lord can you pull that scripture up brother Anderson you back there and we'll go to the communion 1 Corinthians 11:23 appreciate all of you and love you pray for the ones that are not here ones that are coming back pray for brother Bob uh he'll be speaking Wednesday night and then uh next week we got normal service and then the Saturday after that will be the Valentine's banquet so uh and if you need somebody uh to keep your kids kind of asked around I think my daughter's going to keep a few and and Hannah and U if you need somebody to keep the kids uh ask around and uh we'll try to get you somebody to uh to uh keep them make sure you sedate them before you bring them there and uh kids are kids y'all get sedated let's take communion you love the Lord he's good to us he's good to show us his continuity he's good to show us what age we're in I mean we are just totally we know where we're at a lot of the other ages didn't know where they was at we know where we're at and we know why we're here I know why I'm here you ought to know why you're here right we're here to see this thing to the coming of the Lord to the ending of the Gentile dispensation not the ending of Christianity 144,000 are going to be Christians they're just not going to be bride they've lost that position but you and I have not lost it even when Luther was preaching trinitarian Doctrine God didn't lose a one he winked at their ignorance cuz he said I got one coming just like the one I started with and that group of people is going to take this thing over the hump and we're going to get out of here run through a a troop and leap over a wall we're going to run through it we're not going to walk we're going to be running let's bow our heads just for a minute dear Lord thank you for this day you've give us appreciate the word Lord that we that we can sit down and even in our in our homes we can we can press play and we can read books and we can we can listen to tapes but Lord I pray that you'd make that a manifestation in our life Quicken it to our Heart Lord that it won't be just letters on a page that it'll be something that that we cherish and hold on to Lord more than anything father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make against you Lord cleanse us Lord the communion is something a time to for us to all as Christians check up on oursel make sure we're doing the right thing make sure that that all the unclean has gone out of us and and that Lord we're walking in a Sanctified life even after our new birth we still have to stay clean father forgive us Lord our mistakes Lord that we make if in the message Lord and the different things Lord I pray that you'd bless the ones that are here Lord that's hearing from you Lord I pray that You' touch them raise them up take them up that statue of perfect man Lord put them on top of that mountain top and father be with us Lord this whole week coming up we know Satan's going to throw his guns at all of us but we pray Lord that you would give us a shield you already have that we can hold that Shield up and say devil not today and you can walk as the Bible says in newness of Life a New and Living Way thank thank you Lord for giving us that the world's had new stuff and new technology and all that's all as the prophet of God said when they created gunpowder it's killed millions they created cars for us to drive it's killed billions of people every time man's created something to try to make Advance herself it just ends up up killing people but Lord Jesus you Advanced your word of God and it's not killed anybody it's made him alive and it's taught us how to live and how to breathe Lord I pray that you'd bless each one father as we partake of this communion in Jesus name amen 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23-34 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you now this is Paul talking about what happened and he wasn't there that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he also took the cup and we Su saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes all right wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning who is the Lord's body you and I are for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now look but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world in other words your judgment is not going to be their judgment right mm no separate wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's have a moment of Silent prayer praying for each one and the Lord will help us at his church bind us together thank you Lord thank you for these that have assembled today Lord and I pray that someone has been touched by Your Word Lord and we'll take this forward and defeat the Devil with it in Jesus name amen Bible said he took bread and blessed it dear Lord thank you so much we've come to this place where it's been dedicated to you Lord made by holy hands not made with anything but just water and and uh flour Lord and I pray that that's a symbol of the word we just preached that there was nothing added no leaven to make it rise and and Lord It's Made it's not made to be even to be something to desire we want to eat every meal it should be something that Taken like you did Lord on the cross Lord they tried to give you vinegar and and you you didn't take it Lord because you told us that you wern't going to do any of that drinking of the vine until we come to the end father I pray that you'd sanctify this in Jesus name amen yeah it's interesting to uh um even the ordinances um that they did back then how it got convoluted and then now they just take cut over grape juice and and uh and they you know order some uh something from the uh looks like a little bitty puffy little cracker and and that's the way they've done with the word of God they've diluted it so much from the original till it don't even look like the original now listen the original church we should look like that original church that's why we dress the way we do and act the way we do it's because we're back to the original everything in between God winked at ignorance absolutely but now remember what God say though but when the word presented to you what are you going to do with it all right when the word presented to you what are you going to do with it cuz you can't say I I you didn't tell me that no like I said before you know it there's ordinances in this church and I don't say this church building in the church that brother Brown put in place by the scripture to tell us how to run a church and pretty simple you ain't got to ask nobody else you ain't got to ask another bishop or somebody like that you got the word of God to do it with and you got the prophet's message to give us Clarity he come to bring us another Bible he come to give us Clarity to what was already been written so we don't live under another book we live under the Bible but it's the Hess of the completeness of the Bible Lord Jesus thank you for this wine father it was a privilege to make it Lord and watch it ferment and work Lord I pray that you sanctify it to the people and they'll realize Lord that that this fruit of the vine Lord gets better and better it it doesn't get worse it gets better father the same way with the word of God it just keeps getting better and better father just bless this in Jesus name amen amen come morning I walk by the river how rest the Ever Green Tree I will carry my cross through the [Music] midnight come morning you know this is the darkest time but for the Bel it's the brightest time what a paradox sometimes I'm despised and rejected true Christians are anyway and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and he gives me the strength to go on come morning boy what a morning it won't be another day when that when that morning comes brother John it'll be another it won't be another day we don't know what rest is we may take tonight and lay down a head on the pillow but your body still doing this your mind still doing this and when you get up the next morning sometimes you're as tired as you were when you went to sleep just think brother boy that ain't going to happen no more when that morning happens that we're just talking about right we can't even fathom that there won't be a Monday nowhere praise the Lord I got a word too guys our worst day on at the post office is on Monday but God's give us all this but he give us an example to do until he come all right don't ever think that we're too high and mighty that we don't have to take communion or do the ordinances of God brother Dale has always told us us he always told us he said if somebody's got a message and they bring a message and it don't line up with all the Bible if there some new thing and you ain't got to do this and you ain't got to do that and we're looking at sinless Perfection and we're looking at seven people coming and giv us seven messages and and all Christ has already come so we it doesn't matter how many wives we have and it doesn't matter about my marriage and divorce situation yeah it does this will be sticky until we get out of here like I said before to be a change like this that's when the sin curse will be over with not before come on not before as long as you needing to needing to eat and having bad thoughts you're not changed but there'll come a day amen I like that song There's coming today when no heartaches will come yes yeah sure yeah I know well that's why the scripture sets us apart from the world you see where it says the world has a condemnation if you if you just continue to in your brain and thought about right now well oh I run that guy off the road I I I I've said something about my sister or brother I shouldn't have done well like I said you got a chance to get it right but take communion but if you don't get it right the Bible says you eat and drink damnation to yourself and some of some people will fall asleep that means death if y'all didn't know that am sister Julie yeah I know okay confession good for the soul but it it my me it's not is not true though J both of you you come in here you you probably would couldn't even tell me what songs were sung at beginning of church see what I mean I didn't even clear mine with that beautiful preaching I just did I love honesty but no really we are human beings and we are human beings that we we we understand Humanity cuz that's what we are and if I was to just like when when Lise was singing only believe and I come from my car and walked in the door and just walked up here and stood in it' been a horrible thing put it back there go in your closet get rid of the stuff you say I can't get rid of it well that's the problem you can't get rid of it but if you give it to God and say look God I'm doing what you told me to do you told me to assemble myself with Believers you told me to come in the congregation and pray read my Bible and study and that you would visit us we wonder we wonder we say you know here I go again people that that that their lives are like I can't ever I can't this I can't I can't ever have you ever started trying to just do the little things cuz most of you that said that I don't see in church half the time start with the simple things the simple things cuz remember it's the little SP foxes that spoil the vine if we start with what brother rown say he said if you've done everything you know to do now every one of you know to be at church and every one of you need to need know that you need to be here 20 minutes ahead of time cuz that's what brother R said in 1950 most of us weren't even born during that time but he said if you've done everything you're supposed to do stand you just got to make sure you've done everything you're supposed to do you wonder why your world's in chaos ain't my fault ain't my fault ain't brother Dale's fault he's fault for 50 years Tred to get y'all straightened out he's done a good job amen people are learning people learning we we we've got a good foundation and we appreciate that we appreciate the the time that we're having now and sister Julie thank you for your honesty cuz you were the one I was talking about well they know that cuz they came in late but you see that though you don't think we stand up here and we're just like oh we're just going to preach and no we see a spirit we don't see a black thing you know I I pray God never let us see that or know the thoughts of your mind right but you can see reactions when you say something either your head goes down before you go to sleep even your head goes down or some will look over against the wall like I'm not really here I'm outside that door right there listen folks we're humans and we're one big family and we love each other but we have to be chasen just they didn't say we were chasen of the Lord and you have to be chasen through a minister that's why you need a live five-fold Ministry not press play people cuz you know what press play you can do it 30 minutes after service starts you can be drinking coffee and watching YouTube oh sorry Netflix I don't have okay now work conf fasting let's go come on we you preach about it a lot so they assume you do so now they know you don't so you're preaching on somebody else's Spirit out there in the congregation right yes yeah that's right I used I know you did but that's what we do what the Bible say confess your sins what one to the other confess your sins one to the other the problem is is we go out there and we tell everybody else about what's going on in here when we're supposed to be judging here all right I'm sorry let's take communion you love the Lord you got to love his word and what he told us to do that Wine's not bad is it let's pull out the pull up the uhu scripture for the U foot washing CU that we believe in all the ordinances here we we believe that Jesus looked at Peter and he said if I don't do this to you and you don't do it to me you don't have no part with me i''d be like God going you know I said well I'm going to be in these Church ages I'm going on vacation no he was in everyone he worked in everyone thank God he doesn't get tired cuz he'd be real tired a lot of us me included right but he's not he's Bible said he's what longsuffering and we sang that song either today or or the other day I think it was today brother Aaron was singing it sister Gail always told me cuz you know we'd we'd be talking about something and she said now you know brother way God's arm is really long I said yes sister Gil but it does have an end his arm may be long but he's got a hand out there at the end of it and it's going to stop he's only going to put up with so much that's right so let's read the footw watching scripture let's just do his ordinance that listen if you love the Lord if if if he's your bridegroom if he's your husband do what he says and suffer being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas this carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED himself what here servant he tied it around his waist he didn't tie it up here he tied around his waist as a servant after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to WIP him with a towel where withth he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him thou shal never don't ever tell the Lord never he'll make you eat that never word all right that and your grandkids Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered said if I don't wash your feet you have no part with me Peter Peter said hey wash me all he didn't say well bless God I ain't no he said wash me all Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean everywh and you are clean but not all for he knew cuz Judas was there he knew who should betray him therefore he said you not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you that's a question you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet in other words if I created your feet create cre the ground I'm wiping off with created the CL the cotton to make the towel with I created the water I created the Basin I created this thing room that you were in I created you if I can do that and humble myself to do that you ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verely verely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things sad are you if you do them it says happy let your face show it happy are you if you do them I'm happy I don't like when we don't get communion like I said I was going to maybe go to next Sunday but no we're here we're going to have communion we're going to have foot washing because the people that were supposed to be here they're here and we're going to get a blessing off of it all right so God bless you let's by our heads Lord thank you for this day thank you for the the brothers and sisters that you put before us Lord that we can speak to Lord the cream of the the crop the pride of your hand over here on this side the Omega bride Lord I pray that you'd be with each one father and as we go down and wash feet Lord remember that we're washing your feet and Lord I pray that you'd be with each one Lord on the highways the ones that are traveling now coming back home Lord I pray that you bring them back safe give us them traveling mercies and Lord give us of your Holy Spirit more than anything Lord a refilling a Revival that starts in our heart Lord I
