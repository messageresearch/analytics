take hours trying to get him back amen so when we're free let's keep running amen praise the lord he was requested of me to sing this song that same spirit that raised jesus up from the grave amen

thank you lord jesus amen that same spirit that same spirit that said let there be it's dwelling deep with inside of our heart good to be in the house of the lord good to have each and every one of you here with us today good to be in service yes god bless you the ones downstairs the ones that are watching in the ones are out around the car may the lord be with you and keep you safe in this journey that we're in i think it's uh i think it's checkup time we every every place we go and everything we do is just so much uncertainty and so much well i don't know if i can do this and i don't know if i can do that and i don't know if this is right and i don't know if that's right the only thing you might write yourself the only thing you make right is yourself and that's what we're we're all striving to do i think is is as we grow up with god then i think it makes us realize that um as the prophet of god told us that that many times that you know if you feel like there's something in your heart that you need to take care of you need to take care of it and i think it's maybe a little bit of checkup time with all of us that if there's anything that's i don't want nothing to hinder me don't want nothing to hinder the spirit of the lord moving in the building prophet of god said un one unconfessed sin could make the whole congregation barely fail so you know we need to just be sensitive about each other uh this is just coming from me this is knowing not an incident that's happened it's just that we all need to check up just shake out you know let god clean you out sometimes the flus gets stopped up amen and who can unstop the flus the lord jesus cannot stop the flush but you got to ask him because he won't do it on his own because he's a very timid gentleman the holy spirit is and he will only come as you ask him to come amen but we thank god for that that we know that we have access to that holy spirit we have access to the same man that said let there be that we're going to talk about today if we get to it but just remember us all in our prayers pray for brother joe i just talked to him he has crossed the florida line heading toward the mouse trap called disney world josh asked me about 30 something years ago i guess or 20 something years ago he said dad when can we come back here i said when you can drive haven't been since so and i think he's been maybe a few times but i'm not going back didn't leave anything down there and um don't won't go find anything that's down there but just you know brother joe they've got kids i mean i'm not belittling anybody if you want to go that's okay but but he's on his way down there so let's pray that everything will be fine with them also remember next sunday as brother dale said we'll have communion second service after second service we will have a communion and we'll decide whether to uh we'll you know gather here or gather downstairs or gather out in the parking lot so we'll just show up we'll figure out what to do when you get here amen um and don't miss communion and wednesday night brotherdale's already said i'll be preaching so just remember that trying to get through the list here remember the uh brother kenny capps boy they they're putting pins in his leg now he's in surgery uh brother joe's been kind of keeping up with brother kenny with that one and then remember the family of the boy that died brother neil storm a good friend of ours from brother mike oltek's church that was his grandson 17 years old or 15 years old so we praying for the family but it strikes home a little bit more when you know i know brother louise knows brother brother neil well a beautiful wonderful man the song leader down to brother mike holt so just remember him that was his grandson that was his daughter's child so we pray you know only god can give them give them soulless and only god can give them peace you can't get peace from anywhere else we don't understand these things but you know i think one day god will put his arm around us and he'll go this is why i did that he'll say this is why i did that this is why this happened like that this is why i took the child when i took the child or took the husband or took the father i believe he's a god good enough god that he'll put his arm around you one day literally put his arm around you and say this is why i did that it was for their good i knew what they needed so we just pray for brother neal and him but let's go to the lord in prayer heavenly father thank you for the status you give us we truly pray that you would sanctify us for this journey lord and as you'll take care lord all things pertaining to life and happiness and all the things that we have here on earth lord we know you have your hand in it because we're your little bride and you said where two or three are gathered in your name that there you'll be in the midst father so we pray now that you're here close to us father that you'll you know there's things on our heart that we've been praying about lord now with brother neal and his grandson passing away lord only you know the situation and father we pray that you would minister to them lord minister to that family minister brother kenny capps we know him very well lord and his wife just be with them lord and take care of them father in this time of need lord there's many needs all over the country father many things that we see coming in brother dutch scott keeps us abreast of many people that are sick and and and things going on and around the message and not so much that but so much of physical that satan has started to attack us physically because he can't get once we're behind the word he can't get the word he can't get our soul our soul is sealed in plugged up and ready to go up but lord he has one thing he can play with and that's our flesh lord i pray today that you would though we be in this house of clay that you would take care of it lord and that you would clean us all out lord and forgive us of all of our sins and the many things that we do against you lord that we'll do a little checking up on our house to make sure that everything's okay lord make sure we read study and pray a little more than we used to lord lord because you deserve all the praise and honor and glory everything goes to you father you're the creator you're the one that's going to take this thing to the very end and we're going to sit down with you and live an eternity in a in a future home that's coming up lord that will be right here on this earth but father i pray that you'll take care of this flesh earth first lord that you'll sanctify it for the journey lord and clear out all the cobwebs and all the things lord that so easily beset us as paul said and run this race lord knowing that you're the author and finisher of our faith father be with us and take care of us lead us and guide us by your holy spirit today we ask in jesus name amen all right let's go to first john this is we're still continuing on two spirits part three and if we get to let there be we'll get to let there be if not we will pick it up wednesday night first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone into the world now remember though folks if these false prophets there has to be true prophets amen they're just not all false there has to be a truth amen and god's word is truth we know that hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god now remember we talked about this before that doesn't mean if you go outside and you ask a drunk if the drunk says yeah i believe jesus is the christ that doesn't mean he's saved right that word confesseth means like i said before logos it goes to the word all right if you'll look it up in the dictionary in the uh in the greek that jesus christ has come in the fleshes of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come into flesh it's not of god now you got to believe that he's come in your flesh amen it doesn't do me any good to know that he came 2 000 years ago unless i know that he's right here today amen because that's a historic god there's a lot of history i i i love this sermon that brother brown preached taking god out of history because many people they all he died on the cross therefore i'm saved well that don't mean nothing to you unless he's come inside your heart amen and we don't know that it's just hearsay i mean we're not our witnesses but we know that this word tells us everything that goes on right here this word is what we depend on all right and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist so there's two spirits right there's not eight or ten or fifth there's only two spirits when you come down to it there's the spirit of christ and there's a spirit of antichrist everything underneath that is a list of things are you know you take satan and you take god but then you got satan you got diseases and you got all these different things but it just comes from one spirit there's an unholy spirit and there's a holy spirit all right whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world now this is in john about 1896. so it's that's been a long time ago ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he thus in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us remember i said before our conversation our conversation when we were lost and out in the world the world of sin they understood our conversation they understood we were going to go get a beer they understood we were going to go get to this we were going to go get of that but when you walk in one day and say i don't do those things no more i've asked god to come into my heart and i don't have a desire to do that you know what they quit listening to you because they can't understand what you're saying how in the world well get a little bit of god and you'll know we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us and he is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error let's read ezekiel before we sit down second one moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou seedlest up to some full of wisdom and perfect in beauty wow who is this guy thou has been in eden the garden of god so it's not talking about a king a physical king tyrus amen talking about the devil because king tyrus wasn't in the garden of eden okay so it's talking it's an allegory talking of the devil thou hast been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was not covering the sardius the topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day that thou was created you may be seated in the lord that it's blessing to read in his word that was prepared and then the day that thou was created who created the devil who created lucifer god did god created lucifer but he created him with a position and an ability to make a choice i'll read you in here a few minutes well it'll be later on that that i was trying to find that quote where the prophet of god was telling us and i finally found it where all angels are put on free moral agency every person even god is a free moral agent remember he wants all to be saved but he only knows how many is going to be saved because of foreign knowledge right he's not just a a god that just says i want everybody to die if you don't fall down no he's a good god but you got to remember one thing he created satan he created lucifer let's get that right he was he created lucifer perfect until iniquity and we'll read it in a little while in isaiah till iniquity was found in his heart all right so we know that one thing's for sure that what we were talking about before that god i believe he created lucifer first why would he create something lesser because we'll read here in a minute where brother brown said that lucifer was god's right-hand man right-hand man so you don't create your right-hand man way down the line no he's he's going to be your helper you got him right here and that's the problem we have with the devil is we think the devil is this um um all red suit we look at him in halloween and he's got the horns and he's got the fangs and he's got the blood hanging out of his mouth and he's got this big long tail you know what we've always been we've been told that tale satan is not that way we're going to read it in just a little while where god said you're beautiful right here it says in ezekiel verse 12 it says perfect in beauty satan's the most beautiful angel most beautiful angel why because that can be the most deceiving how can you be deceiving how can you be the the epitome of deception look like we think satan looks like you know the boogeyman the old the you know the no no he's slick he knows how to work god made him perfect god made him beautiful but iniquity was found in his heart later on and we'll read that in just a minute but we're talking about two spirits because remember there's only two spirits now like i said before when we started i don't want us to get any person in mind i don't want us to get any denomination in mind because there's good people out in the denominations and and and we're not here to bash them but but there's a time when some when you if you turn the word down if you turn the pure adulterate unadulterated word down then god has to move on the denomination was good for a time but then god has to move on and when god moves on he leaves that because they can't go all the way with the word of god all right so but we know that god's used all the different ones to get to today that's why that i believe that that we are standing in the end time we're standing in the last there is no other word to come we've got everything we need uh when god sent us a prophet he didn't send us a halfway one he sent us a really good one he sent us one to give us what the words to tell us what the word says and actually go back into the mind of god and and not just for him to go into the mind of god but for you and i to go into that same mind because if you and i can't see this word because you know what it's the same thing as i said before if you can't realize and see the word of god like you see it in the message of the hour then brother brown's message is just hearsay i mean we do have some in here sister clito being one that literally saw the man and freedom was just a young girl probably didn't remember that much because she was a baby but some people did see him but some most of us did not so it's just a tale it's just something we heard it's just something but when but when god comes into your heart cleans out all that and puts the holy ghost in then if if this person had the holy ghost if if william branham had the baptism of the holy ghost and you get the baptism of the holy ghost you can't deny that because the holy ghost can't deny the holy ghost everybody got that because listen we're working with two spirits here one is the holy ghost and one is an unholy ghost or an unholy spirit and a holy spirit everybody got that say amen because watch now look in matthew 24 verse 23 the bible says then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ are there believe it not for there shall arise false devils no there shall arise false anointed ones false anointed christ and false anointed prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect you know we we look at a lot of these signs and wonders and we know that that we look at the great healing campaigns in the 40s 50s and in the early part of the 60s it that all these different people were a part of you know you got your schulers you got your um you just lump them all in there you got you know you got jack cole you've got um uh brother branham you've got uh all the different ones you oral roberts billy graham all these different ones came through that same era and they preached salvation as a message amen i mean they were god god spirit-filled men they weren't they weren't anti-word the antichrist was there sure but not in them but what happened is is during that time their healing campaign would kind of dwindle away but then you got the prophet of god coming on there in the 60s and bringing us a message bringing us the opening of the seals and the opening of of things that man had never had never dealt with before how in the world can we stand here today and and read these quotes and then read these scriptures and and that i can see how they dovetail and we can all see how they dovetail because when we when we look at acts 2 38 says repent and be baptized in the name of huh jesus christ we immediately know that's exactly what the bible says you say oh well well matthew 20 28 19 says baptize the name of the father that is the name of the father son holy god father's not a name son is not a name and holy ghost is not a name you're not going to sign your mother no you're not going to sign your check worker of whatever you're going to sign it by your name amen and i thought the bible says that all the family in heaven and earth are named jesus christ that's my identification i identify with my name that name tells me where i'm at and what i'm doing so actually what in acts 2 38 is the same scriptures matthew 28 19. same thing jesus told them going to all the world preach the gospel baptizing in the name not names because they're not names it's the name of the father what is the name of the father the lord what's the name of the son jesus what's the name of the holy ghost christ name of the lord jesus christ very simple once you see it okay let's go to the first quote now jesus was telling us that now be careful it's going to arise false christs and false prophets they shall grow show great signs and wonders let's look at number one in demonology the prophet of god tells us yeah there's false there's true and false of everything if i give you a dollar say is that a good dollar like i said before a good counterfeit dollar you can't tell the difference now satan doesn't make a counterfeit dollar that you can tell the difference he makes one that you can't tell the difference only what a trained eye only somebody with the holy ghost is going to know these two spirits that we're talking about because as jesus said if if somebody comes and says oh christ is over here well if you've got him inside of you why do you want to go over there or if you do go over there you'll know where he's at he's inside of you all right so now look i'm sorry excuse me and if jesus said the two spirits down here at the bottom and the last day would be so close till it would deceive the very lack that's what i just read you there in matthew religious people right now remember now there ain't nothing out there in them old cold formal outside they have just a form of godliness you see but these two spirits are real spirits it'd be so closely deceived the very elect how it was working side by side in the last days did jesus say that sure he did number two the god of this evil age 1965 the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil spirit working in deception not working in the bar joints and working in the beer in the in the beer you know factories and uh uh no working in the church the people of the earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age showing that it is christ if the finger is supposed to move in this age then the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eyes to see in this age the eye will see the spirit of god as it's grown into the full stature of god there's the key we're not to be babies anymore paul told us to go on you know drink milk that's okay you know have your have your uh baby food for a time but when you grow up you don't have baby food no more amen you grow up and eat strong meat and that's what the age is now is the age that we're now living in the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called out of this chaos now my would you not like to be called out of this chaos look the devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by error as usual by perversion of the word of god he doesn't walk up to you and say no the word of god is not right no that's not deception the deception is is to be one word off that's when we get to the garden of eden and we see those two spirits working in the garden of eden we see which one that eve took hold of and it was only one word god said if you eat this tree you shall die satan said you shall not die and she took that one word and that's why we're wearing a mouse today amen by perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning see it coming back to that seed time again from eden here it is again because remember the book of genesis is your seed chapter everything started in that book of genesis all right so remember as that started in the book of genesis god has shown the plan of redemption and then in the book of revelation it shows the end of that beginning so satan had a beginning satan's going to have an end if you're born of a spirit of god today you've never had a beginning and you never will have an end amen all right so let's do read number three see does not air with the show remember there was no more seed promised to a woman anywhere after mary and there is no more denomination promised after pentecost it's the rapture and the bride coming forth from there the seed the word made manifest again i want everybody if you've got a pencil a piece of paper to write this down on the top of your nose the spoken word is the original seed that wasn't just a message that brother brown preached that is so profound and i saw something just a couple days ago that blew my mind remember he is the only one that has seed i ain't talking about male seed i ain't talking about seed of a flower when you talk about god almighty he only has one kind of seed and that's the spoken word of god he believed his own word amen do you know a tree came from the spoken word of god you know grass came from the spoken word of god the seed didn't that was the seed i'll read it to you in a minute there's the old adage you know uh liv did the chicken come first or the egg well if you believe in creation the chicken came first because god created a chicken then out of that chicken came an egg but what created the chicken the seed word of god because we'll see here that the god creates them and then he tells them that every seed brings forth of their kind okay same way with adam and eve oh yeah where'd he come from spoken word spoken word god didn't come down and plant a bunch of seeds no i believe he's spoken into existence and then he told it to multiply all right everybody got that say amen so now look watch notice see how close it looks matthew said matthew 24 24 we read the two spirits in the last day the church spirit now look the church spirit of the church people not the prostitute you know out in the world no it's church church people and the bride spirit of the bride people would be so close together until it would deceive the very elective or possible that's how close now this is where i want to base everything on here number four i'm gonna read some of these quotes and then we'll then we'll get back to the beginning because remember we we were speaking last last week on before the beginning how can we go back before the beginning we've only got the bible that says god created the heaven and earth but we go back into the mind of god where the prophet of god makes it so real how that this person called god almighty would stand out in out in nothingness and create a world from what the spoken word read it the spoken word is the original seed a this world you're standing on came from the seed word of god speaking everybody got that say amen so now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and discrediting of god's word because that's what satan does satan can't deny god's word he just wants to discredit it he can't deny because remember if we got god standing here and we got lucifer standing here the son of the morning the anointed cherub the angel that he created saying right here god's right-hand man he heard everything that was said but the problem was his problem was he couldn't speak it i believe that's what made him mad god's out here having all this fun making the stars and the moon and making solar systems beyond solar systems and solar systems beyond solar systems and the devil's going can i no be quiet can i no hush because he couldn't create he wasn't he wasn't a creator god is the only creator so he's the only one that has a seed to create with satan doesn't have that's why he's so powerless if we'll look at it in that form that satan is a created being but if you and i are born again today of the spirit of god you didn't have a beginning that inside person that when you said god saved my soul and he came down and he cleaned out that old nature and he put himself inside there satan can't touch that and he even made you a little creator when he did that amen so satan is a hate and that's why satan hates it he hates that god's inside of a human being he hates when god works through people in what not out there in here in the religious realm but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast in the lake of fire because remember after all this after even a excuse me after all even a thousand years the bible tells us that for a thousand years that satan is bound right look can't be he's not loose because he can't work in the people he's not bound by chains he's bound by he has nobody to work to the bible tells us the bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you you've bound him right there oh but no that devil he's such a i thought i read you last sunday where the bible or last week where the bible says that we'll look at him one day and say is that the man right yeah that took down nations and he'll be like an old sock drunk laying in a landing in a uh in a ditch and that's but remember though the guy's a fighter he's gonna fight him we bind him for a thousand years and after that thousand years he still thinks he's got a chance which we know he does not so that'll make you happy because we have the devil's answer the answer is this word of god that gives us power over the devil amen he knows he can't stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now invincible armies never lose invincible armies never lose if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church right here today our false ideas and our things contrary to the word of god if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert satan hates revelation but we love it and with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now let's go to number five exposition those church ages this is jude chapter 3 4 and then it also has 12 but let's read this right here beloved when i gave all give gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men this is the next scripture for there are certain men not saints crept in unawares those have not come into the fold by means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before of old ordained remember what brother louise was preaching on for ordination or for knowledge god knew that they would be reprobates he knew they would take the word of god and turn it into lasciviousness he knew all those things but he allowed them to come on this earth what to try me in you because they're going to feast with us i'll read it right here who were before of old ordained to this condemnation now listen not that god chose them to be ungodly listen god didn't even choose lucifer to be ungodly he gave lucy for a choice god cannot create the the devil the devil did that make sense he created lucifer and we're going to see in just a few minutes that lucifer means light bearer he didn't make him a dark creature like we think is you know well there's the opposition no he became the opposition by turning down the word of god he turned down his position and wanted to get what higher than god he couldn't help himself ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ these are spots in your feast of charity when they feast with you not feeding out there somewhere feeding with you feeding themselves without fear wow it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined remember jesus told him he said look remember they were talking about this certain group in a certain group he said look leave him alone he said let the wheat and the tares grow up together because when you got like i was telling you in my garden you got corn and grass looks just alike until it gets up to about this high right so you don't want to go out there and just whack it all down and say i'll get all these all this grass up and then you've cut down all your crop you wait till it matures and then jesus said wait just a little while and let the tares grow up in the wheat gr wheat grow up and then you'll be able to tell what by their fruits you'll be known and you'll be able to what separate the wheat from the tares the tares are to be burned we know that and the wheat is to be taken into the rapture amen but right now they are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds look at number six consummation of the gentile age we there yeah okay this age is the last of the seven church ages what began in the first of the ephesians must and will come to full fruition and harvest and the last will lay out a c and age the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sowing the watering the growing is all over summer's ended the sickle is now thrust into the harvest harvest time yes and actually this is now harvest time coming up uh sister milker reminded me this morning that this is barley season in over in in israel september october barley season okay anyway the two spirits will terminate their manifestation harvest time yes harvest time the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated the fruit of those vines which were at such variants will be gathered into separate gardeners the two spirits will go to their separate destinations all right everybody got that they'll go to their separate destinations but now remember they had to have a starting place and that's what we were talking about last week they had to have a starting place those two spirits well remember we know that there was an act that happened in the garden of eden to throw us into sin but remember sin did not start on earth sin started in heaven that's why heaven and earth the pastor have to pass away remember the bible says oh lucifer thou have fallen all right thou have fallen down now that's been in the eden the garden of god wow that was perfect in my ways i'm reading in ezekiel but i'm kind of paraphrasing that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created until iniquity was found in thee let's pull that up there if you don't mind look at verse 17 thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty not because of thy ugliness that heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy darkness nope that's not what that said because of thy brightness listen the devil don't want to be darker than god he wants to be brighter than god he wants you to notice him and not notice god because god came down in human flesh as a common man no beauty that we should desire him i'm reading scripture if you don't mind but what here and then here we reverse it and think well the devil's this you know this nasty no he is the most beautiful of angels he is the most anointed of angels god's right-hand man he was that heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy kingdom wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic it keeps going on so let's go to number eight and read the seal of god i'm doing a lot of reading today but i want you to to get we're going to get down to something here in just a minute i want i've already read these the other day so you're all you ought to have known that the seal of the antichrist 1955 if you'll notice just about the time that jesus came on the scene judas came on the scene you got to remember say here here we go to the very beginning then god comes on the scene he creates the first guy he creates is lucifer amen that's his right hand guy then you come down and you you look down and you you he's they're thrown down the earth and you got cain and abel then you we're going to keep on going through the bible you've got dathan cora and moses you've always got god bringing somebody on the scene then you've got elijah comes on the scene and there's ahab or then you've got elijah come on the scene and there's balaam you've always got oppositions so here when jesus comes on the scene judas comes on the scene now he is the epitome of deception judas is the epitome of deception he talked with god he walked with god he prayed he preached he cast out devils he sat beside of god we believe jesus is god you know that amen not a second person he was god if he what if he wasn't god he was a deceiver because he said if you've seen me you've seen the father amen so look i want you to notice the nature of these two spirits now judas was a religious man remember judas even to the very moment brother john the very moment jesus speaks in the upper room now he's going to die the next day he knows that but they don't know that right right he says whoever is sopping in the bowl with me listen what he's saying he failed to just listen to what the word said whoever stops in this bowl with me is the one that's going to deceive me it wasn't a roman centurion it wasn't it wasn't even caiaphas so we be very religious though he was the head of the religious organization of the day right they were out there but judas was right here and even when judas said is it me the lord turns and says go do what you got to do all the 11 was like well judas is just going to go pay the bills you know he was the money he was the bag holder you know he held the money he's going to just go pay for this meal that was last this supper that we ate how deceiving was that right there and i believe that really until they got into that upper room they really didn't understand what really happened to judas because remember judas right after that went and hung himself okay and then they probably found out about that and then when they up went to the upper room they found another matthias and put him in place of judas but then they really understood that they said man this guy was right here among us the greatest deceiver was right here sitting with us he was not 12 plus one abby he was not 12 disciples plus judas out here on the outside no judas was chosen by jesus to walk with the disciples one of the 12. you see what i'm saying here so close that it could deceive the very leg the two spirits now watch and i want you to notice the natures of these spirits now judas was a religious man he was not an infidel and all of us know that he was the antichrist he worked the very closest hand to christ his right-hand man did you know that in heaven that the devil was god's right-hand man in the beginning that lucifer the son of the morning now remember we call him the son of the darkness we call him the demon of darkness he's called the son of the morning that's daylight that's when it first comes up and it gets bright did you know that in heaven that the devil was god's right-hand man in the beginning that lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that god had created and perverted it back into an evil thing which started all this trouble in the beginning satan is not an originator because that'd make him a creator but he takes what god creates that's why he's so deceiving he's standing right there beside of god you say satan can yeah it's kind of hard to believe brother donny that that the devil can talk to god any time as evil as he is and we try to talk to god and sometimes you know where you at lord amen you say how it proved that well didn't go to the book of job god said uh hey satan where you been he said i've been up and down you know up and down walking up and down in the world you know and looking around looking around he said hey if you consider my servant job they're talking to each other listen satan is not this he is the most hideous thing in the world but god allows him to be right there because he created him perfect he created him to do a job but now he didn't create him to make him do a job that would make god not a just god if he created satan for the sole purpose of him to be evil no he created him perfect just like i told y'all before adolf hitler's spirit come from god his soul god said all souls are mine it's hard to believe that but it's not hard to believe if you'll understand god is the only life-giver that's right satan can't give you life he has no seed to base it from that's where adam and eve came from they came from the seed word of god that's right then that little baby that was formed in a womb came from the seed word of god his name was jesus christ the savior of the world the lucifer the son of the morning started all the trouble in the beginning then god back before the foundation of the world was ever laid when he seen what satan done see he knew what satan was going to do when he came here but he couldn't make him any other way and be a just god that's what i've said before every person then everybody it doesn't matter if it's an angel they were created with a choice i'll read it to you in just a few minutes how are you and i the bible says you and i are going to judge angels judge angels well they're just holy no satan preached listen michael and satan michael and lucifer didn't get up there and have a wwe um world wrestling federation uh knocked down dragout and one of them tap out no what is the war today it's not with flesh and blood and fighting it's what spirits is preaching satan preached his sermon to a third or two-thirds of the angels and they took his lie and then god cast them out of heaven is that all right so let's read this right here just keep on reading this right here and his pride went over in the north and set up a kingdom and fought against michael and his angels the right-hand man of almighty god was lucifer the son of the morning the first god granted him almost co-workers with him he was a co-worker partly equal with him only satan could not create so satan has no seed he has no origin he can't something cannot originate from him that's why he has to take and pervert amen all the all the things we do in life satan can pervert it and just twist it just a little way and it it becomes perverted because what is adultery we as human beings we're supposed to procreate but we're supposed to do it the right way we're supposed to marry amen right that's what god set up now if we do it right then we're okay but what does satan do he takes that and makes adultery out of it and turns it in the right act turned wrong preaching of the gospel everything's got a right and the wrong but satan took something look god is the only creator but satan took something that god created and perverted it back into something else evil amen in the garden of eden god created adam and eve perfect and full of god gonna get a little tit a little touchy here like brother dale said this morning they weren't sinners sin had not entered the picture yet now it was in heaven and it cast you know it ca he got cast down into the earth but he didn't create adam a center he created adam from the spoken word of god and then put that word inside of him same thing with eve so satan's watching it he's going hmm okay i got an idea i got an idea but i got to fight here i got to get me some subjects first so let's go to revelation 12 verse 7. and there was war in heaven one war in the garden of eden it was war in heaven i'm reading the bible revelations 12. there was war in heaven michael and his angels see the problem with satan is he didn't know that michael was god michael's christ not a different person i done told you satan thinks he's pretty fast but he's only second fast amen he's only second rate god can be right here today and appear to me and you today now we know not in body form we know that but he can appear and give you the holy ghost and be in china in less than a split second and give the holy ghost to the same person so now tell me he's not pretty quick so there stands god and he's talking and he's talking to satan and all of a sudden here comes a form comes out if michael was christ and we know the christ was the logos amen jesus christ but he sees that and he goes uh wait a minute i told you that's how satan got the father-son holy ghost baptism idea i mean the father-son holy ghost trinitarian idea he sees god standing here and he sees another form go out and then he then he remembers in his mind that god said let us create man in our own image and let's make them a god genesis 1 26 and there goes adam out of the logos and here's adam and here's michael and god's still standing there and satan's going hmm i think i can make three out of them and i'm going to feed it to them because i know there's just one the bible tells us that the devil believes in one god and trembles but he tells us down here that we got a father-son holy ghost we got three different persons or some kind of three-headed monster no listen like brother dale said this morning the bible tells us that the godhead can be easily understood by the things we see what do we see we see that as he said before but i'm going to use dad because dad wasn't dad when he was born dad was a child right right but then dad and mom gets together and has the perfect one first but now look it makes him it makes him he can't say anything he's in church it makes him father though you got that now it's the same guy right that's right same personality same samuel wade dalla was born april the 16th in 1940 but he grew up and took a position of father when he had me now did he change his personality no probably made him a little more aggravated when the other two came along but it made him a father amen now remember though when he was born he became the son of sam dale right he became the son of sam and i'm looking at the same guy he became the son of samuel of sam dale then he became the father of samuel wade dale ii that is my name then he became the father of the mother too but now has he changed persons but now remember he's a human with limited ability because god's not right right god's not a one uh with limited ability he's all-knowing all he's there he's omnipotent he's on the present he knew how many kids he was going to have dad didn't right right right but god being god knew how many children he was going to have so that made him a father he was going to be a father right but he came down and become the son to die on the earth for me and you the son of man amen i like that like brother dale said brother brown said the only way god could be a father was to be a son first be a sad to be a son he didn't send a son i wouldn't send josh to die for me what kind of father would that be but then he's the same man later on in life became a grandfather and a pastor and you just keep naming titles but you only got one guy you take that same thing with god almighty and human flesh he was god almighty and he went and stepped into human flesh by creating a seed that came from where not from the earth because see my natural seed this is what i wanted to get into if i don't get anything else we may stop right here my natural seed came from this earth right that's right from him you you understand what i'm saying the natural seed of me came from him right that's the way it was for ordained back in what happened in the garden and we'll get into that later on right so my literal what you see right here come from this earth but now remember that's not the spoken word seed of god that's permitted of god to get you here so that you can make a choice whether to receive the seed word of god or the seed of discrepancy or the seed of the devil i shouldn't be getting close to y'all i'll stand back up here i'll put my mask on if i walk down there again tony's looking at me going just lean over a little bit but here we are and we see that god as he's standing there in the beginning if you can't see it i'm going to try to illustrate about as good as i can we know one thing's for sure god's not an old man as the as the pictures portray him as you know i i was telling you before when june went to the bab had her jaunt with the baptist church for the second time she come home with this book and she was so excited bless her heart remember women can be deceived a lot more than men just remember that but she brings this she hey man she brings this book home nice glasses she brings she brings this book home and she says we're studying this don't don't touch me we're studying this and i looked on there and she'll verify it it said experiencing god and it was a book about this big and it had all the little sweet little things somebody from a college somewhere out west or something wrote in the in the book jim tell them what the picture was it looked like rip van winkle ball-headed long hair stick in his hand like this experiencing god i told her i said that's not my god that may be the devil's god that he wants you to see but the god i see like brother brown said i can you see that he said a kid a child playing before the father's door and you know what most children you give them a bunch of toys man they go to town well what about if you give this being unlimited power we're going to get into that let there be light in just a little while if we get to it because that little kid that little 20 year old god that never was old god's not one second as old now as he was when he said let there be life not one second if not he's not god so he's always been 20 years old he said how do you know that well brother dale's talking about this morning when that man that looked 50 he wasn't 50. he looked 50. bible says you look 50. you know he said before abraham was i am he said you look you look 50 years old oh you're no he was only 30 some odd years old right but he looked very old because of his his time on earth but now remember mary magdalene knew that guy right mary magdalene for three and a half years of jesus's ministry she followed him looking at that guy okay that's the picture of the guy she had in her mind everybody got that say amen all right but now remember when he raised from the dead and stepped out of the tomb he couldn't have looked like that that was his earthly time that was his earthly journey he was a young boy because when mary magdalene she turned around and she said what have you done with my lord i thought he was the gardener when you said talk about this morning the two that went to emmaus they had walked with jesus for that same three and a half years they knew him as that person right there but when he stepped out of the bushes and walked down through there he was in another form what he was in the form i believe he was back into the form besides the nail scars for me and you he was back in the form where he said let there be when he stepped out of that tomb he said all power and heaven and earth has been given unto me he went all the way back to eternity and he said hey i'm the same guy but guess what thomas this was for you i didn't have these nail scarves when i was back in eternity didn't need them he said but i had to do this because of you and he said i'll keep these he said i'll be happy to live in this body i'll be happy to live in this body but it doesn't look like that so here's god standing in eternity and he's standing there and he's 20 years old and he's going milky way son earth right here i don't want you to go any further because i need some people to live on this one you don't think that way i do when i read that genesis account i think man he's like fish in the water got some water here he said it's not really it's not really that cold or not really that one let's make some kind of fish that'll go in that warm water because there's some fish to go in warm water and some won't go in warm water what a variety that god is but what the problem is though is you got somebody following him so that's how you did that because remember in satan's mind he's working on his own he's working on his own kingdom he sees god setting up his kingdom and just going let there be let there be let there be and there was he could stand there for an eternity and go let there be and he'd get nothing but satan remember the perversion that satan had was is he said i'm going to take everything that he's doing and i'm going to twist it just a little bit and i'm going to have them people worship me because my kingdom's going to look prettier cain my sacrifice is going to look much better nimrod my city is going to be the biggest city huh right but we got to get out of the car in the meeting first but look but there was war in heaven let's pull back up revelation 12. i kind of get off a little bit there there was war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels so there was a separation in heaven and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan so we know who that was and i have a quote i didn't bring it but brother brown said satan they believed satan's sermon so michael like i said michael michael and lucifer wasn't up here doing this no i believe god showed him his plan and i believe satan showed him his plan and satan took part of them with him because of their choice and god had part of the ones that chose him i just how else are you going to say it to watch and he was cast out into the earth and the angels were cast out with him so where is the devil the devil's not in hell that's where he's going he's here he came from what another dimension into this dimension to do what to try to destroy god's creation amen he went into god's eden and destroyed it now we'll watch later on how that god's going to come into satan's eden and he's going to take out a bride and satan is going to hate it that's why i said satan hates revelation he hates us to know where we come from what we're doing here and where we're going all right and the great dragon was cast out in verse 10 and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night how many times have i told you that god tells us that if he will if we will ask him to forgive us of our sins that he will place it in the sea of god's forgiveness according to the old testament never to be remembered again god's the only one that can do that he's the only one can erase his memory right because the devil's going to go don't you remember he did god's going what sins are you talking about i love that song what sins are you talking about the devil is the accuser of the brethren he accuses us day and night i don't know if he does that to you but he sure does it to me he reminds me of all the things that i did all the wrongs that i did and you know what listen don't go to god and ask forgiveness for the same sin over and over again unless you unless you don't think that you really got forgiveness but if you get forgiveness that sin god's just you know the lord's gonna look at you and go what's saying you're talking about because i thought he was coming back after a sinless perfect white robed bride of jesus christ now let us go to heaven and get it when you get the baptism from the holy ghost you get your white robe here you carry it there with you oh that ought to make you feel good how did all that even god's standing there and all this chaos going on with the devil and he's going that's all right that's okay i got my people you know where i had them i had them satan where you couldn't find them i had them right here i had them right here and this is where i keep them that great album that god took a picture of you like i said before if god's a 20 year old god guess what you and i are going to be when we get to glory when we get when we take a body change we're going to change right back just like jesus did we're not going to change back why would donnie want to strive all his whole life being 70 one years old why we do want to strive to be a good christian and even if something does happen he passes away that he's going to raise back up like that me too brother all of us no we don't have a hope we have an assurity that if we do have to go into another dimension and we have to sleep we don't die if we have to sleep that that 20 year old body that god had before the foundation of the world put up in his mind that's why you and i have to come we have to come natural seed first because of what happened in the fall we'll get to that a little bit later on because of what happened in the fall we got to come this way because we'll read it in a minute where jesus or you say jesus or the creator the creator said let every seed bring forth of its kind now remember satan was standing there and he was going hmm now he said that let's see if we can make it come to pass because i don't have a seed for myself right satan don't have a seed he's not a person as far as that is he's not a human being he's a spiritual being right so he can't procreate he can't and jesus never procreated either you know we got to get that we came on this side of the of the of the act remember the spoken word is the original seed not from the loins of man not from not from an act it comes from this act he stood there and said let there be and there it was right all right so let's get let's go through this a little bit more here we go and heard a loud voice saying in heaven now it's come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accused of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil it's come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou are falling from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning what does lucifer mean i showed you here in the greek lexicon lucifer means the light bearer shining one morning star you know jesus called the morning star satan wants to be called just like him he don't want to be he cr sure he everything around him is darkness but remember he had a light so let's look at this just a second how art thou fallen from heaven a loose for son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which does weaken the nation which did us for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend see he got cast out so he's got to go try to get back up brother john he's trying to get back up that way trying to get back into heaven i will ascend ascend is up i will ascend into heaven and i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mountain of the congregation in the sides of the north ah that's in the congregation around here all of us i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be light the most high now remember there's a position he wants to be like god but if you read over in the book of revelations here we'll get it maybe wednesday night he wants to be god it won't be like god he wants to be god right and you and i are not like god if you're born again today you are god made manifest in another form what one of those other attributes that satan can't understand because here stands the creator and there went adam and eve and then on the day of pentecost there was 120 little jesus is created right satan can't understand that you know why because he can't multiply like that he perverts what god has yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee right here this is it they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth the tremble yeah that did shake kingdoms this guy that's powerless unless you give him the power oh no he no he anoints you satan anoints you just like god anoints you and sometimes you can't tell the difference right wow wow all right let's read number nine here real quick and then we'll we'll we're not going to get to let there be light i wish we could but we'll get to it wednesday night number nine that dead calvin sin did not start on the earth sin started in heaven lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth now remember it started in heaven he was cast out to earth and now remember there's a there's an idea in the denominational world that says that those spirits came down and you know became human beings they can't do that okay does everybody understand that they cannot you can be full of the devil but it's because you let him in right all right but he can't just take that's what i'm saying about you look at god and you and you see how god set this whole thing up that satan can influence you all he wants to but as long as god's in your soul he can't get you he can't have you he can't put his greasy hands now he can beat this thing up but he can't have that eternal person that's inside that's why the new birth is so important not just a feeling not just any motion not just i go to church every sunday but a real true revelation of what god's done for you in your soul and being that god is in your soul he's not going to deny the word never will he deny the word the word can't deny the word satan can sin began in heaven where god put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings on so some people somebody asked me one time a long time ago said how in the world did angels fall they were holy created beings well now they didn't the bible never said they were holy beings the bible said some of them sang holy holy holy unto the lord but he put them on the same and see that makes god continuity that makes where that you read these scriptures especially down here a little bit further we're finished with that one let's go to jude 1 verse 6 says and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved an everlasting change under darkness and to the judgment judgment of the great day everybody is going to be judged angels satan's already judged because he got cast out but who's going to judge him ah first corinthians let's let's skip that we'll read we'll read number ten first corinthians 6 3 do you not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matter know you not that you shall judge angels why would they need judging they're free moral agents just like me and you how much more things that pertain to this life amen now let's go back if you don't mind let's go back and read quote number 10 then we'll close musicians get ready to come we'll we'll talk about the light because remember this is what i'm heading toward remember luis was talking about this the other night and i knew there was an answer to this because god told them god told them god in the beginning he said let there be light that was not the sun and the moon they were created on the fourth day this was the first day what is that like i'll tell you when i tell you wednesday night we'll do some paul harvey the rest of the story but it's real interesting though how that that's weaved into the creation and how that the prophet of god makes one quote and it clears the whole thing up because you think well the sun needs to be here and the moon needs to be here and now remember because on the third day plants started growing they need photosynthesis they need some kind of sunlight ah we'll see in just a little while wednesday night about 7 20 or 7 30. same bat channel same bat station right louise whatever that meant greatest battle ever fought do this and we'll be we'll be done now i believe the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in the action into action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers i believe he's been dressing them training them and the battle front is now set getting ready to start this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings it didn't fall in them you say somebody's devil possessed you have to be careful with that now somebody can be completely um motivated but if that soul still there remember there's always a chance of salvation it doesn't matter how hideous adolf hitler could have been saved if he wanted to be remember the bible says only blaspheming the holy ghost there is no cure for that there is no there's no redemption for that everybody got that anything else you think of the worst murder you want to think of that soul is still before he dies it is able to be saved by god amen believe that if you want to i believe it everybody has a chance until that last breath comes except for one thing and that's blasphemed in the holy ghost look and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles because remember we're not fighting flesh and blood that's scripture but principalities and powers in high places we're not fighting as i said before let's not put somebody's name in this that you may know of that has turned against the word or turned against the message no it's that spirit that we're talking about we look at the characteristics of that other spirit and it can get on you folks have you not ever had a spirit get on you yeah it'll get on you but if you're a born-again child of god he can't touch your soul and i'll promise you one thing's for sure i don't care what battle you go through if you're a son and daughter of god as i said before god the bible tells us the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord and until your time is up and if you're a child of god and god looks at you and says that's as far as i need you to go you ought to be pleased with that but he you will not go before then don't let the devil stand here and tell you yeah see i've had little things going on for the past couple weeks still got a little bit going on now but you know that little thing sits right here and goes you're gonna die and i told it something the other day and it left me alone for a little while you know what the bible says that the devil in the temptation of jesus what happened he was right there but remember the bible says satan left him for a season he didn't leave him forever he left even the almighty god in human flesh he was what sitting there buffing him but you know what if something ever comes in your mind and says you're dying i'm gonna kill you i'm gonna take your life no one thing's for sure that's not god your heavenly father your savior your redeemer would never come to you and say i'm gonna kill you he'll never come to you and so you all you do is say liar amen liar until my daddy's finished with me oh yeah we may go through problems but what is it for i thought the bible said it was for our perfection for our perfection so who wants to come to perfection we all do and satan came to destroy god's creation musicians come on what god had created to be for himself he had satan came to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and beginning us and has been raging ever since let's stand to our feet been raging ever since we look at what happened in the garden of eden that wasn't the first sin that was the first sin down here on earth right amen so god couldn't god god couldn't make the devil do these things but he created him perfect he created him beautiful knew what he was going to do but you know what i believe he looked at when he created lucifer i believe he looked at him he said look buddy you're my right-hand guy if you'll stay in your position and do what you're supposed to do and not exalt yourself above me i'm going to put you in a position that no one else is going to have but you but remember the devil couldn't stand that god knew it before he created him so you know what he had he already had the lamb slain before the foundation of the world up here in his mind he already had me and you preserved and every christian from the dawn of time till today he had us preserved right here i don't believe brother john i don't believe god didn't tell satan the whole story he told him what he needed you're my worship angel you're my anointed guy you're my right hand guy you can't create let me do the creating because remember when god's first son came on earth because remember the bible says adam was the first was the son of god amen what do you tell adam basically you take care of the earth i'll take care of heaven see satan couldn't do that so it couldn't be submissive because i believe adam was submissive i believe adam said oh i know you're my creator i know that i came from you see but satan didn't do that satan said i know i came from you but i'm a whole lot better than you are you see what the difference is watch the difference real quick before we close what's the difference i want you to chew on this to wednesday night what's the difference in these two scenarios here's moses here's moses moses is standing here he's got all these millions of people you've got all these problems and yada yada and here comes jethro which is his father-in-law right jethro walks up and says now moses it's just too much for one man to do why don't you get somebody to help you out here now listen god honored that by what took the spirit off of moses and put it on 70 different people to take care of the situation now what jethro do jethro said now moses you're taking too much on yourself right now out into the wilderness we come here comes nathan and cora the first thing they do they walk up and says moses you take too much on yourself same thing but look at the outcome god knew jethro's heart he was trying to help moses nathan and carl was trying to set up something that moses didn't need because they were going out here and they were talking amongst their they brought like 250. i've been reading it in the bible they brought like 250 of the best men the devil always gets the best men 250 of the best men and they go moses you ain't the only man in the camp you see the difference though in the two scenarios it was almost exactly the same it was the approach your approach to god means all in the world everything in the world comes from that approach jethro approached him and said moses you're about to die up here you got you you're having a nervous breakdown because you got two million people trying to tell you what to do and get you some people let them help you we'll see nathan corbin the same way but dave and the court had in their heart that they were going to be say satan the same thing satan can't he can't get away from that cycle he wants to be just something better than what god's put on the earth that's right same thing with us he wants to be just a little bit better well god bless you love you with the love of the lord two spirits there's only two and if satan or if i'm sorry let's go back to lucifer if lucifer because that was his first name lucifer would have was created perfect if he would have stayed in his position he'd have been all right but god knew he could not stay in his position so therefore he couldn't just he couldn't stop him he let him be a free moral agent same way with the angels he said all right here's what we're going to do what did what hap what happened in the moses in nathan and chorus scenario god steps down he says um if you're with moses you need to get over here basically it's what he said moses said if you're with me get over here because what's going to happen to them nathan cora and their whole family the bible says they walked out from their tent he called them out moses called them out of their tent and rebuked them and told them said today you've made a choice and there's something will happen that's never happened before and the earth literally opened up and not just nathan and korra their whole family tent house and all went into the ground and shut up and as soon as it did god took fire off the sensor and killed them 250 people that were renowned men men that were of you know some kind of stature because what they rebelled against god there's your two spirits but they were so close they made us see the very late let's sing a song god bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music] because he lives all fear is gone because i know us i know he holds [Music] [Music] you know god's only one can give life satan can't give life god's the only life giver there is and what you do with it is your choice but because somebody died on a cross god almighty in human flesh he wasn't going to trust the son to come down he wasn't going to trust another person no he came himself he said i'm going to take care of this mess i'm not going to send him i i've already had a right hand guy and he kind of messed up no i'm not going to send the right-hand guy i'm coming myself because i'm the only one that can stand on earth and say destroy this body and i'll raise it back up you can't say that i can't say that nobody can say that but god almighty he said you touch this body i'll raise it back up and not only raise it back up brother john i'm going to come back on the day of pentecost and i'm going to divide myself out satan's going it'll make you really weak buddy you're going to get really really weak you know if you you keep dividing yourself up like this you know god's like nah you just wait satan you think i'm pretty rough i got 120 just like me down there on earth now and i've got three thousand down there just like me now and i've got a bride in the end time that's just like me down there and we were put on this earth for a purpose is to destroy the effects of the devil now look we can't destroy the devil he gets destroyed in the lake of fire but we can destroy the effects of the devil that he has on me and you amen that's what we can destroy because he has no power thank you lord except what power we give it so go with god let's sing this one more time [Music] and life is worth the living just because he lives sing it to him right now oh because he lives i can face tomorrow think about that because he lives all fear is gone [Music] because i know he holds my future and life is worth the living just because he lives live for god that's all we got folks live for god amen let's do our best even at our best we might fail but as i said before let's get our house and make sure it's all swept and garnished yes oh no that was back in sanctification i thought paul said i'd die daily there's a daily sweeping out of your house this house a daily sweeping out sometimes we have things that heap upon us and i promise you one thing for sure if you'll do what god said if you'll do what god said if you have a fault with your brother go to him if there's anything you know it i don't have to know it brother dale don't have to know it you know it i know the things i do because i live with me i don't know brother ryan i don't sit in a chicken truck with you every day but god does and there's a there's a holy spirit that's there sure we know what's inside of us if i was thinking about this and i want to continue a little bit further on there's an anointing brother dale's talking about different ones everybody's talking about there's an anointing what you do with it that's why when we pray now right when we pray song leaders when you come back and you pray when i pray with you i say god let this brother use that anointing that he is anointed with see he's not anointed to preach in that situation he's anointed to come out here and bring that anointing of worship to you to what to clear back the fog to clear back the fog i read a quote yesterday where brother brown said he said when sin happened in the garden he said there was a fog came on the earth you remember there was a holy ghost veil over adam and eve they were naked didn't know didn't know anything about that and all of a sudden what happened there in the garden of eden brother brown said there was a fog and even a fog came over adam's mind [Music] a fog why because the holy ghost had lifted off the earth because remember that holy ghost didn't appear back on the earth in human beings until jesus came back on earth amen then now we got that here but there's still that fog and i believe that fog is lifting i believe we're going to come to a place listen god is going to have preeminence he will not take second best he created you to be who you are but you got to make a choice i challenge you to read your bible just a little bit more than you did before listen to one more tape than you listened to before listen to one more sermon to brother dale that you didn't listen to before i challenge you to do that and say god i need an answer we all have questions god i need an answer on this right here how many times have you asked him and the preacher walk out here or you turn a tape on and you need an answer from god and there's william branham from 60 years ago he says oh i see in a congregation you brother you're struggling with this problem and it's you and you're not sitting there but god knows it god knew it before the foundation of the world how many times have you been listening to tate and brother brown say all of you that have a problem he's he said if you need prayers to raise your hand and as soon as mine went up the other day he said god bless you brother i mean it was it was just like he knew it was me i just went like this god bless you there brother you see what i mean listen the spirit of god has not left this earth the spirit of prophecy has not left this earth the spirit of the of healing has not left this earth god takes his man but he never takes his spirit that same spirit is for me and you to take hold of read your bible pray and study more than you've ever done before because we need it because you know what satan is not out there sometimes you can smell his stinking breath i don't know about you he said oh the devil don't get that close to me well pray for me because sometimes you can smell his breath come right over the side of you and say hey i'll get you you're done for i'll take you out of this world and then you you just look over and say okay [Music] but my daddy over here he holds everything in his hand [Music] you don't you hold nothing you have no power please use that sometime and watch him he'll move away he'll give you some peace not satan but god will give you some peace when satan moves away because i know he bombards us every day of our life you know why i'm gonna give you a secret you know why because he feels that same anointing that he felt on jesus when he was combating him in the desert and combating him on the earth he feels that same spirit brother ryan because we're not down here as babies anymore we're right up here waiting for that headstone which was jesus christ himself so satan feels that brother louise and he's not running from us though he's so bold he's right there in our face but he cannot win there's nowhere in the bible satan wins anything so if we believe the word of god take that with you use that against him this thing's a sword it's a lightsaber better than any lightsaber that anybody else could make hey man harrison this doesn't have anything to do with lightsaber and star wars no this thing right here will cut you and do surgery and take out that meanness take out that whatever you want to call it he'll take that right out and never leave a scar that's how fast that thing is bro john god i got this problem and you go that didn't even hurt that's what that two-edged sword will do that word oh boy when it cuts though but when he takes that thing out see that's what we all need to be working on is god take this sword because it's the little things the little foxes that spoil the vine you shouldn't be having listen if you're not born again you've got big problems but if you're born again you've still got problems but you've overcome you've overcome the world you've overcome the devil you've overcome all of his imps you've overcome every one of those two hundred thousand thousand demons that have been released on me and you to drive us what back to our homeland which is the word of god not back us to an earthly home no we're going to have that in a thousand years or more we'll have an earthly home here amen because john saw the new city coming down out of heaven we're not going to live on a cloud we're going to live right here because we have conquered amen and took over satan's god bless you i'm sorry let's bow our heads to heavenly father we pray today lord that we'll see those two spirits lord and we'll realize that now even as we speak we know that satan he's he's pulling out all of his best demons to try to turn us away from you but father you just told us that greater is he that's in us than heed us in the world and lord we asked lord that you would help each and every one of us the ones at home mom there lord we read there in isaiah 40 [Music] where you told us lord you said they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint teach me lord teach me lord to wait lord this is such an instant world we have microwaves and we have delivery service next day lord i thought you taught us to have patience [Music] you told us there in isaiah 40 that they that will wait upon the lord shall renew their strength father forgive us of our sins and our daily mistakes that we make lord the things against you lord that not just not the big things lord but the little things lord that we do that's not pleasing to you father we pray forgiveness we pray that you bless each one here lord lord give us something lord to chew on for the rest of the time until wednesday lord we come back in service for you lord we pray that you
