TRANSCRIPT
========================================
t read the birthday list next sunday but it is on january and we got a few that will be this week and uh on the 26th there's a real good birthday coming up so just saying so you may be seated brother aaron where are you at brother come on are you who's leading singing oh oh bob i'm sorry would you come to san just go for us listen i've been taking up offering i got to go back there and run the sound systems okay forgive me god bless you thanks well we took a little detour for a few sundays on the away from hebrews but we'll get back and and uh kind of pick up where we left off if the brothers could go ahead and pull that slide up so let's just kind of recap where we were and then we'll continue on as we read through the book of hebrews um before we get in let's just pray real real quick lord god we thank you for your grace and mercy to us we just asked now as we look into the book of hebrews and study the lord that you'll just open up these things to us and and and and give us something to help us lord jesus christ lord we pray in your name so uh just to kind of recap a little bit we we kind of left off around verses 9 and 13 as we make our way through this chapter and it and verse 9 says but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me now you notice as paul as paul is is preaching it each little each one of these verses is so packed with information and some of these verses he's quoting things from psalms he's quoting from isaiah and he's quoting it almost so fast that that uh he's really assuming that the people that he's speaking to the hebrews haven't have an understanding of the things that he's talking about and so there's so much packed into here so we want to just kind of unpack as we go along and look at some of these things that he's quickly referring to um so if we go to the next slide we see just to kind of recap i know we we've talked about this in some of the earlier little lessons but we see jesus and you know when you when you when as the word begins to open up what we're really looking at is we're looking at a revelation of jesus christ and brother ram said in god's provided place of worship he said uh but lord it does delight our hearts when we see jesus glorified among us so we come to church you know we see a lot of things in the world today we see a lot of things in our personal lives but what we really when we when you begin to see jesus glorified in his people and you see the word begin to open up you're you're you're seeing what what you should see in the word you know even brother brahma said when you you should see jesus in every line of the bible every every every scripture that you read in the bible shall open up jesus to you he said when we see his word which he is the word when we see we can read it here in the bible where he promised he would do it then see him work it right in us oh god how it makes us feel humble that we know that his living presence so we see you as the word is open up you can actually see christ being made manifest in your life and christ manifested in the body of believers and you're seeing god actually work out his his purpose purpose as the word comes off the page into a living reality and and and keep going on to the next slide he said well we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man so christ came down he came down to actually experience the things that we go through and even experience death it takes means to to experience it like psalms 34 says oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him and see paul is trying to he's trying to express to us that we've got a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities because he's he's a he's a high priest that's able to sucker us until later on in this in this chapter he says because he's he's able to come for us comfort us because he's experienced the same things that we go through when you're at a funeral and you see somebody being lowered in the casket in the casket down into the ground christ is able he's he's he was there at lazarus's grave he was there he's experienced death he's tasted all these things so he's able to to he's able to give us comfort and if we go on the next slide it says but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with the glory honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man and and paul he's you know you can you can take away from this that paul's trying to express that that because christ tasted death for every man he took away the sting of death which we read in first corinthians what is this thing of death this thing of death is sin he took away that sting of death because he he gave us the antidote for sin he gave us when he died on the cross and rose so that he could give us he could give us his life back and that that gives you confidence when you're when you come to face that hour of death that christ paid the price for you so that you can come with later on in this chapter paul gets into how the the fear of death has been removed and why is the fear of death removed the sting of death has been removed because because you can come to that hour with confidence that christ paid the price for you when you when you come to come to that place of death you know that that that sin has but the sin problem has been resolved that christ paid the price for you and you can go out down into the grave knowing that that you're you're safe you're safe in christ and that's why paul said in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 57 but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ now in verse 10 paul goes on to say but for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings so he's the captain of our salvation and he was made perfect through suffering there the in the in the garden of gethsemane they're crying out the father let this cup pass for me as he went through all that suffering but he was made the captain of our he's the captain of our salvation and brother brown said the brains of the army lays in his captains the intelligence you know a lot of times we'll think we've we got everything figured out but if we'll just if we'll just follow the captain through the battle as you know you're you've got might have relatives in the hospital or or relatives that are loved ones that are that are lost and and uh not not at the place where they're supposed to be not coming to church but just put everything follow that captain follow follow him and he'll lead you through all the battle and all the sufferings and all the hardships he'll lead you if you follow your captain that brother ham said if he's the right kind of a general if he's the right kind if he's a four-star general if he's proved if he's been proven to be right follow him though it may seem wrong to you go on to the front do as he told you so if we'll just stay in line with god's word everything will work out all right through all the battles and all the sufferings and all the heartaches and and a battle a battle is rough a battle is and that's why brother brown he kept reiterating he wants us to be not little not like not uh you know hot house plants but he wants us to be real soldiers of the cross to stand behind our captain and forge forge ahead into the fight and i'm just trying to recap a little bit before we kind of get into into some of the new new verses that we haven't covered before in verse 11 he says for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one that now that's that's you know he's painting a picture that that the one that's doing the sanctifying the one that came to sanctify us his purpose is to make us all one and and brother brown said don't you see the vine and the branch there in other words that that life that's in the vine it's coming out through the branches the same life that was in him is the same life that is in you the believer because you've been sanctified and cleansed by his word now that's what in john chapter 15 it says i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that then it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you so the thing that's sanctifying us is his word that he's given to us as you receive the word the word is actually claiming your life is taking a hold of your life it's like a you know when the astronauts landed on the moon they put that flag down and they said we've been here and as as you receive the word uh as you receive the word it's like god's taking a claim on your life any and and you go down to the water be baptized and you've done what god said he's taken a claim on your life and you believe and you believe and along as you go along he's he's his word is actually it's claiming you and and and cleansing you from the things of this world now you're clinging to the words which i have spoken unto you you think about you think about the grace that god has given to us that as you receive the word is it's actually changing you so that the as you receive the word precept upon precept to line up online it's adding word upon word and it's changing you from the way that you used to be to until god is molding you into into oneness with him he said abide in me and i and you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing now see that's what paul is really talking about here when he says for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one they've got that same life in them the same life that's in christ is the same life that's in the church the same life that's in the bride for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren right there now let's go to let's go to the next slide paul talking about he's not ashamed to call us brother that he would come down and be associated come down and not humble himself in a little manger so that he could call himself our brothers call himself that to be one of us to be veiled in flesh and robed in flesh so that he could put his own life in us and be called our brother it says he said paul said i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church while i sing praise unto thee now brother ram said he's not ashamed to be called our brother for he was tempted just like we are tempted he's going through the same things the same struggles he was tempted just like we are tempted and he said he can be the right kind of an intercessor because he stood the same kind of a temptation that you stand now you think about that that's a comfort to little children he was a child once adults he's gone through the the same all of the same the same journey and he said he took your place knowing that you couldn't take it yourself and he's the right kind of a chief chief captain of our salvation because he suffered just like we suffered that should give us confidence when we go to the lord in prayer and begin to ask god help i'm i i'm in a straight i'm in a place and knowing that that he was there at the grace of grave of lazarus he wept when lazarus passed away he he was there he he's he's gone through trials just like we have he's been tempted just like we're tempted and he's not ashamed to be called our brother because he knows what we go through with oh blessed be his name now now we think about that as we as we keep going through this chapter chapter saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren that he's not he he's not ashamed to call us his brothers if we go to the next verse and again i will put my trust in him now now he's quoting he's quoting from the book of isaiah again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me now see this is where paul gets into he starts quoting from isaiah and and the people that he's speaking to the hebrews they they are familiar because hebrews studied the old testament scripture they're familiar with these with all these stories and all these little maybe obscure little sayings so paul's saying it real fast but he knows that they they're familiar with the stories but maybe maybe us gentile barbarians are not so familiar with these little these little old these little stories that he's quickly referring to he's the story that he's referring to and my has a story is the story in isaiah chapter 8 where where isaiah is saying and what it actually starts in chapter seven and we'll read it here for a little bit he said bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples and i will wait upon the lord that hide of his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him now paul kind of he kind of rewards it a little bit i'll put my trust in him and then isaiah says behold i and the children whom the lord have given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwelleth in mount zion and paul says he just shortens it he says behold i am the children which god has given me now now to kind of set the the the stage of what paul what isaiah is doing isaiah had these two children that they had they had a name that he gave him if we go to the next slide share joshua meant a remnant will return and maher shalom is meant quick to plunder and swift to spoil god told him to name these two children a name that that everywhere they went they these these two children that he had had a message that they were going to take so you know they'd go to the playground at school or maybe maybe when they got older they went to work and everybody would say hey my heart shallow hosh boss that's that's a fun name to say hey my herschel hushposh you know and then come over here let's let's uh let me talk to you or whatever and every time that they would talk to them or call their name they were they were a message was being delivered to the here you you think about that the same way with when you go to work or the children go to the playground or whatever your life is actually delivering a message and and see that see the message that isaiah had he was saying i and the children and the lord have given me offer signs and for wonders in other words isaiah's message and the children that god had given him with those special names were for signs and wonders to the children of israel so isaiah coupled with those children were a message so you think about now christ came down from glory and he is so she wanted to be called our brethren and so he he had a message and he came down to to share with us his message when you catch that message you've got a message too you've got a message just like isaiah's sons had a message but uh shared jashub and my heart shallow hospitals everywhere they went they were delivering a message and what was their message their message was that if you have confidence the message what kind i'm kind of summarizing before we kind of read some scriptures the message that isaiah was trying to deliver to king ahaz was if you believe in the lord god god is going to deliver you now you know look at the name shall i hear joshua that means that you know war war is going to be inevitable destruction is going to follow there's going to be a lot of hard times but god's going to bring out a little remnant there's still going to be a little remnant that's still going to believe you and my hershey little hotspot is quick to plunder swift to pull spoil he said now watch now god's going to use your in the assyrian army he's going to use the assyrian army to to destroy all your enemies and and there's going to be a lot of spoil and everything but the whole message that these two boys had was that watch watch and see what god is able to do now see uh he so isaiah had these two sons he had these two sons that had a message and uh i'm i'm trying to summarize to save a little time when isaiah in chapter eight when he went to talk to ahaz ahaz was he was a uh he was a little bit scared he was a little bit worried that you know things were not going to work out all right because he was looking at circumstance he was looking at the politics of the day and the great big assyrian army and so isaiah isaiah went to king ahaz and he began to talk to him about uh what the lord had told him and and and in isaiah chapter seven he actually go god told him to take take shaheer share joshua his little boy i don't know how old he was take him with him because that little boy with that name that god's gonna bring a remnant out that little boy was delivering a message so isaiah goes and he's got his he's got his son with him to deliver a message and now now picture this just just to set the context two boys with the message and right there in the middle i i king ahazle begins to kind of doubt whether or not the message of isaiah is correct whether he's telling him something and then isaiah he stops right in the middle and he's so he's got two sons but then he tells him about another son he says i he said therefore the lord he said you want a sign i'll give you a sign therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel and what does the manual mean emmanuel means god with us what's see see how this ties in with what paul's talking about paul's talking about behold i and the children which god has given me he's going back to the prophecy that isaiah gave that god is going to come down and be our brethren that he's not ashamed to be our brother and he's not ashamed to be veiled in flesh and he's going back to the prophecy that isaiah had of a that a virgin shall conceive and in this story that he's telling of these these two sons that isaiah had and and and and the son that was prophesied a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel now if we go which slide are we on yeah let's go to the to the next slide so isaiah if you go back and read isaiah chapter seven and and he talks about a virgin shall conceive chapter eight where he prophesized like a uh before mahershala hospitals was even born god told him that how to name him and and and and wrote it in a scroll and and and then in verse in chapter 9 he said for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given talking about a child coming tie that back with hebrews now behold i am the children which god hath given me but he's talking about a child that's going to come that would not be ashamed to be our brother and to abide with us and go through all of the things that we go through and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsel of the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace now if we go to the next slide let's read this coupled with some other verses in the bible paul said in verse 12 saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren and that's what jesus said in john chapter 7 18 i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gave us me and they have kept thy word and and that's jesus came and he had now we are his children because he manifested his name unto the brethren and now now he's that child that isaiah was talking about now that child has children and we are his children we're begotten of him by his word he said thine they were and thou gave us to me and they have kept thy word in galatians chapter 3 says for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus now to see to how that perfectly that ties in with isaiah 8 18 behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts that means that makes that makes you you tie that in now you are a sign and a wonder because you actually vindicate everything the bible says about you actually vindicate you're a sign that the message is correct because the life that you're living proves out that the words that we've heard the our our brother our prophet preach are correct you're actually the the vindication that is true because when you when you live your life when you go to work when you go to school you actually have a message just like those children of isaiah that that testify that if you'll trust in the lord god will god will win the battle let's keep let's keep going on to the next slide paul said for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage and brother brown said on that day on calvary he said that's what calvary meant men that were in bondage were set free men that were once under fear of death can no longer fear death a man who longs for a city whose builder and maker is god he can step on the highway and set his face towards heaven because he's free he's redeemed he don't need to wonder no more for there's a way of knowing whether you are right or not god gives us life our sins are gone that day at calvary paid the price and that's that's why christ came to take to take away the fear to die for us to take away the fear of death for then you watch how i'm gonna read some quotes here where brother brownlee goes along the fear of death the fear of death firstly the fear of death when you're born again and you realize that that the christ has paid the price for your sins and you've accepted it and you've received that vindication in your soul and you know that if you come to death that there's there's that the problem has been resolved then you know that the fear of death is gone but but yet there's there's still a little bit something brother brown he always talked about early on in his ministry you're like i i'm you know it's an unknown there's always a fear of the unknown like if you if if you were to die without understanding what whether or not you're you're going to be a solid entity whether or not you can shake your brother's hands over there what whether or not what whether or not your their soul sleeping is true whether you're going to just going to be like it like this and like gone until until the resurrection and then you come back into a body all those things there's still like a little fear there see what the message has done for us it took away all the fear it took away all the fear because we know where we're going right and then brother brown said now on the next slide he said of course we do he said there's no need of fear and death of course we do when none of us want to die we we what we call died he said but now of course going down to the highlighted part we being human walking these dark elements here we do not understand it as we should he said but if we can just look beyond the curtain yonder there is where it's at and now this is what paul is talking about that he took away the fear that he took away the sting of death but now i i want to take it a little bit further and the message that brother branham gave us to take it took away completely the fear of dying and and i'm running out of time here so brother ryan said he he got to when he's when he went beyond the curtain of time he said i do not fear death he said before he was like you know there's still a little bit of fear of the unknown but when he went beyond the curtain of time he said i do not fear i have not one fear of death death has no fear at all and it doesn't for you if you just understood you know when you see a loved one not we've got i've we've heard so many testimonies of people dying and then uh seeing somebody across the curtain of time just as they're dead as they're dying and you know when you hear about people that you used to know on the other side that gives you confidence that there's a land beyond the river that gives you confidence as there's a place that you're going to we were talking about um i i'm drawing a blank at the brother's name but he used to be an evangelist and then he passed away years ago and a little sister that we know passed away and she he always had a great sense of humor and she when she was passing away she she she saw him on the other side and she came back and she said you know that brother still has the same sense of humor that he did here and another story we were talking about this this little sister that uh uh she uh she passed away and a lot of people said well you know she was always kind of a little bit crabby with her husband and everything and she she you know something and some people were kind of wondering if if she went to heaven or not but but th this this uh this little sister she was on her deathbed and she looked and she said there's their sister so-and-so she's coming to meet me at the river you see how sometimes we fail to give grace when when but what confidence that gives to know that the ones that have gone on before what are they waiting for us on the other on the other side the musicians should go ahead and come forward that takes away the fear of death and we'll we'll in there [Applause]
