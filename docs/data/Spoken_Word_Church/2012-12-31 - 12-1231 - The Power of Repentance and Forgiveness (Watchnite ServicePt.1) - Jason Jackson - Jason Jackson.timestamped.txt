[6:48] the word Psalms chap 32 and verse
[6:54] 5
[6:56] and I was given a little extra time
[6:58] tonight so
[7:00] amen amen W Cy hit me cuz I didn't
[7:03] preach long enough yesterday but he
[7:04] wasn't here
[7:07] so open up then brother Toren told me I
[7:10] had lot more time tonight too so
[7:13] Terrence rather and
[7:15] so T
[7:19] ter long as we don't forget to call him
[7:21] for
[7:24] supper Psalms 32 and verse 5 I
[7:28] acknowledge my sin
[7:30] unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid
[7:33] I said I will confess my transgressions
[7:35] unto the Lord and thou forgave us the
[7:38] iniquity of my sin CA may God that is
[7:41] blessing you may be seated this
[7:43] evening I want to just look at if we can
[7:46] for a little while this evening on the
[7:49] power of repentance and
[7:52] forgiveness and actually I got this
[7:55] thought sometime back I was laying in
[7:57] bed one morning about 3:00 and I woke up
[7:59] and I had my iPod going and I I heard
[8:02] the words from Brother R say
[8:06] repent right so I began looking at that
[8:10] and going through the scriptures and
[8:12] studying it and and actually it goes
[8:15] together repentance goes together with
[8:18] forgiveness right amen and actually
[8:21] before repentance confession precedes
[8:25] that right right because if you don't
[8:27] confess that you're wrong how are you
[8:29] you ever going to repent amen right so
[8:32] so there's a great power in in the
[8:34] prayer of repentance there's healing in
[8:35] Repentance amen second chonicles 7 said
[8:38] If my people who are called by my name
[8:40] will humble there's the key humble
[8:43] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[8:47] turn from their Wicked Ways then I will
[8:49] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[8:52] sin and will heal their land so
[8:55] forgiveness and healing are available
[8:58] when we turn from from our wickedness
[9:01] and when we repent of the sin that's in
[9:03] our lives amen Jason why are you
[9:05] preaching on repentance tonight cuz
[9:07] everyone of us he Paul said I die day so
[9:11] every one of us has a level of
[9:13] repentance that we have to do and every
[9:15] one of us is on the on the scale of 1 to
[9:18] 10 we all fit in here somewhere on the
[9:20] Forgiveness level also there's those we
[9:22] need to forgive and and we need
[9:25] forgiveness amen so and the power of
[9:29] repent begins with a humble
[9:32] confession and the acknowledgment of who
[9:35] we are and what we have done Amen
[9:38] brother Brandon says this in
[9:40] Perfection I'll give him a second to get
[9:43] it on the on the
[9:46] screen he says what is it oh God
[9:50] requires Perfection amen he requires
[9:53] your repentance he requires your loyalty
[9:56] to him amen but he's looking tonight no
[10:00] matter how much you sin or how little or
[10:02] how much you're still a sinner right and
[10:05] you cannot you cannot get it no other
[10:08] way but by Jesus Christ God's all
[10:10] sufficient sacrifice and in him you are
[10:13] perfected forever think of it it's not
[10:16] nothing you do right it's not turning a
[10:19] new page no it's not a new life you
[10:23] start it's a confession of your wrong
[10:26] and God's grace to you that bring brings
[10:29] you to Perfection and you are perfected
[10:33] in Christ Jesus so joining a church will
[10:35] never cover your sin right joining the
[10:38] church will never change your desires or
[10:40] change your life or change anything
[10:43] about all joining the church does is
[10:45] join is CH you jump from this one to
[10:47] this one all it does is change where
[10:50] you're dwelling out with exactly where
[10:51] you're fellowshipping with but if you
[10:54] still have a problem right you're the
[10:56] problem right right that's right I heard
[10:58] you've heard people say I I just need to
[11:00] change jobs I I just yeah you better get
[11:03] that out my way I just need to change
[11:06] jobs I need to I need to change I need
[11:08] to move from where I'm at and everything
[11:10] will be better everything won't be
[11:12] better because the trouble will follow
[11:15] you the first thing Lord what is wrong
[11:18] where's the problem at God remember said
[11:21] the problem's not your brother the
[11:22] problem not your sister the problem is
[11:25] me right exactly I'm the one that gets
[11:27] in the way I'm my work
[11:31] enemy and if I can recognize Lord I am
[11:34] my worst enemy I am confessing that to
[11:37] you I am going to repent and repent is
[11:40] not just to say well Lord I'm sorry
[11:42] right right right come on brother that's
[11:45] not repentance repentance is to turn
[11:47] away from what you're doing and go a
[11:50] different direction that's real
[11:53] repentance so no and brother says like
[11:56] this no drye confession will ever cover
[11:59] your sin no sir
[12:01] amen right it takes Godly
[12:05] sorrow and repentance and the grace of
[12:08] God to cover sin for the blood of Jesus
[12:13] Christ the one that God killed that
[12:15] Calvary to cover your sin that's God's
[12:18] provided way is repentance confession
[12:22] showing a result he said bringing forth
[12:24] meat of repentance showing sincerity
[12:27] right come on he carth for you he cares
[12:31] that you care rather right he said Peter
[12:34] said repent and be baptized in the name
[12:37] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[12:40] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[12:43] the Holy Ghost right that's right glory
[12:46] to God when when you not just say well
[12:49] you know I come up here and I give a
[12:50] little dry-eyed confession and or maybe
[12:52] I I dabbed a couple of tears away listen
[12:55] you have to die repentance means to die
[12:59] out and to change directions and I'm not
[13:03] living that way anymore I'm not going
[13:05] that direction anymore I don't have time
[13:08] to go that way
[13:09] anymore I have started a new route now
[13:13] and I repented of my sins I've been
[13:15] baptized and now he has promised to give
[13:19] me the gift of the Holy Ghost he said
[13:21] when you thoroughly repent and believe
[13:24] on the Lord and are baptized in the name
[13:26] of Jesus Christ that's right you may
[13:29] make God a liar if you don't receive the
[13:31] Holy
[13:33] Ghost and God is not no
[13:36] liar listen he can do a lot of things
[13:39] but he can't
[13:40] lie and he can't fail right right many
[13:45] people in the church in the world today
[13:47] Desir to be delivered mhm but how bad do
[13:52] they desire it right right righten they
[13:54] want to be free from guilt free from
[13:57] chains that have them Bound for so long
[13:59] right right but they aren't ready to
[14:03] acknowledge and take our own
[14:06] responsibility that's it there's the key
[14:09] and and take responsibility for their
[14:11] behavior take responsibility for their
[14:13] actions right and they always going to
[14:15] say well the devil made me do it yeah oh
[14:21] yeah brother re he's the quot I think
[14:23] it's in' 64 65 and I can't remember the
[14:26] message but he says he says oh brother
[14:29] Brandon he said oh the devil made me
[14:31] commit
[14:32] adultery he said the devil didn't make
[14:35] you commit adultery he said if the devil
[14:38] made you commit adultery and you were
[14:40] full of the Holy Ghost then he had to be
[14:42] born again just like you are and then
[14:45] he'd be your brother cuz when God is
[14:47] sealed in the devil sealed
[14:50] outly amen he ain't my brother right oh
[14:54] no I'm not no K to him right amen
[14:59] fact we live in a world today in an age
[15:02] when no one wants to take responsibility
[15:04] for anything that's right well the devil
[15:06] made me do it or the preacher made me do
[15:08] it or the Deacon made me do it or Wade
[15:09] made me do it or somebody else my wife
[15:11] made me do it nobody everybody just
[15:13] wants to pass the buck along that's the
[15:16] way it's been since a garden of me and
[15:18] since the woman you gave me right yeah
[15:22] exactly oh God yes God help us amen I'm
[15:27] not going to ask any husbands in or not
[15:29] how many has ever said that Lord the
[15:31] woman you give
[15:33] me careful huh careful okay I'll skip
[15:36] that part of the
[15:39] message and you know every court trial
[15:42] actually begins with a plea that's right
[15:44] yes sir most people begin to ple of not
[15:47] guilty that's right all right we have
[15:49] you on video surveillance we saw you

[16:11] then the trial begins and you know hey
[16:14] what one excuse after another excuse
[16:17] after another excuse and you know cuz it
[16:19] it wasn't the guilty party's fault no
[16:21] right you take marriages when they fall
[16:24] apart nobody's at fault
[16:26] right well I didn't know it was her I
[16:29] didn't know it was
[16:32] him if he had just acted better she had
[16:35] just acted better see somebody's got to
[16:38] accept the responsibility and say Lord
[16:41] maybe it's me that needs to die maybe it
[16:44] is me that accept Paul help me if I'm
[16:48] wrong yes
[16:50] sir nobody wants to accept it nobody
[16:53] wants to accept sin in their life I'm
[16:55] guilty of sin yeah no we make excuses
[16:58] yeah and try to cover it up and try to
[17:00] pass the buck Hey listen the Deliverance
[17:04] portion of the cycle begins with
[17:07] confession and if you can't fess up to
[17:09] it to what we have done we will never
[17:12] ever experience the power of repentance
[17:16] right amen we'll never experience the
[17:18] power of even forgiveness right amen cuz
[17:22] what a change it makes it our life when
[17:25] Jesus comes in and he sets you free and
[17:28] Paul said that is therefore no
[17:30] condemnation any longer to them that are
[17:33] in
[17:35] Christ so we're just going in a cycle
[17:38] hide didn't do it tonight it ain't my
[17:39] fault yeah people get fired from a job I
[17:42] don't know why the boss fired me yeah I
[17:45] mean he caught me asleep for an hour and
[17:47] a half but you know it wasn't right fa
[17:50] yeah well whose was
[17:53] it
[17:56] right what me brother Jon well amen he
[17:59] wasn't your boss's fault he don't got to
[18:01] set the alarm clock to wake you up from
[18:03] lunch right and often we find ourselves
[18:07] become bogged down even by difficult
[18:10] situations that we need God's delivering
[18:14] Grace
[18:15] from but often but God will often wait
[18:18] and and for the burden and the
[18:20] consequence because now it's it's
[18:22] pushing down and we won't admit to it so
[18:24] now here comes one thing and here comes
[18:26] one thing and here comes another thing
[18:28] and if you are the elected seed of God
[18:31] God is going to get you to the place
[18:32] sooner or later till you're willing to
[18:35] make a confession that I'm wrong exactly
[18:39] amen right oh God that's right if you're
[18:43] the elect he's going to get you one way
[18:45] or the other he's going to call
[18:47] something to Humble you amen amen thank
[18:50] you
[18:51] Lord listen when you begin to
[18:54] confess you know you you watch the story
[18:57] unfold of David for 2 Samuel chter
[19:03] 12 David
[19:05] he the scripture tells us that he's a
[19:08] man after God's Own
[19:09] Heart and David he he was in love with
[19:13] God but he was also in love with women
[19:15] yeah right he had plenty of them 500
[19:19] wives or whatever and 300
[19:22] concubines Lord one yeah one I can Mar
[19:28] they afford one one yeah yeah
[19:30] right praise the Lord I don't need
[19:34] 500 I don't need
[19:36] two right but David he here he was and
[19:41] and the prophet comes to him one day and
[19:44] the na unto David and he came and unto
[19:47] him and he said there were two men in
[19:48] one city and one was rich and the other
[19:50] one was poor and the rich one had an
[19:52] exceeding many flocking and herds but
[19:54] the poor man had nothing but one little
[19:56] bitty lamb yeah right one little bitty L
[19:59] yeah which he had brought and nursed and
[20:02] grew up together with him and with his
[20:04] children and and then eat of his own
[20:06] meat and it drank of his own cup and lay
[20:09] in his bosom and it was as unto him as a
[20:11] daughter and and and there came a
[20:13] traveler unto the rich man and he spared
[20:17] to take of his own block and of his own
[20:19] herd to dress for the warfaring man and
[20:22] that was coming to him but he took the
[20:24] poor man's lamb and he dressed it for
[20:27] the man yeah course you know the
[20:29] scripture says more blessed is it to
[20:33] take that's what that's what the man's
[20:35] thinking you I'll take from him I'll
[20:36] keep what I've got right yeah actually
[20:39] the scripture says more blessed is it to
[20:41] give than it is to
[20:42] receive but David and David's
[20:46] anger rose up in him and he greatly
[20:49] kindled against the man and he said to
[20:51] Nathan as the Lord liveth the man have
[20:54] done this thing shall surely die right
[20:57] now watch watch the Judgment he's good
[21:01] exactly how many times do we the
[21:03] scripture also tells us judge nothing
[21:05] before sign and here's David given
[21:09] judgment for what the man was that was
[21:12] just above it little did David know he
[21:15] was the man cuz this was just a parable
[21:17] to David and David didn't catch what was
[21:20] going on now he's telling David he just
[21:24] David tells him he said this man shall
[21:25] die and he shall restore the lamb for
[21:28] old because he did this thing and
[21:30] because he had no pity and Nathan said
[21:33] to David you're man right I don't want
[21:38] to
[21:39] die thus say the Lord God of Israel I
[21:42] anointed thee King over Israel I
[21:44] delivered thee out of the hand of
[21:46] Saul and David and he begins to tell
[21:49] David what his punishment will be yeah
[21:52] his punishment wasn't what David was
[21:54] going to punish himself with right but
[21:57] God had a plan amen yeah and God says
[21:59] and I gave thee thy Master's house and
[22:02] thy Master's wives into thy bosom and
[22:04] gave Thee the house of Israel and of
[22:05] Judah and it and if that had been too
[22:09] little I would moreover have given thee
[22:11] such and such things wherefore thou Hast
[22:14] despise the Commandment of the Lord to
[22:16] do evil in his sight thou has killed
[22:19] Uriah the hittite with the sword and has
[22:22] taken his wife to to be thy wife and has
[22:25] slain him with the sword of the children
[22:27] of ammono right now therefore the sword
[22:30] shall never depart from thine house
[22:33] exactly because thou has despised me yet

[26:45] into our voice how will he then Vex
[26:48] himself if we tell him that the child is

[29:24] right right cuz it's all in God's Tim
[29:27] right amen and God's way righten and as
[29:30] I thought on my way brother says I
[29:32] wonder tonight and and wouldn't say this
[29:34] but maybe there'd be another David
[29:36] sitting here tonight that's as guilty as
[29:38] David
[29:39] was and when you turn your light out at
[29:42] night you see your brother's face yeah
[29:45] the man that you defiled his loving wife
[29:48] broke up his home yeah flickering on the
[29:52] side of your wall right or some woman
[29:54] you see the woman's home that she broke
[29:56] up by running off with her husband yeah
[29:59] it ought to bring you to repentance and
[30:01] sackcloth and confession what the church
[30:04] needs tonight is a confession right and
[30:07] making right to come back to the
[30:10] testimonies of the Lord there's Mercy
[30:13] forgiveness seems that it would haunt
[30:15] people going on know that you're walking
[30:19] hour by hour in the face of death why do
[30:22] we continue on with selfishness and
[30:24] greed and
[30:25] ungodliness right and our eyes on the
[30:28] things of the world is time we turn back
[30:30] to God testimonies to God testimon as I
[30:33] follow on my ways I turn my feet to thy
[30:36] testimony amen amen know I think of the
[30:40] the lady who was losing her
[30:42] mind and she'd been in ever insane
[30:44] institution and tried to get help
[30:46] everywhere right I'll try to stay behind
[30:48] up here
[30:50] brother and he says I I tried to you
[30:53] know I've tried to Adit at everything
[30:56] and I and I can't find peace
[30:58] and they can't find out what's wrong
[31:00] with me right and brother B looks at her
[31:02] and in just 5 minutes time or less he
[31:05] says I'll tell you what's wrong and the
[31:07] doctors and the psychiatrist and nobody
[31:09] else will ever find it and you'll never
[31:12] get any better unless you repent
[31:15] right well what is it brother bam he
[31:17] said 20 something or 30 years ago you
[31:20] were in a green
[31:22] dress and you and another man had an
[31:25] affair right she said but brother brand
[31:28] I repented of that yeah to
[31:31] God he says you didn't sin against
[31:35] God yeah come on he sinned against his
[31:39] wife or she sinned against her husband
[31:41] that b Sinn against his wife right and
[31:44] he said the only way you'll ever get
[31:46] Deliverance is to go make it right
[31:51] right she said my husband would leave me
[31:53] it would be over with you know I I can't
[31:55] do that he says then go on you're not
[31:58] going to get any better you're going to
[31:59] continue you're going to lose your full
[32:01] mind and finally finally he says okay
[32:03] I'll tell you something else your
[32:06] husband has the same thing to tell you
[32:08] right yeah and it happened day before
[32:10] yesterday or last week it was the woman
[32:13] he was what was in a pink dress and he
[32:14] was in a Chevrolet car on the other side
[32:16] of the railroad track and she said not
[32:17] my husband he said go get him yeah
[32:22] right bring him here they leave and
[32:25] sister goes you think they'll be back he
[32:26] goes they'll be back
[32:28] yeah it wasn't wrong here they came yeah
[32:31] and there he began to make his
[32:33] confession she made her confession her
[32:36] mind comes back to her she is restored
[32:40] again and he's a deacon in the local
[32:42] church down the road and he said I'm
[32:44] going to go home and resign and the
[32:46] prophet said no you go back and continue
[32:48] as you
[32:49] are they figure that one out
[32:52] yeah abolutely right brother
[32:57] that's right sometimes we put God in a
[32:59] box yeah and just about the time we put
[33:02] him in a box by the way he blows the top
[33:05] of
[33:06] it I would have thought he stood re but
[33:08] see we miss the power of repentance we
[33:12] miss the power of that forgiveness that
[33:14] come you miss the power of the
[33:18] blood thank you Jesus what can wash away
[33:21] my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus
[33:25] what can make me whole again nothing but
[33:28] the blood right Lord so then repentance
[33:31] is more than just a confession right
[33:34] right amen repentance frees you from
[33:39] your
[33:40] sin amen hallelujah the sin that has
[33:43] held you bow when you really repent it
[33:47] frees you from that right amen
[33:50] confession is just an acknowledgement of
[33:52] the sin right repentance is an actual
[33:54] turning yeah right from that sin right
[33:58] and going a different
[34:02] direction brother l i i i repented of
[34:05] that online
[34:07] pornography but I went back to it the
[34:09] next
[34:10] day you didn't repent right you might
[34:14] have made a confession which was
[34:16] starting that way but the repentance was
[34:19] I ain't going back to that right exactly
[34:22] oh that thing's not going to continue to
[34:24] follow me oh brother it went through my
[34:26] whole family and you know it's just
[34:28] something I have to live with because my
[34:30] daddy fought with that battle and my
[34:32] mama fought with that battle or my great
[34:35] great grandpa was high Pastor let me
[34:37] tell you there ain't nothing in this
[34:39] world that the Holy Ghost can't
[34:41] control and if you have a problem with
[34:44] something committed to the Holy
[34:46] Ghost the prophet said that little girl
[34:50] there that had the epilepsy that came
[34:53] from her great great grandmother right
[34:55] but he said as I was saved when that
[34:57] Abstract title deed comes and she
[35:00] receives the Holy Ghost everything that
[35:02] was ever held against her is then stri
[35:05] it
[35:06] off exactly that's the power right of
[35:11] this
[35:14] word sorry
[35:16] bu we was even talking today I believe
[35:19] it was brother w we don't understand
[35:21] things when God tells a prophet to go
[35:23] marry a right absolutely huh he
[35:25] says go marry a woman of whoredom yep y
[35:28] that blows our minds cuz that's against
[35:30] the levitical law right right but who
[35:33] can figure out the ways of God right no
[35:37] nobody can no so this was more
[35:41] repentance and changing and and and and
[35:44] and confession it's more than just
[35:46] saying the way I lived was wrong yeah
[35:49] right amen changing the way you live
[35:51] right Hosea 14:1 says oh Israel
[35:55] returning to the Lord thy God amen for
[35:58] thou H has fallen by thine iniquity take
[36:01] with you words and turn to the Lord and
[36:04] say unto him take away all iniquity and
[36:07] receive us graciously so we will render
[36:10] the calves of our lips as sure shall not
[36:13] save us we will not ride up horses
[36:16] neither will we say anymore to the work
[36:18] of our hands you are Gods you are our
[36:21] gods for in thee the fatherless find
[36:24] Mercy I will heal their backsliding will
[36:27] love them freely for my anger is turned
[36:31] from them right right that's what looks
[36:36] like oh here in this
[36:38] verse verse 1 through3 for the Lord ha
[36:42] stumbled we have stumbled because of
[36:45] your iniquity take take words with you
[36:48] return to the Lord right and say to him
[36:51] take away our iniquity forgive us of our
[36:54] sin we're not going to do the things we
[36:56] once did we're not going to worship
[36:58] these people we're not going to tell
[37:00] them they're our gods they had a
[37:01] confession and they had a real
[37:03] repentance amen amen then what happens
[37:07] God always comes by and would heal their
[37:09] Nation absolutely amen heal their land
[37:13] and if a person will ever completely
[37:15] come clean right right then they'll
[37:19] never if they don't come clean they'll
[37:20] never experience the power of exactly
[37:23] you see people Bound in mental
[37:25] conditions and most of the time I'm not
[37:27] saying every time most of the time when
[37:29] people have things like this and they
[37:31] have demons upon them something happened
[37:33] somewhere to allow that Spirit to come
[37:36] in right and if they try to go around
[37:39] the bush about it or beat around the
[37:41] bush and they never will come clean with
[37:43] it then they'll never really get
[37:46] Deliverance you can put them in
[37:47] hospitals you can put them in AA
[37:50] meetings or whatever they are alcohol
[37:52] and on you can put them in rehab and it
[37:54] might help the person get free from that
[37:56] but it don't deliver them from the
[37:58] spirit it takes the power of the Holy
[38:01] Ghost to come down and
[38:06] deliver
[38:09] brother praise the
[38:11] Lord constantly you see people they

[49:29] greatest
[49:30] difficulties in the way of forgiving our

[49:34] yeah right now listen I can
[49:39] understand Sinners not forgiving one
[49:42] another right right I can totally get
[49:44] that right but what I can't figure out
[49:47] is how people and I don't know none get
[49:49] problems here so I'm how people go ahead

[50:11] sit in church together come on brother
[50:14] how can they sit there with bitterness
[50:17] in their hearts how can we sit there

[1:07:23] of the problem and cut down this part of
[1:07:24] the problem well if you don't get the
[1:07:26] root out it's going to grow again as
[1:07:27] soon as a little somebody comes by
[1:07:29] sprinkles a little bit of water on that

[1:07:55] the roots more valuable to me than the
[1:07:57] blessings of God and I'm holding on to
[1:07:59] that root and it's more fulfilling to me
[1:08:02] and I think more about that that I do

[1:16:13] there's a brother one time he was he was
[1:16:15] crippled and he was in a wheelchair and
[1:16:17] he couldn't get out of his wheelchair
[1:16:18] very just to walk around the bar one day
[1:16:21] he got up and he was walking his way
[1:16:22] around the bar and he was getting him a
[1:16:24] glass of tea
[1:16:25] did and he's depressed and he said Lord
[1:16:29] just wished I could hear you tell
[1:16:31] me verbally your voice Lord I just wish
[1:16:35] I could hear you tell me that you love
[1:16:39] me and his pastor's out working in his
[1:16:43] barn and the spirit of the Lord comes on
[1:16:46] him and says call brother so and so and
[1:16:49] tell him that I love him amen praise the
[1:16:52] Lord right right amen right
[1:16:55] he said I just picked up the phone
[1:16:58] brother I don't know why I'm calling you
[1:17:01] other than the Lord just told me to call
[1:17:03] you and tell you that he loved you amen
[1:17:07] listen God's mindful of his children
[1:17:10] whatever we have need of Lord I need you
[1:17:12] tonight more than I need healing in my
[1:17:15] body I need salvation I need the
[1:17:17] whatever you have need of just breathe
[1:17:19] it to him Lord I need it and he's ever
[1:17:21] present there to give you what you need
[1:17:30] right ever presentent help in the time
[1:17:32] of TR amen that's
[1:17:34] right enemy comes in God raises it up
[1:17:38] enemy comes in and if you ain't up where
[1:17:39] you need in a couple of weeks you're
[1:17:40] going to be overflowed that's right yeah
[1:17:43] right right and everything's going to be
[1:17:45] going haywi you're going to wonder why
[1:17:47] am I sinking but if you're sinking do
[1:17:51] like Peter did cry out for help Lord
[1:17:55] save me amen listen at least he made a
[1:17:59] step at least he stepped out by faith to
[1:18:01] begin with yeah he began to look at the
[1:18:03] circumstances and he might have began to
[1:18:05] doubt a little bit and he began to sink
[1:18:08] down a little bit but Jesus was there to
[1:18:10] pick him up and his despair when he
[1:18:13] recognized his wrong he asked for
[1:18:19] mercy God says those that draw nigh to
[1:18:22] me I'll draw nigh to live
[1:18:27] amen amen now Jesus says the prayer in
[1:18:30] Matthew chapter
[1:18:32] 6 teaches his disciples how to pray
[1:18:37] right and the
[1:18:40] prayer says forgive us our
[1:18:43] trespasses as we forgive those who
[1:18:47] trespass against
[1:18:49] us right now if you pray that prayer
[1:18:52] yeah that's the most scariest
[1:18:55] prayer right in the entire Bible right
[1:18:58] list how is that scary cuz you're asking
[1:19:01] God right to forgive me like I forgive
[1:19:06] others come on now come on and if you
[1:19:10] don't forgive others right you don't get
[1:19:12] forgiveness exactly your your
[1:19:15] forgiveness is based on how you forgive
[1:19:17] others right Lord forgive me like I
[1:19:20] forgive others right mm that's that's
[1:19:22] pretty that's pretty scary right but
[1:19:24] that's why what we're asking right right
[1:19:26] listen oh they did this that doesn't
[1:19:29] matter forgive them move on if you don't
[1:19:32] it'll destroy you will amen yes sir it
[1:19:35] will I've seen families destroyed I've
[1:19:37] seen individuals destroyed all because
[1:19:39] they kept something in their heart that
[1:19:42] if they' only said you know what they
[1:19:44] didn't mean to do that right I know they
[1:19:47] did
[1:19:50] well come on brother that Spirit meant
[1:19:52] to do it right but they didn't to do it
[1:19:55] right right oh God Jesus telling them
[1:19:59] how to forgive and how often to
[1:20:03] forgive and the disciples said Lord
[1:20:07] increase our faith right cuz without
[1:20:10] faith it is impossible to please
[1:20:14] God listen you know the story there in
[1:20:16] Luke chapter 5 verse 17 there's a man
[1:20:20] who's lowed down through the roof and on
[1:20:21] a certain day as he was teaching and
[1:20:24] there was the es and the doctors of the
[1:20:25] law sitting by yeah which were come out
[1:20:28] of every town of Galilee in Judea
[1:20:31] right and behold men brought in a bed
[1:20:34] which was taken when man was taken with
[1:20:36] a py and they sought means to bring him
[1:20:38] in and they lay lay him before him and
[1:20:41] when they could not find they could not
[1:20:44] find by what way they might bring him in
[1:20:46] because of the multitude they went up on
[1:20:48] the house stop talk about faith we're
[1:20:50] going to get there whatever it takes
[1:20:51] we're get to Jesus and they let him down
[1:20:54] through the tiling and his couching into
[1:20:56] the midst before Jesus and when he saw
[1:20:59] their faith he said unto the man man thy
[1:21:02] sins are forgiven right what's
[1:21:05] forgiveness of sins got to do with being
[1:21:07] well right come on
[1:21:09] brother huh and the scribes and the
[1:21:11] Pharisees began to reason saying who is
[1:21:15] this which speaketh blasphemies yeah who
[1:21:18] can forgive sins but God Alone Oh yeah
[1:21:21] they didn't know who was in their midst
[1:21:23] right right it was
[1:21:26] God Emmanuel made flesh standing there
[1:21:30] able to forgive sin before the blood was
[1:21:33] even shed that's right that's right yes
[1:21:37] sir God but when Jesus perceived their
[1:21:40] thoughts he answering said unto them
[1:21:44] what reason you in your heart whether it
[1:21:47] is easier to say thy sins be forgiven or
[1:21:49] to say rise and walk right cuz if his
[1:21:52] sins were forgiven he was
[1:21:55] rise
[1:21:57] right amen but that you may know the son
[1:22:00] of man have power upon Earth to forgive
[1:22:02] sins amen he said unto the sick of PA I
[1:22:05] say unto you arise take up thy couch and
[1:22:09] go into thy house right amen glor see
[1:22:13] what God's looking for is respect sir
[1:22:17] glor right he respects the faith that's
[1:22:21] in the individual right yeah right mhm
[1:22:24] that's even why that's why even brother
[1:22:26] said prostitutes could come through the
[1:22:28] prayer line right and receive their
[1:22:30] healing yeah right and real Born Again
[1:22:33] Believers miss it yeah right and I was
[1:22:37] and I preached on that one night and I
[1:22:39] was down at McDonald's and a sister
[1:22:40] asked me said I don't
[1:22:43] understand how people can walk up and be
[1:22:46] healed before they get to their seat and
[1:22:48] they're sin in their
[1:22:50] lives I said help me Lord yeah come on
[1:22:56] and I just open my mouth start speaking
[1:22:58] Yeah take no thought of what you saying
[1:23:00] that now that's right right that's right
[1:23:02] Lord help me yeah right he said it
[1:23:05] wasn't their
[1:23:07] prayer it was their faith in the prayer
[1:23:10] right it was their faith if they got
[1:23:12] before brother b or if they got before
[1:23:13] whoever to anoint them and pray for
[1:23:16] that's going to be made well G so it was
[1:23:19] faith God respects the faith he said
[1:23:21] that's in the
[1:23:23] individual and James 5:14 he said if any
[1:23:26] sick are among you let them call the
[1:23:28] Elders of the church let them anoint
[1:23:30] them in all and pray over them and the
[1:23:33] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[1:23:36] if they've done any sin it shall be
[1:23:39] forgiven
[1:23:41] them talk about power in this word the
[1:23:45] power of forgiveness the power of
[1:23:48] repentance can't you see the benefits a
[1:23:50] Believer
[1:23:52] has amen man there's healing there's
[1:23:54] forgiveness there's joy there's peace
[1:23:56] there's happiness there thank you Jesus
[1:23:59] Hallelujah there's all kinds of things
[1:24:02] right when Jesus when Jesus was dying he
[1:24:05] uttered some of the most powerful words
[1:24:08] y that would ever be uttered upon Earth
[1:24:12] yeah but in Jesus is dying he's
[1:24:14] expecting in 3 days to resurrect yeah
[1:24:17] all right in three days it's going to be
[1:24:20] the biggest event that's ever happened
[1:24:22] yet amen
[1:24:24] but if he don't get up from the
[1:24:28] grave there is no New Testament
[1:24:31] Church there is no Pentecost there is no
[1:24:35] any of those things if he don't raise
[1:24:37] from the grave hey we're all lost right
[1:24:41] but Jesus in his dying moments thought
[1:24:44] enough about it to stop y right and say
[1:24:49] father forgive them right amen they
[1:24:52] don't even know what they're doing right
[1:24:54] that's right yes sir bu and if Jesus
[1:24:56] thought enough about
[1:24:58] that what about us right right come on
[1:25:03] sir listen Jesus could have not have
[1:25:05] raised Lazarus from the grave that never
[1:25:07] would have changed one thing no right he
[1:25:09] could have not ever healed the leopards
[1:25:11] it never would have changed one thing
[1:25:13] but if he didn't forgive those men and
[1:25:15] he didn't go down in that grave and he
[1:25:17] didn't resurrected out of that grave Hey
[1:25:19] listen we ain't having church tonight
[1:25:22] exactly we're still under the blood of
[1:25:24] PS and goat but because he was able as
[1:25:28] even a man when he went to the cross
[1:25:31] that Spirit left him and he had to die a
[1:25:34] man cuz the spirit can't
[1:25:36] die right and when he went up there as
[1:25:40] even that he said father I pray that you
[1:25:43] forgive them right yeah and then after
[1:25:46] him here comes along Steven he was a
[1:25:48] deacon in the church right right and he
[1:25:51] testified and did all kinds of things
[1:25:53] and even Apostle Paul hel his cloak
[1:25:54] while he was stoned to death and and and
[1:25:57] Steven sat there and he says the exact
[1:25:59] same words Jesus did right am cuz he's a
[1:26:01] Son of
[1:26:03] God father forgive them they don't know
[1:26:06] what they're doing and when offenses
[1:26:08] comes to a Believer we should say father
[1:26:11] forgive them they don't know what
[1:26:14] they're
[1:26:15] doing exactly right amen it don't matter
[1:26:19] if he never heals your body right that's
[1:26:21] right come on right right now exactly
[1:26:24] you can't forgive right you can't be
[1:26:29] forgiven and when Jesus was riled upon
[1:26:33] he didn't R back right and when evil oh
[1:26:36] this is when evil was spoken of him he
[1:26:40] didn't speak evil back right right
[1:26:44] amen come on yes Hallelujah everybody
[1:26:49] shall yes it's hard yeah right when
[1:26:54] somebody's giving you down the road oh
[1:26:56] yeah and somebody's always persecuting
[1:26:59] you
[1:27:00] yeah it's hard right but you have to
[1:27:04] make the decision to rise above it
[1:27:07] listen you've got to make the decision I
[1:27:10] don't have the
[1:27:12] time to give into this bitterness or to
[1:27:15] get into this unforgiving Spirit I've
[1:27:18] got better things to be doing right
[1:27:24] praise God brother that's what Jesus
[1:27:26] taught the disciples in Matthew chapter
[1:27:28] 6 M yeah Y and all of us are on some
[1:27:31] level as I said that when we first
[1:27:34] started that we need
[1:27:35] forgiveness or we need to show
[1:27:37] forgiveness right Jesus forgive them
[1:27:41] without them ever asking him right to
[1:27:45] forgive them right exactly they never
[1:27:47] said forgive us I still
[1:27:50] got
[1:27:52] B it's all right
[1:27:56] good he forgive him without them asking
[1:27:58] him to right and he was willing to
[1:28:01] forgive you right amen thank you Lord
[1:28:04] listen when you are yet a sinner right
[1:28:08] you are in his mind very Calvary you
[1:28:11] never even asked him to forgive you but
[1:28:14] he forgave you before you ever even
[1:28:17] asked forgiv he already knew you would
[1:28:21] be
[1:28:23] forgiven Hallelujah That's The Power of
[1:28:26] my God that's right amen that Sinners
[1:28:28] men that could be born in sin and shaped
[1:28:31] in iniquity who could be worthless scum
[1:28:34] of the earth yet he can reach down his
[1:28:37] hand for you and pick you up out of a
[1:28:42] pit and know your very desire of your
[1:28:47] heart Thank You
[1:28:49] Lord says this in 1950
[1:28:55] so there was a lady come across the
[1:28:57] platform another instance and I took a
[1:28:59] hold of her hand and she had a female
[1:29:02] vibration and I said you have female
[1:29:04] trouble and she had a little boy on her
[1:29:06] arm she said yes sir I said you believe
[1:29:09] me she said with all of my heart and I
[1:29:12] told hold of her hand and I began to
[1:29:14] pray and it wouldn't leave her I said
[1:29:16] sister I don't understand why are you a
[1:29:17] Christian she said yes sir and a vision
[1:29:20] began to move yeah now remember the
[1:29:23] woman standing there and was told of
[1:29:26] living untrue to her marriage vows four
[1:29:28] days before that before the audience of
[1:29:31] 20,000 people over this was in Jonesboro
[1:29:35] Arkansas better listening and she
[1:29:37] started crying and The Man Behind her
[1:29:40] was her
[1:29:41] husband and he jerked her around and
[1:29:43] said what's
[1:29:45] this you see why I had to pray often he
[1:29:48] said what's this she said darling I'm
[1:29:50] sorry he said I just let myself loose
[1:29:54] and it moved over him and told him the
[1:29:57] same act he had with his bookkeeper
[1:29:59] right right and the car they were in and
[1:30:01] where they were at and he turned white
[1:30:04] and he said brother what must I do and
[1:30:06] he looked at her and he reached his hand
[1:30:08] out and said darling I've been a
[1:30:11] rra that's what he was amen I've been a
[1:30:15] wrapped said if you'll forgive me I'll
[1:30:17] forgive you and we'll start life a new
[1:30:19] right here before God's people and she
[1:30:22] said I forgive you and that little boy
[1:30:24] between them hug one another and knelt
[1:30:27] down there on the floor and give their
[1:30:29] hearts to God listen that's what happens
[1:30:32] when the anointed word is their PR it's
[1:30:36] deserting the hearts and lives of
[1:30:40] men right amen then they went and got
[1:30:43] baptized and was added into the church
[1:30:45] right so that's the way the Lord
[1:30:48] HS amen so
[1:30:50] forgiveness is a gift
[1:30:54] that not that you give others right but
[1:30:56] that you give
[1:30:58] yourself you're saying when you forgive
[1:31:00] someone I can't afford yeah to put this
[1:31:04] much energy yeah into being angry with
[1:31:06] you right I can't afford to every time
[1:31:10] you walk in the room I'm upset with you

[1:31:15] direction and I need to be put it into
[1:31:18] getting closer to God and encouraging
[1:31:20] other people so therefore I forgive you
