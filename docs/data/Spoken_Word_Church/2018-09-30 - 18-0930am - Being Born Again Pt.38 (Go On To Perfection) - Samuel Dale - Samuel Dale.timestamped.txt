[15:23] and godliness through the knowledge of
[15:25] him that have called us to glory and
[15:28] virtue are now where we call to we're
[15:31] called to total glorification in total
[15:34] part of in bringing the virtues into
[15:37] being we're by are given unto us
[15:40] exceeding great and precious promises
[15:42] that by these you might be partakers of

[15:52] diligence add to your faith virtue and

[16:01] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[16:04] brotherly kindness charity amen you may
[16:08] be seated the Lord having his blessing
[16:11] blessing upon the word
[16:14] now we've got some questions so if
[16:21] anything that you have a question or
[16:24] thought in your mind while we're trying
[16:26] to we'll review just a little to kind of
[16:28] line up things and then we have a few
[16:30] questions to try to cover upon what
[16:34] we've been speaking on right now and if
[16:39] you have anything just just raise your
[16:41] hand one of the Deacons or somebody will
[16:43] come and get it and write it down and
[16:45] just say what do you mean that's all
[16:47] right with me I don't have to have a
[16:49] whole lot of doing I just have a weak
[16:52] mind anyway so I can only handle parts
[16:54] of it so you know just speak whatever
[16:58] you say and you say this what do you
[17:00] mean by this and I'll try to explain it
[17:02] right now we know for a surety we've
[17:05] been teaching the message of the stature
[17:08] of a perfect man all right and then that
[17:12] statue of a perfect man is the most
[17:14] wonderful situation that could ever be
[17:19] thought of in mankind see we as the
[17:24] people of the the end time we had our
[17:28] own ideas and thoughts and and stuff
[17:31] like that and we basically just you know
[17:33] we're close to a Baptist thought that
[17:36] you get everything when you believe and
[17:38] that's the way most people think you
[17:39] know think what do you get borned again
[17:41] and when you get born again you just got
[17:43] everything well that's not true you have
[17:48] a wonderful start you have a great
[17:50] blessings but when a baby is naturally
[17:53] born into the world it has all of the
[17:57] parts and things outside of some
[17:59] abnormality growing you know everything
[18:02] is dire but it's not into development to
[18:05] where it can be used properly you know
[18:09] as we say you don't you don't give you
[18:11] five year old or three year old or eight
[18:13] year old or 16 year old the key to the
[18:18] car you know you kind of keep it a
[18:20] little more reserved to make sure you
[18:25] know that you don't want them to running
[18:27] all over the place
[18:28] and messing up everything alright but
[18:30] yet still we believe in a growth
[18:32] development alright and that's what
[18:34] we've been teaching of the statue of a
[18:36] perfect man and I believe that's what
[18:37] Peter is explaining there in Chapter one
[18:42] as we kept reading see being born again
[18:44] and it's by the Word of God and that is
[18:48] the new birth all right so when the
[18:50] Prophet says statue of a perfect man he
[18:53] said how faith and be born again all
[18:56] right but now that doesn't give you
[18:58] everything because that's where he told
[18:59] the Pentecostal people well he said
[19:01] that's where you made your mistake
[19:03] he said you thought you got everything
[19:06] but said you only come to the point of
[19:09] getting the new birth or into the body
[19:11] of Christ and amen for getting into the
[19:14] body of Christ amen for the new birth
[19:16] because it is the the birth of the word
[19:19] it is eternal life in your soul all
[19:22] right that's wonderful and we thank God
[19:25] for that right but it's not the finished
[19:28] product there's a lot in the word is
[19:31] this keeping on going see and and as
[19:34] Peter says in first Peter being born
[19:37] again means something going on in a
[19:39] process that is within your life all
[19:42] right and then we get an over to second
[19:45] Peter he's explaining how that takes
[19:47] place and he says the Prophet says
[19:50] you're born again at faith he said
[19:53] that's the new birth faith in God he
[19:57] said everything we get is based upon
[19:58] faith
[19:59] all right the foundation of all things
[20:01] is faith faith is the beginning of our
[20:05] experience that is the beginning of our
[20:07] new birth the faith that we receive all
[20:11] right then Peter says to add to that
[20:15] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[20:18] patience godliness and all and it comes
[20:21] out to build in the stature of a perfect
[20:24] man and I've tried to explain that for
[20:27] 50 almost 50 years to you because that's
[20:31] what I believe that we must grow into
[20:35] these things and it's in the statute of
[20:37] perfect Manny's brother Brennan said the
[20:38] church that has these things is what's
[20:40] going in the rapture
[20:41] these verses he said any individual that
[20:45] has these things is what's going in the
[20:47] rapture all right
[20:48] you said well what about some of those
[20:50] down through time who didn't receive it
[20:51] don't worry about that if they're truly
[20:53] born again they're in the body of Christ
[20:55] that's the key to the whole thing all
[20:58] right but they without us Hebrews 11 40
[21:00] says they're waiting on you and I to
[21:03] bring them bring it to a place of a
[21:05] change of the body because this is the
[21:07] end time and this is for you and I all
[21:10] right see then God sent us a message to
[21:16] were that we could understand these
[21:18] things they took the Prophet he said
[21:21] statue of perfect man he said 30 years
[21:22] to preach that Allah he was trying to
[21:26] bring it you can go back in the early
[21:28] ministries and hear him talk about
[21:29] growth development adoption Jiri him the
[21:35] many different avenues that are reached
[21:38] to try to describe the statue of a
[21:41] perfect man or the growth of a Christian
[21:43] in Christ all right and see then what
[21:47] we've we've laid it over and over
[21:49] together but run said Paul and Peter
[21:52] preached the same thing
[21:54] all right now so then Paul doesn't use
[21:59] 2nd Peter he doesn't talk about add to
[22:02] your faith virtue no he doesn't cool
[22:05] that away but he goes with the adoption
[22:07] or form incurring it into showing
[22:11] adoption as were you adopt God adopts
[22:14] his own children see we in the natural
[22:18] you you adopt your own children that's
[22:20] that's not the days of now adoption so
[22:23] much but you adopt your own children
[22:25] after they reach an age of a kind of an
[22:28] age of of to where they can that big old
[22:31] bar that I miss but that words are
[22:36] you know for showing that they've
[22:37] reached a dull adulthood and in that
[22:41] they can be adopted or trusted and given
[22:45] the things to wear that they can be
[22:47] trusted you know and it was wonderful to
[22:51] be there in Israel when we actually got
[22:54] to view one of those
[22:55] outside on one of the corners that we
[22:59] were standing on kind of waiting on
[23:01] something else and we got to view that
[23:03] you know and it's wonderful all right
[23:06] let's see didn't we believe that the new
[23:08] birth brings you the eternal life but it
[23:11] doesn't finish the journey that's why
[23:13] Peter says being born again something's
[23:16] going on in our lives and they took the
[23:19] prophets message to bring that we
[23:22] believe the disciples were bringing
[23:24] these things as I said Peter preaching
[23:26] the statute of perfect man Paul
[23:28] preaching adoption all of it
[23:29] interrelates together to show the growth
[23:32] development of a Christian and bringing
[23:35] us to the place to word that we'll
[23:37] eventually somebody's going to come to a
[23:39] change of the body and you go through
[23:42] the book of Romans 8 then you get that
[23:44] word that you can cover that you're born
[23:47] again you know and making us children of
[23:50] God then waiting for the manifestation
[23:51] of the sons and daughters of God to come
[23:54] forth all right then you come down to
[23:57] the last part in in Romans where it's
[23:59] all about to wit to understand the
[24:03] redemption of the body this age is to
[24:06] come to those things all right
[24:07] we've tried to bring those things out
[24:09] into an open to where we can follow what
[24:13] the Prophet is bringing unto us and he
[24:17] says that without these virtues you can
[24:24] become just a stumbling block with your
[24:26] gifts and your doing and stuff like that
[24:29] can be this a stumbling block a statue
[24:32] of a perfect man they because it if it's
[24:35] not handled correctly gifts can become
[24:39] damaging to you because you use them
[24:42] wrong all right so we we want to growth
[24:46] development and as I said we want the
[24:48] part of work that these bodies are to be
[24:51] changed what is the last thing there's
[24:55] only one thing to be brought in the last
[24:57] days and that's the change of these
[24:58] bodies right because everything else is
[25:02] into manifestation all right everything
[25:06] else has been brought forth but we get
[25:08] to read
[25:09] some of these bodies all right now in
[25:11] that sea then we come to studying the
[25:15] message as to seeing that it's laying
[25:19] there right in the message the things
[25:22] that you and I have need of all right
[25:25] it's in the stature of a perfect man
[25:28] because it shows that you go from fake
[25:31] to virture to knowledge temperance
[25:32] patience see and then you drop right on
[25:35] over in the scripture and you get up you
[25:37] know work speaks of the fruits of the
[25:39] spirit is love joy peace goodness
[25:41] meekness etc those are the things just
[25:45] in other word ins has to be used of a
[25:48] statue of a perfect man like I said the
[25:51] Prophet said he was thirty something
[25:52] years and preaching that no he said I've
[25:56] tried to have patience with the Branham
[25:58] tavern I call he said because that's
[26:01] where he's you know he was trying to
[26:03] bring that to us because he that was
[26:05] what was lost you can credit the statue
[26:09] of a perfect man or the growth
[26:11] development pretty well over to about
[26:13] the fourth church age all right because
[26:17] you got your your Martin and Columba and
[26:20] all of those coming in that was teaching
[26:22] the correct way so you can follow the
[26:25] statue of a perfect man or the growth
[26:26] development up to about the fourth
[26:29] church age all right but then it died
[26:31] went into the ground it was not the
[26:34] Spirit of God that went into the ground
[26:36] it was the growth development or
[26:39] understanding of the word of God that
[26:42] was taken away see they begin to
[26:43] denominator begin to die and fall away
[26:45] as they did then Luther comes forth with
[26:48] his just shall live by faith
[26:50] Wesley sanctification then Pentecostals
[26:54] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:55] but that only brings you back to the
[26:57] position the word that you can start the
[27:00] growth development you know like weights
[27:03] bringing out in the seals and the thing
[27:05] see you've got Reformation down to a lot
[27:07] of that because it's reform and we won't
[27:10] get there this afternoon but I mean this
[27:13] morning but we'll we'll try to bring it
[27:15] on out later I'm talking about carnal
[27:18] reform alright but you see I'm just
[27:21] giving you a Feist run
[27:23] then back up to the questions all right
[27:25] that the new birth gives us eternal life
[27:30] but it's not finished no more than a
[27:34] baby's finished when it's born it has
[27:37] the growth development you must feed it
[27:39] and okay so we must take in the word and
[27:42] let the word come out the disciples now
[27:46] they heard the word for three and a half
[27:49] years they were taught the Word of God
[27:52] for three and a half years they actually
[27:56] heard Jesus in Matthew 24
[27:58] as he spoke of the seals didn't
[28:02] understand it but they heard it they
[28:05] heard the teachings of the Lord Jesus
[28:07] all right they got on over to John we're
[28:13] even after the resurrection of the Lord
[28:15] Jesus and he breathed on them and said
[28:18] receive ye the Holy Ghost they still
[28:21] didn't get it right to her brother run
[28:23] said that was a promise to come on to
[28:25] their penticoff now that's questions and
[28:27] answers we can give you these quotes
[28:28] because they didn't get the Holy Ghost
[28:31] go Jesus Christ had not come back he was
[28:35] there with them you know at the
[28:37] resurrection and the things and open to
[28:39] it and he opened even in the Book of
[28:42] Luke there's two times that he opened
[28:44] their understanding of the Scriptures so
[28:47] my point of what I'm getting at those
[28:49] disciples had three and a half years of
[28:51] tutoring and training and all and could
[28:55] question the Lord Jesus and did about
[28:58] what he was saying and what he was
[29:00] teaching and when they were born again
[29:03] they were born again in a great position
[29:06] because they were born as newborn babes
[29:09] in Christ yeah but that christ
[29:11] development because of the opening of
[29:13] the word placed them positionally in the
[29:17] body of christ but Aaron said the
[29:19] disciples had these virtues but they did
[29:23] now the headstone no that's what he says
[29:25] so we're not gonna argue and nobody
[29:28] about it was just quoting what he said
[29:29] he said they didn't have the headstone
[29:31] coat it hadn't come yet all right see it
[29:34] was to come in the in town and that's
[29:35] where we get to
[29:36] where we're at here in the lives all
[29:38] right we see the disciples they heard
[29:41] the word and when the Holy Ghost fell in
[29:44] the Upper Room there was only 120 and
[29:48] I've always said to you the Bible says
[29:49] he was seen of what were 500 brethren I
[29:52] have through his resurrection where's
[29:53] the rest of them they didn't fit the
[29:57] bill right they wasn't capable of going
[29:59] to the upper room well because they
[30:04] hadn't been tutored and trained or
[30:05] something was wrong and yet after even
[30:08] seeing him I through his resurrection
[30:10] they never thought it worthy to go to
[30:13] the upper room but 121 all right but
[30:17] then they come out from the upper room
[30:19] and when they do Peter preaches a
[30:22] message there in acts 2 to try to show
[30:26] those people what has taken place this
[30:29] is that that was spoken off all right
[30:32] and when it does then the Holy Ghost
[30:34] falls on 3,000 all right but remember
[30:38] that 3,000 had just heard one sermon all
[30:43] right so you can't say they were born as
[30:46] the others were because they never had
[30:50] to the opening of the word but they did
[30:53] receive the new birth and it made them
[30:56] babes in Christ desiring the sincere
[31:00] milk of the word that they may grow
[31:01] thereby made of newborn babies but it
[31:05] made them babies that needed to grope
[31:06] development then Peter writes our
[31:09] teachers here in his message how for
[31:13] them to come to her 120 we'd say was
[31:16] this a growth development because they
[31:19] knew how to teach it you don't you know
[31:21] novice don't write the word then you
[31:25] don't do that you don't put a novice out
[31:26] to write the word you put one that's do
[31:29] it and that's what I've always tried to
[31:31] get you to see Adam and Eve wouldn't
[31:34] babies and grow it up so when the church
[31:39] started on the day of Pentecost it
[31:41] started with them in full-grown not
[31:43] babies
[31:44] but they were to teach others how to get
[31:46] to where they were that's the main thing
[31:49] what
[31:50] profit come to do them God opened the
[31:53] word to the profit showed him what was
[31:55] missing
[31:57] Luther nominate Luther taught the new
[32:00] birth
[32:01] Wesley taught the new birth may have
[32:05] just been in may have been parts or
[32:06] whatever you call or something but it
[32:08] was still taught Azusa Street talked the
[32:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:13] but then the Prophet came to restore
[32:16] what would be called the faith of the
[32:18] fathers the faith of the fathers is a
[32:21] revelation of the father so it took him
[32:24] 30 something years to be able to preach
[32:28] the faith of the fathers yet we think oh
[32:32] we got it all and brother Brown said our
[32:36] problem is why too many one full vessels
[32:46] come on you need the quote he said not a
[32:50] lot of empty vessels too many full
[32:53] vessels see what I got it all I got it
[32:56] all yeah yeah so you can't teach me cuz
[33:01] I got it out I got it where'd you get it
[33:03] that's as plain as I can say where'd you
[33:06] get it see the Prophet came then to
[33:08] restore the faith of the father's right
[33:11] was that his message to turn arts of the
[33:14] children back to the faith of the
[33:17] father's all right bring in the
[33:20] revelation of these things as I said a
[33:23] minute ago he told the Pentecostal he
[33:25] said that's where you made you mistake
[33:26] thinking you had everything he said you
[33:29] say ladder a ladder a ladder right he
[33:31] said you had to form a reign yet what
[33:37] was the former run his message of the
[33:40] teaching of the statue of a perfect land
[33:42] to try to turn us back to the faith of
[33:44] the fathers is the former rain latter
[33:48] rain is harvest rain are quickening to
[33:51] show that he taught it correctly God
[33:54] carries him on through the opening of
[33:56] the word into the seals that Jesus
[33:59] preached in Matthew 24 but no one knew
[34:02] anything about
[34:04] see he goes on and it proved that he did
[34:07] have those things like the disciples had
[34:10] got one because the Bible said were
[34:12] built on the foundation of the apostles
[34:15] and prophets Jesus Christ being the
[34:18] chief Cornerstone
[34:19] so we're built upon what the Apostles
[34:21] taught and see they never had no false
[34:25] doctrine or idea they were true prophets
[34:29] true prophets as I quoted I'm in the
[34:32] Goethe prophecy true prophets bring
[34:34] troopers false prophets bring folks
[34:36] birth so you see that's where the
[34:40] troubles that you see what's taking
[34:41] place now you see where that all is
[34:44] these that followed the message so long
[34:46] stayed with it
[34:47] hollered and screamed about it brought a
[34:49] lot of us in to the message were the
[34:52] ones God used to do that thank God for
[34:55] them but now they're out there running
[34:57] on the field well brother Brown was
[34:58] wrong here he's wrong here he was wrong
[35:00] though well if you can tell me brother
[35:02] Brown was wrong and short to me I need
[35:04] to follow you that's sensible I mean if
[35:08] you show me some of these brothers that
[35:10] can straighten brother branham out then
[35:12] we need to follow that I mean that's
[35:16] sensible but you ain't gonna find it
[35:19] oh you're gonna find a bunch of garbage
[35:21] cans that's swore by these things you
[35:26] know spent their whole life studying the
[35:29] message we were there now evidently they
[35:35] missed the statue of a perfect man this
[35:38] is truthful that I can say because by
[35:40] missing the statue of a perfect man the
[35:43] statue of a perfect man did how none of
[35:45] those doctors they wouldn't know two
[35:48] souls two Lords fought this out of the
[35:50] other no Holy Ghost doctor and you know
[35:52] River Jordans on they wouldn't know that
[35:54] in the Bible
[35:59] none of that's in there the true
[36:01] understanding is in of the one God the
[36:04] water baptism - no eternal hell's that
[36:06] the truth of the end was in the Bible
[36:11] waiting own to be brought by the Prophet
[36:13] - were that it would open the word of
[36:16] God to us to where we could study the
[36:20] message and see what we have need of
[36:25] instead of defaulting like I said he
[36:28] said these virtually the gifts without
[36:30] these virtues is a stumbling block
[36:33] stumble excuse me use the word stumble
[36:36] block if you're looking for stumbling
[36:38] you won't find it in your computer it's
[36:40] stumble block yeah but it's the same
[36:43] thing you'll saying it all right now
[36:45] listen to do that then we see that we
[36:49] need or we must have these things it's a
[36:51] requirement it's not a just that well
[36:54] maybe we need this maybe when he died he
[36:57] said the person with this the church
[36:58] with this would be the one that was
[37:00] going around
[37:00] he said the individual with these verses
[37:03] would be the one that would go in the
[37:05] rapture well the rapture is dependent
[37:08] upon this message being correct so when
[37:16] we believe that will so there's a lot of
[37:18] the people that smash it all in the
[37:20] screen that they believe it where are
[37:22] they now see it's not to just say the
[37:25] message is right it's whether or not the
[37:27] message is revealed to you whether or
[37:32] not it's revealed to me and you we want
[37:35] to worry about the message being right
[37:37] that ain't our Park our trouble our
[37:40] thoughts as to whether or not we believe
[37:45] the message still to be true and as I
[37:48] said what about those what about the
[37:51] preachers of this message they some of
[37:53] them for 40 years preach this message
[37:55] and now they're saying the Prophet was
[37:58] wrong didn't that something he said well
[38:03] I'll never fall for that you know what
[38:04] they said they'd never fall for that
[38:08] just remember only by the grace of God
[38:13] we'll keep you and I from falling for
[38:17] that right only the grace of God will
[38:21] keep us well I studied the message was
[38:24] so how they so as a lot of people
[38:28] studied this message
[38:30] that's what's going to make it so
[38:31] damaging when they do have to come
[38:34] through a judgment the day you know well
[38:37] are you trying to call it normally call
[38:38] down judgment what I call her own
[38:39] judgment I don't have anything to do
[38:41] we're calling you in the judgment you
[38:43] call yourself into judgment all right
[38:46] but you understand what I'm saying now
[38:48] see that's the point of the whole thing
[38:50] is to know that this message come to do
[38:54] what it was to do and has been delivered
[38:57] into our hands now for us to make it
[39:00] manifest for the profit to bring it
[39:04] thank God
[39:04] praise God we got it all right but that
[39:07] don't mean we have it it's when it's
[39:12] revealed to you and me and not just
[39:15] revealed to us but when it's made
[39:17] manifest through our hearts and our
[39:19] lives to these things we found a lot of
[39:23] things in the statue of a perfect man
[39:25] that were parts that were hard to follow
[39:29] sometimes you know like why would the
[39:33] Prophet say virtue
[39:35] he said now that's not just living a
[39:37] virgin life well he agreed with the
[39:42] virgin life but that was not what Peter
[39:45] was talking about I spent and I want to
[39:48] emphasize that and then we'll get to a
[39:49] question see we've got to take this is
[39:52] the point I've tried to make to you
[39:54] we've got to take what the Prophet said
[40:00] not what the natural words say the
[40:04] natural word of virtue means a virgin
[40:08] life you know physical virgin life all
[40:13] right
[40:13] but that that's not what he's talking
[40:16] about there the Prophet said he said not
[40:19] in this case
[40:20] if you read the statute for a man if you
[40:22] hadn't go on read it you'll find these
[40:25] statements I see a virgin life is to be
[40:30] a virtuous person of all things like I
[40:34] tried to cover it you can be a pure
[40:36] virgin man our woman because man has a
[40:39] virginity just as a woman does we don't
[40:41] teach that a lot the message but it's
[40:43] dire
[40:44] but see it's a virtuous life more than
[40:52] just a virgin you'd be a virgin of these
[40:54] meanings violence night what are the
[40:56] name Bonnie or Clyde what was her name
[40:58] Bonnie was he the one I never didn't
[41:00] know which was the man which was wrong
[41:01] she could have been a pure virgin I'm
[41:04] just killing anybody dropping that
[41:05] doesn't matter to her see that's not
[41:08] that's why it's not just to say certain
[41:10] words it's to take the way the Prophet
[41:13] brought that word then when you get on
[41:17] over to what we got on over to
[41:18] temperance this is showing a couple of
[41:21] things when you get the temperance when
[41:23] it's say the Prophet said that don't
[41:24] mean now I'm not drinking alcohol we'll
[41:27] see the natural word temperance means to
[41:30] not drink alcohol but he said not in
[41:32] this case he said it's the controlling
[41:36] of that temper and one hour I could part
[41:39] out of course I didn't like it cause it
[41:41] hits me when he said with that
[41:43] controlling that tongue temperance is
[41:48] talking about controlling the tongue you
[41:53] know what I don't want no problems like
[41:54] I said brother Jack Cole said and that
[41:56] lady said she wanted to lay her tongue
[41:58] on the altar he said this Pope it's only
[42:01] 14 feet
[42:02] man they I may in another room up here
[42:04] for your tongue what well I don't have
[42:08] no problem with my tongue what I do and
[42:11] I'm just gonna tell you you do too so
[42:13] that's tough we're gonna solve that
[42:14] problem you ain't lying the mean ain't
[42:16] lying to you we just be walking and try
[42:19] to pray I'm glad we've got in a coma
[42:21] that's the main thing is we got an
[42:24] atonement for taking care of an advocate
[42:26] all right now if we didn't have trouble
[42:28] why would we need an advocate if we've
[42:32] got everything sealed up package deal
[42:34] when we got born again why do we need an
[42:37] advocate why do we need being born again
[42:42] okay all right now to get to the point
[42:45] the end of this show that was kind of
[42:46] the lineup the color I don't want you to
[42:49] misunderstand me when I come through and
[42:51] and just drop in the message to try to
[42:53] pick up some questions and like I said
[42:56] if you've got a question let me know
[42:58] all right yeah this is question number
[43:02] one that wrote and said was they had two
[43:04] questions about what I've been preaching
[43:08] brother Branham said now remember the
[43:11] background or the statue of a perfect
[43:13] man he goes he doesn't tell the dream of
[43:17] sister Shepherd on the statue of a
[43:19] perfect man with some little time later
[43:24] he preached after preaching the statue
[43:27] of a perfect man
[43:28] sister Shepherds remembers her dream and
[43:31] she writes brother Branham her dream all
[43:36] right and that's in blasphemous names
[43:37] and he he takes her dream and it
[43:41] explains the stature of a perfect man
[43:43] from her dream all right and doing it
[43:47] from her dream see then he was
[43:50] expressing what was taking place as I
[43:52] said a minute ago we take words for what
[43:57] we want it to be or whatever the
[43:59] definition Webster gives that can't
[44:02] always be true you'd read in Webster may
[44:10] be born again would be this out of the
[44:12] other the Peter says being born again
[44:14] see we go to the Prophet to get the
[44:18] answer all right that's the only way you
[44:21] can answer any question is by way of the
[44:24] prophets message let him answer it all
[44:29] right I see you as I said and people
[44:32] don't follow me on what I try to say but
[44:35] even like the Bible the Bible the King
[44:40] James Version we have is a translation
[44:42] of translations there's a lot of your
[44:45] good news for modern men and different
[44:47] one that actually used more original
[44:50] background of the Greeks in the Hebrews
[44:54] than think then actually because the
[44:57] King James Version is not a translation
[45:01] they don't any any translator it doesn't
[45:04] matter what it is they don't translate
[45:07] by what they think at least they're not
[45:10] supposed to
[45:11] now you know what I'm saying about that
[45:14] because you get into good news for
[45:15] modern men different time they translate
[45:17] by what they think but that's not the
[45:19] way it's supposed to be a true
[45:21] translator is supposed to translate word
[45:23] for word they're not supposed to think
[45:28] out what they're doing they're supposed
[45:30] to translate that's why I like the King
[45:31] James he took so many different ones
[45:35] sixteen I think numbers may be awful
[45:38] he takes groups they did they took
[45:41] groups and they put them all in
[45:43] different rooms and as they did they
[45:46] gave them so many of writings and things
[45:49] and they told him said go in there and
[45:52] come out with something that all y'all
[45:55] can agree then they took them and
[45:59] compared them with each other with this
[46:03] group with this group in this group
[46:04] until they got it tour all the groups
[46:07] were bringing the same thing they didn't
[46:09] write it down as being from God
[46:11] that's why so translation out
[46:13] translations they took all of the
[46:16] translations put them out to him and
[46:18] gave it to him they take a check all of
[46:20] their doctrine went and they came out
[46:22] with what we call the King James alright
[46:24] I believe it's the right one now like
[46:28] I've told you the reason I do because it
[46:31] was one the Prophet used right it was
[46:36] the one he used now he read other
[46:39] translations right that's fine you know
[46:43] cuz he even said the lumps of
[46:45] translation is the closest could be now
[46:48] I'm honest to admit there's some things
[46:49] I can't put it exactly in the lungs that
[46:53] comes forth in the King James but that's
[46:55] alright I'm not arguing with him he's
[46:57] one said it was that's my understanding
[46:59] that's where I mess it up that's where
[47:02] I'm trying to translate it okay oh but I
[47:07] don't translate yeah just remember your
[47:13] mouth doesn't open and speak words
[47:18] unless your brain has said something
[47:22] so your brain this first it's gonna tell
[47:27] you what it's safe from you lives all
[47:29] right now so we get the point now see
[47:34] then we asked the Prophet what does this
[47:38] mean and he'd say so-and-so so-and-so
[47:42] all right we got to take what he says to
[47:46] be the answer to that all right let's
[47:47] think about it that said they said well
[47:50] we've had two questions said brother
[47:52] Branham said about the sister shepherds
[47:54] in the dream you know that she was a
[47:59] charitable person he said she opened her
[48:04] house two bums beggars and fed them he
[48:08] then said God accepted her foundation
[48:11] now I'm reading what they say now so she
[48:14] showed she had brotherly kindness is
[48:16] that why God accepted her foundation all
[48:22] right now remember first prophet what
[48:26] was the foundation that was accepted not
[48:33] her brotherly kindness that's enough
[48:36] paragraph 137 blasphemous names faith is
[48:41] the foundation of all things and brother
[48:47] Brennan says God accepted her foundation
[48:51] he accepted her faith her faith is her
[48:56] foundation he accepted her faith not her
[48:59] brotherly kindness that would have been
[49:01] in there because it's displaying you're
[49:03] seeing that but I'm just answering the
[49:05] question as the question is written me
[49:08] in other words did he accept her brother
[49:11] did he accept her her brother the
[49:14] kindness no see she may not have had the
[49:16] true meaning of brotherly kindness even
[49:18] though she was a great person
[49:20] wonderful do it a lot in their life all
[49:25] right
[49:26] but he accepted her foundation which was
[49:30] her faith her new birth right he
[49:35] accepted her
[49:35] new birth her foundation which was her
[49:39] faith a revelation of God so then the
[49:43] Prophet answered it that the foundation
[49:46] was her faith that was accepted then you
[49:50] go virtue or knowledge temperance
[49:51] patience then you keep climbing all
[49:54] right because we haven't really got in
[49:56] to a lot of brotherly kindness yet all
[50:00] right number two says you often quote
[50:05] brother Branham where he said that God
[50:09] wants to fill ever fiber of his church
[50:15] now here's the question apart
[50:17] it's come which I do I quote that a lot
[50:20] what brother Brennan said God wants to
[50:21] fill every fiber of our being in take us
[50:24] in the rapture all right yeah now is
[50:29] that the same as what your you talked
[50:33] about this morning 9:23 18 when you
[50:38] mentioned that the honey seals the whole
[50:41] pyramid as the headstone comes down all
[50:45] right now when the Prophet is saying
[50:49] that God wants to fill every fiber of
[50:51] our being that is the whole complete
[50:54] unit you know us as a unit all right
[50:59] that would mean everything it would mean
[51:01] the headstone would be present all right
[51:04] and see when you're coming up to to
[51:08] seeing brotherly kindness and and things
[51:11] like that being we taught it as the
[51:14] Prophet taught it on the blasphemous
[51:16] names
[51:17] all right What did he say he said the
[51:19] Holy Ghost
[51:20] remember the messenger was pouring the
[51:23] message in he said it boiled out all the
[51:26] trash but he said it run out he's going
[51:29] to had cracks in it he said then the
[51:31] messenger took honey and poured it into
[51:35] the rock box which I don't draw it here
[51:38] to be the eye but you'd have to put a
[51:40] little kind of a lip around or a flange
[51:43] as he called it you know - worth it when
[51:46] the honey was poured in its sealed
[51:50] and the honey is the seal of God the
[51:55] baptism when the Holy Ghost is your seal
[51:57] since why it's so hard when you try to
[52:00] express something if you don't express
[52:02] it in line people get the wrong idea the
[52:06] new birth is the seal of God the baptism
[52:10] of the Holy Ghost the new birth you
[52:12] receive that is the seal of God that
[52:14] seals you in all right within there's
[52:19] more to it because as each virtue is
[52:22] given unto you then God seals that
[52:25] virtue into you that's the part of your
[52:29] new birth so then you have the Prophet
[52:32] said he says you burped into this and
[52:35] this into this and then then how many
[52:37] births do we have brother Dale you have
[52:38] one new birth you have one new birth but
[52:43] there's many births just as it is in the
[52:46] Bible they had one filling of the Holy
[52:49] Ghost on the day of Pentecost
[52:51] but then the disciples met daily and
[52:55] different times and the Bible says that
[52:56] that Holy Ghost was our filling them new
[53:00] the new birth is the birth of the word
[53:03] but then you're being born again as that
[53:06] word that you receive all right so then
[53:10] as you receive it what are you doing all
[53:13] the way up when to the basis - were when
[53:16] they had unites with the body and I say
[53:19] that we're all respect because of what I
[53:22] believe the knew were I mean the
[53:23] headstone is because I believe it's the
[53:26] revealed word and if you can make
[53:28] anything else I'd like to see it because
[53:31] anything you'd say well that's this is
[53:34] that I won't say it's the birth of the
[53:35] word because that's what it's got to be
[53:38] a subversive the word let's see when God
[53:41] gives you faith which is the new birth
[53:45] then when he gives you virtue that
[53:49] actually is sealed within you knowledge
[53:53] is sealed within you the garden as' then
[53:58] brotherly kindness comes in the
[54:00] shoulders all right at that place
[54:02] the comments just runs out and seals the
[54:05] whole thing so you look we're brother
[54:07] kindness is even it comes right here and
[54:11] it's true baptism of the Holy Ghost this
[54:14] seals all of this all of it sealed in
[54:18] alright because that's part of it so
[54:21] then when it when the Holy Ghost comes
[54:23] down upon the body the sealing of the
[54:27] pyramid knee which will be the new birth
[54:31] finished that's why I always teach you
[54:34] that way I believe it the day we leave
[54:37] this world in a rapture you know what
[54:42] you can say I am born again I'm truly
[54:48] born again when we walk out of this
[54:51] world in a rapture why cause it'll prove
[54:55] it like I said about it do you think see
[54:59] there's people that teach brother
[55:00] Branham was wrong here oh he was wrong
[55:03] in his early ministry and right in his
[55:05] last day you showed me that in the Bible
[55:07] or show me that in the prophets message
[55:09] I put it out there let him come to you
[55:12] come to me contact me about it you can't
[55:16] do it cuz if he didn't have it right God
[55:19] ain't gonna do the rest right if he
[55:25] didn't have it right
[55:26] who's going correct him well we found
[55:30] him wrong here we found him wrong
[55:31] thought we found him yeah just remember
[55:37] the Prophet was the prophet of the age
[55:41] not me and you the message that he
[55:46] brought us that's why I was saying the
[55:48] way I did like he says on blasphemous
[55:50] night that sister in her dream she saw
[55:55] the pyramid and saw the thing and she
[55:58] saw somebody with water pouring it in
[56:01] the top which would have been up here
[56:04] you know right in here pouring it in and
[56:09] it run down bought out all the tribes
[56:12] the faith of the fathers that are trying
[56:15] to teach you the other day
[56:16] the faith of the fathers or to board out
[56:18] a lot of our tribes the new birth before
[56:21] we heard of the faith of the father's
[56:23] order took care of a lot of things I
[56:28] mean come on I come out of the Baptist
[56:30] Church I come out of a church in the
[56:34] Baptist Church that they wouldn't have a
[56:36] preacher married twice they had that
[56:40] much respect for the Word of God I
[56:46] didn't have to get born again to learn
[56:48] not to let the neighbors cow out that's
[56:53] what everybody thanks brother branham
[56:54] come to tell us what does he need to
[56:56] come tell
[56:57] hey come on sisters you didn't need this
[57:00] message to tell you it's wrong to cut
[57:02] your hair the Bible says it you didn't
[57:09] need to prophets message to do those
[57:11] things yeah we put it all on that
[57:12] because we want to make excuses don't
[57:16] make excuses with me they don't work
[57:18] face straight up there was a lot in our
[57:23] lives should have been taken care of
[57:25] before we ever heard of this message we
[57:31] were already in the Baptist Church not
[57:35] allowing our children to watch certain
[57:37] programs on TV what was in the Baptist
[57:42] Church
[57:46] we didn't take vacations to go somewhere
[57:50] and be gone from the church we was gonna
[57:54] go to church somewhere so you can use
[57:57] excuses for this that Elsa you say you
[57:59] throw at me no no we've got ways of
[58:02] taking care of things now we can do the
[58:04] best we can now I against taking
[58:06] vacations nobody see that's where you
[58:08] start saying things people only don't
[58:10] believe me they don't believe well you
[58:11] go ahead and do what you want to do but
[58:14] listen
[58:17] the question was in other words was that
[58:22] honey to fill every fiber it will be the
[58:25] honey cause the baptism when the Holy
[58:27] Ghost the new birth the simple new birth
[58:32] that you receive that is the baptism in
[58:35] the Holy Ghost then you cover the
[58:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost as these ended
[58:41] as each individual virtue being birthed
[58:43] into you nurse the baptism
[58:48] that's why brother Brandon what was a
[58:49] blasphemous night he said the baptism of
[58:52] the Holy Ghost has been so missed alt or
[58:55] incorrectly called as he said well
[58:59] because you just teaching it anything
[59:01] see then as it keeps coming down there
[59:04] will be a time when God will steal in
[59:08] his bride and there will be a group in
[59:13] the last days as it's never been before
[59:16] but there will be a group to be sealed
[59:19] in and then they'll walk off the earth
[59:23] group it will be a bride around the
[59:27] world won't be just Loula it would be a
[59:31] bride around the world
[59:34] that'll come to the place in the Word of
[59:36] God Wow
[59:38] see that's why it's so important then
[59:40] what we hear when the body is complete
[59:44] now this is my statement back when the
[59:48] body is complete finishing out with all
[59:52] of the virtues in the thing and the
[59:54] headstone coming to unite then you'll
[1:00:00] say every fiber of my being
[1:00:02] let's see how they brought around said
[1:00:04] he said they'll come suture on baptism
[1:00:06] of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:08] I'm perforated it he said they'll come
[1:00:10] such a baptism when the Holy Ghost
[1:00:12] they don't feel every fiber of our being
[1:00:14] you take us in the rapture I believe
[1:00:16] that's about as close as you'll get to
[1:00:18] it because that's what it'll do you said
[1:00:20] well you're looking for a baptism an old
[1:00:22] ago I look for one every day
[1:00:24] I enjoy the presence of God everyday
[1:00:26] what about you
[1:00:27] I mean anytime that I can feel his
[1:00:31] presence I'm certainly believing that's
[1:00:34] a good baptism I like that because I
[1:00:38] believe in many baptisms I believe in
[1:00:42] being born again which his own going on
[1:00:45] going on going on going yeah not just
[1:00:48] one thing well I'm satisfied one well
[1:00:52] that's all right I'm not my belly sticks
[1:00:55] out and rub the pulpit because I'm not
[1:00:57] satisfied with just eating a little bit
[1:00:59] I like to eat a whole lot and I like
[1:01:04] that in the Word of God I enjoy hearing
[1:01:07] the Word of God to wear that this keeps
[1:01:10] unfolding and bringing me to deeper
[1:01:14] thoughts because that's what it's
[1:01:17] supposed to be all right so then it will
[1:01:20] come a day that something will happen
[1:01:28] that when this message is completely
[1:01:31] sewn down around the world then there
[1:01:34] will be an anointing strike now quote
[1:01:38] the Prophet after the door of the
[1:01:40] Gentile church is closed God will
[1:01:43] unknown a church he said he'll do in one
[1:01:46] year what he did in 2000 tried to do but
[1:01:50] even though this is what I see that's
[1:01:52] where people don't want to he said but
[1:01:54] he's doing it now you realize every time
[1:01:57] that God reveals itself to you that he's
[1:02:01] letting you know how much he loves you
[1:02:03] that he's sealing you with his love that
[1:02:08] brotherly katrina said we ain't got far
[1:02:10] enough yet and brotherly kind that's
[1:02:12] where the brotherly kindness comes in
[1:02:13] door he just seals it in and that honey
[1:02:16] just seals the whole thing you don't
[1:02:22] love the presence of God I love it
[1:02:27] because it's wonderful okay all right
[1:02:31] then we got that one let's see we get on
[1:02:34] this other one
[1:02:36] okay now this other one because I don't
[1:02:40] mind it I enjoy a lot of times people
[1:02:43] like this one over here I mean they're
[1:02:46] they're stating what they think you're
[1:02:47] saying that's good I'm just making sure
[1:02:51] this like I said about the god accepted
[1:02:53] her foundation now he accepted her new
[1:02:55] burrows maybe he didn't accept her
[1:02:58] brotherly kindness because maybe she
[1:03:00] didn't have it yet she was a good person
[1:03:02] that's what we think brotherly kindness
[1:03:05] is being good thing
[1:03:08] that's just like virtue then we think
[1:03:12] well that's just being a virgin well
[1:03:14] there's a whole lot more goes to it
[1:03:16] there's a whole lot more goes to this
[1:03:18] brotherly continent because if you're
[1:03:20] gonna take it to be the honey that seals
[1:03:22] us in remember there is only one honey
[1:03:30] that's worth anything
[1:03:31] that's the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[1:03:35] that is the new birth there is your
[1:03:38] honey that you really want and that's
[1:03:41] what I love about honey all over the
[1:03:43] world all waiting them got into the bee
[1:03:47] business we found out a lot of time
[1:03:48] honey all over the world is the same
[1:03:51] what consistent season seventeen percent
[1:03:56] water content all over the world and I
[1:03:59] used to wonder how and what all these
[1:04:01] things doing you know and why there's so
[1:04:03] many bees it's got to be around it you
[1:04:06] realize that they've got to keep that
[1:04:07] hive inside at one constant temperature
[1:04:11] whether it's winter ninety degree
[1:04:15] whether it's wintertime or summertime
[1:04:19] yeah they cool in the summer and the
[1:04:22] heat in the winter and ain't that
[1:04:23] something now what happens there's the
[1:04:25] beat is he turning his wings this way
[1:04:29] and it called it to be hotter and he
[1:04:31] turns them back the other way called it
[1:04:32] to be colder I don't know ain't nothing
[1:04:35] it's just I don't understand it but it's
[1:04:38] doing it they got to keep that and you
[1:04:42] can't rob them completely you got to
[1:04:44] leave them enough honey enough for them
[1:04:46] to eat no other time it's just
[1:04:49] and they only live so long anyway so but
[1:04:53] it's wonderful because that's honey in
[1:04:56] the rock you remember what we talked
[1:04:58] about the other day and the Prophet that
[1:04:59] was what was so wonderful when I heard
[1:05:01] that see we always we read these things
[1:05:04] in the Bible we read about the honey in
[1:05:06] the bag and everything you know and how
[1:05:08] they put it on the rock and we knew the
[1:05:10] stories but we didn't have it figured
[1:05:12] out totally
[1:05:14] little David Eichner take that dose
[1:05:17] cheap get sick and he didn't just go
[1:05:20] grab the first rock right no he found
[1:05:21] the right one because he found two rock
[1:05:23] minerals and things he rubs it on it and
[1:05:26] that animal starts licking it
[1:05:28] that was wonderful because that's honey
[1:05:31] in a rock okay all right get on to the
[1:05:34] next so like I said a lot of times
[1:05:38] people to me and I enjoy that part of
[1:05:40] they'll state what they're saying as a
[1:05:43] question or stated as what they believe
[1:05:46] to see if what you gonna believe is are
[1:05:49] something that's no problem to me see
[1:05:52] yeah as you have taught it does seem
[1:06:01] right that the believers in the Upper
[1:06:05] Room whom the Holy Spirit come came
[1:06:09] would have the entire pyramid except a
[1:06:13] headstone or capstone of the pyramid all
[1:06:17] right now brother Branham said the
[1:06:20] disciples had these virtues but he said
[1:06:23] stacks were perfect man he said now they
[1:06:25] did not how the headstone they did not
[1:06:29] have the headstone that's what he says
[1:06:31] all right so then we got to leave it to
[1:06:33] that point all right so then the pyramid
[1:06:36] the disciples as I've covered our minute
[1:06:40] to go in the message trying to just lay
[1:06:42] down a little bit see I've always taught
[1:06:45] you that on the day of Pentecost brother
[1:06:49] Branham was like I said we were talking
[1:06:51] one time these two brothers and one of
[1:06:53] them got everything when he believed and
[1:06:54] the other one said we ain't got it all
[1:06:55] yet I said would y'all mind if I just
[1:06:58] stay in the middle I said cause I can't
[1:07:01] go with you that way and a
[1:07:03] can't go with you that away the old mind
[1:07:05] if we just stay in the middle and the
[1:07:07] question was is where Berta Brennan said
[1:07:10] he met people who received the baptism
[1:07:12] with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:13] just like the day of Pentecost both of
[1:07:17] them admitted that they didn't know what
[1:07:19] he's talking about I said well let me
[1:07:22] stay in the middle and let's just tie
[1:07:24] together I said then under their
[1:07:26] Pentecost you got two things you've got
[1:07:31] a hundred and twenty in the upper room
[1:07:33] that were tutored and trained by the
[1:07:35] Lord Jesus and when the Holy Ghost fell
[1:07:39] it could position them in the body of
[1:07:42] the growth development because they
[1:07:44] already had their understanding open of
[1:07:47] the scriptures in the Book of Luke
[1:07:49] they'd already been breathed on in the
[1:07:52] book of John that even after his
[1:07:54] resurrection Jesus breathed on them and
[1:07:57] said receive ye the Holy Ghost the
[1:07:59] Prophet I'm glad of that si called we'd
[1:08:01] read that and say look are they got the
[1:08:02] Holy Ghost
[1:08:03] no they didn't get the Holy Ghost he had
[1:08:06] to go away come back brother Brent said
[1:08:09] that was a promise he said just like you
[1:08:11] say my stripes I'm healed he said that's
[1:08:14] a promise all right so then see we take
[1:08:17] the prophets answer to know that it's
[1:08:20] greater than all of our thoughts could
[1:08:22] be as to giving us understanding all
[1:08:25] right see they had been tutored and
[1:08:28] trained for three and a half years and
[1:08:31] when the Holy Ghost fell it could seal
[1:08:35] in all of these things - right here
[1:08:38] where it says the Holy Spirit on the
[1:08:40] pyramid they had these things sealed in
[1:08:44] but they did now the headstone called a
[1:08:47] headstone hadn't come now the headstone
[1:08:49] was standing there but the headstone
[1:08:53] didn't come on that penticoff the
[1:08:56] headstones to come to life stays is to
[1:09:02] come in the last days the headstone do
[1:09:05] you not know that's your according to
[1:09:07] your prophet now all right
[1:09:09] well now listen I agree with that
[1:09:12] because that's what I believe that those
[1:09:15] disciples had
[1:09:17] heard the word it had been opened unto
[1:09:20] them of their understanding in Luke 2:22
[1:09:24] I guess 21 22 or somewhere in Latin
[1:09:27] leister Luke as two times art it says he
[1:09:29] opened to them their understanding of
[1:09:32] the scriptures all right it doesn't mean
[1:09:34] that you get a revelation because your
[1:09:36] understanding is open that's where our
[1:09:40] problems that I will emphasize this
[1:09:43] while I'm on the point cuz that's hard
[1:09:45] to keep from preaching if we think
[1:09:47] because our understanding is open we get
[1:09:49] it that can be only one two disciples
[1:09:56] had without the baptism when the hold
[1:09:57] ago I used to go to this brothers church
[1:10:01] and preach he used to come to my house
[1:10:03] or I was in his home once a week just
[1:10:05] about it we were great brothers and one
[1:10:08] day I preached right here in this church
[1:10:09] and he heard it through somebody else
[1:10:11] which I doubted he heard the whole
[1:10:13] message Bini how I preached it brother
[1:10:16] Branham had the revelation of this right
[1:10:18] here and I said let's see this is my
[1:10:20] revelation let's see if my revelation is
[1:10:22] the same as what he's saying what was
[1:10:24] any problem with that well he sent me
[1:10:27] word he didn't want me around him no
[1:10:29] more and I'll on her down he said
[1:10:32] because you say you got a revelation he
[1:10:35] said I've got a revelation that brother
[1:10:37] Branham was only one had a revelation
[1:10:40] well I'm sorry I thought a little bit
[1:10:44] carnal I said I had a revelation of what
[1:10:48] this was that brother Branham said and
[1:10:50] he said he had a revelation did it he
[1:10:54] didn't have a revelation that didn't go
[1:10:59] through my my brain too good that you
[1:11:01] got a revelation that you don't have a
[1:11:03] revelation that's that's all right it's
[1:11:06] no problem I love to brother no problem
[1:11:09] nothing all right but now listen see
[1:11:14] when God gives you the Holy Ghost now
[1:11:17] I'm gonna say this is appointed I
[1:11:18] haven't covered a lot but see when I
[1:11:23] came in the message I've talked to you
[1:11:28] and told you of my experience
[1:11:30] that I was two years in this message
[1:11:32] before I reclaim the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:34] Ghost
[1:11:35] all right because when I heard the
[1:11:38] Prophet talking about the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:40] what it was and the seal and the word
[1:11:43] and a different thing I knew we didn't
[1:11:45] have it but I couldn't tell everybody
[1:11:49] else they didn't have it because they
[1:11:50] wasn't gonna listen so I said I don't
[1:11:52] have it because none of my business what
[1:11:55] you have I'm just trying to help you
[1:11:57] it's your business between you and God
[1:12:00] what you have see I knew what he was
[1:12:04] saying about the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:05] Ghost
[1:12:06] listen at that time I had seen I had was
[1:12:10] a deacon for three or four years in a
[1:12:12] Baptist Church at 23 years of age I
[1:12:14] talked to adult Sunday School classes I
[1:12:16] don't have a bit of those thing and I
[1:12:19] didn't come into this message and say
[1:12:21] well I come into message that proved I
[1:12:22] had it because when I heard the Prophet
[1:12:25] talking about what the baptism of the
[1:12:27] Holy Ghost really was and it was the
[1:12:28] birth of the word now you tell me how
[1:12:32] that you can get the Holy Ghost until
[1:12:35] you heard the word Brees now I ain't
[1:12:40] sayin I ain't sayin so don't you say it
[1:12:43] I ain't sayin they didn't have no word
[1:12:45] back there enough to get a birth
[1:12:47] I believe that Baptist Church right over
[1:12:49] there he's got enough of the Word of God
[1:12:51] to be able to produce a birth because
[1:12:54] all it takes is the egg under the dog
[1:12:56] right will hatch the egg as well as a
[1:12:59] chicken sitting on the egg I believe
[1:13:03] that so don't don't misquote me I'm just
[1:13:05] sayin for myself I knew that we were
[1:13:09] twisted and perverted in the word we had
[1:13:14] some things right we were doing pretty
[1:13:16] good the Prophet Bragg's on it said you
[1:13:18] better leave them Baptists alone that
[1:13:20] they'll tie you up with the word well
[1:13:22] they were pretty good with it and
[1:13:25] there's already lookin gonna told my
[1:13:26] wife when I read the Bible their one-day
[1:13:30] tour that melikhaya 3 and Malachi 4 did
[1:13:33] it look like it's gonna be two prophets
[1:13:34] coming I'd already told that I still in
[1:13:37] the Baptist Church but you see the new
[1:13:40] birth is the birth of the word now how
[1:13:43] can you
[1:13:44] have it birth in you till you get the
[1:13:46] word when we heard the work you heard
[1:13:52] perverted now can I quote the Prophet he
[1:13:56] said false prophets produce false birth
[1:14:00] someone would have false word can't
[1:14:02] produce it real true Bertha why it's
[1:14:06] important who you listen take that any
[1:14:13] way you want it it's very vital who you
[1:14:17] hear because if it's a false prophet
[1:14:21] it'll produce a false birth I believe
[1:14:24] the message well hey two years I was in
[1:14:27] this message I have read six books in
[1:14:29] one day and listened to two types you
[1:14:33] know you won't tackle that you think I
[1:14:35] didn't have a good knowledge I had a
[1:14:41] good job brother Kali can tell you about
[1:14:42] it I said right down there with him they
[1:14:44] could know where I was at my boss was
[1:14:47] real good and he he knew where I was at
[1:14:50] he told me he said go hide he didn't
[1:14:53] want to get me tied up called he didn't
[1:14:54] know what was doing he had to keep me
[1:14:56] loose to where we could place could run
[1:14:58] no he didn't know what we're doing
[1:15:00] that's no joke see I'd be sitting down
[1:15:03] with brother Kali and reading half the
[1:15:04] night already coming to church brother
[1:15:08] Mo tried his best to get me to you know
[1:15:10] move on a little but with about two
[1:15:12] years I I've become a deacon up at
[1:15:14] Gainesville but it was after I received
[1:15:17] the baptism with the Holy Ghost think
[1:15:21] plug this to yours
[1:15:23] how about you what's your experience
[1:15:25] what do you base it on what do you based
[1:15:29] your new birth on today I believe the
[1:15:35] Prophet so does the devil now where
[1:15:38] we're going when I come into message the
[1:15:42] devil was our full year we gotta come on
[1:15:47] that's the point of what I'm getting at
[1:15:50] the word that we need to make sure to
[1:15:54] get that word correct
[1:15:56] all right so then the person is making
[1:15:59] the statement about what they're saying
[1:16:02] about what is what I believe I believe
[1:16:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost came on
[1:16:08] the day of Pentecost to the 120 in the
[1:16:10] upper room and as it came it births the
[1:16:15] word that they hailed and that word that
[1:16:19] they helped positionally position them
[1:16:21] in the body I was explaining all of that
[1:16:24] little run-through right we called it
[1:16:27] rabbit trail for Aaron okay that we get
[1:16:30] off on these reef preachers we get off
[1:16:32] on these rabbit trails I was explaining
[1:16:34] the whole thing I believe that you can
[1:16:39] be born again you could start off at
[1:16:43] knowledge now what is holding this
[1:16:46] minute now you got to get to new birth
[1:16:49] at faith it's got to be faith but you
[1:16:51] ain't listening see you could already
[1:16:54] progressed in enough faith that God
[1:16:57] could position you higher than anybody
[1:17:00] else that's why I praise you for
[1:17:02] studying the word that's why I say study
[1:17:06] the word read the Bible I've read the
[1:17:08] Bible when I never got a thing have you
[1:17:11] ever done that have you ever read the
[1:17:13] prophets method you ever listen to a
[1:17:14] tape now for a while when you finish the
[1:17:16] tape walk out and say what did I get now
[1:17:22] very riotous you're not going to get
[1:17:23] something by the Prophet but how many
[1:17:25] times if you took the Bible and read it
[1:17:27] and read it and read it and then one day
[1:17:30] you open up that same scripture to look
[1:17:32] at it and say who wrote that you know
[1:17:36] somebody put that in there cause he
[1:17:39] wasn't in that lifetime I read it like
[1:17:41] 10 times I read it it wasn't in there it
[1:17:44] was God quickening through this mind the
[1:17:46] brain that would open up time but open
[1:17:49] that up doesn't mean you're born again
[1:17:51] to open your understanding of the
[1:17:53] scripture doesn't mean you're born again
[1:17:55] it is part of the fact of believing and
[1:17:58] showing it it's not going to be open to
[1:18:02] you if you don't have the new birth but
[1:18:04] physically speaking you can get a lot of
[1:18:06] head knowledge and that's wonderful
[1:18:11] you know it's wonderful to get head
[1:18:15] knowledge see because only by getting
[1:18:18] head knowledge can you get all the ghost
[1:18:19] knowledge okay okay now this is the more
[1:18:23] of the statement see talking about the
[1:18:25] disciples and them receiving it as to
[1:18:28] were that they received it of the Holy
[1:18:31] Spirit they could have the pyramid
[1:18:34] except the headstone or the capstone
[1:18:36] okay because the headstone has not come
[1:18:38] yet
[1:18:38] all right I explained that a minute ago
[1:18:41] the headstone wasn't even there back in
[1:18:43] in that time the headstone can only come
[1:18:46] in the last days and it's your prophet
[1:18:48] city I didn't I didn't say yeah and he
[1:18:51] and the person says they had the Old
[1:18:53] Testament and the teachings and deeds of
[1:18:56] Jesus Christ
[1:18:57] including than listen including the
[1:19:01] seven seals of Matthew 24 the disciples
[1:19:04] had that they learned they had the
[1:19:07] teachings of the Old Testament they had
[1:19:09] the deeds of the Lord Jesus they had to
[1:19:12] seal sometimes they had everything in
[1:19:16] order you know to were that it could be
[1:19:22] birthed this is what the Holy Ghost
[1:19:27] would come to in order to Burke them as
[1:19:30] full-grown Christians you don't start
[1:19:36] Adam and Eve as I said a moment ago Adam
[1:19:39] and Eve wouldn't born babies and grown
[1:19:41] up you don't start you got to start the
[1:19:46] kingdom that's full grown so the
[1:19:49] disciples had to spend three and a half
[1:19:51] years with the Lord Jesus to get
[1:19:53] everything in order
[1:19:54] till when the Holy Ghost fell it would
[1:19:56] be able to do as he said the Holy Ghost
[1:20:00] through a brain to you remembers
[1:20:01] whatsoever I've taught and said in other
[1:20:04] words brother Branham paraphrasing it he
[1:20:06] takes it on he said it even teach you
[1:20:07] things to come see they had a wonderful
[1:20:12] position they were standing with and
[1:20:15] when the Holy Ghost came
[1:20:16] it could quicken that and make them what
[1:20:19] we would call for grown Christians which
[1:20:22] would be right here Holy Spirit
[1:20:24] down leave the headstone to come in the
[1:20:26] last days all right
[1:20:29] he said well Jesus what sure hey man
[1:20:31] Jesus was the headstone but he wouldn't
[1:20:34] make any manifest all right now so I
[1:20:42] agree with that part that they had been
[1:20:46] tutored and trained all right and then
[1:20:50] here's the point so you'll have to jump
[1:20:52] with it to listen to the thought decades
[1:20:55] later which means time later you know
[1:20:57] after a while when the New Testament
[1:21:00] church had the writings of Paul Peter
[1:21:03] James and John they had more effect or
[1:21:10] whatever could be said what effect did
[1:21:13] this have on the inner man in other
[1:21:19] words possessing him they had as I said
[1:21:24] you jump you got to an upper room you
[1:21:27] got to you got the people you got the
[1:21:29] Holy Ghost coming they had to fooled
[1:21:31] fooled brother Ron said they had these
[1:21:33] virtues all right
[1:21:35] had these virtues okay and they were
[1:21:39] birth dire then they were teaching Peter
[1:21:42] was teaching people how to being born
[1:21:45] again was the statue of a perfect man
[1:21:48] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[1:21:50] temperance he was teaching them how to
[1:21:52] do that and they already had a the
[1:21:55] background from the Lord Jesus and then
[1:21:58] they started with the writings of Paul
[1:21:59] Peter in them and see then you can
[1:22:03] clarify really and bring it through the
[1:22:05] ages if you brain correctly wait brought
[1:22:07] it here while back you should have
[1:22:09] listened to that the full word of God ly
[1:22:11] stood to the fourth church age now
[1:22:13] that's the words of the Prophet see when
[1:22:17] you get up to Martin in Calamba you know
[1:22:20] brother Bradley said there was no
[1:22:22] greater man than understanding outside
[1:22:24] the Lord Jesus except other words he put
[1:22:27] Martin right there as the greatest of
[1:22:31] all understand Columba was a great man
[1:22:35] see they taught the
[1:22:37] virtues in these things they told her
[1:22:39] requirements they told Christianity
[1:22:42] added a disciple to within it distorted
[1:22:44] naturally and it already some faded away
[1:22:47] and then it just started fading away
[1:22:50] once you've done away with those
[1:22:51] messengers who really held to the line
[1:22:55] who was it Martin was it Martin that the
[1:22:59] devil come to and is that the right one
[1:23:01] Martin one of them that the devil come
[1:23:03] to him you know and he stood I looked at
[1:23:05] him he said get out of here he said yeah
[1:23:10] you got a crown on and said according to
[1:23:12] the according to the word said will
[1:23:14] crown you said thanks you get out of
[1:23:17] here most of us who maybe never donated
[1:23:22] you know a little scared he wasn't
[1:23:26] scared he told to get out of here right
[1:23:28] all right
[1:23:30] see with the decades then later in other
[1:23:33] words time see then you could make the
[1:23:36] pure under and versus this statement
[1:23:38] from brother branham that the pure
[1:23:39] unadulterated word went into the ground
[1:23:41] at Nicaea alright you can bring it over
[1:23:44] to the fourth church age and see that
[1:23:47] that's where it started going into the
[1:23:50] ground you come out in Luther Wesley
[1:23:52] them you come out with the understanding
[1:23:54] see by the time you come out with Luther
[1:23:56] you had done officer revelation of the
[1:23:58] Godhead you had about a thousand years
[1:24:00] between or something in between Columbia
[1:24:03] and Luther and you fifteen hundred years
[1:24:05] and you had lost a lot of the
[1:24:07] understanding of the word and and
[1:24:09] started out having to rewrite and do you
[1:24:13] know Laura because see I'll state this
[1:24:20] one it says the Upper Room saints had
[1:24:23] and assist those outside the upper room
[1:24:26] in growing Phi stir up the stature of a
[1:24:29] perfect man I agree with that because
[1:24:32] that's what I'm trying to do no I mean
[1:24:37] you tell me you're born again I'm going
[1:24:38] to say you're born again well I mean you
[1:24:41] tell me I've had a new birth Roselle I'm
[1:24:43] gonna say you've had a new birth but I'm
[1:24:45] gonna say no alright now let's grow up
[1:24:47] in here you know let's grow up and he
[1:24:52] that's all I've been teaching for 50
[1:24:54] years is growing up in him it's a daily
[1:25:00] growth it's a daily understanding and I
[1:25:04] admit a lot of times you do just did a
[1:25:06] minute ago sometimes you can read the
[1:25:08] message and you don't get it you were to
[1:25:12] see some of my books you were to see
[1:25:15] Daniel 70 weeks where I had questions I
[1:25:17] don't understand this I don't understand
[1:25:20] this I had questions it's all over every
[1:25:22] page you know I would not dare preach on
[1:25:25] that to level when those questions was
[1:25:26] marked up and put her okay because if I
[1:25:31] had a question I've done it would endure
[1:25:34] to try to con teach anybody else because
[1:25:36] you know what I teach them I'd teach
[1:25:38] them and leaving hang in with the
[1:25:39] question because that's where I was
[1:25:41] hanging in right so I had questions all
[1:25:45] right but not listening see it's always
[1:25:48] helped me to know that the Old Testament
[1:25:51] is the New Testament what is it
[1:25:53] conceited or what is it good dry and
[1:25:59] concealed okay all right and the New
[1:26:02] Testament is the Old Testament revealed
[1:26:04] I believe that the New Testament is the
[1:26:07] Old Testament revealed with the baptism
[1:26:09] the differ between the Old Testament and
[1:26:11] you is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:15] you said know Jesus when you had to how
[1:26:18] Jesus get the baptism the holy God so
[1:26:21] the Old Testament in the New Testament
[1:26:22] comes out to be the wings of the eagle
[1:26:26] all right now I like this statement so
[1:26:31] it's not a question it's a statement of
[1:26:34] point do you think it would make a good
[1:26:38] steady to find where all of the seven
[1:26:41] virtues are mentioned in the Old and New
[1:26:45] Testament and look at the context of
[1:26:48] each time it is mentioned I agree with
[1:26:51] that 100% I just wish I had time if I
[1:26:55] ever get slowing down enough I'll try to
[1:26:56] do that I've thought of that on the
[1:26:59] series of doing and trying you know and
[1:27:01] mention a little bit as a matter of fact
[1:27:04] we'll take Wednesday night a little bit
[1:27:07] on something right around said and
[1:27:09] you'll see that I was taking this
[1:27:11] scripture over here and backwards and
[1:27:13] forth because I believe it's mention no
[1:27:16] I like this one too
[1:27:20] would it not be better to include the
[1:27:24] seven Church ages the seventy weeks
[1:27:28] Christ the mystery when you're talking
[1:27:33] about the capstone message since those
[1:27:39] truths are so interrelated I agree now
[1:27:45] let me put it in the way to so you can
[1:27:48] understand certain things all right and
[1:27:51] not other things so the greatest one out
[1:27:54] of the mall is the statue of a perfect
[1:27:57] man when the headstone unites with the
[1:27:59] body you're going to understand the
[1:28:00] statute of a perfect man more than you
[1:28:02] ever thought about because that's the
[1:28:04] one message I love that's the one I love
[1:28:08] it cuz you know what the Prophet said he
[1:28:11] said if you have any question don't
[1:28:14] steal some time or did he say go he said
[1:28:18] come out cross the mystery oh that's a
[1:28:22] wonderful message so I believe when the
[1:28:25] head unites with the body church that
[1:28:27] it's going to illuminate or not in other
[1:28:31] words it's going to really show us what
[1:28:34] these things are talking about all of
[1:28:37] them
[1:28:38] you know I believe predestination will
[1:28:41] be a greater understanding of went after
[1:28:45] the uniting of the head for the body one
[1:28:48] God will be of a great understand all
[1:28:50] the Bible will become unfolded because
[1:28:52] to me that's what I'm talking about in a
[1:28:54] simple little term see you take that
[1:28:56] head if you draw this pyramid correct
[1:28:57] you take this head you can put on these
[1:28:59] corners you don't try to do it here now
[1:29:03] because you're a little bit off ways and
[1:29:04] when you're drawing just to her but if
[1:29:07] you really put it there see because he's
[1:29:09] the head of the corner he's the head of
[1:29:14] the corner
[1:29:16] but then he's the headstone of the
[1:29:18] corner right see when we get to this
[1:29:24] message unfolding it's going to be a
[1:29:27] wonderful thing to me how it's unfolded
[1:29:31] for all of these 50 years it's been
[1:29:34] wonderful I have thoroughly enjoyed it
[1:29:38] what I'm looking forward every day to
[1:29:42] more of understanding of the word of God
[1:29:47] anybody got a question for we go we got
[1:29:49] about 10 minutes you thought all right
[1:29:57] come on museums will end it up I hope
[1:30:02] you'll just listens comes to me my
[1:30:08] emphasis is upon one time where would
[1:30:12] you and I be if God hadn't sent a
[1:30:15] prophet where would we be if God hadn't
[1:30:22] sent a problem I'm being physically you
[1:30:26] know that I put my whole life on - you
[1:30:32] know the fact that God sent a prophet I
[1:30:37] have no other things I have no other
[1:30:39] thoughts there's not a thought
[1:30:41] considered in my mind that is another
[1:30:44] prophet gonna come straighten out this
[1:30:46] prophet that's not scriptural he was
[1:30:50] either the prophet or not the Prophet
[1:30:52] and if he's not the prophet didn't who
[1:30:54] are you trying to be that's what I've
[1:30:56] always said to people if I can straight
[1:30:59] and brother branham how you're supposed
[1:31:01] to be following me not brother branham
[1:31:03] is that sensible that would be playing
[1:31:07] because if I could straighten him out I
[1:31:09] got to be greater than he is don't see
[1:31:13] this that's where the people wouldn't
[1:31:15] stand up with brother Branham and he'd
[1:31:18] say if you don't believe what I'm
[1:31:19] teaching you bring your Bible come over
[1:31:20] here and stand women what they wouldn't
[1:31:23] do it they were smart he said I give
[1:31:28] more respect
[1:31:29] he knew there wasn't gonna come up there
[1:31:32] he but what about it we've had the most
[1:31:39] wonderful message that could ever be
[1:31:42] thought of cause it curves us all the
[1:31:44] way from the new birth to the change of
[1:31:47] the body in the future home
[1:31:48] the things what else should we need to
[1:31:55] see we need our own ideas to just die
[1:31:57] and let Christ me understand what we got
[1:32:01] with you anybody have a need the older
[1:32:07] folk
[1:32:07] [Music]
[1:32:16] remember way to be minister in this
