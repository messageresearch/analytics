us we certainly came down to pay our respects our love for uh the canada family who's brother george joseph and the whole family there and we thank god for brother george i tell you i told my wife i said my wife had the opportunity last year to go and and to meet brother george and we uh she he told her about the time that the prophet had turned and looked up at him said that god healed speech impediment and so my wife she went back because that was the first person she had met that personally had received a word directly regarding healing so she went back and told the believers in in venezuela and so i i told of course over the years i've expressed to my wife how much we appreciated brother george and the canada family coach brother joseph and i the first trip out to or down to venezuela in 1995 we had been praying and and seeking the lord and from that time the work that god has given us through uh south america certainly has been his leadership but we had those times to come up and i know brother george kind of lending his son out to the mission field and uh but we thank god for for brothers george the life the influence that he made on my life and and so when we were there and just in uh afterward brother dale asked so we could come by tonight and we we certainly appreciate it we always have appreciated you've been family to us it's not my first time so we're we're family here and we know that you love the word here and and it's just wonderful to come and my wife said i didn't know you i could tell they really really appreciate you so many people came up and said hey brother andre god bless you the other day and i said yeah i've been over the years i've had the wonderful opportunity the fellowship with all the wonderful brothers and and uh and and we've we've seen each other grow in the revelation of jesus christ and so thankful that god has a body of believers that are stabilized and certainly a time like this and and we we know who we are and what we've been raised up to do in this hour and so we certainly thank god for the family of god before we get started in the word uh my wife and i we we got back from venezuela april the 11th of this year of course i don't have to tell you if you've heard any kind of news you know that the president of venezuela chavez passed away earlier this year and the country's just really in turmoil the inflation and just just a real tense situation there in south america now but we my wife and i we arrived april 11th actually we were doing more work starting to do more work in northern brazil a few years ago i met a wonderful brother his name is brother marcio de gama and he's from manaus he was born and raised in manaus brazil and many years ago the lord led him to venezuela he established in churches in venezuela a wonderful pastor in venezuela but the lord took him back to brazil and a couple of years ago he was having a uh um a convention and an in uh in the eastern part of venezuela and he said well andre i'd like for you to come and be a part of the convention well we came and after that he said i want to take you over to brazil i want you and your wife to come to brazil and and so we went over and of course he passes the church and announced there and we had some wonderful services there and boa vista and monas a couple of other places and so the lord blessed me there and this last year he said now brother andre i want you to come i want you to come and it's just tremendous and you know here and i'll i'll just be just plain with you the five-fold ministry this is the holy ghost in action it's you know man can put himself up he can try to establish himself he can have all the credentials he wants to but god has a ministry and a ministry that is directed by god it's not hit and miss hope so maybe so god has a ministry in the earth and he's he's perfecting his bride the message has been preached but it has to be taught and people have to be positionally placed in their position to know who they are in their inheritance because the book of redemption has been been opened seven seals christ has taken the seals off of himself we know who we are the abstract deed people are holding abstract title deed in their hands to life what adam fell from they've been restored back to that right and just waiting on the adoption to wit the redemption of our bodies and all of the these great things that the leadership of eternal life is bringing us into because you don't know the things of god by intellect you know the things by the holy spirit leading you into the word leadership brings the very mind of god to the bride and it's our soul so god in his father ministry just directed precisely to where they need to be to to to meet the need of the body in this hour and how wonderful that god has done this not through manmade uh uh uh uh uh knowledge but through revelation and through humility and the body of his word and so brother marshall he said bro andre i want you to come come again and so i said well i told my wife i said he called i said brother mark said i won't be able to make my wife's mother needed the surgery many things had come up and we had to get ready to come here turmoil in the country there i i said call brother martin and tell him i won't be able to make it but deep in my heart i felt you got to go and i wanted to go but you see the last thing you want to do on the mission work or anywhere is to try to do god a service without it being his will you want to find the mind of god the leadership of god people are out there doing all kinds of things in this day and look at the day we live in man in his conceptions of what he thinks god we don't need man in his conception of what he thinks god we we don't know we we are in a message that will transform us and if we're not hearing from god we're just we're becoming foolish virgin material when we don't want that we want to be hearing from the throne of god we want to the the the holy ghost leading into a different atmosphere a different dimension oh eternal life not something laying out there in the future but eternal life opening up and god by seven seal coming leading his children not how much i know or who can out quote somebody else who but god by seven seal coming opening his word bringing the believer into a higher dimension than humanity than what man conception can think of and we're thankful that that we have a god who knows how to lead his children how to bring the unwritten word by the seed word planted in their hearts that's so wonderful when a people and god looking to an end to bring a victory his victory that's who you are his victory the bride she is the very absolute of the bible she's the end of the bible she's the amen of the word of god in this last hour and that's a wonderful thing to be a part of that and it's wonderful because we know that we didn't make ourselves a part of it but the predestination and the foreknowledge of god through election chose positionally placed us called anointed us and that's a wonderful thing and so i you know i said brother marcy i'm not going to be able to come and so we hung the phone off i told my wife i said sweet let's pray and we did and after we projected you call brother martial so brother martial israel andre when do you need me there yeah he said brother andre he said i'm gonna have to apologize to your wife but we want to get you as soon as possible and uh because my wife's mother had to have an operation and oh how the enemy just used that thing but god god took care of that and mother didn't have to have the operation god brought his healing power on the scene that's right that's right and so he said you're going to have to go to manaus and and we have the plaintiffs you're going to have to fly down to baleen you're going to be there for two weeks and you're going to be here i said okay we're we're gonna come and so we're excited about coming but i had what in venezuela i have what's called a cellular and that's like a a visa a permit for me to be there and the dates were running out and they were clashing with the same dates that i was supposed to be in brazil and so i thought lord what am i going to do and and oh my just bureaucracy it's just a mess there and just chaos and so i thought lord help me what are we going to do and so when we got over to brazil in february we we were actually in a place called santi elena and that's on the border between venezuela and brazil and so i had my sailor but the days were running out maybe i had one week before i was supposed to get another cellular a new visa from venezuela but we me and my wife we had taken care of this work we had been two months earlier a month earlier we had all the documentation we had paid more but yet they just one excuse after the other excuse and i thought hello what's going on here and so when we got to brazil they they said well let's look at your papers and they looked at the papers we're at the front here and the the the the guard there the the the frontier guard they're just so staunch and and so rough and they looked at the paper and said no you're not going to be able to come to brazil even though you're an american you as an american you should have got a visa when you're in the united states you see you're trying to come from venezuela even though your wife's a venezuelan and you have a sailor here and we permit the venezuelans to cross with a cellular it looks like your dates are running out and i said i tried to explain to him look the reason my dates are running out is because and see here they gave me this temporary and they just didn't want to hear it and i thought well and brother marshall said i don't know what we're going to do because even even this night brother andre in bora vista we got meetings and you got to be there we got an interpreter coming all the way from announce and and and so brother martial talked to the to the the the the uh like the superintendent there of the border patrol and he said no there's nothing we can do for you you what you should do just go to go down to the the the brazilian consulate which is in santellena it's only 15 minutes from here and tell them you need a visa there so we went there but because they have what's called carnival and they they call in louisiana mardi gras they have that big carnival throughout south america ain't none but a bunch of reverse and uh so we went there and they said no we're close because of money because of mardi gras so you're going to have to come back next week and then you're going to have to wait to this and we thought mom so brother mark so he said you know we've exalted every means to to get this visa we don't know what we're going to do and of course we pray and we we thought the lord and i said well i'll tell you what brother marcel i i i know somebody that can touch god he said who was that i said my wife she know how to pray i i said let me call her and he said it's not brother he said we believe in prayer but we've we've been up there bro andre and brother martial called my wife she's there she she knows these things and brother marcio hear the tape you know these things are true brother martial said what are you going to do bro andre i said let's go back once more to the border patrol let's go back once more so he called my wife said i said sweetheart i told her what was going on oh my that visa they they didn't do your papers and so i said sweetheart i don't want you to pray lord please let my husband into brazil i said don't pray that way pray thy kingdom come thy will be done amen not god let my husband in pray our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come i said pray that way yeah because i don't want to do god a service if you don't want me to go here brazil i don't want to go to brazil and so we went back to the so so we went back to the frontier policeman and when we got there you know you know when when god moves for you when god moves through it for you you just have to take it you know i mean god will move for you and it's like god he moved for me but god he he moves for you but he ain't just giving it to you like ice cream you still got to take it that's right you got to take everything that you have you've got to possess it you got to put the steak down say this is mine god you promised it lord he loves that and so we went back and it wasn't like the the border patrol and everybody just bowed down to me went back and there was another officer in and and and when we came this one officer said oh no this guy he's already been here twice and the chief said he can't come in because his papers are not right et cetera et cetera et cetera and the other guy who was sitting beside him who was higher ranking than him said well what's going on and they discussed what was going on he said sir i'm sorry you just can't go in we just can't permit you you're gonna have to get your paperwork done might take you a while but but you have to do it and i said sir we're going to abide by the the sovereign laws of brazil we're not trying to try to get in there and sneak in we're going to abide by your laws and things he said sure yeah this is the right way and so he uh and so brother martial said you but you have no law that could permit this man to come in because he's married to a venezuelan venezuelans come in all the time so why can't this guy come in he said no of course he is he's a matter of views but he's an american he doesn't have a visa from the united states he can't come in and so but he said but you say oh he said i'll look at the books i'll show you so he began to look through the through the like the the state department for the for the for the visas and and what permits you need and and what kind of uh of waivers they could give to to cross over and so he um he looked and he looked and and then this other woman came up and and got in the argument with him and and man i just thought man lord i just sit there and then i thought eric then he said you know i believe we got something here and he said no no that won't work for you oh my that's a that's a quantum to be in a real situation to be in and you know over the years 18 years we've been by god's grace doing work throughout venezuela and through mexico and through colombia and through the islands of the trinidad i remember when brother steve and i had to get on a ferry and and go from trinidad to to to grenada there and the boat that we got on we didn't know it was a drug smuggling boat and so when i went back to trinidad they said you rode this boat to grenada i said uh yes sir said throw your passport away that boat has been under investigation you don't want anything to do with that but but yeah they took it it got me there and got me back and different things like that but but this was a real trial here though and so i just weighed and i thought lord well maybe i'm just not supposed to go or we'll just see lord we'll just wait and so the woman was arguing hey and the man and then finally just she just kind of left she got her things together and i thought and then i heard that this chief who had already said no that morning maybe he was coming back in now and i thought well he if this man a hurry up and rush it but you see god god's not about rushing things god god ain't trying to god's not trying to force a peace where it doesn't belong he doesn't have to do that he's sovereign in himself he he has direct control of his ministry that's right and when they get out of line he knows how to bring him back in line there yes he does and so the the gentleman he looked he said he said we have a we have a clause here that a brazilian with authority said brother he said excuse me sir he's starting to brother martial he said are you a pastor here in in brazil and brother marshall said yeah i pulled out his credentials he's registered with brazil so yes sir i'm a pastor here he says we have a clause here that says if you will take full responsibility you can take this man for 10 days and oh my blessed be the name of the lord so so so i got the paper and and then they stamped it and then the gentleman said you have him back in 10 days if he's not back in 10 days then you're going to be in trouble he's going to be in trouble also said no brother marshall said no we the last thing we want to do is cause problems we don't want to cause problems and so what happened is we had to take from from the border there we had to take a little taxi to bora vista and so what happens when you pass through the the the borderline about a mile down the road there is another security and it's there in case someone sneaks through the border then they have to go through this other uh guard office like a national guard there and so when we went there we drove there i was sitting on the passenger seat well martial his wife was sitting in the back and the driver there and the policeman he came around with with his guns pistols and his guns very intimidating he walked around and looked at the driver just look stare at him to let know you know i'm the man here and walked around looked at toe brothers in the back let the window down then he walked over to where i was he said get out of the car so i got a car he said give me your papers getting the papers you looked at them enjoy your trip thank you lord thank you lord amen you just have to go through those experience to understand they they really try you and and sometimes you think everything's going to be smooth and all lottie dotty but it's not that way you have to know you have to you have to know that god has called you in this hour and so lord i believe we're supposed to go there but if we're not we're not going to do anything illegal we're not going to do something we're not we're going to wait on the lord and so we did and god gave us a wonderful trip there we were in brazil for 34 days and my mother's my wife's mother she was getting really having a problem and the lord hadn't moved manifested her healing and so my fam my wife's family they were putting pressure on her and her mother was putting pressure and the enemy said you need why you just run off and leave your wife you need to get back there you get back there and help her i said sweetheart i love you i'm praying for your mother i've got to obey the word of the lord i've got to press on and god showed us a great thing in that always put the lord first always obey his word first he loves to try you that way to see if your desires are to him but we had a wonderful trip there we were in brazil for 34 days and lord willing i know a lot of people ask brother andre when are you going to be headed back really i don't want to sound uh juvenile or or childish but really as a missionary as a missionary for 18 years it's not just what i do it's who i am you see brother dale he's not just pastoring he's a pastor you see that's his calling in life and so for you to say well brother andre are you going to come down you're settling down how does a missionary settle down how how do i do it do i do i'd say well okay i'm not are you doing mission at all i'm just up here in east tennessee just just surviving now that's not who god made me to be so but i know it sounds elementary to say uh well when he and and i'm saying that putting myself in your shoes really you you have to just wait on the word of the lord and what we're doing we we're writing a letter to brother martial because venezuela has the word of the lord that country has they they hold that word stronger than any south american any any latino country venezuela is strong with the word they have the minister we and god help us and missionaries have come and the ministers there are great ministers studied and convinced about this message and so and and so even even it has stood when so many countries have failed to to ideas of men and and and and and different doctrines that are just blowing the people over and venezuela by god's grace for for the a better part they've held this but they're in in brazil and of course your own pastor brother brother dale has been instrumental for the the duplication of books and things like that in brazil but just the confusion and the mess that's in in brazil especially the southern part which i'm thankful to the lord not to be any part of that southern part but up in the northern part there's real hungry souls like i said they've heard the preaching of the word but they they want to be taught the word and the ministry's apt to talk there's of course there's teachers in the five fold ministry ordained teachers your teachers here that that can bring that work and bring things out of that word but the ministry in whole they're apt to teach and that's where we see the body at it's not the times where i used to tell you you remember when i just tell you i went down with brother cyan we were wrestling the anacondas and and the alligators there was that time we did that and and trying to avoid getting bit by the bushmaster and and all of those things we did that we have the pictures of that holding up anacondas we got there holding up alligator we got all that we went through that but but but that's not it though see that that's just a little part what is it is getting the word to where it belongs and where it needs to be and so we see in this season god has turned the corner just like we left the church ages we're not in the church ages we're in the son of man ministry we're we're in the we're in the the broad age the word aids it's a wonderful thing because the church agent look at the church ages today look at the church today look at the nations today the world is falling apart handwriting on the wall the world look at this country in a sort of my condition the president of this country baptized this nation with a homosexual demon look at the people it's one thing for a man to walk in the street and say oh we believe in homosexuality it's okay but when the leader of a land a president of a land who is the representative of that land when he pronounced something like that he released a homosexual demon on the united states now look at him coming out of the wall [Applause] all this perversion and wickedness the world and this country is on the side of my condition but brother brahman said it would be that way in the anointed ones at the end time he said three things remember three things he said the world will be in a sodomite condition and at that time janice and jambis would rise up and we see these scoffers today scoffing the word saying that the cloud was some uh rocket fuel gas blowed up discrediting the hand scoffers in the last days but he said also in that time the son of man would be revealed to the elected bride oh we know where we're standing we're marching to zion and so we we see all of these things taking place we see the mood of the people we see people becoming unconcerned about the message no enthusiasm people don't read and listen to messages anymore and that's you know i drill that thing in south america i say you have these books now and all these false doctrines are coming through and you're not even reading the messages you're not listening to the word you've got to stay in the word you've got to stay there these two spirits are too close and so we're trying to just when we come from brazil we just preaching there on the supreme deity of the the white wigged one the cloud the seven angels coming down vindicating this message and said now you've got all these false doctrines coming through you're not going to evade them by association just because you associate with a certain church doesn't bring you security you've got to be baptized with the holy ghost you've got to be sealed in the body of jesus christ you got to be you got to be in the word so that the bridegroom would understand who her husband is the bride would understand the bridegroom because she's connected with word she knows who she is that's right she knows she's his victory she knows that she will manifest the full victory of calvary that's right she knows that this great third pool the holy ghost opening up the word and a prophet of god standing between the six and seventh seal calling out abroad just like those two witnesses will stand between the sixth and seventh trumpet bringing israel back to their homeland we know that people can people can say those things but it takes that holy ghost to open up eternal life to you and bring you into a to a relationship begin to interpret the word in your life to express the individual person of his coming in your life he speak to you just like he spoke to the woman with the blood issue where did she read what book did she read in the old testament that she could touch to him of his garment and be made well where did she read that from what chapter is from exodus numbers deuteronomy this year from jeremiah isaiah she did not read it but the leadership of the holy ghost brings you into a dimension with himself this is a sealed person of his coming and that's why when people are arguing over the word i know more than you i cannot preach that's not even called to it it's an individual thing and god opens that brings you into a world that you never knew that that that your human mind can't interpret it and you brought on the expectation of the leadership of life oh my what a time to know that you've been called to these things by the election of god and that they belong to you and so we're thankful for that we're thankful that our young people not being religious but can take this simple word of god and say hey i believe god's word lord help me in school help me in the universe help me with my friends not some religious act not something religious put on but life we fell from life we fell from eternal life we fell from somewhere but in this last days god said i will restore and he has he's restored us back from where we've fallen from and that's who you are and so we had that wonderful time in brazil i just want to share that with you and so it's just wonderful what god is doing throughout south america the different countries there and then come back up here to united states see you moving with the word growing in the revelation of jesus christ fighting these battles but fighting with a sword in your hand the word of god deny you speaking the word in expectation of what you're believing for see so when when faith is positive then god leads you to a place where he can challenge you that's right that's what god did to esther he queen esther she didn't know she when mordecai said look you're trying you're looking for self-preservation you're trying to save yourself you were brought here for a purpose for such a time as this and so she thought just because she was beautiful she she kind of hide away in the palace you can hide away in the palace god had placed her there and took her from hadassah to esther god had done it god had raised her god had placed her so he could challenge her to believe his word and so she had to make a decision every woman that ever represented abroad had to make a decision rebecca had to make a decision ruth had to make a decision hacked here right had to make a decision you see they all had to make a decision when the word was presented to them would they make that decision esther had to make that decision mordecai wrote her letter said esther you know she said okay fast tell the whole kingdom of fast three ages three knights because i'm going to see the king god challenged her and the leadership of the holy ghost challenges you brother brown said when he was when he was in that field where he created those squirrels you've read the message prayer of faith go to the end there at the prayer line brother branham said he challenged me to speak those things but god would never challenge you until he's brought you to a place that he knows that you will react accordingly because he's restoring you he's bringing you back to where you've fallen from you heard from that theophany that's right you heard the word of god become eagle food to you and you begin to exercise your right your god-given rights in your inheritance because god said i am going to restore god he's meticulous and direct with his word he forgets nothing he establishes things set things up so that there would come a time you'd have to come through those things he in great creation god's saying let there be light and there was light and god said it was good and on the second day the bible says that god he separates the waters from the earth makes an expansion of firmament lifts the water up off the earth leaves water there you have the dry land he continues to create but on that second day he never said it is good he never said he goes to the third day it is good dry land up here animals appear it is good he gets to the sixth day he says it is very good why because he's created a man in his own image but god who never misses anything why didn't he say it was very good on the second day why because he knew the same waters that he lifted off the earth in noah's day he would change the chemical form of that send it back down in the form of rain and it would destroy humanity he never misses to be he knew again that those same waters that he brought up at the end of the world because the earth is preserved to fire that same elements would burn the earth over he never forgets anything he's meticulous and direct with his word amen and so when he gives you a promise and he says i'm going to make you this right then he's going to make you that doesn't matter the circumstances he's doing that the holy ghost the only revealer of the divine word of god is doing that i will restore saith the lord what's 8 o'clock i'm not going to keep you too much longer but we've got to stand i've got to read the scripture if you have your bibles let's turn to psalms chapter one the preacher started preaching before it was time to start preaching yeah i'm wearing glassware i'm wearing bro these glasses for brother wade today [Laughter] god bless you i'm in in psalms chapter one psalms chapter 1 and before we read let us just go to the author of the word kind heavenly father lord how thankful we are to be in your divine presence lord and father when we look

not turn to the left or right may we meditate like you told joshua meditate day and night so that you'll prosper in all your ways father we ask for this lord why because we desire to please you lord we desire to live for you lord we desire lord for you to smile and say this is my son this is my daughter lord we desire to walk like enoch walk lord at a testimony that he pleased you lord before his translation lord we desire this and much more lord because you have poured out yourself to us and in us and through us lord and we ask father that you'll have the preeminence may all things be said for your glory and for your edification in jesus christ lovely name we pray amen psalms 1 chapter 1 verse 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord that's his word and in his word or in his law does he meditate day and night and he look at the scriptures it's going to compare him now it's going to compare this man whose delight is in the word of the lord verse 3 and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water brother brown says the rivers of one water he's planted you remember jesus said whatever my father did not plant would be plucked up [Music] and we see everything getting plucked up these days except that kingdom that's been planted on matthew 16 who do men say that i the son of man am right that's right he shall be and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season that's wonderful that's right brother branham said he said in the message uh the the the caliph the the cankle the the palma worm the cankerworm and the caterpillar brother branham said priest in 1959. brother brown says when david said this he was looking at jesus christ he was looking at the tree of life and his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper that's you the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the lord the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his words he may be seated in a message preached in 1962 called the signs of his coming brother brown says now he says he's quoting from joel he says i will restore saith the lord what will i do i will bring her back to her original condition amen i will bring her back to her original doctrine i will bring her back to the original word and i will break every denomination in pieces i will bring her back to my word in 1962 it was a tremendous year for our prophet brother branham because this prophet of the lord had been led by the lord amen to manifest what was in god's mind and the things that god was planning to do because surely the lord will do nothing except he revealed it unto his servants the prophet and so in brother brannon's life when he got to the year of 1962 something began to change and because god said he was going to do these things restore that bride restore her to the original word restore her to the original doctrine he had to have a way to do that and he was going to do it through the prophetic amen he was going to raise up the prophet the prophet to prophesy exactly what was going to take place and so in even in brother branham's life when he gets to 19 even before 1962 but specifically in 1962 him being an eagle he's an eagle he can look down through the church ages and he can see the people crying for revival trying to to have the power of god but he says how can you cry and how can you desire this if things has not been restored he began to recognize brother branham that the bride tree that had started on the day of pentecost the word of god that was planted on the day of pentecost through the ages a roman bug through doctrine through creeds and ideas had eaten away at that bride tree and even 33 years the prophet said jude jude who sees the condition of the people jude cross because he sees something as lacking he sees maturity as lacking he sees the concern of the people is lacking he says we should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints that's only 33 years after the day of pentecost here we are some 2000 years he sold the prophet of god he knew that god was going to restore that church that bride and so him with his eagle eyes he could look down and see where men had left the leadership of the holy ghost and went after man and personalities and where that roman bug the same insect in four stages of his life that's right let's go over to the book of joel chapter one joel chapter one in joel chapter 1 starting at verse 1 the word of the lord that came to joel the son of petanel hear this ye o man give here all your inhabitants of the land had this been in your days or even the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the palmer worm hath left had the locust eaten and that which the locust has left had the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm has left half the caliper eaten this is the same self insect only in four different stages he's been eating he at that time he began to eat away brother branham said the fruit of that tree because it does listen now it doesn't matter how much bark you have if that bark doesn't grow and produce branches and branches leaves and leaves fruit then it's to no avail right i mean you planted this apple tree so it's a that's a great apple tree there looks good and sturdy and strong but it's harvest time and we ain't got one apple off this tree that's why it was planted to bring forth apples or to bring for fruit and so brother branham said that worm began to eat off the fruit the fruit is the manifestation of the word in the day which you live because that fruit comes from the vine and it's the vine that energized the branches and the branches bear forth fruit but we see through the ages as the prophet said the denominations had grafted their organization in and the message blasphemous names they grafted their their branches in but god said i will chop them off because they are a misrepresentation of the original vine right and they couldn't produce christ they could produce a form of godliness right i was waiting on you to come bro thank you so much he got me up here looking like astronaut oh i am an astronaut thank you god bless you you're ahead i'm the head astronaut thank you so much [Laughter] listen now so the prophet knew he said now the prophet prophetically he could see this he said now this insect has eaten off the fruit and then after a while it began to eat the leaves the fellowship and then after a while it began to eat the bark satan knows what he's doing because god said this is my army i sent this among them see he sent them amongst them but listen there should have been a ministry in the land that would have combat that beast i'm talking about this day now there should have been a ministry that could stand with the discernment of the end time message and discern the two spirits and say this beast it's an insect it's a roman beast but it it but then it began to eat away at the bark that's the doctrine and then after the bart they begin to eat away suck the very life all the way down to a stomp brother random say all the way to a stomp brother branham says in this message here the message is the restoration of the broad tree he says now listen closely now there was listen now don't miss this now there were four messenger four death messengers or would you rather we should close would you rather this morning congress says no he says now listen real close now look there was four four death messengers kill that tree that's right congregation says amen what was it the palmer worm the locusts the cat cankle worm caterpillar is that right amen four messengers of roman devils dogmas killed that tree one took its fruit one took its bark or took its leaves and one took its bark and one took the life is that right amen four messengers of dogmas kill the tree all but the roots and if for messenger of death kill the tree four messengers of life restores the tree now let me let me stop and say this we live in a very intellectual age i mean we do people are very intellectual people know many things and if they don't know what if you don't know you know if you don't know something what do you do you google it you google it and then you then you come back like you know it said yeah i'll tell you what it is say i know what you're saying i googled it too we saying the same thing listen now so with the intellectual mind satan has stepped into this message because he is intellectual that's right and he knows a lot and he knows that if he can get you to deviate just one iota then he got you you know he don't care about you coming to church he don't care about you reading the ball he don't care about you reading the quotes you don't care about that but at the end of the day he wants you to rest upon reasoning right and what you think it ought to be said well brother dale we believe this well it doesn't matter what you believe it's what god's word said let me say like it doesn't matter what brother andre believes god will always perform his word and brother brown says the wheels of prophecy turn slow the cogs of prophecy turn slow but sure amen god will perform what he said he would perform he will interpret it but in this intellectual age that we live in man has conceptions i think it's this way i think it's this way i think it ought to be that way god listen any of that will be in the rapture none of that will be transformed that will be left here that's right but satan is trying to move us away from the vindicated word of a prophet and that prophet god took him around the world took him to south africa took him to india bombay there in india he he brother been there the whole day jane sheeks uh hindu all of them standing before him saying jesus is this and he's not and mohammed is the true brother man listen to that he listened all day to that and then say a word but when it came time for the showdown and he said now you bring me your worst one up here and you bring your gods see which one can give this man his sight god challenged the ignorance of that right and who produced they didn't produce nothing all their fancy speeches all their fancy sermons all their into all their dogmas all all their psychology what did it produce nothing we don't want to find ourselves in that situation in the time of the rapture we don't want to find that we're leaning on some conception we want to know we're standing on the vindicated truth that god will not deny because he will not deny his word how can the holy ghost who wrote the word deny himself he cannot deny himself and he's not going to deny himself in the victory of the bride because the bride is going to stay with that word why because god made her like that god made you the way he wants you he leads you the way he wants to he interprets his word to you not a private interpretation he interprets that word by bringing that word to pass in your life right and so so so what happened they could do nothing and brother brown said now jesus christ gives this man his sight then will you believe him you know the story we've read it's been preached the man received a sign and the people broke their idols like the little deity mark thing on their face and brother i'm saying i'm so sad i have nowhere to send these people to and then god didn't just stay with that brother branham came back to the united states the intellectual giants of the world doctors of divinity great men of scholar hebrew and the greek aramaic men who who with calming words brother brown said now i know y'all got a trick set for me what were you saying brother andrew i'm saying god challenged the ignorance and the intellect of this world and it could not produce but when god said he was going to do something he does it right he fulfills his word and those that hold on to that word and live true to that word will benefit from that word why because listen now because from that word god starts to open up eternal life and lead his children to a higher order a higher dimension in the word that intellect can never come to amen god does that this is not tree of knowledge good and evil this is tree of life and that's why the prophet god said that's the true knowledge good and evil its branches could only grow out so far and then it had to revert back but the tree of life continues continues and it continues to lead his children because god said i'm going to restore that tree and he has done that through malachi 4 through the prophetic he has restored it and brought the word down to his little elected bride she is the very delight of his heart and that's who you are that's what the attraction that's drawing you to the word the very mind of god and you have become the prophet's prophecy because what he prophesied this bride will be this thus this thus she is that and she receives that word and says lord thank you lord i'm that she was elevated by the process of marriage to the word the word brought her look at this morbidish woman called ruth ruth made a decision ruth had character god's looking for character she had character not like orfa orpha who's a moabitess you know the story of ruth that's the day we're living in the great boaz the kinsmen's redeemer and we see ruth right and an author their husbands have died and naomi we got three churches here three women three churches the prophet said the orthodox jew the the the the the elected broad ruth an orpha the denominational laodicea represented but ruth displayed her character right gloria because when the word was presented to her she said naomi i'm going to go with you to your people god looking at character and orpha said i'm going to stay with you also and after a while they started off they all three started off that's right they all started off in this day and in 1906 when the laodicea aids came into existence god pouring out the holy ghost of azusa street wanted to lead that church but after a while that roman insect that that roman insect still alive today i'm not preaching a history that thing's still eaten away today in people's lives say well i remember i was this and i remember but what about now though what about now my brother what about now what what where are we at now where where where's our spiritual growth at now where are we at uh spiritually speaking now so we're growing with the word that's what we should be doing too we're staying with this word that's what god wants to see because god said i'm going to do this and that broad holding to that word she said roof said now i'm going to stay with you naomi where you go i'll go your people is going to be look look at this character i read the history root listen and and brother wade preached a wonderful masterpiece on the book of ruth the jews say at that time that ruth character was so high ruth's character was so special that it even made the orthodox jewish sisters bow their head because of the character and the wisdom and the steadfastness right of her of ruth but what happened to orpha started out too and then you know what you know naomi said said orphan go back go back to your gods plural you know the story she went back because there was nothing in her her election her election drew her back just like her great-great-grandmother so who's her great-great-grandmother lot's wife lot's wife was her great-great-great-grandmother and her great-great-grandmother billy graham and oral roberts say leave this city or two angels went and said leave this city blinded the people to the door but god showing mercy on lot said take your family get out don't turn back all right and lord's wife brother branham said she she didn't do a she didn't just just you know do a a 180. she just slightly looked back just slightly looked back that's right and that caused a man who would have been polycarp who would have been a church age messenger it's a polycarp but the prophet said he leaned slightly an iranian organization that iranis was given that position so when she came out lot's wife didn't turn all the way she slightly turned and the prophet said she turned in the right now that's right so her great great great granddaughter orpha when she said i'll go too i'll go with ruth and naomi she started off a while then the next thing she started thinking man i remember i used to cut my hair man what styles they got today what situation my what church we had then no we don't have well brother dale preaches don't worry but we need some wildfire sometimes how do you know how far just stay with the word because i will restore saith the lord amen so what happened ruth who god saw character because she was steadfast even it's a it's a tremendous thing that even the ministry could not talk ruth into returning because naomi tried her best to tell ruth go back rules come to your people you have nothing here you these are strangers to you this is a strange religion we believe in jehovah and all this you have nothing in that even even naomi could not preach and make ruth turn back that tells me that no backslid preacher can make a true believer go back no way because it's in you and god placed that and by your new birth it draws you by representation it calls you and god draws you draws you to himself he sees that character and you're showing character i'm going to stay there god and god gave her trials but she stood there she had to after making that decision she had to labor a while the prophet said but after she labored a while the boaz the great boaz come into the field and saw her and she went from laboring to resting she said ruth rest and she went from rest to being rewarded and she bore a son named obed and obed jesse and jesse david now the jewish history says that when orpha went back she married also and bore children and her children children and it produced who goliath and ruth's offspring met orpha's offspring and david killed goliath that's right because they stayed with the word and god loves that because that shows the character of who you are shows what's in you what god has called you for raised you up for position and place you in your inheritance and you're standing there the prophet said four messengers four death messengers ate her down but four messengers of life would bring her back through luther uh luther wesley and through pentecost but he said then it went to the word it went to malachi 4. said brother andre we all believe that prophet i'm talking about the prophet's prophecy because the prophet's prophecy was the holy ghost telling the prophet pick up a pen and write that god was going to bring abroad and she would be an invincible a super race of people that's right and she would believe god's word she would be put to places of challenge and god would challenge her and she would respond accordingly directly answering the mind of god his brother said always wondered hell moses could tell god a better way to do things and he said then i realized it wasn't moses it was christ in moses and now the bride who is the amen of the scripture who is the very mind of god who is the inn of all types and shadows when it comes to the mind of god there's a bride in the earth that's been restored by god believing god and he has united himself with her and he has restored her back right to a position and no one's going to take that from her glory that's right that's who you are you're not going to fall you are not predestinate the fall you predestined to be conformed to his image you predestinate speak god's word and believe it and expect it to come to pass you you predestinate to stand like joshua and destroy the enemy with the sword of the word you predestinate the whole that word hold it in your heart you predestinated to move out and step on unbelief and put it under your feet and said that's not what my husband said that's not what god said this is what he says and this is what i believe and this is who i am and god has done this the one the el ella elohim the god the all-powerful one who is bound by the oath of his word right that's right who will believe him the bride will glory because all the world will be deceived except the bride and we see as we said in this intellectual age i'm closing now we see in this intellectual age that people's intellect and concepts have tried to trump the word of god right people know more than brother randomly there they don't mind telling you that they they know a better way than brother brown said well brother brown well brother branham said what he meant amen we don't need to correct the prophet but people around the message believe they can correct the prophet where's every indication right they have no vindication they don't even know what vindication means right right they don't they they don't even know the word it's just some ambition they have someone trying to be greater than someone else someone's trying to know more than someone else that's not even about it that's not this message ain't that it's christ it's eternal life it's the person of the word united with his elected bride glory and god moving you bringing you into a position you're standing there under the expectation of the word of god saying lord i don't move unless i have thus saith the lord and the message is thus saith the lord and lord it may be old-fashioned but we're going to be old-fashioned they may call me a holy roller then i'm just going to be a holy roller but i'm going to stand there let's read here in joel 2 i'm closing now i thank you for your patience with me this evening but how important it is my brother and sister when we see the things that we're seeing lack of concern about the word i mean really well why would i say that so that that i could make you upset with me why you see you i'm not trying to make you upset but people but my brother says we we got to make stands in these days we we got to shake off things spiritual amnesia all around and people forgetting who they are and and and people's rights because that's what it is the homosexual want their rights the white man wanted his right the black man wanted to drive the yellow man everybody want their rights give me mom an american citizen give me my right i have the right to do this i have the right to do that you do you have that right but the bride under this marriage vow she gave him the key of david and it's not just him having the key of david but it's the position of the key of david what was the key of david that's in a marriage brother branham said and a woman who's veiled like rebecca coming to her isaac in genesis 24 she asked eliezer who is this man and he says this is the man here this is the one upon hearing that she takes her veil and covers herself brother barnum said that represented that she had no head that he was her head so upon the valve the woman that's why a woman wears a veil today it's to show that she is the body and her husband is the head not through legalist law not beating their wives up or chastising them no not through that not through law you know we was downstairs and i couldn't get this tied together i told my wife sweetie hurry up come on so you got to get forget it's what i got to study not through that because before i got married my tie was this short i had the the my shirt was so wrinkled color's wrong this actually happened to me in venezuela when i was preaching in the jungle in puerto rico not in that with animals but in the city of here i am going to the pulpit to preach i'm leaving not the study but i'm leaving brother isaiah's house going up walking over to the church his wife and daughter stopped me brother andre hermano andre auto party party come on question what's going on you cannot wear that tie they actually make me stall over here i got my nose my bible i'm going over to preach they stopped me i actually physically i turn around go back in the house take that psychedelic toff i thought i was living in a hippie generator i took that psychedelic towel she said don't ever wear that to the pulpit bellander i said i thought it was looking good yeah nope no but god knows how to do it my title is good tonight on it but abroad serving the lord by divine love and him saying to her i'm going to take you to dimension i'm going to take you places a human mind can never go i will give you a new heart i will give you a new spirit i'll give you a new body i'll give you a new heaven and new earth i'll give you a future home i'll get a millennium i'll give all of this i will restore you i will do this no man no pope i will restore you back and all the years that this roman bug all the years that the palmer worm and the locusts and the canker worm and the caterpillar have eaten i'm going to restore and i've sent my prophet i will bring you back to the original condition i will bring you back to the original doctrine i will bring you back to the original word and i will do this through the prophetic because i am the son of man and i am the sore of the seed i will sow myself in you i will bring myself forth i will do this and zerubbabel says not by might nor by spirit but by or no or known by my nor about power but by my spirit said the lord i've got to finish reading this right here and then we close in in joel chapter 2 starting at verse 21 fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things be not afraid ye beast of the field for the pastors of the wilderness do spring for the tree bears her fruit that's the broad tree just like jesus said in matthew 24 23 he said learn a parable of the fig tree any bible reader knows that the jewish nation is the fig tree but not only the fig tree she's the fig the olive and the grape that's israel in the scripture but not only will that tree be restored the broad tree will be restored because when naomi went back she took ruth with her in the season of the barley harvest that's right he says now just be not afraid you beast of the field for the pastors of the wilderness do spring for the tree for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then eat children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he has given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the form the rain the former and the latter rain in the same month where is that at brother andre and i saw another mighty angel descending with an open book that's revelation chapter 10. that's your scripture it says now verse 24 and the and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine with wine and oil that's stimulation of revelation that's right that's the harvest of the feast there he says now verse 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god for he had dealt wonderly with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed i'm thankful that god it's not my responsibility and as great a minister as brother dale is it's not his responsibility or brother way but it's god's responsibility to restore that bride tree because he said i will do this how will he do it how is he doing it through brother dale through brother wade through brother gavin through these ministers he is doing it through the prophetic and the bride who is the receiver of the prophetic she is receiving word that's springing up and producing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever a tree that was eaten down to the stomp is now bearing for fruit the leaves are clapping and the word of god has not returned void amen god bless you let us bow our head kind heavenly father lord you told us that you were going to restore the broad by the prophetic word lord and lord we're thankful that as you told peter that day who do men say that ah the son of man and the revelation of these things you would build your church on the anointed word for the hour the christ of the hour and lord we see your words going forth lord with life inspiration breathing as in genesis 2 your scripture says that you breathe life into the nostrils of adam and your prophet said this was nothing human this was eternal life god's own life and lord you have breathed upon us in this last day your breath the inspiration of your word life and life has opened up to us father and you have led us lord from mortal to immortality time has blended with eternity and we have seen it lord and we are witnesses being drawn to a new horizon the breaking of a new day we're thankful that we are that people lord you promised us you would do that father and lord as always you have kept your word oh father we we we exalt you tonight with our lips and our heart father because lord you have positively placed us in a position to receive the word lord to have eyes to see ears to hear lord a place that your word can rest father and as your prophet standing there between the sixth and seventh seal lord calling out abroad chopping out abroad by the word prophesying saying i saw her the vindicated masterpiece i heard a voice said do you want to see the bride i said yes i saw her and your prophet said lord i saw father what he saw in a vision the vision have become flesh lord and we see it lord with our eyes we see the great holy spirit opening that great third pool and these things connected with it lord life connected with the third pool the resurrection connected with the third pool salvation connected with the third pool we see this new dimension lord that no one can enter in because no one can approach your light lord and as jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him oh father you said there will be no impersonations of this and there isn't lord we're thankful father for your amazing grace how sweet the sound and as the song said lord that we were listening to coming out we want to see you lord and you said the world will see me no more but you will see me and father because you have brought us into this hidden life and the curtain of the world the desires have fallen behind us lord all we can see is the bride lord that's all we see is you lord the bride complete in heavenly places the victory that you have desired lord father we just ask lord that you'll bless each and every one that's come out lord you see that their their lives their desires their love lord how they love you lord and how your love has sent to them lord and the great ministry here that has positionally placed this people lord let them know as jesus said in matthew for you there's nothing shall be impossible for you may they move in that fear lord may they feel the warmth of these scriptures lord as your holy spirit lays them out brings them alive bursts them in our soul lord and we feel just like that just like the the the african the negro slave lord who alienated from his homeland but yet he knew he was the son of a king lord and father we feel that in our hearts your leadership of eternal life lord how you have led us lord how you have brought us to this place lord lord no man will have his interpretation in the final in the final fanality of your word to bring abroad to immortality you and you along lord are the life that pulsates in our heart father and lord you have brought these things you brought malachite for and we are the children and we are vindicating that lord by the leadership of your holy spirit then father may the character when we look at ruth lord then we see that ruth was only a type of the antitype of the bride today father we commit all things into your hands we thank you for this wonderful assembly lord and we pray lord that you'll give them the desires of their heart lord offer your honor for your glory lord in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you brother god bless you right there thank you so much amen now we can come and reap the benefits of the message because i believe it don't you i believe the bride is
