[0:00] don't worry Romans 10 everybody had a
[0:05] good week yeah we pitched have a good
[0:07] weekend got brother Ernie with us and
[0:13] the next Sunday remembered brother Dale
[0:15] myself brother Donny will be in Kentucky
[0:22] I'll be preaching about the bollards
[0:23] next Sunday little Willie and we've got
[0:25] a 9-month kitchen acquaintance these
[0:26] sudden you got Bob both services next
[0:29] time then
[0:30] really so means me so we might get back
[0:32] Wayne see if we both all three kill
[0:34] something will probably make me a thief
[0:35] or church service so there's that and
[0:39] Louise's gonna do some screenings think
[0:41] something or I don't wanna go back there
[0:44] no we're coming back lanes they even and
[0:47] they not yes I gotta work those yes
[0:50] we're coming back winds even regardless
[0:52] of what we do look even if we get back
[0:56] at the midnight but I hopefully leave
[0:58] it's lunch and get back just pray the
[1:00] way up safe drips both go to snow
[1:03] Tuesday night so oh it may be a dull a
[1:06] oh I love it oh absolutely
[1:08] that's deer hunt good deer hunt you
[1:11] salmon you see them better they move
[1:15] all right this is chapter 10 verse 1
[1:19] rather than my heart's desire and prayer
[1:21] to God for Israel is that they might be
[1:23] saved no we don't want things for sure
[1:28] he just standing on all April and April
[1:31] now we read that in chapter 9 we'll go
[1:33] back over here
[1:43] I'm going to do this but maybe if we
[1:45] find it we don't find this is fun
[1:51] okay you're going to be ready they know
[1:55] let's go to Israel there's a in Israel
[1:57] by birth there's an Israel by heart
[2:01] where Israel about modern there's a
[2:04] natural Israel but now listen to we got
[2:07] to bring this down because the next seal
[2:09] coming up which would be the fifth seal
[2:11] we have a natural Jew or natural Israel
[2:16] excuse me that's going to be given white
[2:19] roads it's not even safe right
[2:22] okay that's your fifth seal Jew all
[2:25] right and that's the part that yeah we
[2:31] got well we got to put it in you know
[2:32] the way to go so we put it in the way it
[2:34] goes it'll be fine that fifth seal is a
[2:38] wonderful steal and involved a couple of
[2:41] other liens denied sure we go up on the
[2:45] fourth seal after the fourth seal a man
[2:47] he's done but you got to take five six
[2:50] and seven and lap them back into number
[2:53] four right
[2:54] okay v Dixon seven seal has to be in
[2:57] that fourth seal to us now remember
[3:01] that's not to Israel because when we
[3:02] leave the two witnesses start their
[3:07] ministry according to the fifth seal
[3:11] we're reading and then the sixth seal is
[3:14] the two prophets - now remember the
[3:17] seventh seal is Christ himself so we
[3:19] have to get that Christ in the fourth
[3:21] seal because that's Christ himself
[3:23] coming back into Sunday ministry take us
[3:25] out of him
[3:26] but he's gonna also come to the Jews
[3:27] then he's also gonna come to the world
[3:30] he'd also wanna fight for the Jews
[3:33] Michael your prints will read all that
[3:35] when we get to it
[3:36] but there's not all Israel that's Israel
[3:38] so remember Israel my heart desire and
[3:42] prayer to God for Israel is that they
[3:43] might be saved because he's a Jew
[3:46] he wants his nation same but he knows
[3:48] he's not there not because he's going to
[3:50] eject off because of Romans nine
[3:53] we read as it is written behold our
[3:55] lands on a stumbling-stone
[3:56] a rock of offense a new favor believeth
[3:59] on him shall not be ashamed he talks
[4:01] about the Gentiles up here that the
[4:02] Gentiles which followed not after
[4:04] righteousness have attained to
[4:05] righteousness even the righteousness
[4:06] which is by faith all right so it Israel
[4:10] remember will be saved as a nation great
[4:13] yeah hundred forty four thousand boom
[4:17] Gentiles individuals it's always been
[4:21] individual well what's Paul doing here
[4:24] in Romans watch what he's doing for I
[4:25] bear them record that they have a zeal
[4:28] of God
[4:32] obviously they still have a deal of God
[4:35] they read the Torah they do their thing
[4:38] they're waiting wall they got even now
[4:40] hey but they missed the first coming of
[4:45] Christ so they're still working under
[4:50] the law right they're still working on
[4:54] the law keeping the feast days and all
[4:56] these things trying to get the temples
[4:59] that they're trying to get that temple
[5:00] worship back they're trying to get the
[5:01] red heifer they trying to get all these
[5:03] things back because it's repetition to
[5:05] the Jews it's just a repetition right
[5:08] but to Gentile there's not a repetition
[5:11] thing it's by faith we take it by faith
[5:14] that's what promotes that drama come on
[5:16] II last night the Bible study was asking
[5:17] about where Paul's talking about where
[5:22] tongues is not for the unbeliever coming
[5:25] for the believers for the unbeliever
[5:28] prophecies for the believer because I'm
[5:31] speaking to you speaking in tongues
[5:32] every day in your life and below you can
[5:34] speak in tongues everyday life and be
[5:36] born again and you don't do anything
[5:37] from
[5:38] person is lost yeah but if you talk to
[5:41] them about the Lord and give them save
[5:43] then signs do follow believer that's one
[5:45] thing about that's not the signs must
[5:46] follow the believer the signs are not to
[5:49] believe with history
[5:50] the signs are an unbelievable right from
[5:54] bear them record that they have a seal
[5:55] of God but not according to knowledge
[5:57] for they being ignorant of God's
[6:00] righteousness no they didn't know he
[6:03] came they didn't know anything about son
[6:05] of man they they you know he wasn't
[6:07] anything to them really and going about
[6:09] to establish their own righteousness
[6:11] what do the log do the Torah don't do
[6:14] this don't do that don't do this don't
[6:15] do that that's why I'm telling you we've
[6:19] made this messy iboga Ruth do this don't
[6:24] do that you can't do this you can't do
[6:26] that do this yeah what we made it we
[6:28] made it ten commandments of the message
[6:30] don't cut your hair you know don't don't
[6:33] wear pants
[6:34] no go man to have long hair but same
[6:36] thing and we've lived by that for years
[6:39] and it got us nowhere
[6:40] right no way you're just doing like
[6:45] Jesus said you're just painting the tomb
[6:48] that you got the dead prophets in and
[6:51] you do want to put them in there okay
[6:56] for they being ignorant of God's
[6:58] righteousness and going about to
[7:00] establish their own righteousness have
[7:02] not submitted themselves unto the
[7:04] righteousness of God see for Christ
[7:07] that's the whole problem they didn't
[7:09] know anything by Jesus Christ coming oh
[7:12] yeah something was there knew he was
[7:14] there but they just did man you know and
[7:16] all that but not the Messiah they didn't
[7:19] think it was a messiah for Christ is the
[7:22] end of the law for righteousness to
[7:25] everyone that look at that word believe
[7:27] ends up ongoing believe it Christ is the
[7:32] end of the law for righteousness to
[7:34] everyone that believeth how is he at the
[7:37] ends of the law to get born again you're
[7:41] not under the law if you're not born
[7:43] again you are under the law that says
[7:46] do this and don't do that but when
[7:49] you're a Christian you don't have one
[7:50] cuz look we're not we're not judged I've
[7:52] already went through what I went through
[7:53] all that you can't judge a Christian you
[8:00] can you touch my soul my soul is not
[8:02] just as eternal as done in theater
[8:05] yes what we were talking about last
[8:07] night the Bible study I want everybody
[8:09] to understand that we've got Jesus doing
[8:12] one thing and that's doing another we've
[8:14] become tunas we're not winning this and
[8:17] we're not chanting no that's wrong
[8:19] programs here but what about it in the
[8:21] middle in the middle growth around their
[8:23] brand so tunas right he brought true one
[8:26] with the starter next Brides in a
[8:28] multiple form but if you and I say well
[8:32] I know I have the I want to be like God
[8:37] I'll read your script for what Satan
[8:39] says he wants to be like daughter and
[8:41] this age he is like doc yeah he is like
[8:44] God
[8:44] he's our closest name to God brother
[8:49] Branson outside of creation he's just as
[8:51] equal to God he just can't create he
[8:53] can't create something he has to take
[8:55] something that's why the prefer go he
[8:57] takes what's already been created and
[8:59] perverts it yes right for Christ is the
[9:02] end of the law for righteousness to
[9:03] everyone that believe it now why did
[9:05] they say believe it thank you a perfect
[9:09] man and all these system remember when
[9:14] you first got born again you were
[9:16] illegal you were a law keeper just like
[9:20] I said you had the ten commandments of
[9:21] the message you know I won't give
[9:22] refrigerator thou shalt not thou shalt
[9:25] not thou shalt not go to denominations
[9:27] thou shall I cut your hair there seven
[9:29] right right but Christ is the end of the
[9:33] law for Reisman for every one day gone
[9:34] that keeps going every one that keeps
[9:38] going on why because now
[9:40] don't have to tell myself every day to
[9:42] keep my hair short I don't have to tell
[9:45] myself every day to go to church I don't
[9:47] have to tell Jeunet get up every morning
[9:48] now you make sure you don't put on a
[9:50] pair pants now let's see all that's
[9:51] that's law you know but that law has
[9:56] become righteousness if you keep it
[9:58] because we're the only people bless you
[10:00] they can keep the Ten Commandments you
[10:01] okay when you get close to 60 then paint
[10:04] remember our over 60 weight straight
[10:11] c'mon straight get the stricken in age
[10:13] she's well cooking tonight last night we
[10:17] had a conversation of well what was well
[10:19] stricken in age because I wonderful
[10:21] brother Lewis brought up the point that
[10:23] Elizabeth that Burke John the Baptist
[10:26] Bible says she was well stricken in age
[10:28] so we were wondering what well stricter
[10:31] than aid was I told him I said if you're
[10:33] 20 40 is well strict in the name if
[10:36] you're 40 60 is well stricter than age
[10:38] if your seats the 80th well thinking the
[10:40] name if you're 18 you're just gold
[10:43] I told my sister cleaning me in 92 you
[10:47] know what is she what she looking at to
[10:49] be welcome no she said I am well there's
[10:53] nobody to push it to once you get up in
[10:55] the 90 you know there's not many left
[10:57] yeah man told me one time he said oh he
[11:00] said I don't have any friends anymore
[11:01] after a while mr. Hodge he said well
[11:03] maybe for them all about the Christ at
[11:08] the end of the law for righteousness to
[11:09] everyone that believeth so it's an
[11:11] ongoing thing you keep going through to
[11:14] meet it to me to keep this message lined
[11:16] up there's no one you got your
[11:17] born-again a lot of times what happened
[11:20] this is we beat the flesh make put them
[11:22] under the ten commandments of a law of
[11:24] the message and we keep them there and
[11:26] then look what's happening now we've
[11:28] come through this journey this period of
[11:31] time and watch them how they're falling
[11:33] away well you can't have the Holy Ghost
[11:35] and fall away we can't read in Hebrews
[11:37] you can't you can't get the baptismal
[11:39] whole goes to lose it okay so you can't
[11:42] turn the message down
[11:43] I say I don't understand it you might
[11:45] get a spirit on you that like brother
[11:48] Ramsay
[11:49] but brother Brown you know where he went
[11:51] out and started drinking beer now let's
[11:53] see that's the spirit same thing with
[11:55] with suicides and stuff like that I'm
[11:57] glad we got a prophet they told us that
[11:59] all that separated we have a lot of
[12:01] spirit of soul your soul just as eternal
[12:03] as God you can't touch it it's not
[12:05] enough one day and down the neck but the
[12:07] Satan can get in that spirit realm give
[12:08] you a spirit and you can do a lot of
[12:10] things now you won't do it long if you
[12:13] won't be long that grantee guy did live
[12:15] with like six months brother Ron said
[12:17] God took him home so he wouldn't Mark's
[12:19] name why he's not going to continue
[12:21] unless somebody keep doing these things
[12:22] he's going to stop it yes to preserve
[12:26] the I have always said that when brother
[12:29] Branham when the angel told him said
[12:31] don't smoke drink or flew around with
[12:33] women because you have a work to do now
[12:36] listen he told all of us that I mean
[12:42] thank you less right to do it him not
[12:44] know but God was protecting not William
[12:47] Branham he was protecting the gift that
[12:49] he had because if not he was a respecter
[12:53] of persons he was not a respected person
[12:54] he come to each one of us listen we all
[12:57] get convicted don't smoke don't drink
[12:59] don't fool around women listen we've all
[13:01] kind of got in that terrible category
[13:02] somewhere along the line so and we could
[13:05] have turned it down just like he did but
[13:07] God was protecting that gift that
[13:09] William Brown had that he could take it
[13:11] to the nation's and be safe here and
[13:16] clean ain't still center okay but he
[13:19] protected the gift from Moses described
[13:22] as the righteousness which is of the law
[13:24] in commandment that the man which do it
[13:27] those things shall live by them but the
[13:30] righteousness which is the faith
[13:32] speaketh on this wise saying not in
[13:36] thine heart who shall ascend from heaven
[13:38] that is to bring Christ down from above
[13:42] because truly the 10 commandments didn't
[13:44] bring Christ to the people I'm from
[13:46] Israel no it did brother brown said that
[13:51] was godly reform but what they do they
[13:53] said no we don't want that we want Moses
[13:55] to talk to the Train okay okay that is
[13:58] to bring Christ down from above or this
[14:03] yo this end in the deep that is to bring
[14:05] up Christ again from the dead but what
[14:09] saith in the word is nigh thee even in
[14:14] thy mouth and the heart that is the Word
[14:17] of Faith which we preach so that's where
[14:19] it is that if thou shalt confess with
[14:22] thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[14:25] believe in thine heart that God had
[14:27] raised him from the dead thou shalt be
[14:29] saved
[14:30] now they had nothing to do with the law
[14:35] Doosan don't if you're waiting to get
[14:38] good enough to get saves you know the
[14:39] whole thing the devil says you ain't
[14:40] doing them that's the first thing you'll
[14:41] take first thing you told me you're not
[14:43] good another thing and you know what I
[14:45] agreed with it that's right and I came
[14:47] home to church you got rid of my greed I
[14:50] said no I'm not right I said but saying
[14:53] you can't stop me from being saying I
[14:55] stopped myself
[14:58] thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[15:00] Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine
[15:02] heart that God raised him from the dead
[15:04] thou shalt be saved
[15:05] for with the heart man believeth unto
[15:07] righteousness raid justification is an
[15:12] act of righteousness but it's not total
[15:16] righteousness
[15:17] it's an act of the Holy Ghost but it's
[15:18] not the whole ago if you be justified
[15:20] every day in your life and I go hey you
[15:22] be sanctified every day and heal
[15:23] happened I go do you have the Holy Ghost
[15:24] on your spirit anointing you and I go to
[15:27] hell but you can't have it in your heart
[15:29] not this thing
[15:31] is your Center being your center self
[15:33] yes all right for with the heart man
[15:36] believeth unto righteousness because
[15:38] remember there's the paradox is that
[15:42] you're living in an unbelievable world
[15:46] shrinking that you can take that to
[15:47] waste an out the leaving world in an
[15:50] unbelievable world
[15:51] I mean we've come down to a place where
[15:55] brother joke told me that was a dog shot
[15:56] a man the other day
[15:58] well the doll was fooling around in the
[16:00] backseat of the drove me get the shotgun
[16:02] and went off and did we got Goss
[16:07] Tennessee good still he's still a good
[16:08] dog us he's a good shot I let him hide
[16:14] retreat but you see all the weird stuff
[16:17] is going on me we got a weird stuff
[16:19] happening everywhere because man's mind
[16:24] when the Bible said that it wasn't the
[16:26] days of Noah man's mind were what
[16:27] continually evil everybody's all got an
[16:31] angle now everybody man look at this the
[16:33] living I don't want to bring it up I'm
[16:35] going through for a second look at all
[16:36] this political junk is going on man
[16:38] they know you stood that Swingle mud at
[16:40] each other I'll shoot know that fire
[16:43] nuclear weapons with each other now let
[16:44] me there there you know your grandma was
[16:48] oh yeah but you know why is because
[16:54] man's that were built into something you
[16:57] and I are build and that's why I'm
[16:58] telling you you and I are building to
[16:59] something that's not part of this world
[17:00] you and I are building something here
[17:04] it's going to take us into another
[17:06] dimension and then they're just going
[17:07] you know what they program
[17:09] dog-eat-dog that's what's gonna happen
[17:10] this world is gonna be a pitiful place
[17:13] when there's no grace left when there's
[17:16] no grace left it's gonna be a pitiful
[17:18] place to be but we're trying to escape
[17:20] that for the heart with a heart the man
[17:22] believeth unto righteousness
[17:23] with the mouth confession is made unto
[17:25] salvation well the scripture saith
[17:28] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[17:31] ashamed for there is no difference
[17:35] between the Jew and the Greek
[17:37] he's telling them there's no difference
[17:39] then you know what the Jews are doing
[17:41] they're standing there going he's our
[17:42] guy everybody else is going noise I rock
[17:45] no these don't know any harder ok but
[17:50] let God be God yes ok let God begun
[17:54] there's no different when using the
[17:56] Greek for the same lord over all is rich
[17:58] unto all that call upon him what's Paul
[18:01] trying to do he's trying to get that
[18:02] division out of the way so they think
[18:04] that come together just like you know
[18:07] you you shadow Paul's ministry and
[18:09] brother rounds ministry they pretty much
[18:11] all happened kind of the same because it
[18:13] was the awful Alpha prophet and brother
[18:16] Brennan was the Omega prophet you had
[18:18] your two in books that had to be
[18:19] basically the same Hall came with the
[18:22] independent office we brought as
[18:23] mentioned for the ramp Remington and
[18:24] penticoff brothers message how old
[18:26] struck down by a life brother Graham
[18:28] that last his whole life you know so we
[18:30] see these things that they're parallel
[18:32] so what's he doing now he's trying to
[18:36] bring them together brother branham
[18:38] really did trying to bring the
[18:39] Pentecostals and the baddest and the
[18:41] Methodists and bring them together not
[18:43] the way they wanted to come together
[18:44] that was the problem because that's why
[18:46] they cut him out come and walk to they
[18:52] wander this new doctrine that this
[18:53] probably
[18:57] because there was divisions back then I
[18:59] mean there wasn't denominations back
[19:01] then but there were divisions all the
[19:03] time I think it's wolves he said coming
[19:05] in for whosoever shall call upon the
[19:07] name of the Lord shall be saved how then
[19:10] shall they call on him and who have them
[19:12] they have not believed so there's got to
[19:15] be a believing that this Jesus did what
[19:17] he did you can't just say Jesus to these
[19:20] people that I've heard say that out of
[19:21] the world and it didn't have nothing to
[19:22] do with right right so there's not if
[19:28] you go wild all you gotta do is cry say
[19:30] labor geez no there's something behind
[19:32] that it's knowing who he is and what's
[19:36] behind all that then how shall they call
[19:38] on him and who they have not believed
[19:40] and how shall they believe in him of
[19:42] whom they have not heard and how shall
[19:46] they hear without a preacher all right
[19:49] and how shall they preach except they be
[19:51] simple there's a lot of stipulations
[19:54] going on here
[19:55] as it is written how beautiful are the
[19:58] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[19:59] peace and bring glad tidings of good
[20:01] things but they have not all obeyed the
[20:05] gospel for Isaiah said Lord who has
[20:07] believed our report in other words it's
[20:10] not these unbelievers so then faith
[20:13] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[20:17] Word of God but I say have they not
[20:21] heard question yes barely their sound
[20:25] went into all the earth and their words
[20:27] unto the ends of the world in other
[20:30] words the gospel is being preached the
[20:32] gospel is being put out there all over
[20:34] the world right I mean look at it now
[20:37] you say well you know 50 years ago it
[20:41] was pretty much brother branham's
[20:42] message home 7-inch real and absolutely
[20:49] you could not put him on that wall right
[20:52] there all 11 our sermons cuz it was 1100
[20:55] and some of them had to
[20:56] some of that retail for one let
[20:58] spoken-word revision seating have like
[21:00] three tapes three of the big seven eight
[21:04] through training through whichever one
[21:06] one anyway what I'm saying is that would
[21:08] be hard to go into all the world wind
[21:10] but I got a whole message right
[21:15] oh my phone that does all these oh say
[21:17] thousands of things right so I can take
[21:20] the gospel and I even have the voice so
[21:24] I can say I can listen to it in this and
[21:26] I can take this all over the lid off
[21:30] you've been preached all over plus we
[21:32] got internet there words words unto the
[21:37] ends of the world
[21:39] we got in tape form we got in book form
[21:41] and sent all over the world but I say
[21:50] have they not heard yes better than
[21:52] they're selling all the earth into word
[21:53] from the end of the world but I say did
[21:56] not Israel no first Moses said I will
[22:01] provoke you to jealousy by them that are
[22:03] no people and by foolish nation I will
[22:07] anger you who was that that was he right
[22:11] right but Isaiah it's very bold and said
[22:16] I was found of them that sought me not i
[22:20] was made manifest unto them that asked
[22:22] not after me and what's he saying this
[22:24] is the gentile because listen the jews
[22:27] were looking for christ they were
[22:29] looking for the Messiah and there he is
[22:33] he came for him but I was found of them
[22:38] that sought me not Gentiles or the
[22:40] seeking Christ they worse
[22:41] didn't even know anything about God
[22:43] sending nobody to say I was made
[22:49] manifest unto them that asked not after
[22:51] me
[22:53] in other words what's Paul saying he's
[22:56] saying that I have come to talk to you
[22:57] Romans but you Romans been causing me to
[22:59] come tell you about this but I'm coming
[23:02] to bring you a gospel watching us in
[23:05] Israel he said all day long I am
[23:07] stretched forth my hands unto a
[23:09] disobedient and gainsaying people God is
[23:13] long-suffering because man look what
[23:16] Israel did according person looking for
[23:18] difficulty I say then hath God cast away
[23:22] his people god forbid he has not cast
[23:24] him away now he put him away he put him
[23:29] away
[23:29] he was married to Israel and he put them
[23:31] away and give him
[23:33] divorce man but he won't forget them
[23:37] watch Brian I also AM an Israelite of
[23:41] the seed of Abraham of the tribe of
[23:43] Benjamin
[23:43] now here comes Paul showing his natural
[23:46] image God hath not cast away his people
[23:53] though which he foreknew which is his
[23:56] peace children what you not that the
[23:59] scripture said of a lot how he maketh
[24:02] intercession to God against Israel
[24:04] saying Lord they have killed thy people
[24:07] and digged down thine altars and I am
[24:10] left alone and they seek my life now
[24:12] that was new Elijah he lies it's Elijah
[24:16] remember Elijah went back in the cable
[24:18] said God I'm the only one left then
[24:20] another person in the whole nation
[24:23] that's not bow down to this bale God
[24:27] gifting shows him 7,000 men go back in
[24:30] description read it
[24:32] Lord they've killed thy prophets and
[24:34] digged down thine altar and I have left
[24:36] alone and they seek my life but what
[24:38] saith the answer of God unto him I have
[24:40] reserved to myself seven thousand men
[24:42] God is always gonna have somebody even I
[24:47] think maybe brother Branham would
[24:49] standing though I'm alone because
[24:52] remember he always how I stood by myself
[24:53] then on the seals he really did go he
[24:56] said thousands of my friends and when he
[24:58] preached marriage and divorce he sent
[24:59] thousands of 1,000 to my friend will
[25:02] leave me and they did and he pretty much
[25:05] like Jesus he died alone everybody was
[25:08] against him there I mean he was
[25:09] preaching it to 50 thousand people and
[25:11] then he preached to 50 when he preached
[25:15] the rapture message in Yuma Arizona he
[25:17] was preaching in them in a house trailer
[25:19] was about 50 feet 30 to 50 people there
[25:22] and he preached the rapture message so
[25:25] what he did he I don't think brother
[25:30] Adam in his own self
[25:32] cut himself off from the people the
[25:35] people cut him off because they couldn't
[25:37] understand that doctrine and then they
[25:39] could they will turn that doctrine down
[25:40] that's right and brother Branham
[25:43] probably even right before he died he
[25:45] thought won the world my lord I'm out
[25:46] here all by myself he went to Arizona
[25:49] and said I've been out here for three
[25:50] years and not one person asked him to
[25:53] preach now I've been pretty rough you
[25:55] take somebody like William Brown these
[25:57] are being named I mean it my new name
[25:59] and in the fifties they couldn't pack
[26:01] enough to get a building big enough
[26:03] tents big enough to put him in he goes
[26:06] to Arizona till Leo comes got going and
[26:08] go to desert just like he told Moses to
[26:10] go there just like all the way to the
[26:11] day Jesus went to the devil all right he
[26:16] went out there and not one church asked
[26:18] him to preach in three years you know
[26:21] always have to come back though
[26:22] somewhere else or go to Jefferson felt
[26:24] brief so he thought he was alone but
[26:27] thank God I hope he left brother brown
[26:29] look over the banner of time and look
[26:31] down and see all the preachers now that
[26:32] are preaching the true message of the
[26:34] hour not the oh not the bad ones but the
[26:36] preaching the true message of the hour
[26:38] collect what he done with a lie these
[26:40] and now lie do you may look alone but I
[26:43] got 7,000 men that I have preserved that
[26:46] have not bowed the knee to the image
[26:48] available and that helped Elijah because
[26:50] the lines of the human man remember the
[26:52] Bible said the live in his black passion
[26:54] man like meeting you yeah all right so
[26:56] he had complexes like we have complex he
[27:00] was setting a period of ten in them and
[27:02] he was setting up there in that can
[27:04] going Lord what why do you want you I'm
[27:09] the only one left then another one they
[27:12] didn't all give this out to bill God
[27:14] coming self and said no I got I don't
[27:17] have their seven I don't have just 700 I
[27:20] got seven thousand men they have not
[27:23] been that Bowser need to bail so in
[27:25] other words they're out there
[27:27] condemning bail and preaching the gospel
[27:30] what we're saying this
[27:33] even so then at this present time also
[27:37] there is a remnant according to the
[27:39] election of grace no once he tell them
[27:41] it may look bad
[27:43] Paul are you the only one no same as
[27:48] that a remnant according to the election
[27:50] of grace and by grace then it is no more
[27:54] worse
[27:55] otherwise grace is no more grace right
[27:57] grace is not grace if you put words in
[27:59] it this way all right basic beat them
[28:03] works there is no more grace otherwise
[28:05] work is no more if I understand that
[28:10] works is what I told you ten
[28:12] commandments on your refrigerator every
[28:13] day you know I don't do this I don't
[28:15] mean this don't remember
[28:17] that's what to reach on loser did when
[28:19] he come to Jesus Jesus said if you kept
[28:21] the commandments he said from my youth
[28:23] as a child I've not broken any of them
[28:26] Ten Commandments right
[28:27] do you said well can you sell all you
[28:29] goods and that's what got because he put
[28:33] it all on work yes there wasn't enough
[28:36] grace in that rich young ruler to
[28:38] believe what Jesus told him if you'll
[28:41] sell everything you've got you know what
[28:43] Jesus was telling you really he was not
[28:44] saying something he got to be a poor man
[28:47] he said if you'll sell everything you
[28:49] got walk with me I'll give you eternal
[28:51] life and I'll do like I did go I'll
[28:53] multiply everything you got that was the
[28:55] party didn't get the retail ruler didn't
[28:58] get that part well how come you couldn't
[29:00] step up cause I was telling you that it
[29:04] is by grace and not worked because this
[29:09] is the big it's not in a message so much
[29:10] but out there the number links in the
[29:12] world ball says always cast by grace and
[29:14] not by works then you go over reboot
[29:16] James James said by work so and then so
[29:20] brother Brown comes up and preaches what
[29:22] works his faith expressed pleased to
[29:28] sermon works this faith and it explains
[29:30] every bit of it that it's not about
[29:33] works that you're saying but because
[29:36] you're saying you don't work
[29:38] our problem is the pentecostal said okay
[29:41] you do the works and look at the gray no
[29:44] gives a grace and then do the work okay
[29:47] that's to me that's pretty simple
[29:50] yeah if you just go about work so
[29:53] there's no grapes because if you go
[29:56] about works then you take brother Ramsay
[29:58] and you put him in hell yeah right
[30:02] that brother Ram John was telling you
[30:04] about if we look at it said okay don't
[30:08] go don't drink don't smoke dope cuz but
[30:10] run around you know we got a list I'm
[30:12] gonna for frigerator and they see by the
[30:14] remedy out drinking a cold beer they did
[30:18] got girl we see that we go through XM
[30:21] off because of his works we didn't see
[30:25] the Grayson then though the grace of God
[30:27] is going to cook him home okay
[30:29] keeping right okay done all right until
[30:32] that's the same way with you and I works
[30:34] is faith expressed exactly what then I
[30:39] have to go up with mother and infant a
[30:41] minute what there is will have not
[30:43] obtained that which he seeketh for you
[30:48] got that Israel have known obtained
[30:49] Israel is still 10 commandments works
[30:52] Moses Torah right and they seek for it
[30:57] what and they've obtained nothing it's
[31:00] got on nowhere but the election hath
[31:03] obtained it and the rest were blinded
[31:06] what the elect let's see what that
[31:09] signal it says the elect has obtained it
[31:16] and the rest were blinded now he's
[31:19] interpolating see it doesn't cook I mean
[31:22] no hey Porter them things best days
[31:25] thinking according to this written God
[31:28] have given them the spirit of slumber
[31:30] eyes that they see not and ears that
[31:33] they should not hear unto this day
[31:37] Israel and to this day are still blinded
[31:40] by God that's why God give them when we
[31:43] get in the fifth deal that's why God
[31:44] give them eternal life it's because he
[31:46] literally blinded them put his hand over
[31:49] their eyes and says you can't see me
[31:50] right now cuz I got a kid table right I
[31:52] gotta get out and David said let their
[31:57] table be made a snare and a trap and a
[32:00] stumbling block and a recompense them to
[32:01] them let your eyes be darkened on that
[32:03] Israeli that they may not see and bow
[32:06] down their back hallway I say then have
[32:09] they stumbled that they should fall god
[32:14] forbid but rather through their fall
[32:18] salvation has come to the Gentile I just
[32:22] said them rather through their fall
[32:26] salvation has come to the Gentiles for
[32:31] to provoke them to jealousy all right
[32:35] now so they didn't stumble no other day
[32:38] in Istanbul so that like I said this is
[32:39] wasted thing they've not stumbled and
[32:41] guys just kicked them out throw them in
[32:43] the shredder and put them in the trash
[32:44] and they're done with no for a time he's
[32:47] blinded their eyes so that we could come
[32:49] in just having two weeks a day oh you
[32:51] can see that little gap in between
[33:00] all of it anyway so remember Christ came
[33:04] to the Jew or the Oracles of God came to
[33:08] the Jews right so the Oracles of God
[33:13] came to the Jews will they come here to
[33:14] this place and this is the cross now
[33:17] they would accept it Christ all you
[33:19] would have seen was is one more week
[33:21] that would've been your 17 weeks of
[33:23] damage of 69 and 1 but because of me and
[33:27] you blindness in part has come to Israel
[33:33] let his blood be on us and our children
[33:36] God blinded their eyes so that 7 Church
[33:43] ages are a Gentile bride could work
[33:45] their way and when I was he gonna do
[33:46] he's gonna come right back with to
[33:48] witness for one more week to finish the
[33:51] 70 Lisa thing by two prophets cut off in
[33:56] the midst of the week then you know
[33:59] valve Armageddon gonna put us we're
[34:01] gonna come back over here this is what
[34:02] we're coming back but blindness in part
[34:05] is come to Israel or rather through
[34:10] their fall salvation is tongue to the
[34:13] Gentile if I understand that that's the
[34:18] part I like
[34:19] Colette's meet you that's a Gentile
[34:22] Church and that is our box right our
[34:25] inheritance is right thing we don't get
[34:27] this in there yes Israel gets this in
[34:30] there that's right they're having
[34:32] inheritance here two prophets you're
[34:33] going to come save 144,000 guys gonna
[34:36] come down and fight for them Mike will
[34:38] come down and fight if you buy the worm
[34:39] again all this is wiped off and guess
[34:41] what we're all comes back into the
[34:43] Moline okay not some promise
[34:46] so they get a promise they get 70 weeks
[34:49] every Lisa Daniel is a promise to the
[34:51] Gipp to the Jew and all right yesterday
[34:53] I've always said Daniel is the Book of
[34:57] Revelations to the Jews just like our
[34:59] Book of Revelations is to the Gentiles
[35:01] okay and it's intertwined it's
[35:04] intertwined in Revelation
[35:06] but now you look at Daniel that was that
[35:10] was what 70 weeks are determined to save
[35:13] it well he's determined
[35:15] you hear that I'm determined to save
[35:17] Israel because right now they don't want
[35:20] it that's still got the end come yet
[35:23] then the boy when he does three and a
[35:27] half years it took us 2,000 years to
[35:29] understand Christ it's only gonna take
[35:32] them three and a half years to
[35:33] understand that they missed it but you
[35:35] know why it's going to be two prophets
[35:37] just like what they need they need two
[35:40] prophets Moses Elijah - because I don't
[35:43] listen I don't know if live you look
[35:45] around when I preached it but on the
[35:47] five comings of logic
[35:49] the Jews are looking for Elijah has to
[35:52] show up before Christ comes well it is
[35:55] it's number five they just miss number
[35:58] four coming to the Gentile pages coming
[36:00] to us right right but they are looking
[36:02] as soon as Elijah hits the stage over
[36:06] there in Israel they gonna flop to it
[36:08] now there will be some fall away but
[36:11] they're gonna flop right to me and here
[36:12] comes another the spirit of Moses
[36:15] showing the great signs of shutting the
[36:18] heavens up and do it all these things
[36:20] and buddy they're going to preach a
[36:21] powerful sixth seal message it's going
[36:26] to take them out of here and we're gonna
[36:28] have the same thing go six seal finishes
[36:30] prediction we'll get into that
[36:31] later in the sixth seal through their
[36:34] fall salvation has come to the Gentiles
[36:36] / to provoke them to jealousy they have
[36:39] to follow them be the riches of the
[36:41] world and the diminishing of them the
[36:43] riches of the end house how much more
[36:45] than fullness the Jews are like we're
[36:49] rich the Jews are still rich there are
[36:52] filthy rich ok but they don't have the
[36:56] riches of the Gentiles my riches or not
[36:59] the external diamonds and rubies and
[37:01] doing all that knowledge the baptism of
[37:03] the Holy Ghost how much more their
[37:05] phones for I speak to you Gentiles in as
[37:09] much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles
[37:11] I magnify on that office now you'd make
[37:14] 5 selfie magnifiers off if by any means
[37:18] I may provoke to emulation if I know
[37:20] what that word is we're gonna find out
[37:22] what it is right here because it's
[37:23] jealousy for if anybody means I may
[37:27] provoke to jealousy then which are my
[37:29] flesh and might save some of them he's
[37:34] rebuking him it's telling them that
[37:36] Christ has come to the Gentiles my
[37:39] people for if the casting away of them
[37:44] be the reconciling of the world what
[37:46] shall the receiving of them the little
[37:49] life from death he's asking question
[37:51] look for him the first-fruit be holy the
[37:54] lump is also lonely into Ruth be holy
[37:56] so are the branches now watch remember
[37:59] you never grasped it in okay in grafting
[38:04] of the Gentiles way we weren't the truth
[38:06] tree Ezra was the truth tree but Val
[38:13] gentle being a wild olive tree we were
[38:16] Wow oh we're grafted in among them and
[38:20] with them for takis of the root and
[38:23] fatness of the olive tree we get to
[38:27] bless into Israel
[38:29] we now have the blessing to visualize
[38:31] Abraham Isaac Jacob don't all those
[38:33] people we understand that alright I'll
[38:36] have enough to finish this we're gonna
[38:38] go right here and if some of the
[38:40] branches be broken off and thou being a
[38:43] wild olive tree were grafted in among
[38:45] them right here here's a tree here's the
[38:48] tree
[38:49] here's the engrafting this wild olive
[38:52] tree branch was grafted in and it grew
[38:57] and then it's going to be cut because
[39:00] when it's being cut we're going up amen
[39:03] that branch is gonna take rafter but the
[39:06] tree is still going to be growing most
[39:09] not amongst both not amongst the
[39:15] branches but if thou boast thou bear'st
[39:18] not the fruit but the root bears thing
[39:21] that I will say then the branches were
[39:24] broken off that I might be grafted in
[39:26] will work we'll get to verse 20 next
[39:29] week a little mark there right there
[39:30] let's go stick
[39:36] [Music]
