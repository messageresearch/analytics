========================================

[Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy [Music] holy holy amen and amen you want to see him just take a look around he's always right there amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord and our brother russ with us today we had a real good time yesterday fellowshipping talking and everything and just he'll be with us today leaving back out tomorrow so praise the lord bless him as he travels along you know and do it all right uh brother bob is over at brother uh chris shane's preaching today so remember them remember the bible study will be the second or be the first saturday on march remember the fellowship meeting will be the third saturday and let's see that will be in alabama so remember them each one also this afternoon next sunday after the service we will have a little time to kind of cover the offices and things and you won't have to come to the the uh bible study you can we'll just do it yeah if you want to come you can still come we would like for you to do that all right brother boyd's and sister monica's class will be practicing today at 12 45 so remember that any other announcements i always miss a miss one or two or something you know but anyhow all right let's go to our scripture matthew 24. if you notice we're not going to first peter okay now i want to say this just to where everybody's here and thinking i told you i was going to stop the series on at the revelation of jesus christ i didn't say i ended it i didn't say it was done i just brought it to a halt because really technically i had caught up with wade and that there was no need of both of us in the same pattern moving into revelations four five six and all like that so i chose to back out for a little while and uh let him continue on in that to where that he can bring out the things that he sees about the seals etc and things like yeah but don't ever think that we stopped so you keep thinking on one thing now this may strike you and i'll just read the scripture because i thought about doing this today and then when i come back into it after wade moves on a while upward then you'll see we'll drop right back in where we're at after revelation of jesus christ and go right back up to try to catch up with him again because that'll that's the way that it's laying out in what that the way i chose to minister there's a very odd scripture in your bible first corinthians 15 28 and when all things shall be subdued unto him there then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all you'll see us pick up right there and carry on a thought as we're going upward but we're into matthew 24 and then we'll go to leviticus 25 okay may the lord have his blessing father we thank you for everything let your love be with us today and let your light shine in our hearts that we may see you and god each and every one of us we love you and we thank you you promised in your word that you come and heal us and deliver and we believe you have and we ask you to just make it manifest throughout all of the people that lord we can our healings can come our things to where that we know satan's fighting on every hand but yet you promise to raise up a standard we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen 24 32. now learn a parable now if you notice we're right back into the point but listen now learn the parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled now what things heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day an hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until today that noah entered into the ark and you not until the flood came and it took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall be two in the field one should be taken the other left two women grinding one taken one left watch therefore okay now let's go over to leviticus because this is where we'll pick up our thought leviticus 25 and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai i say speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give you you shall then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord now watch what's land people land people okay six years shall not sold i feel in six years shall i prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard that which groweth of its own accord of thine harvest thou shalt not reap it is neither gather the grapes without vine undressed for it is a year of rest unto the land and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and thy stranger that shall join us with in other words everybody's going to participate okay whatever it be within your household all right and for that cattle and for thy beasts that are in the land shall all the increase thereof be meat see you can't go out put your sickle in and harvest to sell or to do but they can just go out and eat what's left you know all right now watch thy shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month now you've stopped your rest of the land now where you're at people and shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of the atonement so you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family now it'll finish on down through the other but you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now you may uh in your studies or thoughts run across the idea because the word there is spell jubal we put it jubilee and it can be either one because it's the same meaning just word that you'll think on these things all right now to me i look at a lot of things on a large scale i guess you'd call it to worry that i try to look at the natural and see what's going on and i try to find the spiritual in that because then by watching the bible the prophet's message the things you can tell the day and hour that you're living you know right where you're at the and you don't have to to be concerned with wondering you know you can read the newspaper as we say you know and it literally is the bible because it's telling you what's taking place all right now what is the bible that we've always talked about how is it that i try to express the bible the bible is a firsthand information it is a present tense it deals with the past but yet in future but yet it's present tense right now so that way the prophet said we look back we look forward fail to see where we're at all right now to then recognizing your day in its message see this message that we read in other words to me i can read a message and and turn over in the newspaper now and read what he's talking about right turn your radio on and you'll hear the very thing that you just heard him expressing on a tape or reading in a book you know and it'll be just right there in front of your eyes to where you can see it it's wonderful because it's present tense is no past in god there is no future the future is not here if you get to tomorrow then tomorrow becomes today so there's no future there's no price we take it as we can follow it throughout our our journey in time and read in the newspaper all right like you remember not too long ago that there was some airplanes flew into some towers and they fell and the bible says that when the towers fall isaiah 30. when the towers fall the sun will be is you know the the moon will be as bright as the sun and the sun will be seven fold which means it's the word coming forth in the day and hour that we're living because it's open that up see that where it'll be showing god in what he's doing and they just flew into those towers and you say well that's that's that's not necessarily what that is well what do you want to make it i mean you think it was an accident that they flew into the towers no it was a pre-planned masterpiece that they were capable of bringing those things to pipes but to me i look at it like well hey that's showing the day that we're living because it says when that happens that the the light of the sun you know the light of this the moon will be as bright as the sun well that's church that's looking at where we're at and what we're doing all right and see looking at those things then you can go over and see we had another little incident happen that back in the times of the watergate you remember that all right and watergate you go back in nehemiah and you think and read about i believe it's nehemiah 8 that they stood before the watergate and read the word they stood for i forgot how many was 11 hours or something a mass great amount of hours that the children of israel stood before the watergate all right and heard the word red well in it odd that this message came at the time of the watergate situation that took place see we should look at things i'm trying to get you to think about looking at things happen that shows it personal to us all right happening in our day that we can read about and know about and understand and see those things coming into being all right so dates and times and seasons you know the bible says stay away from him because he's scared of him but the same god that told us to do that is the god that put it in the word about it so he's not telling us to leave it alone like that it's not it's where to put and and brother dale has been accused of a lot of things but i have never tried to make any prediction of a date of any kind all right now if i can read what brother branham said now who's making the prediction well you're just reading what you want to read well i'll be glad to let you read to me you know whatever you think about of things but see there's things in the bible that that we look at and as we look at it if we take it we could see the very time we're living all right you remember now in matthew about the 20th verse 20th chapter in matthew that an instant took place it speaks of 11th hour worker right all right then it drops down telling about that thou worker that the 11th hour worker gets the same pay all right now so we are the people ending up all things so shouldn't it be said that we're the leaveth our people all right if you don't believe that if they'll pull up number two we'll read it you know we'll pull that up on the screen we'll read number two and see what brother random says about the 11th hour all right taken from that's matthew 20 we're quoting from the seal of god in 1954. he's talking about 11th our people could come in the last calling of the gentiles mother worked our dad and them worked their grandmother worked back there this is our age the 11th hour that the world war stopped on the 11th month the 11th day of the month the 11th hour in the day the 11th minute in the hour that the 11th hour people might come in said what received the same baptism in the holy ghost they did back at the beginning all right world war one ended 11th hour 11th minute nobody knows who stopped what nobody knows what caused it to take place but we were the love with our people that was there so it had a vast meaning to us right you'll hear brother branham say a lot of things like moon turn into blood etc and he'll say i can show you maybe he doesn't do it but he said i can show you where that had a drastic meaning or took place right amen because he would would tell you what the bible is talking about we can take his word for it all right so then we're the leaveth our people we're the people to end up all things and it ended right turn 11 11 11 11 everything you know and i'm so um mindful of dates and times and seasons i guess till when i turn over in the night my clock's right there at me and if i'm over this way i turn over that away and i look at it and it says 11 11. i say hey that's me you know i think about it don't you i think about like the tower's falling i think that means our day i think that the word came before the watergate situation came into being all right i think those things have something to do with us in each day that we live all right present tense something to be with each one of us all right so now are you following me see maybe we need sometimes to look at dates and times and think about it maybe we can see the day that we're living if we'll do that all right see those things has a bearing upon our lives okay we're all associated with this way or that way one or the other all right now are you you're following what i'm getting so a lot of you know where i'm headed anyway so that's all right but we'll we'll get there in a minute now we read the scripture there in matthew and jesus said this generation shall not pass away till all of these things be fulfilled all right now mankind has taught that as being different things uh a lot of the people took it as uh brother brown says it that they misunderstood and they took it as to be saying you know this generation shall not pass away because a generation is 40 years and that they were saying that when titus came into jerusalem in a.d 70 that that was the 40-year generation and that fulfilled that scripture brother brown says no he says no it doesn't all right now watch what we're getting to let's see if we can pick that one up go on with number number five go number four excuse me i'm laying this the thought down to you and then we'll get to our mind thought okay sir as we would see jesus watch what he says jesus said to him there in matthew when you see the fig tree and all the other trees putting forth buds the time is nigh even at the door see israel put forth their trees but what's the other one brought around and explained it that it was the denominations putting forth their bud right israel is the fig tree the denominations is the one putting forth theirs so we see you know let's see it maybe in this one yes and this one when you see the fig tree and all the other trees putting forth butts know the time is now even at the door this generation shall not pass until all be fulfilled just think of it not only was the jews the fig tree to put forth its buds but the other trees now watch him and every church has had a revival and have been for the last few years the pentecostals you've had a revival the baptist has had a revival the presbyterians had got a revival and the jews are returning to palestine this generation shall not pie shall not cease until all be fulfilled a generation in the bible is 40 years enter 12 years and it's already pisces he's talking about may the 6th we'll come back to that in a minute all right but now think about it see this generation shall not pass away i've said a lot here lately about things and a lot of you would say well where'd he get it will i i just invite you to go find out see when we're in the baptist church and the baptist people taught that the year was to end or some great catastrophe was to take place by the year 1988. because they believe that okay and the reason they believe that israel was established as a nation and they believed it see they picked up a little from thinking it was back there with titus 40 years they picked it up and brought it a little higher to understanding that 1948 the reason they used 48 there is a technical argument over the basis of whether israel was established in 46 or 48. some of them say the paperwork was put in all right but the establishment was not to two years later i have no problems with that i listen to the prophet i let him tell me what took place and then i don't have to worry about it all right so now you see that it's very important to follow a a point okay it shall not pass away how the infidel without the interpretation likes to lay on to that see he said this generation not the generation he was talking to the generation that seen the fig tree putting forth his bud see they take that the generation he was talking to would not pisce and that would be titus in a.d 70. all right but he wouldn't talk about that he's talking about when when the people see israel established as a nation all right now when was israel established as a nation he said well what's that got to do with us it's got enough to do with us until brother branham explains it that israel become a nation in on may the 6th in 46 and the angel met him on may the 7th to take the message to the world now that's how much he thought about it that's how much he could explain so we're not arguing whether it's this or 48 or whatever we just i've just made the statements but i want you to see this see we're at the end okay the very night taken from number six if you want to read it questions and answers on genesis the very night the very day that the angel of the lord met me 1946 on may the 7th at green's mill indiana that same day the treaty which was really may the 6th for israel may the 7th it comes over we'll get to that in a minute and when it did it was established israel as a nation and god goes to the world with a message to the prophet he said well times do mean a little bit don't they if we understand what they are but if we just try to make them our own thoughts we wind up in different things go ahead with number seven the greatest gift in the bible returning to the homeland and said he could die in the homeland be buried you know in other words they said that's what he was saying they said no we come to see the messiah don't run over that too lightly they come to see the messiah watch that when we get down if we fly out time to the end of the message part don't run over that lightly they come to see the messiah that's what they were coming for they were coming back to the homeland to see the messiah because that's what they believed all right and he said don't run over that lightly because one because it'll have a meaning remember the jewish people were declared a nation in 1946 on april and he says may the 6th of 1946 and the angel of the lord appeared to me on why he keeps saying april i don't know but said on may the 7th 1946 now the oldest flag is flying and things like that through israel all right now is that enough they've got it on the internet where they can uh well let's let's go on fix and say they had enough on there that we should have enough go to number nine let's pick that thought up it's from the lady of sin church age he said the lady you'll see in church age started in 1906. i predict now remember predict especially you listen at the tape i don't say it will be but predict that it will end by 77 that the church will go completely into apostasy and be ousted out of the mouth of god and the second coming or the rapture of the church might come anytime you say well and i've heard hours in the old days in the late 60s that a prediction was a thus saith the lord well now he says the lord didn't tell him we're going to read that in a minute he predicted things would happen there is no statement i invite you to bring it to me there is no statement of 77 that i can find that has any relation without saying a prediction you know or not the lord that i predict see people preaching this thus saith the lord no brother brown said it's a prediction we'll get back to that in a minute but this is the point i want you to look at now i could miss that a year and he just said 77. i could miss that a year i could miss it 20 years i could miss it a hundred years why because he's predicting now i'm serious as can be about it i believed he believed the lord was coming by 77. i do yes come we did you did all right but look now i could miss that a year could miss that 20 years i could miss it 100 years i don't know where but i just predict that according to a vision he showed me and taking the time the way that it's progressing i say it'll be something sometime between 33 and 77. at least this great nation is going to strike a war that's going to blow it to bits and things i believe he was looking for that i do i believe he was looking for it to be over with by 77 yeah because we were and i said the baptist said it'd be over with by 88. a great thing would happen a great thing did happen because in 46 when israel was established as a nation that day they were established as a nation the next day the prophet struck the gentile dispensation to bring the word right great thing did happen so it had a meaning to it i won't go on into some of what about this that i could cover but there's one thing about it we better click pay close attention because whether you like it or not we're running out of time an endeavor priest nowhere any date or any thought or any time that the lord was coming if you can find it bring it to me but i have read what your prophet said see he believed in those things something great did happen in 46 right right just as something great did happen in 1911. the 11th hour level something happened that was in writing it we could read it in our or you know we could turn over in the newspaper and see the war ended 11 11 11. see we didn't pay attention to it that god was giving us some dates and times then when it strikes 46 he's given us more dates and times he's given us a time that israel was established as a nation he's given us a time when the message struck the world so we can take dates and times and seasons you know if we'll let him say it not us now see because we put our own interpretation in there and you know what i'm saying you that was in the message back there you know what in the in the late of the 60s and the early 70s and all of these things you know what was taught i asked a man one time i said what if it pisces 77 he said i'll get out of the message and he turned his thought went back and that was all right cause his point he said no i'd say we misunderstood brother branham brother branham never said what he said about 77 everybody says that he says the lord's coming all this out and the other end of the world he said them things but all of them was a prediction and they see it leaves it then to where that we take what he says and then after a while maybe it'll unfold a closer point that he goes into the bible then and says things all right now if i can say them things i'm not making a prediction if i can say what he said is that making a prediction no that's making his prediction because that's what he said he said it was a prediction all right all of those things happen so he said i could miss it because he's predicting so when somebody comes along and says brought around and said the lord's coming in 77 you say no he didn't say that well i got this quote we'll read all the quotes now here he says he could miss it a year 20 years or 100 years that's right because it's a prediction now if he had thus saith the lord he would have told us right and you know what it would have been but he didn't he gave a prediction for the things all right let's go on just get read these predictions get it out of the way bird the one we just in the lady ocean i could miss it a year i could miss it 20 years i could miss it 100 years i don't know but i just predict that according to a vision he showed me at least this great nation is going to strike a war that's going to blow it to bits all right i believe he believed that and i keep saying it you know why i believe he believed that because we believed that now you tell me so brother dale i didn't believe it'd be 77 i'm going to say i don't agree with you because i believe you did now even though and i'll prove it in a minute even though i stood in 74 and preached that we could pass the year 2026 and not break the bible and our brother branham's message i still didn't think it's going to go that long i didn't want it to go that long and i didn't think it was going but i just read what the prophet said right because i took what he said if we can read what he said then we're a whole lot closer than all of our predictions but you know what i'm talking about you know how it was in the 70s you know how i told a dream anna was born what 74 where she three 73. i told a dream in about 70 or 71 that i dreamed that had a little girl just about this tall and that brother moat had a little boy about that size you know i told the dream you know what everybody life you're going to miss the rapture because it's coming 73 i said where you get that from because brother branham said 77 we're under it and we've got to have three and a half years tribulation before we get to 77. so i guess you're gonna miss it well you know why we're still here and you know what there's a little girl sitting over there it's got a little girl a little bit taller than what she was when i've seen it and brother mo little boys forest moat up in lebanon tennessee if you want to go see him the dream came to piss everybody was laughing at me saying well you ain't you're gonna miss it i said okay it's all right with me you know i didn't believe it but it's all right but you say well yeah in 1974 i just read what brother branham said and people didn't like it because they had all of the thus saith the lords whichever one of them was predictions because i want you to show me one time brother random even just made the statement of 77 without calling it a prediction or that the lord didn't tell him but see we take it we got it all figured out somebody come along make statements and roll it off and let you read it are we going to believe it okay go ahead number 10. this is called conference then i turned and looked and i seen the united states with a smaller in something that burned it up and down beneath there i said not in the trance but i predict remember this i guess this is tapes too i predict that these things will take place between now and 1977 which gives us 17 years left if my prediction strike a prediction a prediction all right go ahead at number 11. this is from this 70 weeks of daniel and in 1933 we were worshipping over there in the masonic temple where the church of christ stands today all right and i'll pull it on up he was over there striking it and what it was taking place and wrote it down told it because that was the dream or i mean the vision of the seven things that would take place all right that was 1933 and i predict that there would be some great tragedy happen to this united states before or by the year of 1977 how many remembers me saying that a prediction i'm reading these because i don't want you to come along i found another one go find it and bring it to me because this is all that i can find on the computer of 77. because watch this one go ahead and number 12. condemnation by representation really don't know he's talking about the vision right automobiles will continue to get like egg shape finally they'll build one that won't need a steering wheel they got it now it will be controlled by some other power when they first started out on the automobile they were trying to control it by one now they've got it so perfected until you just get in the car and you don't have to do nothing and they had to put the wire in the ground on the first ones they started coming across the country doing that right they start doing they don't have to put nothing now it's all guided by satellite you get in your car and go to california that's right it's here we're reading in the newspaper what's your prophet saying right now look then i've seen the united states there's one smolder and burned over it will be near the end then i got in for instance i predict that this will take place now remember the lord that's what the lord showed what did the lord show seven things that's what the lord showed but i predict this will take place before 1977. upon this prediction i base because of the own rushing slaughter that's coming now in the face of how things is moving where would he be today to look at it and see those things taking place okay so what did he say now the lord the lord showed him the vision but he predicted okay go ahead to the next ephesians parallels or ephesian churches he's talking about the ages and how they come down and uh the last lasted till 1750 the lutheran age then from 1750 the next day it's coming down 1906 ladies and church age and i don't know when it'll end but i predict it'll be done by 1977. i predict not the lord told me [Music] but i predict according to a vision they will show to the years and the things he predicted he believed it he believes it was going to be but he's enough to say the lord didn't tell me now watch this one go ahead to 14 which is the lady you see in church age all right as a servant of god who has had multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict i did not say prophesy but predict right because of the the things that he's seen and now even the lord spoke to him and showed all of those things right they were all to be there come on come on down go to 15. because this is the good one let us see in church age based on these seven visions along with the rapid of change and all i predict i do not prophesy that these visions will have all come to pass by 1977 and though many may feel that this is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that jesus said no man knoweth the day nor the hour i still maintain this prediction after 30 years because jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed now what's he saying he's saying you could know within a month a week or a year and you wouldn't be knowing today see jesus said no man knows the day so he's saying it you could know it like that all right he didn't seem to have any trouble i repeat sincerely and believe and maintain as a private uh student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium all right let's see if this one yeah go ahead to the next one see don't read just read 16. yeah okay number 16. don't miss a witches from daniel 7 which is from the 70th week of daniel don't misunderstand now and say brother branham said jesus will come in 1977. i never said no such a thing jesus may come today but i have predicted that between 33 and 77 something would take place that these things that i seen come to pass in a vision would take place and five of them has already took place now there's a point of interest to you why would he take 33 to 77 why would he use 1977 right why do you use it what was the purpose of using 77 something must have taken place in 1977. why would he emphasize 77 why did he end up 64 or 63 or the opening of the seals in 65 you know or something like that three four five did he use 77 he says he didn't know listen what about it what is the great meaning of 77. you know that in the the uh it's not the great planet earth i've got the book laying at home but it was written about the pyramids you know in the pyramids they have the wars to the dates in inches and things one two dates inches and things in the pyramid and the pyramid was built on a uh power squire you know form then it goes we do two one off but it's three point one four it's built up on that and there is in that chamber when you enter the king's chamber there is a wood i mean a a hewn-out bed in the rocks and they asked the man i've got the book at home so it's all don't matter they said what would be the last date you would find in the pyramid he said when it strikes a wall said it says in 1977. some of you studied those things some of you've read some of the pyramidologies and i'm not a pure mediology type of guy no but there were some odd things that was in there how they would how the wars and the things right to the my new inch which is in metrics instead of inches all right see what's 77 what's this one's it picked is it a random pick is uh 46 a random pick that israel becomes a nation on may the 6th and the word strikes the prophet in the cave and he takes a message to the world on may the 7th is that an accident or a pick of time is the 11th hour worker which represents the 11th hour people is that an accident that it's the 11th hour or is it bible fulfilled i'm just asking you a simple question i love questions you have an answer to the question i'd love to hear it but why would he pick 77 okay go ahead and number 17 which is off of the 70th week of daniel he comes along he's talking about the vision five out of three or you know five out of seven has happened and comes around and shows and then i predicted i never said the lord told me that but standing that morning in the church i said the way now listen to what he said i got back on one end of the wall and ran to the other end of the wall and i said by the way progress is going on i'll predict that the time i don't know why i'm saying it but i predict that that'll happen between right now 1933 and 1977 and not knowing it now he said he didn't know why he said it now he said in not knowing it he goes to the scriptures come on i never knowed it until yesterday that 1977 is the jubilee and exactly the same amount of time run out did he give with israel and everything at the end which is the same time we get and he says up here what i don't know why i'm saying it and he said i know and not knowing it god shows knows my heart he said 1977 was the jubilee okay i can stop right there without continuing any progress on anything and declare brother random was god's prophet and knew exactly what he's talking about see we're looking at 77 as a date we looked at 46 as a date we looked at uh uh 11th hour as a date we look at things as dates and times and the bible says i'm scared of your experiences that way you don't look at dates and times you look at what happens on the date when the day of pentecost was fully come you know what that meant they wasn't there in december or january or whatever i don't know what the date is there i'm when the day of pentecost was fully come when the holy ghost fell had to be the exact date the exact time right but what about trying to tell people this in 74 when everybody was already saying had to be overwhelmed by 77 they didn't even know what 77 was well it's just a year no your prophet said it's a jubilee a jubilee means a release that's when this message became more important to me than ever when it struck that 77 because dates and times and seasons was gone everybody had their predictions come on folks you out there on the internet you can smile and grin back off the corner but you know you faced it coming down through there and you taught all kind of dates and times and seasons for the rapture like i've told you many times one one man called me he said 1973 he said what do you think about this rapture of the church coming on good friday you know or the connection to the resurrection maybe he said resurrection i said okay praise the lord he said you don't sound like you believe it well i'm just saying praise the lord you know i i hope it happens he said well they do have it figured out then it can come one year later you know how nasty i am because you ought to know what i said back to it i said now it sounds like you don't believe it he was trying to explain 73 and in his own words he explained it could be a year later because like in the city you know you could have and you were locked in a city you had one year of time to get out they were coming with all that and you know what happened in the 70s people sold everything in the book borrowed every dime of money they could borrow it done every dirty trick in the book christians man told his church that this bar anything you want to borrow you don't have to pay it back anyway that ain't a christian christian pays your debts if you don't pay him you ain't a christian okay now listen not knowing god knows my heart i never noted until yesterday that 1977 is the jubilee why don't we think of 77 as a jubilee a release what are you trying to say brother dale 1977 has more importance to it than 46 and 48 or 11 for the the war being over or any of those things had more to do with it than all of that it was a vast turn of the biggest portion of people in this mansion they literally sent their books back they sent back they just dropped out of the message why because they said brother branham said rapture's coming 77 got to be over with a little girl they told me he said you're gonna miss it because if you got a little girl then you're going to be pissed 77 because she's born 73 well we're still here you know people went haywire when everything went wrong i'm going to say this part real quick they questioned brother branham whether it was right or not in 77. okay in 86 when it didn't happen they questioned the bible because they were going with the generation the year 2000 they questioned science and technologies because you know yourself we had a watch night service and people come and they said what should we do i said okay if you're scared make sure your gas tank's full where you can get home and i said bring you a fly slide because the power was supposed to go off when it struck 2 000. i'm serious i didn't bring flights and i've had one out in the vehicle that's serious i said bring you a flight slot make sure your gas tank's full or you can get back home because you think it's all going to be over do you understand what i'm saying they questioned the prophet 77 they questioned the bible when it got to 46 or either 48 and it didn't come to piss now mankind is questioning everything they have nothing like brother russ and i were talking about people have just gone to the bases now what there's no advancement there's no trying to move on there's nothing in the world while it's trying to do it it's just all folding inward like he was saying i never thought of like that america found out they could print money they printed money china found out they wasn't doing it they found out they can print money we print money all the countries started printing money why because they figured they ain't got to pay it you understand what i'm getting could we be questioning all the things that would be any hope for us over a date when i say and always have taught it in 74 still teach it today but around him know exactly what he's talking about to the very day he knew what he's talking about he said well nobody knows today and i i ain't talking about 24 hours a day i'm talking about a time element now let's see if we can prove that that he knew a time element well now you already understand what i'm saying what is the 77 it's a jubilee that's what he's saying he didn't say it was this or that or the other order he said it was a jubilee what's a jubilee it's a release the people had an opportunity in 1977 to be released but instead they run back and said brother branham missed it he's it they got bored in the ear they didn't have to go to the baptists in methodist get bored in the ear they went back to their own terminologies and got bored in the air where are they today it took 40 years but then they started blowing away like they're doing now the preachers preach 40 years now they're trying their best to prove brother branham was wrong i don't challenge nobody but i'll tell you that that's this is internet if you think i'm wrong on what i'm fixing to say come let's talk about it i'll meet you come let's talk about it because i'm going to just tell you what brother branham said about 77 and then you can do what you want to because this is what i've done in 74. and i never predicted no dates or times or seasons i just simply took calculations of what he said okay let's start okay number 18. now remember we're looking for a jubilee we're looking to find out what a jubilee is you're going to find out the bible's got a lot to say about it amen all right from the 70th week of daniel paragraph 195 he's coming down and showing that usher says the same amount of time you know it goes into galatians and the salvational part and he closes to the chronology of the hebrews the power of god was with the jews exactly 1954 years god dealt with the jews 1954 years according to the chronology of the jews and according to galatians 3 16 and 17 which you read that and you can't figure out how he's doing he's talking about salvation to the gentiles that's galatians read it god dealt with the jews 1954 years okay now counting the time we find that we have exactly listen 17 years left and we will have the same span of time given to us as god dealing with us and the power of the holy spirit since 1933 until 1977. 1833 until 1977. the same span of time 1954 years you're gonna say in a minute you crossed yourself no i didn't i just read what he said you're crossing what he's saying listen god deals at the same time he did with the jews now mark down in your book a little scripture here i want to give you leviticus 25 begin with the eighth verse god calls the jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was the jubilee we know that we understand that from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee now do you believe he's right making exactly 3 430 years jubilee means to going up the release making exactly 3 430 years give me a mathematical mathematical calculation of a 50 being a jubilee and bring it out to 3430. come on some of your mathematicians give them a mathematical calculation of using 50. well you know what you're going to wind up with you're going to wind up short because if you say 50 times 50 times 70 that's 3 500. you're missing it what does this all mean to me i just need salvation there is no salvation outside the word of god you are the one that's been arguing with the prophet not me you are the one that's been doubting the word of the prophet and i ain't smiling i'm saying you've been doubting because you've been trying to figure it out and you can't get it figured out and it never will be figured out by the human mind let's re-read leviticus 25 begin with the eighth verse i don't mind making this statement if brother random would have said leviticus 25 10 the rapture would have come in 77 or he would have been a false prophet he didn't go to 10 he went to 25 8. we're going to read 25 8 but we got to get this right okay beginning with the eighth verse god calls it jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was the jubilee okay we know that there's a 49. we're going to have to go through this in a minute there's a jubilee every seven years in the bible every seven years as a jubilee all right i'm giving you the words of the prophet and the bible all right see that's where we miss it at we think we've got it all figured out it won't work because look from the first jubilee from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8. in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making exactly 3 430 years the jubilee means to going up the release as i said you can't use a 50 because he's dealing with a 49. he just said as a jubilee ever calls the jubilee every 49th year amen brother random was not the messenger of lady osea you're going to argue that anyway so you might as well go ahead he was the messenger to stand between lady osea and eternity because the messenger always comes to the end of the age that's exactly right you know i've taught that for 40 years all right how did he get 34-30 how did he know the 77 was a jubilee we thought it was a year or a date he said it was a jubilee now mathematically do me something 49th year the 50th was the jubilee we know that but wade proved out here a while back that israel never did celebrate the 50. they have never celebrated the 50th why they don't know they know one thing he's supposed to let everything go free and they ain't going to do that they're jews okay now we think a jubilee is a 50. we'll do 49 times 50. no right so you go until you're 50. but watch him that's 2 450 years mathematically you're off 50 ton 49 you're off you got to have another number then all right so raise it up take your thing off and we'll we'll keep that to where we can use it okay come on up did you get that god has dealt it with us exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with israel from the time he gave give abraham the promise until the rejecting of the messiah in a.d 33 with 1954 years and then we have 17 years left we've had 1930-something years we've got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees read it now multiply 70 times 49. get it back up here and multiply form okay 70 times 49 equals 3 430 years brother branham know the exact years in the time 1977 is the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees from according to leviticus 25 8 making exactly 3 430 years but the random was right it was just us trying to figure it out see we tried to mathematically and you can't do it mathematically he done it mathematically because we don't know what to multiply we get in a jubilee and we want to use 50. but there was a jubilee every 49th a messenger come in that 49th now if i don't get time to bring it listen 49 represents the seven church ages that's right amen seven sevens is 49. you got seven church ages right each church age gets a release i hadn't left what it's telling you i'm just trying to stare away from where wade's at to where i can move over a little bit over here well that's an odd way of saying it but that's what i'm doing 49 is the seven church ages you need that from the prophet there was a jubilee in the bible every seven years no no no they just jubilee on the 50. see you're not in the line i ain't got time so i'm gonna push christ okay finish it this afternoon so what do we got according to leviticus 25 8 and the sabbath of the land shall be made unto you coming down from verse six and the cattle and the thing thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee all right and what will it be seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years there was never a change of the body in the church ages are we right no change of the body in the seven church ages you got to get outside the ages to have you change of the body you see you're dealing with 49. 49 times 70 is 3 430 exactly what he's saying well brother what i can't understand is called i know what brother branham said over there said it said in the 70s jubilee since it began it said what will it be said be going up for the gentile bride and the return of christ to the jews when they go out of bondage and we don't pass that a long ways so you missed it did it you're looking at the wrong thing i'm looking at where we started at and what he said that it's a jubilee a release a release a jubilee this message is what to bring us the ability to go free you agree with that there comes a seventh church aged messenger which was the holy ghost himself your prophet said it no messenger of the age because the holy ghost came himself said by the end of the age the messenger come brother brown steps over to end of the age starts his message and he comes forth proclaiming liberty when he come over to this he's seen what that was he was a jubilee do you realize what he's saying yeah but but he said it's a it's a return of christ to the jews when they go out of bondage this message is the release it's going to take us in the rapture will you agree the jews it doesn't mean a date so you're thinking that it said 1977 would have been the jews being released that's gone in the rapture that wasn't what he taught he taught 77 was a jubilee see we can go i know ain't got time to finish but listen if it's 3 430 years and he's got that right and if we believe it in 1977 it's the 70th jubilee then you realize you can add either one you want to but add 49 more years to 1954. excuse me 1977. can you add that up can you put that up take 1977 and had 49 more years because that'd be another jubilee i don't think you got me so just hold on where you're at that comes out to 1926. i mean 20 20 26. this is what i taught then and what i still teach today according to the prophet's message he never taught anything on dates and times we misunderstood him we didn't see what he was talking about it was a jubilee he was talking about not a year or time and we tried to figure it out we'd be here we'd be there i proved then by the prophet that we could go to the year 2026 by adding 49 years to 3430. if you want to add 50 you're going to go one more year either way you want to add it and this is what i say it i said we can pass the year 2026 and not break the prophet's message we still have the tapes of that where i taught him see i never taught anything about dates and times i read what he said 1977 be the 70s jubilee since the beginning of the jubilees from according to leviticus 25 8 making exactly 3 430 years something happened in 1977 we entered a jubilee i like to say we entered eternity that's a little hard for people to comprehend when you're getting older but if you'll take it that we entered the present tense form of the gospel you'll take it that we entered into present tense i am means ever present for eternity that's why i've been happy since then that's why i've told you everybody says revival's over it was a revival in 1977 when god showed me that and i came here and preached it and i said we'd go to the year 2026 and not break the bible or the prophet's message come and show me but you ain't gonna come and show me but you ain't gonna believe it because you're gonna think it's some kind of mathematic it can't be a mathematical i'll even give you one that'll flop you good brother branham says in 1933 to 1977 i mean 1954 33 33-54 i'm trying to get my memory back into place you're going to wind up with a 44 instead of a 54. if you add 40 years to 33 what do you got you can't mathematically count it brother branham missed it on a 10-year period but he didn't miss it come on folks he didn't miss it he was the prophet from time elements most of you don't even keep up with these things do you know that since 33 your calendar has been changed three times 33. it's been changed three times gregory and pope what's the other one alexander is that right julian julian it's been changed three times in the change of a calendar you can miss 10 years without a problem you say what are you saying he was right but you say mathematically he was wrong he wasn't that calendar has been changed three times one time they put 13 months in a year one time they only had 200 something days in a year because you know when you change your calendars you change by the stars and everything goes with it it very easily can eat up 10 years so he went wrong if you go across your mathematics and run it through what he's saying you'll find that there's a 10 years discrepancy but they're not because that calendar can be eat up that much in a hurry what are you trying to say let me run feist there's a jubilee in the bible ever seven years go to to deuteronomy and remember this branham uses the terminology but human man uses the terminology deuteronomy and the point of exodus is not talking about slavery so you got that all figured out of a slave a slave a slave how can a slave go in free at the end of six years he's a slave you better remember that abraham had a slave hagar israel had slaves of their own it's not talking about slavery it's talking about when a hebrew buys a hebrew my old brother call him money i go into bondage to him to pay my debt he can only keep me six years i don't care how much i owe him because that's the law and when he sends me out after six years i'll read you the bible i got it land right there he can't let me go home with nothing he has to provide for me to be able to live until i can get back on my feet i'm reading the bible do you want it read exodus read hebrews i mean uh deuteronomy see there's things in there you say what about that 49 in the church ages there ain't no change in the body in the ages you got to get out of the ages you got to be birthed out of the age to be into the point of the bride every bride was birthed out of the age luther wesley pentecost any of them were not in the age age-wise humanly yes it's out there we're in seven we're in the seventh church age yes the seven goes all the way to the millennium yes but we got to be burped out of the age if i went into debt with to brother colley he could only keep me six years in the seventh year he had to let me go and he had to provide me with things to go i'm reading the bible that's why i say have you read the bible if you ain't read the bible you don't know what i'm talking about if you ain't read it and understood it from that you don't know what i'm talking about but you know there's some more things the reason is covered in the church ages do you know that if i go into bondage to brother colley he can only keep me six years and prove that he's gonna let me go on the seven then it goes seven seven is 49 and there's a double you got a back to back time of releasing or you've got the prophet coming in the seventh church age to declare the holy ghost liberty of eternity to you and me and we can go into rapture but you realize i can read you right out of the bible if i go into bondage to brother collie and i take a wife at the end of six years she goes free but if i go into bondage to him and he gives me a wife at the end of the six years my wife don't go free that's bible some of you shaking your head so you'll know it's true that's bible all right see they've got to stay in bondage to him why because the church ages got a limitation to it there's no change in the body and the church ages 7-7 is 49 you don't get none you got to go to a 50. but you can have a jubilee a release every seven years which is the holy ghost inside of you releasing you but if i go into bondage he gives me a wife according to the bible the wife stays i can go to free but when you get to leviticus here's what i said while ago now listen what did i say a while ago that if brother branham would have said according to leviticus 25 10 25 10 says when you hear that gospel everything goes free everything goes free read your bible well i don't know what brother they'll tell them to read the bible and come show me if i'm wrong they say you're not going to read the bible so you're just going to go on your own way well i just don't believe it okay you're bound to the grave and i didn't say lost i said bound to the grave because only this message can set us free right come on musicians well just wait a minute it's 12 o'clock let's stand it's this thing i love him if anybody has a need the altar is open i hope you'll go home and think on these i cut a lot of it out 1977 was exactly what the prophet said just like 1946 was exactly what he said this exactly like 19 and 11 was what he said it was but have we accepted the release you got a question on it write it down i believe church that in 1977 you entered a situational i don't know how to say it a phase or a state or a point that there was a possibility of us being set free free enough to take a change but if we still stay with that then we're bored in the early that's why everybody thought it was slavery because it's not read your bible if a hebrew buys a hebrew and that hebrew came when that six years is done he can't send that guy home i'll read you the bible he says you can't send that guy home why because there is no poor in israel he can't send him home empty he's got to provide him something that's salvation and it also says what way to get into 20 days that they never experience those things because if you enter that seven and don't go on you got a problem at the people of the message what they've entered a time that i declare was the greatest release and the bible ever known of what that there could be a jubilee that would sound that we could go free of free enough to take a change of the body there's never been nobody taught nothing like that it's this message that covers those things the opening of the word uh love him i i love him because he first loved [Music] let's see [Music] anybody else 77 really meant something but it wasn't what everybody was looking at it was the time when this message struck the world and the greatest thing that could ever be was the opening of the word he said no i struck it back there come on it became a jubilee if we had accepted it but instead of that it became a condemnation to turn down this message now you want some quotes i mean some thoughts did brother branham say 77 would terminate the world system usher in the millennium et cetera you realize when the denominations turned this message down was 77 i can show you where brother random says the baptist that's in the 50s he said just become a denomination there was a denomination 200 years for them but no they hadn't turned down this message see what caused denominationalism to go wrong that's why it stated if brother brennan made the statement i love his statements and what he says he may not mean that to you but he said the seed shall not be air with the shuck seed now that's exactly backwards it looks like he said the shuck won't be iron with a seat no the seed won't be aired with a shove you know where the shuck went 77 they headed to the tribulation right see the the bride's not going to be heir with the shook because she's not going to the tribulation right see your prophet's right we just don't listen the bible's right we just don't listen father just we ask you to dismiss now your love be with us and wait this afternoon to minister your word we love you we thank you we pray that what we said has been worthy and sorry when it's not so you just help us we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you're just you
