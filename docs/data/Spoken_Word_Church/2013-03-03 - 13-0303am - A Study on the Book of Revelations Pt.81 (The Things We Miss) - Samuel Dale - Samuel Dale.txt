lives we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness help us to walk in you now as we read your word we know the prophet has told us your word is already anointed but we need to be anointed to hear it so Lord just open our eyes as we sing of our heart that we may see you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1-3 this is 81 times we've read it so everybody ought to know a little bit about it by now but uh kind of slow and just try to progress through the Book of Revelation says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to you unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy keep those things which are written to our end for what now the time is that hand what time the time to understand am cuz it's not another time you know this is the time to understand all right Revelations 15 and I saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven life's plagues where in them is full in them is filled up the wrath of God I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over His Image and over his Mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of GL having the hearts of God and they sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thy king of saints who shall not fear thee Oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been for as I said this is 81 sermons on on the study on the Book of Revelations and just kind of going through taking what we see and not covering everything but covering kind of up to where you know the day that we're living I've been reading a book that sister Trudy let me read on the it's Abbi e Ean every how you pronounced his name wrote a book back somewhere about 1965 about the children of Israel showing their beginnings and showing the travel the journeys their persecutions the the things all the way down uh up until that time and I really enjoyed that because it went right with what here you know I wanted to get over the end of the book but I still read the first parts of it to understand what the man was saying and uh you know to get that done and and then now get into where we're at right cuz I wanted to see what he was talking about Israel of today and all but it ended about 65 and that was when I think he quit writing but I really enjoyed it because it goes in here because we know that the Book of Revelations from Revel aans 4:1 is the rapture of the bride of Christ amen all right and then being that then we are seen only then in the fifth chapter right as to being taken up to heaven because that's a Heavenly scene you remember the question they asked the prophet and he answered it wrong he said that was not the bride and then uh someone he said there's something wrong you know Etc things went on and finally somebody told him to read his which was brother Ned Aon from s and told him to reread his scripture when he did he said he was wrong he said that was the Bride of Jesus Christ in heaven right all right and that way then we seen that the uh the parts that we understand that Israel the Millennium will be to Israel right and you know we're there on a honeymoon right uh you know to to be there and but that part that we we we're looking at is that from revelation they like 41 up we go up you start actually over in Revelations 5 the opening of the seals and the things glad to have our visitors with us that was a brother I guess that called me good to see you brother that's right God bless you yeah and uh this from Gana is that right Ghana Ghana Ghana I always get the places wrong so don't worry about it all right glad to have you with us welcome we always say when you come one time here you're a visitor two times you're part of us Amen Brother P and them and these others we talked about while ago they're part of us they've been here before we glad to have you with us so we we we're saying the prophet of God said the bride bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 right and it's not seen anymore until 19 he goes actually over to verse 21 on on his doings and uh see then we look at it and we see that the Bible is not what we think it is and it's not out of order right I've had a lot of people try to tell me that the Book of Revelations is not in order well I would like to to talk with you a little bit and see cuz your Prophet said that the end and buts was in order all right it's correct it's perfect if you understand what it's talking about am so then the Book of Revelations from Revelations uh 41 as the bride going up we see her in say in chapter 5 she's in heaven right all right and the scene in you see there is the uh the point of 24 Elders which is the 12 apostles and 12 Patriarchs you see the Beast you see all of the things in Revelations uh five to show you that Revelations 5 is the bride in glory and she's fixing to go from D because that's the marriage supper right amen and see you got 3 and 1/2 years of tribulation to the Jews after the Rapture of the church right all right and then we come back into Millennium on a honeymoon and all and and and from not from four there over to 19 is to Israel you see a lot of people will say you know what do you mean we're in Revelations 107 well if you go back and get Revelations 10 and bring it in correctly you'll see that brother randam says Revelations 101 is exactly the same as Revelations 11213 and there where that the the the one standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks right like unto the son of man G about the PS it's a feminist description right and Revelation 10 then does we don't have to go over there in the tribulation for that to be fulfilled we're here prior to the tribulation taking place but it's a compound meaning amen see there's compound meaning you remember to the Bible and even compound Revelation now compound meanings and compound Revelation as I try to explain is not that you see a trinity and I see one God right now that's not compound that's confusion all right that's not compound compound is when you take like the prophet said there was Israel coming up out of Egypt I brought my son out of Egypt but it was the main thing you remember when Jesus was born they took him to Egypt to get away from the killings and the things so when Jesus come forth he come out of Egypt right amen so then you got to come meaning that what the children of Israel and Jesus Christ compound meaning all right Revelation 10:7 right is the bride's message that we receive all right four through there the Thunders the opening we get the revelation of the book right we don't have to be there when everything takes place because we go up right and and these things take place so we get the revelation of it but then it's this message see watch the compound we get get the message we're getting it now before the tribulation right we understand the prophet's message we can understand the Book of Revelation we can see those things and thank God for it but we're not going to be over there but you know what it's this message righten yeah this message will go to Israel not a bunch of books but it'll be two prophets amen with the revelation of Jesus Christ and they will tell them about this message amen cu they must tell them about it they must tell them said you missed it but the bride has received it and they done gone into Glory you missed it back there when you crucified Christ you brought all these things on you to the Israelites been scattered to the world and persecuted ever since still are being persecuted amen all right but yet still see the compound meaning right the compound meaning to the scriptures then all right see then we can go through re rations 18:4 said come out of her my people yep that's right all right that tells us to come out of the organized religion amen but it's telling Israel to come away from the Covenant you know the 144,000 will come away from the Covenant that is made with the Antichrist so what's compound meaning it don't mean we have to be over there cuz the bride goes up for one she's in heaven in chapter 5 the seals are to Israel we get the revelation the I don't want to see the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God if we do we miss the Rapture right but around they ask him did that fulfill the first seal he said yes I certainly don't want to be around like we get this afternoon maybe Armageddon I don't want to be here when Armageddon takes place I certainly don't want to be here in the tribulation that's what we're going to try to get to in a second about it of what we miss what we miss yes by being the bride of Christ that's what I want to cover in a minute but I want to get these other things out of the way so then really in the Book of Revelations you go from chapter 5 you go over into chapter 6 you think about it chapter 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and even going into chapter 16 yep is to Israel yeah right all right right we get a compound meaning coming back we can read this and understand it and see what the Bible is speaking to us but the main thing will happen there the literal happening will take and you know that's only a 3 and 1/2 year period right yep what about all of those chapters all of those chapters that we read is only 3 and 1/2 years period of time all right but it's like to me like I've tried to tell you it's like the book of Daniel you read the book of Daniel and you read and he has one dream Vision or whatever you read and he has another one he has another one he has another one that's a continuation that's just like seeing the dream and stop it seeing the dream and stop have you ever done that have you ever been dreaming you wake up you think Lord God what am I dreaming that far you say I'm going to get up go get me some water I'm going to go to the bathroom I'm going to get rid of this thing and even pray and say and go lay back down and the dream starts right over where you left off you ever done that well see that's what I'm trying to explain about the Book of Daniel it's one thing that he's seeing right the Journey of Israel right so Revelation is seeing the Journey of Israel amen it's not a whole bunch of visions and dreams and it's the one thing showing their Journey right see didn't thank God that he sent us a prophet that we can understand the symbols amen righten y see as long as the symbols breaks you can read the book of Revelation read it now and you got in Simplicity right in in very Simplicity right you can see what it means the Beast we look at a beast you know something going across the Earth no it's wrong the red dragon is wrong the old mother horde they admit themselves will get to deceive their own book says that they are Revelations 16 17 you 16 about the harlots and the mother hord they admit it that's they're they're they're doing they're own writings all but you see it we get a revelation of these things right so the title of what I'm trying to get is look what we miss yeah look what we miss amen by being the bride of Christ amen amen right right you realize in the Book of Revelations it covers these thing and I'm not going to read each individual but you read them on through chapter uh 15 or where we were reading going into chapter 16 and read about the plagues that are going to strike the Earth or have been striking the Earth on the way back right the vows which is the plagues right see and you look at it look around the world today I was reading the other day where I forgot how many earthquakes it had in the paper the other day how many earthquakes were taking place in a 24-hour period yeah and the prophet of God said what he said after a series what one after the other after a series of earthquakes he said California will go under right look around the world at the things that are taking place today amen that our Bible being read amen we read in the Book of Revelation where there's a continuation you know he that is and was not and he that is and was not the prophet said a succession of popes way he said it amen well look at this when it just stepped down first time in over 600 years that this man has that somebody has stepped down for being po they always die but see now they're going to vote him in another one R around and sit watch that poke come out of the United States all right but what if this one don't come out of the United States what are you going to say right amen what if they get one out of Germany or somewhere this time what are you going to say it's not whether the pope is who he is that's going to put us in Rapture whether this message is revealed to us or not it's not what we we think of the world out there and what it's doing to put us in the Rapture it's whether the reveal word will bring it or not yeah I'm not looking to say cuz like you say what Brother D don't don't you believe the pope will come out of the United States yeah he said are the Roman Catholic Church would take over cuz you got a little other things to take and they're doing a pretty good job all right but you understand what I'm talking about now we read these things and see what will take place to Israel but by seeing what takes place to Israel we can look back at our own selves and see what's taking place now right right to you and I now you remember there the other day like last Sunday I believe it was where we were covering that Revelations 14 where it talks about those three Angels yeah and we gave her brother around said these three Angel he said that's after the seven angels see the seven angels would be the trumpet Angels would be the the seals the Angels the thing he said after these he said come these three and the angel number one chapter 14 there what was it he's the one with the Everlasting gospel right amen well see we looked at that coming down through time trying to figure out what it was and it says that that it's in heaven right right that it's in heaven right but then those on Earth is the one that hear it cuz you read Revelation 14 verse one the people on Earth is the one that receive it right cuz angel don't the the heavens when Satan was kicked out cure he's still up there already getting backward and fussing and everything else but he he he doesn't have the entrance he used to have cuz he was kicked out cuz when we go up the prophet said he then will be totally kicked out all right now quoting him but see those three Angels the Everlasting gospel y they always say forgive me for putting in the cough drop either that or quit cuz Satan has tried his best to stop me for years from being able to preach and I have to I've had to tone down a little bit to keep from being too hollering you know maybe that's pretty good maybe we don't need hollering we need a word but forgive me from having to to do that cuz I've done everything the doctors can't tell me what it is they say it's here they say it's here and they say I don't care where it's at get rid of it but they can't handle that part so all right but forgive me but see those three Angels what about an angel coming to Earth to have an everlasting gospel right now what kind of a what kind of a gospel would be an everlasting gospel right right see now here comes a prophet brother Randon what does this mean that's right of an everlasting gospel for our angel that you said it's not the seven angels right right and he tells us in the mark of the beast 54 there that it's the message of justification y That's right all right as I'm trying to get across Wednesday night what is the new birth and those three angels as I said isn't it coincidental and I mean that meaning not that the fact that it is it's it's this gospel amen but isn't it odd that Jesus preached and when he was crucified the prophet said the elements came out of his body water blood and Life to make the new birth that would come on the day of Pentecost all right now then it odd then that Luther would preach the josu live by faith all right and then Wesley would preach sanctification all right and then that the Pentecostals OFA Street 1906 would preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother R says there in the mark of the beast he said the Everlasting gospel is justification right we think it's some kind of a great angel with a great big thing but justification came forth by Martin Luther right to preach a message of the just shall live by faith amen see that message will tie together the entire Bible then righten if you understand what I mean it do we know and you know we've been through it studied it Abraham come through what justification sanctification the baptism the in t right amen he didn't receive those things but he come forth in t right right well see Jesus didn't come forth preaching John preached justification m right to believe on him that was to come Jesus preached sanctification went on into the baptism of the Holy Ghost but then the disciples come forth preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost and see on the original then they believe the new birth was not just believing right not sanctification but the original Pentecostal Doctrine was what justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen right see then we lost that down Through the Ages and we come out but it's odd that we came out with Luther preaching the justification Wesley preaching sanctification that's not odd that was God's way of doing it and see then the zeusa streets were preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost right we've been talking a lot on these things in the Bible study really had a good time last night we was about 45 minutes late last night on WE generally quited 8:00 but we got to tied up into adoption amen and I really app appreciate everybody in and you know in putting in their their part I really appreciate that I like to hear what you're saying but you know I I meant to say this last night you ever notice that brother R said he said now Billy Graham he said he has 30,000 converts he said he did said he go back in a year I have 30 he said but Paul had one he said go back in a year and said he'd have 30 from that one right but see he said well what's the difference you know but you know what brother Brown said about Paul he said Paul stayed with that man that's why he made tents for a living he didn't have to have somebody supporting him he made tents for a living see he stayed with that man right see we Billy Graham would get him to come to the altar but there was nobody to take them any further I used to question them when I was in the Baptist Church you know I wanted to go further in the gospel but there was nobody there to be able to help me and tell me the the way to go on but see Paul stayed with that man he' go live with him made tense and he'd wind up teaching that man the gospel he would take him through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Billy Graham might get him to repent that justification not thr off on him way doing he done a great wonderful thing all right if he got 30 out of 30,000 thank God for the 30 right yes sir come on we're not throwing off on nobody all right but those three Angels see of Revelations 14 justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost y see Paul would just stay with that person you know I mean it's kind of odd but see brother mol I when he introduced me to this message see it was kind of captivated audience because we had an hour and a half riding every day down and an hour and a half back well I didn't want to walk 60 mies you know but we was in a car food and see he would just start talking well he had his unique way he would just start talking well when he got to talking we may be home by then an hour and a half later and he's still talking about something well see that's what he done with me he kept carrying me through right right I've witnessed what Paul would do with his Converse carrying you through and keep on carrying you through brother dick and I brother adderson there we worked together for about over a month the first time and I came to the day Shi where he was at and I was the inspector he was a retiran and and things and and you see I could just talk with him every day well I did I just let him into a trap I didn't jump on to him and scream and holler about organized religions and things I just asked him you know what do you believe and and what's going on and and the main thing I'd seen some signs which I didn't understand but it would say a gothy Atlanta you know going down the road and I said what are these things what does that I knew what the word was but I wanted him to tell me yeah and he yeah he said oh said we're in on that said we do this and we do that I said well praise the Lord he's been in meetings where uh who is it the tamy Fay and then was in meetings and Baker and all of them they've been in all of those Pentecostal style meetings back there and you know witness some things but I just kept on and kept on and you know I let him explain to me what he believe well I believe in God in three persons you know cuz he's like I was he didn't know how to explain it I L him on through until I got him from God in three persons to three manifestations of the same God and we went day after day talking and I said one day I said do you really believe it's three manifestations and not three Gods he said I certainly do I see it now perfectly I said when I going to ask you a question see I didn't know that he had been studying about the water B baptism before then yeah and had it on his mind so I said well tell me about it what about to water baptism he said well I wondered about that too I said well let's talk about it a little so then I got into the water baptism into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well see then he come right on in today but my point is I was daily with him Paul was daily with this person that he was dealing with and see maybe he might have had three or four of these deal with he's making tense he's talking to him about the Lord Billy Graham could only get him to repent Hall could carry him on through into the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody don't just jump on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and get the first thing when you believe that's not exactly allog together scripture amen all right but yet when you do come to that see then you can see that you go on into the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I believe in a definite just justification absolutely amen I believe in a definite time of sanctification amen and a definite time of the baptism of the Holy Ghost am now if you tell me I got it all at once I'm not going to argue with you I'm not I'm going to argue with you if you say you went to the Altar and went through justification satification baptism of the Holy Ghost and come out with new birth I'm not going to argue with you cuz all things are possible with God right all right amen but I I have to admit I'm going to watch to see what you do right cuz you're going to prove whether you got it or not CU we're going to talk about the word a little bit and then you're going to wind up like some people have done that I've talked to with it you know and the word's going to drive you away but what is my point those three Angels is odd that they preach about how that the things of God and we give him glory and honor and and all of these different things in the hour verse uh 7 of chapter 14 and that's perfectly with justification right then the next one I'm quoting brother Brandon for these things the second Angel says Babylon is Fallen is Fallen well see that's sanctification right amen all right and then verse n says and the third Angel followed them saying with a loud voice and he's talking about the mark of the beast right yep well see that was the third Angel's message that struck the Earth Earth was a zeusa street and preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost sure they were trinit terorist but they begin to talk about the mark of the beast but then here comes the angel in the end times that was toet to correct where it would fall not an extra one but the angel of God which was brother random come and what was his message get rid of the mark of the bigs right right well see when we leave out of here now to show you the compound when we leave out of here what's going to Israel two witnesses what are they going to preach they ain't going to preach these doctrines to send the message that's right you know cuz you you can't take two Lords to Israel this won't work right now I'm not against all that that's their business you believe what you want to you can believe your big toeses God but just don't ask me to kiss it that's up to you but I'm just saying then you you come down to it and when it down I say this won't go to Israel yeah no well what you believe would it go to Israel that's right you take a God in three person Doctrine and go to Israel what you going to get run out of the country right right you take the doctrines of this message they said Jesus wasn't God until K the River Jordan right y when the Bible said he was born Lord the Christ am you think you take to Israel remember whatever we have is what's going to Israel the true gospel is what's going to Israel right am that comes from this message amen well see when we leave out of here those two witnesses are going to preach justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is 120,000 all right 144,000 excuse me cuz they've got to get them converted that's why it's going to take 3 and 1/2 years right they're going to preach 3 and 1/2 years to those people right that's right amen and get them converted I'm sure they'll get the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes but they will not be born Sons and Daughters of God because they rejected that right amen they won't be the bride she's done gone right amen amen but they'll receive this message amen yes sir cuz you asked they said Brother D would you sum up brother R's message you know you just asked me say could you sum it up you know what a lot of people would say my message you this other no no what would sum up the gospel justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen cuz if you can't put it under the ey where you going to go with it did not run around get into seventh seal and come over the end of it he's done set on the questions and answers he said it's gone from you there's no way for you to know it but said right around the coming of the the Lord will be made known that's in your conduct your questions and ANW when he gets on the seventh seal he said go on with the same simple message he said because if you don't you'll work yourself away from it what is the same simple message justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what them two prophets will take to do right it'll take them a long time to to hatch that out and bring it all right they're finally killed for what they believe amen right the two witnesses and all are finally killed amen but what about it I believe the new birth is justification sanctification the baptism and the ho we're not in Luther's day in Luther's day it was to believe God that was justification why because the rest of the word was not there far right see that's the one thing that we missed we were talking about last night my wife always made a good point out of it it was not the holy ghost that was eat down in the Ages come on you're Prophet preach the message in your church age book the holy ghost in every age every age has been the age of the Holy Ghost right see it was not the holy ghost that was eat down it was the word that was eaten down then the Holy Ghost can only work according to the amount of words you have so Luther preaching justification that was all that could be preached but that was the Everlasting gospel right Amen to strike the world Amen they said to Martin Luther said don't you know the whole world is against you he said I want them to know I'm against them right amen cuz he believed what he had sure then it started doing up and down we'll get to it this afternoon brother Brown said the first organized religion was the Catholic Church you know what he said the second one was Luther right third one ziggly or what his name is every which one of them all of them come down to the badst and time right they were the organized religion but the first organized religion you heard brother R say the Catholics say they were the original he said they're exactly right he said I'm an original Catholic right from the day of Pentecost amen right cuz the word Catholic means Universal see when you put Roman on it's when you right he's distinguishing where it's from all right but listen then see that Everlasting gospel and then coming even to that third angel that you and I can associate greatly with to preach about the mark of the beast and this Prophet is telling us about the mark of the beast what is the mark of the beast he said I gave you some quotes there of where he said that Mark of the Beast he he said if you're not he said you've either got one or the other let me make sure my quote's correct you've either got one or the other you've either got the mark of the beast or the Seal of God there's no gray area in between but brother Dell I'm repentant I'm doing this fine but you're not born again till you receive the new birth now if it's Wesley's day or Luther's day you might argue because back there it was that that justification was the baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen even John Wesley teaches in his own message you know of the the sanctification at the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother Brown give you a direct quote he says that Wesley said Methodist had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for their day because that's what it was it wasn't required for their day but then when ausa Street Struck it was required justification sanctification if the baptism of the Holy Ghost to make the new birth you see then that would put it back as the prophet said the last three messages of the last three ages completed to birth then it's got to come with the word and there's where you Prophet come into VI Amen to bring the message unto us to return us back into the word all right see then we can read the book of Revelation understanding the symbols and the thing and say Glory Hallelujah look at that so what was we talking about Wednesday night what is the new birth well brother Dale I got the new birth I believe you got quotes from Brother Brown he said when you believe sure cuz when you believe you started right y right right you know that that Peter and him believed and they started you know they were Sanctified in St John 17 right right I know Jesus hadn't died yet and that was a potential form sure but it was true but what if they said in the upper room let's take it by faith and walk out they would have never got the new birth and the day of Pentecost would have never taken place am right see isn't it odd then that the ages would tap out exactly isn't it odd that the Israel will Top out exactly that they'll get the message of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost giving them the new birth yeah for their age and their time amen all right that's not a coincidence to me that's a Wonderful Plan of Salvation cuz what is the Plan of Salvation it's not just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shal be saved that's the beginning right but has the Holy Ghost accepted you amen see at justification you accept him right you repent of your sins you accept him but if he don't accept you right right that's you don't have the new birth righten and the new birth then is the what the prophet said the birth of the word amen he said you can't be born again without a revelation that's right amen see you remember the man telling him he said I can't take something by Revelation you said well God can't deal with you either that's he can't deal with you it's got to be a revelation what ises that said about Paul he took them they repented of their sins but then they carried on and he kept teaching them teaching them teaching them until they come forth with the new bir amen then he could start talking about second Peter add to your faith virture and all his Temperance patience God and His brotherly kindness Exel but see the new birth is a birth of the word amen cuz the Bible said the disciples you Remember The Parables and some took the word and and the the cares of Life took it away and others you know the things just happened well one of them says there said they took the the word he kept it yeah you know that was the ones in the upper room right you said but if I could just see God if I do you mean I'm not saved let me quote the scripture the Bible says that Jesus was seen of over 500 Brethren now I'm quoting scripture right after his resurrection he was seen of over 500 Brethren right now where was the 380 when the day of Pentecost come right come on I just ask simple questions everybody said I'm so deep but I think I'm so simple till I'm stupid a simple question where is the under 380 where did they go they never kept the word no even though they'd seen the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ maybe ate with him maybe heard him preach for the 40 days or something he was therey but they never kept that word valuable but that 120 and they went to that upper room and they did the Holy Ghost came you know when that Holy Ghost came it didn't get to 380 now they might have been downstairs when they left cuz there was 3,000 guys the next time that's right that 380 might have learned by then and run downstairs I'm not leaving them out but I'm just saying they didn't make it on the first one that's right that new birth is the most valuable thing in the world Amen you realize then what I'm talking about you know that we miss these plagues and we miss these tribulation we miss these things that were that they'll be chunks of ice weighing 200 lb falling the Earth you see how in the world I can be I've seen them golf ball size Y A lot of people now seeing them almost baseball sizes and going on up right go now I'm not a scientist I just read so if they're wrong I read it okay what happens is water starts coming down and it freezes if that air current carries it back up scientifically speaking it drops back down yeah you know what it does it keeps gaining moisture so as long as it up and down current is going there that thing getting bigger and bigger you know what a 200 lb block of ice wouldn't be no great big thing we used to buy 100 lb block of ice 100 lb block of ice was only this size come on we used to B them you know we had the old chest freezer we didn't we would like y'all we couldn't afford to the electricity I'm about as bad as my brother said when they was in the cotton mill that time and the boss had caught him goofing off and him and his buddy was standing there and they they had to come up with an excuse while they goofing off and he said what are you doing up here said we look at that life said we want to see how long that thing will go before it goes out we had to fill them up you know all right we train TR the Wicks we done everything I'm a country boy I was pring a mu when I 7 years old so you don't talk to me about hard times but now listen those three Angels bring the message right and they have brought the message to us justification sanctification baptism and they take the message to Israel justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen right and see then we miss these things by having the new birth you remember the part the prophet laid out was so beautiful he said the bride don't go through the tribulation that's right amen he said now we may have persecution cuz look down Through the Ages how they was killed and what was done see for their belief but he said the bride does not go through the tribulation right now that's wonderful whether or not you you think it's very important or not well I don't care any important I just want to make sure I go up well how you going to go up if you don't know where the bus is at right now they might not understand my language like that but you see it's not just a he says he's got it but it's not just a bus pulling up that's going to take us up or an airplan we get on right see we're being born again amen that's what Peter said by The Incorruptible word of God Amen this message came to not only give us a new birth yes but to take us through to the change of the body am there's not another message to come to try to change your body the prophet said Rapture of Faith lays in what these books inent right amen where we going to find a Rapture not out in organized religion they don't even know anything about it n we listen the other night to a tape wife said isn't it marvelous what that man could say and he was talking about how Abraham and Sarah was turned back to a young man and a young woman she said look at there H he said nobody ever T that did he I said no but see I heard him that day say things that I hadn't really thought about as much he said Abraham and Sarah went on and we know that they were turned back to young man the Young woman you know and they had two kids so that proved something happened old grandma and granddaddy right yes 90 and 100 had two babies right but that ain't all the story Sarah passes off Abraham gets married again and got seven more kids that's right y surely something happened to him Butz that would have made what over into the 115 or 117 or whatever you count seven kids how old a man was I sat there and I said God that man was a prophet he know what the word said see we missed all of those things y but yeah we read the same book that's right but it was not meant for us to read it and get it it was meant for him to get it and bring it to us in the end time and it's to change these bodies yes nobody's ever had to deal with a change of the body that's right down Through the Ages nobody they just called they went and and confessed their sins and went forth and doing what they could do and a lot of them had to give their life for what they believe amen right that's right they wern't concerned about the change of the body that's why you wound up an organized religion and you noce there's still people believe in it today but in in this message that organized religion said we're going to get a new body yeah cuz you see they couldn't see the change of this body but in the message today there's still preachers that say we're going to get a new body I want to get this body made new amen amen I'm not going to get this I'm not going to get another the word new can refer to another I'm going to get this body redeemed the prophet said it ain't when you drop something you pick up something else no it's this body redeem Jesus raised with nail prints in his hand am he didn't get a new body right right but you see the preachers in this message teach you to get a new body yeah no and you know the one man that taught it boy he takes it all the way over and I listen to it cuz I want to know what he was just saying I never could figure it out but I want to know what he was just saying and I listen to a good many tapes and come to find out he said well we going to walk out on the AES and the Millennium on top of her own bodies oh my wrong well that's I don't see that one no right but then after a while he brought us through and brought us into the future home back into our bodies yeah well at least he got us back in them yeah no but I just don't see it that way no amen you know that's when I say it and I'm sorry I just preach what I believe amen see then if if we believe it look what we miss amen yeah we miss the fact it it's bad enough today until basically looking at a a 60 70 people and you know there's not a person in here doesn't have something wrong with you you agree with that even the little kids they have something wrong with them Nanny pulled one of kayle's teeth today that's part of the curse right she wanted Nanny to pull that too cuz she's pulled a lot of these little kids teeth around here and she just reached in there and snatching of course she got a couple of bucks too I here take a few out but see nobody is healthy anymore a baby used to be born and if it nursed its mother it would hardly ever get sick for the first 6 months why is it that you want the baby c yeah Zach is into that you take a baby calf and it's born you go around and buy you some good old fashion milk but they'll die they need that milk that comes from that Mama right and they say within what the first 24 hours or something if they don't get that milk deterioration starts if they don't get that first milk from that mother things start setting up they have two stomachs one of them is not even formed until it's 21 days old you try to feed it all you want to and you'll kill it yeah why because it go into that stomach and not not digest see church God is one wonder he put within the human body yes sir the ability for it to fight off these diseases the age is taking us down deteriation is taking us away but yet we're just one step from eternity one step into leaving out of this worldl thank you Jesus see why because we went through justification sanctification get the new birth yes sir and then we go through the adoption as we were talking about last night right amen and we come out to the headstone where the bride and the prophet of God said one of these days there'll be such a baptism when the Holy Ghost will come that it'll fill every fiber of our being I'm looking forward to that amen it may be he said a short time but he said it's coming amen he said he become visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go into Rapture now visible visible is not Corporal no no cuz his Corporal body don't step here till the millennial Reign we are his body amen he don't need to come here CU it'd be two bodies right he being his we being ours that won't work out until we get into Glory right then we can see him and us but here he don't need a body down here we are his body right the Bride of Jesus Christ aren you following me see then it's so wonderful to realize what we miss we miss these things to where the the animals will eat off the people's bodies while they're alive that's right we miss that amen we miss all these plagues right that's why I read these things in chapter 15 and going into 16 about the vows the plagues that are right read them that's right see what we miss we said I can't figure that out pain sensible without trying to have it a great Revelation think sensible look what it says in chapter 16:2 and the first went first V first plate and poured out his V upon the Earth and there fell a noisome great not noisy loudy right you know not loud noisome and you know and Grievous SAR upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshiped this image come on there's hardly anybody in the building it doesn't have some kind of imperfection as I say some kind of a an itch some kind of a a pimple sticking out some kind of a sore just CA sister Peggy got a black eye it wasn't D she won't tell us totally what that is but she's got a black spot on her huh get you to think I don't make jokes for jokes I make thoughts for to think of it right see sometimes you get serious and you die down on something you realize folks that there's things happening now the prophet back in the ' 50s talking about a child he was praying for that had what they call a Chalk's disease in the 50s if they went very long they just turn into chalk they just dry up and just crack and just finish y he said that they come such things upon the Earth that cancer would toothache that's a direct quote you want it cancer would be like a toothache compared to what's coming look at it today they don't know what to tell you that's right right well try is that's what it's practic in medicine try this try that did that work okay I'll write in the book yeah right that's right am years ago it was a bad thing came around here and it's pretty well like it now but the kids and all it just got back in the the 60s there you just coughing like everything yeah and you know the doctors finally say it said go get you some whiskey and some rock candy and some lemon juice you know some of them had different ideas but they give it to the kids said stop for cough give my kid no whiskey that cough drop I put in my mouth got more alcohol in it dried up then right people laugh and say you mean y'all take communion with wine go take your a sip of a of a cough syrup then read on the bottle and it says 28% alcohol you just drank more than one cup of wine would ever have any cu it's only like 12% at the most right but you see we think we're smart we don't believe in this out of dinner I don't believe in drinking either age no way but I believe in taking communion we will do that the Lord willing this afternoon right and it's like I said to you you say well an alcoholic don't need take a taste of liquor because if he takes another taste he turn back to an alcoholic that's true if he ain't born again yes sir that's probably true if he ain't born again but if he's born again ain't going to bother him am why cuz God's going to take care of it that's right I'm not going to give him grape juice and just do without taking it grape juice will rotten they talk of the blood of Christ we Baptist used to order a bread and we used to take communion every 3 months so we'd order a bag from the publishing house and we keep the bag of of little crumbs of bread I mean we had a little bit wafer looking thing yeah what you call them little square things and we keep them for a whole year put them up in the freezer and just freeze them back and keep them for the next 3 months when the Bible say it's burn the bread the next day before the next day comes burn the bread see we thought we're smart but anyhow listen we miss these plagues y by having the new birth amen God is not going to come upon them with a new birth y now let me explain that cuz that goes into carnality in man's mind right just because when you're a Christian don't mean that you're not subject to diseases and things right we're still human we can still get sick the prophet of God was sick Jehovah Gyra series we just listened to him and in gr Valley California and there he was praying for the sick to be healed the dead raised and all kind of things happen you know what he's doing he's going to the doctor every day he says it is s see we're not against doctors we just don't put doctors as the healers we thank God for doctors brother Rand would tell a man he told one one time he said he come up told him said I got a problem my stomach he said yes it there's a doctor down here do those operations go let him operate on that's right a prophet look what he said thus say the Lord is gone like the brother here W back was saying he's praying for a lady one day and he said you're just going through the change of life he said if I asked all the women out here to raise your hand he said probably 90% of them be going through the change of life well he went ahead and pray for the lady but he was simply explaining that we're under the curse we don't believe in immortality In the Flesh until the change of the body amen now that was AI Doctrine right some of you don't know about them but he let his heart grow out call it out different said he wasn't getting older that didn't make no difference he died but he taught immortality in the F flesh they said that now this is a quote from somebody else okay they said they asked brother Brown about it and said brother rown said he gets my tapes see brother Brown never taught immortality In the Flesh uh you know the fact we ain't going to get older but he did teach that there's going to be a change and we're going to have an eternal body cuz that'll be the completion of our new birth see when we walk out of here in the Rapture and going up through the iron you can look over Brother Gary and you say Brother Gary I'm born again cuz the new birth is a birth is a coming forth into we're going to come forth into a glorified state to walk with Jesus and be as he was but we miss all of these things we miss all of these plagues and these vows and these horrible things that are coming upon the Earth yeah but see look at it we're still here we're we're still subject to these things yeah right but we're not tied by them amen and I'm going to tell you what I believe whether you believe this or not but I believe if you're a born again Christian two bornn again Christians a man and his wife and they're truly Christians born again that Born Again experience ends the chain of the bringing down diseases right that you say mama was this and Daddy was this and Grandpa was this and grandpa had high blood pressure you you see you're missing the point I I thought we believed in an atonement see you say I got high blood pressure CA Grandma had it mama had it Daddy had you're inviting those things to stay with you but we believe in healing don't we well why can't we believe that we'll get born again that that can stop that visited iniquity right if you come along and say well I've got high blood pressure you invited it to come especially when you say it come from Grandma Grandpa why not say the blood of Jesus Christ atones for all things and can end that line of visited iniquity because even under visited iniquity remember that after 400 years it was gone am I in the Bible yes right 10 Generations 40 years to the generation after that 400 years you could come back into the congregation your your genealogies could why because it bled its way out why can't we believe in the blood of Jesus Christ stoping it thank but see that's what we do we go down to the doctor and the doctor says your blood pressure is going up did your daddy had it yep yep he died with it he had two strokes I'm talking to my daddy had two strokes that killed him high blood pressure probably cuz he didn't know sure I take blood pressure medicine thank God for it but I'm not dependent upon that I'm dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ heard take the other night me and my wife and I said honey I've said that all long we were sitting there listening you know we're getting old enough we just sit down at night and listen to tapes we're not out with galivan and we sitting our list and and brother brand was talking about these things things and talking about simple things of healings and signs and wonders and why can't we believe it why can't we believe that he could take care of all things right amen that he can cover all of our problems that's right through the blood of Jesus Christ amen he said this way he said you you're sick now it's in Jehovah Gyra it's got to be real one two or three I think it's real two Jehovah Gyra 62 I'm pretty sure he said go to the doctor and let the doctor tell you that you're heal right now love always said that to you you taking blood pressure medicine don't stop taking it let go to the doctor and the doctor said hey you know your blood pressure is so low do you need to get off of some of that medicine right he said go to the doctor and let him tell you right see you're not putting a confidence in the doctor you're doing what he's saying let the doctor tell you you don't need that anymore with brother call his wife sister Ruth years ago they took out her Peary gland which suppli all of the hormones of situations or whatever you know in the body they took it out it automatically makes you a diabetic they gave her insulin she said what should we do brother Dale I said let's pray I do that I me come on I do that in my in what we call the medicine cabinet to the house there's a pray cloth stuck up there I tell you when you get medicine from the doctor sanctify what's the matter you sanctify your food why don't you sanctify the medicine that you take she said what do we do I said let's pray over and sanctify few months later she kind of having problems she went to the doctor and the doctor says you got too much insulin they didn't have nothing to produce it that's right you know what they done they took her off of it praise the Lord you know what she never did take no more inst amen right and there was no gland to produce the insulin oh that was just an accident she had two glands well go ahead and do what you want to with it I say God healed her and if she did have two GL God healed her before she started but he gave her two gland right so don't play with me with words right right listen Church we miss these things by being Christians by being the bride of Christ we miss all of these horrible things that are coming upon the Earth after saying what I did it we're all sick but yet wonderful that we know who the healer is that's right and thank God for the doctors CU brother Brown you want to quote he said God heals with medicine he said God heals with music he said God heals with laughter amen you want those Quotes come on folks if you thinking is wrong then why did Brother R say The Beatles and they're singing people were healed now did he say that to the be even said it look like we're going to have to go on a healing campaign now you know what garbage cans they were was because people got in an atmosphere that's raised up in to a place and they could believe and everybody else was shouting to The Beatles and somebody sitting in the wheelchair they go walking what they done they got out of their self ourselves our worst enemy we killing our own self like I tell you we come in here we pray for the sick and it'll happen today we outside what the doctor say about you you went to a day didn't you we go outside and we talk about what the doctor says well let me tell you what the doctor Jesus said he said by Stripes I'm Healed thank God for the doctor thank God for the new birth that puts me in a place I don't have to go through these things that I can believe yes sir hallelujah praise God the Bible said all things are possible but we don't read that correctly right we say it's possible with Jesus but the Bible said all things are possible to them that believe that's scripture what's wrong with us why do we keep our sicknesses cuz we're going out talking about the doctor right I told you about it I walked in one day and this doctor he looked at my kneecaps and D this 35 40 years ago and he done x-rays on him he done chest he's a specialist he said I'll just take I take that kneecap off right

that but you see I go in there now he said how you doing I said I'm doing wonderful I told one doctor one day I said if everybody was old as I am felt as good as I do I said you'd be out of business he said don't you tell him about it I said I won't I have some good time talking to doctors you know what I legal hey if you want to click on know what we believe click on the spoken word church.com amen and you'll find out what we believe that's right cuz they all go in they say you're a preacher yeah I'm a preacher I don't like to go by that you know why because a lot of people think you're supposed to give you something I always tell I said doc I ain't here for you to give me something I'm here for you to help me I'm hurting help me get rid of that but God is the Healer am that old

right ahead and operate why because God is the Healer see that's the benefits of having a new birth we don't have to be bound to man's ideas and opinions and thoughts we've got someone to take our problems to amen let's stand together that's right not meaning to just follow screen you today get you to see I believe Jesus Christ the yesterday today and forever yes sir I believe he's the Healer the Savior the deliverer he's all in all right and just I'm just an oldfashioned if you want to call me a metho baptized Presbyterian Pentecost that's what I told an Undertaker one day he said what in the world are y'all I was doing a funeral with brother Maloney up in in Knoxville Tennessee he said what are this what are y'all I said I'm a metho baptized press here in Pentecostal he said I'd hate to write that on a deser I said I said I don't intend for you to ride it either but you see church I believe Luther had the word sure he went into fanaticisms and everything but he had the word of faith that's the Everlasting gospel that's still go in the world over if you get born again today you're going to come by Luther's justification no bless God I'm not much on the organ rels like we were talking about last night see people don't quote brother Brown and keep it you know that we were talking last night about how that the law was a school Master to bring us to Christ the faith is that scripture Paul in galatian you know what brother Brown said he said the denominations were School Masters that's right abely you argue with him about it he said but they brought us to Christ which is the word that's right I thank God for them old Baptist preachers that tried to help me yes sir I've heard him preach some wonderful sermons and the man I told you the man that put me in the
