[38:54] our eyes
[38:56] this is the day which the Lord hath made
[38:58] we will rejoice and be glad in it
[39:01] save now I beseech thee O Lord O Lord I
[39:04] beseech thee sin now prosperity
[39:08] Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of
[39:11] the Lord we have blessed you
[39:14] out of the house of the Lord now let's
[39:17] go to Hebrews
[39:19] 13.
[39:22] we'll begin reading verse 10 through 14.
[39:30] we have an altar of they have no right
[39:33] to each which serves the Tabernacle for
[39:36] the bodies of those beasts whose blood
[39:38] is brought into the sanctuary by the
[39:41] high priest for sin are burned without
[39:43] the camp
[39:44] wherefore Jesus all showed that he might
[39:47] sanctify the people with his own blood
[39:49] suffered without the gate let us go
[39:52] therefore unto him without the count
[39:54] burying his reproach for here we have no
[39:58] continuing City but we seek one to come
[40:01] you may be seated the Lord had his
[40:02] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[40:06] know to those that would be on uh it
[40:09] will be live internet I guess to the
[40:11] video but through you will when you get
[40:13] an opportunity you'll be able to see and
[40:16] a lot of people and see what I look like
[40:18] and behold the only day that I have done
[40:21] it I forgot to bring my coat
[40:25] so we are here as normal and looking
[40:30] normal I did find a tie a word that I
[40:35] could be able to you know look more like
[40:38] the the day and the time we're not
[40:40] people who celebrate
[40:42] so much on a lot of things but we do
[40:45] thank God for the freedom that we have
[40:47] right we thank God for the independence
[40:50] you know Independence really means the
[40:53] the state or fact of being free from a
[40:57] binding situations or subjection to
[41:01] situations that make you worried that
[41:03] you're not free and here in America it's
[41:06] a wonderful time because see when we
[41:08] started our our independence day
[41:12] then that was a time to worry that we
[41:16] were getting away from religion
[41:19] you know the religion of mankind and we
[41:23] thank God for the fact that we have had
[41:26] all of these years and the time that we
[41:28] could be to where we could could
[41:30] appreciate uh the Natural Freedom to do
[41:35] that it's cost a lot of lives of men and
[41:37] women around the world to pay that price
[41:41] that we could have freedom because
[41:43] Freedom never comes without them without
[41:46] a price it always is something that is
[41:49] related that's going to be a price in
[41:51] other words if you have freedom you're
[41:53] going to have to to in some way or the
[41:55] other pay for it because it's one of the
[41:57] things that man is not going to let us
[41:59] do we came here as the saying goes uh
[42:04] you know to get away from religion we
[42:07] didn't come here to to set up another
[42:10] religion or or do whatever we came here
[42:13] to get away from the the ways of the
[42:17] catholicisms and the things that was
[42:19] bind ending people to their ideas and
[42:22] thoughts and we came here for our
[42:24] freedom and we we certainly thank God
[42:27] for that amen
[42:29] and you know we started out here I told
[42:31] you we this is the beginning of our 40th
[42:34] year uh it fell to were the Fourth of
[42:37] July fell on uh the Sunday because we
[42:40] started here some of you may not know
[42:42] but we started here July the 4th uh
[42:46] 1971. we had a service the Sunday before
[42:50] down in our home there in Gillsville and
[42:54] but we officially started a the service
[42:57] here and the little old building and it
[43:00] was just right across where you see the
[43:01] beam and said all it was in a little
[43:03] small Nook right there you know that
[43:06] um was the old building but you know we
[43:09] we rented for many years and and
[43:12] everything and then was able then to
[43:15] purchase the building
[43:16] but we hope that it does not repeat
[43:18] today like it did before because the
[43:21] first service we had here July the 4th
[43:23] 1971 there was
[43:26] um four cars and a Truck a pickup truck
[43:29] parked up in front because we couldn't
[43:31] go back into the back it was all this or
[43:33] no hedgy stuff and you know but a man
[43:37] came down the highway up here and he was
[43:39] on prescription drugs driving a big old
[43:42] Cadillac and a man was trying to stop
[43:44] him that told us about it and that he
[43:46] was running about 80 or 85 mile an hour
[43:48] coming through here and uh
[43:52] so in a chain reaction he hit the
[43:54] vehicles and he would hit one knock it
[43:57] into another one hit that one knock it
[43:58] into another one and he hit all five he
[44:01] got every one of them and sitting here
[44:03] the wrecker had to come and pull away
[44:05] brother mulk's car and my car and mine
[44:09] was about into the middle of the chain
[44:12] and and when it got through it looked
[44:14] like an accordion because it was a Wham
[44:16] on both ends you know but we had to to
[44:19] do that in in that afternoon we all
[44:21] brought second cars some of them were
[44:24] not damaged too bad but uh brother moat
[44:27] we were singing
[44:29] conviction to dismiss
[44:31] and he said let's sing one more song
[44:34] well if it happened we would have been
[44:36] outside
[44:37] you know walking around in the front so
[44:40] God is with us
[44:42] you know we kind of laugh about it
[44:45] because people after then they kind of
[44:48] heard about what had happened and a lot
[44:50] of people were afraid so when they would
[44:51] come to services they would go up the
[44:54] street and maybe park somewhere else you
[44:56] know
[44:57] but the city of Lula then came and asked
[45:00] us could they clear off the the back
[45:02] back here for us to help us out you know
[45:04] where we could get some parking but now
[45:07] I preached that Sunday
[45:09] afternoon
[45:11] on the same form that I will today
[45:14] because I titled the message then going
[45:18] Beyond man's camp
[45:21] will preach that morning service and
[45:23] then I preached the afternoon service
[45:27] and uh calling it going Beyond man's
[45:30] camp and I read this scripture I think
[45:33] because Jesus was crucified we've been
[45:35] there we've seen it that's why they're
[45:37] arguing over the place of the actual
[45:40] crucifixion but if you'll take the
[45:43] scriptures and read it that Jesus was
[45:45] crucified without the camp in other
[45:48] words outside the city so that's where
[45:51] Golgotha comes in and then that's where
[45:54] they say that he was crucified but there
[45:56] is arguments over that that it was
[45:58] inside the city but I don't believe it
[45:59] because I believe the scripture because
[46:01] he was crucified outside of the gate now
[46:04] here's my point I made then and I still
[46:07] want to make it to you and I
[46:09] that wherever God is that's where we
[46:13] want to be right right amen right
[46:15] amen if he's without the gate then there
[46:18] shouldn't be any problem with us of
[46:19] realizing that's where we need to be
[46:21] right in other words if you went over
[46:22] there today to try to find him where
[46:24] would you find him
[46:25] if you went there to try to find him in
[46:28] Israel where would you find you'd find
[46:29] him outside the gate why because he was
[46:32] put out right
[46:33] he was taken outside the gate
[46:36] and crucified outside of the gate you
[46:39] know outside of the city walls and
[46:41] things and see that would be a a thing
[46:45] then let us go out unto him the
[46:47] scripture says right
[46:49] so now ever where he's at that's where I
[46:51] want to be and I preached that day a
[46:54] simple form of saying to anyone that
[46:57] would ever hear the message
[46:58] it was about 25 of us here
[47:02] and I preached it like this I said now
[47:05] we have went to church in a lot of
[47:08] places and we've tried to to you know do
[47:11] the best we could and really this church
[47:14] was started on the basis of not being a
[47:17] church it was just a building rented to
[47:20] where that we could call in somebody and
[47:22] how Services that's was our full
[47:24] intentions in the beginning but it
[47:27] developed into a church but I preached
[47:29] the message that day of saying now
[47:31] brothers and sisters we're trying to go
[47:33] beyond a man's Camp because that was
[47:36] 1971 they had already developed among
[47:40] the message many many counts groups
[47:44] groups of people you know that had
[47:47] settled down on the two Souls uh seventh
[47:50] under virtue of the perusia the no Holy
[47:53] Ghost doctrines all kind of things that
[47:55] had begun to develop you know and I said
[47:59] then I said you forgive us but we're
[48:01] going to try to go beyond man's camp
[48:05] because the prophet of God said said we
[48:07] can't you know
[48:09] there's a one message that I wish you
[48:11] would would listen to or or get it and
[48:14] read it is going beyond the count priest
[48:17] in 1964. uh 7 18 the evening service 7
[48:21] 19. that brother Brown talks about going
[48:24] Beyond man's camp
[48:27] and he said we we go beyond our camp of
[48:30] our own thinking
[48:33] let's go to the thinking of God
[48:36] so it's not our thinking because most of
[48:39] the time we're on
[48:41] so to be sure let his mind rest in us
[48:45] and his mind was to do the father's will
[48:48] let us go beyond the camp tonight Lord
[48:52] and find Jesus because see you're you're
[48:55] not going to find him in organized
[48:57] religion restaurant damn now I'm sorry
[49:01] you know I've done that then and I'm
[49:03] saying it now you're not going to find
[49:05] it an organized religion now I will
[49:07] preach a message later on this because
[49:10] he can appear there yes he can appear
[49:14] today and save people I believe that I
[49:18] believe that he can appear in a
[49:19] denominational church today and say
[49:21] people I say it's getting pretty thin
[49:23] about doing it maybe but still I still
[49:26] believe it because we never want to
[49:28] limit God the but when he appears there
[49:31] that's one thing but that's not his
[49:33] coming that's right that's a different
[49:36] thing and we'll get to that when we we
[49:39] do but let's go beyond man's camp and he
[49:41] says you'll never find him by joining
[49:44] the church you'll never find him by
[49:46] shaking hands with some minister or
[49:48] signing some Creed
[49:51] or something that we promise to do not
[49:53] go to church uh Sunday school and all
[49:56] you'll find him we'll find him in the
[49:59] word
[50:00] because he is the word amen
[50:03] and as we see this day promised
[50:07] that he's to be outside to Camp put out
[50:10] again
[50:11] now let us go beyond the camp ready to
[50:15] bear his reproach hated to the world but
[50:17] love to the one who invited us to the
[50:19] camp all right so
[50:21] we're going Beyond man's Camp that's
[50:23] what we were wanting to do then
[50:25] Beyond man's ideas trying to move on the
[50:30] now God has a camp
[50:34] God has a camp you'll hear Brothers in
[50:37] the same message he's talking about
[50:39] right
[50:42] he said uh
[50:46] let me see so you see they go beyond the
[50:49] camp of God's word to find their answer
[50:53] now God has a camp
[50:54] right because it's his word right right
[50:56] so that's where we want to go beyond
[50:59] man's Camp our own thoughts
[51:01] and I told him then I said brothers and
[51:04] sisters you forgive us because we're
[51:06] wanting to move on in the Lord what I
[51:09] believe God has used that and we've been
[51:12] able to go on but people are persuaded
[51:14] to their dogmas and creeds
[51:17] without the camp right amen without
[51:21] God's Camp you can't stay in God's Camp
[51:24] because God's Camp is going to be where
[51:25] the word's at the children of Israel
[51:27] were down in Goshen right the light was
[51:30] in negotiate that was where God was at
[51:33] was with the people but we want to go
[51:35] beyond our own thinking not somebody
[51:37] else who's that see it's not
[51:40] um anybody else bothering you and I it's
[51:42] our own thinking it's between our ears
[51:45] called our brain you know there's where
[51:48] we hear there's where we make up our
[51:50] minds and things and we we turn around
[51:53] in and we can denominate you remember
[51:55] what Moses done
[51:58] Moses smoked the rock twice you'll find
[52:01] it in that message he smoked a rock
[52:04] twice but he was only supposed to speak
[52:05] to it right that's right and brother Ron
[52:07] said when he did he set up an
[52:09] organization or a denominational system
[52:11] because he went beyond what God had told
[52:13] him to do amen and that's how simple and
[52:16] how easy it is is for us to just add to
[52:19] the word of God or take away from the
[52:22] word of God will automatically make our
[52:25] own camp and it doesn't matter how long
[52:27] or what we keep saying that they're all
[52:29] we're independent we're independent
[52:32] you know
[52:34] we're still the same as everybody else
[52:37] I've showed you here a while back
[52:39] you're born to an organization
[52:42] that's why we got to be born from
[52:45] you all right but see we've got to to
[52:47] come out
[52:49] all right so now let's read uh one more
[52:51] scripture and then we'll get into our
[52:53] thought looking and uh
[52:56] Corinthians
[53:00] second Corinthians
[53:02] excuse me
[53:07] second Corinthians
[53:16] I'm going to start with about verse 16.
[53:18] because I want to read this because
[53:20] Brother Ray and I were talking just a
[53:22] moment ago about it you know uh people
[53:24] are talking about now that all of this
[53:27] things that are happening the oil that's
[53:29] in the ocean is the tribulations and the
[53:32] things now it's a pre-tribulation it's
[53:34] not de-tribulation uh it is not the the
[53:38] wrath of God poured out it is the wrath
[53:40] of man poured out see so then we were
[53:44] talking about that and I wanted to read
[53:45] this because over in Revelations when it
[53:48] is 18 4 where it says come out of her my
[53:51] people all right
[53:52] brought around uses that scripture for
[53:54] you and I right but really that
[53:56] scripture is to Israel and the reality
[53:59] of where it's placed and what it's
[54:00] talking about and what it's doing it's
[54:03] really over there but you're in the
[54:04] scripture Paul picks it up in
[54:06] Corinthians so let's get this and then
[54:08] we'll get on to our thoughts
[54:10] from second Corinthians 6 about 16.
[54:13] in what agreement hath the temple of God
[54:16] with owls for a year the Temple of the
[54:18] Living God
[54:19] as God has said I will dwell in them and
[54:22] walk in them and I will be their God and
[54:24] they shall be my people now watch
[54:28] now if we are that what is going to take
[54:31] place amen wherefore therefore
[54:34] see
[54:35] all right
[54:36] wherefore come out from among them and
[54:40] be your separate saith the Lord and
[54:42] touch not the unclean thing and I will
[54:45] receive you and will be a father unto
[54:47] you and you shall be my sons and
[54:50] daughters saith the Lord Almighty all
[54:53] right so it's always been a coming out
[54:55] right amen it's always been a coming out
[55:00] we'll get to it in a minute that's
[55:01] coming out and then going into but it's
[55:03] always been a coming out amen all right
[55:07] the main thing it is we're doing is
[55:09] trying to come out from our own thoughts
[55:12] and ideas
[55:14] all right I'd look back and see look
[55:16] like we've got a visitor
[55:18] so we say to you welcome all right we
[55:21] didn't see you a moment ago or we'd
[55:23] already greeted you but we always say
[55:24] when you come here one time we say
[55:26] welcome
[55:27] you know we don't say welcome because
[55:29] you're part of us we don't have anything
[55:31] we didn't come out of the organizational
[55:33] systems to be able to set up a church
[55:36] that we could all join because that
[55:39] would be the same that they were doing
[55:40] and we haven't tried to come out of of
[55:43] anything other than our own ideas what
[55:46] somebody else says you know what
[55:48] somebody else teaches that's fine but if
[55:52] it is according to the words and we say
[55:54] to you welcome and and make shift at
[55:56] home with us all right but now listen
[56:01] the prophet of God ought to scan through
[56:03] sometimes because you know what he's
[56:04] talking about on to come out of her my
[56:07] people see he said the church has failed
[56:11] now listen to this one real careful
[56:13] because I like to read all of them so
[56:14] you like to get these down here that
[56:15] sounds and I like to read all the things
[56:17] he said instead of bringing the people
[56:19] together as one body
[56:21] in other words the church done it
[56:23] separated them because the word
[56:25] denomination what does it mean
[56:28] conquer and divide a common in in in a
[56:33] common denominator in in math see you
[56:36] you've got to get those things to divide
[56:38] with it all right he said just like
[56:40] Moses instead of speaking to the Rock he
[56:42] smoked the rock you see and it failed so
[56:45] the church will never take the people
[56:47] over Jordan
[56:49] right so that's right but now God has
[56:52] changed his order and he's sending back
[56:56] you who mark my word
[56:59] there's Great Men on the road to this
[57:02] world now listen to it
[57:05] that's right there's great powers on the
[57:08] road to this world
[57:10] and it'll be a people that'll call out
[57:12] of people but
[57:15] we want to make it all into brother
[57:17] random that's fine because he called us
[57:19] out but now we're calling out see he
[57:21] brought the point of calling us out now
[57:23] we've got to go on and it'll be a people
[57:25] that'll call out of people Remember come
[57:27] out of her my people is that right
[57:29] Babylon confusion
[57:31] and not the people now not out of your
[57:34] churches
[57:36] me
[57:37] I'm not trying to call nobody out of
[57:39] church either right
[57:42] I'm not trying to get somebody to come
[57:44] to this church
[57:45] that's your choice
[57:48] but here's what I'm trying to get all of
[57:50] us to do
[57:52] but come out of that confusion Among Us
[57:57] ing everybody else no okay then when you
[58:00] said that that automatically admitted
[58:02] you admitted you were the one that was
[58:03] guilty but that's the way it goes see
[58:06] you see come out let's serve god with
[58:09] one heart and one mind and one Accord is
[58:11] that right and then God will take his
[58:13] church over Jordan that's over death
[58:16] right Jordan was on top of death all
[58:18] right now come out
[58:21] come out of your Creeds
[58:23] come out of your self-style things and
[58:25] I'll receive you
[58:26] how do we come out God sent an angel a
[58:29] messenger to what call out come out the
[58:33] message of the hour see the message of
[58:35] this hour is calling us out of organized
[58:37] religion
[58:38] all right but it's not just now calling
[58:41] you and I out of the Baptist Methodist
[58:44] Presbyterian Etc Pentecostal is calling
[58:47] us out of the churches because it's a
[58:49] it's a bride out of a church right right
[58:51] you know where church is used correctly
[58:54] because this means called out
[58:56] right but then there's a difference then
[59:00] in the church
[59:01] in the bride right amen see the bride is
[59:05] called out of the church right you're
[59:07] using Church correctly it's okay but
[59:10] then when you come down to analyze what
[59:12] a church is and what it consists of it
[59:14] consists of man's ideas and doctrines
[59:18] all right now we should not hear should
[59:20] not have any trouble with thinking about
[59:22] whether or not the denominations are
[59:24] correct we know the placing we know what
[59:27] you know God has used each one coming
[59:29] down thank God for it we believe it but
[59:33] now we're into the message of the hour
[59:35] but now it's a a bride coming out of a
[59:38] church right
[59:40] and what has that been doing what have I
[59:43] been trying to preach to you
[59:45] the coming of the Lord
[59:47] been taking place ever since the day of
[59:50] Pentecost that's the way I believe it
[59:52] the second coming of Jesus Christ why
[59:54] because it's a bride coming of Christ
[59:56] coming out of the church
[59:59] now is this doing then we've got to come
[1:00:02] out our own of her own ideas
[1:00:06] thank you well I think well that's what
[1:00:08] happened to even the gardens
[1:00:11] that was the problem with her thinking
[1:00:13] see we've got to come out of that and
[1:00:16] the message of the hour is calling you
[1:00:19] and I the prophet back there was calling
[1:00:22] us out of organized religion you know
[1:00:25] out of the denominational churches no
[1:00:27] now God is calling us out of our own
[1:00:30] ideas
[1:00:31] like brother moat used to say about a
[1:00:33] good point he said we get our coat and
[1:00:35] hat we just change meeting places well
[1:00:39] but see it's no good to just do that
[1:00:42] this is a constant coming out amen I
[1:00:47] believe in it that's what I was trying
[1:00:49] to say then that you know when we start
[1:00:51] a year
[1:00:53] 39 years ago I was trying to say we're
[1:00:56] trying to come out
[1:00:57] right we're trying to come out of all
[1:01:00] man's ideas you say well you just formed
[1:01:03] your own
[1:01:04] well I've met it I'm not no one to back
[1:01:07] up
[1:01:08] when we came out of the the other
[1:01:11] churches and started the church
[1:01:14] we were trying to do the best we could
[1:01:17] but I still believe that the problem
[1:01:19] today is between our ears right
[1:01:22] and our thoughts about what we believe
[1:01:25] that's what I want us to be born out of
[1:01:29] it and that'll take the revealed word
[1:01:31] amen
[1:01:33] all right and that's what I've tried to
[1:01:35] do
[1:01:37] brother what was one of the most
[1:01:38] wonderful teachers on don't back up
[1:01:40] never have that he was the greatest of
[1:01:43] all the teachers of this message and
[1:01:45] I'll put him against all of them and if
[1:01:47] he was still here today and preaching
[1:01:48] somewhere and everybody you name who you
[1:01:51] want to I'd still go here brother Mo
[1:01:52] preach because I believe he was trying
[1:01:55] to bring the word of God to us all right
[1:01:59] let's see bringing the word to us is one
[1:02:02] thing
[1:02:03] but then letting that word be burnt in
[1:02:06] you and I am is another thing see we've
[1:02:09] got to be that's why the scripture says
[1:02:11] being being not born again being born
[1:02:15] again we're in a constant birth we're a
[1:02:18] constant coming out amen
[1:02:20] amen we've got to come out of our own
[1:02:21] idea see called out come out
[1:02:25] see
[1:02:26] be separate saith the Lord and I'll
[1:02:28] receive you touch not their unclean
[1:02:30] things the Church of God is called out
[1:02:32] of the world out of the chaos of the
[1:02:34] world
[1:02:36] see what are we doing
[1:02:40] we can come out of the world and come
[1:02:44] right into a church and still be the
[1:02:45] same thing right
[1:02:47] because the most worldly system that
[1:02:49] there is today is what
[1:02:52] what does America consist of
[1:02:54] the biggest percentage of Americans
[1:02:56] should consist of at least some form of
[1:02:57] religious
[1:02:59] principles or ideas
[1:03:01] but yet what is all of the doing what's
[1:03:04] everything in there can you tell the
[1:03:06] difference between the world and a
[1:03:08] Christian
[1:03:09] no
[1:03:11] see because you're still living just
[1:03:13] like the rest of the world Lily right
[1:03:17] you're still there I mean we go and we
[1:03:20] do to her we're here we work we make a
[1:03:23] living
[1:03:25] we've got to do all of the things of the
[1:03:28] world yes but we come out of the world
[1:03:31] as to where the world doesn't control us
[1:03:36] now we're all controlled by the world to
[1:03:38] a degree
[1:03:40] I mean if you don't think so don't go to
[1:03:42] work tomorrow you're not going to get
[1:03:44] paid right
[1:03:48] did he but see we're not trying to come
[1:03:51] out of that away
[1:03:53] is coming out of the things that that is
[1:03:56] controlling us to keep us tied to those
[1:03:59] things
[1:04:00] so it's the same with with the religious
[1:04:03] form that's why you don't hear me
[1:04:05] hollering the screaming messages about
[1:04:07] this Badness is wrong the message is
[1:04:09] wrong the catholic's wrong it's wrong no
[1:04:11] you and I what's wrong
[1:04:15] and I've tried my best to preach the
[1:04:16] truth to you over these 39 years
[1:04:20] to try to get you and I to see that we
[1:04:23] are the biggest organization in our
[1:04:27] individual cells that there is because
[1:04:28] that's what an organization is
[1:04:31] well brother Dale I've been in the
[1:04:33] message a long time we'll praise God how
[1:04:35] long has the message been in you
[1:04:38] right right amen are you being born
[1:04:41] again are you becoming just a hateful
[1:04:44] arrogant
[1:04:45] um you know I guess the most arrogant of
[1:04:48] all forms of religious movements would
[1:04:50] be like a Oneness form that's right are
[1:04:52] we just turning out to be a Oneness
[1:04:54] group of people that we've got it
[1:04:57] and you got to come to us you've never
[1:04:59] heard me say that
[1:05:01] I've never taught nothing like that
[1:05:04] I never thought that Lula is the only
[1:05:06] place
[1:05:09] if around the world the word of God is
[1:05:12] being revealed I got a thing to want to
[1:05:14] go but from those and being arrested
[1:05:16] there in what is it Iran which is really
[1:05:18] Iran isn't it and there was about
[1:05:21] they've got about 10 more that was
[1:05:23] arrested and I assume that they're
[1:05:24] Believers and and they're being arrested
[1:05:27] for what they believe well see we're
[1:05:28] sitting here under an independence
[1:05:31] freedom and at this point we're not
[1:05:33] being arrested but what about those
[1:05:34] right right but are we praying for those
[1:05:37] come on you know
[1:05:39] are we praying to to for God to deliver
[1:05:42] those people right
[1:05:44] right
[1:05:45] because they're putting their life on
[1:05:47] the line they might not know what you
[1:05:49] know about the message but if that is
[1:05:52] Believers the message is what's putting
[1:05:54] them in jail right
[1:05:56] right well thank God for our freedom to
[1:06:00] worry that we can exist
[1:06:03] right but see under that freedom is an
[1:06:07] opportunity also to relax
[1:06:10] right to become conformed to the world
[1:06:15] you see the scripture says for you to
[1:06:17] not be conformed to the world but be you
[1:06:19] transform what by the renewing right
[1:06:22] amen amen see by the opening of the word
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:26] revealed word that's why I've tried to
[1:06:29] preach the word to you for 39 years
[1:06:31] that's been my goal is to preach the
[1:06:35] word to you to get you to a word that
[1:06:37] you can see God right
[1:06:39] that's what I've always said to you I
[1:06:41] don't tell you what God does with me a
[1:06:43] lot of times because I don't want you
[1:06:44] built on me
[1:06:47] I want the word revealed in you right
[1:06:51] when that brother saw at that time and
[1:06:53] he's seen it many times he's seen the
[1:06:56] the pillar of fire here in the church
[1:06:58] it'd be up here at the front but then
[1:06:59] one day it was moving back to the
[1:07:01] congregation another brother said well
[1:07:03] it was leaving us well I didn't agree
[1:07:05] with that
[1:07:06] it was doing exactly what I was wanting
[1:07:08] it to be done I wanted to come out where
[1:07:10] you're at
[1:07:12] right I want the presence of the Lord to
[1:07:14] be in that seat where you're sitting
[1:07:15] right I go down these pews every day
[1:07:17] when I'm in here I go down with my hands
[1:07:19] hitting the fuse and saying Lord
[1:07:22] you touch these people
[1:07:24] you talk to these people you reveal
[1:07:27] yourself to them that's right
[1:07:29] why because it's not just me that's what
[1:07:32] I read that I want to go right around
[1:07:33] and said there's people right
[1:07:35] not just run around them with the
[1:07:37] message that was right he called us out
[1:07:39] right
[1:07:42] he called us out of it
[1:07:44] but now here's one thing that he
[1:07:46] couldn't do
[1:07:48] he can call you out the prophet could
[1:07:50] call you out right right because he can
[1:07:52] bring the message you know like we were
[1:07:54] talking about last night you can see
[1:07:55] maybe that organizations is wrong or
[1:07:58] this is wrong and you'll come out
[1:08:01] but if you don't get born again
[1:08:04] you're going to just come right out and
[1:08:06] form an organization just like everybody
[1:08:07] else is gone
[1:08:09] you're gonna come out and be just as bad
[1:08:11] as you was where you come from or even
[1:08:13] worse
[1:08:15] why because you're going to become
[1:08:16] highly religious right
[1:08:19] and you'll think you're right and you'll
[1:08:21] think you you know the thing today is
[1:08:23] not to repent right people don't want to
[1:08:25] repent no more how much time have you
[1:08:27] seen people repent
[1:08:31] you know of course they don't repent but
[1:08:33] see brother Brown could call us out
[1:08:36] right it's like Moses could bring the
[1:08:39] children of Israel out of Egypt
[1:08:43] all right
[1:08:44] when he did he smoked a rock it made an
[1:08:46] organization showed that he was not the
[1:08:49] one that was going to take him in
[1:08:52] right right he showed that because what
[1:08:56] he created
[1:08:57] but see Joshua took over
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:01] Joshua represents Holy Spirit right
[1:09:05] we believe God sent us a prophet amen
[1:09:09] and we've been called out of organized
[1:09:11] religion amen
[1:09:13] but what about the organizations in us
[1:09:17] only the Holy Spirit can show you and I
[1:09:21] what's wrong with us there is no
[1:09:23] preacher nobody nowhere can show us
[1:09:26] what's wrong with us right
[1:09:29] brother calling he could come to
[1:09:31] they don't want to talk to you he can
[1:09:33] sit down we could talk for two weeks
[1:09:37] if God don't show me
[1:09:39] when it's over with it'll be the same as
[1:09:41] it was amen
[1:09:43] it takes the Holy Spirit right because
[1:09:46] See Redemption brought around and said
[1:09:48] what Paradox 65
[1:09:51] . he said Redemption is in two parts
[1:09:55] out of
[1:09:57] and into amen
[1:10:00] you can be called out of organized
[1:10:03] religion that's right but have you went
[1:10:05] into Christ
[1:10:09] you know I think it's time I believe the
[1:10:12] message and you know that and all the
[1:10:14] years that I preached I've tried to read
[1:10:15] it to you and give it to your quotes and
[1:10:17] everything else to show you what brought
[1:10:19] around and say it
[1:10:20] I think it's time for us to start
[1:10:22] believing what he said amen amen and
[1:10:25] come out of ourselves and into Christ
[1:10:27] right amen
[1:10:29] come out of our ideas our opinions our
[1:10:32] thoughts
[1:10:33] and get into Christ
[1:10:35] see we can talk about what brother
[1:10:37] Brandon was amen we believe it
[1:10:39] but out up into right
[1:10:43] if we don't go into Christ I got a bunch
[1:10:46] of them wrote down through here where
[1:10:47] the Prophet said he's coming out and
[1:10:50] going into
[1:10:52] Now's the Time of coming out and going
[1:10:54] in getting out of those organizations
[1:10:56] and getting into Christ and coming out
[1:10:59] and going in time for all True Believers
[1:11:03] that's where we're at
[1:11:06] you're coming out of denominationalism
[1:11:08] to enter into the bride to go with the
[1:11:11] groom
[1:11:15] we're going into it going to it and
[1:11:19] we're in this Ephesus because that's
[1:11:21] what emphasis mean
[1:11:23] we're in this coming out of and one in
[1:11:27] one of one into another
[1:11:31] calling out is great we've been called
[1:11:33] out
[1:11:35] the prophet done his job but that
[1:11:37] Prophet could not put you into Christ
[1:11:41] now come on you say well no I've heard
[1:11:43] the prophet I believe the prophet I
[1:11:45] didn't stay with what the prophet said
[1:11:47] amen but when you're going into Christ
[1:11:48] that's right amen amen are you going to
[1:11:51] say that he's Christ
[1:11:53] now come on you know what I'm saying are
[1:11:54] you going to say that he's God that's
[1:11:56] going to take you in
[1:11:58] is your defendant spin up on that
[1:12:00] because I've never taught nothing like
[1:12:01] that out of the 39 years
[1:12:04] those messages that went around the
[1:12:06] country and split churches and things oh
[1:12:08] brother random got it man I used to go
[1:12:11] preach for a man
[1:12:13] he's dead now I'm going home but I used
[1:12:16] to preach for him he called my house
[1:12:17] probably at least once to twice a week
[1:12:20] he'd eat in my home he'd sit there we'd
[1:12:22] talk
[1:12:23] we were great friends
[1:12:25] you know I taught good Brothers in the
[1:12:27] Lord
[1:12:28] and one day I preached a little message
[1:12:30] here that
[1:12:32] brother random
[1:12:34] didn't have the revelation
[1:12:37] what I said was this way
[1:12:39] you've got to have it right that's right
[1:12:42] what he had he had right right but we've
[1:12:45] got to have that right revealed to us
[1:12:47] right
[1:12:48] and we've got to have a revelation he
[1:12:50] sent me word he said you won't preach no
[1:12:52] more for me he said in other words he
[1:12:54] said because I believe brother random
[1:12:57] had the Revelation that's my Revelation
[1:12:59] what he said the same thing I did he
[1:13:01] said he had a revelation he said he had
[1:13:03] a revelation he brought around I'm not a
[1:13:04] revelation but he said he didn't now no
[1:13:06] revelation
[1:13:07] all right I mean his own language was
[1:13:10] messed up
[1:13:11] but you see
[1:13:13] I believe that this message must be
[1:13:15] revealed to me amen I've never believed
[1:13:18] that it was going to church or believing
[1:13:21] that brother Adam was a prophet oh
[1:13:22] that's wonderful right if you don't do
[1:13:25] that there's something wrong with you
[1:13:26] amen right if you don't believe brother
[1:13:30] random was a prophet now if you've heard
[1:13:32] the message you know when you know the
[1:13:34] truth right
[1:13:37] Mr
[1:13:39] I keep wondering who you are
[1:13:42] I keep seeing that face back there
[1:13:47] but she favors somebody used to be in
[1:13:49] church here
[1:13:51] have you been here before
[1:13:52] okay I was thinking of somebody else
[1:13:54] like
[1:13:56] a really worse daughter
[1:13:58] but now listen
[1:14:01] see it's a coming out off
[1:14:03] but there's got to be a going into
[1:14:05] that's right right amen
[1:14:09] said you get your coat in handy this
[1:14:11] move houses
[1:14:13] that's coming out
[1:14:16] but what about the going into
[1:14:20] all right and Christ is the word
[1:14:24] is the word the most important thing
[1:14:26] that there is to you amen come on or is
[1:14:29] it just going to church and being good
[1:14:31] all of that's wonderful
[1:14:34] it's wonderful to do that
[1:14:37] are we getting into Christ come on
[1:14:40] and that's what I've tried to do
[1:14:42] you say well how's this connected I
[1:14:44] thought you were speaking on the the
[1:14:46] coming of the lord we see I believe the
[1:14:49] Lord's been coming right
[1:14:52] since the day of Pentecost Amen in the
[1:14:55] heart of ever born-again believer right
[1:14:57] what are you looking for a second coming
[1:15:00] well the Lord's going well
[1:15:02] the Lord don't descend from heaven like
[1:15:04] you're thinking he don't come down to
[1:15:07] earth like that because he doesn't set
[1:15:09] foot on Earth until the millennium
[1:15:12] we go to meet him in the air
[1:15:15] and I showed it to you from the
[1:15:16] prophet's message that the second coming
[1:15:18] of Jesus Christ is the rapture
[1:15:23] the second coming of Jesus Christ is the
[1:15:27] rapture why can't we meet him in the air
[1:15:29] okay
[1:15:31] jury becomes visible among us but
[1:15:33] visible doesn't mean Corporal right
[1:15:36] visual visible means apparent to the eye
[1:15:41] I've still got some things to preach on
[1:15:43] you know
[1:15:45] about the coming of the Lord and I
[1:15:47] believe the Lord's been coming amen
[1:15:49] I believe that the word has been
[1:15:51] preached here in Lula Georgia has
[1:15:53] brought some people
[1:15:55] to the position
[1:15:56] that their standing were the disciples
[1:15:59] were standing
[1:16:03] I'm gonna be blunt this morning
[1:16:06] I didn't say everybody I said I believe
[1:16:08] there's some here right that are
[1:16:10] standing where the apostles were
[1:16:11] standing brother asked me that here a
[1:16:13] while back said you believe we got the
[1:16:14] faith of the fathers I wouldn't talk
[1:16:16] about myself and I told him I wouldn't
[1:16:17] when I said I believe it's here
[1:16:20] I believe it's in the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:22] Christ around the world and now here
[1:16:24] comes that but I don't see it but I
[1:16:26] can't see it I don't believe it
[1:16:28] it looks good on them videos
[1:16:34] but it's true
[1:16:36] see people say I don't see it
[1:16:39] what do you mean it's because you don't
[1:16:42] see it
[1:16:43] okay
[1:16:44] brother walked down here one time
[1:16:45] talking to a man his name was Dozier
[1:16:47] dips enough you know but he
[1:16:49] that's when they first went to the moon
[1:16:51] George probably alive and she brought
[1:16:52] her milk because all of you heard me
[1:16:54] tell it anyway but you know when they
[1:16:56] first went to the moon well he said they
[1:16:58] didn't go to the Moon
[1:17:00] he said they went out you in the desert
[1:17:02] somewhere and they made pictures
[1:17:06] no way to convince him except one thing
[1:17:10] throw him in a spaceship and sent him to
[1:17:11] the Moon Yeah that would have been the
[1:17:14] only way he would have believed it
[1:17:16] he probably said I dreamed it
[1:17:20] but you see
[1:17:22] is the word being revealed to us right
[1:17:26] because that's the coming of the Lord
[1:17:28] amen the coming of the Lord is what
[1:17:31] the bride coming out of the church come
[1:17:33] on
[1:17:35] it's the coming of the Lord
[1:17:37] that's why it's been taking place
[1:17:40] I'll give you a key
[1:17:42] look around never spoke of the seventh
[1:17:44] seal as the word come
[1:17:48] he always used the word come in
[1:17:53] and write that down
[1:17:56] crying through preaching
[1:17:59] me
[1:18:00] but see the coming of the Lord is
[1:18:02] revealing of his word amen that's what
[1:18:04] happened on the Dead Penny College
[1:18:06] on the day of Pentecost in the upper
[1:18:10] room when the Holy Ghost fail it
[1:18:12] revealed the word quickened the word
[1:18:14] they had held five thousand outside or
[1:18:17] three of what it was heard the message
[1:18:22] and when they did it was revealed to
[1:18:24] them
[1:18:26] this is that as Peter said amen
[1:18:31] it's always been to revealing of his
[1:18:33] word Martin Luther when he received the
[1:18:35] Joshua live by faith that was a
[1:18:37] revealing of God's word that was the
[1:18:39] coming of the Lord to him
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:43] he said no he didn't come out of the
[1:18:45] Scottish that's what you're looking at
[1:18:48] you're still looking for them and if you
[1:18:51] don't hear it you don't believe it come
[1:18:55] right
[1:18:57] you can figure it out
[1:18:59] remember what I read in here
[1:19:01] you get it figured out you're wrong
[1:19:05] that's why people back there see there
[1:19:07] was there was lambasting us
[1:19:10] the man told me on the phone one day
[1:19:12] said you just don't ever didn't believe
[1:19:13] brother Adam I said well and what it was
[1:19:15] about was he said this Rapture that's
[1:19:17] going to come and and on Good Friday
[1:19:19] here in 1973.
[1:19:23] I said well
[1:19:26] he said you believe that he said that
[1:19:28] price is going to be in 73 on Good
[1:19:30] Friday that was about probably a month
[1:19:32] before the Indian Ocean
[1:19:35] Chevrolet man I hope so he said
[1:19:38] evidently you don't believe it
[1:19:41] I said well I just now got my my thing
[1:19:44] set on dates and things you know
[1:19:46] somebody he said well they do have it
[1:19:49] figured out
[1:19:50] now we just let people trap herself you
[1:19:52] know
[1:19:53] he said they do figure it out it can be
[1:19:55] 40 days later I said now you evidently
[1:19:58] don't believe it yourself because you
[1:19:59] got 40 days extra
[1:20:04] no that's what he was just saying
[1:20:06] but see I stood there
[1:20:08] in time in 74 improved by The Profit
[1:20:12] that we could pass the year 2026.
[1:20:18] I still got those takes to prove it that
[1:20:20] a priest did back there
[1:20:22] but how many people wants to hear about
[1:20:23] it
[1:20:24] oh they'll go around saying nobody
[1:20:26] didn't believe brother by him you know
[1:20:29] nobody didn't believe we'd be here this
[1:20:30] long but I didn't want us to be here
[1:20:33] but I preached what the prophet said
[1:20:36] and proved that we could be here right
[1:20:38] and you know what we're here
[1:20:41] okay all right well so evidently all of
[1:20:45] them predictions and dates and things
[1:20:47] must have been wrong
[1:20:49] because you know we're still here right
[1:20:51] but the word of God is still real amen
[1:20:55] amen God can speak to people and show
[1:20:58] them right and show the truth about it
[1:21:01] you see I believe that's the coming of
[1:21:03] the Lord is a revealing of the word to
[1:21:05] you
[1:21:07] Martin Luther will go into Rapture
[1:21:10] because of what was revealed to him back
[1:21:12] then you know what that would be to him
[1:21:14] the second coming
[1:21:17] do you know where Martin Luther is going
[1:21:19] to meet him in the air
[1:21:21] but he's going to be raised and be here
[1:21:24] Among Us
[1:21:27] per 30 40-day period of time amen
[1:21:30] and then we'll all go to meet the Lord
[1:21:32] in here right
[1:21:33] you said but brother Dale I've always
[1:21:35] believed the second coming was some kind
[1:21:37] of a something
[1:21:38] Caleb well the words you get it that run
[1:21:41] around never targeted right
[1:21:45] the Bible never taught it
[1:21:47] your Prophet said we'd meet him in there
[1:21:49] the Bible says we'll meet him in there
[1:21:51] now where did we get the idea from our
[1:21:54] organizations
[1:21:56] from our own minds
[1:21:59] and our thoughts
[1:22:01] and that's what I was trying to tell the
[1:22:04] people back then I said that's all we're
[1:22:05] going to try to do we're going to try to
[1:22:07] go beyond man's Camp because if Jesus
[1:22:09] Christ is without the Gate of the church
[1:22:10] then that's where I want to be
[1:22:13] you said well you've got a church here
[1:22:14] well that's right we've got a church
[1:22:16] here
[1:22:17] so we gotta have a place to meet
[1:22:20] me all right we've got a house no more
[1:22:23] to go
[1:22:24] that's what not the price not what the
[1:22:26] problem that's where he said it's not
[1:22:28] coming out of your church
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:32] he never tried to get nobody to come out
[1:22:34] of the church
[1:22:36] he said you stay there and let your
[1:22:39] light shine
[1:22:40] now watch it
[1:22:42] here's where they'll quote the other
[1:22:43] part won't don't want to quote that part
[1:22:45] he said you let your light shine and
[1:22:47] they'll throw you out that's right man
[1:22:50] right that's right that's right he said
[1:22:53] they'll put you out
[1:22:54] why because they're going out to your
[1:22:56] shoulder and where the Count's at
[1:22:58] all right but you see I want to be where
[1:23:00] God is at and God is in the revealed
[1:23:02] word amen
[1:23:04] that's all I've ever tried to do I've
[1:23:06] never been against anybody I've defended
[1:23:08] all of these brothers over the years
[1:23:10] that would be preaching thing and
[1:23:11] telling you no that's not what they're
[1:23:13] saying
[1:23:16] they're trying to preach something to us
[1:23:19] they didn't know how
[1:23:22] but not knowing how to bring it
[1:23:25] they cause two Souls seventh on The
[1:23:27] Virtue bruise River Jordan they caused
[1:23:29] all kind of Doctrine
[1:23:31] but not knowing how to preach the word
[1:23:33] and handle the truth
[1:23:34] if we were covering last night to where
[1:23:36] the scripture said how can he preach
[1:23:38] unless he'd be sent right amen
[1:23:41] you know if you're not sin of God how
[1:23:43] can you preach the truth
[1:23:46] how you can mimic it
[1:23:48] quoted right
[1:23:50] but don't worry about it
[1:23:52] it's gonna go off
[1:23:55] you said well people today has got the
[1:23:57] pure adulterate word only if it's
[1:23:59] revealed right
[1:24:02] we have the pure renovated unadulterated
[1:24:05] Bible
[1:24:07] before the Prophet come on the scene to
[1:24:09] start preaching to us right he didn't
[1:24:11] get us a new one
[1:24:14] we just didn't know what it said right
[1:24:16] we had it misinterpreted amen
[1:24:20] he come to show us the correct
[1:24:21] understanding
[1:24:23] he couldn't reveal it as I said while
[1:24:25] ago
[1:24:27] the Lord Jesus brother Raymond says
[1:24:29] quote
[1:24:30] that the Lord Jesus said even my own
[1:24:32] life did not reveal that unto me but my
[1:24:35] Father which is in heaven the Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] is the only revealer of the word right
[1:24:39] that's why someone can call you out but
[1:24:42] they cannot take you in right Moses
[1:24:44] could call the people out take them out
[1:24:47] and through the Wilderness but he could
[1:24:50] not put him in the promised land right
[1:24:52] his greater profit as he was he formed
[1:24:55] an organization
[1:24:57] can't you see
[1:24:59] that the human mortal there's no way no
[1:25:02] human mortal that's right brother random
[1:25:05] or whoever
[1:25:06] can take us in
[1:25:10] right he said well you're against
[1:25:11] brother Randleman well that's where your
[1:25:13] mentality is messed up right
[1:25:18] I believe he called us out amen
[1:25:21] it was God using him because the Lord
[1:25:24] himself descended from heaven with a
[1:25:26] shout but that was not brother Branham
[1:25:30] the message that come through him
[1:25:34] which the Lord's descending not brother
[1:25:37] random descending right amen
[1:25:40] what was the message he was praying
[1:25:44] the word of God because only the Holy
[1:25:47] Ghost can reveal that unto us
[1:25:52] where would we be without this message
[1:25:54] right that's right amen right in every
[1:25:57] organization just like all the rest of
[1:25:58] them right but then have we come out of
[1:26:01] that to be able to disform others
[1:26:04] when you form an organization what you
[1:26:06] do is you draw a guideline and you pull
[1:26:08] it in and you say this is what we
[1:26:10] believe and we don't take no more
[1:26:15] you better end that with a comma
[1:26:18] and say anything else the Lord reveals
[1:26:20] right amen and he may reveal that to
[1:26:23] somebody that you don't even think is in
[1:26:25] the word
[1:26:29] it might be a surprise for me right to
[1:26:33] find out who really makes it
[1:26:36] but do you understanding what I'm saying
[1:26:37] see amen I have been trying my best to
[1:26:40] get us to come out
[1:26:43] now I can't take you into Christ I'm
[1:26:46] sorry
[1:26:48] but I think it's time to get into Christ
[1:26:52] I think it's time to get out of our
[1:26:54] ideas and repent of our lives and our
[1:26:57] ways and do it and let Christ come on
[1:26:59] the scene Amen Brother Gary and I are
[1:27:02] talking about something the Lord spoke
[1:27:03] to him the other day it's not your
[1:27:05] goodness it's going to bring him to you
[1:27:06] to speak to you
[1:27:08] but now if he'd have been down in The
[1:27:11] Honky Tonk yeah
[1:27:13] drunk is just
[1:27:15] oh hog
[1:27:17] now I don't think God's gonna do that
[1:27:19] speak to you you know what
[1:27:23] I ain't speaking you get out of the hot
[1:27:25] pen yeah
[1:27:27] but he's not going to speak this message
[1:27:30] to you to get you ready for a rapture
[1:27:34] no you got to get you out of the hog pin
[1:27:37] first
[1:27:39] right amen
[1:27:41] but then
[1:27:43] he can just come on the scene when he
[1:27:44] wants to that's right man
[1:27:46] he's sovereign
[1:27:53] you know right
[1:27:56] man but you know what
[1:27:58] I have to depend on somebody right you
[1:28:01] know
[1:28:03] brother random addict depend on somebody
[1:28:06] I have to depend on somebody I have to
[1:28:09] depend on the five-fold ministry
[1:28:12] listen
[1:28:15] I listen to people that when I get
[1:28:17] through I think well
[1:28:19] you know I didn't want to be derogatory
[1:28:22] and argue with him but I just didn't
[1:28:23] believe what monster went to brought
[1:28:29] and I don't listen to argue
[1:28:32] don't ever do that
[1:28:34] the Russian people only waiting for you
[1:28:36] to shut up long enough where they can
[1:28:37] refute what you're saying right that's
[1:28:39] what he said
[1:28:41] yeah
[1:28:43] but you see it's like I was talking to a
[1:28:46] man here a while back and he kept on he
[1:28:47] kept on and I just finally kept nailing
[1:28:50] one scripture not in one scripture
[1:28:54] after a while he said
[1:28:57] all right
[1:28:59] because he saw I was just going to stay
[1:29:00] on that one scripture right because that
[1:29:04] scripture told us exactly what's going
[1:29:06] on right
[1:29:09] but do you understand what I'm saying I
[1:29:11] believe that down through time
[1:29:13] has been the coming of the Lord
[1:29:16] and I believe we started here in 71 July
[1:29:20] the 4th and I believe that the word that
[1:29:23] I've been trying to bring to you is the
[1:29:25] word of the Lord
[1:29:27] I've had to correct some things and I
[1:29:29] taught myself
[1:29:32] and I come to you and correct them
[1:29:35] the Lord corrects me I'll come to you
[1:29:37] and tell you it's uncorrected
[1:29:40] I mean that's that's just the way it is
[1:29:42] I used to believe that that was about
[1:29:44] your uh theophany
[1:29:48] and uh
[1:29:50] but I found out one day the prophet said
[1:29:52] the office don't eat
[1:29:56] huh well I appreciate that away
[1:30:00] yeah
[1:30:03] but I found out when we get over in
[1:30:05] heaven they might change a lot of things
[1:30:07] you know because we're all going to be
[1:30:09] together Body Spirit and soul we need
[1:30:11] 10. sure when I see something that
[1:30:14] corrects now I'll come tell you that's
[1:30:16] right I'll make a correction on the tape
[1:30:18] you know I'm gonna say that's it now
[1:30:20] I used to believe this but don't believe
[1:30:22] it no more
[1:30:24] right
[1:30:25] but I believe the coming of the Lord is
[1:30:27] revealing Thy Word
[1:30:29] or if I didn't believe that there would
[1:30:31] be no need of me coming to church
[1:30:36] if you don't need of us together and if
[1:30:37] I didn't believe that we were coming to
[1:30:39] hear from God that's right and when
[1:30:41] anybody comes here to preach that's the
[1:30:44] way I pray amen
[1:30:46] I pray Lord
[1:30:47] use that brother to speak to the people
[1:30:51] and most of all use them to speak to me
[1:30:54] that's right amen well you know a whole
[1:30:58] lot more than he does I didn't pray that
[1:31:00] away that's right
[1:31:02] I'm not deferred the guy that was
[1:31:04] standing there saying Lord I fast all
[1:31:06] this I do all these things I'm not like
[1:31:08] that fella over there no right I'm that
[1:31:11] Feller over there that said God forgive
[1:31:13] me
[1:31:14] amen and I'm crying out for him to feed
[1:31:16] me when I go anywhere right I'm praying
[1:31:20] for God to feed me amen
[1:31:22] why go if you're not
[1:31:28] and I believe it I believe this has been
[1:31:31] a coming out
[1:31:33] we spent 39 years coming out I think
[1:31:35] it's about time to get into
[1:31:40] it's about time to get into Christ
[1:31:45] because that's what he's coming back for
[1:31:50] you you're and me are not so goody goody
[1:31:53] that he's coming back after us
[1:31:58] that's right you know
[1:32:01] larger no he's coming back after himself
[1:32:07] because it's not you anyway it's him in
[1:32:10] you right he's coming back after himself
[1:32:13] in you because that's what he made the
[1:32:15] promise that's where he gave you the
[1:32:16] Holy Ghost so he's coming back after the
[1:32:19] Holy Ghost to take it in the Rapture you
[1:32:22] and I get to Ride Along
[1:32:27] because it's not that we're going to be
[1:32:29] so goody goody no
[1:32:33] I think one thing we are going to be
[1:32:35] we're going to be forgiven amen amen
[1:32:39] we're going to be sincere enough to be
[1:32:41] asked for forgiveness
[1:32:43] come out and go in come out and go in
[1:32:48] and brother Gary he told me
[1:32:51] he told me one time he said brother Dave
[1:32:53] I see it he said this is all of it I
[1:32:55] said no brother if you hurry I'm sorry
[1:32:58] you know
[1:33:00] I didn't want to bust his bubble yeah
[1:33:03] I mean he was sincere
[1:33:05] I said what you've got is the foundation
[1:33:10] and it took him a while to kind of
[1:33:13] swallow that
[1:33:15] I you know you say well how did you know
[1:33:18] it was just this Foundation because what
[1:33:20] I've got today
[1:33:22] tomorrow comes what I've got today is a
[1:33:26] foundation
[1:33:28] and tomorrow God can give me as we'll do
[1:33:31] in the communion
[1:33:33] he can give me my daily bread
[1:33:37] thank you
[1:33:38] now one reason and I said it's because
[1:33:41] me and him wouldn't go on the rapture
[1:33:43] now if he'd called me up and he said
[1:33:45] brother Dale this is it there's not no
[1:33:47] more and me and him both lifted off the
[1:33:49] Earth I'd agree with him
[1:33:51] 100.
[1:33:53] right right didn't happen
[1:33:56] so I said Brother Gary what you've seen
[1:33:58] is a foundation
[1:34:00] wonderful thing but it's a foundation
[1:34:03] now ask him about it now to see what's
[1:34:05] happened since then
[1:34:07] that the Lord has revealed to him
[1:34:10] but each time the Lord reveals something
[1:34:11] to you remember it's a foundation all
[1:34:14] right it's a foundation for something
[1:34:16] else right man because if not
[1:34:20] we're going to walk off one of these
[1:34:22] days there'll be somebody to get the
[1:34:23] revelation
[1:34:25] because the prophet said the Rapture is
[1:34:27] a revelation the bride be waiting on the
[1:34:28] revelations rapture
[1:34:30] and it's going to come
[1:34:32] and we're going to get it we're going to
[1:34:33] walk off the earth then it won't be
[1:34:35] going up in the air and I think this is
[1:34:37] it it'll be the fact of what you know
[1:34:39] right you see I believe
[1:34:42] that what I've tried to do is to preach
[1:34:44] you and I to a position
[1:34:46] because it's been my goal
[1:34:48] a position
[1:34:50] to be waiting for God to pick us up
[1:34:54] because I always say to you don't go
[1:34:57] down to the bus depot waiting on the
[1:35:00] train
[1:35:02] right
[1:35:04] go to the train station
[1:35:07] get the statue
[1:35:09] find out what's the time it's going to
[1:35:11] leave
[1:35:12] and then don't go buy your hamburger
[1:35:14] across the street if you're supposed to
[1:35:16] leave in five minutes
[1:35:19] okay
[1:35:20] the most contrary to popular opinion
[1:35:24] God he can do without us that's right
[1:35:27] that's wrong way of saying it but he
[1:35:29] knew how to us
[1:35:31] and I can't do without him
[1:35:34] my dependence has always been on them if
[1:35:37] we're around here another 10 years if we
[1:35:39] made it another 40.
[1:35:41] you would hear me saying the same thing
[1:35:48] not just because I preached 26 you know
[1:35:51] 2026 we could go there I never had any
[1:35:54] intention of thinking we'd ever get to
[1:35:55] our note
[1:35:57] I was just proving we could
[1:36:00] but see the way I see it now we could be
[1:36:02] here
[1:36:03] to five thousand and not break God's
[1:36:06] word
[1:36:08] of course me and you ain't gonna be here
[1:36:14] right right you see because when I see
[1:36:17] it now
[1:36:19] what I was doing then was saying 7 7 is
[1:36:22] 49.
[1:36:24] and I was adding 49 on to
[1:36:27] 1977.
[1:36:30] they had to come out to be somewhere
[1:36:32] around 2026.
[1:36:35] all right
[1:36:36] let's see where I see it now
[1:36:39] eternity amen because in 1977 was a 70th
[1:36:43] Jubilee your prostate City since the
[1:36:44] beginning of Jubilation making exactly 3
[1:36:46] 430 years he said it'd be the going up
[1:36:49] of the Gentile Brighton and the return
[1:36:51] of Christ to the Jews when they go out
[1:36:52] of bondage
[1:36:53] what the Jubilee not the year
[1:36:57] amen the Jubilee
[1:37:01] your profit coming to 49.
[1:37:05] declaring Liberty for the 50.
[1:37:09] I think it's time for us to start saying
[1:37:13] Prophet said to be true
[1:37:17] you say well I believe it and I say it
[1:37:19] but do we really is it reveal
[1:37:24] this
[1:37:26] we're going to take we're doing kind of
[1:37:28] different today because we're not having
[1:37:29] one service sorry
[1:37:31] so we're going to have communion but now
[1:37:32] we're not going to have foot worship
[1:37:33] we're going to have communion okay it's
[1:37:36] a different situation because we're not
[1:37:37] going to be here this afternoon
[1:37:40] go downstairs and have a meal and eat
[1:37:42] together and enjoy and fellowship around
[1:37:44] a natural meal and it won't be an
[1:37:47] evening service we'll be here you know
[1:37:49] for whatever time you want to be
[1:37:52] and fellowshipping and talking about the
[1:37:54] word of the Lord and what I would wish
[1:37:56] you would do would do what I said
[1:37:59] think about what's been revealed to you
[1:38:03] okay
[1:38:06] sometimes you just sit down and think oh
[1:38:08] here
[1:38:09] I think I shouldn't say it but I will
[1:38:10] anyway what a lot of people do they come
[1:38:13] to a place they like Lula and I've
[1:38:15] watched it for many years
[1:38:17] and they come here and they don't know a
[1:38:20] whole lot about the message they know
[1:38:21] the quote but not the real deal
[1:38:25] well then after a while they begin to
[1:38:27] catch on to what's going on and they
[1:38:28] begin to see the review work the first
[1:38:32] thing you know they become
[1:38:34] one's there
[1:38:36] realizing they got it yeah instead of
[1:38:39] realizing where we get it from right
[1:38:42] I get mine from the profits connection
[1:38:44] and I get it from the five-fold ministry
[1:38:46] right and they break it down to you
[1:38:49] see that doesn't take me anywhere it may
[1:38:51] be anything different you see then what
[1:38:53] people will do they seem to forget that
[1:38:56] when they came here
[1:39:01] I seem to forget when they came here
[1:39:03] they didn't know what's going on
[1:39:07] yep
[1:39:09] like I saw the last night in the Bible
[1:39:10] study you know question was asked you
[1:39:14] know how do you introduce the message or
[1:39:16] whatever
[1:39:18] I should first off remember where you
[1:39:19] come from amen
[1:39:22] right and I said I've been around here
[1:39:25] long enough to know that a lot of people
[1:39:27] here
[1:39:29] that it took me six months to pound them
[1:39:31] hard
[1:39:32] to get them to see maybe one little
[1:39:35] point
[1:39:37] and I said when they're killing
[1:39:39] everybody else down the road later I
[1:39:41] don't see why you can't see this because
[1:39:43] I've seen it immediately
[1:39:45] well I'm sorry
[1:39:48] I'm sorry that I'm just blunt I
[1:39:50] shouldn't be that hurt stealing
[1:39:53] what true her feelings do I have
[1:39:56] anything to do with this situation yeah
[1:39:57] damn it I know what it took for for the
[1:40:00] most Compound on me
[1:40:04] and I never come in the message saying I
[1:40:06] believe this all alone yeah
[1:40:12] I came into Mexicans like everybody else
[1:40:14] right
[1:40:14] right the revealed word then just want
[1:40:17] to take care of all those right
[1:40:19] we give credit where credit is due
[1:40:23] because I believe in the final Ministry
[1:40:26] amen for sure for the Perfection of the
[1:40:28] science
[1:40:31] and I've always said this
[1:40:34] if we knew where there was a real true
[1:40:36] prophet in the final four Ministry now
[1:40:38] you understand the process and fossil
[1:40:40] Ministry
[1:40:41] are you talking about going out getting
[1:40:42] another church information during
[1:40:43] nothing like that I'm talking about a
[1:40:46] profit in the faithful Ministry if
[1:40:47] you'll show me where one day I'll give
[1:40:49] you to come in right
[1:40:51] but you better remember you'll have
[1:40:53] freely free freedom to stand here and
[1:40:56] call out our name call our team right
[1:41:03] brother came here one time and he said
[1:41:05] you better watch that person I said no
[1:41:08] okay
[1:41:10] he said but I'm telling you you better
[1:41:11] watch it I said brother I know all about
[1:41:14] it
[1:41:17] it was just a comfort for God to speak
[1:41:19] to him to tell me something I already
[1:41:22] knew
[1:41:26] but Lucifer
[1:41:28] I believe this is a coming out Now's the
[1:41:31] Time To Go in yes a Rapture is waiting
[1:41:34] you and I a change of these bodies and
[1:41:37] it'd only be done by the reveal word
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:42] what was it the other day that uh let's

[1:42:11] the United Nations to bring one world

[1:42:15] shined it over to whatever they say

[1:42:50] son of it it's a choice
[1:42:52] we've been around her a long time and we
[1:42:55] can't put an ounce on that yeah
[1:42:58] I've thought about time rocks around her
[1:43:00] neck just get it away but
[1:43:04] okay
[1:43:05] I love to eat remember I love to eat
[1:43:08] natural I love to eat damn it
[1:43:10] I don't mean that because Joyce is a
[1:43:12] pretty good eater I at least don't
[1:43:14] understand where to go amen
[1:43:17] but you see
[1:43:20] we have some of the best people in the
[1:43:22] world that's right
[1:43:24] thank God for you believe that
[1:43:26] thank God for all them meals you've made
[1:43:28] and all the time yep
[1:43:30] it's been wonderful
[1:43:32] 39 years that we've been here I took
[1:43:35] over in 1975 as pastor
[1:43:39] from that time until now I've tried to
[1:43:41] preach the truth to you amen I was
[1:43:43] trying back to her to do it
[1:43:46] remote and I preached together for
[1:43:48] 71 until 75.
[1:43:52] when you got sick he stepped down
[1:43:56] but you see I've tried
[1:43:58] to just move on
[1:44:00] and that's all I want us to do
[1:44:03] you might not agree with my actions and
[1:44:06] my ways that's fine I don't agree with
[1:44:07] everything
[1:44:10] that's honest
[1:44:12] it's not bad it's going to put us in
[1:44:14] Rapture that's right this should reveal
[1:44:15] a word
[1:44:16] none donkey told a prophet one time what
[1:44:19] to do right
[1:44:25] that's right
[1:44:28] so we've been released
[1:44:31] let's just go right into the communion
[1:44:33] and second Corinth First Corinthians 11.
[1:44:36] 23.
[1:44:39] Brown received of the Lord that which
[1:44:40] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:44:42] Jesus is saying not in which he was
[1:44:44] betrayed good bread and when he had
[1:44:46] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:44:48] Heat this is my body which is broken for
[1:44:50] you this doing remembers for me after
[1:44:53] the same manner also he took the cut
[1:44:55] when he had some saying this cup is the
[1:44:57] New Testament in my blood this New
[1:44:59] Year's office you drink it in
[1:45:00] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:45:03] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:45:05] shoe the Lord said till he come
[1:45:06] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:45:09] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:45:10] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:45:13] and blood of the lord we let a man
[1:45:15] examine himself and so they didn't
[1:45:17] either that bread and drink of that cup
[1:45:18] see that's what we're going to do
[1:45:19] examine ourselves not me Examining you
[1:45:22] it's mid-ground in my own self right but
[1:45:26] he doesn't drink up unworldly he doesn't
[1:45:28] drink his damnation to himself not
[1:45:30] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:45:32] caused many a week and sickly among you
[1:45:34] in many sleep
[1:45:36] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:45:39] now this is the scripture I like but
[1:45:41] when we are judged right
[1:45:45] even for wrong
[1:45:47] and we're judged and God will judges
[1:45:51] but when we are judged we are chasing to
[1:45:53] the Lord one that we should not be
[1:45:55] condemned with the world we're for my
[1:45:58] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:45:59] tired one for another and if they man
[1:46:01] hunger let him eat a home that you come
[1:46:03] not together under condemnation
[1:46:05] and the rest will sit in order
[1:46:07] when I come let's just have a few
[1:46:10] moments of solid prayer praying for one
[1:46:12] another if you want the prophet said
[1:46:14] pray for your passion yes
[1:46:17] and for one another
[1:46:35] we love you and thank you
[1:46:37] you made it all man be your hands and
[1:46:40] believe in you
[1:46:41] in Jesus name
[1:46:47] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:46:49] father we thank you for this bread it
[1:46:51] was made for this purpose today
[1:46:53] and now as we come to this point we know
[1:46:56] that this is not the literal body but it
[1:46:58] is a representation
[1:47:01] it means really your word Lord
[1:47:05] as we eat this bread
[1:47:07] we think about you and what you've done
[1:47:09] all the way through the word to bring us
[1:47:11] to a place that we can stand here you
[1:47:14] know if you're on adulterated Mason
[1:47:15] you're the hour and waiting upon a
[1:47:18] change of these vile bodies that we live
[1:47:20] in we love you we thank you sanctify the
[1:47:22] bread and the protectors in Jesus name
[1:47:29] I always think the children of Israel
[1:47:33] and we're leaving out of Egypt
[1:47:36] last thing they've done
[1:47:39] to continue
[1:47:41] Prophet said we get over there
[1:47:44] marriage supper
[1:47:47] he'll be the comedian
[1:47:50] you know be a wonderful kind of one
[1:47:53] you know we won't have to be worried
[1:47:55] about
[1:47:56] downstairs and eat and what we're going
[1:47:58] to eat and what we're going to do it'll
[1:48:00] all be pretty well over with by then we
[1:48:02] can just sit back and have a good time
[1:48:03] and you know not being on prayer and
[1:48:06] just
[1:48:07] let the Lord take care of everything and
[1:48:10] you know
[1:48:11] I'll be done
[1:48:13] Prophet said you look across the table
[1:48:16] and you'll see the people that made it
[1:48:19] he said then he can reach over and wipe
[1:48:21] the tears from her eyes
[1:48:23] you know
[1:48:24] we could see him
[1:48:26] wonderful time
[1:48:28] all the types and shatters of now being
[1:48:31] fulfilled
[1:48:33] here in our presence
[1:48:35] in the end of time
[1:48:41] father we thank you for additional Hindi
[1:48:43] that went through the process and gets
[1:48:45] better each day as we eat a little piece
[1:48:48] of bread we drink this little part of
[1:48:50] wine Lord
[1:48:51] than ever be in our bodies to make blood
[1:48:54] cells for us tomorrow
[1:48:56] and we would literally be living off
[1:48:58] this
[1:48:58] but we know these things are only to an
[1:49:01] example because this is not your blood
[1:49:04] this is wine but it represents your
[1:49:07] blood to stimulate
[1:49:09] the makers
[1:49:10] one with you we love you and we ask you
[1:49:13] sanctify the wine and the protectors in
[1:49:15] Jesus name
[1:49:21] foreign
[1:49:53] for me
[1:50:00] and rejected
[1:50:03] and my question
[1:50:06] oh Father
[1:50:12] then I tell you
[1:50:17] at Mount Calvary
[1:50:21] and it gives me the strength to go on
[1:50:27] you believe it
[1:50:29] um morning the prophet said some morning
[1:50:32] between six and nine
[1:50:36] Something's Gonna take place
[1:50:50] through the midnight
[1:51:01] the children of Israel I really enjoyed
[1:51:03] that when we were in this project
[1:51:06] and I wrote it in my Bible sometimes you
[1:51:09] can look at it it was about three or
[1:51:11] four of the songs
[1:51:13] that they always sang as they were
[1:51:17] entering the temple
[1:51:19] you know
[1:51:21] well you know
[1:51:22] that would be a wonderful thing to think
[1:51:24] about
[1:51:26] those songs
[1:51:28] because the songs there the whole Bible
[1:51:30] can be sung if it's put into the form of
[1:51:33] thinking because it is the songs you
[1:51:36] know
[1:51:37] in those people as they were entering
[1:51:40] the temple they would be singing them
[1:51:42] song
[1:51:43] well can't you see them
[1:51:45] that it would be
[1:51:47] not a mass confusion but here's one
[1:51:50] group that's up ahead nursing
[1:51:53] another group that's back in another and
[1:51:55] they're saying
[1:51:56] another one in another
[1:51:58] and it's coming down
[1:52:01] you know to all but you know when we all
[1:52:04] get there and be the same song
[1:52:06] We'll All finish up
[1:52:09] singing those hymns
[1:52:12] would be a wonderful time
[1:52:33] thank you
[1:52:37] you're stuck on these things
[1:52:40] remember now that things that I've
[1:52:42] announced and what we'll be doing I'll
[1:52:44] be trying to preach when you see that
[1:52:46] yeah we
[1:52:49] brought the tied up back that afternoon
