[20:19] next sunday afternoon we're going to set
[20:21] up the new baptistry and we're going to
[20:23] anybody that wants to be baptized i
[20:24] think we already have about five or six
[20:27] that are going to be baptized and
[20:28] re-baptized
[20:30] but we're going to do that next sunday
[20:32] after the first service
[20:34] we will have a baptismal service
[20:38] what we may do is go if anybody wants to
[20:39] go eat or we just may have it directly
[20:41] afterwards so we'll just talk about that
[20:44] we'll decide that next sunday it won't
[20:46] matter one way or the other but uh if
[20:48] you want to go get something deep maybe
[20:49] or we'll just start right into the
[20:52] second part of the service which will be
[20:53] a baptismal service and like i said
[20:55] there's five or six gonna be baptized
[20:58] um sister uh corinna will be here from
[21:00] ohio she's to get baptized along with
[21:02] some of the other ones that have
[21:03] expressed
[21:05] interest to being baptized and being
[21:06] baptized again it
[21:08] it it it's just a good conscious
[21:11] thing to do
[21:13] if you have
[21:14] if you don't know like
[21:16] i was baptized
[21:18] long time ago as a kid i really didn't
[21:20] know what i was doing i did it because i
[21:21] think somebody else had it somebody else
[21:23] got it but i want to do it make sure
[21:25] that i did it so i had brother dale do
[21:27] it again when i was older
[21:29] and we want to make that as a good
[21:31] conscience to the lord
[21:33] and something that the devil can't say
[21:34] well that person that baptized you is
[21:36] now in the world there's a lot of a lot
[21:38] of people that have been baptized that
[21:40] the message people person is not even
[21:42] the message anymore so
[21:43] to have a good conscience if you want to
[21:45] be baptized we're going to
[21:46] baptize anyone that wants to be baptized
[21:49] next sunday after
[21:51] the first service has everybody got that

[22:16] hamburgers and hot dogs there
[22:18] on the uh around the pond and just
[22:21] fellowship there
[22:22] on that saturday also july the 3rd
[22:25] remember brother chris long will be
[22:26] preaching for us our anniversary 51st
[22:29] anniversary meeting will be just on
[22:31] sunday we'll have two services on sunday
[22:32] and then we will eat a meal after
[22:35] that
[22:36] and we'll get together on all that i
[22:37] know that's a month or so away
[22:39] but i try to announce these so you can
[22:41] understand that we're having something
[22:42] later on in the month and make your
[22:44] plans for it
[22:45] also july the 22nd through the 25th
[22:48] we'll be going to ohio as i see now
[22:51] there's 42 people have signed up which
[22:54] is wonderful
[22:55] they about fell over in ohio because i
[22:57] told them maybe they won't be about 25
[22:59] people show up so he's going to be 42
[23:02] some are going to drive
[23:04] some are going to fly but we're going to
[23:06] um
[23:07] i called two
[23:09] trailway bus places and our charter bus
[23:12] places and
[23:14] um
[23:15] they can only drive 10 hours at a time
[23:17] so we'd have to stop get a motel
[23:20] have another day there another day back
[23:23] so we're just going to rent two vans
[23:26] and that puts 20. if we get two 15
[23:29] passenger vans that's 29 people riding
[23:32] in the in van two vans so we'll do that
[23:35] and if you still want to go now if you
[23:36] don't want to go you need to let us know
[23:40] all right if you're not if you're still
[23:41] on this list and you don't want to go
[23:43] now that we've changed a little bit i
[23:44] know some of you wanted to get on the
[23:46] bus but that's okay
[23:48] because
[23:50] we'd have to leave a day early you'd
[23:52] have to pay a motel bill an extra two
[23:54] motel nights
[23:55] they just can't drive over 10 hours they
[23:57] can double up but it's it's way
[23:59] expensive to do that they have to send
[24:01] the driver 10 hours up put him in a
[24:02] motel
[24:03] and then he picks up and drives on and
[24:05] you gotta pay for that guy to come back
[24:06] here then you gotta do that when you
[24:08] come back
[24:09] so it's about fourteen hundred dollars
[24:10] extra
[24:12] to drive straight through so we can rent
[24:14] a couple of vans
[24:15] almost for that
[24:17] but if you still want to do it there's
[24:19] there's room if we have to get three
[24:20] we'll get three but we'll we'll work on
[24:23] that later on but just keep that in your
[24:25] heart we will leave sometime
[24:27] late thursday night or early friday
[24:29] morning it's a good 12 hour trip
[24:31] and then when we get finished monday
[24:33] we'll leave monday morning
[24:35] we'll have a youth service on saturday
[24:37] and then we'll have a
[24:38] one church service on sunday and then
[24:40] have fellowship
[24:41] afterwards so
[24:43] just keep that in your prayers and
[24:45] we're trying to look for some airbnb so
[24:47] that people can stay together and not
[24:49] have to be in a motel room so we're
[24:50] working on that
[24:52] uh there's not many big houses up there
[24:54] but they are on lake erie and they are
[24:55] really pretty so i'm trying to i'm
[24:58] working on that so maybe when i get up
[24:59] there this coming week
[25:01] uh that's probably one of the purposes
[25:03] i'm gonna go one of them is to check out
[25:05] the place in the facility and where we
[25:06] can stay
[25:07] and all that other stuff so but we will
[25:10] probably have a church service here that
[25:12] we can um and whoever's
[25:16] left behind
[25:19] i didn't want to say it like that but
[25:21] whoever's left
[25:22] will have a church service we talk about
[25:24] playing a tape but but maybe if
[25:26] if some are not going then we might just
[25:28] have a we just have a regular church
[25:30] service just keep that in your prayers
[25:31] so and also sister mary kamani sent a
[25:33] message i know some of you may have got
[25:35] it on whatsapp
[25:36] but her maids got the bad cold and now
[25:38] she has that same bad cold
[25:41] um her right hip is hurting and it hurts
[25:44] when she sits you know she's had that
[25:46] accident she's her desire is to get to
[25:48] church so we're just gonna pray that all
[25:50] that'll go away
[25:51] and she asks also for the healing of her
[25:53] mind because of anxiety when you have to
[25:56] sit around and your world's turned
[25:58] upside down you get anxious you get all
[26:01] you know light chest and you've got all
[26:03] the butterflies and all that stuff a lot
[26:04] of anxiety
[26:06] comes with that when your world gets
[26:07] turned upside down or wreck or accident
[26:09] or whatever else so let's just pray
[26:11] for her now and pray for the rest of the
[26:13] service let's bow our heads dear lord
[26:15] thank you for this day
[26:16] we pray now that
[26:18] number one you come here
[26:20] and speak to us today lord
[26:23] you be the speaker lord you be the one
[26:25] that gives revelation
[26:27] and lord as the word goes forth i pray
[26:28] that if anyone's sick in the building we
[26:30] know the sister mary commandees had a
[26:32] special request lord and we pray now
[26:33] that you'd send the holy spirit there
[26:35] with the healing power that we know it
[26:37] has inside of
[26:38] all of us that we send that to her lord
[26:41] that she'll be raised up for your honor
[26:42] and glory and the hip will stop hurting
[26:44] and the cold will go away and and her
[26:46] desire is to come to church lord and i
[26:48] pray that you just grant her that desire
[26:50] lord to keep her out of that anxiety
[26:53] it's just the devil you do not make
[26:54] people anxious
[26:56] it's the devil that makes people that
[26:57] way

[27:36] that
[27:37] john 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the
[27:39] word where it was with god and the word
[27:40] was god in verse 14 and the word was

[28:03] mother's day card from the church you
[28:05] need to let brother terrence know or
[28:07] sister lisa know
[28:09] because that was a gift to you mothers
[28:11] and some of you i know weren't here
[28:13] but we want to make sure everybody gets
[28:15] a little gift from the church and make
[28:16] sure you thank brother and sister dale
[28:18] for providing that
[28:20] gift on mother's day amen
[28:27] a little thank you goes a long way you
[28:28] know brother brown and that guy was that
[28:30] brother branham was going one day he
[28:32] said that
[28:33] he said that guy just walked up to me
[28:35] and you could hear it in brother brown's
[28:37] voice he said he said that man walked up
[28:38] to me and said i don't need anybody to
[28:39] tell me thank you i don't need anybody
[28:41] to tell me a good sermon i don't need
[28:42] this he said brother brother brown said
[28:44] that man was lying
[28:46] every human being likes a good pat on
[28:48] the back every once in a while
[28:49] or a good sermon or attaboy or thank you
[28:52] for doing what you're doing and thank
[28:53] you for all this
[28:54] um that uh that you're doing for the
[28:57] people that you really didn't have to do
[28:59] but you did it out of the goodness of
[29:00] your heart so we need to make sure we're
[29:02] appreciative and give it back and thank
[29:05] thank brother and sister dale for doing
[29:06] that so
[29:07] so let's now romans 10 verse 8 says but
[29:10] what saith it the word is nigh thee even
[29:12] in thy mouth and in the heart the word
[29:14] of faith which we preach
[29:16] that if you confess shall confess
[29:18] without mouth to lord jesus and believe
[29:19] on thine heart that god hath raised him
[29:21] from the dead thou shalt be saved
[29:24] all right we're talking talk about just
[29:26] baby form salvation they're going to
[29:28] pull up the chart in just a second i
[29:30] think over on this side
[29:33] but i have i have
[29:35] this week i've kind of tried to
[29:37] pull it back a little bit so that we can
[29:39] all understand
[29:41] i don't want to run away from anybody
[29:42] but we got to understand we got to be
[29:44] born again we got to understand how and
[29:46] why and what's the
[29:48] uh what's the way how's the way there's
[29:50] been many ways brother brown told us
[29:52] 50 50-something years ago 60 years ago
[29:54] he said the new birth is the most
[29:56] ill-taught subject in christendom
[29:58] because one says it's this one says it's
[30:00] this one said i cried one said i shouted
[30:02] i quit chewing tobacco i quit doing this
[30:03] i quit drinking i quit
[30:05] that's not the new birth
[30:08] all right that's not the new birth
[30:10] amen the new birth is god personally
[30:12] coming to you and we'll talk about in
[30:14] just a minute and burning out
[30:17] not just softly
[30:20] oh he's going to come in is this soft no
[30:23] the kingdom of god is taken by force
[30:26] he's going to rip that thing out of you
[30:28] he's going to pull that thing out of you
[30:30] and he's going to kill it that old
[30:32] nature i'm talking about not your soul
[30:35] the nature that's attached to it because
[30:36] if it kills your soul you're dead and if
[30:39] god kills your soul you're in trouble
[30:41] all right that's gog that's way a long
[30:43] time from here because the only one that
[30:44] can kill a soul is the one that gave you
[30:46] soul
[30:47] man satan can't kill your soul
[30:49] he can pervert your soul enough though
[30:50] where god has to kill it
[30:54] amen righteous judge he can't stand
[30:57] evil
[30:59] thou shalt be saved for with the heart
[31:00] look for with the heart man believeth
[31:02] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[31:04] confession is made
[31:06] unto salvation as we were talking last
[31:08] week
[31:09] and last
[31:10] saturday at the bible study
[31:14] if you'll compartmentalize all these
[31:16] things you'll understand it a lot better
[31:18] because once you get born again
[31:22] see where that bracket says son of god
[31:24] can you you don't see it from over there
[31:26] sorry
[31:27] we're going to leave it over there
[31:28] because i need to have this one over
[31:29] here
[31:30] technology but see where the bracket
[31:33] says son of god son of god and we'll
[31:35] read it in just a few minutes that was
[31:36] what god the new birth in the church
[31:39] ages
[31:40] everybody with me
[31:41] and that that group got the message of
[31:44] their time their little box they lived
[31:48] that message they lived that
[31:51] time period they lived the word of god
[31:53] for their day and they died and they
[31:55] were put in the sixth dimension because
[31:57] the son of god is what the holy ghost
[32:00] the baptism of the holy ghost but what
[32:02] is the son of man it's that holy ghost
[32:04] inside of a human being
[32:06] all right the son of man
[32:08] now don't get me wrong but the son of
[32:10] man has nothing to do with your new
[32:12] birth
[32:16] it does but it does you understand what
[32:18] i mean
[32:19] the understanding of the son of god puts
[32:22] you in the body of christ you come up in
[32:23] the first resurrection you don't have to
[32:25] stand the judgment you don't have to go
[32:26] through the tribulation period you get
[32:28] to live in the city your bride
[32:30] amen
[32:32] but those people have gone on and we'll
[32:34] read it in just a few minutes oh we'll
[32:35] read this afternoon if we get to it
[32:38] but that son of man at the top that
[32:40] that's something that's never been
[32:42] taught before that was jesus himself
[32:46] he was the son of man everybody with me
[32:48] all right so look
[32:50] christian
[32:51] walk of god is right here
[32:54] not down here
[32:56] you're still walking in flesh and
[32:57] walking in sin until you get born again
[33:00] then you come to the revelation not
[33:02] revelation of the son of god but it is a
[33:05] revelation that you're born again that
[33:07] god has given you the new birth and
[33:09] these virtues are going to now flow out
[33:12] of you if you'll let them
[33:14] but this is a special
[33:16] the headstone that's been what i've put
[33:19] special anointing over there that
[33:20] headstone was rejected so in other words
[33:22] it just disappeared
[33:26] in the church ages it was not taught
[33:28] it wasn't supposed to be taught in the
[33:30] church ages the prophet tells us that in
[33:32] the end time the bible tells us that the
[33:34] son of man is to come back in the end
[33:36] time just like he did when he walked the
[33:38] shores of galilee
[33:40] in a mini-membered body and that will be
[33:42] for a body change not for salvation
[33:46] not to make it in the rapture i've never
[33:49] taught that never will teach that
[33:52] you born again as look see that little
[33:54] baby shadow right there
[33:56] if you're born again today that's you
[33:58] today
[33:59] if you just started and that baby
[34:02] is going to make it in a rapture
[34:05] the first resurrection
[34:06] with all the other bride but you've got
[34:08] to have look
[34:10] you've got to have somebody to come to
[34:12] the wheat
[34:13] maturity
[34:15] to bring these people out of the ground
[34:17] to bring these people up they listen
[34:20] they without us cannot be made perfect
[34:26] so what's paul tell us he says therefore
[34:27] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[34:29] of christ i'm going to read that real
[34:30] quick and then we'll skip through it
[34:32] leaving the principles of doctrine of
[34:34] christ let us go on to perfection
[34:36] everybody with me
[34:38] this is the epitome of perfection this
[34:39] is your body change this is only see how
[34:42] little it is
[34:44] only a small group of people is going to
[34:45] attain to that
[34:48] small group of people
[34:50] but it's but we have the ability to do
[34:52] it
[34:53] by the opening of the field by the
[34:55] opening of the word of god in the end
[34:56] time god has told us there will be a
[34:59] group of people
[35:00] that will stand and death will not be
[35:02] able to harm them
[35:05] that's what we're looking at
[35:07] therefore leaving the principles of the
[35:08] doctrine of christ
[35:10] let us go on into perfection we were
[35:11] talking about this the other day not
[35:13] laying again the foundation
[35:15] of repentance
[35:16] we'll talk about that a little bit
[35:18] because you can't keep coming back to
[35:20] the foundation
[35:21] what if you walked out and built a house
[35:23] today but you you were going to build
[35:24] this great big house to live in and you
[35:26] built a foundation
[35:29] and you started setting up furniture
[35:34] what are you saying for
[35:36] that's what a lot of people do they get
[35:38] in the foundation and say well i live
[35:39] right here i'll start putting my and
[35:41] then the first time what first time the
[35:42] wind blows it's going to blow whatever
[35:44] you got
[35:45] sitting on that foundation but that
[35:47] foundation is for you to what build
[35:49] walls
[35:51] build a roof
[35:52] then put your furniture in
[35:54] build a wall a living moving breathing
[35:57] instrumentality of god the prophet of
[35:59] god said build the house
[36:02] you're starting down here but build the
[36:04] house
[36:05] give something for this to reside in
[36:08] because if not you're going to be tossed
[36:10] yes
[36:11] by every wind of doctrine
[36:14] as the bible tells us
[36:16] of the doctrine of baptism and laying on
[36:18] of hands under the resurrection of the
[36:19] dead of eternal judgment
[36:21] and this will we do if god permit
[36:24] first corinthians 13 9 says for we know
[36:26] in part we prophesy in part but that
[36:28] which is perfect
[36:33] son of man was perfect was he not
[36:36] i know some of them came to certain
[36:38] parts of perfection but the son of man
[36:39] was perfect
[36:41] and then if that son of man is supposed
[36:42] to come back in the end time and come
[36:44] inside of me and you in its fullness it
[36:46] makes us
[36:47] perfect thank you very much
[36:49] then that which is part shall be done
[36:51] away with not done away you can't look
[36:53] you can't say all right i built a house
[36:54] let's rip the foundation out from under
[36:56] it what's going to happen brother john
[36:58] house going to fall
[37:00] house is going to fall no matter how
[37:02] good you built all this up here if you
[37:04] leave that foundation it'll be fine but
[37:07] if you want to take that foundation out
[37:08] from under the house
[37:10] when i was a child i spoke to the child
[37:12] brother bob was preaching my sermon
[37:14] today
[37:17] it's all right
[37:19] they get you in the mindset maybe get
[37:21] you in the same furrow
[37:23] i understood as a child i thought as a
[37:25] child
[37:26] it's not bad to be a child
[37:28] it's actually really good to be a child
[37:31] look at all the things we do for
[37:33] a baby starts crying what's the first
[37:35] thing we do almost the whole church goes
[37:37] looking what what what do they need
[37:40] but now if josh starts crying back there
[37:42] unless the lord attacks him pretty good
[37:43] if he just starts crying and say i need
[37:45] my mama
[37:47] we're gonna pay me attention
[37:49] half the church gonna turn around and
[37:50] say what grow up
[37:53] stop crying back there
[37:55] but i put away childish things in other
[37:57] words i put the xbox up
[38:00] now listen if you like to play xbox and
[38:01] you're 50 years old that's okay but it's
[38:03] a waste of time
[38:08] i didn't get any mans from those that
[38:09] still have xboxes
[38:11] but
[38:13] you don't need a lot of discernment when
[38:14] people are going
[38:18] but what does that mean it means brought
[38:20] to an end or finished
[38:22] that's what i like this is why we have
[38:24] to come to perfection because it will
[38:26] end
[38:27] in
[38:29] the dispensation
[38:31] of just being born again
[38:33] and living for god because see the son
[38:35] of god revelation is these virtues
[38:38] the revelation of the son of god we'll
[38:39] get into it this afternoon brother brown
[38:41] said these virtues without the holy
[38:43] ghost is a stumbling block to the
[38:44] believer why because you got to start at
[38:47] the foundation
[38:48] you got to start down here and that's
[38:49] what we're going to start on we had a
[38:51] little bit the other night but we'll
[38:52] kind of
[38:53] go on a little bit more today if that's
[38:55] all right
[38:56] brought to an end finished
[38:59] wanting nothing necessary to
[39:01] completeness
[39:03] perfect
[39:04] that which is perfect
[39:06] consummate human integrity
[39:08] and virtue
[39:10] full grown adult a full age a finisher a
[39:13] perfecter
[39:15] one who has in his own person raised
[39:16] faith to its perfection and so set
[39:19] before us the highest example
[39:21] of faith
[39:23] faith is the substance of things hoped
[39:24] for the evidence of things not seen
[39:26] that's down here at faith but that faith
[39:29] never listened that if that's it faced
[39:31] the foundation it never leaves you
[39:35] it's going to take more faith though to
[39:37] be here than it is here
[39:39] it's going to take a lot more faith to
[39:41] be here than is here and faith is the
[39:43] substance of things hoped for we're
[39:44] hoping for a body change but it's an
[39:47] evidence that there's going to be one
[39:48] amen
[39:50] because that faith is there
[39:52] it's the fish in the water which one was
[39:54] first the water was there so the fish
[39:56] can get in it
[39:58] look at the days of creation
[40:00] ephesians 4 11 said he gave some
[40:01] apostles how are we going to get this
[40:03] brother away
[40:04] well he'd give it he give us
[40:06] he give us these people
[40:09] a prophets apostles prophets pastors
[40:12] teachers and evangelists for the
[40:13] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[40:15] the ministry for the edifying of the
[40:16] body of christ is everybody okay i'm not
[40:18] getting you drunk by reading that am i
[40:21] it makes me where i can get through it a
[40:22] little bit faster till we all come to
[40:23] the unity of faith all come to the what
[40:25] unity not division
[40:28] not i can't stand this person and this
[40:29] person doesn't mean this
[40:31] no we got to talk about brother kindness
[40:32] a little bit later on
[40:34] it's easy to let people love you
[40:37] love somebody that literally hates your
[40:38] guts
[40:41] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[40:43] into a perfect man until see that's son
[40:45] of god
[40:47] son of god
[40:48] didn't say son of man
[40:52] because when you come to son of man
[40:53] revelation you've had a lot of
[40:56] teaching
[40:57] from pastors prophets teachers
[40:59] evangelists and all the different five
[41:00] folk ministries and to the measure of
[41:02] the stature of the fullness of christ
[41:03] that we henceforth be no more foundation
[41:06] babies
[41:08] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[41:10] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[41:12] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[41:14] lying wait
[41:16] to deceive so lit folks they're out
[41:17] there
[41:19] they're out there
[41:20] satan is out there to deceive satan is
[41:22] right here in your mind right now i'm
[41:24] trying to deceive you amen but speaking
[41:26] the truth in what love not filial love
[41:29] agape love
[41:30] love that doesn't have feeling and
[41:32] emotion to it oh
[41:35] wait a minute nope doesn't
[41:39] feel love has feeling and emotion and
[41:40] that's what we have to filter agapa love
[41:42] through
[41:43] because we're humans
[41:45] we can't have agape love without the new
[41:47] birth
[41:48] like brother brown said feel your love
[41:50] somebody strikes your wife you'll kill
[41:52] him
[41:53] agape love you'll pray for him
[41:56] big difference
[41:58] which is the head even christ may grow
[42:00] up into him in all things
[42:03] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[42:05] together and compacted
[42:08] every sunday and every wednesday listen
[42:09] to the tape boy sometimes it hurts it
[42:11] hurts to be compacted but you know what
[42:14] it keeps everything together
[42:17] and whichever joint supplies according
[42:19] to the effects you're working what's he
[42:20] talking about he's talking about a body
[42:22] he's talking about a body joints
[42:24] he's talking about every joint well if
[42:25] you didn't have a joint what would you
[42:27] be you couldn't be a statutor you'd be a
[42:30] statue
[42:32] if you had no joints
[42:34] some of them some people probably wish
[42:36] the joint that's up under my ears didn't
[42:39] work very well
[42:42] but boot devil god made me this way
[42:46] maketh the increase of the body into the
[42:47] edifying of itself
[42:49] in love
[42:50] and that's agape love not feeling love
[42:53] so that word there means adult age
[42:55] maturity suitable age for anything
[42:59] come on devil
[43:01] anything
[43:03] if you're mature enough you'll be able
[43:05] to handle it if you're not you're going
[43:08] to yield just like i'm going to talk
[43:09] about that nature today you're going to
[43:12] yield to the devil every time
[43:16] amen
[43:20] 100
[43:23] without the new birth
[43:24] you're going to yield to that old nature
[43:29] i don't know about y'all but is it just
[43:31] me maybe
[43:34] things i used to do i do them no more
[43:37] but it's not that i don't think about
[43:38] them amen
[43:41] let's be real
[43:43] we're not message zombies
[43:46] suitable aids for anything
[43:47] metaphorically of an attained state fit
[43:49] for a thing something that's what this
[43:52] is talking about me and you today it's
[43:53] not talking about the world it's fit for
[43:55] this thing called the bride
[43:58] the perfection is going to come no one
[44:00] else is going to come to perfection
[44:03] except the bride of jesus christ
[44:05] only the bride of jesus christ is going
[44:07] to come to perfection
[44:10] first corinthians 14 19 says yet in the
[44:12] church i'd rather speak five words
[44:14] here's paul
[44:15] five words with my understanding
[44:18] that by my voice i might teach others
[44:20] now not just to speak them that's right
[44:23] i got a quote on my region this
[44:24] afternoon where brother brown talks
[44:26] about remember the first sermon he
[44:27] preached
[44:29] what he said
[44:31] man he said i preached the sermon he
[44:32] said brother dr david said brother brown
[44:34] that's the worst sermon i ever heard he
[44:36] said yeah but everybody in the church
[44:38] was crying he said they cried funerals
[44:40] they cried burst
[44:41] he said you didn't say anything about
[44:42] the word of god
[44:44] and i think that's the way we got it now
[44:46] if you're crying if you weep a little
[44:47] bit it's okay but
[44:49] what are you saying
[44:51] bring the word of god let me shout about
[44:53] what you're going to say the preacher
[44:55] don't have to shout about you shout
[44:56] about what i'm saying
[44:58] if it's the word of god if it's not then
[45:00] sleep on
[45:03] that by my voice i might teach others
[45:05] also than 10 000 words in an unknown
[45:08] tongue
[45:09] brethren be not children in
[45:11] understanding you know why he said that
[45:13] because the previous verse
[45:15] people children without understanding
[45:17] are going to head toward this emotional
[45:19] side every time
[45:23] oh he made me cry
[45:25] oh he made me shout
[45:28] no he didn't make you do it
[45:30] you did it because that's all you need
[45:32] to do
[45:33] what does a baby do
[45:35] a baby cries because that's all it knows
[45:36] to do
[45:38] but now as an adult
[45:42] you have emotions to cry laugh
[45:44] not say anything take the word of god
[45:47] and grow up
[45:49] i be the mouths be children but in
[45:51] understanding be men
[45:52] that's what we all need to come to
[45:54] understanding
[45:55] not the understanding of man the
[45:56] understanding of god to not be children
[45:59] anymore
[46:00] in the law it is written with men and
[46:02] other tongues and other lips will i
[46:03] speak unto the people and yet for all
[46:04] that
[46:05] they will not hear me saith the lord
[46:08] wherefore tongues are for a sign not to
[46:10] them that believe
[46:11] but to them that believe not
[46:14] but prophesying service not for them
[46:17] that believe not but for them
[46:20] which believe in other words the
[46:21] preaching of the word of god
[46:24] is god telling you what he's already
[46:26] said about you so he's prophesying of a
[46:30] group of people
[46:31] and to a group of people first
[46:33] corinthians two verse nine says but it
[46:35] is written eye has not seen nor ear
[46:36] heard neither have entered into the
[46:38] heart of man the things which god hath
[46:40] prepared for them that have agape love
[46:44] amen amen
[46:48] may i say that
[46:50] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[46:52] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[46:54] things yea the deep things of god if you
[46:56] have the baptism of the holy ghost today
[46:58] there is something that draws you higher
[47:00] if it's not you're not born again you
[47:02] just got a feeling you just got an
[47:03] emotion i'll come to church when i can
[47:08] no no we're way past that see we don't
[47:12] have to sit here and judge people people
[47:14] that just show up every once in a while
[47:15] and don't come back second service don't
[47:17] show up on wednesday night you ain't
[47:19] born again
[47:22] you ain't born again
[47:24] get born again
[47:26] cause they some born again people come
[47:28] to church every sunday
[47:29] every wednesday that's when the board
[47:31] again people come to church the ones
[47:32] that are not born again come to church
[47:33] when they want to
[47:36] if it hits you right between eyes you
[47:38] need a new birth and that's all you just
[47:39] said it's just simple as that why are
[47:41] you talking about me ain't talking about
[47:42] you talking about the devil's inside of
[47:43] you getting you to do that stuff
[47:45] because it searches all things yea the
[47:48] deep things of god for what man knoweth
[47:50] the things of a man say the spirit
[47:52] that's in him that's what i was just
[47:53] saying
[47:54] we can tell the spirit that's in people
[47:56] by the things that they do and the way
[47:58] that they act sure we have all our
[48:00] little intricacies that that i may not
[48:02] like you know
[48:04] music and but i like hunting that ain't
[48:05] got nothing to do with the word of god
[48:08] that's humanity
[48:10] but when it comes down to the word of
[48:11] god if you're doing these things you're
[48:14] not born again
[48:16] if you're doing these things it shows
[48:18] that at least you're trying to get born
[48:19] again if you're not already you're
[48:21] trying to get born again but just listen
[48:23] folks
[48:25] everybody in this building has been in
[48:26] the message at least two or three years
[48:29] i'm looking around just to make sure
[48:31] if you don't know
[48:33] for a fact
[48:34] that coming to church is a duty of a
[48:37] christian you are deceived
[48:40] you need to get born again
[48:43] well i got this
[48:46] bro tom falbush he used to come and i'm
[48:49] gonna tell it that okay donny
[48:51] brother tom falbush had a problem
[48:53] with going to the restroom
[48:55] number one
[48:57] he wore a catheter and made his own bag
[49:00] and tied it to his leg
[49:02] he was here every single service
[49:06] and you can't make it because your cat
[49:07] gets cross-eyed every once in a while
[49:10] come on come on people
[49:12] it's time to grow up
[49:14] if you don't come to church you ain't
[49:16] born again
[49:17] if you don't have a desire if it doesn't
[49:19] say hey i've got to go not that i i want
[49:22] to do this this is something in my heart
[49:24] well i've got you can get all kind of
[49:26] excuses
[49:28] that wasn't in my notes but you get you
[49:29] got it anyway
[49:31] because what man knoweth the things of a
[49:33] man save the spirit of the man which in
[49:35] him you know what take a guy that's in
[49:37] the world he's got a spirit in him
[49:39] you you stay around him long enough
[49:41] you'll find out what that spirit is
[49:44] same way with a christian
[49:46] supposed to be
[49:47] because look even so the things of god
[49:50] knoweth no man but the spirit of god
[49:53] because without the holy ghost
[49:55] you can't understand god
[49:59] you just come into church because
[50:00] somebody told you to
[50:02] now we have received not the spirit of
[50:04] the world but the spirit which is of god
[50:07] so there's a spirit that we have that we
[50:09] didn't have before
[50:11] everybody with me
[50:13] we're going to try to get into it if we
[50:14] don't we'll get to it this afternoon
[50:16] but we talk about that stony heart and
[50:18] brother brown talks about god giving you
[50:19] a new spirit
[50:21] it's not the holy spirit
[50:24] everybody with me
[50:25] but he does give you a new spirit
[50:28] to start coming see that's what
[50:31] i'm back at one more time
[50:33] in sanctification you should want to
[50:35] come to church all the time
[50:37] just in sanctification because the
[50:39] unclean spirit goes out you want to come
[50:41] to church
[50:43] not the new well i come to church now
[50:45] every sunday because of the new birth no
[50:46] you don't
[50:49] you might know why
[50:52] but you should come to church and
[50:53] sanctification because brother brown
[50:55] says your name goes on the
[50:57] book is a believer you become religious
[50:59] right
[51:00] but it's a hard one to stay at though
[51:02] because
[51:02] satan will make you deceived and set you
[51:04] in a church and tell you that
[51:05] everything's okay and you're all right
[51:07] and you ain't got to understand what the
[51:08] preacher says that's hogwash i just told
[51:10] you what it said right here the spirit
[51:12] is what if you have the holy ghost and
[51:15] it's down there at the bottom it's it
[51:17] don't want to stay a baby
[51:19] so who makes it stay a baby
[51:23] we do
[51:25] now we have received not the spirit of
[51:27] the world but the spirit which is of god
[51:30] that we might know the things that are
[51:31] freely given to us of god
[51:34] which stings look
[51:37] which things also we speak not in the
[51:39] words which man's wisdom teaches but
[51:42] which the holy ghost teaches comparing
[51:43] spiritual things with spiritual
[51:47] but the nature of man receiveth not the
[51:49] things of the spirit of god we'll talk
[51:51] about that in just a few minutes
[51:52] the nature the natural man
[51:55] you were born with an adamic nature you
[51:57] were born with a nature
[51:59] sinful
[52:01] you can't help it because you were born
[52:03] in sin
[52:05] that's why you were put on free moral
[52:07] agency and god gave you a choice to make
[52:09] that's right
[52:10] we'll talk about the age of
[52:11] accountability maybe in just a few
[52:12] minutes
[52:13] but the natural man receiveth not the
[52:15] things of the spirit of god
[52:17] for their foolishness to him
[52:21] i tell some of you now
[52:22] oh i really don't have to come to church
[52:24] i'm in the message i can watch online
[52:30] the bible says for satan that's
[52:32] assembling
[52:33] of yourself together
[52:36] i know there's some cane i know there's
[52:37] some that live a long way and i know
[52:39] some that are older and that's fine but
[52:41] if you're healthy
[52:44] i'm going to use the tom fall bush if
[52:45] you've got a catheter wrapped around
[52:46] your leg and you
[52:47] you want to be in church you'll be in
[52:49] church god will make a way for you to do
[52:50] that
[52:51] because i know that probably 90 percent
[52:52] of this the people sitting here today
[52:54] did not know brother tom had that
[52:57] every service he was here every service
[52:59] even on wednesday night
[53:02] he had to go back there and empty that
[53:04] bag
[53:05] but he came to church
[53:06] and you know what he's in glory right
[53:07] now
[53:09] because he did what god asked him to do
[53:12] you come to church you do what you're
[53:14] supposed to do
[53:16] and i'll make you a child of god
[53:19] because if we don't have the spirit of
[53:21] god in us
[53:22] we're what it's foolishness to us
[53:24] when i was out in the world when you
[53:25] were out in the world it was foolish to
[53:26] want to come to church
[53:32] don't get quiet on me
[53:34] neither can he know them
[53:37] because they are spiritually
[53:39] discerned
[53:41] listen when you get the baptism of the
[53:42] holy ghost you become a spiritual person
[53:46] in god
[53:48] now you're a spiritual person now
[53:50] but you get the new birth it moves you
[53:53] over to new desires
[53:59] but remember we're predestinated not
[54:01] just to get born again
[54:03] we're predestinated to grow to adoption
[54:06] we're predestinated and we are being
[54:08] pulled up that pyramid
[54:10] by the holy ghost it's up there on the
[54:12] very top right there that's what you get
[54:14] the new birth here you get the new birth
[54:16] here it cannot do anything but pull you
[54:19] up
[54:20] so if you're not being pulled to grow
[54:22] you don't have the new birth down here
[54:26] amen
[54:28] i wish we'd look at ourselves in the
[54:30] face every once in a while
[54:34] say am i really doing right
[54:36] am i really born again or am i just
[54:38] sitting in the church and
[54:40] oh there's some good preachers in this
[54:42] church ain't no doubt
[54:44] but you can sit here and go to hell with
[54:46] five good preachers in this church
[54:52] so the son of man ministry just to get
[54:54] before we get started on the stages of
[54:55] adoption
[54:59] because remember you can't be adopted
[55:00] without being a son
[55:02] so we're going to get to this and we're
[55:03] going back way up right to the birth
[55:07] but when we look at this
[55:09] chart and i don't i
[55:11] i thought that i simplified it but maybe
[55:13] i didn't but
[55:15] but
[55:16] the new birth gets you in the body
[55:18] then the verse you start working through
[55:20] you
[55:21] and then the holy spirit seals it in
[55:23] because you're what you've come to
[55:25] adoption
[55:27] all right then the son of man ministry
[55:30] comes on the scene and caps that off in
[55:32] other words sits down on top of that and
[55:35] you're fully connected
[55:37] that's for your body change not for your
[55:39] new birth
[55:40] the son of god is the new birth
[55:42] everybody with me
[55:45] all right now we're looking at the chart
[55:46] and remember adoption is not your birth
[55:48] so
[55:49] it's not
[55:52] we got to pull this apart now put the
[55:54] next one up please brother
[55:57] the one that we've been dealing with and
[55:58] i wanted
[56:01] that
[56:03] in its fullness
[56:05] makes you a christian amen
[56:07] a son and daughter of god
[56:09] right there
[56:10] that's what makes you a christian
[56:13] everybody with me
[56:14] all right not not that i i
[56:17] no
[56:18] everything is in that though the life of
[56:20] that plant that you plant in the ground
[56:24] remember you plant it
[56:26] it get roots
[56:28] it's got to be established and then what
[56:30] does it do you go out there and say man
[56:32] i got
[56:33] corn up now this tall i think i'll just
[56:35] cut it off
[56:38] well it's corn
[56:40] well potentially it's corn
[56:42] it has the ability
[56:44] to put ears on the stalk but it's got to
[56:47] go through
[56:48] one stage
[56:50] two stages
[56:52] three stages
[56:53] and then that's got to lay in the
[56:55] sun
[56:56] to ripen all the virtues is everybody
[56:59] with me
[57:00] all right
[57:01] that's pretty good
[57:03] so we know that there's three stages of
[57:04] adoption and it has to start with your
[57:06] birth
[57:07] romans 8 verse 14 says minions are led
[57:09] by the spirit of god
[57:10] they are the sons of god everybody
[57:13] writing me doing this and this was
[57:14] worked out pretty good
[57:16] but you have not received the spirit of
[57:17] bondage to forget to fear listen you're
[57:20] in bondage until you're born again no
[57:22] i'm free i can do all i want to do i can
[57:24] do everything you're bound
[57:29] you're bound
[57:31] because when you do get born again
[57:33] you look back and say
[57:35] that wasn't freedom
[57:38] i was bound
[57:44] i was bound but now i'm free
[57:47] for you have not received the spirit of
[57:49] a mind of bondage again to fear but you
[57:51] have received the spirit of adoption
[57:53] what a new nature
[57:55] a new spirit that's motivating you to do
[57:58] the things of god
[58:00] not the things of the devil
[58:02] right
[58:06] we'll get to that in just a second but
[58:08] you have received the spirit of adoption
[58:10] whereby you cry
[58:12] abba father our father father the spirit
[58:15] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[58:17] so you have a spirit
[58:19] amen
[58:20] the holy spirit bears witness
[58:23] that we are the children of god all
[58:25] right children of god
[58:27] look children of god and if children
[58:29] then heirs heirs of what all that that
[58:32] was up there when the first one
[58:34] all that up through there
[58:36] every promise in the book is mine
[58:39] every chapter every verse how are you
[58:40] going to know that though if you're not
[58:42] born again
[58:44] some of you heard me up at brother jules
[58:46] you got to have the
[58:48] as brother brown said you got to have
[58:49] the heart of the composer
[58:51] before you can read the sheet music
[58:54] you got to have
[58:56] some some kind of ability
[58:59] i mean i look at these notes
[59:03] and and they mean absolutely nothing to
[59:05] me
[59:09] a flat b flat b
[59:11] i know there's a seed whatever
[59:15] you start with the letter c right c is
[59:17] the middle key i knew that
[59:19] but other than that
[59:22] i don't understand because what there's
[59:23] not a spirit in me to play an instrument
[59:26] but if there's a spirit inside of me to
[59:28] play an instrument
[59:29] i'd know what that says
[59:31] so guess what when you read the word of
[59:32] god and you're not a christian
[59:34] it doesn't mean
[59:36] as much to you as if you're born again
[59:39] and read the word of god
[59:43] but look it's okay to be a child
[59:47] that's where you got to start
[59:49] and if children then heirs
[59:51] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[59:54] where was where was i loved the picture
[59:56] of brother branham
[59:57] i mean a picture of the bride they got
[59:59] one with the bride up here but they got
[1:00:01] one with jesus standing here with the
[1:00:02] hoffman's head at the top because that
[1:00:04] is who that is
[1:00:06] that's who we got to emulate no we got
[1:00:09] to be that
[1:00:12] but now it's not going to be real fun
[1:00:16] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:00:18] that we may be also glorified
[1:00:21] together
[1:00:23] you got to have a nature change because
[1:00:24] if you don't have a nature change i said
[1:00:26] before you're always going to go back
[1:00:27] the other way
[1:00:30] without a nature change you're going to
[1:00:31] always go back the other way
[1:00:33] always going the other direction all
[1:00:35] right why because you were born contrary
[1:00:37] to god
[1:00:38] so if you're born contrary to god it's
[1:00:40] like brother i'm talking about the the
[1:00:41] shooting of the of the gun how you can't
[1:00:44] ever get that bullet trajectory back
[1:00:46] right until you come all the way back
[1:00:49] and start at the foundation
[1:00:51] start at the
[1:00:52] blade in the front the two blades in the
[1:00:54] front and one blade in the back and when
[1:00:56] you line them up then you can shoot that
[1:00:58] bullet and it'll go right to the target
[1:01:00] but if you're off an inch here you'll be
[1:01:02] off
[1:01:03] 50 inches
[1:01:05] 200 yards away because it just
[1:01:06] continually going away
[1:01:09] that's why i'm telling you
[1:01:10] stay in church you say why do i have to
[1:01:13] go
[1:01:14] how many people have been successful not
[1:01:16] going to church
[1:01:19] they ain't a christian in the world
[1:01:22] that'll tell you it's better to stay at
[1:01:23] home than it is go to church if he's a
[1:01:26] real born-again christian you really
[1:01:27] have to never ask that question
[1:01:30] it's the weak ones you have to ask that
[1:01:32] question to i'm sorry we all some we
[1:01:33] have weaknesses we all do
[1:01:35] but we ought to be over this coming to
[1:01:37] church business
[1:01:39] you get born again you'll come to church
[1:01:44] well i'll make it when i can
[1:01:45] i need the spirit of god
[1:01:49] and the worst thing in the world is when
[1:01:51] you start getting in trouble what's the
[1:01:52] first thing that you do
[1:01:54] you disappear from church
[1:01:56] that's foolish
[1:01:58] that's absolutely the most foolish thing
[1:01:59] you can do
[1:02:01] is if you start having problems in
[1:02:02] yourself
[1:02:04] what does satan want to do divide and
[1:02:06] conquer he wants to keep you away from
[1:02:08] it
[1:02:09] because you just might get the holy
[1:02:10] ghost if you hang around holding those
[1:02:12] filled people
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:15] hey listen you hang around drunks out
[1:02:16] when you're in the bar what's the first
[1:02:17] thing you did you got drunk
[1:02:22] because the environment you were in made
[1:02:24] you act that way
[1:02:26] so let's come to church and get drunk on
[1:02:28] the holy ghost
[1:02:30] let it change your life every once in a
[1:02:31] while
[1:02:33] so now let's look at justification let's
[1:02:35] start with this bottom one down here
[1:02:37] but what sayeth that the word is nightly
[1:02:39] even in thy mouth and in the heart that
[1:02:41] is the word of faith
[1:02:43] which we preach
[1:02:44] saith thou shalt confess with our mouth
[1:02:46] the lord jesus and shall believe in thy
[1:02:48] heart that god hath raised him from the
[1:02:50] dead thou shalt be saved there's
[1:02:52] millions and billions of people
[1:02:54] that have come to that place
[1:02:58] but they stay there
[1:03:00] they stay there and brother brown says
[1:03:03] if you die right then you're going to go
[1:03:05] to heaven now he doesn't call you bride
[1:03:07] you will not be bright
[1:03:09] you will go to heaven though because
[1:03:11] your past sins has been chopped off
[1:03:12] you've done what the word said to do
[1:03:15] but now listen everybody in the sound of
[1:03:17] my voice that's still awake
[1:03:21] you don't have that option
[1:03:24] you've not been taught that way
[1:03:26] amen amen
[1:03:29] you do it you're not born again you're
[1:03:30] just doing a lot of ignorance and you're
[1:03:32] doing it because satan's
[1:03:33] getting you to do that
[1:03:36] for with the heart
[1:03:39] just talking to somebody the other day
[1:03:42] for with the heart that's where you
[1:03:44] believe
[1:03:46] you believe in your heart
[1:03:48] if your heart wants to do something
[1:03:53] and in justification
[1:03:56] let's simplify it right here
[1:03:59] i'll read it in just a minute
[1:04:01] it just chops off your past sins
[1:04:04] it gets you to a place to where you said
[1:04:06] i'm done it's like brother uh
[1:04:08] luis it's all about my i'm tired of this
[1:04:10] thinking thinking i'm tired of the place
[1:04:12] that i'm in
[1:04:13] you know who is that
[1:04:15] that's god
[1:04:17] because satan is never going to tell you
[1:04:18] you're not in the right place you need
[1:04:20] to be unless you're out in the world
[1:04:21] doing the things but i'm talking about
[1:04:22] coming into a religious environment or a
[1:04:24] christian environment if you feel
[1:04:26] uncomfortable then you need to get the
[1:04:27] new birth
[1:04:29] okay for when the heart man believeth
[1:04:31] unto righteousness and with a mouth
[1:04:33] confession is made unto salvation
[1:04:35] how's that romans 3 verse 24 says being
[1:04:38] justified freely by his grace we'll get
[1:04:40] into that a little bit later on going up
[1:04:42] the
[1:04:42] statue of a perfect man
[1:04:45] through the redemption that is in christ
[1:04:46] jesus watch whom god has set forth to be
[1:04:49] a what perpetuation
[1:04:51] through faith in his blood to declare
[1:04:53] his righteousness for the remission of
[1:04:55] sins that are past you cannot get
[1:04:58] forgiven i we heard a preacher one time
[1:05:01] praying to god to forgive his future
[1:05:03] sins
[1:05:04] can't do that
[1:05:05] that's catholicism
[1:05:09] i'm sorry and then the man turned out to
[1:05:11] turn the message down
[1:05:13] just saying
[1:05:14] but you can't get forgiven lord forgive
[1:05:16] me tomorrow i know i'm going to do it
[1:05:18] i'm not saying no i'm going to do it so
[1:05:20] forgive me no no get born again
[1:05:25] that's our theme get bored again
[1:05:27] but you get remission of sins that are
[1:05:29] past
[1:05:30] through the forbearance of god
[1:05:33] but it's from your heart
[1:05:36] to declare i say thee at this time his
[1:05:39] righteousness is not yours
[1:05:41] because you know what you can justify
[1:05:43] yourself and be wrong
[1:05:45] but god can't justify you and be wrong
[1:05:48] and you'd be wrong
[1:05:49] if god justifies you those who is
[1:05:51] justified he is already glorified he
[1:05:54] said to declare i say at this time his
[1:05:56] righteousness
[1:05:57] that he might be just and the justifier
[1:06:00] of him that believeth
[1:06:02] in jesus you've started in baby form
[1:06:04] justification
[1:06:05] you you know what you're not going to
[1:06:07] forget those sins but god did remember i
[1:06:08] talk about the sea of god's
[1:06:09] forgetfulness
[1:06:11] and don't go fishing
[1:06:12] there's a no fishing sign don't go
[1:06:14] fishing in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:06:16] uh-uh what do we do first thing we do we
[1:06:18] go
[1:06:19] well i'm doing this because
[1:06:24] now
[1:06:26] if you're truly justified
[1:06:28] you stand clean before god
[1:06:30] at this moment
[1:06:32] now remember though the unclean spirit
[1:06:34] has not left you
[1:06:35] you're going to continue as the prophet
[1:06:37] of god says you're going to continue to
[1:06:38] do if you were
[1:06:40] a thief you're still going to continue
[1:06:42] to steal
[1:06:43] that's a hard thing for people to see
[1:06:44] but in justification it all it does
[1:06:48] it chops off your past sins it gets you
[1:06:50] in a place to where god can soften you
[1:06:52] get ready to soften you up and start
[1:06:54] dealing with you
[1:06:55] all right
[1:06:56] where is boasting then
[1:06:58] it is it excluded so forget the boasting
[1:07:01] part
[1:07:02] well bless god he chopped off my past
[1:07:04] then so i'm just going to get another
[1:07:05] truckload of them
[1:07:08] god knows your heart
[1:07:10] and unless you really are repentant he
[1:07:12] ain't going to forgive those past sins
[1:07:15] because you really didn't mean it you're
[1:07:16] doing it with a motive
[1:07:18] that's off the word of god
[1:07:21] so the lord watch but the lot by the law
[1:07:23] of faith therefore we conclude
[1:07:25] paul
[1:07:26] we conclude this that a man is justified
[1:07:29] by faith without the deeds of the law
[1:07:33] do's and don'ts
[1:07:35] you can't get clean under the law
[1:07:39] once a year the priest took the blood
[1:07:42] sprinkled it went inside the holy of
[1:07:44] holies sprinkled it come back out says
[1:07:46] okay our sins are not done away with
[1:07:49] they're covered
[1:07:51] until next year we gotta do the same
[1:07:53] thing
[1:07:54] again and that's why paul says don't
[1:07:57] don't make the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:58] like that that you got to come in and
[1:07:59] out every every year you got to go in
[1:08:02] and out every year like i said before
[1:08:04] one more time get born again
[1:08:08] i won't take care of all your problems
[1:08:09] but i promise you it will help you deal
[1:08:11] with them
[1:08:15] justified freely
[1:08:20] first stage of justification chopped off
[1:08:23] your past sins unclean spirit's still
[1:08:25] there everybody with me
[1:08:27] we need to go through this because we
[1:08:28] got some young ones that are here
[1:08:30] now let's go to sanctification
[1:08:33] matthew 12 43 says when the unclean
[1:08:35] spirit has gone out of a man oh here we
[1:08:36] go we're fixing to change something here
[1:08:40] we're fixing to change an attitude
[1:08:42] because when the unclean spirit goes out
[1:08:44] of a man he walketh
[1:08:46] through dry places
[1:08:48] seeketh rest and findeth none
[1:08:53] then he sayeth who the devil the unclean
[1:08:55] spirit so that's not the holy spirit
[1:08:57] right everybody with me it's not always
[1:08:59] prayer it's unclean spirit
[1:09:01] when he goes out of a man he walks and
[1:09:03] drives places and when he look watch
[1:09:04] this then he says i will return into my
[1:09:06] house
[1:09:09] he's still got possession on you
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:16] brother brown said he was a squatter he
[1:09:18] doesn't own the title deed
[1:09:20] but he's a squatter
[1:09:24] there's a difference in possessing
[1:09:25] something and being a tie having a title
[1:09:27] deed
[1:09:28] you can possess a piece of property
[1:09:30] until that owner stands up
[1:09:32] walks in and says
[1:09:33] i own this thing get off my land
[1:09:37] a lot of that happens overseas they have
[1:09:38] a lot of places people will go to the
[1:09:40] united states
[1:09:41] and they'll have a piece of property and
[1:09:43] they'll come back about six months later
[1:09:44] and somebody's already built a shack on
[1:09:46] it
[1:09:47] well they possess whatever's there but
[1:09:49] they don't own the ground so that's what
[1:09:51] satan done through the fall in the
[1:09:53] garden he has possessed me and you
[1:09:57] he's a possessor all right
[1:10:00] then he says i will return into my house
[1:10:02] from whence i came out
[1:10:06] and when he is come he finds it empty
[1:10:08] swept
[1:10:09] and garnished
[1:10:11] this person we'll talk about in just a
[1:10:13] minute maybe if we get to it this person
[1:10:15] has decided to start
[1:10:17] doing things different
[1:10:19] things
[1:10:21] and let me give you an example of that
[1:10:24] when you come to sanctification
[1:10:27] that unclean spirit has gone out
[1:10:29] it's an unclean spirit
[1:10:31] so you start getting a little different
[1:10:33] attitude and i'm just telling you what
[1:10:34] happened to me
[1:10:35] the unclean spirit's still there out
[1:10:37] there
[1:10:38] all right you don't throw it out there
[1:10:40] it just
[1:10:41] god just takes it and
[1:10:43] you do what you come to church that's
[1:10:45] what i said before
[1:10:47] people in this message
[1:10:49] and in different denominations says oh
[1:10:51] you just believe the message you shout
[1:10:53] speak in tongues
[1:10:54] you've got to be in the message because
[1:10:55] you're sitting in a message church
[1:10:57] that's a lie of the devil
[1:11:00] live the devil
[1:11:02] what have you done in 10 15 20 years
[1:11:04] have you grown anyone no i i just i
[1:11:07] can't get
[1:11:09] i still cry a lot
[1:11:12] stunted growth
[1:11:14] come on people
[1:11:16] then go with him and take it with
[1:11:18] himself seven more spirits more wicked
[1:11:20] than himself more religious than himself
[1:11:22] and they enter in
[1:11:25] because there's not a cap being put on
[1:11:27] it
[1:11:28] there's not a seal been put on it
[1:11:31] so the water can get out or we'll get
[1:11:32] back in one of the two
[1:11:36] and they enter in and dwell there and
[1:11:37] the last state of that man is worse
[1:11:40] than the first even so shall it be
[1:11:43] also unto this wicked
[1:11:45] generation
[1:11:47] is it so
[1:11:49] i know i got the new birth because no
[1:11:51] if you fall under a real true
[1:11:55] a work of the holy ghost of
[1:11:57] sanctification that's when all that junk
[1:11:59] goes out
[1:12:01] that's when all that goes away
[1:12:03] but then what's going to happen if you
[1:12:04] don't have a tie post
[1:12:07] if you don't have a spiritual rudder yes
[1:12:09] what's gonna happen is your
[1:12:12] vessel
[1:12:14] that you thought you could control
[1:12:18] come on somebody
[1:12:19] that you thought you could control the
[1:12:21] first wind it blows
[1:12:25] where is it going to blow you right back
[1:12:27] at where you were before
[1:12:29] right back out there
[1:12:32] but with that rudder that you have it
[1:12:33] doesn't matter if the wind blows listen
[1:12:35] it might be sideways we come flying into
[1:12:38] uh me and dad went bear hunting and we
[1:12:39] was in this little crop duster wasn't
[1:12:40] very much about 12 people on the plane
[1:12:42] but they come flying into wherever we
[1:12:44] were in new brunswick canada and i
[1:12:46] couldn't see the runway because it was
[1:12:48] so little i could i was sitting on the
[1:12:49] first seat and i went no further from
[1:12:50] here to
[1:12:51] um sister zoe from the pilot no door
[1:12:54] there that's how little that plane was
[1:12:56] and i could look out the window with him
[1:12:58] and there they're flying the plane and
[1:12:59] the yokes are turned this way
[1:13:03] you know what i'm talking about the
[1:13:04] yolk's supposed to be this way when
[1:13:06] you're landing on a straight runway
[1:13:09] i look outside brother john i see pine
[1:13:12] trees
[1:13:13] and i happen to look this way where the
[1:13:15] engine was
[1:13:17] i see the runway
[1:13:19] i'm like i hope we're gonna make another
[1:13:21] pass
[1:13:23] but what was the crosswind was like 30
[1:13:25] miles an hour and they were running into
[1:13:27] that crosswind and just right before we
[1:13:30] hit the runway
[1:13:31] that yo was like right before we hit the
[1:13:32] runway he turned it and said it right
[1:13:34] now
[1:13:35] why because he had control
[1:13:37] he had a rudder
[1:13:39] so the winds can blow you every which
[1:13:41] way it wants to blow you but look they
[1:13:43] had their mind on that runway and when
[1:13:45] they hit that runway they were right on
[1:13:47] that white line
[1:13:48] why because they were skilled pilots
[1:13:50] they had grown up past the baby stage
[1:13:52] now what if a baby had been sitting in
[1:13:54] that seat
[1:13:56] we had to hit the pine trees
[1:13:58] but a skilled pilot was on board
[1:14:01] a skilled pilot will get you where
[1:14:03] you're going
[1:14:05] same thing with the word of god
[1:14:08] second timothy 2 19 says nevertheless
[1:14:10] the foundation of god standeth sure
[1:14:13] having this seal that the lord knoweth
[1:14:15] them that are his
[1:14:17] let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:14:19] christ depart from iniquity
[1:14:22] depart from doing what you used to do
[1:14:25] that's
[1:14:26] sanctification
[1:14:28] not the new birth
[1:14:30] don't dwell on that because like i said
[1:14:32] before you don't have a rudder
[1:14:34] you will go back to where you were
[1:14:36] before
[1:14:40] but in a great house there's not only
[1:14:41] vessels of gold silver wood and earth
[1:14:44] some to honor and some to dishonor
[1:14:46] if a man therefore what purge himself
[1:14:48] from these he be he shall be a vessel of
[1:14:50] honor sanctified and meet for the
[1:14:53] master's use what is sanctification
[1:14:56] cleaned
[1:14:58] and set aside
[1:15:00] for service not in service
[1:15:03] compound word greek word cleaned
[1:15:08] and set aside for service
[1:15:10] not put in service
[1:15:12] and meet for the master's use and
[1:15:14] prepared into every
[1:15:16] good work
[1:15:19] listen there's a lot you got to do
[1:15:22] in these two stages
[1:15:25] because it is a work of the holy ghost
[1:15:26] but you know what it's doing it's going
[1:15:28] against your nature let me just say this
[1:15:29] just a few minutes we may not get
[1:15:31] nowhere
[1:15:32] but it goes against your nature
[1:15:36] we're not forgiving people when we're
[1:15:38] not born again
[1:15:40] hello somebody
[1:15:42] we're not very forgiving people
[1:15:44] people in the world that's their problem
[1:15:45] now they can't forgive
[1:15:48] things that happen hundreds of thousands
[1:15:49] 200 500 years ago they cannot get it out
[1:15:51] of their head
[1:15:53] but if you're a christian
[1:15:55] go
[1:15:56] go
[1:15:56] don't even worry about those things paul
[1:15:58] said
[1:15:59] in other words throwing those things
[1:16:01] that are passed out of the way
[1:16:03] let's go on to perfection and let's just
[1:16:05] walk
[1:16:07] no he said run
[1:16:10] and finish the race let's run
[1:16:14] now listen
[1:16:18] now watch judas iscariot
[1:16:23] swallow
[1:16:24] was justified by faith
[1:16:29] and believed on the lord jesus christ
[1:16:32] and was baptized
[1:16:34] let me ask you a question
[1:16:36] yeah everybody believed brother brown
[1:16:37] was the prophet right
[1:16:39] we believe what well some of you do i
[1:16:40] don't know what the wrestling i'll do in
[1:16:41] this building
[1:16:43] there's another church right over the
[1:16:44] under
[1:16:46] the bible said jesus baptized the
[1:16:48] disciples his disciples all right
[1:16:50] saint john 17 17 says before he could
[1:16:53] send them out he said sanctify them
[1:16:55] so judas was what justified
[1:16:58] and sanctified amen
[1:17:03] sanctify them father through thy truth
[1:17:04] thy word is truth
[1:17:06] and he was the word even before the
[1:17:09] atonement was made
[1:17:10] in other words as a preview father of my
[1:17:12] shed blood i'm going to sanctify these
[1:17:15] he gave them power against unclean
[1:17:17] spirits this is how an anointed one can
[1:17:20] work in the end time
[1:17:22] he can be given power to preach the
[1:17:24] gospel pray for the sick raise the dead
[1:17:27] preach the gospel
[1:17:31] and just be sanctified
[1:17:34] so when one thing comes along satan
[1:17:35] comes along guess what he goes back that
[1:17:37] way because he can't go this way he's
[1:17:38] got to go out of the message you can't
[1:17:40] stand the message
[1:17:41] he give them power against unclean
[1:17:43] spirits and they went out and they cast
[1:17:45] out devils of that right and they healed
[1:17:47] the sick is that right and they came
[1:17:49] back sanctified
[1:17:51] which we would consider the new birth
[1:17:54] by old
[1:17:56] teaching right brother can preach like a
[1:17:59] lark i'm telling you i heard a sermon
[1:18:00] from a brother that preached the
[1:18:02] millennium better than i've heard
[1:18:03] anybody preach the millennium got a lot
[1:18:05] and still got notes from it
[1:18:08] mostly in my head
[1:18:11] and he was sleeping with a 14 year old
[1:18:12] girl
[1:18:15] preaching a message y'all pretty much
[1:18:16] know pretty much who he is
[1:18:19] while he was doing that all that
[1:18:21] preaching all that good preaching
[1:18:23] so that don't mean deadly squat
[1:18:26] watch the life
[1:18:28] but they came back sanctified rejoicing
[1:18:31] jumping shouting and praising god
[1:18:34] if that's true some of y'all are not
[1:18:36] even sanctified
[1:18:42] just saying
[1:18:44] is that right and they said even the
[1:18:46] devil
[1:18:47] is subject to us
[1:18:49] jesus said don't you rejoice because the
[1:18:51] devil is a subject to you
[1:18:53] but rejoice because your names are
[1:18:54] written in the book of heaven is that
[1:18:56] right
[1:18:57] and judah says carrot was with them one
[1:18:59] of them called out
[1:19:01] sanctified
[1:19:03] he went to church
[1:19:06] i don't think he ever missed a service
[1:19:12] that'll tell you something
[1:19:14] and his name written in the lamb's book
[1:19:16] of life but remember not the eternal
[1:19:18] section
[1:19:20] because your name can be removed
[1:19:22] everybody with me
[1:19:23] read matthew 10 and see if that's not
[1:19:25] right he called each one of them and
[1:19:27] judas and every one of them right down
[1:19:29] there he sent them out gave them power
[1:19:31] against unclean
[1:19:33] spirits
[1:19:34] so let's not put our i'm born again
[1:19:37] because
[1:19:39] anymore no you're sanctified
[1:19:42] and you know what you can be sanctified
[1:19:44] and be a real good person
[1:19:47] but somewhere like i said before there's
[1:19:49] a wind going to blow through your life
[1:19:51] and it's going to blow you right back to
[1:19:53] where you were
[1:19:55] i hope this is hitting home
[1:19:57] how's the thing this
[1:20:00] this is 1955 a hidden life in christ
[1:20:03] how the thing was refreshed in the
[1:20:05] presence notice another thing once in
[1:20:07] the presence of god
[1:20:08] you get quiet why
[1:20:11] you get quieted
[1:20:14] it's kind of contrary to some of these
[1:20:15] meetings we've been doing huh
[1:20:19] you're not tossed about by everything
[1:20:21] you know where you're standing
[1:20:24] i'd rather know where i'm standing like
[1:20:26] paul said five words
[1:20:28] five words of revelation truth then to
[1:20:31] have all the shouting you can ever have
[1:20:34] but there's a time when you need to be
[1:20:35] shouting at you what you got that is the
[1:20:37] truth
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] you know where you're standing there
[1:20:41] something happens
[1:20:44] you know that you're a real christian
[1:20:46] you know that you've been in contact
[1:20:48] with somebody that loves you
[1:20:50] you know that something happened down
[1:20:52] here
[1:20:54] and it's refreshing
[1:20:55] and not only that but you'll refresh
[1:20:58] others
[1:21:00] you seen people that was nice people but
[1:21:02] you couldn't hardly stand to be around
[1:21:04] them
[1:21:05] there's something about them they got a
[1:21:07] creative power around them that just
[1:21:08] seems to be different
[1:21:10] how i'd like to stop here now if if
[1:21:13] brother brown stopped
[1:21:14] you need to listen to this
[1:21:17] it's like jeet listen he's not jesus
[1:21:19] christ but when he says that it's kind
[1:21:20] of like jesus saying very rarely
[1:21:22] listen listen fix and tell you something
[1:21:25] how i'd like to stop here if i was
[1:21:27] possible if it was possible tell you
[1:21:28] something on that you're a little
[1:21:30] creator yourself
[1:21:32] now here he talks about we're talking
[1:21:33] about sanctification real quick right
[1:21:35] here and then we'll close
[1:21:36] we'll get to the rest this afternoon
[1:21:38] he said he'd give you a new spirit
[1:21:41] now that spirit isn't god's spirit
[1:21:44] that's your spirit
[1:21:49] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[1:21:51] i'll put my spirit
[1:21:53] in him
[1:21:55] but the thing god has to do
[1:21:57] now look in sanctification not here
[1:22:00] not here when he's not talking about the
[1:22:01] holy ghost
[1:22:03] he's talking about sanctification
[1:22:05] there's many things to be said about
[1:22:06] sanctification your name goes on the
[1:22:08] book is a believer you become religious
[1:22:10] you start coming to church you start
[1:22:11] reading your bible
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:17] things i used to do
[1:22:19] i do them no more
[1:22:23] like i was telling somebody the other
[1:22:24] day
[1:22:26] brother brown how can i quit
[1:22:29] being
[1:22:30] selfish
[1:22:32] he said just do the opposite
[1:22:36] just do the opposite no brother brother
[1:22:38] brother i got to get a prayer cloth and
[1:22:40] i got to get him i got him
[1:22:43] he said just do the vice versa
[1:22:47] when i want to go hunting deer i go to
[1:22:49] the woods
[1:22:52] now if i'm confused
[1:22:55] and i want to go hunting deer
[1:22:58] i'm going to open that door up right
[1:22:59] there and i'm going to just watch
[1:23:00] highway 52 i mean 23.
[1:23:03] and every once in a while maybe in about
[1:23:05] i have seen one down at the end of the
[1:23:07] road maybe in about 25 or 30 years a
[1:23:09] deer may come by
[1:23:12] right
[1:23:14] that's what satan is telling you about
[1:23:16] the world
[1:23:17] stay right here it's coming
[1:23:19] no you go hunting in a different spot
[1:23:22] same way in sanctification if you go to
[1:23:24] the bars quit going to the bars
[1:23:28] if you listen to
[1:23:29] what is it ryan christian rock croc
[1:23:31] music
[1:23:33] if you listen to that stuff get away
[1:23:35] from it do the vice versa
[1:23:39] you'll be surprised at what
[1:23:41] station you turn on the radio will help
[1:23:43] your
[1:23:44] spirituality
[1:23:48] say oh brother well do something
[1:23:51] quit listening to rap music quit
[1:23:52] listening to country music that talks
[1:23:54] about your drunk mama and your three
[1:23:55] four wives
[1:23:57] that's what i couldn't understand when i
[1:23:59] was growing up
[1:24:01] they talk about um you know kiss and all
[1:24:04] them other rock heavy metal rock bands
[1:24:06] it talks about drugs and
[1:24:08] and sex and alcohol and that's just so
[1:24:10] bad but now let's listen to country
[1:24:11] music
[1:24:12] all country music was was d-i-v-o-r-c-e
[1:24:16] and my mama got drunk and went to prison
[1:24:18] and
[1:24:19] it's all bad
[1:24:22] even some of this christian junk they're
[1:24:24] trying to put down our throat it's bad
[1:24:25] too
[1:24:28] but i'll tell you one thing listen to
[1:24:29] the words because sometimes the words
[1:24:31] can be anointed just forget about who's
[1:24:33] saying them toby michael whoever's
[1:24:34] saying the different things they're
[1:24:35] doing the best they can with what they
[1:24:37] got
[1:24:38] but listen to the words the words are
[1:24:39] inspired
[1:24:40] all right i don't know why i got onto
[1:24:42] that
[1:24:43] look watch this he gives you a new
[1:24:44] spirit make your nature a little more
[1:24:47] gentle and settle down
[1:24:51] or he couldn't even live with you
[1:24:55] wow now if i believe brother brown was
[1:24:57] the prophet right okay i'm just reading
[1:24:59] you what he said about sanctification
[1:25:02] or he couldn't even live with you
[1:25:05] so he has to get you fixed up first i
[1:25:08] like that good old kentucky english
[1:25:10] he's got his uh no offense um
[1:25:14] our northern brethren and sisters
[1:25:17] so he has to get you fixed up first
[1:25:20] before he can come in
[1:25:22] i'll give you a new spirit then you take
[1:25:25] him anywhere
[1:25:27] you go all kinds of places he's got to
[1:25:29] get you fixed so you can entertain him
[1:25:31] right wow
[1:25:33] now how can you entertain god in a bar
[1:25:34] how can you entertain god playing rap
[1:25:35] music how can you entertain god cussing
[1:25:37] the whole time that's what i'm telling
[1:25:38] you sanctification is the place that we
[1:25:41] need to realize where we're at and then
[1:25:44] move on through that and not say that's
[1:25:46] the new birth and settle down right here
[1:25:48] and don't get anything else from god
[1:25:51] because remember that unclean spirit
[1:25:53] that brother brown's talking about that
[1:25:55] went out all that's coming back
[1:25:58] if you don't get it sealed
[1:26:00] it'll be all right
[1:26:02] just a few more minutes and then we'll
[1:26:03] start right here this afternoon
[1:26:05] so that's when you're on the first altar
[1:26:09] but when you hide away
[1:26:12] you get his spirit
[1:26:14] then the holy spirit none other than god
[1:26:18] himself
[1:26:20] comes and dwells in you
[1:26:23] and then there's something about you the
[1:26:25] neighbors love you the people like you
[1:26:30] let's listen to this first peter one
[1:26:32] verse two
[1:26:34] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:26:36] god the father through what
[1:26:37] sanctification of the spirit
[1:26:39] what is sanctification clean and set
[1:26:40] aside for service and we're going to
[1:26:42] continue up because the statute of
[1:26:44] perfect man is what cleaned and set
[1:26:45] aside for service
[1:26:47] all right even though you're already in
[1:26:48] service as a believer there's other
[1:26:50] things you've got to do
[1:26:51] through the sanctification of the spirit
[1:26:54] unto obedience
[1:26:59] brother wave when you become obedient at
[1:27:01] sanctification
[1:27:04] not at the new birth
[1:27:05] you become obedient at sanctification
[1:27:08] that's what i'm telling you if you don't
[1:27:10] come one more time if you don't come to
[1:27:12] church but half the time you're not even
[1:27:14] sanctified
[1:27:18] it's time to wake up
[1:27:21] spiritually and physically
[1:27:23] because this thing's gonna the door's
[1:27:24] gonna shut on this thing and you go what
[1:27:28] where'd i miss it
[1:27:30] god's gonna tell you where you miss it
[1:27:32] you missed it by not being in church
[1:27:34] because you know what if you want to
[1:27:35] i've just i've not had a visitation from
[1:27:37] god in so long you ain't been a church
[1:27:40] i thought he said where two or three are
[1:27:42] gathered in his name he'd be right here
[1:27:43] in the midst so if you want to meet
[1:27:44] where god is there's a there's a number
[1:27:46] down well it's not on the door now but
[1:27:47] used to that at ten o'clock and at two
[1:27:49] o'clock that's when god shows up here
[1:27:52] and seven o'clock on wednesday night if
[1:27:53] you miss it then you'll miss your
[1:27:54] visitation from god
[1:27:57] i know we can't be here all the time but
[1:27:58] you know what some of you just don't
[1:27:59] come
[1:28:03] but you're a believer yeah you believe
[1:28:04] in something
[1:28:06] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[1:28:08] jesus christ grace and peace and you be
[1:28:11] multiplied let's read this right here
[1:28:12] before musicians get ready to come i
[1:28:14] love this little
[1:28:16] sermon called intervale in sturgis
[1:28:20] michigan
[1:28:22] god prophesied through the prophet and
[1:28:24] said i will write my laws in their heart
[1:28:26] where i put them in the tables of their
[1:28:27] heart
[1:28:29] showing
[1:28:30] that that would be the dwelling place of
[1:28:32] god
[1:28:33] in the human heart
[1:28:35] not the human head
[1:28:37] but the human heart amen i will write
[1:28:40] them in my heart in their heart
[1:28:42] and they'll keep my statutes and so
[1:28:44] forth this is the sanctification we're
[1:28:46] supposed to keep the statues
[1:28:50] god sent in another place over in
[1:28:51] ezekiel said i will in that day take out
[1:28:53] your old
[1:28:55] fleshly stony heart and i'll give you a
[1:28:57] new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you
[1:29:00] now a lot of people
[1:29:02] even you pentecostal people
[1:29:04] a lot of times get mistaken in that you
[1:29:07] get a new spirit that's not god's spirit
[1:29:10] that's you
[1:29:12] that isn't god you get a little happy
[1:29:15] because you get a new spirit and you
[1:29:16] jump up and down and run around on the
[1:29:18] floor maybe and shout a little bit speak
[1:29:20] in tongues everybody still believe
[1:29:21] brother brown with the prophet i'm
[1:29:22] reading health it's not my words it's
[1:29:24] his
[1:29:25] and thank you god the holy ghost that's
[1:29:27] not it
[1:29:30] that's a new spirit god gave you
[1:29:32] amen that's right that's you
[1:29:35] then after he give you your spirit then
[1:29:38] he said i'll put my spirit that's what's
[1:29:40] the matter with the missed meal cramps
[1:29:42] you get today
[1:29:44] that's right that's the reason you can't
[1:29:46] get nowhere with god what grow you can't
[1:29:48] grow with these virtues without having
[1:29:49] god in your heart
[1:29:52] notice you put a new spirit god has to
[1:29:55] give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[1:29:57] even get along with him
[1:29:59] amen you can't get along with yourself
[1:30:03] that old devil spirit you had in you
[1:30:07] so he's got to put a new spirit in you
[1:30:09] so you can get along with his spirit
[1:30:12] amen
[1:30:15] i will put a new spirit in them and i
[1:30:17] will put my spirit in them he said
[1:30:20] after he's given you a new spirit that's
[1:30:22] you
[1:30:23] don't get it confused with god's spirit
[1:30:25] it's not
[1:30:26] it's your new spirit so you can get
[1:30:28] along with the holy spirit
[1:30:30] if he ever gives it to you
[1:30:35] so it's not automatic
[1:30:39] because you and your condition
[1:30:41] never
[1:30:42] get along
[1:30:44] what with god
[1:30:45] you can't get along with your wife you
[1:30:48] can't get along with your husband
[1:30:50] you can't get along with your neighbor
[1:30:52] how are you ever going to get along with
[1:30:54] god
[1:30:55] so he has to give you a new spirit
[1:30:57] before you can even get along with him
[1:31:00] so he puts a new spirit in you
[1:31:02] and then he puts his spirit in you
[1:31:05] gives you a new spirit a new outlook
[1:31:08] that's what i mean if you don't have a
[1:31:09] new outlook you're not even
[1:31:10] sanctification
[1:31:14] a new outlook a new faith
[1:31:18] a new faith
[1:31:20] to what not have faith in the world have
[1:31:22] faith in god
[1:31:24] then he puts his holy spirit
[1:31:27] in you and that's what we'll talk about
[1:31:28] this afternoon we'll start with the
[1:31:29] baptism of the holy ghost let's stand
[1:31:31] our feet
[1:31:32] god bless you
[1:31:35] hope i'm not been too hard but i want to
[1:31:37] nail this thing down before we even get
[1:31:38] up talking about the virtues
[1:31:41] because like i just said and i'll read
[1:31:42] the quote this afternoon without the
[1:31:45] holy ghost
[1:31:46] the virtues are a stumbling block to the
[1:31:48] believer
[1:31:49] to people that look around you and all
[1:31:51] these different things
[1:31:52] because they see you doing this
[1:31:56] and you claim to be a christian they see
[1:31:58] you doing this over here
[1:32:00] cheat lie still
[1:32:03] out on the late fishing on sunday that's
[1:32:05] when you usually meet your neighbor
[1:32:10] did i say that
[1:32:14] that's usually when you meet your
[1:32:15] neighbor
[1:32:16] and he's going to go
[1:32:20] aren't you supposed to be in church
[1:32:21] because he's not
[1:32:22] he don't claim to be anything
[1:32:25] but you claim to be something then
[1:32:27] you're out there
[1:32:28] whatever
[1:32:30] listen take a vacation do whatever you
[1:32:32] want to do that's fine i don't i don't
[1:32:35] advoc advocate you coming to church
[1:32:36] every sunday you know that
[1:32:39] but i swear just because you don't come
[1:32:41] that
[1:32:42] you ain't got you know what i'm saying
[1:32:44] you're not sanctified if you don't have
[1:32:45] an excuse
[1:32:46] and what an excuse is an excuse
[1:32:49] if you take a vacation that's fine i
[1:32:50] don't
[1:32:51] don't bother god i don't think brother i
[1:32:54] i was thinking the other day
[1:32:57] i was listening to a tape or something
[1:32:59] and anyway from that tape in september
[1:33:01] or october brother brown said i'm going
[1:33:03] hunting with the with the boys or the
[1:33:05] men we're going hunting
[1:33:06] out in arizona wherever he went
[1:33:08] and it was like three weeks later before
[1:33:10] his next sermon that was taped
[1:33:14] so he went hunting he said we're going
[1:33:15] hunting
[1:33:16] that's why when they asked him you know
[1:33:18] about going to church he said now if
[1:33:19] you're way out there in the woods and
[1:33:21] you ain't got a church to go to he said
[1:33:23] keep on hunting
[1:33:24] because i'm not saying he did but i'm
[1:33:25] telling you there was a gap of three
[1:33:27] weeks he didn't preach on a tape when he
[1:33:29] went hunting during october november he
[1:33:30] always went there and he had it he had a
[1:33:32] deer hunting
[1:33:33] um what do you call it he just had a
[1:33:36] whole lineup of going hunting with the
[1:33:37] brothers
[1:33:39] so i'm not an advocate of you having to
[1:33:41] do that but you know what i'm i'm not
[1:33:43] also not an advocate that
[1:33:45] well why didn't you come to church and i
[1:33:47] had one guy tell me
[1:33:49] because we just wanted to take a sunday
[1:33:50] off
[1:34:00] that one sunday you take off maybe the
[1:34:02] day the rapture takes place and uh guess
[1:34:03] what
[1:34:07] god's gonna take born again people home
[1:34:09] he's not gonna take people with
[1:34:10] sanctification home
[1:34:13] only with the new birth is he gonna take
[1:34:14] you in the rapture
[1:34:17] sanctified you might become a foolish
[1:34:19] virgin and you might be so fooled you're
[1:34:20] not even a virgin not even a foolish
[1:34:22] virgin
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:26] sorry about that but i'm not really
[1:34:29] let's sing a song

[1:36:13] worship thee
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:17] you know i'm sorry i'm spending so much
[1:36:19] time but you know the foundation if you
[1:36:20] ask billy gary krantz what's the what's
[1:36:22] the what's the to make sure the house is
[1:36:25] being built right
[1:36:26] to make sure it's going to last and
[1:36:28] stand
[1:36:29] you spend a lot of time on that
[1:36:30] foundation
[1:36:32] and you know what it's kind of messy you
[1:36:33] got to dig down deep on one side it may
[1:36:35] be unlevel it may be that you've got a
[1:36:37] poor footing and that footing's got to
[1:36:39] be so thick
[1:36:41] it's got to be so deep why because all
[1:36:43] that pressure of that house is going to
[1:36:44] sit right down on that foundation
[1:36:47] everything you build on top is sitting
[1:36:49] on that foundation and if it's what
[1:36:51] built on shifting sand
[1:36:53] it'll move
[1:36:57] where's brother aaron i can't remember
[1:37:00] we were going across they were building
[1:37:02] a new bridge
[1:37:03] and you could hear it from a long way
[1:37:04] off have you ever heard that thing
[1:37:06] it's driving that that um uh i-beam
[1:37:11] and they're driving it through the water
[1:37:13] into the mud and they're they gotta
[1:37:14] pound on it until it hits solid rock
[1:37:17] because think about a bridge
[1:37:19] with so much water running by and and
[1:37:21] all the different traffic and
[1:37:22] everything's shaking
[1:37:24] they sat there
[1:37:27] it'd be nerve-wracking if i had to
[1:37:29] listen to that all day but you know what
[1:37:30] once it gets to the bottom it
[1:37:32] goes because what is hit rock
[1:37:36] and that's what's god doing to me and
[1:37:37] you
[1:37:38] make sure that foundation is right
[1:37:41] bang bang every sunday every wednesday
[1:37:43] every time you pray every time you read
[1:37:45] your bible every time you study every
[1:37:46] time you talk to the brethren
[1:37:48] it's god pounding what compacting
[1:37:52] so that we make sure that when we start
[1:37:54] building that bridge
[1:37:56] that you're not going to fall
[1:38:00] i read the scripture a couple of sundays
[1:38:02] ago
[1:38:03] if you get these things put in you
[1:38:05] you'll never fall didn't say you
[1:38:06] wouldn't fail
[1:38:07] we fail every day
[1:38:09] but you'll never fall you about your
[1:38:10] building will never collapse if you
[1:38:12] build it right the first time that's
[1:38:14] what i want us to do make sure from this
[1:38:15] point on that we built the house right
[1:38:18] we've got the right foundation and that
[1:38:20] we've got the right tools to go where we
[1:38:23] need to go that's another thing you have
[1:38:25] to have the right tools to build with
[1:38:28] and it did come from i know when i
[1:38:29] worked with with um brother joe's dad it
[1:38:33] was hammering nails man you had to have
[1:38:34] you had your little belt with all the
[1:38:36] nails in it you had a hammer and you had
[1:38:38] a big hammer the big for the big nails
[1:38:40] and the smaller hammer for the little
[1:38:41] nails and man your arm and your wrist
[1:38:42] brother george had a wrist buddy you
[1:38:44] don't ever grab a hold of him he'd grab
[1:38:46] a hold of you buddy why because he built
[1:38:48] 20 houses a year and this is all he did
[1:38:50] well you know what now brother gary how
[1:38:52] many times you do that
[1:38:53] not very many you know why
[1:38:56] don't
[1:39:00] you let air do it why because we
[1:39:02] progressed in revelation
[1:39:04] it's okay to build a house with a hammer
[1:39:06] but it's built quicker
[1:39:08] when you use technology
[1:39:10] and you put that house together and
[1:39:11] that's the same way with god
[1:39:13] god is going to build us up
[1:39:16] the right way if we have the right
[1:39:17] foundation
[1:39:19] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[1:39:20] this day that you give us
[1:39:22] i pray that you forgive us of our sins
[1:39:23] and our mistakes that we make against
[1:39:25] you lord
[1:39:26] i pray father that you would anoint
[1:39:28] every one of us lord
[1:39:30] as our goal from the first of this year
[1:39:32] is to let it out whatever it is lord we
[1:39:34] need to let it out let it be displayed
[1:39:37] and if we if we find out that it's the
[1:39:39] devil then we can do something about it
[1:39:41] we can expose him
[1:39:43] we can make it so uncomfortable that
[1:39:44] he'll want to leave this house
[1:39:47] and father to the lord the the sweetness
[1:39:49] of the holy spirit we know that
[1:39:51] that you reside in our heart lord and
[1:39:53] it's a sweet smelling savior lord
[1:39:56] it's something that we can live with and
[1:39:58] even as the prophet said even in
[1:39:59] sanctification you give us a
[1:40:01] you take that old hard spirit out and
[1:40:03] you start softening us up lord so that
[1:40:04] you can put your holy spirit inside of
[1:40:06] us
[1:40:07] father be with us
[1:40:09] as we go eat a bite lord that you'll
[1:40:10] bring us together back at two o'clock we
[1:40:12] ask you to be with each one be with
[1:40:14] sister mary come on you again lord and
[1:40:15] touch our body lord as we pray in jesus
