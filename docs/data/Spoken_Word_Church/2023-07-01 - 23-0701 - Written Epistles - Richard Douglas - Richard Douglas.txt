little simp talk tonight could you stand for the reading his word in 2 Corinthians starting at verse uh chapter 3 just a few little things to encourage you I'm going to plow the ground up pretty up good for brother Mike in the morning he just he come water it up for us then God bring the increase and we'll we'll have something you know even if one one sewed one watered no increase just be a wet rotten seed so it's it's all about God he has to to bring it to fruition he has to do it it's it's a three-fold purpose amen I love that we begin reading it verse one 2 Corinthians chapter 3 says Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or do we as some other others Epistles of commendation to you to letters of commendation from you it says ye are our epistle written in in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be Epistle of Christ ministered by us not written with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to godward not not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of other of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God I like that Paul is telling look I don't have no sufficiency in myself I I don't need commendations of any man God has Vindicated me he's verified that I would be the messenger to this age I would be the one that would come and open the door to the Gentiles and God just proved it he proved who he was I like in one place when we all that stuff was going on I like in one place and Paul said you've you've challenged me on my what God has given me he said but now I challenge you that he he said see if you're in the faith or not I challenge you to know whether you're in the faith that's what God's challenging us this afternoon is to want to know are you in the faith it's the faith in you is it not it's not just head knowledge but it's a living Oracle inside of your heart that's what Paul's telling us here written Epistles written Epistles it's been written of God it's been thought of God it's been a thought then it come to letter form now it's come to manifestation time Hallelujah let's pray father God what a privilege it is to stand Lord For You Lord what an honor I thank you Lord for touching me today god father I believe that there's something Supernatural going to happen in these meetings god father we've come with great expectation Desiring to hear from you lord I can't do anything for them Lord but father I can give you my gift so father you take my lips you take my body and you do whatever you want to Lord for I'm just here to serve you Jesus father I ask you to do these things knowing that your will Lord touch those that wasn't able to come Lord and bless those those that are out traveling God and just manifest yourself here tonight God in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you may be seated I like the way it reads over in the if I say it right the anotic Greek doc I guess that's how you say it you know I'm old country boy so I don't know some those fancy words so God didn't need a he didn't need me to know fancy stuff he need me to obey him I like how it starts off when it reads in the in the Greek the the do it says we are beginning again we're being again to recomend ourselves or do we require as some recory letters of you or from you ye are our letter written in our heart known and being read of all men it being plainly declared that ye are a letter of Christ Oh Glory I like that a letter of Christ amen by us come on now and written not hallelujah boy I tell you if that don't make you shout not written of a man God has written this letter God has ordained it he has for ordained all this he said with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not Stone tables not on Stone tables but fleshly tables of the heart and such confidence God we have through the anointed amen oh my brothers and sisters we can't lose when we have a recommendation like that from God it's already written brothers and sisters God's going to have a bride it's already been spoken yes what we're here to do is to fulfill out the written word for our eye amen we're here to bring forth what God manifested in your life has written that you would do he has come to bring that to fruition to your life that's what Paul's saying it's not written with hand it's not written with ink not written on Stones no more it written on the Ten Commandments on the stone but now I'm writing it in your heart amen not in your cart come on brother on brother in your heart didn't David say he had a he had a revelation he had a place to where he come to he said I've hid Thy word in my heart amen that sin not against you amen he knew it had to come from here it do just come from here with words it had to be an expression of what God had done oh Hallelujah Glory I'm fixing get fired up here amen I like being fired up hey I've been fighting the devil all week so boy I'm going to give it to him he he deserves it he deserves every bit of I'm going to give it to him let's see what the let's look at what the prophet say said about written epistle he said in the hidden life with Christ he said God didn't put you here to work in a factory just alone he put you here for a purpose right he put you here as a testimony amen a written epistle read of all men to live honorable and a decent life and a he consecrated with God so that men would know that Jesus Christ still lives and Reigns GL that's what we're here to do is to manifest that God's still alive God didn't die in 1965 God's still the same am he's an unchangeable God Amen oh Hallelujah I like how I look I got to look at this Christians are letters of recommendation living Epistles for Jesus Christ you're the recommendation to this world what kind kind of bride God desires amen you're the only Bible somebody will read it's a manifested word for this he's manifesting his desires through his bride yes amen she is him in bright form amen it's written of us amen oh I like what Jesus said he said behold over Hebrew said behold I come in the volume of the book to declare Thy word amen that's what we are we're here to declare the word of God turn with me to the Book of Proverbs just for a minute verse seven I hope you don't mind me me reading many scriptures if you do you'll get over it amen hey we're going to read them amen I believe it cuz I believe this message come right out of the Bible amen we wouldn't believe it if it wouldn't it no brother BR said even if I say something ain't in this Bible he said don't believe it he made it simple for us brothers and sisters and he and US ministers he made it he said just say what I say I like that amen I like that we needed to blueprint man had messed this thing up that's right brother man had this written epistle all messed up he thought it was a church a building yeah he thought it was an organization or the Catholic church or the Baptist or whatever church it was but he's God come and S a problem let us know it's an individual walk with God you know tonight you're the church you're the Church of the Living God Amen not this building you are that's right brother the character of the church is the people amen you're when you're out there you if we I believe we'd have less and less trouble if we'd know who we're representing come on brother we're ambassadors right we'd act different I believe a lot of people would act different they wouldn't act like that because you're here to represent Jesus Christ amen amen people are looking at you when you do crazy stuff and act like you're Christian and you ain't and people see it it brings a reproach on the church God expects Holiness that's why he s the Holy Ghost amen he's watching us amen he's got a tutor over us don't claim something you ain't got just live it say God I want I want the doer living in me I like what James said he said don't be a hearer be a doer without do you'll never live this message don't fool yourself right oh Hallelujah that's right Proverbs 7 veres 1 through3 listen to this I love the way Solomon does it he he's like he's teaching I mean God gave outside of Jesus Christ this this man God gave him something special he gave him a heart of understanding that he can understand how to deal with God how he can handle God's people so he's telling he's leaving just like the prophet was sent here for to turn turn us back to the faith of the fathers to get us back to instructions man that done ruin the instructions of Goden that's right verse one says my son keep my words and lay up my Commandments with thee am he said keep my Commandments and live see that's that's a commandment keep my Commandments and live you get this is a live life amen this is not just word life right right it's a life living in you he said keep my Commandments and live he said in my law as the apple of thine eye bind them up upon thy fingers write them upon the tables of thine heart right say say unto wisdom Thou Art my sister and call understanding thy kinswoman boy ain't that what God sent us in this hour yeah sent us a revelation so we know what was what Amen brother said man pred at it poked at it they had truth but they couldn't tie the loose ends up there had to be somebody come and tie up to Loose Ends to bring this thing back to Jesus Christ am to bring him back as the chief Source where everything starts at Jesus Christ right amen man in this hour we live in they're all scrupled up yeah they say you can get to heaven anyway you don't need Jesus I said you're going to hell if you don't go through Jesus sir there is no other way he said I am the way the truth the light besides me there is none Hallelujah I'm thankful for the truth man where will we be without the truth bu we be in big trouble boy I like this right here talking about the written Epistles Jeremiah 1:5 when you real realize that God knows God knew you before you was ever born he had a he had a design for you that you was going what you was going to be right before you was ever born look what he tells Jeremiah in Jeremiah chap 1 verse 5 he said before I form before I huh yeah right you say well that Mom and Daddy did that no before I yeah remember he's all source of life oh Hallelujah before I formed the in the belly I knew the amen glory be to God Amen I told Satan put that in your pipe and smoke it yeah huh he'll choke him he knew us yeah he fored us he chose us he predestinated us amen he had a purpose amen he said I knew thee Y and before thou camest forth out of the womb I love this I Sanctified thee woo he said and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations brother you can't make yourself a prophet God has to call you God's got a place just like the fivefold ministry no man can take you when you get to the realization nobody can take your place you don't worry about who's the best preacher and who's this and who's that you say well hey God called me to do what I'm going to do my portion God let me fulfill what you've written for me to do in my life for you I'm not worried about what my brother does I'm worried about what God has said for me to do I want to fulfill my part am oh hallelujah amen I like it a recommendation of God yeah a letter yeah recommendation yeah he wrote of you yeah right amen he knew you before you was ever born amen predestined ated you called you and elected you for this hour I believe one brother said one time I like this right here one brother said you know if we had know the end of this thing we'd have volunteered for it brother Mike I believe we did I said wait a minute I believe we did I believe when we was there just like when that he said he'll go down that Lon Spirit come up said I'll go down I believe we stand out because he asked job where were you job when the sons and God danced before the Lord we was there we I Pastor our the because we we're going back if you never come from there you can't go back there I believe I believe we put our hand up brothers and sisters we'll go down we'll go down lord he said that's what I I knew you'd go down I just waiting on you to go ahead and fulfill what I read I already written you to be here when you realize that you R say can't do nothing to you unless God let him he couldn't touch job n right he couldn't do nothing to job job was written look I mean this could have this should have woke Satan up you know his brain dead we know that he's worse than he's ever been since Calvary but look at this this look at God what God says about job he said he's a perfect man there's nothing like him s just said whoa wait a minute I I don't think I can mess with him when you when God says something it's going to manifest brother FR said don't you try to do it let God do it right it's God manifesting himself through US am as Christians and as Sons and Daughters of God we ought to be such a like such a striking likeness to Jesus Christ we be such a reflection of him right that's what he expects amen amen hey they can say what they want to about brother Brandon show me one of them that ever got mistake for Jesus Christ amen I didn't yeah because I know it was Jesus Christ working through him but they ain't got one out tell brother Mike that ever had that kind of Ministry live so close to God that they thought he was God I like what one Minister said about him what a great thing he would say about the prophet he said it was like the Old Blacksmith when he was in the blacksmith he put the iron in the fire and the fire and the iron become one he said that's the way brother Brandon was he said he lived so close to God you couldn't tell a difference brother that's the way the bride ought to be living God expects a lot out of us we've been he's requirement of us amen but little known little required we can't say that we know a lot God has G us the full word in this eye he expects a lot out of you but guess what he expects you to surrender that he can fulfill it I like this a living biography of our father that's right that's Hallelujah woo he WR the book and he said here it is I talked about it on the page but here's the living biography you know you read a book about somebody's life but when you see the one that was was yeah that's the living biography of it this is it that's what he's saying about this bride amen she's the living biography of what I what I what I desire and I love how the prophet said that he said this bride will not fail amen why cuz he's word word word amen oh my she's the oh my she's the manifested word for her eye she's a manifestation of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen not just professors but possessors lot of people professed this message for years and walked away but something happened in my life and I couldn't work that go when it comes down to it and they and that happens where can you go right brother G this message Jesus amen amen this message ain't nothing but Jesus Christen amen we are his images amen he created us amen that he might manifest himself through us you know what even Peter in his backsliding condition when he denied Christ you know what betrayed him is speech they said we know you've been with him huh didn't even didn't even didn't even the Sadducees and Pharisees when he come to him he said what why didn't you bring him why didn't you bring him to it he said they said never a man SP like this man never a man never a man he there's amazing this man don't even have learning he was the word made flesh the scriptures told what he was he said search the scriptures for any you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify me amen the very word that testified of him they denied him amen cuz he didn't come like they wanted him to right brothers and sisters God's not going to bring stuff like we want it to he's going to bring it like he wants it amen hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah the word epistle is a adopted letter as the book of the New Testament do you know the New Testament the book of Acts is the only book that didn't end with an amen cuz we're finishing out the amen amen it's wasn't the acts of the Paul say that's act I said no brother Bram told ain't you glad the prophet told us that he said it was the acts of the Holy Spirit through the apostles amen amen it didn't bother Satan when it come back to him said look at here there's been 10,000 he didn't get up brother said didn't even move you but when they started manifesting blinded eyes come on now lame walk dead raised boy he jumped up said whoa yeah wait a minute we got to stop this thing yeah he didn't know that it multiplied when it went down when that seed come back up it multiplied and he ain't been able to stop it since and he cannot stop it the multiplication of God cannot be stopped never right amen just like a painter when he has a vision he has a vision of what he's painting nobody else can see it but God had a vision of what his bride was going to be like all he's doing is getting the fine brush work done right on mine and your life amen oh hallelujah amen glory be to God he is our Perfection he's our everything amen without him we're nothing let's read what the prophet said about written Epistles you want see amen I love what I love it thirsting for life he said and the life that is within you boy I like that makes think about that makes you a written epistle amen read of all men the life that's in you yeah makes you a written epistle amen not that old nature no brother not that old Richard no it's that life that lives in there now amen that ho still there yeah one day it's going to burst right open amen it's going to give way amen and behold I stand at the door and knock he said if you're the Sal of the earth then you got to live such a life a written epistle till all men will know what you are amen amen oh God just didn't bring it here for just any old thing he wants man to know what you are yes sir you don't even a lot of times we don't even know what we are but Satan knows exactly who you are amen that's why he battles you he's trying to get you to disbelieve what God said you are right and sometimes we suffer from Amnesia because we get through so many trials and this and that and all those things but you it didn't change God when the when hey when the prodical son left y the father knew he was coming home yeah he did right he knew he was going to go out there and waste everything yeah but he said he's still my son amen but you know what I was about that how that is but you know what it BR out it BR out the jealousy of the older brother he was always jealous of the younger brother but that when he said kill the calf give him the robe give him the shoes give him that sigment Dad you never done he said it was always here you know why we don't get stuff from God cuz we don't ask we'll see God bless some I then we get disappointed you know why you don't get it cuz you don't ask for it said when we ask we ask to miss right brother said just ask amen extreme things amen right God in an extreme business amen when my mother got got me as a young child and was adopted boy she asked for God to create ankle bone right they said he'll never walk brother Mike never walk God said that ain't what I that ain't what I Oh Glory that ain't what I wrote that's right that ain't what I wrote amen see that's our problem we don't look at the written right brother it's written of us amen glory no matter what the no matter what the doctor says am don't matter what people say it's what's written amen oh Hallelujah Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever he said but when we are Christians and say we're Christians and live like Christians Our Lives will do it for do it if we never

Jesus man it ain't about a t it ain't about the bumper stickers and all that stuff it ain't about Bel buckles no huh it ain't about that stuff it's about a written life in your heart amen it's about the manifestation of Jesus Christ Living Through you amen oh Hallelujah he said our lives we are written Epistles read of all men right so they watch how you walk well I remember that when I was out in the out in the world the Lord delivered me from all those drugs and stuff like that they was was a guy I worked with and he was supposed to be a pastor brother Mike and he kept telling me you need what I got and had such a nasty attitude I mean rant and raving it's kind of comical what I told him I said hey I take drugs not to be like you I said you telling me what you got I want and I said I'm taking drugs so I don't act like you but see when Jesus got a hold of me I didn't have to act like it that's right come on he took it out of there amen so leave what you preach amen said don't preach me a sermon leave me one that's the greatest testimony you can ever do is live he said written Epistles read of all men I want them to be able to pull back the pages of my life and see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen I love this in Jezebel religion Satan hated that sermon did told on him oh it still gets him it's a it's a it's a dagger to the heart yeah I love it too it says you want to live what you you talk about boy I love that if you don't live it yourself how could you expect somebody else to live it this you see people misrepresenting this message you need this message and they don't even believe this message it's a shame we had a brother had a brother at church and he was you know he's just come off drugs and stuff and he he thinks he's ready to do something you know and so guess guess who gets talks to me you know and I just tell him I tell him like I got you you got to be straight up brother M you can't play with that and I know what it's like to be there cuz you need the Holy Ghost you'll never get rid of that thing you'll never get rid of that nature you got you'll never get rid of the desires of the flesh until you've been born again and he was want to do something he was want to get a bus and do all these things he might be listening he he may shoot me for this but that's okay but I mean I'm I want to tell the truth and I'm going to tell the truth right you know I tell I said what you need the Holy Ghost you I said how can you sell a product you don't even have right or how can you do anything I said I said the scriptures tells you he told Peter when you're converted strength your brother you're not going to be able to go down there and witness to those drug acts and you ain't even got rid of it yourself right and then you're going to bring a greater shame because you're going to profess something you a have you're going to be right back at they say yes see that Christian don't work never done him all it was was lip service but if you leave it I said you know what your this testimony of be young man I said for you to sat under a under a pastor quit floating around all over the place sat under a pastor and prove Satan Wrong by being stable right sit down and prove don't just flipflop two or three weeks and you back out and come back and then try to tell testimony let God do something amen people want a profession but they ain't willing to get desperate to get a possession amen true brother oh Hallelujah he say so written Epistles read of all men he said always be honest just true tell the truth you can't tell the truth that's your father you're of your of the devil cuz he said the truth is not in him Jesus told him right off yeah he did he said you said you're Abraham se but I tell you you're of your father the devil and he said his work you're doing right and they was amen they was manifesting the works of their father if your father if you had the spirit of say a great boxer Muhammad Ali you'd box yeah right yeah y then if you got claim to have the spirit of God you'll do his works right you'll live what you say you got well said if you had the spirit of John D you'd be shooting everybody you'd be robbing banks see that's what I believe that's a lot lot that's where a lot of people miss it brother way yeah is they miss that life that life is just that's the ain't nothing else

you you don't look for God God looks for you amen amen oh hallelujah amen do you realize we're we're going through a drama in our life God has already wrote this and right right we're going through this drama and brother Brown talked about how Shakespeare that drama and all this out and already knows and it's being manifest through me and you I want to just go a few I'm Gonna Let You Go I want to read a few quotes about this drama the deity of Jesus Christ he said I believe that we are facing he said well I like this brother Wade he said are you listening to me congregation says amen amen he said all right we are facing now look at look at the greatest drama that's ever been set in human history working out here before us the great field of the world here and the drama that God is going to act out right now he said that it's starting to look around over the world and see how the thing is moving together oh it's something fixing to happen friend this what we talked about and said about is right now here it's already starting everywhere breaking out and the message shalomi says it again talking about that he said now to you adults the scripture is God's Symphony he said yes hallelujah amen only the composer knows what really means and he reveals it to those who are listening right blessed are they that have ears blessed are they that have hearts Brother people don't hear what I hear you can't deny this message and hear what I heard he said those are who are listening and who are interested in it well he lays it out there but you would have to know about the sympathy first he said see it's just it's not just something you see it's the changing the Junctions of the word of the music it throws he said it throws people sometimes it's going this way while a certain beat after a while it changes all around what is it to you who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about it not interested in it boy he tells it he said it's just a racket right he said it's a fuss but oh I love that conjunction word don't you amen but but to those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming Hallelujah he said he's only going to come to those who are looking for his appearing yes he appeared in 1963 but he's coming back in a Corporal body I know people got spiritualized and think all that but he's coming back that's what he told us we'll see the scars in his hands spear in his side y oh Hallelujah my wife sent me this I had to share this week what is a standard something we measure ourselves by the Bible people try to make the Bible fit them when they just have to yield theel to the Bible and it'll make them fit it written Epistles read of all men do you know that a real drama I'm trying to close give me some Grace good I don't hold you all night I know you smell that chicken but you know there's five five stages in the drama do you know that I didn't know that I mean some of y'all may know that there's five stages in the drama and it forms a pyramid well there's something in that some of y'all guys that's teachers and know that thing you run with that thing you know the first stage of the drama is the exposition the second is the rising action the third is the climax the fourth is the falling action the fifth is the resolution i c it five stages of Grace Amen brother amen glory yeah hallelujah amen am the exposition look at this brothers and sisters the exposition the story's starting point the setting of the characters Oho my Hallelujah the extent of the story starts with the conflict woo that's right right when you receive Jesus Christ Christ as your savior is a conflict come on between this and this then brother Brown preach that message conflict between God and Satan right that's what we battling this man here right Paul said when I go to do good Evil's always present I like this the rising action what is the rising action it explores the story's conflict up to the climax often I like this often things get worse because of wrong decisions that's right whatsoever a man sewe that shall he reap don't fool yourself brother and sister a lot of stuff we battle is because we sowed it but if Grace wasn't here we'd really be in trouble he didn't say you wouldn't right brother get through it he said but you slded it Satan always blam well God's doing that cuz but you a lot of times we do it oursel brother Mike we get in a situation we make wrong choice you're going to pay for it cuz you're God's son he's going to he's going to chasen you for it no doubt and if you don't receive chasing it we know what that means I like that things get worse before they get better ain't that what's happening right now this is showing us what's fixing out we're fixing to get raptured it's getting worse the prophet told us it ain't going to get better it ain't going to happen they ain't going to no president get in our change this thing how can they override thus after the Lord amen I wish they would I mean hey but I don't want to slow down the Raptor cuz I'm ready to go I want to get out of here this old man he's my enemy look at this the first the third part of it is the climax every part of the drama is important but the climax is the landing spot or the turning point of the structure God have mercy something happened in this drama brother Mike and it turned woo and said you're not going to walk that way no more you're going to walk brother Glory it's a turning point yeah when Moses turned aside to see then he was ready to go down God has to get a man to stop and turn back that's right woo what a landing spot we were see eternal life yeah rure amen a new body the fourth part of it is the falling action is the aftermath of the climax it's the place where the director ties up the Loose Ends come on didn't God send a man and spoke to him to tie up the loose end glory be to godl there's been some loose ends tied up we don't have to guess we don't have to

close well God's going to not go get close to us if we're dirty right no he's not a dirty God so he don't like dirty people that's why I believe this message has the greatest sanctifying power that
