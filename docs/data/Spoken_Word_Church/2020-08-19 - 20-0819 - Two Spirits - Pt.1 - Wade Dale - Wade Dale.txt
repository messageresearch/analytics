your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy holy holy [Music] amen god bless you good to be in the house with lord good to be here what a wonderful huge crowd on the wednesday night just you have to esther you just gotta perceive that that was you know that somebody said when we came up here and did that service where it was just me and luis was the only in them in the sanctuary and you have to preach like you believe your kids are going to be sitting inside of you so you just believe that the benches were full and somebody asked well how'd it go i said nobody got up and went to the bathroom 12 times of service we pray for small bladders we do we do but anyway good to be in the house the lord um next sunday will be just the same thing the men and and sister extras included in the men so um if i don't call your name it's the men if you if you feel like you want to come on i don't i don't know about the older ones but the men you sure are welcome sunday we're going to be 10-1 just like we did before and we're going to continue that for at least the next two sundays all right so the net this coming sunday and the next sunday we're going to continue as we are just to see now uh the next saturday will be september the 6th the day before labor day and we may see about that's communion 72 we may see about brother dale and i'll talk about it about maybe taking communion or we may take drive through communion because i know pete i miss communion i miss communion foot washing i miss all those ordinances that uh if you're a christian you do you miss these things if it's if it's if it's a drudgery then you didn't miss it but if you miss it then you know you you really you want to have it so we'll we'll talk about that in two weeks as we continue on so uh god bless you uh also remember that august the 30th now that not just coming sunday but the next sunday brother dale myself will be going to the dedication of brother george's church that will be sunday morning one service do not have the details yet but i will get them knowing brother jewell they'll be out friday afternoon before saturday of this no saturday night of the sunday service he'll have him out so anyway i'll i'll get the details from him but he is feeling so much better sounding so much better so we're praying for all these other ones too brother donnie reagan and all the different ones that are being diagnosed and people all over the country being diagnosed so we we want to pray for them um as well so let's turn to the book of first john 4. tonight we're going to uh this is just going to be the beginning or the um outlay of how we're going to cover this and we're going to call it two spirits because there's only two spirits there's different kind brother brown said cancer with the spirit diabetes is the spirit all of them have different spirits but there's two power there's two spirits that we need to deal with and you've got one spirit here with everything under it and then you got one spirit over here with everything under it okay you got demon you got when we're gonna go all the way back to the beginning where god created satan uh sorry lucifer made him perfect made him the right hand man give him power up to creation right okay so we're going to start that but i want to go through this and i want to i want to caution you because i was praying about yesterday pray about this morning again at all every time you start talking about two spirits and then when we start talking about how brother brown talks about the two spirits in the framework of the church please do not get in your mind a person's name except jesus christ and the devil okay not a brother well you're talking about brother i'm come back two spirits and brother brown said they're not out there they're right here so i'm not worried about brett now brother so-and-so is and i'll read it maybe today or maybe save it for sunday brother brown says you go by the characteristics of that spirit right because you really can't tell he's just as religious listen they couldn't tell judas and jesus sat down at the table he washed judas's feet gave him communion and then he went and did what he'd done real quick and he had everybody fooled except jesus christ so in the end time he's going to have everybody fooled except jesus christ all right and who is jesus christ his bride his bride is not a second person his bride is jesus christ okay all right so then you got the two spirits so when we start talking we may make some comments about certain things but please don't put a well that's brother he's talking about i in my mind humanly yes those names will pop up humanly but i am not directing this toward any one person because you do have to cover the characteristics of what happens when you have one spirit and the characteristics when you have another the other spirit so please don't think and i did i cautioned myself two days ago yeah yeah last night and even this morning while i was working he came back up again to caution the people do not think that i have a name written down that i'm talking about this certain person or this certain group of people okay but now that group and that person we're going to just let their characteristics because remember jesus told them he said let's don't harvest this right now right he said wait till it matures because you go out of my garden now and you see mature okra but when it was only about this high it looked like a weed right so you let them both mature that's what we're going to discuss this afternoon you got to let them both mature that's why god didn't cut them down in luther's day he didn't cut them down in wesley's day he didn't cut them down in pentecost but when it comes over to where the full grain is that's when jesus said okay go put the sickle in and harvest separate burn and eject and that's exactly what's going to happen but we're going to go back to the beginning of time before time even was thank god for a prophet that could let us not just not just him brother louise let us go back into that same mind that he went back into and let us see the same thing he saw he come back and told us give us clarity so that when we do look over into that other dimension or that other place we know what we're looking at all right so see there's the two spirits i was thinking i was uh just for a second i was listening to the prophet how many times that he said he said i'll have to give an account for what i'm telling you with this bible open in front of me i tell you thus saith the lord and for somebody to say he was wrong see there we go we start going with names no characteristics it's a characteristic of the devil that's not god when it's anti-word but how in the world can you if you deny brother branham in one point you've got to deny that you've got to say that he lied 1100 and sometimes you got to say he lied when he went across the curtain of time you got to say he lied when he did this he like how in the world uh we had the pure unadulterated word given to us by a prophet that made human mistakes but his message was pure glorious and still is pure it has been made unpure by that other spirit amen so let's go to first john 4 and we'll get into this a little bit tonight let's pray before we get get started get somebody on your mind now as we pray you get somebody on your mind that's been sick uh that's that's ailing you just get somebody on your mind now unless and let's pray and see what god do also remember me uh i went yesterday to have a physical they don't do the from head to toe anymore i was expecting a full physical and i didn't get it he asked a lot of questions i could have lied you know how is this oh great you know but uh they did take blood and i have this thing right here in my throat that feels like somebody's finger sticking in it so it's the devil it's not god so it it kind of hinders me a little bit but we're going to walk on by faith he gave me a couple of things to take for acid reflux and then we're going to look a little bit further but we know god's a healer we know god's one is in control so we just pray that it's just aggravating it doesn't hurt it's just aggravating you ever had a piece of gum stuck in you or a pill stuck in the back of your throat or something that's the way it feels 24 7 with me so it's just aggravating but let's pray that that thing will not go any further all right so let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for this opportunity that you've given us to as we can sit here and listen to you father but lord you've used the devil's technology lord for your honor and glory and it's to let people sit at home and watch live online and be part of the service now father we pray that you would that you would go to each home and wherever the people may be lord and may they enter into the worship of the service father and may you anoint these lips and anoint the ears to hear father lord we pray everyone now has got someone on their mind and on their heart we pray lord that you would send your visiting angel lord to visit whatever the sickness or the person or the or the temptation or the trial someone's going through or or salvation or the different things that we that we under this token lord that we can call on your name father and know that that token has been applied lord we all have sicknesses in our bodies and things that go wrong we're getting older and things are wearing out but father you told us that you had a bomb you had a bomb in gilead and you were the physician that administered that bomb it wasn't in the wrong hands it was in the right hands all the time and we pray that you'd apply that to us all now father be with us in the furthermore service give us revelation lord because we love it in jesus name we pray amen first john 4 verse 1 says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses now we're going to cover that right there i'm going to tell you that just blew my mind because you know you can go ask the drunk if jesus is christ and he's going to say yeah yeah buddy i saw him last week but and you say well that's a confession we know that's confess it confesseth it's an ongoing thing but that word right there we're going to cover it probably sunday but not tonight we're just going to give an overview and then back up that word confesseth look it up in your in your uh concordance it talks about logos buddy now when you go to logos it is not the devil it's christ so that word confesseth that jesus in other words you know that person that logos is not just out there somewhere right it's right here so your confession comes from the logos that's inside of you well i about shouted the other day when i saw it because i just looked up confesses and i thought well you know everybody's good to confess and it's good to make a confession look that up in strong's you go to two different words and one is logos right to write to who god almighty confess us that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god because you know what even denominations even listen that other spirit knows he came in the flesh he knows that so then if he confesses that jesus is coming flesh is of god no he's not of god but if you confess that logos to the logos the lord said unto my lord when that connects there's the difference and every spirit that confesses here we go again and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god now look that's a higher order you come on up a little bit higher because you know what they know jesus christ came in human flesh back there i know you're standing but you won't sleep while you're standing up back there oh yeah jesus came in human flesh the son of man came in human flesh we know 2 000 years ago what's our revelation today folks that jesus christ is come in the flesh not was if you confess not that jesus christ is coming the flesh you're not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard see they heard remember saying deed doctrine go through the seals all right but now it's not a sane deed or a doctrine it's an incarnate person we've come into the apex of all this and that's what i got on my notes we get to it that it should come and even now already is it in the world this is john coming from the isle of patmos about 1896 antichrist listen when jesus christ came the antichrist came ye are of god little children and have overcome them what the anakin spirit because greater is he that's in you than heed us in the world amen they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world listen heareth them father son holy ghost baptism oh the world hears that oh yeah 99.9 of the people that's the way you've got to be baptized but that's not true they heareth we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us remember what we talked about the other day that trumpet gives an uncertain sound you talk to people about the the revelation that we have and it's not common to them so they don't even listen they're not hearing what you're saying they're hearing words but it has no place in them that's what jesus told the pharisees he said you're hearing what i said but there's no place for it to land inside of you he that is not of god here is not us hereby know we know we the spirit of truth all right and the spirit of error so hereby we know you may be seated in the lord's blessing to reading the word hereby ye know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error now we we've come to the place to where we were you know you can title these any way you want to and we were talking about doing uh uh naming it the uh trail the serpent but you know that's kind of aggravating to me to just have to tell what the devil's done i like to tell what god's done and then satan's always going to be there in opposition so let's just see what happens back then but now let's start right here and watch matthew 24 jesus told us verse 23 says then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not i preached on this many times before the only reason you are going to know that christ is not over there is why because he's right here amen you're saying now brother if you've got the same christ i've got we can talk but if you've got a christ that's different than mine we can't talk and it's obvious you won't have a very long conversation amen now i'm talking about the world but how much more as you come on in to get a little bit closer to the message of the hour where church is split over doctrines you got one church over here uh you know you got uh 900 something denominations in this message versus what brother brown said was out in the world and it is it's come to a place to where this is where all the denomination heads up baptist he's got methodist satan that is he's got them he's right here looking for me and you to slip up and fall go another way have another thought or idea contrary to the word of god amen that's why i want us to remember it's always word first amen word first it was a brother sent me something the other day and some brother in the philippines just you know put his little chart out again on daniel 70 weeks and and i just wrote back a comment i wrote he needs to read the bible he needs to read the bible the bible tells us clearly what daniel 70 week says but everybody says well i got a quote quote can't quote cannot contradict the bible but you can twist the quote but they can also twist the bible satan twisted it by one word that's what we're going to go back to in the garden of eden in a little while matthew 24 but look jesus now this is jesus talking then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christ remembering anointed ones it's not just false people false christs because they're going to show great signs and wonders don't you worry that's going to be that's going to be the downfall of many people if they don't have the holy ghost and even with the baptism of the holy ghost if you've not been taught correctly you're going to lean towards signs and wonders every time every time every time but as we've always said signs should follow the believer not believers falling after the signs and it happens and it's happening and it's always going to happen and those that look like maybe and here i go i'm not naming names but those that look like are false word faults doctrinally false folks they're going to have signs and wonders like you wouldn't believe because the anointing as bob was talking about the other day read that book god of this evil age read anointed ones at the end time they're so close so they're going to have signs and wonders i mean what are you going to do like brother dale said what are you going to do when somebody walks up to you and sticks to your finger and then sticks their finger in your nose and says i'll raise him 10 people and show you that i'm true what are you going to do i'm going to say praise god them 10 people got brought back to life but your spirit's wrong because it's contrary to the bible all right it's contrary to the word of god because watch this is what jesus said for there shall arise false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now we know the very elect cannot be deceived but we'll read some other quotes a little bit later on where you see now in the end time even people that that are uh spirit-filled people um you know running off on different things you know the holy ghost is it's wonderful but remember in the end time always remember this it's an anointing in the end time now not to the true belief i'm talking about it's an anointing though that falls remember we're reading joy we're going to bring it from the bible all the way through joel said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh so everybody's going to get the benefit of the feeling but somewhere they're going to deny one word right because satan got them by one word and by one word off it caused all this so how in the world are we going to stand up here and be one word off and go back to the garden of eden can't do that but listen you say well there's no way we can be one hundred percent jesus christ is one hundred percent wondering and we're supposed to have the mind of christ right then he made a way and it's called this end time message it's not called luther it's not called wesley that's part of it but it's called this end time message that sets everything apart so let's go to the first quote remember what jesus said it could deceive they shall deceive the very elect if it were possible but i love there in the bible in the book of revelations when we ever get to the book of revelations with this two spirits it says he that overcometh to him that overcometh what did you overcome you overcame that other spirit brother john that's real simple you say no i'll overcome alcohol and women and drugs and no you overcame my other spirit because it was right here it was working right here in the children of disobedience and that's us before we're born again and even after we get born again aren't we kind of a little disobedient i thought we needed that for obedience okay he's still working on me i hope this makes us all realize we still got a little work to do hey man so let's read the first quote i love this quote here this is 1953 god commissioning moses because watch the bible i said the bible spoke of you and on that on the days i said remember our troubles my brothers sister i'm telling you now it's not coming from communism in the outside world this is 1953 everybody russia was raising up everybody was going communism is the antichrist no then we're going to read another one down here where he says don't worry about russia so let's not worry about the united states let's don't worry about trump who's going to win who's not going to win okay because watch where it started it didn't start down here it's not coming from communism and the outside world it's right on the inside of us brother brown that's just way too close no that's right where it needs to be the antichrist is a religious spirit it started in seed back yonder in genesis through cain okay and boy you just waited we get into james 4 where it says when lust is conceived brings forth sin when sin is finished it brings forth death it's not bad to sin folks because we're sinners when sin is conceived brings forth death when we keep when he can when he continues on and that's what's going to carry that second spirit that's what we're going to talk about remember that second spirit is going to carry you to a physical death and a spiritual death now you may go to a natural death and have the other spirit the the the christ-like spirit the christ spirit or the holy ghost sure there's many people in the grave right now that the holy ghost is it was in them and now it's over in another dimension but now this guy over here there's no turning back away from this one once you get this one that's why that it's going to be so close in the end time but like brother brown said he said when you he said just a razor's edge and you're standing on it and you slip off one side of the other he said that that wedge continues and you don't get you never can if you ever took a an axe and hit something or watch the water go around something that's like this it never comes back it continues away and that's what we're talking about now is those two spirits they have to be separated brothers and sisters in this end time is the only time that those two spirits are going to come to head and they're going to be made manifest is in this end time all right just as we go up that statue of a perfect man satan is taking his perfect man and going up that statue of a perfect man you ever thought about that remember there's two spirits there's two there's twins in every revival there's two spirits satan's won't listen satan's problem is he's wanting to climb up above this right here he's wanting to be up here where no man is but him see he wants to be number one well god's not going to stand for that god didn't make him for that god made him to drive me and you to that amen all right it started in seed back under in genesis through cain because remember now look one thing's for sure i am not will not and cannot speak on two natural seed lines if you're on this one you're good if you're on forget that now cain we know where he came from but you got to remember have you forgot one thing eve had holy ghost in her soul so he had a holy ghost phil mama cain that is but cain when he come out and grew up he had to make a choice just like the rest of us when the lust disconceived brings forth sin when sin is finished brings forth death cain had an opportunity so you can't say well now listen you can say hold on you can say that from god's point of view which is eternal omnipotent omnipresent knows everything he knew that cain would go wrong okay so on that side brother brown said cain was serpent seed judas was the antichrist born well he still had a choice judas still has every person that was born on this earth has got a choice they can't be one person born different except jesus christ himself and he had to come to give us a choice amen it's kind of real simple but people try to make it so boy cain was just uh he blessed god he was just serpent seed well yeah he did come from the serpent he did have a seed in him that come from natural seed come from that serpent but his mama was a religious woman she was we're going to see her in our camp we forget that don't we oh abel adam was righteous adam adam adam adams when it sold us out folks wasn't eve it was adam's the one that sold us out why the second adam had to bring us back all right they'll be okay there we're going to start a little slow but it started in seed back under in genesis through cain cain offered the same kind of sacrifice he knelt down and prayed he'd done everything religious that abel done yes sir and jesus said the two spirits in the last days would be so close it would deceive the very elect if possible now remember if we were standing back and watching cain and abel we'd think abel was kind of like jacob he's a little lazy all he's got to do is take them sheep up on the thing and let them eat grass and do their business and haul them in at night kind of a lazy kid all right and here's kane i don't want to be that way but like me going out every day and toiling in that garden but you know what cain did though came put everything he had in the wrong thing but he put everything he had in that thing because god said that's not that's not the way it's beautiful i mean why would you look at why would john be on the isle of patmos and this this of a church would raise up and john looks over and admires the church admires the woman she was beautiful take rome take all the different things that we look at that's that i don't say the people i say the system is anti but look how beautiful it is oh it's just beautiful they got these great big churches and they they got these big hospitals and they that's okay that's okay but we know that that antichrist system is working in that right system the two spirits would be so close so what i'm saying cain and abel you're standing there looking at them you would have picked cain just like you would have picked esau and probably would have picked judas over all the other disciples because he was the one that had the money he was kind of the accountant guy keep everything level hey can we buy this can we buy that you know but he let it carry him on over to where he crossed the line and we'll talk to that about that later on not today well i'm just going to give you an overview of what we're going to talk about let's look at number two the end time 1954. now kane came and knelt at the gate not an infidel listen all this is going on in the world and and and the the iraq and iran and all the different places they love their god they'll die for theirs will you die for yours so the the antichrist spirit is we we got to quit looking at it as being so anti that we think so anti that we think that oh it's got to be i thought brother brown said it was in us i'll go back to the i'll go back to that quote where brother brown says it's right on the inside of us right all right number two now cain came and knelt at the gate not an infidel many are thinking of the antichrist being russia get it out of your minds never the antichrist is religious jesus said the two spirits would be so close he deceived the very elective possible don't worry about russia they're just a bunch of atheists yes but the antichrist sits right by you sister esther you're the only one sitting real close to tony so take your choice but the antichrist sits right by you i i'm listen the antichrist is right here he's working trying to tell me things in my mind put things in your mind amen if not please come up here and take over but it's a fight combat beast not picnic beast combat beast it's a fight whoever said this was going to be just listen we get our flowery bed of ease when everything's over we get to spend an eternity not having to worry about none of this anymore there'll be no two factions there'll be no two opinions there'll be no two spirits one spirit's gonna live for eternity one's gonna be done away well you gotta decide which one you want but the antichrist sits right by you that's the deceiver remember just the time that judas jesus christ came on the scene the antichrist came on judas about time jesus revealed himself as the son of god judas revealed himself just the time jesus went away judas went away just the time the holy ghost come the antichrist spirit come so remember you see the moving of the holy spirit you see like brother dale we've been talking about revival for a long time satan has his own revival too amen he fell a church faster than the believer's camp remit don't remember don't put it don't put don't put anything on that okay but he can fill up a church fast or why signs and wonders get everybody going get everybody happy together by feeling good get the song service going good let somebody play we'll have two bases instead of one we'll have you understand what i mean well what about the word wow let's get all happy first yeah that's the devil because we're going to go back and we're going to study his tactic because remember he's the worship angel he's the god song leader brother dick always hated when i always said that but but but he was he was the worship angel he was created to to be the apex of worship but remember what he did with that apex of worship he wanted to go higher than head than the head that made him i if i'm looking at a man that created me i should know real quick i'm always going to be number two he'll be number one but now remember though jesus christ was a creator but he what did he do with us he put a little man down here called william branham and there was some squirrels got created into existence there was things got we've seen things created we've seen things done so let's don't be so well i'm number two no you're part of number one and being part of number one makes you number one we just got to get rid of that other spirit that's haunting us and telling us other things you don't have to go to church now you can sit at home now all you got to do is press play all you got to do is press and i mean play like tonight play not press play we press play anytime we want to okay but i'm talking about wow we can click on and watch so and so and so and so on don't even have to go to church i've it's just not in me to miss this it's not in me to miss this there's a longing as brother brown said he said a holy ghost-filled person can't wait for the doors to open so that we can get in here to worship all right so just telling you some things that brother brown told us just the time judas went away judas went away just the time the holy spirit came the antichrist spirit came look and they were brothers in the same church i'm going to say one more time there's only two spirits two there's not three or four now there's a lot underneath but there's only the holy spirit and the antichrist or you can say jesus christ and the antichrist that's the only two spirits that they are so get that in your mind that then you won't talk like brother brown and bro i believe brother branham truthfully when he was talking about denominations he hated to say the things he did but he was talking about the system they were in but you got to remember though you got to remember if you make yourself part of that system you're the system that's why the bible says come out of her my people come out under that thing and be partakers of what the spiritual of the spiritual gift of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost all right look they were brothers in the same church i believe as we go back into the beginning or before the beginning i like brother brown says before the beginning before the eternal how can you do that well you have to start somewhere and you find that mine but you got jesus or you got christ whatever you want to call him you got the logos you've got the father standing here and there's another person standing beside of him and it ain't a second person of a trinity it's the other it's the guy he created to be right there beside of him and we're going to read that he didn't he didn't create the devil to go do his now he knew he would he knew he he knew listen he knew cain would but you can't say he was born serpent seed but you and i all were born serpent seed but not the seed not the little seed like you put in the ground no it's a seed of discrepancy it was not a literal little seed it was we were born wrong with a carnal mind which put us on this side but thank god we had a choice to get on this side well that took that what'd he do with that seed right oh well he destroyed your own nature but he used that same person for the glory of god right god don't have to see satan almost has to destroy people to have anything everything he touches cancer leukemia all that comes from from the devil so everything he's touching and trying to make good falls apart because he's always negative he's always on the negative side but see everything christ touches is eternal glory so when he touched your soul he made your soul return he changed you brother brown said from a kookaburra to a wheat oh now i got a quote where i always was wheat in the mind of god absolutely you got to remember brother branham spoke a lot of things in the mind of god he was speaking for god and now what a prophet does speaks instead of god we'll get into that when because satan wanted to be instead of but brother branham was telling us that in the mind of god you never were lost because remember the picture i told you that god took of you that's an eternal picture but see remember he didn't take a picture of everybody in the world i i don't think brother brown ever said that but he took a picture of a special group of people you say not polaroid no remember the mind of god's eternal glory that genesis 1 26 man developed and we had to come down here for those of you that don't know there used to be a negative when we took pictures you had to go right and the young people are going why snap sim card what are you talking about there used to be there used to be physical roles that you had to put in the camera you know they're coming back with those things now uh deanna's got a polaroid one of those insta a retro but it's you take a picture and the pictures pops out do they now still grief but that was all from back then though because you know kodak was just you had to you had to send all your film in with this i'm making a point here you had to send all your film in well god don't have to send film in god wants to had the first digitalization of pictures before man ever had it right he didn't need to go well i think sam that that's not sam dale what's going on what's that somebody who is that who's that no he had it all right there right in his infinite mind it just just popped up amen but remember because of the fall we had to come as a negative right and we could get older in that negative form but you can't get older in that positive form because when god took that picture remember brother brown says light has to strike the lens oh come on people genesis 1 26 it struck that lens and when it struck that lens that's you amen every child that god was going to have boom right there he was and he's got him in an album now you don't have to flip through no his album is right here this is god's album he doesn't need to look at the picture he didn't he doesn't need to go back into review right but we had to come to negative form though and we had to be go through a process we did that in school one time i still got some of the pictures stinking oh the the anybody ever done it stinks don't i mean the the chemicals you had to put together but you sloshed it you're going put paper and water yep you got to put that paper in the water and you got to slosh it and all of a sudden have you you've seen it what happens all of a sudden you start seeing a little bit of image then it gets clearer and clearer and you're sitting there doing it in that chemical and finally when you hold it up like this boom there's your picture well see that god had to wait he always had the picture but god had to wait till the day that you asked him to give you the baptism of the holy ghost and when he did he threw that negative in the trash can he took his eternal sd card stuck it in there and said that's what you look like now inside we're young again how'd i get off on that all right so anyway number three because look everything god's done the devil's made a substitute for it so god allowed satan to have this negative picture of us i'm going to stay on that for a minute because it's true this is a negative picture brother brown said brother brown said though it's got to be a positive though it's got to be a positive it's got to go to something you can't just pull a bunch of negatives up and say i can't make a picture of that no if you've got the negative you can make that picture you can develop that picture glory the problem with satan is is satan can't do that he can't say that's my subject and that's the way he's going to look for an eternity no they're going to all fall they're all going to die and they're all just going to vanish to me that's the worst thing to know than to be burning in hell even if you could burn for an eternity is to know that one day any purpose you had on this life i don't care if you the richest person in the world if you're not born again you're going to your name will evaporate from history think about that but if you're born again your name just begun down here right but it always was up there and it's going to something that's eternal so don't worry about the negative yeah those negative pictures i you know you keep taking these yearly pictures and you go my hair really gets that gray in a year god don't see that god's just waiting on the other end he said this is what i'm looking at and you know what that image came from that image came from the word that you are that image came from the word that you are that word that you are becoming brother brown said word upon word i hope it helps you sure it helps me gives me a positive look at everything a little more than we usually are number three i told a mama the other day i said this is the only period of time in our life that we like negatives one more time this is the only time during this corona virus that you don't want to be a positive you want to be negative because me and somebody was talking the other day and they kept saying positive i said you're you're you don't want to be positive in this aspect you want to be negative all right so we don't want we want to stay on the positive side look everything that god has done the devil's made a substitute for it made something bogus see that's the reason the two spirits in the last days come right along be formal and fun fundamental they miss the spirit altogether you see like that and some of these on the radical side go plumb off into isms with it but right in the middle of the road runs the true church of god standing in and full of the power of god that's where it's at right so you got your radicals over here signs and wonder seekers and all these different ones that wanna this this or whatever this is put it and then there's some over here that says why can't we be in the middle why can't we have it all amen have signs and wonders but have the pure unadulterated word of god amen why can't we have that and we do watch this right here this one is a good one this is demonology religious realm 1953. you know there's false there's a true and the faults of everything if i give you a dollar and i say this is a good dollar you'd look at it i'd have to look pretty much it have to look pretty much like a real dollar or you wouldn't believe it is that right so it'll have to be really a good imitation because if i get like a counterfeiter would you know i'd give you a twenty dollar bill and who's gonna tweet all about andrew jackson is it andrew jackson thank you brother louise you're the only one can afford 20 dollar bill i got lincoln's and you got benjamin franklin but no if i had no look but you you've all your life you've looked at this this certain bill 20 dollar bill and andrew jackson's head's been right here well if i hand you a 20 bill and say oh brother donny this is a good one and his head's upside down or george bush is on it see you know immediately that's not right but now true counterfeiters how many of them pass right now in our in our monetary system how many of them pass and they're almost 100 imitation you know what that means that means that satan is now almost 100 imitation because if i handed brother zach that money and and he takes and goes well this is this is false andrew jackson's upside down or george bush is on the front no you're gonna take it and go man this is exactly like the 20 bill in my pocket this is exactly watermark everything it's all good that's what we're facing today the two spirits are so close even being a counterfeit which makes it totally false because you know how much of a counterfeit bill is worth zero i don't care if it's got a hundred or a thousand or a million it's worth zero but the real one is worth the face value that's on that why because it's got something to back it up listen we've got something today to back up what we have not counterfeit we don't even have to worry if i give zach a word of god he says that ain't nothing but truth check it out though check it out though you think satan's going to say now hear something from me no he's going to be your brother i started to say he's going to be your daddy but hey bob all right it'll have to be a really good imitation and if jesus said the two spirits in the last days would be so close to it would deceive the very elective possible look religious people now remember now there ain't nothing i like that there ain't nothing out there in them old cold old cold formal outside they have just a form of godliness he's being pretty strict there in 1953. you see but these two spirits are real spirits they're real you say brother wait you just said one was fault it's a real false spirit you see but these two spirits are real spirits it'd be so close until they deceived the very elect how it was working side by side look in the last days did jesus say that he did all right let's look here i wrote myself a note to stop here for a minute because look there was not a requirement of full maturity in any age but this one because we're going to read a a pretty long quote here from the seed it's not there with shut where we go through and we've been through it many times before but i want you to look at it as the two spirits because because luther there was an antichrist spirit come up in luther's time but it was just two shoots so the antichrist spirit was twins so it was in baby farm okay and luther dealt with that but he allowed some of it to creep in jesus or or the the the light christ-like spirit never taught a water baptism in the name of father son holy ghost because it was anti-word but because it was in a baby form god allowed them to work together now you just don't have to believe me because i'm telling you martin luther was a trinitarian and people got born again under that trinitarian doctrine of that day not now of that day there was a bride that got birthed by one i'm going to say this one scripture the just shall live by faith they came out of that catholic church and they said god we're going to live by faith and we're going to start reading the bible because remember they took the bibles away we're going to start reading the bible we're going to start but they still baptized so see they were close and god couldn't pluck them up right because they look too close like i said the weed seed and there's one weed in my garden that looks just like and unbeknownst to me i pulled a few corn stalks up but when they were like this i put the hole to it and i cut it down because it looked like a weed but if i had to let it go on brothers that i'd have seen that stalk start making i said oh that's corn and that's not but see that's what god had to do we'll read this and watch as you see these two spirits moving up now remember we always go well that was the working of god and there was nothing but joy no satan was right in there working he was building his church he was building his doctrine but when it moved up to wesley he just moved right on up too oh sanctification i'll just the unclean spirit goes out here i just won't bring them back the same spirit that they had before because if i come back with the same spirit they're going to know who i am so i'm going to bring them another one right i'm going to bring them a religious one and then the pentecostals that was great the gifts without that coming of the gifts brother branham would have no platform to stand on right he would have no platform but since he was a part of that pentecostal movement and they believed in signs and wonders well my you know that was just but now what happened that platform stayed right here that platform stayed right there they had faith they were born again they got born again under the pentecostal message of 1906 in the different in azusa street right that wasn't false that was the holy ghost but what did the holy ghost fall on it fell on the word that they held it fell on the word that they knew and some of them were trinitarians god winked at their ignorance but really that but see you've got to really see though that satan was right there and god allowed that to happen because you know what god had told them when jesus christ was on earth he said leave them alone let them mature that's folks what me and you are facing today we're not facing baby demons we're not facing baby satan we're facing a full mature fixing to be an incarnate spirit in a man that's what we're facing now remember we don't see that when satan incarnates a man we don't see that we're gone remember all right but we do see the workings of it you see it right now and i want us to be that when we go back to the beginning we can see the characteristic and we can know what to expect you don't have to name names it's characteristic that we look at because i look at the corn and i see the tassel then all of a sudden here's an ear pops out on one side here's an ear pumps on the other side here's some silk how do i know that's corn i can't see the corn seed it's covered right right but it's in there working and by the characteristics i know that that's corn but what happens when it matures that's when you pull back the shuck and you can see the seed and you go aha it was corn all along but it now it's mature corn it's a maturity that and we preach maturity here but we've got to be able to stand on that maturity folks because that mature that mature antichrist spirit is standing here too a mature one not a baby one because god winked at the baby ignorance of them right he don't wink at our ignorance now no when the seals came open when the book came open all your everything had to go remember brother brown said it all ever from there all the way up to marriage and divorce he said i'm losing thousands of friends i'm only preaching in a trailer with 25 or 30 people this man packed hundreds of thousands of people but they were there for the fishes and the loaves they were not there for the meat of the word you and i listen they were not ready for it but you and i are ready for it you and i are ready for it because even brother branham's gonna say right here i'm gonna read this excuse me seed is not there with the show let's read this and i think we may just stop right here get out of here a little bit early and then i can give me something else to do for sunday seed is not air with a shot my brother dale just covered this so it shouldn't be it shouldn't be foreign to you remember there was no more seed promised through a woman anywhere after mary and there is no more denominations promised after pentecost so it really doesn't matter what come up but from pentecostal today all these worship centers and all these different uh what do they call them now they call them what community churches are they caught they're not even baptists of methodists anymore you know our our river of life 12 stone they have a name that they call but they're dead i'm sorry but they are dead seed is not air with a shuck watch and there is no more denominations promised after pentecost now see this is way i want to skip way ahead because we're going to go way back but this is the culmination of what happened way back in before time ever started watch it's the rapture and bride coming forth from there from what from the denominations the seed the word made manifest again notice see how close it looks matthew said saint matthew 24 24 said that the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people listen and the bride spirit of the bride people there's your two differences right let's don't name them let's don't name them but it's a spirit and they're covered under that spirit i'm telling you listen if we believe what brother brown said you got to believe that right there the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people would be so close together till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible that's how close look how it come through the stalk now notice we're going to type something here luther and the church age are bringing forth the bride's seed listen folks when the seed was planted it's bright seed this plant is bright even when even when he preached the restoration of the bride tree that wasn't bringing a new tree it was restoring the tree that had been eat the life had went down in the roots and then all of a sudden the s-o-n started shining and it brought what two shoots martin luther the just shall live by faith but did it stay there can't pull corn from that can't pull wheat from that can't get a mater or tater from it but you gotta let it white mature we've come this is mature time that's how close look how it was came from the stalk now notice we're going to type something here luther in the church age of bringing forth the bride seed was the same in spirit just one little grain of seed luther stood out on so that's no fault that's true seed got it luther was not false now the doctrine that came after luther is what was false if i got that say amen it wasn't luther that denominated no it was the people after that who has denominated the people this message brother branham no the people after the messengers already went off the scene luther stood out that was justification by faith he was the very type of hagar the stalk hagar oh my god yeah hagar the stalk anybody got that notice wesley was type of sarah the philadelphian the age of love that brought forth the tassel that was wesley right there all right i got it philadelphia age that was wesley now watch age of love that brought forth the tassel that was a wesley's age that was there was more missionaries than any other age we've had the great missionary age of john wesley's time what the seed was growing right but pentecost represented mary mary the last stage of it now she was not the seed marion herself was lost until she got the new birth even though she carried the seed of god inside of her the christ child she was lost until she got brother brown said she had to go to the upper room thank god the bible said mary was among the 120. the bible tells us that mary went to the upper room why she needed to go if she was the seed she had to become seed oh she was she was she she was seed from the yeah in god's mind she was seed from the beginning but she had to go through a process and had to go to the upper room to stream the holy ghost and she literally produced the christ child her body did right but didn't produce the life god produced the life same way with all of us god has to produce the life now watch but then where am i at pentecost represented mary mary the last stage of it now she was not the seed yet the life of the seed was in her but it hadn't matured yet the life of the seed was in pentecost it just had not matured they were babbling pentecostal babies they stayed where they was at they said well this is it we've got it this is the latter rain this is the last of it this is the outpouring of god the holy ghost but if you don't speak in tongues you ain't got it now see they come out of the bible from that they come out of the word of god when they said this is it if you don't speak in tongues you ain't got the holy ghost now that's what uh not what the bible says right all right so then what did god do cut them off and moved on right just like this right here watch i feel very religious it hadn't matured yet why why'd he say he felt religious he knew he was bringing the message of maturity and i don't say i i'm going to ask him this when i get on the other side but i know one thing's for sure i think he got tired of them pentecostal babies remember he the quran quote says everybody somebody's got a song somebody's got a word somebody you know you can't even preach because somebody jumps up and starts speaking in tongues and he had to put all that in order told one lady sit down and shut up quench the spirit no she was out of the word now it may have been god didn't anointed her i don't know but remember when he went into that service and one brother was speaking in tongues and another was interpreted brother branham by discernment knew that that was the right correct discernment but when he shook this one's hand and discerned this one spirit he had the baptism of the holy ghost went over here and shook hands with the other guy that did the interpreting and he was committing adultery living with another woman he said remember he went up to the cave and he said god something something ain't right i perceive that was the holy ghost that fell because see the so the so the anointing of the holy ghost fell on the good guy and the same anointing of the holy ghost fell on the bad guy look how close that is now in a congregation who would have caught it oh no that brother over there buddy he got the holy ghost because he interpreted that thing right down to the point then we had to have a prophet come on the scene and discern because he brought the word and the word was the discerner two-edged sword goes cut in cuts out he had to go in there and cut that thing i'm wondering if that guy ever sat in the service and listened to brother branham and brother brown didn't know he was in the service he probably was going why because he had been discerned and that's what the word does the word discerns and will discern the two spirits i'm gonna read that quote before we leave but let's get to this it was there but it didn't mature yet it was there but it wasn't mature so is it with our pentecostal age that we're living in there has got to come forth a word of god that's inner undenominational outside of the realms of that denomination luther went to husk with his first word the just shall live by faith wesley had two words sanctification now you say where's those two words clean and set aside for service that's what sanctification means all right he wasn't wrong when he said two words and he said sanctification second definite work of grace pentecost had the third word the restoration of the gifts but the entire seed has to come forth see how they denominated on one word and another word and another word but there's got to be look capital s something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life that's in there look the entirety of the life that's in there has to produce itself again on a bride there cannot be any more church ages after this we're at the end brothers and sisters we're here we've arrived that was in 1965. how far along are we now or should be we've arrived you know why he said we've arrived because when he come to that right there the seed is not there with a shuck he knew that right there was that separating time now he may not have knew that he was going to be had done passed off the scene a year from then but he knew his message was coming to an end and that the people was going to have to catch the message and take it on all right but there's got to be something that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life that's in there has to produce itself again on the bride there cannot be any more church ages after this we're at the end brothers and sisters we're here we've arrived thanks be to god amen now we see these things are just as true as they can be let's look let's do this right here god of this evil age i want you to look the two spirits one of them's god's holy spirit the other one the devil spirit working in deception the people of the earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ see this thing this antichrist is not hindering christ he's going to have his pic his kids i was thinking today you know the bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord and and i take for example um brother richards dad brother dale roberts i'm just going to say it people out in the world can die and god don't control that but if dale roberts is a born-again son of god which i believe he is he's got to fulfill a certain time it don't matter what men you do it don't matter what the doctors do it don't matter what anything that he has got a certain walk he's got to fulfill because he's part of god all these other people out here look and i said something the other day and i'm sorry i said it i said god don't care about anybody but the bride he cares about the whole world but he does not get any praise back from a certain group of people that he does from us and he wants what praise and worship he's god he's our creator that's how we're connected and those people can be just as connected but if he don't have that picture right if he don't see that you came to a day that you was tired of being tired like dave ramsey said being sick and tired of being sick and tired and you said god i'm not going any further until you fill me with the baptism of the holy ghost i can't go any further so as the footsteps of the righteous or order of the lord you can't go until god has solved the whole thing because you're his chip you're as children brother dale roberts is his children it doesn't matter they can pull everything in the world off they want to they can shoot him with poison it does not matter if he's an elective god this is just me he'll take care of you but he'll see that you've got to fulfill a certain section of what the mind of god saw before the foundation of the world you've got to fulfill that now you say well i'll just go out there and stand in the road he saw you do that he said stupid but you'll never go until you're fulfilled everything that god sees of that child that you are no way i just think about that today you can pull plugs whatever you want to do it doesn't matter but now see and you say oh you're being insensitive listen we're the children of god don't you take care of your children better than you take care of somebody else's kids especially the devils don't you take care of your kids well god almighty takes care of his kids it's not that he don't care about the world the world don't care about him and therefore they never had a picture they never had a scripture that they coincided with they never had a scripture that came from negative to positive because this this is the word of god [Music] this is where you got your positive picture your negative picture came from your mom and daddy but it's got to fit this word right here so you've got a certain journey to fulfill brother ron spencer should have died two months ago they gave him four months to live six months ago i said oh boy i don't care what they say until he fulfills his step of what he needs to fulfill they can and see if you'll see it that way if you and i'll start seeing it that way that's what's going to walk us into a body change natural healing is wonderful spiritual healing we've already got if you're born again but if you see like he sees then you will see yourself projected in a body change don't matter how long it takes that lady was 90 something years old that he saw on over on the curtain across the curtain of time 90 something years old she'd walk 90 something years without god but you know what and guardian angels was because he knew that child would call his name at 90 something years old and her steps oh she might have wasn't done all kind of things in the world but when she come to that 90-something years old god said time to become positive i'm going to take you from that negative because i saw you before the foundation of the world you got on your knees and you cried out to me at 90 something years old i don't care how old you are i don't care how much breath you got left get god and then it was your breath will never go away you say oh no i'm gonna draw my last breath praise god the next breath you draw will be eternal well if that don't make you excited aaron to tell you your spoon fell out you both don't stir your soul you say oh death that's why i said i'm gonna get a sermon one day on the power of death you say oh i got scripture where the bible says death has no dominion no it doesn't it's a vehicle it's a vehicle to get you somewhere jesus had to die to give us eternal life something's got to die for you to eat we sometimes look at it the wrong way spirit of god oh if the faint look the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age what through the prophet's message not a false folks there's got to be a truth here if this ain't it i just really don't think there is anything besides this because this is helping all of us get to a place and it's a positive place not the negative place if the finger look if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move see how specific he is about the age that's what i said about people living their life you're here in the right time at the right place at the right moment at the right 11th hour if the eye is to see in this age the eye will see oh come on people the spirit of god as it growed into the full stature of god is the age that we're now living in the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour the message of the hour it's not a message it's the message of the hour and the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called out of this chaos the devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by error as usual by perversion of the word of god now listen he's not going back in and he's not took this and said well they're all prostitutes drug addicts perverts no they're church people right i'm sorry it's the church system but if you connect yourself to the system you become part of the system all right as usual by perversion of what not of their flesh by the perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning see it coming right back to that seed time again from eden here it is again here it is again bear with me for about one second all right exposition of the seven church ages this is the quote i wanna i want you to get this in your mind and then we'll musicians come when i get finished with this because watch i'll get right here when me and bro zach can be together now remember this everybody believe brother brown was a prophet you believe he brought us the word of god all right well i'm fixing to tell you what he's saying now remember this christ in the true church not the false church is a continuation of the book of acts what fell in the book of acts the holy ghost but the book of revelation shows that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works now what's in parentheses attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word now don't put nobody's name in there don't put no church in there but you see what they're doing they're not saying the word of god's wrong they're not saying brother adam was wrong they're twisting it one word off you can fill the church up with one word off right down to the time watch he fights it watch right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it but when you get the devil mad that's anger from way back more than your mama and your daddy ever got angry with you he cannot stand it he knows that if the people see the people have been going through the different ages and just been lulled to sleep and they've all died this age someone has got to come to the full revelation so they can't die and if satan knows that watch he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is not going to be what she stands for what the word and that she can do the greater works remember more of it because it's scattered all over the country not greater than jesus but more of it she will be an invincible army right if they get a true revelation of the two spirits that's where i got my sermon from they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the message christian church it says christian church didn't it and by god's spirit and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely toward thwarted today as when christ withstood his ever effort now why did christ withstand the devil by word of god that's all he didn't say devil you can't talk anymore no he just let him right along he said it is written you know in other words he's saying i wrote it i i wrote what i'm fixing to say to you so i know what's going to happen so why can't we have confidence with that to know that what god's wrote of us that we can just use it back to the devil all right yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us now remember they're going to come but there's already a standard there the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them let's stand our feet if you have a chance before sunday read jude read the whole chapter of jude and watch the bible talks about ungodly men certain men not saints crept in unaware ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god you say oh we got we gotta look when all this comes it's gonna be some evil person that's gonna bear be careful it's going to be some slicker it's going to be somebody coming in rubbing your back going have you ever thought about um you know i believe that's what he did eve he said eve you know i was i kind of heard there in the garden that you're supposed to you're supposed to multiply what's your problem you got everything you need your husband bless his heart he he may he probably just don't know i i'll i'll go ahead and tell you what's going on see that's what we're going to talk about when we get in the garden of eden we're going to get down to where i believe brother branham if moses could stand there and write it he was looking at it television he was watching what happened in the garden i believe that god through the prophet bringing this revelation that's what he does we love revelation satan hates it we love revelation by revelation we can get a television view of all that that's went on right and that we can bring it right here and that we can tell each one of us be careful because this time is going to be the most deceiving time ever on the face of the earth ever not even luther not wesley not not right here but i promise you folks there's a rock there's a rock mountain that will not be moved satan's going to try to do everything he can but he cannot move the bride of jesus christ let's sing a song god bless you only two spirits so don't worry about all
