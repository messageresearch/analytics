[3:13] through he keeps us when we're asleep he
[3:15] keeps us our breathing our
[3:18] heartbeat he's the god of our life amen
[3:22] um I was reminded this morning um years
[3:26] ago I put this together actually for
[3:28] brother Joe that that uh goes to the
[3:30] nursing home with a Ministry there it's
[3:32] a list for uh scriptures for healing and
[3:36] so what I did it was on my heart many
[3:37] years ago just to go through the
[3:39] scriptures and find those scriptures
[3:42] that pertain to our healing that we can
[3:44] take back to God and I know there's a
[3:46] lot of sicknesses that are going around
[3:48] and so I printed out a lot of copies in
[3:50] the back if you want to take one um at
[3:53] the bottom brother bam says in the
[3:56] sermon God has provided a way he said
[3:58] God has to to keep his word God doesn't
[4:01] have to heal to prove his power but he
[4:05] has to heal to keep his word that's
[4:08] right God doesn't have to prove anything
[4:12] he's God but what he speaks he's
[4:14] obligated to his word so I want to
[4:17] encourage you um you know we call out
[4:20] the names and and the ones that are
[4:22] going through you know a need but take
[4:25] his word back to him go through here
[4:27] pick a promise and keep reminding him of
[4:30] his word he'll come to that word and
[4:32] make it alive in your own body and
[4:34] you'll see the healing manifest so um

[20:35] prayer so father I pray that you'd be
[20:37] with us and bless us now in Jesus name
[20:40] amen John 1 verse one in the beginning
[20:42] was the word the word was with God and
[20:44] the Word was God the same was in the
[20:47] beginning with God as we were talking
[20:48] about Wednesday night we'll background a
[20:51] little bit on that all things were made
[20:53] by
[20:54] him whoever this person is now we're
[20:56] talking about man' whoever this person
[20:57] is
[20:58] he's he has made everything all right he
[21:02] even made the devil but he didn't make
[21:04] the devil the devil that's right he made
[21:05] him lufer he made him the anointed
[21:08] cherub and then the Cherub made a choice
[21:11] all things were made by him and without
[21:13] him was not anything made that was made
[21:14] then verse 14 God thought so much of
[21:17] that word he put it down in flesh and
[21:20] that word was made flesh and dwelt among
[21:22] us and we beheld his glory the glory of
[21:23] the only begotten of the father full of
[21:25] grace and truth you can be seated in the
[21:26] Lord has his Blessing to the reading of
[21:27] the word Colossians 1:12 says we were um
[21:32] if you weren't here W tonight we'll give
[21:33] you a little bit of a background here uh
[21:36] we were covering something because if we
[21:39] see
[21:41] that it's a paradox we must see that
[21:44] we're called out of the age that our
[21:45] that our soul is in Heavenly places as
[21:47] we were talking about in another
[21:49] dimension because it's Eternal and but
[21:51] it's it's caught or encapsulated in in
[21:55] this body that we're living in it
[21:56] doesn't migrate or it doesn't move move
[21:58] or it doesn't I breathe my soul out into
[22:00] brother Michael and he breathes his back
[22:01] to me no you're an individual and a
[22:03] person and we'll get to that God thought
[22:05] so much of that he made it so
[22:07] individual he made it so individual that
[22:10] you are you're everything you do you're
[22:13] an individual all right and as we're
[22:16] going to read here before you can't
[22:17] blame it on your mama your daddy your
[22:18] brother your sister you are going to
[22:20] stand before the white drone judgment if
[22:22] you do not have the baptism of the Holy
[22:24] Ghost in your soul you will stand there
[22:26] by yourself not as a family
[22:28] right all right and you can't stand
[22:30] there and say well my daddy made it so
[22:32] why didn't I no your daddy made it
[22:34] because and you didn't make it because
[22:36] so you can fill all that in all right so
[22:39] we got to have our own personal
[22:40] experience with God that's right
[22:42] everybody with me on that you got to
[22:44] have that and you got to have the same
[22:45] thing with these virtues these virtues
[22:47] don't cover
[22:49] families
[22:51] right no
[22:53] individuals always an
[22:56] individual giving thanks unto the Father
[22:59] which has made us meat to be partakers
[23:00] of the inheritance of the Saints and
[23:02] Light Watch how Paul articulates this
[23:05] who hath delivered us from the power of
[23:07] Darkness all right he's took us from
[23:08] somewhere and ha translated us into the
[23:11] kingdom of his dear son now what's
[23:14] translate that's transpose or transfer
[23:16] or remove from one place to another
[23:18] we've been removed from the supposed to
[23:21] power of evil amen that's in our soul
[23:24] and we are but we still have a spirit to
[23:27] deal with all right it has not been
[23:30] translated it was something we got when
[23:32] we got here it was a nature that we have
[23:34] to fight but if you're born again today
[23:37] you have been translated into the
[23:38] kingdom and you got a place in the city
[23:41] City's already being built and it's
[23:43] being built in you all right we'll get
[23:45] to that maybe a little bit this
[23:46] afternoon where John saw the city and it
[23:48] looked like a bride the bride looked
[23:50] like a city but he's translated us into
[23:53] the kingdom of his dear son to transpose
[23:55] transfer or move from one place to
[23:57] another change of situation or place in
[24:00] whom we have Redemption through his
[24:02] blood even the Forgiveness of sins now
[24:04] look who is the image of the invisible
[24:06] God the firstborn of every creature now
[24:09] we were talking before and we're going
[24:11] to read it again where in this age is
[24:14] the beginning of the creation of God
[24:16] it's when the son of man is to be
[24:18] revealed so much to where we look back
[24:20] and see that the real you didn't do it
[24:25] amen all right remember justification
[24:27] ification baptism the Holy Ghost and
[24:29] brother Brown s justification you did it
[24:31] but you've been
[24:33] forgiven it's as if you never done it
[24:36] right and then you're going to realize
[24:37] the real you didn't do it to begin with
[24:39] all right and quit holding on to all
[24:40] this baggage from the Past come on
[24:44] somebody that's our problem the baggage
[24:47] from the
[24:48] past and it bothers us but we should not
[24:51] let it bother us we should cast what the
[24:54] Bible says cast down
[24:55] reasoning cast down all that get rid of
[24:58] our emotion that that well well I I I I
[25:01] I I got these feelings about this and
[25:03] feeling God didn't ask you did you feel
[25:05] it he said did you believe it all right
[25:09] he never said anything about feelings
[25:11] what about a son of man you're talking
[25:12] about somebody that he's a prince of
[25:14] peace and and the great uh everybody
[25:17] goes well Jesus is so loving and caring
[25:19] and and I just want to be that way well
[25:21] guess what he did they killed him for
[25:23] what he said right and it was the
[25:26] absolute truth yes sir it wasn't a lie
[25:30] it was a truth that's what they killed
[25:31] him for so guess what same way they'll
[25:33] do me and you they'll kill us or kill
[25:35] our influence one of the two so who is
[25:37] the image of the invisible God the
[25:39] firstborn of every creature now he's the
[25:41] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[25:43] of every creature so somewhere we're
[25:44] going to see this image of this God
[25:47] unfold and remember you're going to see
[25:49] where God says You' never seen me at any
[25:52] time but the the son has declared the
[25:55] father all right just like we were
[25:56] reading there all right for by him were
[25:58] all things created that heaven Earth
[26:00] visible invisible Thrones dominions
[26:03] principalities all things were created
[26:05] by Him before him and he is before all
[26:06] things now watch how Paul Paul is
[26:08] bringing this from Heaven to Earth yes
[26:13] and he is before all things and before
[26:16] him all thing and by him all things
[26:19] consist and he's the head of the body
[26:21] the church is not in heaven the church
[26:24] is here and he is the head of the body
[26:26] of the church who was the beginning the
[26:28] firstborn from the dead that in all
[26:31] things he might have the preeminence for
[26:32] it pleased the father that in him should
[26:35] all fullness dwell now see you can't say
[26:37] that about Adam Adam was not born he
[26:41] wasn't born again he didn't have a
[26:43] choice God gave him eternal life because
[26:46] he was the first man he was going to be
[26:48] the first example of man on Earth that
[26:51] was going to live and be Eternal but we
[26:54] know what happened he sold us out and
[26:56] then God had to take all that away from
[26:58] him amen he took all that away from Adam
[27:01] didn't take eternal life away from him
[27:03] but he took him the ability for him to
[27:05] live eternally in his body so then Adam
[27:08] 900 years later he had to die all right
[27:11] sin curse finally got him after 900
[27:13] years Genesis 2:7 said the Lord God
[27:16] formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground
[27:18] and breathed through his nostrils the
[27:19] breath of life and Man became a living
[27:21] soul and we were talking about this in
[27:23] the Bible study and and some on
[27:25] Wednesday night let's just remember for
[27:27] one thing I brother Brown I'm going
[27:29] prove it and brother Dale has preached
[27:30] it many many years that Adam was Adam
[27:32] was formed Out of the Dust of the ground
[27:34] his body was but remember his soul was
[27:37] that theophany that that was Genesis 1
[27:40] 126 that could rule and Reign and and
[27:43] you know uh the the wind would move and
[27:45] he'd say stop or this mountain would
[27:47] move and he'd say all right I need it
[27:48] over that way he was the architect of
[27:50] the
[27:51] Earth in his Spirit form right amen all
[27:55] right but when he put that into the two
[27:57] seven man God gave him a breath of life
[28:01] just like a baby born now we proved that
[28:05] the other day he didn't come here with
[28:07] eternal life in him there's only one
[28:08] person that did that and that was Jesus
[28:11] Christ when that baby breathed on
[28:14] whatever it was it wasn't Christmas day
[28:15] but in in April sometime when Jesus was
[28:17] born that was the Breath of God all
[28:21] right you and I are born by the Breath
[28:22] of God after the new birth but we're
[28:24] born by just regular natural breath that
[28:27] God gives us when we're born here
[28:29] naturally into this world everybody with
[28:31] me then Jesus said to them peace be unto
[28:34] you as my father has sent me even so I
[28:36] send you and when he had said this he
[28:38] breathed on them and said unto them
[28:39] receive ye the Holy Ghost now remember
[28:42] he did not they did not receive it at
[28:44] that moment right that was a promise the
[28:46] prophet of God tells us I didn't read
[28:48] the quote save time brother Brown said
[28:49] that was a promise and it was a promise
[28:51] cuz where was the Holy Ghost at that
[28:53] time it was sealed up inside of that man
[28:56] called Jesus Christ that's right all
[28:58] right and being sealed up inside of that
[29:00] man Jesus Christ until he left because
[29:03] he promised him he said I'll come
[29:06] back which is the Holy Ghost which is
[29:09] the comforter which is me I'm going to
[29:11] send back and he did that on the
[29:13] Pentecost so they couldn't receive it
[29:14] right then because Jesus had not left to
[29:16] send it back because in other words if
[29:18] he has breathed on them and he'd been
[29:20] standing on the earth and then his body
[29:22] his church body had started right then
[29:24] they'd have two bodies on the earth at
[29:26] the same time right everybody with me
[29:28] don't get
[29:29] quiet so Jesus had to go away it's
[29:32] expedient that I go away so that I can
[29:36] build a body down
[29:38] here Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone
[29:40] that's what we're heading to
[29:42] am that's what the seals are going to do
[29:44] it's going to head us toward the our
[29:46] body
[29:47] change where no one else has been able
[29:49] to do that and it's not just going to be
[29:52] a happening it's not just going to be a
[29:53] day on the calendar it's not just going
[29:54] to be something that uh that God just
[29:57] cocked it up one day and said I'm tired
[29:58] of this we just going to have a a day
[30:00] right here in on November the 24th of
[30:03] 2024 I'm going to change everybody's
[30:05] body no that's not the way it
[30:08] is you're being changed right
[30:11] now you're being changed right now if
[30:14] you're not being changed right now if
[30:15] you're not changed from what you were
[30:17] you need the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy
[30:19] Ghost will change you whosoever sins you
[30:22] remit they are remitted and whosoever
[30:24] sins you retain they are retained see I
[30:26] want Power you you get when you receive
[30:28] the Holy Ghost all
[30:30] right Blasphemous names brother Brown
[30:32] talks about the church is a mystical
[30:34] Body of Christ born of the Breath of God
[30:37] now not as the baby you got to take the
[30:39] baby out because they were already on
[30:41] the day of Pentecost they probably were
[30:43] in their what 20s 30s 40s some of them
[30:45] in their 50 year old they've been
[30:47] breathing natural breath for a long time
[30:50] but all of a sudden God breathes into
[30:52] them especially into them just like
[30:54] especially into Adam he breathed the
[30:56] breath of eternal life life and they
[30:57] became an eternal person with God
[31:00] yes now that's what happened to
[31:03] you if you're born again God breathed
[31:05] the breath of eternal life not regular
[31:07] breath eternal life into you and you
[31:10] became a living Soul yes cuz we were
[31:13] dead before right the Bible tells us
[31:15] many many times we were dead in TR
[31:16] trespassing sin we were brother we were
[31:19] on our way to hell we were on our way
[31:21] down now we turn around we're on our way
[31:23] up so born of the Breath of God oh did
[31:26] you get that the Church of God is
[31:29] born of the Breath of God God breathed
[31:32] breath into the nostrils look
[31:34] spiritually of Adam not
[31:37] natural Adam was already breathing
[31:39] natural that's why he separated that
[31:41] we'll see in a minute where he says not
[31:42] what nature gave
[31:43] you nature gives you breath listen when
[31:46] a when a dog is
[31:48] born God don't give him a soul but he
[31:50] sure gives him breath and he breathes
[31:52] all through his life that's right right
[31:56] so they're a living being but they're
[31:57] not a living
[31:58] individual being they're born of
[32:02] nature right we know
[32:06] that but spiritually he breathed the
[32:09] Breath of Life spiritually of Adam and
[32:11] he became a living
[32:13] Soul there's many there's a Doctrine one
[32:15] time a long time ago brother Dale was
[32:17] telling us about it
[32:18] that that without the new
[32:21] birth you're not a living Soul no you're
[32:24] a living Soul when you're
[32:25] born no now it says here become a living
[32:28] so what do that mean that means that you
[32:30] were what the Bible says you're dead
[32:32] while you're living you can breathe
[32:34] really good natural good breath and be
[32:37] dead as a
[32:38] hammer dead in trespassing sin dead to
[32:42] to God but when you become what
[32:46] spiritually breathed upon and
[32:48] spiritually you become a son and
[32:50] daughter of God yes what does that do
[32:53] you become a living Soul your soul is
[32:55] then Eternal right right has new
[32:58] thoughts new
[32:59] process said did you know the
[33:01] Pentecostals of the true Pentecostal
[33:03] church is born of the Breath of God now
[33:05] what is
[33:06] that I hope my battery's not running low
[33:09] I thought I plugged it
[33:10] in I'll plug it in in a minute if I have
[33:13] to now so let's look and see what that
[33:16] breath is the brother brandom talks
[33:17] about logos and I just found a
[33:19] definition online and it's the same
[33:21] things what he says it's it's when you
[33:23] start speaking it's the speech it's the
[33:25] Talking part all right because we
[33:28] couldn't understand God how can we
[33:30] understand somebody again that that we
[33:32] never
[33:33] saw he had no place to put himself
[33:36] that's right right till he started
[33:38] creating well it was all formulated in
[33:41] his mind from the beginning to the end
[33:43] yes sir amen from the beginning to the
[33:45] end it was all now how you going to
[33:47] understand that guy you can't but the
[33:51] part we need to understand is all that
[33:53] Redemptive blessing that we're in under
[33:56] now that's what we need to understand
[33:58] about God because listen there'll be
[34:00] more for us to understand about God when
[34:01] we get there amen and there's more for
[34:04] us to understand now till we get there
[34:07] all right so we did not get it all at
[34:08] one time but God's got it all yes sir
[34:11] but how you going to understand that
[34:13] person that logos or that logic or that
[34:16] logo how you going to figure that out
[34:18] he's got to step forward and start
[34:20] talking as we said Wednesday night you
[34:23] can get a good sermon you can have a
[34:24] good testimony and you can walk up here
[34:27] and not say a word for 45 minutes and
[34:29] you got it up here brother John it's
[34:32] formulating that sermon is formulating
[34:34] in your head but until you speak it
[34:37] until you logos until you let it out
[34:40] amen it does nobody good so it wasn't
[34:42] going to do anybody any good for God to
[34:45] just stand there by himself because he
[34:46] had attributes he had feelings emotions
[34:49] yes God did amen and he had a a mouth he
[34:52] had
[34:53] speech and remember when he speaks he
[34:56] can't say
[34:57] I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that
[35:01] no now that we can't comprehend cuz how
[35:05] many times have we even this morning
[35:07] thought of something like I no I don't
[35:09] think I don't want to do that or not I
[35:11] don't think I want to do that so so this
[35:14] logos is brother BR I'm going to explain
[35:15] here in just a minute it look it's
[35:18] logical connection between an idea now
[35:20] look it includes faction statistics to
[35:22] me the faction statistics that did go
[35:24] that did go out the faction sta iscs
[35:27] that we are under is your Bible that you
[35:29] got in your
[35:32] hand that's a fact and it gives you
[35:35] statistics how that David slew
[35:44] Goliath boo
[35:46] devil I had this thing plugged in anyway
[35:50] so we can start with it
[35:53] anyway we get it started all right so we
[35:56] have a we have a place though that where
[35:58] God can we can understand that even a
[36:01] man that can that didn't exist didn't
[36:03] need anything to exist
[36:05] by is
[36:06] there so then that person that person
[36:10] then by the logos you have to have
[36:13] something to look at so there was a
[36:15] theophany that was made that Genesis 126
[36:18] man was a theophany of
[36:22] God
[36:25] right because theophany is two words
[36:28] theophan which is God being manifested
[36:31] or the manif visible manifestation of a
[36:34] deity that's why talking when brother
[36:37] Aaron was talking about us coming
[36:38] together I mean look I if you get around
[36:42] bride that's the manifestation of
[36:45] deity but that world out there is not
[36:48] the manifestation of
[36:50] deity now it might have a deity but it's
[36:52] the deity of the devil not the deity of
[36:55] God Amen something they worship out
[36:57] there so we know where God is and we
[37:01] know God has given us a soul which is
[37:03] our theophan is brother R says cuz it's
[37:06] there with us that's what's going to be
[37:08] judged you your soul
[37:12] you but God had to become a theophany
[37:14] first so he could stand down and say Let
[37:16] There Be and then during the Old
[37:17] Testament he could walk in the cool of
[37:19] the day and talk to Adam so he had a
[37:21] body had a mouth ears and all the
[37:23] different things Parts because that's
[37:25] what Adam had that's right and we were
[37:27] made in His image all
[37:32] right and the commentator said ites it
[37:35] doesn't it doesn't show up in scripture
[37:37] but we by the Revelation that we have
[37:40] even of the end time we can look back
[37:42] and see that how God appeared as the
[37:44] angel of the Covenant he appeared as the
[37:47] captain of the host he appeared to Moses
[37:50] as we'll read it here in a few minutes
[37:51] he appeared to
[37:53] Abraham in theophany with a body of
[37:56] around it but that wasn't Jesus that was
[37:58] prefigure Jesus that was the theophany
[38:01] of God which was Jesus when he got a
[38:04] body down here all right there by with
[38:06] me why did Jesus need a body cuz you got
[38:08] one I was talking to brother Isaac
[38:11] yesterday or yeah last night he was
[38:13] talking about change of the body I said
[38:15] well that's where the seals has got to
[38:17] the seals has to show us the seals has
[38:19] to break we'll see where brother R tells
[38:21] us without the seals being broke you're
[38:23] not going to understand full Redemption
[38:25] that's right cuz the Seal of full
[38:27] Redemption not the twi horse rider was
[38:28] the Antichrist that is a revelation and
[38:31] that does get you started but it says
[38:33] brother Donaldo said Matthew 24:24
[38:36] there's them two
[38:37] Spirits that's what you and I got
[38:39] discern and remember it was in in
[38:41] brother brandom and he said there it
[38:47] goes oh that's hard for people to get
[38:51] but he said here stands the Lamb with a
[38:52] book in his hand there goes a wild hor
[38:53] Rider if you read back and we'll get
[38:55] into it later on on uh in the maybe next
[38:58] week brother rown says I made a horrible
[39:00] mistake so what mistake was God going to
[39:03] make one come on was God going to make a
[39:06] mistake was God going to make his word
[39:09] wrong but brother renom did read the
[39:12] mighty conqueror 1959 he reads
[39:14] Revelation 6 and calls that the white
[39:18] horse rider with a man standing on
[39:19] sitting on it it's
[39:23] Christ but not when the Seal's broke
[39:26] that's right when the seals broke it
[39:27] tore apart and divided that Matthew
[39:30] 24:24 and we'll read it later on with
[39:32] the two Spirits what did Jesus stand up
[39:35] and say beware of
[39:38] false Devils no he didn't say that he
[39:42] said Beware of false
[39:45] Christ Christ's anointed
[39:49] ones separate them brother B says even
[39:52] in the church age book we'll read it
[39:53] later on where brother Bown says he said
[39:55] when we get a true revelation of the two
[39:57] spirits in the framework of this
[40:02] church I pointed to me and
[40:06] you like someone was speaking the other
[40:08] day said God what was he when he was
[40:11] back under millions and millions of
[40:12] years ago he was just like this space
[40:14] and then he gathered it up into the lost
[40:16] where we can understand he's going to
[40:17] talk then he came from the Lost down
[40:19] into Christ which is the anointed one or
[40:21] the Lo or the theophany it's God coming
[40:24] down like this to the Earth and then
[40:25] going right back in to God again don't
[40:27] you see what I mean just revolving
[40:29] coming down from space eternity rolling
[40:32] together coming down to Loos logos down
[40:34] of the man then return right back again
[40:36] for one purpose what to redeem that man
[40:38] that had fallen so he did all this for
[40:41] me and you now that's what he came for
[40:43] to be a redeemer and before God could be
[40:45] a redeemer he had to be according to the
[40:47] law K to us so he had to be born a baby
[40:51] cuz that's what me and you are we're
[40:52] born a baby right all right now there's
[40:56] different things you're talking about
[40:57] brother Bown now he says but God put a
[40:59] soul into man I want us to understand
[41:01] this that soul is the most important
[41:05] thing we can groom
[41:07] it lose
[41:09] it dress
[41:12] it and your soul be just as black
[41:15] absolutely amen as
[41:21] night but God put a soul in a man now
[41:24] watch this this white cloud deity came
[41:27] down not in the animal in the man all
[41:31] right he's talking about
[41:33] Adam cuz then here's this man and now
[41:37] the man sinned all right now look Adam
[41:41] didn't sin in his
[41:42] soul he s in his
[41:46] Spirit if you're born again today you
[41:49] have Sins Not in your soul but in your
[41:52] spirit everybody with me see how Adam
[41:54] and us it's got to be the same EX except
[41:56] you couldn't take Adam as your Redeemer
[41:58] because he's not kfol to you in the
[42:01] listen in the evolution I say create not
[42:04] Creative Evolution but God's Evolution
[42:07] Adam was the first man but like we said
[42:09] before you can uh you can go back and
[42:12] search all you want to we came from
[42:14] three
[42:16] people ham sham or jath we come from one
[42:19] of them three cuz no one never had
[42:20] another kid we came from them three and
[42:23] the whole world was populated for three
[42:24] men and three women the ones that were
[42:26] married to okay so we all came from that
[42:28] and it was all mixed up and gomed up and
[42:31] and there's no way you can find your
[42:33] true origin except I just put my faith
[42:36] in God that he knew where I was at
[42:40] before I got here right and he knows
[42:42] where I'm going after I get here and he
[42:46] made a place for me to go
[42:48] to you ought to be satisfied with that
[42:52] man does not know where they're going
[42:53] now got an election coming up got this
[42:55] one over here we got Trump and we got
[42:58] this one and we got that one and we
[42:59] they're already calling him the
[43:00] Antichrist and they just don't know what
[43:02] the Antichrist is that's right they're
[43:04] living in that system now yes
[43:07] sir the Antichrist system is Antichrist
[43:12] yes so it's a father son Holy Ghost
[43:14] baptism Christ no it's
[43:18] Antichrist that's why brother R had to
[43:20] come back that's why the word had to
[43:22] come back into Power where God could use
[43:24] us again cuz things in the word
[43:27] is that man tore the pages
[43:30] out oh we don't have to do
[43:33] that our denomination says this n said
[43:37] we're going to do this the nickolath and
[43:40] spirit which that's what we're going to
[43:41] cover in the church ages you're going to
[43:43] see you're going to see that God now now
[43:45] listen God now we look at him we see
[43:48] where brother BR he he goes back and he
[43:50] says here stands the lamb and there goes
[43:52] he see separation yes right all of it
[43:55] separating yes all right well now what
[43:57] he's saiding is is down when they got
[43:59] NAA they were going to try to join it
[44:00] all back together or join it together to
[44:05] them you go talk to a real good Baptist
[44:08] Methodist and you go through all their
[44:10] major doctrines right it's the same as
[44:13] the Catholic Church except for
[44:16] communion and brother brandham said that
[44:19] somewhere they'll compromise on that to
[44:21] get into that World Council of churches
[44:23] they're uniting oh yeah they're
[44:28] uniting we are too but we're United time
[44:31] and sign to the bride to our what to our
[44:34] husband now they have a husband
[44:38] too and when he ascended and fell let's
[44:40] get back to Adam then that little cloud
[44:43] in there now look God didn't do away
[44:45] with a little
[44:48] Cloud right it just became marred in
[44:52] Black the flu got stopped up Adam
[44:55] started using in something he never had
[44:57] before and that was a carnal
[44:59] mind that would allow him to lust
[45:03] come we might get to it today we may not
[45:06] we'll get to it this afternoon for sure
[45:08] brother R talks about babies and why
[45:10] they all go to heaven when they're
[45:16] young cuz they have no sin I'll read it
[45:19] to you he said they have no sin he said
[45:22] you can't have
[45:23] sin and go to heaven right he said but
[45:27] one time when a person comes or a kid or
[45:30] whoever you are comes to the age of
[45:32] accountability to know that's wrong
[45:34] watch
[45:35] out then you become
[45:38] accountable then you become brother R
[45:40] talks about recording Angels recording
[45:44] what you done but before that look at
[45:46] how innocent you're born in you think
[45:48] well that baby was born from from um a
[45:50] prostitute and and um you know whatever
[45:53] more well it doesn't matter right okay
[45:56] hang out on your mom and
[45:58] daddy you and God same way with Adam he
[46:02] didn't get he he gave adam a choice he
[46:04] said you eat this you'll be fine you
[46:05] don't eat this you're not going to be
[46:06] you not be good I'm not going to be
[46:08] happy and you're not going to be happy
[46:11] but that little cloud in there became
[46:12] marred in Black then the logos came down
[46:15] now that's we're talking about Jesus
[46:17] Christ now and was made flesh and dwelt
[46:19] among us to redeem this man back to the
[46:21] love of the
[46:23] father and he came in by the baptism of
[46:25] the Holy Spirit and Chase sin out of the
[46:27] human praise God and brings man back
[46:30] again again in fellowship with
[46:35] God we would see Jesus in the beginning
[46:38] God was the spirit all The Fountains of
[46:40] goodness and mercy and power love God
[46:42] was the center of that Fountain and then
[46:44] the logos that went out of God in the be
[46:46] beginning became what we call a
[46:48] theophany in other words a supernatural
[46:50] body God is just not like the air he's
[46:53] in a body praise God Amen
[46:56] our God is so much different than what
[46:59] people analyze him to be in this
[47:02] world everywhere you see God he's a Doty
[47:05] old
[47:06] Granddaddy and he's walking around with
[47:08] ballal head ballal head no
[47:11] hair and whatever he's got is gray and a
[47:14] beard stooped over well that ain't God
[47:17] cuz you know why they go back to Daniel
[47:18] where it says the Ancient of Days well
[47:20] listen if you're
[47:22] Eternal You' be the Ancient of Days and
[47:25] look like a 18y old
[47:27] kid and that's what God did cuz he can't
[47:31] change and he didn't change when he came
[47:34] down here he just took on a flesh body
[47:37] and changed it back that's what he's
[47:39] going to do to me and
[47:40] you so Moses seen him pass and said he
[47:43] look like the back part of a man and so
[47:45] forth and then that same theophany was
[47:47] made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld
[47:49] him the only begotten of the father
[47:51] Christ you I was looking online uh just
[47:53] seeing what people thought about MDC you
[47:55] know out in the world and and different
[47:57] things and they they have no clue
[47:58] they're fighting over if it's just a it
[48:00] was just a a a dream that Abraham had
[48:03] and and it was a a priesthood so it was
[48:06] a bunch of people uh it wasn't just this
[48:09] one person and how can this one person
[48:11] talk to Adam I mean talk to Abraham and
[48:13] be without father and mother how can he
[48:15] do this and how can he do that how can
[48:17] that well it's
[48:20] God God veiled in human
[48:23] flesh good Lord
[48:26] see how they don't understand God can do
[48:29] whatever he wants to
[48:31] do cuz he's God but he can't do any more
[48:35] than what his word
[48:36] says John 1 says 18 says no man has seen
[48:40] God at any time the only begotten son
[48:42] which is in the bosom of the father hath
[48:44] declared him as brother Brown says many
[48:46] times he said you don't see the real
[48:47] William brandham right here he said you
[48:49] see the shell that I
[48:51] inhabit cuz I believe today by the
[48:54] baptism of the the Holy Ghost your soul
[48:57] is not the age of your person
[49:02] outside how could your soul feel like
[49:04] you feel outside and be Eternal somebody
[49:07] talk to me and tell me
[49:09] that amen I'll be 64 coming up I got
[49:12] this ache in my arm that I ain't never
[49:13] had
[49:14] before I didn't even know I had a muscle
[49:19] there somebody was laughing the other
[49:21] day heard my one of the sermons I was
[49:23] talking about you know kids they just
[49:24] jump up out the bed and then I have to
[49:26] just say all right come on
[49:29] feet my hands get numb now cuz I put
[49:32] them over my head my yours too soon put
[49:36] see what I mean she's old I put um she's
[49:39] older than me you put your hand over
[49:41] here and then you get up in the morning
[49:42] you
[49:45] go and you do that you spend the rest of
[49:47] your waking mon morning doing this cuz
[49:50] you sure don't want to grab something
[49:52] with it cuz you don't know you got in
[49:53] your hand okay Michael's going yeah
[49:56] right sure sure you just wait I hope you
[50:00] don't see my age cuz you'd be doing my
[50:05] funeral so how do we declare God we
[50:08] declare God just the way Jesus did by
[50:12] his
[50:13] works by who he was he didn't look like
[50:15] God hold on a minute he was 50 something
[50:18] 30 something years old now remember
[50:20] God's a kid God's 18 years old he ain't
[50:22] never been old but he was unveiled in
[50:25] that flesh that came onto the Earth
[50:27] through the womb of a woman came into
[50:29] Satan's domain and right then his body
[50:33] began to began to
[50:36] deteriorate that's a paradox but inside
[50:38] of him his soul never got any older or
[50:41] younger than It Ever Was same thing with
[50:44] me and you that's swive by the baptism
[50:45] of the Holy Ghost I can see that my soul
[50:48] yes is 18 years old it's that image
[50:53] where' God get that image at he took a
[50:56] picture of you as brother R said way
[50:57] before the foundation of the world and
[51:00] you're going to come to that enies
[51:01] because he can't change his
[51:04] mind I said before if he loved you then
[51:06] he's going to love you now he canot love
[51:09] you why he loved Adam he canot love Adam
[51:11] even though what Adam did what Eve did
[51:13] he loved them both yes sir or he had
[51:16] destroyed them both and said hey I'm
[51:17] going to start over again but he didn't
[51:20] that's
[51:21] right he didn't say the day you eat
[51:23] there of and I you he said the day you
[51:25] eat thereof that day you're going to be
[51:26] cursed and you're going to
[51:29] die so the only begotten of the father
[51:32] ha declared him
[51:34] or definition of that is to unfold a
[51:37] teaching so God was stand I mean Jesus
[51:38] was standing there he said hey if you
[51:40] know
[51:43] me you'd know who my father
[51:46] is cuz I declare him and they looked at
[51:48] him and he said he said before Abraham
[51:50] was I am and they're they're looking
[51:52] natural they're going you're not even 50
[51:54] years old and Abraham's about 800 years
[51:56] back that way well the I am wasn't the I
[52:01] am was back there before that the I am
[52:03] the one who what talk to it the I am is
[52:06] who Abraham met and and that am is who
[52:09] you and I got to
[52:11] meet cuz to meet him he'll change your
[52:14] body yes
[52:16] sir but to let him Walk On
[52:22] By there's no telling how many people
[52:25] people melaz walk by cuz remember that
[52:28] wasn't the first time that he he was
[52:30] with
[52:32] Abraham he found him in the first of his
[52:35] journey when he became Victorious and
[52:37] slaughtered the Kings he brought him
[52:39] Bread and Wine where'd he get that
[52:40] from right and he brought him into a
[52:43] group of people because there was
[52:45] Abraham and about 300 of his servants
[52:47] and and all everybody else was pretty
[52:49] much annihilated so he goes in and
[52:51] serves in communion what a mighty God we
[52:54] serve
[52:55] to know that we can the the the reason I
[52:58] think brother brandham could tell us so
[52:59] vividly all these stories is because God
[53:02] let him see
[53:03] them and by revelation we see him
[53:05] because you know what I was in mdc's
[53:10] Soul when he talked to
[53:12] Abraham you were in mdic Saul if you're
[53:16] born again when he talked to
[53:21] Abraham praise
[53:22] God that's why we can understand who
[53:24] Jesus says cuz we were there but
[53:27] remember we had that white cloud that
[53:29] cloud was was mared white and black
[53:33] right but where were you you were
[53:36] nothing only in the mind of God where
[53:39] was the mind of God when Jesus was on
[53:40] Earth it was inside of
[53:43] him pal waren Locust
[53:46] caterpillar the Blessed Holy
[53:48] Trinity it's a man-made scheme an old
[53:51] dirty Church rag wrapped around to take
[53:52] the place of the sap line of God's holy
[53:54] spirit I made you made some people mad
[53:55] that they there's no such a thing it
[53:59] don't bother us does it I hope it
[54:01] doesn't there's no such a thing you find
[54:04] it and come to me you're Duty bound to
[54:06] do it as a Christian if you find it it's
[54:07] not in God's word anywhere and the
[54:09] father son Holy Ghost is hatched Out of
[54:14] Hell there's no such a thing as three
[54:18] gods that theophany never taught
[54:22] that everybody with me
[54:26] but it took a man to come back and
[54:28] restore even according to the Old
[54:31] Testament there had to be a jubilee
[54:33] there had to be a release every seven
[54:34] years and then 77 seven the seventh time
[54:38] around 77s is 49 the 7eventh time around
[54:42] to the 49th year there had to be a
[54:44] jubilee where everything went free and
[54:47] that's what we'll get to in the church
[54:48] ages cuz there was a group that went
[54:49] three went free at the end
[54:52] of Paul irenius Martin all those
[54:56] right they went free by the baptism of
[54:59] the Holy Ghost but they never celebrated
[55:01] a jubilee year where everything went
[55:02] free because their body's laying over
[55:04] there somewhere in the grave or in the
[55:07] dust of the Earth all right so they
[55:09] didn't all get to go free there were
[55:11] some of them had some part of them had
[55:13] to
[55:14] stay but in the Jubilee you throw down
[55:16] the hole and you took everything you had
[55:18] and you left and you didn't have owe
[55:20] that guy nothing praise God that's our
[55:24] Jubilee
[55:25] the power of God was taken back to its
[55:27] original the 50th day of the year that's
[55:30] why we needed another Penta we needed a
[55:33] Pentecost we needed a 50 a jubilee not
[55:36] just a day 1906 was considered
[55:39] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell but
[55:41] we should have a Pentecostal Jubilee
[55:43] every
[55:44] day as brother um Joe was saying the
[55:48] other day we need to let our hands and
[55:49] our mouth know it
[55:51] though Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and
[55:54] spoke to them saying all power is given
[55:56] unto me in heaven and in Earth why he
[55:58] was in a body that was
[55:59] changed his body was eternal standing
[56:02] right there now before that it was dead
[56:03] cold in the
[56:05] grave just like the ones that are
[56:07] waiting now but by the quickening power
[56:10] what happened that same spirit that was
[56:13] in that man that theophany came back
[56:15] picked that body up and stood out there
[56:16] on the earth and said all power now has
[56:17] been given unto me in other words I've
[56:19] changed this thing yes sir
[56:22] right he that believeth in me
[56:25] shall have eternal life or everlasting
[56:27] life brother M said now look there'll
[56:29] come another ju Year of Jubilee and that
[56:32] we've had it just about this time now
[56:34] he's talking about the cycle of
[56:36] Pentecost 1906 and coming into now or
[56:40] then if you know this Pentecost has been
[56:41] falling in America for about 50 years
[56:44] see CU that was 1906 and this this was
[56:48] 1961 so he's a little more than 50 years
[56:52] and we've had it just about this time
[56:53] somewhere on that time 50 years ago
[56:55] Pentecost began to fall now that's what
[56:57] happened look the church is receiving
[56:59] now look who received the seven seal
[57:02] Book of Revelations who who
[57:05] who first church age nope second Church
[57:08] age no three four five six seven no they
[57:11] rejected
[57:14] him but we're under the seven seal book
[57:18] of the revelation of Jesus Christ of the
[57:20] Seven Seals and not one tenth of them
[57:22] can receive it wow
[57:25] that wasn't even that's one out of a
[57:28] hundred but when you begin to see the
[57:30] Year of Jubilee where we don't have to
[57:33] fuss and strain and pull like this but
[57:35] we're already secured in Christ we
[57:36] already have the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:38] in bapt watch what he's saying
[57:40] everything now is being restored back we
[57:42] have the correct water baptism we have
[57:45] the correct doctrin amen you can say
[57:48] whatever you want to about brother
[57:49] random his Doctrine was
[57:52] correct we have all these great
[57:54] Mysteries that were going to bring up in
[57:55] these Seven Seals and prove to you that
[57:57] them was the seals that were sealed from
[57:59] the eyes of the
[58:03] people because you know why Martin
[58:10] Luther Martin Luther was a
[58:13] trinitarian he preached that doctrine
[58:15] that was hatched from
[58:18] hell but God wasn't looking at that at
[58:20] that moment God was looking at him
[58:22] bringing a people out that just shall
[58:24] live by faith
[58:25] that's right amen all right then a
[58:27] little bit more then a little bit more
[58:29] and now that's why when you come to the
[58:30] seven seal book we we know all the
[58:33] Mysteries it's not sealed from the eyes
[58:35] of this people it's sealed from the eyes
[58:37] of the people down through the church
[58:39] ages of God being my helper I've Prov to
[58:41] you that they could not see that by the
[58:43] Bible then sure if the Bible said so
[58:46] you'll believe it that they could not
[58:48] see nothing but father Son and Holy
[58:50] Ghost until this time they could not see
[58:53] that there was no eternal eternal hell
[58:55] until this time amen so what is this
[58:59] this is the dispensation of the open
[59:00] book The dispensation to where we should
[59:02] not have to worry about water baptism we
[59:05] know what it
[59:08] is Revelations 3:14 what we've been
[59:11] talking
[59:12] about this is the one in our time and to
[59:16] the angel the Church of the layout of
[59:17] sins right now what was the angel the
[59:19] angel was a messenger right we had a
[59:21] messenger
[59:22] come right and what did he speak
[59:25] he spoke about the beginning of the
[59:27] creation of God the faithful and true
[59:30] witness not a false witness of a false
[59:33] baptism or the false witness of a
[59:35] eternal hell no he preached the truth
[59:38] yes
[59:41] right Jesus Christ is the beginning of
[59:43] the creation of God Revelations 1 is
[59:45] that right Revelations three really then
[59:47] when was God created he is the beginning
[59:50] of the creation of God and God is
[59:52] eternal is that right but when God was
[59:54] cre created when a little baby that was
[59:56] conceived in the womb of a mother a
[59:57] virgin she began to develop these C
[59:59] within her to bring forth this little
[1:00:01] baby that was the beginning of God's
[1:00:04] creation for God was made flesh and
[1:00:06] dwelt Among Us and become Emanuel God
[1:00:08] With Us the beginning yes of the
[1:00:10] creation of God I'm going to read you a
[1:00:11] quote here in just a little bit brother
[1:00:13] R says you are now the continuation of
[1:00:15] that
[1:00:17] creation God didn't just create it and
[1:00:19] then destroy
[1:00:20] it uh-uh he created it for a purpose
[1:00:26] so God came down after going through
[1:00:28] this and now every son you eat born of a
[1:00:30] natural sex birth the way you come then
[1:00:32] when it comes to a place to where you go
[1:00:34] through water baptism then Holy Ghost
[1:00:35] baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:00:38] at the fire baptism and claims this
[1:00:41] creation the same as it did him the Holy
[1:00:44] Ghost and God is the same Spirit see it
[1:00:46] comes down and claims this
[1:00:49] body that's hard for people to
[1:00:51] understand because most people 99.9% of
[1:00:54] the people people that are not message
[1:00:56] Believers and a lot of message Believers
[1:00:57] believe the same thing this body you're
[1:00:59] never going to see
[1:01:01] again
[1:01:04] right you going to get a brand new one
[1:01:06] come from somewhere
[1:01:09] else ask you ask
[1:01:13] around it's this one
[1:01:16] redeemed that'd be really easy to just
[1:01:20] put this one in the dust and go get you
[1:01:22] another one because God's a creator
[1:01:24] but remember if we created in His image
[1:01:27] whatever image is inside of this guy now
[1:01:29] he must have enjoyed that whether you do
[1:01:31] or
[1:01:33] not amen and he put me in this flesh
[1:01:36] body give me 64 years in a couple
[1:01:40] weeks but I'm still in the image of what
[1:01:43] he saw me back before the foundation of
[1:01:45] the
[1:01:46] world but now that that has come to
[1:01:49] connect to my body down here it's going
[1:01:53] to stay there whether I pass away and my
[1:01:57] soul go in another dimension my soul's
[1:01:59] going to come back and pick that same
[1:02:00] body up cuz let me ask you a question
[1:02:02] was Jesus's body in the Tomb after he
[1:02:04] resurrected isn't he our example yes sir
[1:02:07] isn't he the first born from the dead
[1:02:09] amen right he had an empty tomb we we we
[1:02:13] we that's what we hang on to that
[1:02:16] there's no body in a
[1:02:18] graveen cuz everybody else has died
[1:02:20] whether you cremated throw in the water
[1:02:22] or wherever you got something somewhere
[1:02:24] in this earth yes sir God
[1:02:27] didn't he was born from above
[1:02:29] remember came down here and when he
[1:02:32] stepped out and said all power in Heaven
[1:02:34] and Earth has been given unto me he had
[1:02:36] an eternal
[1:02:38] body still could eat still could talk
[1:02:42] but he didn't need a door to get through
[1:02:44] praise
[1:02:46] God it comes down and claims this no
[1:02:49] Atlanta traffic boy that just come to my
[1:02:53] mind travel like a thought I go visit
[1:02:56] brother Dy man I got to worry about all
[1:02:58] that
[1:03:01] traffic I to make you happy there he
[1:03:03] comes down and claims this body for the
[1:03:06] resurrection and he was raised for our
[1:03:08] justification all the father has given
[1:03:10] me will come not one will be lost I'll
[1:03:12] raise it up now it doesn't listen if he
[1:03:15] wasn't going to keep up with you why
[1:03:17] would he say
[1:03:19] that no one will be lost now he didn't
[1:03:22] mean lost like in your soul but lost I
[1:03:24] can't I can't find his body I know I
[1:03:27] made
[1:03:29] it but I just can't find
[1:03:31] it and even brother random he says it's
[1:03:34] not exactly the same gases it may not be
[1:03:36] the same gas you emitted while you were
[1:03:39] here I'm talking about the
[1:03:41] body but it is your image of you it is
[1:03:44] your flesh wherever it was wherever it
[1:03:46] is it's coming back now here's the quote
[1:03:49] this is that is the beginning not one
[1:03:52] hair on your head will ever perish that
[1:03:53] is the beginning of the creation of God
[1:03:56] this is the
[1:03:57] continuation of the creation of God you
[1:03:59] and me yes then the whole earth has to
[1:04:02] have a baptism and then the Holy Ghost
[1:04:04] comes down in a city to dwell upon the
[1:04:06] earth and the Tabernacle of God is with
[1:04:08] man and dwells with them God has
[1:04:10] tabernacled here on Earth this whole
[1:04:13] Redemption plant justification
[1:04:16] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:17] the same as it is then now he's talking
[1:04:20] about if you look in the future home
[1:04:22] he's talking about the same identical
[1:04:23] thing cu earth goes through and I'll
[1:04:25] read it here in just a
[1:04:27] minute cuz see that's where
[1:04:29] denominations also see the reason
[1:04:31] denominations can believe that this
[1:04:32] Earth is going to be
[1:04:34] destroyed CU I'm going to read
[1:04:38] it fervent Heat going to be all that
[1:04:40] I'll read it here in just a minute Peter
[1:04:42] remember brother R uses that scripture
[1:04:44] in the future home right but it's not
[1:04:47] annihilated so he's not going to
[1:04:48] annihilate your flesh and give you
[1:04:50] another
[1:04:51] one right everybody with me if he
[1:04:54] doesn't annihilate the Earth he can
[1:04:57] annihilate you cuz watch Isaiah 65 says
[1:05:01] for behold I create new Heavens now boy
[1:05:03] say new who that's new yeah it is and a
[1:05:08] new Earth and the former shall not be
[1:05:10] remembered nor come into mine praise God
[1:05:12] for that but be ye glad and rejoice
[1:05:14] forever in that which I create for I
[1:05:16] behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing
[1:05:19] and her people a joy praise God there's
[1:05:22] going to come earthquakes there's going
[1:05:23] to come a fervent heat there's going to
[1:05:25] come a power a Holy Ghost Fire that's
[1:05:28] going to burn everything off it's going
[1:05:30] to take this world that's wobbling it's
[1:05:31] going to take this world that's wobbling
[1:05:34] and it's going to set it
[1:05:37] upright we'll be able to enjoy the
[1:05:41] pleasures of
[1:05:42] God second Peter 3:9 says the Lord is
[1:05:45] not slack concerning his promises some
[1:05:47] men count slackness but it's
[1:05:48] longsuffering to us word praise God not
[1:05:50] willing that any should perish but that
[1:05:52] all should come to repentance but the
[1:05:54] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[1:05:56] the night in which the heavens shall
[1:05:59] pass away with a great noise now watch
[1:06:01] it it just seems like when you read this
[1:06:04] that God's just going
[1:06:07] to ain't going to start right back over
[1:06:09] Crea again no listen what God created
[1:06:12] the first time he can't
[1:06:15] uncreate he
[1:06:18] can't but he can hide it from the wise
[1:06:21] and prudent and show that they believe
[1:06:24] it's going to be destroyed and we're
[1:06:26] going to like live on this cloud or
[1:06:27] we're going to go to this new
[1:06:29] residence and it really tells us in
[1:06:31] scripture brother Dy that the that John
[1:06:32] saw the city coming down where was John
[1:06:34] standing he was standing on Earth he saw
[1:06:37] it coming down so it's going to sit down
[1:06:38] on the earth thank God for a prophet
[1:06:40] that just pull those little nuggets out
[1:06:41] of the Bible to tell us and he even read
[1:06:43] this scripture and he goes back and and
[1:06:45] goes into the Greek and where it says
[1:06:47] you know annihilate and all these
[1:06:48] different things well it doesn't really
[1:06:49] mean that it just burns it
[1:06:52] off same way he did with with me and you
[1:06:54] like I said before this that used to
[1:06:56] hold a beer now holds a Bible so God
[1:06:58] didn't have to cut it off and give me a
[1:07:00] a Bible
[1:07:02] hand he took the beer hand he took the
[1:07:05] beer he took the foul mouth and the eyes
[1:07:09] and just changed
[1:07:10] them that's why Holy Ghost Fire can burn
[1:07:13] you and you not even oh yeah you'll show
[1:07:15] it but you're not going to be
[1:07:17] annihilated and then walk back in a new
[1:07:20] person that's the
[1:07:22] mystery it would not be a mystery if you
[1:07:24] could do that if everybody could just
[1:07:25] disappear and reappear as a you know
[1:07:27] 100% perfect
[1:07:31] person but that wouldn't be the plan of
[1:07:33] God he can be a savior A Healer Redeemer
[1:07:36] all these different compound names of
[1:07:38] Jehovah that we see that's connected to
[1:07:40] this body absolutely and what we do on
[1:07:43] this earth right but the day of the Lord
[1:07:45] shall come as a thief in the night in
[1:07:47] which the heavens shall pass away with
[1:07:48] great noise and the elements shall melt
[1:07:51] now it didn't say
[1:07:52] annihilate it's it says the element
[1:07:54] shall melt with fervent heat the Earth
[1:07:57] also and the works that are therein
[1:07:59] shall be burned
[1:08:01] up well it sounds like it's just going
[1:08:03] to totally no it took a prophet to go
[1:08:06] back and tell us that doesn't mean what
[1:08:09] it looks like it
[1:08:11] means right seeing then that all these
[1:08:14] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[1:08:16] person ought to be ye to be in all holy
[1:08:19] conversation and godliness looking for
[1:08:22] and Hasting unto the coming of the day
[1:08:23] of of God wherein the heaven shall be on
[1:08:26] fire and shall be
[1:08:29] dissolved and the element shall melt
[1:08:31] with fervent heat question mark
[1:08:34] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:08:37] look for new heavens and a new Earth
[1:08:40] wherein dwelleth righteousness and that
[1:08:42] word new is not new like throw it away
[1:08:45] and bring a new one out is to renew or
[1:08:48] renovate that's what he did to me and
[1:08:50] you he renovated our that's right right
[1:08:54] you look at house renovation how many
[1:08:57] ever ever been through one I've been
[1:08:58] through one what you do you burn it
[1:09:02] start over no you renovate you take out
[1:09:05] the
[1:09:06] old you take out the
[1:09:09] diseased you take out the weak yes sir
[1:09:13] and you make it strong again but the
[1:09:15] bones of that house is still there you
[1:09:17] know something people tell you those
[1:09:18] house builders will say boy that house
[1:09:20] has got good bones what does it mean
[1:09:21] it's got a good structure to it right
[1:09:24] now you can take all this out and redo
[1:09:26] it but the structure the bones is still
[1:09:30] here well guess what God's not going to
[1:09:33] lose the one of them he said remember
[1:09:35] God perfecting his church
[1:09:38] 1954 this is why we can see you can't
[1:09:41] destroy
[1:09:43] deity you can't destroy the deity of God
[1:09:47] so deity lays in the mind that's
[1:09:49] received the Holy Spirit you're are a
[1:09:50] son I'm a brandham by birth part of Mr M
[1:09:52] brandham is in me and if you become a
[1:09:54] son or a daughter of God part of deity
[1:09:56] lays in you yes sir part of the city
[1:09:58] lays in you part of the
[1:10:01] power to
[1:10:03] speak and things
[1:10:06] happen
[1:10:09] am power of the spoken
[1:10:12] word and I didn't do this God did this
[1:10:15] he said I'm not going to be here to do
[1:10:18] it you're going to do it I'm going to do
[1:10:22] it through you yes sir I'm not going to
[1:10:23] be here
[1:10:27] physically talking about the breath is
[1:10:29] where brother Ram talks about Adam he
[1:10:32] was a breathing living man so he's a
[1:10:33] breathing living man and then we keep
[1:10:35] going a little bit further he says look
[1:10:37] CU God breathed not what nature done but
[1:10:39] what God did breathe the breath of life
[1:10:41] into his nostrils and he became a living
[1:10:42] Soul so you and I at the new birth
[1:10:45] that's what we get and that's what
[1:10:47] happened that's why I stuck that in
[1:10:49] there is that's what's going to happen
[1:10:51] to the new Heaven and the new Earth
[1:10:53] God's going to breathe on It come on cuz
[1:10:55] it's the fire of God it's not man's fire
[1:10:57] listen the battle of Armageddon is going
[1:10:58] to be man's fire we're going to come
[1:11:00] back in the Millennium and there's still
[1:11:02] going to be trees and this building may
[1:11:03] still be here they may be structure
[1:11:05] still here cuz brother R said remember
[1:11:07] that seventh day Satan's still alive
[1:11:10] he's bound but this sin curse is still
[1:11:13] here come on until the future home comes
[1:11:17] that's right cuz we're still in seven
[1:11:19] days the seventh day it lasts all the
[1:11:22] way to White Throne judgment
[1:11:25] so God what is he going to
[1:11:26] do he going to breathe the breath of
[1:11:28] eternal life into us then we're going to
[1:11:31] what we're going to be taken out set up
[1:11:32] somewhere then he's going to take nature
[1:11:36] we're going to get that six seal nature
[1:11:39] there's a destruction of nature in the
[1:11:41] sick seal yes by a holy fire
[1:11:48] right not man's fire man's fire only
[1:11:51] Burns so much God's fire burn Burns it
[1:11:53] completely up come on you know what
[1:11:56] though he can burn a bush and not even
[1:11:57] bother it he can burn you yes sir and
[1:12:01] not even
[1:12:02] bothering but you what you'll do you'll
[1:12:04] outwardly produce what just got put
[1:12:06] inside of you
[1:12:09] okay cuz you talking about Adam already
[1:12:11] in his nostrils he had become the breath
[1:12:13] of eternal life and he became the living
[1:12:14] Soul he everybody understand that I
[1:12:16] don't have to go over that again
[1:12:17] especially on Adam he breathed the
[1:12:19] breath of eternal life and he became an
[1:12:21] eternal person with God so do me and you
[1:12:24] yes power like God amateur God but what
[1:12:26] happened was there was that cloud came
[1:12:28] in of sin and that's what we're born
[1:12:31] under but the new birth should be what
[1:12:33] letting out all that getting rid of the
[1:12:35] flu that are stopped up the unclean
[1:12:38] Spirit goes out of a man here stands a
[1:12:40] white horse here stands a lamb and there
[1:12:42] goes a white horse rider things are
[1:12:43] going away from us and God's coming and
[1:12:46] filling us up cuz Dwight Moody said God
[1:12:48] will only fill those who are not full of
[1:12:50] their
[1:12:51] self there's not room for you and God
[1:12:54] now it's just got to be God all right
[1:12:56] that's what we call
[1:12:58] preeminence the church is a mystical
[1:13:00] Body of Christ born of the Breath of
[1:13:03] God he talks about spiritually so we're
[1:13:05] going to talk about the same thing
[1:13:06] spiritually Church born of the Breath of
[1:13:10] God
[1:13:12] cuz if you walk around in the world and
[1:13:15] and you talk to
[1:13:16] people and they know you're a little
[1:13:19] different but I mean us men we could
[1:13:22] walk in any church and sit
[1:13:24] down and be just like the next
[1:13:28] guy but when a sister walks in and sits
[1:13:31] down with the dress on right they
[1:13:36] go what's wrong with her oh granny you
[1:13:39] know what though that's the
[1:13:41] bride so now we got to transfer that
[1:13:44] back to us men we don't have long hair
[1:13:46] we don't chew the bager we don't XYZ
[1:13:48] right cuz we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:13:50] Christ we are
[1:13:51] feminist in the body of of Christ
[1:13:53] because we're born by the Breath of
[1:13:57] God when you become a child of God
[1:14:00] you're born by the Breath of God the
[1:14:02] breath of almighty God he already gave
[1:14:04] you a a body and and your parents that
[1:14:07] body you got a spirit Soul right he give
[1:14:11] you that already that's what nature he
[1:14:13] has a law when something starts
[1:14:15] breathing when something need to start
[1:14:16] breathing he breathes and gives them
[1:14:17] life but it didn't give them eternal
[1:14:19] life that's why we're all born dead
[1:14:21] until we do get the Breath of God
[1:14:24] not in our lungs in our very Soul amen
[1:14:28] and cleans us
[1:14:32] out first God makes a soul and a spirit
[1:14:35] and it goes into the body we understand
[1:14:37] that I'll just keep going a little bit
[1:14:38] further we'll close here in just a
[1:14:39] second soon as it's born but there's a
[1:14:42] spirit and a soul hanging near that
[1:14:43] mother to come into that body just as
[1:14:44] soon as it's
[1:14:45] born just as soon as that's baby born
[1:14:48] God has created a soul and created a
[1:14:49] spirit to be in that baby just as soon
[1:14:51] as it's born in this world now look that
[1:14:53] little baby becomes
[1:14:55] matured and it begins to learn like
[1:14:58] we've always said before you take a
[1:15:00] 5-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy put
[1:15:02] him in a bathtub give him a bath and
[1:15:03] they're just playing you know and
[1:15:04] they're throwing water and 10 years
[1:15:07] later don't do that am same two people
[1:15:10] same scenario what's happened their
[1:15:13] carnal mind has been activated yes sir
[1:15:16] all right everybody with me just as soon
[1:15:19] as that baby is born God has created a
[1:15:21] soul and created a spirit to be in that
[1:15:22] baby just as soon as it's born in this
[1:15:24] world that little baby becomes matured
[1:15:26] and it begins to learn then it becomes a
[1:15:29] living Soul now remember it wasn't a
[1:15:30] dead
[1:15:31] Soul it becomes alive to what it becomes
[1:15:34] alive to the senses of the world yes
[1:15:37] this is right this is
[1:15:39] wrong cuz I want to ask you a question I
[1:15:41] just told you what brother B said all
[1:15:43] babies go to
[1:15:44] heaven now how many of your kids never
[1:15:46] started lying till they're about
[1:15:52] 14
[1:15:55] God don't hold it accountable to you
[1:15:57] because you don't know really what
[1:15:59] you're doing you're just born under that
[1:16:01] curse cuz listen if brother R said all
[1:16:03] babies go to heaven when you come to the
[1:16:05] age of accountability listen three and
[1:16:06] four five year old kids they'll lie to
[1:16:10] you but God don't account that to them
[1:16:12] because God is so gracious to have all
[1:16:14] that already set up sister Alicia he had
[1:16:17] it all set
[1:16:18] up he knew we'd have babies yes sir he
[1:16:21] knew that we'd have and listen all those
[1:16:23] babies that have that have died you
[1:16:25] think well that's
[1:16:26] horrible maybe not
[1:16:29] so they going to be in
[1:16:31] heaven but if they' have got up to 14 or
[1:16:34] 15 years old and made the wrong decision
[1:16:35] they might not have been in heaven thank
[1:16:37] God for a gracious God that
[1:16:41] knows then it becomes intelligent it's
[1:16:43] growing on now that's kind of brother R
[1:16:45] I got a little problem with that people
[1:16:48] get kids get intelligent at
[1:16:50] 14 maybe 34
[1:16:54] but I you know what he's talking about
[1:16:56] it becomes intelligent it's growing all
[1:16:57] the time in God's Great economy now
[1:16:59] listen here's what brother B tells us
[1:17:01] I'll say this by the authority of God's
[1:17:02] word all
[1:17:04] right every baby that's under the age of
[1:17:07] accountability that dies goes to glory
[1:17:10] amen yes sir Christ died to take away
[1:17:12] the sin of the world and when you come
[1:17:14] to the age of accountability we're all
[1:17:16] born in sin but when he died he taken
[1:17:19] away the sin and when you come to the
[1:17:21] age of accountability then you're
[1:17:23] responsible from then on all right now
[1:17:27] the age of accountability you can count
[1:17:28] that whatever you want
[1:17:30] to you're the only one that knows that
[1:17:33] one day you're you're going to say I
[1:17:35] really shouldn't have done that that
[1:17:37] wasn't
[1:17:38] right so I can't say well now when you
[1:17:41] get 14 you're
[1:17:42] no may be different than some but you'll
[1:17:47] know you're not responsible for
[1:17:49] something you did not do Christ done
[1:17:51] died to save you to take away the sin
[1:17:53] that Adam caused we always think Eve
[1:17:56] caused
[1:17:56] that Adam caused it Adam's one his sold
[1:18:00] us
[1:18:01] out but when you sin you have to confess
[1:18:03] your sins first you have to confess it
[1:18:06] but the babies's done no sin it it's not
[1:18:09] accountable for what it does and Christ
[1:18:11] died to free that baby and if it's born
[1:18:14] of a parent drunkard or whatever they
[1:18:15] might be that baby goes to heaven I
[1:18:18] believe it and I believe it'll come to
[1:18:20] recognition of the Cross now watch this
[1:18:23] this struck me right here never read
[1:18:24] this quote before I read many about age
[1:18:26] of accountability but maybe I didn't
[1:18:27] read far enough now look and I believe
[1:18:30] it'll come to
[1:18:32] recognition of the
[1:18:34] Cross when it gets
[1:18:38] there to know that Christ died for it
[1:18:42] thank God for a prophet do you
[1:18:44] understand what he's saying if a
[1:18:45] 5-year-old kid
[1:18:47] dies they don't know anything about
[1:18:49] Jesus Christ they probably heard it in
[1:18:50] many different languages but not the
[1:18:51] real the right one right right my right
[1:18:54] but when he go that person goes or that
[1:18:57] kid individual goes into whatever
[1:19:00] holding place there is heaven or
[1:19:02] whatever Dimension he comes to or she
[1:19:04] comes to a realization an angel probably
[1:19:07] comes up and says hey buddy the reason
[1:19:08] you goty here called that guy right
[1:19:11] there and let me tell you about what
[1:19:15] happened and now because the baby is far
[1:19:17] as Sin it has none wow Jesus died to
[1:19:20] take away the sins of the world and the
[1:19:22] baby has done no sin only it was it's a
[1:19:25] sinner it's born in sin but when Christ
[1:19:27] died at Calvary he took away the sins of
[1:19:30] the world and the baby is not
[1:19:31] responsible until it becomes to the age
[1:19:34] of accountability any little baby no
[1:19:37] matter how sinful the parents are as
[1:19:38] soon as it dies it goes straight to the
[1:19:40] arms of Christ because he prayed the
[1:19:43] price no matter if it was a baby born in
[1:19:45] sin by adultery or whatever it is makes
[1:19:47] no difference at all that baby is safe
[1:19:49] with Christ because he died to take away
[1:19:51] the sins absolutely of the the world now
[1:19:53] what now look though and when he gets
[1:19:57] old enough now that it's done personal
[1:20:00] sin then it has to repent for what it's
[1:20:02] done personal sin because remember the
[1:20:05] Bible says you don't pay for the sin of
[1:20:06] your father you pay for your sin but it
[1:20:08] has no personal sin look until it's old
[1:20:11] enough to commit sin to know which is
[1:20:14] right and which is
[1:20:15] wrong thank God for a God that do that
[1:20:18] can do that that knew that Millions
[1:20:20] listen there's billions of babies d
[1:20:22] before the age of accountability they're
[1:20:24] going to be in
[1:20:26] heaven what a mighty God we serve all
[1:20:29] right let's stand we'll we'll we'll
[1:20:31] cover this
[1:20:32] more this afternoon didn't get to my
[1:20:35] point but we'll get to it here in just a
[1:20:46] minute we'll get to it this afternoon
[1:20:49] would you love the
[1:20:50] Lord the Lord's gracious isn't he to
[1:20:52] tell us that that baby doesn't have any
[1:20:55] sin you look at it you don't listen you
[1:20:58] might call it a little bit sinner but it
[1:21:00] ain't not in God's
[1:21:03] eyes okay not in God's eyes but now kids
[1:21:07] when you realize you go oh I shouldn't
[1:21:09] have done that and I'm going to hide it
[1:21:10] from if you start hiding stuff from your
[1:21:14] parents you've reached the age of
[1:21:17] capability right when you start hiding
[1:21:20] stuff and and not telling them the truth
[1:21:23] all the truth and you know you're going
[1:21:25] to hide it cuz you did this over here
[1:21:27] then yeah you you probably need to start
[1:21:29] repenting asking God
[1:21:32] to toh forgive you of your
[1:21:35] sins and baptize you with the Holy Ghost

[1:24:43] of what you got I've seen you do a lot
[1:24:45] of Miracles I know God's with
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:51] you personally I want a double portion
[1:24:54] of what you
[1:24:55] got Elijah said what that's a hard thing
[1:24:59] brother Brown said it's hard to live
[1:25:00] this life that
[1:25:03] way amen he said but if you see me when
[1:25:08] I
[1:25:12] go problem is some people ain't seen him
[1:25:15] go
[1:25:15] yet all right they still press play and
[1:25:18] they still think he's coming back oh
[1:25:21] yeah he's coming back
[1:25:23] right he's coming back on that
[1:25:25] Chariot cuz Elijah got caught up one day
[1:25:30] and a
[1:25:33] chariot firing
[1:25:36] Angels horses hey Elisha saw
[1:25:39] it but Elisha
[1:25:42] saw that he
[1:25:44] left and know what he said he he say
[1:25:47] when you see he said when you see me
[1:25:48] leave if you're here if you're in the
[1:25:51] disp
[1:25:53] if you're in a
[1:25:54] dispensation to be able to see me and

[1:26:00] left I'm going to send you back a double
[1:26:03] portion of what I got I read you a quote
[1:26:06] this afternoon where brother Bri tells
[1:26:07] us he said when that headstone comes in
[1:26:09] the end time he said what you've seen
[1:26:11] now what did we see millions of
[1:26:14] Miracles we saw um third Paul we saw
[1:26:18] things being created he said what you
[1:26:21] see in the minority what you have seen
[1:26:24] he said you'll see in its
[1:26:27] fullness double
[1:26:29] portion I like that song Days of Elijah
[1:26:31] but we're not in the Days of Elijah

[1:26:43] typed the what the
[1:26:46] bride yeah oh yeah he's gone

[1:26:57] but he sent back
[1:26:58] 1,00 and
[1:27:01] something
[1:27:04] manels cuz what did Elisha do with that
[1:27:07] manle before he left he did a
[1:27:12] miracle he said where be the god of
[1:27:16] Elijah and that water party just the
