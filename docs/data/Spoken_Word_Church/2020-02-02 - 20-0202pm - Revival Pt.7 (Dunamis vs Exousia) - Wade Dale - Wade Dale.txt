========================================

who is mercy road my love I should they're falling my soul Casta but mercy rewrote my amen since we're here we're gonna take advantage and sing god bless you all I guess first off I've just got to praise the Lord a miracle has happened in my in my life in my very eyes I'm telling y'all witness my momma yesterday she needed help on her hike because her pipe was leaking I was at no.1 like how to expect her gonna try to take her out to eat my mama suffers with COPD and heart disease and heart failure actually it's been times like has year 2019 have been so rough you guys have no idea I think my mama stretched out on a recliner not able to walk now it was to bathe herself you know she had like a little bit of weight on her to not be like how I am now big like how I am isn't meant to be smaller I got all the weight on me right now but my mom the Lord did a miracle in her she cannot walk she was on oxygen 24 hours a day she could just walk with a little roller thing barely making it and kind of kind of help her get up help her sit down it has been helped bathe her she had a nurse coming in every day we came out earlier said us to help her fix up height hello and behold open the door my mom won't let you talk about 40 pounds we're just kind of surprised really slender but her natural state is being slender she was walking talking I was like thank you Jesus mama thank you Jesus thank you Jesus oh my goodness thank you Jesus I cannot go without thinking my lord but the miracle was so great it was just so much for me we took her out to eat she walked in the restaurant she walked herself out she put herself into the van it was a miracle I'm telling it's a miracle to me if I know my Lord Jesus did it there's so many times I prayed there our testimony broke my heart you know sometimes you try to hold yourself around your family people you know you don't want to get emotional and upset them as she was just speaking to me about how hard it's been for her she said sometimes she wouldn't lay there spending so much like pain and despair like me to get around everything like Lord just take me make me write this let me give me rest Lord either heal me or give me rest I'm emotional my momma said these things because I don't wanna get all upset or anything like she does really know how I am just personally like in my heart she just share that let me just broke my heart somebody's house I want to fix my momma it's like I want to be the one to fix it only be the one who figures it doctor only be the one to help her but I have three kids husband a lot of responsibilities they can't really be there for her in that way to carry her on my shoulders and I have really prayed I really prayed and I said like lord please let my mama died brother I'm like Lord if I have a way to Dalby forgive me Jesus about have you waited for me I'm serious God forgive me Who am I I'm nothing but that is by His grace he told me how to dress my just oh that I got on SSI my husband bought it for me and I da put it on this morning it's a long hard so I just sing the songs he is glory God answer my prayers you know it's super emotional affair like I find like here it's been a very new experience for me most people are not very emotional I kind of know it's just new for me it's really new we went to churches very lively so it's coming like to be used to everything being taught and listening and learning you know just humbling you know in learning things by His grace it's been a long journey but I think the Lord kind of kept me back to see my momma walking he's don't know it's a miracle it's a miracle to see like so much all that water weight came off of her she was holding so much fluid in the last prayer because I asked for her the surgeons actually want to get another surgery on her because of her so I got some valves they put in her are leaking fluids through her body that's like mama I don't want you get any more surgery every time she gets surgery it sets her back let's prance with Lord Jesus like if it's not his women have a surgery it would heal those valves you know her he is more than able he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe it I mean he saved me I was a rank Center nothing was good in me I'm not ashamed to know the truth nothing was good and this woman right here it's only His grace I did everything there was to be done you know as far as I look at it but God His mercy he picked me up and cleaned me up you know my kids had the same experience I can't even though much as I want to fix them as a momma I know I can't do it they have that experience the Lord and it's what I want for them this song is just a little song I know this song but I'm too nervous like just to try to feel like I know what in my mind but I need to look at it so I can sing it but God bless you all thank you for your prayers thank you so much trouble become knocking at your door don't be afraid you know it's not like before don't you give in

mean the Lord just we knew something was happening in our life I mean it was so real I went to my office and I told him I didn't know what was happening and felt like the rapture was gonna happen you know and I told him something was taking place we were settled in Maryland of course everything was fine and I've worked five minutes from my house but during that time I knew something was happening I went to the office you know we business we don't be just practical straight you know and I said everything that we know is about to change that's all I told them and I said just I'm not you know chores you don't want to be a fanatic and people they know they don't understand these things but I said as far as everything I know everything is going to change you just mark that and certainly a little bit after that just everything the job closed down with started traveling to Asia everything that we knew changed and we ended up here by the grace of Lord Jesus and we've been enjoying it

heads the Heavenly Father thank you for this day that you give us it's another day that we can have breath and life here on the earth and Lord on top of all that we're able to hear from you Raber to be able to get our nourishment sure from the food that you so graciously give us from the ground but Lord the manna from heaven is what we're looking for right now it's that word that will come and we'll never ever make you sick or make your thoughts be wrong Lord this this food that's coming Lord is it's just so precious and pure because it comes from you Lord we thank you for this day that we're living in we thank you for the church we have here Lord all the Deacons the elders pastor all the different ones we thank you for them every every time we we pray we thank you for the people that are here that are assembled together for the ones that are sick that are not with us we pray that you would just heal them father touch their bodies Lord just be with the ones that are on the highways the ones that are not they're not serving the Lord downstairs here and below my feet Lord always we remember that wall of of people that that we're just expecting Lord that that you'll touch their heart and and they'll come on to you father we pray that you'd just be with us now and the further men of the service give us this day our daily bread in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Psalms 138 verse 8 do I walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of my enemies and our right hand shall save me the Lord will perfect that which concerning me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine own hands all right let's read Psalms 85 1 turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us to cease wilt thou be angry with us forever wilt out draw out that anger to all generations will not revive us again that the people may rejoice indeed you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing and reading of the word there's always a rejoicing wilt thou not revive us again that thou people may rejoice indeed that's what a revival is supposed to do as we were in the Bible study last night and and one of them older sisters back there sister Gaby's girl hee she's the oldest one but she asked a question what's the difference in resurrection and and revival well we're not talking about resurrection today sure we're supposed to be resurrected sitting in heavenly places that we as we were talking about we're supposed to already have the Holy Ghost if you already have the Holy Ghost then you need a revival you need something what to spark what's already inside of you something too to make you and the way I see it is is is you can't help but see a revival because something changes in the individuals and you can see it we know that it is an individual revival but if you see faces listen this is just this way it is if you see somebody you know get a spark of a revelation or you see somebody that that hadn't been to church in a while or or you know you see them you see something moving you see something changing you see at least maybe there's expressions on your face now where you've set for all the years with you know with the stone face you know it's just something what everybody else is looking for the church to fill up and I still have a worship team in here brother Russ he said he could get us a worship team for about five thousand dollars you can bring them in here and bring the lights and the smoke and and you know and all that and we could have we could have a revival but that wouldn't be a revival coming from God that would just be making you feel good and you can do that to yourself we're left to 6,000 dollars but you know people do that no but they pay for that to come in to spark the people but but I think if we'll just realize it's got to come from in here anyway it's got to come from deep down inside of you I mean deep down not not in the spirit realm not in the flesh room but not in the soul of man there's got to be a revival to revive what's already inside of you okay kind of like we were explaining last night is it's it's something that's there and something that you know brother Brown said that David didn't lose the salvation he lost the joy he lost the joy have we lost the joy of what we're doing his brother Dale was reading the quote you know this morning you know there's a lot of things that we we just are we just coming to church and if we not changed in the past year two years 10 years 15 years 20 years whatever it is if we've not something has brought us closer to God or either brought us away from God one of the tape remember brother man said your Christian cannot stand idle God is not idle so if you're standing in one place remember you know that how to backslide it's just stay in the place you're in because what's gonna happen is the ones that are not Baxley is gonna move forward and you're gonna be going well I didn't but I didn't go backwards well yeah you did you just didn't realize you went backwards because everybody else went forward but thank God that backsliding has a reverse you can get back in line as a backslider can get right back in line if you'll do what have a revival let something spark in you that had a spark before I'm going to you know brother Brown says it's all on your confession right just what you confess so if you confess that you're going to have a revival then let it start let something one little something start in your life that'll move you toward that let's read the the prayer brother Joe's got it up on the monitor downstairs but this is a to me this covers it all brother branham in 1964 recognizing your Danis message he said God created me revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst created me Lord that what is needed in me see there's things I need in me that both John doesn't need but there's things in both John needs that I don't need this thing each one of us have different needs because we're all different parts of the body at one body but we're different parts we're different members so let us from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let us press toward the mark of the high calling of Christ turn down all that negativism just get away from it you know the best way to combat negativism don't make no comment at all because if you start yeah and back and forth and back and forth it ain't you become negative but the best thing to do is just leave it alone just don't even say nothin to it don't don't even say nothin to negativism just leave it alone we'll do even talk to it it's the devil anyway alright let's go to number two the resurrection of Lazarus we're just kind of the background this goes we're going to try to get to a place that were we were talking about last Sunday at the very end of the service a transfer of power and that's what we're looking for we're looking for the power we listen we have got as we were talking downstairs in the Sunday School class when we read The Book of Revelations it doesn't scare a Christian in this end time to read the book of Revelation because we know the symbols we know what place we we know that that a prophet of God gave us he give us all of the church ages he give us all of the men none of these men I don't think thought they were they Church of a church age messenger they had a message it was a powerful message they went forth but they died but here we are with all of it the full seven-course milled the open book everything's here for us information was that we can look in the Book of Revelations and literally live through it I said literally because John didn't literally live dude he saw a vision and then he died but you and I are that part that we see of the vision that we're either going to make it or not we're either going to be Christ to the Antichrist because that's usually what the Book of Revelations is it's the it's the Antichrist in and Jesus Christ and that's pretty much to all of the Book of Revelations and what and the actions of what goes on to the people during that time so there's people to be this people to be saved people be deceived people to be foolish version and all that is in the Book of Revelations and we see it not coming we see it right here and we can live through it because the Prophet has brought us a message and as I was telling them down I you know all these people like brother Dale said to you we need to find their seventh angel message because the Bible promises let's get back to the Bible okay let's get back to the Bible the book of Revelation says I'm going to send you seven angels' and they will have a message and to the Angel of the Church of and to the Angel of the Church of well there's one in Laodicea we got to find him if brother Branham wasn't yet what if I wasn't a message then we need to find somebody because it's coming because it's the promise in the Bible I just don't you know anyway it's just the devil it's just the Antichrist spirit I told them last night brother man said if we get the what true revelation of the two spirits in the framework and I'm going to say this the framework of this church till that's what's killing us what's the framework the building it starts right here you and I are going to make the whole Bible come to pass whether you're a Christian or whether you're not a Christian one way or the other you're fitting in there somewhere and today when we talk about this we're gonna talk about two different powers one power you're gonna hear brother Ernie probably say it next Sunday he loves to say this word Dunamis which is the word dynamite so you got Dunamis power and then you've got a power called and it's different a power called EXO sia or ex sucia there's two different powers one power is an inherent power that you have inside of you another power is power and authority given to you because Satan can't have Dunamis but he can have EXO SIA hey so SIA is authority that means Authority was just like you say in the Book of Revelations will read in a minute power was given well that's not Dunamis Dunamis power is the baptism holy ghost so he can't get the Holy Ghost to the devil but he can give him a sucia our authority are a limited amount of power but Dunamis there is not a limited amount of power Dunamis is what created this world amen so any waiting that so now if you fall asleep you'll know what the end of the service is the resurrection of Lazarus and Lulla Church brother Brown said brother I feel real good about it now anyway what this church needs today is a good revival not a new doctrine the new order so we're not looking for a new doctrine new order new person just a stirring up with what you already know about all right and remember it comes from you just going back for a couple of quotes that I didn't put in here save time it comes from you it doesn't come from the preacher can't bring it now we can bring we can bring the way to get one the way to get the revival but we can't press you into that revival because it's a word revival now we can pump you up and give you some extra extra sex zuzia but Dunamis power is what we're looking for that's a power that is inherited remember what is the promise brother then something much they didn't receive the promise they didn't receive the promise of Dunamis they had XO sia they had XOC of power they had Authority Barack David all the different ones in the Old Testament they had that permitted power our authority to do what they did but they did not have Dunamis power Dunamis power comes from inside of you dynamite explosion everybody okay with that but there had to be a transfer of power and we'll get to that in just a second but let's finish these let's go to quote number three so it's got to come from you it can't come from your neighbors got to come from you you've got a route you've got to start a revival in your own life and when you do it will change you hello it will change you I want to be changed because if we're Cheng's now forget the body change forget the body change if we don't get changing out brother Brian the Bible says were changed from what glory to glory we're being born again it's the process it's because of the lack of revival among the people there is no revival now we know we're gonna read the quote where brother Brown says the bride hadn't had a revival yet but she's gonna have one but there's no revival here they sit and listen go home well I guess that was pretty good on huh there's not that zeal now remember that word zeal is fervor our passion there's not that something in the people that should be there now he's not saying that they're not Christians there's just something in the church or in the people that are there something they're lacking and I believe what it is it's a word revival it's the revival of the Word of God into people but we're promised that this revival is going to come folks whether you can it's like it's like who was it I may be a brother branham he said you know you you know you go out in the morning and about four o'clock in the morning you get on your knees and you say God the sun's not gonna come up the sun's not I believe the sun's not gonna come up my son's gonna come up because God has already put in motion that that thing's gonna come up every every how many hours so you can't pray that down now you can pray that it stops because somebody did one time somebody named Joshua with excessive power not do too much but he got authority from God to do what he said what about us that's what brother Brown was always trying to tell us what about us with the power inside of us through the whole Old Testament they did all of that without the Holy Ghost inside of their soul leading them and guiding them that authority was enough for them to stop the son change the course of all different things but where's the revival it's got to be among the people that there is no revival they sit they go and listen say well that was a pretty good sermon there's not that zeal there's not that something in the people that should be there now what brother rush were you looking for it that's what it is there's that something there's that something that we're still here 50 years later there's that something we're lacking but we can't keep saying there's something lacking something somewhere down the road something's got a spark if something gotta hit us yeah I don't know God may have to hit us with a 10-ton brick some of us can be touched by feathers some of us it takes bricks remember some come kicking and screaming and some come praising the Lord so I was one of those that come kicking and screaming so but you know what same results we're here we have arrived so let's go - Joel - here's your promise be glad then you children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of weed and the facts shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore or revive to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm kind of pill upon warm cuz remember whatever those bugs did they never killed the tree they never killed the tree the tree still had life in it let's just say that tree had Dunamis life in it it had life that what brother understood that life went down into them roots and just hid and then God just called it right back up amen so I will restore it to you so it's a promise now maybe that's the promise to the Jews we know that and that's the promise that to Israel I mean but that's the promise to me in you because he's gonna pour out his spirit upon all flesh okay but I will restore our revive to you the years that the locust is eating cankerworm pummel worm caterpillar my great army which I sent among you remember it's the same bug just in different stages all right so let's go to number four brother I was talking about that little that little Creek bubbling up they said it didn't need no filter no strainer no pumping no jerking no nothing else it's just there bubbling up it don't have to depend on local rains to fill it up rains or revivals where that fountain that's at that fountain of life where the carcasses the Eagles will gather thank God the Book of Revelations tells us that there's going to be a river of life flowing out from under the throne perpetually for eternity this thing is going to flow and keep flowing and you're not gonna need a filter man it's not gonna have to build a pump we're not gonna have to have maintenance workers in the Millenium or in the future home we might in the Millennium but not in the future home future home everything is that perpetual Dunamis power that said let there be and it did and it didn't it didn't hinder anything what's the greatest hindrance take your finger and turn it around and go there's the greatest hindrance most of us do this and stop that you're supposed to do this I'm my worst enemy you're your worst enemy but God give us away he give us something he gave us a power that no person has ever been given he'd give us a an inherent power and we'll read that in just a minute now look where we at number four where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered so it's got to be now watch what he says why did he bring that in with rains or revival why did he bring them where the carcass is the Eagles will gather remember the carcass is what the Word of God so it's got to be a word revival that this rain is going to fall on to this word that's already been there I was thinking this a few minutes ago as I said before look at all this information we got but if it's not quickened its dead letter we've got all the information we need we've had a prophet come and give us the love letter that God wrote before the foundation of the world delivered it to us so when we look at what are we lacking we're lacking me being the problem but God's trying to send us a rain or a revival cuz you promised because what brought that plant back in the book of Joel the rain the former rain the teaching rain brought the life back up into that tree now the tree wasn't there he had to just rework itself because the member it came up into two shoots Luther Wesley was to stop pentecost was to shut and then we're looking at full seed now we're not looking at shuck we're not looking at stocks we're not looking at leaves we're looking at the fully matured grain alright that's our Bible now Luke tried a revival no doubt as we talked before there were cycles of revival that have happened even back you know when g20 zhis I say Jesus when Jesus stood out there in the middle of nowhere and said let there be that was a revival and that revival never waned we get back to that but that same power that's in him supposed to be a menu I said supposed to be but we limit it we limit it bad but where the carcass is the Eagles will gather you don't have to pump up a revival you don't have to pump up nothing only thing you have to do is just come to the fountain it's always full of good fresh water and there's no end to it it just keeps on bubbling all right let's go to number five that's the way you get a revival that's when you really get in the spirit of revival I'm saying again how many of you really want a revival I mean I want to real revival I want something to spark in my life where that you can see it Welsh revival policeman walking down the street where's the world for a Bible he said it's in me and if I paraphrase for a few minutes I'd be the guide say if you'll hang around a little while you'll see it it's in me it's when you're really getting in the spirit of revival not whooping it up sometimes or something but by praying it down so that's where the rain comes from it comes down until there's a revival strikes your heart until all the logs of ecclesia asks is them all the logs the fanaticism all the logs of systems all the logs of unbelief flow out then the waters of God comes falling down upon you there you are alright let's go to number six so we got to get to the get to the real meat of this in just a second all right now look third seal brother Brown said the bride let's read the whole thing now that's what the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring now remember in your you got to be careful in reading this because in your go back to the book of Joel that tree was brother Brown called it the restoration of the bride tree so that was a bride tree that was growing but what eat it down this right here denominational ISM eat it down the palmer worm cankerworm caterpillar and the locust all were what anti word because they eat at the truth okay that's what he's saying right here watch we've had denominational revivals but what did he do it could eat the tree it was doing a reverse effect but look it never was a word revival it never was a word revival it was just a revival of feeling good and being happy and sure there were some souls that came in and sure there was some healing and they was from different things and there's you some prayer clumps I just remember that and there was all these different things but it wasn't a word revival the only word revival were under now it's what the prophet of God brought us because it restored us back to the faith of the fathers nothing Luther never restored us back to anything except the just shall live by faith don't have to do penance we just have to live by the faith that God gives us in the Word of God but now here we are here at the end time we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring and I'm that's 1963 he just came out of the greatest revival healing revival that the world had ever known and he said no no no no he said it four times five times no no no no no sir what were see preaching he's preaching the seals there's for the revival was to begin when he said the Bible became a brand-new book in the opening of the seal that man was in and started a revival but it was a word revival you said while it looks so bad because you didn't have as many healing campaigns and people kicked him out of their denominations well that's what it'll do for me and you we were talking last night we we worry about and we do we worry about the things that are the external things that are happening around us but but I mean look Cain was Abel's biggest problem two brothers Judas was Jesus's biggest problem same church so don't think that the problem is gonna be out there no like I said before when we get a revelation of the two spirits in the framework of this church will become an invincible army why because we're weakened and that's not putting it toward any one person zero I'm not thinking of one person except the devil that weakens the true people sorry it just does it weakens the true people that's why I said several weeks ago thank God he's thinning the rains huh you know what when he thins them you don't blame nobody you know my brother Dale gets up and runs about half of y'all don't blame him blame the devil are you blame God I wouldn't do that but gods wanted spending this thing out God's the one that said hang on a minute let's let this thing mature and then I'm gonna send my angels and they're going to harvest and they're gonna cut down wheat and tares and then I'm going to divide them and one's going in one place and one's going in another but that's just the way it is folks we're we're looking maybe you looking for for the government to shut us down or or whatever but you know if they keep telling us that we can't have Church it's coming from our own rights the Baptist has never got up and stood and said well now the message churches they need to just go home and listen to tapes know if somebody from our own ranks the truth whether it's hurt your feathers or not it's the truth we're not being told by the denominational world that we need to shut the churches down and start listening to tapes it's by people in our own ranks and I'm sorry but I look we haven't oh we got millions and millions of church members but not a revival no where no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders as Bob was talking about the other night don't let that scare you that's just the full revelation of the book of redemption the thunders is what what we can understand that the world can understand how that God is real Aaron will saying how that God can take a human flesh change it from the inside out where the devil went into God's Eden and started from the outside really started from the inside but he couldn't get all the way into their soul because they were they were they had to hold a ghost in their soul but he worked on their emotion he worked on Eve's feelings he worked on her natural brain and got her to do what she did well now what's God doing he's using the same thing in Reverse he's bringing me and you to perfection and Satan's going no they're still looking oh I'm sure listen I'm sure Satan is not an idiot but he was standing there one day and he said if you be the Son of God cast yourself down if you be the Son of God turn these stone I know you're hungry turn these stones to bread I know you need something to eat and then that man looks at him and says Satan it's written what word the word is what Satan can't stand Jesus didn't reach and grab him and go no he just looked damn and he said I'm just telling you what the word says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word and I am sure that Jesus didn't have to holler jesus never hollered at a demon ever they hollered at him but he never hollered at a demon you don't have to scream it a demon demon scream out at you but you never have to holler it no demon if you got a little bit of this Dunamis we're talking about here we'll talk about that and say we're getting to it Brian hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival no manifestation to guard to stir the bride it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again wake her up remember even in in Matthew 25 they were all ten asleep ten wives the five wise and five foolish they were all they all had to be woke up but what happened the five wise had Dunamis they had the oil they had the power that they needed that when the bridegroom made the call they were able to walk into it and the ones that weren't did not have that Dunamis they didn't have the power to what oil their lamps to make their lamps cut on all right now look let's read this one more right here number seven that's the way God does he humiliates us in our educational system not as I'm trying to support ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the difference education can never bring life it takes the Spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just the intellectual revival now we've had some of them we've had some intellectual revivals but it's got to come out of the Bible word revival and that word is same yesterday today and forever and when it falls member scotf all got to come down when it falls today and quickens you get the same results than you did the book of Acts - exactly always has always will be because it's the Spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere that's what we were talking about last week it has to be a Holy Ghost atmosphere and it has to emanate from you because you know you can get you can get anointed by the Holy Ghost and still be lost but you can't be the Holy Ghost and be lost but you can be anointed by the Holy Ghost and be lost but you can't you if you condition the atmosphere now watch this right here number number eight pergamene church churches but God never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word that's when he lies I told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said - see that's the whole thing when we do as the word said then see results brother Brown says give them the word test well if you ever give yourself one if you ever give yourself forward test do you really believe what you believe ask yourself that question because watch said the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word is what energized by the spirit so that word the word like the word on the page is there but when it's energized or put in a Holy Ghost atmosphere or when something comes to give it a watch let's read this right here in John 14 jesus said if you love me keep my word is that okay can I'm not adding to her taken from because God's Word is the commandment if you love me keep my words but he didn't stop there because you can keep every one of the you can keep every one of the Ten Commandments as the rich young ruler did and have one thing wrong and remember what happened but now watch and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter so he's got to give you something beside the commandments he's got to give you something what is it and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever what is it the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive this world absolutely knows nothing about this they've lived under the egg socia power for a long time permitted power or power that God would anoint somebody to do something but Dunamis power is something the world doesn't know anything about even the five foolish virgins they were virgins but they had no Dunamis they had no power because their power would have took them in a rapture right they lived under axial Co though because they were virgins they were they run to the power of God to my people I'm telling you the truth even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because then understandeth him not that word see is not seen through your eyes it understandeth him not neither knoweth him remember Jesus told him he said the world see me no more but you'll see me how we seem we seem through the word but it's not just the word it's got to be a living word but you know him you know him here's the promise why do you know him because of that spirit of truth who I'm gonna give you to help you keep my Commandments right but you know him you know you can really it's okay you know somebody but when that somebody you know dwells inside of you that's still a big difference makes a lot of people knows of God but we supposed to be garden made manifest in another form excuse me neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you in you what the truth of the word equals power not just the word not just the word the word was power the truth of the word equals power because we're going to talk about this in just a minute when we take this transfer of power we're going to watch how Satan diluted it and made it what brother brown said we read it last night he makes the people cold formal and powerless no power all right John 14 let's read but these things have I spoken to you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost so surprised the comforter is the Holy Ghost okay doesn't tape doesn't take a revelation now it's written in there black and white well written in red but the comforter which the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things huh and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you what a promise John 16 verse 12 13 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now because you've been living under XOC a power you've been living up because when Jesus told them to go cast out Devils sure the power to cast out Devils with Dunamis but it was the authority God give them to do that through his power they had no power that he gave I give you he said I give you power to cast out Devils I give you what he gave them the power to do it howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth who the comforter who the Holy Ghost is come he will guide you into all truth now that River that's going to come out from under the throne there in the future home is not going to be impeded by anything it's just gonna be a flowing river right and you and I are gonna Bay to be able to enjoy the greatest water that we've ever drank but you know what we're drinking of it now if you don't have the live River of Life flowing out of you right now you got a problem but whatsoever he shall hear oh I'm sorry for he shall not speak of himself listen folks he's speaking of me and you John John 14 through John 17 God the Father is speaking through the son and he is transferring all the power to me and you oh I don't believe that well you you can be over there in that axle see a group you can just get in the norming and you'll still be here when the rapture takes place but he shall show you things to come so ever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he's not you say well now listen let's don't forget Jesus Christ no let's don't but I'm telling you what he said he has transferred that power that he had because we'll read in just a second that the power Jesus had was from the word that he spoke I read your scripture in just second okay everybody okay all right now watch let's read it one more time how be he when the spirit of truth is come he shall guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come listen you can't make the Holy Ghost speak error that's what he's talking about he's not he's gonna hear straight from God because He is God there's no double minded man that sent me in you were the only double minded people there is God's not double minded what he speaks the Holy Ghost hears and he gives it to me in you so now where is the problem in the transferring of power watch this let's go back then to our favorite book the book of Genesis and we look in the book of Genesis the tale was a man standing in creation and he said all he didn't say then but all power was in his hand there was nothing and he said let there be and folks let there be created universes just from the power that he had to create from nothing faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen by faith things were created that didn't have you know you and I used to well it's easy for us to to make this to make this organ here why because we know where to buy a plastic we know where to buy the metal we know where to get this we know where to get the reeds we know where to get the electrical panels and all these things we know how to do that God don't need that that man stood out somewhere in eternity and he said let there be and every element that's in that piano was created because it all comes from the earth everybody that comes from the earth right so let's watch the transfer of power we see this power it was given to a man named Adam to be ruler ruled the place don't bother me with it you take care of it you ruled this place because remember Adam had part of his daddy inside of him right he breathed the breath of eternal life and he became a living soul and there was Adam standing there with power and he was told that if this mountain needs to be moved or if this tree needs to be moved or if you need to move a river all you got to do is say it you don't have to go you ain't got to go have a conference he didn't have to look God up every 15 minutes that sound for me he doesn't have to go look up the preacher every 15 minutes Adam believed what God told him but we now we know what happened in the fall and during that fall God had to take some of that power back away from him because he could not as brother Aaron was talking about it takes a male and a female to have children but now it doesn't take a male and a female to have what Adam and Eve did to have children anybody got then everybody got that everybody stand up those of you that are sleep wake up stand up thank you brother boy just do this that just skips just this praise Lord just raise the Lord praise the Lord and that's stomp the devil and there you go sounds good and everybody good now just do you Nate like this alrighty now said back now we need some of that Dunamis and actual SIA open my board yeah so the permit but there was a permitted power though watch that power it never diminished the power of the Creator for Adam to do what he did did not diminish that Dunamis or any of that power that God had to create but what did God have to do God had to pull it back in because as we were talking last night if y'all thought about this that you've got in your in your soul right now you have the Creator that can create a world and go live on it inside of you today but the problem brother Brown said but there's your we're with he'll buy a bar what's the bar the bar is you the bar is your thoughts and your ideas because if God would give you that power you'd either say bad I and you'd go live on another world by your lonesome are that guy that pulled out in front of you tomorrow morning coming from coming from coming from Paoli the only Junction right there where everybody thinks the four-way stop is a two-way then you just go see you later see that's power without character that's what brother Aaron was talking about you have the power we're looking for the character we've got the power you got the Holy Ghost in you you got ahold you got the creator inside of you but it's so bound by you we're our own worst enemies but God's trying to tell us that he's pulling away all of these things he's given us virtue knowledge because remember when Jesus stepped on the earth listen when Jesus stepped on the earth and when they put him on the cross he literally have just destroyed the whole world with one finger listen what he thought in his mind he could have destroyed the whole world but he was so under subjection to that what was inside of him that Dunamis that power he did you don't think Jesus you know he looked he looked at piling policies I got power to to take you know I can just make this thing go away and Jesus said you don't have any power the power that I got you ain't never seen before I could call 10,000 legions of angels wipe this place off and I could just start all over again but you know Pilate didn't even take that as a threat he just looked at him and said okay all right I'm gonna let you go right he was wanting to let him go but he had to be crucified why for me and you to get that Dunamis power inside of us because it had not it had become the the power had transferred to xoc a power let me read the definition of the two and then that will help you as I'm talking Dunamis power is inherent power okay you have inherited power as brother Dan was talking about the the promise the promise was this Dunamis power inherent power power residing in a theme by virtue of its nature moral power and excellence of soul that sounds pretty good doesn't it but now if y'all would if you wouldn't mind skipping all the way down to to the other Greek lexicon Strong's number 18-49 X osya means power and authority it even means power of choice go to the sifting find the other members thank you XO see ya means authority sure it gives you authority and gives you the right to do things and the Liberty to do them he told Satan he said you have the Liberty to totally destroy job one thing you don't have enough power to take his life because that stands with me that was Dunamis but he gave him EXO SIA look power of choice liberty of doing as one pleases leave or permission physical and mental power listen Dunamis is not physical or mental power do you understand what I'm saying it's not Dunamis power is God's power it's God us having the mind of Christ is that we were talking about this is not the mind of Christ this is permitted power because that word ekklesia is the power in the Book of Revelations that was given in the fourth seal the power was given for that horse rider to do things he done he didn't have Dunamis power or he had the Holy Ghost he had excellency of power our authority are the right are the power of choice see Satan Satan doesn't have Dunamis power he has EXO SIA because he chose you know what he chose he chose that power over Dunamis power if he chose Dunamis power brother Brown City you've been our brother if he could get the Holy Ghost but he can't but he can have a power a permitted power or a power of choice are a power of authority there might get with the difference in the two the first one is an inherent power Romans 8 says were errors and joint heirs with God that makes us equal that is our inheritance our inheritance was not this it was the one that's inside they don't start a revival it's what's inside that's working its way out we have Dunamis power we got something Satan don't even have he can't have the power we have but we do give it to him we do give it to him alright where's my note all down through the Old Testament it was actual siap our David Haddix will see a power Samson had XO see a power they didn't have Dunamis sure it was that listen don't get me wrong it was the Holy Ghost anointing him but it couldn't go down and give them inherit power it could give them authority to do what they needed to do which was what now listen a sociopath is not bad it's bad if you keep it that way but when you receive Dunamis power it does away with EXO sia listen you and I got to realize something when we come to a place that we have Dunamis power which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the person remember all those sermons we preached on the I am that's where that person is that I am guy is inside of you [Applause] jesus said before Abraham was I am but it wasn't anybody else the Holy Ghost was not given in the Old Testament so there was actually a power there was power that would drop down it would anoint for a time now I didn't anoint Moses to kill an Egyptian you can't hang that on God but he had the authority to do what God said amen that's why I'm telling you that's why that the denominations are even Satan King have authority and you think it is Dunamis power because it's really close really close but one is an inherent one comes from right deep down inside the other one comes from on top of you and anoint you so the Old Testament had an anointing or a permitted power to do what they needed to do for a time but listen Dunamis power is not something to be given and taken away when you inherit something especially when you inherit from God he's not an Indian giver you don't give it to him take it back now he can give you XO sin take it back because he does it all the time he did it was the first horde Rider second horse riders he let him go to a certain point and stop he let Satan go to a certain point and stop but now with Dunamis power who stops Dunamis power you and I do you and I stopped that power listen more mercy not even got started good so the prophets were anointed now we know it was the power of God because what they spoke the power that we have now the Dunamis power is is energized by the word I just should read you the quote because you can't just and I love what God did because he's soul he's so wonderful he didn't just come out and go alright you and do whatever you want to do I'm gonna just give you power there's always the word the word even Jesus Christ who was Dunamis power he didn't receive it he hey was it he had to stay in the grave for a certain length of time amen he had to sleep he had to eat he had to do these things and his humanity that you would think well if he had Dunamis power but now remember there was a time when Jesus was telling the people different things that was going to happen Matthew I mean John 14 15 16 17 but in Matthew 28:18 Jesus came up and said all power I have now unlimited power because I am now body spirit and soul eternal that same spirit everybody get a surprised look on her face he's in you now Romans 8 says if the same spirit brother Nick's one of the brother dates favorite Scripture if the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body that's not EXO SIA though that's Dunamis that's coming from right down inside of here there will nobody will get a body change from EXO she'll call this power given and power for taking back power given but dunno Dunamis power we gotta realize this when God gave us that power he's not taking it back you know what he don't want it back he wants you to enjoy it they been okay with that he wants you to enjoy it but that transfer of power one day came back it was creative power in the beginning and then when Gabriel came to Mary and said Mary you're gonna be overshadowed by doing by Dunamis hey man you're gonna be overshadowed by the same Dunamis that created the world and I'm gonna create in you and the Bible calls it a thing uh-huh that thing conceived in you is conceived by the what Holy Ghost Dunamis but remember as we've spoken before brother berm tells us Mary wanton Dunamis she didn't have Dunamis power at the time she was just bringing a baby she was just an oven she was an incubator she was bringing the thing forth but what was born of her what's Dunamis power that was the man himself not a second person or third person if I okay with that but that creative power came to Mary and what happened is John 1:1 stepped into this dimension in the beginning was Word Word was with God the Word was God then John 14 and that Dunamis stepped into flesh and dwelt among us now what'd I tell you about that do you think about Jesus or you think about yourself that's the same way happened to you you walk around in flesh one day and we were doing of the flesh one day and the flesh was taking over all the things we were doing because we had a carnal nature the things we were doing we're not of God but when Dunamis power came in it's supposed to change you I said it's supposed to change you and turn you into a Christian all right let's look at this right here though that power then was transferred God worked we're like brother Aaron said God had to have you know God don't need anything and to me this shows the sovereignty of God more than anything God doesn't need us to survive he doesn't need us to do anything but he does need us to reproduce herself he does you said God don't need not no he doesn't but he does he decided in his plan he decided to need a female he decided to need a bride that he was not just going to have a bride and just leave her there no he said I'm not only gonna make a bride I'm gonna just step over in her and I'm going to destroy the effects of the devil and I'm gonna be standing up here right beside leaven we're gonna be talking side-by-side and all this is going on down here in the world and the Bride of Christ is just walking right into the word and Satan can't do anything about it because you can't have EXO see a power over Dunamis power amen so the transfer of power now has what it's Jesus here let me ask you a question is Jesus Christ here hold on it's Jesus costing human flesh here ah one more time as Jesus Christ in human flesh here well why don't we sit down here the physical Lord Jesus is not here you know that but watch what the scripture says in Matthew 26 verse 64 we'll get back to her our transfer of power though came when on the day of Pentecost that was the transfer of power God had held it he had walked on the earth for three and a half year or 30 years but three and a half years of ministry and then he leaves and he tells us all these great and wonderful things where'd he go jesus said unto Him thou have said nevertheless I say unto you hereafter shall you see the Son of man now the son of man is God in human flesh not son of God he said you shall see or understand where the son of man is going to be may I paraphrase ma'am is that okay is that not what that says I'm well let me read it the way it says it then for those of you that are doubters hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven we're living that we're living revelations 10:17 right but what are we seeing we're seeing the Son of man sitting on the right hand not brother BAM said it's not it's not the right hand but you know what it is it's a human man it's a human that once was a human mortal man it's standing in a dimension not this dimension but he has transferred all that power now if he kept it we don't have it exactly but on the day of Pentecost he took that right hand because what did he do when he brought that power or Dunamis on the day of Pentecost he transferred it to the last piece of the Gentiles it was going to get in there we know he's got to go the Jews but he's he delivered it on that day and Stephen when they stoned him what the world happened that dimension opened up before he got ready to die and he said I see Jesus standing on the right hand of God listen Stephen wasn't seeing it where he had to go to it he saw where it was at he saw he was in the throne room in his soul and when that dimension broke out he said that's where I'm going so he transferred the power to me and you know what says or a position that right hand of power we know that's a position all right real quick let's go to Matthew 28 let's read in Matthew 28:18 I think it's the next one Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power now he lied if that's not the truth all power in heaven earth all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth now when he goes to the right hand of power he should've kept it it was his Amen it was his but he had told him so many times that he's going to send something back let's read here in Luke 4 verse 32 now this is he's getting ready to ascend but what does he say watch this and behold I send the promise of my father unto you so he's telling him right then look I'm not keeping this I need you to have it because in my in John 17 he prayed that we would be one as he and the father were one and the only way you can do that is have Dunamis power cuz it's the same power all the way across listen the father don't have this much do know it's not a graph the father don't have this Dunamis power and Jesus had this much and we got this bunch all pirate Hitler has been given unto me he's got the full load but he takes that full load and he transfers it right down to me and you they meant cuz listen keep keep keep going remember keeping the back to your mind word revival word revival alright let's go to UM Luke I'm a missile in there let me get back over here let's go back you're all right Joe you're on your right okay what was look I will send the promise of my father what is that promise that was the promise that the Old Testament Saints couldn't get amen that's the promise of my father I'm going to send it not on a piece of paper I'm gonna set it in human beings and tarry in Jerusalem until you be endued with power are Dunamis from on high this is a good part if I can get get it all together here okay look let's go to acts 1 verse 7 and 8 I love the scripture of now watch and he's telling the limit is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father have put in his own power but you shall receive power now is that two different powers no that's not actually in Dunamis that's Dunamis all the way across but ye shall receive power after right that's why brother Brown said he said those denominations are cold formal and powerless without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are powerless against the devil but ye shall receive Dunamis after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me now what are they witnessing his word in Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the uttermost parts of the earth thank God that under most part said the United States of America well that's me and you but you shall receive power and that power is listening go to then you can go to them that's Dunamis power inherent power power residing anything by virtue of its nature now we having the nature of the devil Dunamis can't it get it and get in there we can have EXO Co though does it annoyance its Authority you can have you can have EXO see a power but you can't have Dunamis power unless it's inside of you inherent power power residing in the theme by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing what oh we're supposed to show it exerts and puts forth power for performing miracles moral power and excellence of soul how do we show it brother dick tell how you sure you sure by the Word of God you show it by what what you are because you remember you are the Word made flesh by Dunamis power he has transferred everything he said into me and you but still we limited by our own ideas just read Romans 13 verse 1 and 2 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers all right for there is no power but of God hmm even EXO sia permitted power comes from God because remember Satan has zero power zero because he can't reproduce himself he can't create you and I but our creators Oh Lord yeah whoo so therefore look the powers that be are ordained of God so there's you to power there's no power of God but there's powers that are a Dane of God listen Satan was ordained to do what he was supposed to do that's what the Bible says he had a job to do and God let him do it whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the or now watch the ordinance of God the word not the pots not the cleaning of this and not the sacrifice is the word the word is the ordinance so where do we get in trouble by resisting the word and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation boy pretty tough that's that's a mouthful all right let's go to Romans 1:16 Paul says now look where is this power for I am not ashamed of the gospel or word of Christ for it is the power it is the Dunamis of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greeks let's keep reading we'll get finished in a minute Luke 4 verse 32 watch what he says right here and they were astonished as at his doctrine for his word was with power everywhere he went that's why he never had to scream at a demon because he had Dunamis power there's a lot of XOC a power that tries to scream at demons and they ain't gonna move hello they're not gonna move but when you have denim's power when you walk up and and that's demon speaks to you and since what are you doing here why have you come to torment me before my time and they that's what's kind of weird you know it's really not weird but the devil at the Legion Jesus walks up to the Legion he had just he had just been in the temple in Jerusalem and they called him a devil they called the Son of God or devil right belzebub now he walks in front of a demon legion and the first thing leads and says why are you the son of God now you're here you're not supposed to be here until the devil knew he was the son of God and the people that was supposed to bend the religious people in the world calling him a devil how weird for his word was with power 1st corinthians 1 verse 18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us take that finger now and do that and be happy about it and to us which are saved it is the Dunamis of God 1st Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us begotten us children begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead there's your two an inheritance the Dunamis power to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you now you say it's reserved in heaven if we're sitting in heavenly places were right in the middle of it we're on the middle of it who are kept by the power of Dunamis power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed today the right right in you now you can take that thing and do the same thing goes listen the full revelation is not till now this is the full revelation of that Dunamis power because remember that Dunamis power is so powerful it creates worlds and it changed Jesus's body but it hasn't changed nobody's body but it has been limited by the word that they've held but now we have no excuse for words been given so in Revelations 8 let's read just for a minute here go back to XOC revelation 6 verse 8 says I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given now that power in the Bible is Exodia our authority or power of choice our physical and mental power the ability of strength which one is in dude right so Pyle was given you look through all the Book of Revelations power was given power was given power was given power was given power was given he doesn't talk that about Jesus and didn't talk talked about the bride that's the devil that's given power if you're born again you have the power power is not being given to us folks if you're born again you have the power inside of you already to create a world and go live on I look at Romans 1 verse 24 the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen how much more in the end time being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power us thinking about this when I read that scripture listen his power would the only thing you and I can think of in power wise is something has to generate it and it ends and flows it goes up it goes down it goes up you have a lot of power in the battery and then all of a sudden you can use the battery and then you have no more power you have to do something to give it more power this you don't when he created the world that set in motion everything to look at the future home what is God's gonna you know we're not gonna have to rebuild stuff in the future home now we may in a millennium because that's not all Dunamis power we're gonna have it but the world's not gonna have it but in the future home everything has it and we're not gonna have to rebuild and cut down trees and I don't know how that's gonna work but you know what we're not gonna be crowded we're not gonna have to have a mechanic or a HVAC guy or that's what Dunamis power is folks it's unlimited power unlimited it's only limited by the Word of God and you even his eternal power and Godhead and when I was reading this a little light came on because look see what kind of power you got when you have the Godhead right that's why the prophet of God had to come in in time to give us the correct interpretation of the Godhead because Father Son Holy Ghost has no Dunamis power it has that socio power Dunamis power remember brother Brown said I just want to see how this would work he said in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost talk to that demon and head the table up off the ground and all that stuff you know he said in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he said he'd never move why that was xoc a power that was just a given power but when he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said leave this room that table he said hit the ground well we had to God we got the Godhead right that's my brother Brahma is it's it's it's very powerful what he says and sometimes you don't understand if a brother Brown said that doctrine came from the pits of hell the Father Son Holy Ghost doctrine came from the pits of hell it never was a doctrine created by God it was not ever never had any Dunamis power now look even though it was written in the word it was hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed to babe such as will learn Philippians 3 verse 10 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness I'm almost finished which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the Dunamis of his resurrection listen you can't that's why even though the foolish virgin is anointed by XOC of power our could be even anointed by Dunamis power anointed because they're virgins it never resided in them and it can't bring them out of her in a resurrection Dunamis power will bring you out of the ground hexose their power will not bring you out of the ground doesn't have enough power because Satan can't resurrect Satan do a lot of things but he only does it because God permits the power for him to do it then I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death all right look second Timothy 1:7 through 10 then I'm going to read you two quotes and we'll be done then we'll take communion in foot washing for God hath not given us this is brother Ernie's favorite scripture I guess you'll probably hear it Sunday don't stand up and say we've already heard that for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of Dunamis pop that power not exosphere power Dunamis power and of love and of a sound mind be not there therefore ashamed of the testimony what of the word of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God so the gospel is what has the power of God that's why we're looking for a word revival God will only come back in Dunamis power not EXO SIL and where is Dunamis power is not in the leaves it's not in the trees it's not in the bench or setting in it's in you there's not even Dunamis power in that Bible anything that's words but if you got doing too much power in you you'll know what to read to feed that word to feed that power with who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus when before the world began we can t lose two quotes let's read the last two across the mystery of God revealed in the end time seat sign we read him a couple of Sundays ago but I think we're gonna read again cuz watch mm-hmm and let me let me set the stage here God is it's waiting on us all right that's brother Dale Sam but the reason he's waiting on us because he's waiting on us he's not waiting on itself through a prophet some 60 almost years ago 57 years ago now he spoke this about you there's no Dunamis power out here now the Dunamis power it's not in a denomination I've told y'all before the the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is only in the elect lady in the end time does everybody understand that say ma'am only in us look God in his body Christ and Christ in his by look God put the power in Christ Dunamis power Christ takes the Dunamis power and gives it to us the bride oh oh oh my God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed no sir but she is coming back with the pure unadulterated Word of God being manifest I hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that see she is the second e but she is not breaking and spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband in other words she's not working under XOC of power at all zero listen if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost this revival that we're talking about it's not EXO see a power coming to Dunamis power you can't bring lower power and make higher power work it's just knowing that what you've got already it's already in the bank start drawing the dividends she'll stay with his word regardless of what anybody says you can have all the ecumenical moves you want to and all the affiliations let's read the last one in time seed signed Tifton Georgia and I believe that these latter-day signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together to show that Christ is ready to come for his bride as God in His Word made manifest in a man a perfect man all right everybody got that a perfect man so is God and His Word coming and making an imperfect bride huh Oh God and His Word made manifest in a man a perfect man that same Dunamis power is God in His Word coming again and making himself manifest in a bride not will do like Eve did highbreed it to something else but the unadulterated Word of God will be born into that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did with his spirit anointing in his word amen I believe it is the announcement now I've been let me read that again I believe it's the announcement now it took a prophet to bring it but she takes me and you to believe it the standard fee so what are we looking for yes good to have h socia but that won't get you our grave right that won't change your body but Dunamis power will do that it will bring you out I promise you cuz it you know what it done it brought Jesus out of a grave and now what's it gonna do he says all powered heaven earth been given unto me and now I'm transferring that power to them last two quotes to the bride everybody got that same n-word revival the word back in power alright the brothers come on you won't do them and while we're can't get it in the water baptism scripture um while we're raw we've got everything ready while we're waiting let's just bow our heads if you got a need in your heart and if you got a sickness in your body today we look to the Word of God we look to the promise that God has promised us so if you got a need just raise your hand I know we all do we all have needs and we we've all got people that are running through our mind right now that need prayer that need salvation that need healing well you know what you can't go by that Dunamis power it's already inside of you you don't have to work it up brother Branham says you got to bring it down so they don't the word that you already are if you're born again today you're the word you're the word made flesh you just need a revival of what's already inside of you so let's pray for a minute do you have any father thank you for this day all of us that standing here in this building Lord we all have needs we all have family in the members that need salvation we all have somebody and on our heart that needs healing Lord we still are needy people even though you've give us this power Lord let us let us release that power let us not Dam it up like man has took these beautiful rivers around here and put downs and dammed them up and kept them from flowing free Lord the river of life won't have a dam in it the River of Life won't have a place where it narrows and is clogged up and oh that's what's happening now by our unbelief but Lord it will flow freely I pray that you'll give us right now a little taste of that future home that you'll give us Lord a little taste of where we're about to go to father that there's something right on the brink of happening I just believe Lord where we've entered in a new decade this is 2020 I don't believe in my heart we'll see 2030 I believe that this is the decade of us going home we're going to leave this place Lord and we pray father that the ones that do not have this Dunamis power that Lord that you will just stir their heart and Lord just be that balm in Gilead that that we have many needs of maybe hurt feelings and different things Lord you you said you wouldn't leave us comfortless that you would come to us father forgive us of our sins as we're about to partake of this communion it's a true representation Lord that we're a part of you and that we're gonna commune with you now not just for a few minutes this is just a symbol that we're already communing with you in the days and weeks ahead Lord may we commune more may we cut out the things that we don't need and spend more time with you Lord because you're the one with the Dunamis power and it will never ever lose its strength what a promise man is tried for centuries Lord to create power they've done it by different things and and and in damming up rivers and and turning turbines and spending billions of dollars and solar panels to create electricity and all you do is just walk out and say my powers in my word Dunamis power Lord may we receive it today give us this day truly our daily bread amen let's read the scripture first Corinthians 4 I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the manner also he took the cup which he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament you see the New Testament the Old Testament wasn't anointing that God would anoint a group of people and then they would come off home and no but this but the New Testament is in his blood the New Testament is in the life that he was going to send back 11 days later twelve thirteen days later on the day of Pentecost when he was speaking this right here this cup is the New Testament that's why we've always said you were so dogmatic about it and I guess we are the New Testament didn't start until after Jesus died he had to die he just said right here the cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it right and remembrance of me so every time we drink it we remember that he gave his life and that life didn't just go somewhere and stay he came right back down here into this dimension again as the Holy Ghost out into his full into the believers as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come where so wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself if you have a problem today you need to examine yourself right now we'll stop in a few minutes and have a silent word of Prayer you pray for the pastor and you pray that if you've got something in your life that God will wipe it out anybody would he said he would but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily this and drink the damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body now who's the Lord's body you an hour right for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged if we would judge ourselves we will not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren you see how we've been separated we're not gonna be condemned by the Lord with the world because that Dunamis power overcomes everything Jesus said I have overcome the world what do you say it with he said it was Dunamis power the same power you got inside of you wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest wants it in order when I come let's just have a moment of silent prayer praying for the pastor praying for if you have anything in your life that you need to get rid of now it's a real good time to get rid of it so let's bow our heads
