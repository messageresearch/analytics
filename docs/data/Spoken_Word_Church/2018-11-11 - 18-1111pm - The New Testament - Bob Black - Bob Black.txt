the New Testament for field everybody feeling good this afternoon my goodness this church is blessed we got singers I appreciate that singing now that hey anybody anybody should be able to come on sing after well it was it Micah that said bring me a minstrel and let me prophesy and I appreciate I appreciate everything everybody does just wonderful group of people I love y'all we just saw one big body right let's go to Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 and then I'm gonna read from Luke chapter 22 Lord of God we're just so grateful to be able to come together in your presence again or to having eaten with the natural food Lord now I already come and sit down at the table just sup with you and dine at your table Lord and we invite you in Lord Jesus that you would come in and itself with us Lord the Lord we're so grateful to you to be able to have something to eat Lord and you said when you were here on earth I am that bread of life that came down from God out of heaven I am that manner and now we have that manna to eat eat from again and this last day that full bread of life without any of man's carnal ideas anything added to it we've got that manner that came down in this last day to fulfill your word now look God I pray Lord that you'll just come among us now Lord Jesus Lord because what kind of service would it be here Lord if if you weren't invited if your spirit wasn't here to quicken the word to make it come alive to us Lord Jesus now could we even approach to understand these mysteries and these things Lord God without you to quicken it Lord to us and so we ask you Lord God to come and feel welcome among us Lord Jesus that we will really have a real church tonight that will really have a see the New Testament really fulfilled in our myths Lord because that's what we're all we're all waiting and looking to see the manifestation of the sons of God now Lord let it come to pass we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now I believe we read this this morning to Revelation 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me excuse me and then Luke 22 14 kind of goes along with that talking about talking about supping and when the hour was come he sat down and the Twelve Apostles with him starting at verse 14 and he said unto them with desire I have are to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for I say to you I will not drink of the board of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come which means that he embody is about to leave the scene and they didn't know that yet his body's leaving but somebody's gotta fulfill the work and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this cup is the New Testament in my blood and that symbolize right there at that moment that symbolized kind of a ending to the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament and you know that's that what is the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament that has caused a lot of confusion and a lot of people's minds about the beginning at the end of the Old Testament where exactly that ended I know a lot of times when you know you hear brother Dale or brother Wade or whoever saying that the New Testament began in the book of Acts not the book of Matthew and that begins to cause confusion in people's minds you know you begin to wonder or what or why don't why when I open my Bible does it say in great big old bold words new Testament right before the book of Matthew but yet it said that the book of the New Testament the New Testament begins in the book of Acts and so maybe I want to speak on that this morning because you see the New Testament is supposed to be fulfilled if you if you go back and listen in the into the to the sermon who is this Melchizedek brother Bentham talks about that difference and who fulfilled the Old Testament and who fulfills the New Testament now as Christ don't get me wrong as Christ Christ fulfilling there's nothing that we could do in our own cells of our own works to fulfill anything you can't what make one hair your head white or black or do anything you can't add one stature it's not our works with so many times we think or I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that but yet it's Christ living on the inside of us so we we want to see III I really want to kind of think about what if the New Testaments gonna be fulfilled by the bride by God living in the bride let's put it like that because Jesus there right there he said I'll not drink of this fruit of the vine until that everything is too fulfilled until the whole plan is is worked out so his body is not here anymore so now he has to use your body he has to use your hands and your eyes and your lips and your feet to move and to do to preach the gospel to live the gospel all of those things and of course that's what I was preaching on this morning is that's what kind of boggles our mind that he would use my hands and my feet and and even after the new birth it begins you kind of stumble over the fact that God Himself is dwelling on the inside of you and it takes a little while to begin to realize that what that means and you know the all of these scriptures all of these things that are in the Bible they testify of something that's got to be fulfilled and there's got to be somebody that can believe it and can receive it and fulfill it and to really like I was talking about this morning to really have an understanding of how it's supposed to work out how it works you must eat from the body flesh of the son of man which is what what Jesus was just doing there as a type in the communion as a type of our fellowship with him we eat the word we the spirit quickens in it and it gives us a stimulation of Revelation I believe in a stimulation of Revelation I believe when you get a revelation it the word live inside of you it'll make it'll make you do more than just hop around a little bit it'll make that word walk and talk with inside of you because it's God living so think about think about that the New Testament you know a lot of times we we kind of get in our here that the the woman is it's kind of something to be looked down on and everything and and you know over the years you've heard preachers preaching down on women and everything but really if you look at it scripturally the Bible God is is is is actually he's putting his glory into the woman and because of that because he puts his glory into the woman he's making her almost appear greater than himself doesn't the Bible say greater works than these shall you do greater works you remember brother Branham always talking about how that you go out in the barnyard and look at the rooster and the rooster looks better it looks it's got all the fancy colors and things than the little hand you know looking at my wife it likes to watch birds and everything and you see a bird come to the feeder and you can tell us whether it's a male or female because the male always looks you know it's full you know the feathers and everything a more colorful and brighter and everything and look at the line with this great big mane and everything and the little the little it's a little wife but yet God seemingly does it in Reverse he comes in humility and meekness and he puts his glory you know even at a wedding you see the man standing up there with his tuxedo and down comes to that down the aisle comes the bride adorned in a white dress she's typing now how she's supposed to be clothed in the word how she's supposed to be coming clothes and virtue with virtue that the groom spiritually speaking the groom has given to her because she has received his word and now she's clothed in the right way and she's veiled because the words got too veiled until it's revealed the word is veiled and she comes down that aisle like as though almost greater than he is but the reason she looks that way and the reason that is is because God has taken his glory his majesty and put it inside of her and so that's what God has done in the New Testament he came down and meekness and humility like the song that we're singing and a manger born in a manger and and then he takes that humility dies on the cross let him let some beat him and and smite him on the cheek spit in his face so that he can put that glory in you and that's what that means when he said take this cup this is the New Testament in my blood I'm gonna put my life inside of you I'm gonna put my life in you and make you something take you from this world that you were in take you out of the thing the car knows the the carnage and the carnality and all the enmity and strife and everything and make something that's glorious and you see that's what that's what God the whole if you go back to Genesis that's where that's where Eve messed up you say maybe maybe another kind of underlying topic I wanna I want to preach on is that is that the God's gonna have something to fulfill his word when the word goes out and it's received and it's received in fertile ground it tilled up ground a good ground ground that can get this going to produce something it will produce if you want to go all the way back God began to speak and he said let there be light and he took the the world through these different stages as he was moving on up let there being when he said let there be let there be light there was light because the word the word spoken is going to manifest now what are you talking about brother Bob I'm talking about all of this the word spoken is gonna manifest the word spoken at the capstone is gonna manifest something if you believe if you receive that son of man revelation it will manifest if so did a good ground it will manifest when God said let there be plant life up from the ground came plant life because it's going to manifest the Word of God will produce it will fulfill when he began to put the Sun and the and the moon into the sky typifying the god and his bride it would manifested and everything began to move exactly in the place and then one day at the culmination he began to speak and he spoke let there be and a man came forth from the earth through time said and his foot was stuck in the ground and we under we've read all those things about how he was that he was made from the dust and then God breathed into his life he put he put a soul into him and then he breathed into him eternal life and gave him eternal life so that he could walk around the garden and God's Word was fulfilled his word was fulfilled that man began to walk around in the garden hey and he asked you know he paraded in front of that man all the different kind of creatures and things what kind of wife would you like to have and do you find a wife in any of these different kind of creatures any of the beasts of the field and all that kind of stuff and he said I can't find anything like that that matches what I am I need I just can't find what I'm looking for you know that that was a voice speaking I don't find something there's something missing here and so God put him to sleep and pulled out of his side took out of his side just like how he does the bride he the bride is created from part of God that's God coming into reality and so so he put him to sleep and and made the woman from that rib of Adam and so then after Adam woke up then he said she is flesh of my flesh bone of my bone the same maker the same thing and he had he had a it's what I'm getting it is the New Testament bride is going to fulfill where Eve lost often where she she couldn't keep going you see when Eve just believed God's Word it just kind of stopped the progress that God was trying to make in her he was trying to fulfill her work then fulfill his word in her what is the woman's purpose the woman's purpose is to receive the word I'm talking spiritual a now to receive the word and produce it to receive it and produce it and so Eve failed to receive the word she failed to go on with it and so she failed to produce it instead of receiving the word she received the eat the devil's lie in the womb of her mind and then it produced in her natural wound you see and that's the same thing that's happening today this happened this for the last all through the seven churches that that people receive the devil's lie in the womb of their mind and it produces something incorrect but what God is trying to do is he's trying to produce a wife he's trying to get his wife into a position well she would receive all of the word and then produce all of the word fulfill all of the word you say will it produce in Matthew 13 Jesus said he gave them this parable and he put forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed a grain an insignificant little grain of mustard seed that you sow into the ground he said which a man took and sowed in his field which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it has grown it is greatest among herbs and becometh the tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge and the branches thereof so if you take this little grain of mustard seed faith that you just start off with because brother Branham said when you get the new birth it's like a little speck of light down on the inside of you a little tiny little speck if you just keep feeding it and let it grow it'll blossom out into a great tree into a great big bride tree and of course we know the story of the bride treat the bride tree was here and down by man's cardinalities by man's ideas say here I go I'm just i'ma throw it out tonight it was it was here down to the stump and the Dark Ages not all the way down down to the stump because the stump is where the life goes in the in the middle of the winter or whatever it runs down into the stump so the stump was always there the foundation the foundation of faith it was cut down all the way to that and and what did they loosen it and they lost the doctrine the bark they lost the leaf sir their fellowship and their their joy and they lost all those things that was hewn down but the Bible says and Joel and I will restore saith the Lord I'm gonna restore this tree all the way back up so that it will be the fulfillment of the New Testament this tree God's fulfilling his life in the New Testament and then you can see the New Testament fulfilled but you know you don't kick you can't really see how the New Testaments gonna be fulfilled until you see how the Old Testament was fulfilled because the Bible runs in cycles it runs in a cycle like this morning we were talking about the three pools how Abraham Noah Moses all of the ones that Brent talked about Jesus their life ran in three pools and so your life is gonna run it in three pools the message running runs in three pools well this Bible runs in cycles and you can see how that you can see the New Testament cycle by looking at the Old Testament cycle how it began how it started and how it ends because you know brother Graham said that even in the Old Testament had seven church ages he didn't lay them out exactly how everything was but the Old Testament ends just like how the New Testament ends the Old Testament ends with a prophet coming on the scenes he introduced what to introduce the Son of Man and he preached a message John the Baptist preached a message to clear the way to make the the high places low and the low places high to clear it way for the introduction of the Son of Man well that's the same thing that's happened in the New Testament in the New Testament God's Word is being fulfilled and he a prophet comes upon the scene and he preaches a message to get everything ready to make the way clear for the for for the son of man but in this case the son of man is not going to be an individual it's going to be a New Testament fulfilling God in his bride fulfilling the New Testament hey you know you think about this morning now you say that the the son of man was put out of the church and we all may be maybe there's some of the young ones or whatever get in there mind that the son of man has put out of the church and it looks like an actual man standing there with with a robe on and a crown like that painting was painted but what it is is when the Son of Man is put out of the church it's those ideas that I that they put him out because they accept their carnality their carnal ideas and the way that their their tradition of the elders the tradition of their church and they put out the revelation of the Son of Man but the revelation of the Son of Man will be accepted by the bride because she is the new Testament fulfilled and I'm kind of really honestly this this evening I'm kind of mixing up a lot of different sermons that brother Branham preached like the token and who is this milk is a dick and Christ the mystery of God revealed because to really see the New Testament it involves it involves blood it involves something Christ did and so you know when Eve there when she when she just believed God's Word the remedy for that was a blood offering and we're talking about a token now just so you can follow me their token the token was given a token offering the token was the blood and in the Old Testament that token was the chemical makeup of the blood the chemist the chemistry where you can see when they left the Garden of Eden they were covered by that blood but the life in that blood could not come back up on the believer because it was it didn't have a soul there was no soul to come back on the believer and and accomplish the redemptive purpose but in the New Testament there is a token where the life can actually come back on the believer and that life that token has to be applied when the children of Israel were leaving Egypt that token had to be over the door it had to be it had to be visible so that so that anybody could see it and that's the same way with you and I we cannot just just put this message kind of over here or whatever we we actually have to eat it just like they ate it and then it becomes lived in us and you can see that blood speaking out through your life and you become a lived and then that token identifies you because the token is over you the token is as it represents the the payment already made it represents that death no more has a prior no more has any anything to do with you let's put it like that yeah death death has been defeated death has been conquered and so so in Jesus when he think about this now he said this cup is the New Testament in my blood and he gave that then to them as a representative of the blood that he was about to shed that night on the next day the next morning on the cross as they took him that night and his life would be shared but it's not the chemical that saves you it's the life that he shared the life that comes back inside of the believer that tokin life has to be represented in you and that is the New Testament fulfilled let's look at the Old Testament here I know I'm sometimes it gets a little bit confusing when you start talking about a lot of different things and mixing things I'm thinking think about now I'm mixing up who who was this milk isn't it who is this milk you know brother Brian priest who is no kids Deckard I forget the exact name of the title and then later on he preached who is this milk is a dead now now you've got a Melchizedek in the Old Testament and there's no kids that reveals himself again in the New Testament and really the only way that you can know who is this milk is a dick because something I can tell you who is this milk you take some I can't you know you know tell you what the message says and everything but I do you really know who is this Melchizedek the only way that you can know is to go on the same journey that that Melchizedek went and to experience that same thing and have his life living inside of you that takes you on that journey so let's take that journey now now in the Old Testament Adam and Eve walking in the Garden of Eden they were veiled behind this you kind of glory they were veiled behind the word and so the word all brother I'm talked to over and over the interval many many times about how the word has got to be veiled it's veiled and so they were the living word walking through the Garden of Eden and then then when they stepped out from behind that and accepted a lie then that veil was lifted you see and all of a sudden they realized that they were naked and and so you know the the word is always veiled when when Abraham met Melchizedek and paid tithes in him and it says that Levi paid tithes even while he was still in the loins of Abraham he paid tithes to Melchizedek God that was God veiled in flesh he was veiled behind a human flesh God Himself walking in that man and when he left the scene he did this you know that the body that he had just went back to the elements or whatever but yet that was God Himself tabernacling inside of human flesh and he was veiled he was veiled in the behind the holy of holies back there with that pillar of fire came down where the word was he was veiled and didn't then one day he became veiled in human flesh and he went and died for you and I and died on the cross and gave up his life and went through the journey of that you and I you and I must take of death to self death burial and resurrection the journey that we also must go through where you die to yourself you die to your own desires you go down in the grave and you come up again a new person which is why we go when we baptized somebody we read that scripture that just as Jesus was died and went down into the grave and rose up so we burry this person in water as a type of that but really what's happening is when you get born again that's why I don't believe it like the Baptist said just believe and make it a decision but I believe that when you come to the Lord and he births himself into you it is a birth you are dying out and something a resurrected life is coming out but but but what about what about these other journeys all of this is a dying out to yourself I dine out until finally the word is because this is all a birth and finally the word is born in you just like it was when when just there at the very end of the Old Testament when when the angel came to Mary and told her that she was gonna have this child this child the son of man he was going to come into being and the angel told her and she said be it unto me according to thy word and marrying a brother around this is another thing that's always confused people that that that brother Branham talked to Mary as the carrier she just carried him but then the word was born the son of man was born she carried the word just like he came through a lot of the denominations she carried as he was carried along but then at the end he was born the son of man was born and you can see the son of man walking around veiled in human flesh and they didn't recognize him they didn't recognize God veiled any human flesh but he was there to do what to fulfill the Old Testament to fill fulfill all the things in the Old Testament that had been prophesied about him because all of those prophecies about he would be born in Bethlehem and how he would be born of a virgin and all those things when he was there and fulfilled everything that people had pondered about about who who would be who who would this person be that would give birth to him and He fulfilled over 400 Old Testament prophecies in the Old Testament until when he got to the River Jordan he told John in Matthew 3:14 this is John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comes down to me and Jesus answering said unto them suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness a little bit of the righteousness a little bit of the rightness note everything everything that was prophesied of him in the Old Testament he was gonna fulfill he was gonna make it live another way to saying and so within it then it says and then he suffered him and he he knew he knew who he was and so he knew the role that he had to fulfill and that's why when that Sarah Phoenician woman called him thou son of David he didn't answer her he said he answered her not because he knew he was he knew the dispensation in the hour that he was living in that he didn't it wasn't time for the son of David to be fulfilled it was the time for the Son of Man to be fulfilled and so and all these other scriptures like Matthew 5:7 - 1718 this says and think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled and then Luke 1250 but I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straight until it be accomplished his baptism being his death he had something that he was supposed to do to be fulfilled and in Matthew 26 that where it says then it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples you know that after two days is the Feast of the Passover and the Son of Man is betrayed to be crucified and I just want you to think is I know maybe this could this it can be a little bit tiring as I listen to all the scriptures and things quoted rattled off but think about this now the Word of God received into your heart will produce something it will predict it will bring forth something if you open up your heart and I believe in this hour we should be opening up to the point where we just spend practically all of our time in it and I don't want to overly burden anybody but I believe now is the time to be feasting on the body word of the son of man and to be dedicating our whole if that if this is what's gonna change us then what else do I have to occupy my time with I certainly don't need to be occupying my time with the movies and TV shows and that kind of thing that's not gonna change me all that will do is take me down into the ground and so what we should be doing is giving our whole being our whole effort everything to be consecrated to be completely given over to the eating this body word and so so one of the things that Jesus did was as he was fulfilling the word as he was showing that what had been planted by the prophets all down through the ages he was now the fulfillment of that he began to sow also he began to sue and the Bible says that and he spake many things unto them and this this is Matthew 13 and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow of course they didn't understand who the sower was but he later explained to them that this sower was the son of man this man right here who was veiled in flesh this sower began to sow and for three-and-a-half years he began to speak and he began to sow words what was he so and he was sowing you and I because one day you would hear the words that he sowed not the exact words not that through his same vocal cords but you would receive it and you would be the manifestation of those words that he spoke spake during that three and a half years now how does that how do those words get to you they've been passed down through generations to generation written on pages preached and preached preached by the gospel until they finally make their way to you but all of these words all of this the true preaching of the gospel came from this sowing of the Son of Man the Son of man showed you he sowed you because it says the sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured him up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the Sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold who hath ears to hear let him hear and so the amount of the of the fruit that is born depends on how much you blend it with with carnal ideas because down brother Branham explains it I'll read this in a second you can see how they're through through the different church ages these the Catholic system and the Methodist system and all of that choked out the word so that it couldn't bring forth as much as it should it couldn't bring forth but now in this age we're supposed to be bringing forth a hundredfold a hundredfold is the full word where where you can understand like I said this morning you could understand from Genesis to Revelation there should be no none of man's idea well the green is being baked out now there might still be some of man's ideas left but it's being baked out and the shuck is pulling away until all this left is that corn of wheat the corn of wheat the original corn of wheat that was sown back here in the first church age which was the son of man cuz the son of man was sown and the son of man sowed the son of man was playing him and the son of man is gonna come up in this last day and so you see two cycles there two cycles that in the end of the Old Testament age the son of man would fulfill all the Old Testament Scriptures but in the end of the Old Testament age the Son of Man would be back again to fulfill all of the New Testament Scriptures and how is he going to do it is he gonna do it by coming himself in bodily flesh no he's gonna use your flesh that's why brother Brennan said that he's looking for somebody who he can get inside of that he could use their mouth that he can use their hands and feet and walk through and talk through he's looking for somebody that will give themselves completely over to God some people will give themselves a little bit partly to God and they you know honestly they can't quite make it up here they can't quite make it up because they can't get moved pastors additions can't move past maybe their laziness can't move past there their desire for for just slacking off or whatever but uh let's be honest here now but a real true cause if you want to eat the body were the son of man you can't you can't just lay around and expect somebody to spoon feed it to you you got to go digging for it yourself like that that I believe that was a vision that brother Branham had one of the the seven or so visions that kind of led up to the seals and in one of those that he maybe it was a dream he dreamed that there were cows or some sort of animal on the side and they were they were digging in that grass trying to find that food and he said the interpretation of that was it's hard to get that food and you have to go finding it sometimes and you have to get into this message and really go hunting and finding and seek him to figure out what is what is the revelation of who is this Melchizedek is what that preacher man is saying is that true is he telling me the right thing or am I just going to say well I don't believe that I'm just going about my business yeah but you see that's that's that's the way a real true New Testament believer I believe is gonna do is it's gonna search the scripture daily like the brands and find out whether the three things that are preached about are true or not let me see if I can read that that quote this is in wisdom versus space and I don't think I gave this to you brother sorry I I added some between services wisdom versus faith he said notice he said some went forth went to seed when the scene went forth preached the word some fell by the wayside just like water on a duck's back runs off some fell upon rocky ground stony it had just little dust that blowed up there and sprung up but it didn't have no roots no place to put its roots now I'm going to make illustrations here and I hope I don't hurt no feelings see that was the Catholic Church they said they was built on a rock I agree with him I'll sure will agree with him that's right no earth under it at all no water on it to grow from why it couldn't produce they couldn't produce a Bible vitamin because they don't even believe in it their doctrine is dogmas that's right Roman Dogma no word in it at all see fell upon rocks that was a super wisdom old brother I'm telling you they had it in a super way they presented in a way of psychology and great big buildings and find risks look like holy gods of priests and everything else that's the one that fell upon rocks just so little of soul till the thing couldn't grow it died then that was super wisdom then some fell on the Protestants ground but after a while the great wisdom of the big denominations choked it out choke the spirit out days of miracles has passed dr. so-and-so said so and so see no such a thing just perfect choked all choked all the what out choked out the spirit for the wisdom see the Holy Spirit fell and the days of Martin Luther the Holy Spirit fell in the days of John Wesley the Holy Spirit fell on the days of the early Pentecostal church but what's the denominations done with their wisdom have choked it out choked out what the seed what is the seed the word it doesn't mean that it means this there see see how it does when you begin to question and say it doesn't mean that then then it prevents it does just like you did it prevents the Word of God from being fulfilled but if you open up your heart and say it does mean that he's still Jehovah Jireh he's still able to provide he's still my healer he's able to heal my brother Graham said talking about I'm gonna jump back to that sermon from this morning he said if you've got the key of faith to open up the door then it'll unlock all of sickness all of the any kind of illness he ran through there was a quote I meant to read this morning where he ran through all the different kind of things if they like it'll unlock and when you get that door that key or the door of a son of man it'll unlock all of these things I believe I believe that's where we're coming so - so brother Branham so Jesus went through went through this journey that the believer has to be identified with he went through the journey of going down to the cross and and and dying and rising again and then you could see the resurrection come to live inside of him but what is it the believer to believe her today the New Testament or the believer all down through the New Testament is the fulfillment of Scripture the fulfillment of all the things that had been spoken of beginning I'm trying to get some of the scripture so when Jesus was about to go off the scene he told them in John 14 12 verse 12 through 18 he said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and you know that's maybe sometimes hard for us to understand greater works greater not not fancier or more magnificent works of with more fireworks or anything but greater because now he's putting that same life that was in one man inside of a group of believers that are scattered around the world and you look at this in the same way that maybe you can go back to some of these Old Testament stories of like Elijah and Elijah where Elijah when he was called by Elijah he was plowing that twelfth mute that twelve oxen and and Elijah Elijah cast his mantle on him he puts his mantle on him and it's like a token to him their anointing of the Holy Spirit falls upon him so you can see at the beginning of the church age God gives he puts his beginning of the church ages he puts his life inside of the believers he gives them a token in the message the token brother Graham said the token was given on the day of Pentecost but later on he says the token could not come until this day that sounds very confusing what does he mean when the token could not come until this day because that you've got this the same kind of cycle that was revealed in the life of Elijah and Elijah Elijah had a mantle cast on him when he was first called when he was first called but then you wait till the end of the road after he's going through Gilgal and Bethel and a gill gal the school of the prophets and Bethel and then as they after he watches Elijah who types Jesus cross over the River Jordan cross over death and and ascend up into the heavens on the fiery chariot then that mantle falls back on him and so you have two it looks like two instances of the mantle falling and after that mantle fell the second time he was able he went back to the River Jordan which types death and he said where is the god of Elijah where is that god of Elijah and any part of the Jordan River parted and he went over on dry ground so that Lamb when Jesus paid the price he paid the price so that that token could be could represent to you it would any evidence to you that death had been conquered that the price had been paid when you get the new birth that token is the evidence to you that the price has been paid but God this last days gives and not another token like a token of brother branham Carla the true baptism of the Holy Spirit something that the church has been waiting on for 2,000 years what is it and not another spirit what it what is adoption it's not something else but it's more of the same it's more revelation and the true baptism of the Holy Spirit is more of the same it's more of that second that same spirit that was given onto the church at the day of Pentecost God said his church in spirit in this last day to restore back to us to faith the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers and put that same that st. the same virtues to say the same way that they walked and talked and put that same power back into the church and then to give a true baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Spirit which is what he called the token and he said in Exodus 12 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses wonder if I should start reading quotes here where you are and when I see the blood when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt the plague shall not be upon you and so the token is a type it's an evidence that death has been defeated because the plague will not be upon you they were down there in there in Egypt when the when the token was applied over the door of their of their of their half of their home and the death Ames and went by on the outside and and they could listen to the howls and the screams and everything and they knew that death could not touch them there now think about this true baptism of the Holy Spirit will be an evidence to you as it comes upon all believers that death cannot teach you that you have a way of escape a way of escape has been prepared for you that revelation 4:1 door a door is open in heaven so you can get out of here they give confidence that you don't have to go through the tribulation because you've already been sanctified you've already been washing that what was revealed under the sixth seal that you've the churches the bride has already been sanctified she don't have to go through the tribulation she has a way out a way of deliverance and you see that's what that's what is revealed under the seals that God has paid the price for you that the blood is a covenant to you that that the token has been applied and by applied I don't mean like in the Old Testament that where they would take a little piece of hyssop and and wipe it over the door but in this day it's applied so that it's visible and by applying it you apply it by faith this is just as they applied it by faith back then but applying it by faith makes it applied to your life it makes it work through you do you see what I'm saying and it becomes the voice of fulfillment where the New Testament the New Testament in my blood is what Jesus said the New Testament is fulfilled in you let me read some quotes we're winding I'm not gonna keep everybody long to this evening so don't get worried Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever number one if y'all could pull that out brothers he's talking about the children of Israel in Egypt and he said the other day I happened to hit something that sounded profound to me and it's very seldom I ever hit anything that I make anything out of but I was thinking just before I reach down to this what I'm going to try to say to you I was thinking of Israel down in Egypt and they were slaves and yet they were children of God we all know the story and yet if they throw them moldy bread they had to eat it if they ravished their daughters if they killed their sons or whatever they did it was just done they were slaves and yet them were the chosen elected of God with a promise waiting until the time of fulfillment and they were waiting for the time of fulfillment for the time of deliverance to come because they knew that God would send them a deliverer they just had to wait for her and so now now we're waiting for the promise we've been waiting for the promise but now that time of fulfillment is at hand and we know that because brother Brown the message of the hour identified and he said it's adoption time it's time it's time to turn the corner all those things now is the time the time of the film fulfillment and see then he goes on to say now that's what's the matter with the Pentecostals today they don't recognize that the time is here the time has come God's promised to be fulfilled let's keep reading on let's go read and sirs we will see Jesus number two he said all the Old Testament teachings pointed to a messiah that was coming and all the Old Testament characters represented this Messiah until it was fulfilled in a man fulfilled in that man Christ Jesus God veiled in flesh I'm not reading again I just want to point that out for anybody listening I that would that wasn't what brother Branham said I'm throwing my own David crying over the Jerusalem after he had been refused rejected King eight hundred years from there the son of David said on the same Mountain rejected King by his own people and wept over Jerusalem Jerusalem to her Jerusalem Josefa borne sung among brothers other brothers that was a peculiar birth and he was born to be a seer he dreamed dreams and seen visions and so forth and he was hated by his brethren to typify the very day we're living in now and there his brethren was great men the patriarchs so you could see all of these things that happened the Old Testament were types and shadows of something that would take place that would actually take place just like how Enoch Enoch took went and walked with God and he is a type of the believer today a type of the believer you are the fulfillment of that time you you are the fulfillment of Enoch not the other way around all these Old Testament prophecies and even the New Testament prophecies things that were spoken of are now being fulfilled in that day and you are the fulfillment of that let's read number five they identified masterpiece of God he said he came to reflect the father and the father was the word hey man now I feel real religious he came to reflect the father's word God said he would be there and there he was the perfect masterpiece of God's great handiwork oh my he was the perfect reflection of him he reflected everything that God had spoke of he reflected what adam said about him he reflected about all the prophets said about all the patriarchs said everything that he said he was the fulfillment of that word all types was fulfilled in him and let's get down to 170 no off the church today could just reflect that first church when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost if the Christian today could reflect we are a hybrid Bunch to what they were because you see if you can reflect what that first church could what that first church did right here then you are candidate for the capstone to come down does everybody understand that was in that first church age and that first church age they had all of these virtues I've got a quote where brother brems said they had all of these virtues but yet one thing that was lacking was this capstone they had all these virtues but they didn't have that that that headship they didn't have that understanding of who the son of man was and all that was encompassed in that which is revealed in the seven seals and that's what the seven seals is is a very special thing for us today well you begin to when you begin to peer into the seven seals and it begins to open up to you it's something that was hidden even from Paul and I rhiness and all the ones that have gone before us but now we have an opportunity to look into that and peer into that that those deep mysteries revelations and yet we leave it on our shelf and getting covered over by dust brother Graham said in the token let's go to number nine he said now the Spirit is the token you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and when the blood was shared the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost like a mighty rushing wind now let's go to number ten let's kind of go quick here in the token again he said there you are the blood the blood the token not the blood chemistry but the token the Holy Ghost the life out of the blood that comes what does that life do what what does that life does comes and confirms what the token has been purchased for the token confirms what the blood bought for you the blood purchased your Redemption the token is an evidence of it the blood he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity chastisement of our peace upon him with His stripes we were healed see all blood blood blood then when the token comes it shows that you've been identified with that sacrifice amen the devil can't keep you from it and how are you identified with that sacrifice is that you went through the same process he went through three pools and you go through three pools you go through that same journey and what I mean by three pools is that he changes your soul he redeemed he's redeemed he paid the pool for a purchase price for redemption on the cross but you have to go through a process where it is made manifest in you and we're full redemption has made manifest to you and that's called full Redemption full Redemption not just not just for your soul but for your spirit and for your body the entire package and that process is the same process that all of the the others you know kind of went through my brother Brown said in the unveiling of God number eleven he said and when you see the word made manifest you see the Father God because the word is the father the word is God and the word made manifest is God Himself taking his own word and manifesting it among believers he takes his word puts his life inside of you quick as that word makes it manifest then you're identified with that and then you can see that token on you you can see it because it's visible it's visible to God and it's visible to your fellow man and so that gives you an assurance that the death that price has been paid that the price for you for your Redemption has been paid in the statute of a perfect man number 12 brother Branham said I can imagine them apostles never acted like us they went around probably a few words till they got in the pulpit they walked in and they doing what they were supposed to do and walked out yes sir they had power they had virtue they had no arguments with men they know where they stood that's all they knowed who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit doing only just as I said the other night one little nod that's all God had to do then nothing going to stop them they didn't question and study and Hum halt and worry like we do whether they should do this or that they went ahead and done it anyhow just one little nod from God that done it just as soon why how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications and the first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with his word they knowed it was the Word of God in a way they went didn't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke they went and because of that they were the living fulfillment of the New Testament their will for the fulfillment of the New Testament in their day and every age had somebody to live and fulfill the word for their day and this day it will be no different it will have someone to accept and receive that word and fulfill it and make it live well I don't know what's going on with my news let's a MUX it got stapled together somehow anyway we'll just keep carrying on and so you can see you can see the prophecy being fulfilled and prophecy was fulfilled just as it was fulfilled in Jesus it's been fulfilled in the bride it's being fulfilled right now because we're living out the scripture the scripture is being made alive in the believer as we receive the word we become the word and so that's how if you want to see manifested sons of God manifested sons of the sons of God become manifested as they receive the word they perceive the word and then then they become the word and they become the manifestation of their our and so now in this last day this work there's a lot of scriptures that need to be fulfilled and one of them was Malachi 4:5 six behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse and so you and I are the fulfillment of that as we receive the message of this day we become we we that we have received the token message and that brings the true baptism of the holy spirit and unlocks the seventh seal book to bring resurrection faith it unlocks the secret to bring redemption of the body because the Bible says in first Corinthians chapter 15 that that the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death so if we're you can see all of these scriptures being fulfilled leading up to this last thing that must be fulfilled that there's got to be somebody like Elijah to receive the word for his day to receive his Elijah and then walk over Jordan just like Elijah did to look at to look at what Jesus did and look at the the journey that he took and mirror that journey and then to be able to pass over death to be able to conquer death that where our bodies can be changed the last enemy to be conquered is death and it will be fulfilled because God will have somebody on earth to fulfill him the larger in in second Kings chapter to 13 to 14 it says he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoke the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elijah went over why because he had gone he had gone past the school of the prophets he had took he had gone on a journey he had gone on his old 3-pole journey you remember brother Branham explaining that from a lot from from Gilgal he started off justification went through the school of the prophets went on to the Jordan River which is death a type of death and then you come forth in a resurrection because he ever believer every believer that comes through this token message has got to go through that same journey of death burial and resurrection that's what that's what King tried to circumvent he tried to he went and took instead of taking doing like like Abel did and taking a bloody sacrifice and bringing that and laying it before the Lord he went and gathered from the field the first fruits which bypasses if you look at all the different feasts the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread he he skipped right over those feasts and went to the feast of firstfruits he went straight to the resurrection without a death in a burrow and you can't have a resurrection without a death and a burial you've got to go through that process and so every believer comes through this same process you that's why if you want to see what you're fulfilling today go back in the Old Testament and follow that pattern and look at that cycle the two cycles of the Old Testament being fulfilled ending with the coming with the Son of Man and the New Testament ending with the coming of the Son of Man we're at the end of this second cycle and it's got to be fulfilled I'm right around in an hour so let's go ahead and I'm gonna close up right now and the musicians you can go ahead and come and we'll close up because see the blood the blood must be applied and it was a token for a and for it was a token for Adam and Eve as they walked out of the garden that the price had been paid it was a token for the children of Israel in Egypt and it'll be a token for you in this day when by receiving the word for your day it becomes alive in you and the word revealed produces the life of Christ the true baptism of the Holy Spirit the true life of Christ in u.s. a token and evidence that you have passed from death in the life you know how brother branham said that there'll be many it's happening right now many are coming to the to the adoption but the whole church has got to come true the whole bride has got to come to an adoption but if someone comes to it to the adoption comes to that place and yet they go down and in the ground like brother Branham did because the whole church as a whole has not come to the pull to that place yet he said in the token messages it said it's an evidence to you that you're gonna come up in the resurrection it's that evidence to you because that the price has been paid it's you can have confidence in there you can you and what gives you confidence as you can see the life of Christ it may manifest in you and that gives you confidence amen you coming up brother I'm running out of things to say all right go ahead yes let's sing that sing that again you testing because there's a New Testament church rising up as I look out across the land God's my head brought a prize adorned in her wedding gown just like in the days of old they stood in Courage Bowl they turn the world upside
