[26:06] we can share god's word the way he's
[26:08] revealed it to us

[26:13] purpose i i know i've been i've been put
[26:15] upon by not men in our church but men
[26:18] and other church hey brother you read
[26:19] too many quotes
[26:23] well you read too much scripture
[26:26] do you understand where i'm coming from
[26:29] see it's been revealed to me that the
[26:30] message of the hour is the bible in a
[26:33] more modern interpretation but then even
[26:36] in that there is revelation hidden in
[26:39] there that ties it back to the bible
[26:42] that's the reason why we can go back and
[26:43] forth between the scripture and the
[26:45] message and not miss it
[26:48] does everybody know what a dovetail is
[26:50] it's not the tail of a bird
[26:53] it's a fitting in cabinetry and woodwork
[26:56] where
[26:57] you put together the two sides of the
[26:58] drawer and i'll tell you what a dovetail
[27:01] usually forms a corner
[27:04] we're turning corner after corner after
[27:05] corner right now
[27:07] god is good to us if you take your
[27:09] bibles ephesians chapter one
[27:13] we'll just continue on
[27:16] i'll get as far as
[27:17] the lord leads and well you just have to
[27:21] be hungry enough to
[27:24] look into the word of god and
[27:26] finish the course
[27:28] that's what paul said he did
[27:30] that's what we're going to do run the
[27:32] race finish the course fight the good
[27:33] fight
[27:34] when you have ephesians 1 say amen
[27:37] we're going to read verses 3 through 9
[27:39] and then 15-23 and yes i will try really
[27:42] hard not to preach on every word
[27:46] blessed be the god and father of our
[27:48] lord jesus christ
[27:51] yeah
[27:52] who hath blessed us
[27:54] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[27:57] places
[27:58] in christ
[28:00] according as he hath chosen us in him
[28:03] before the foundation of the world
[28:06] that we should be holy and without blame
[28:08] before him in love
[28:10] having predestinated us under the
[28:13] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[28:15] himself
[28:17] man we can't lose
[28:19] according to the good pleasure of his
[28:22] will
[28:23] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[28:26] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[28:28] beloved
[28:30] in whom we have redemption through his
[28:32] blood
[28:34] the forgiveness of sins
[28:37] according to the riches of his grace
[28:39] wherein he hath abounded toward us
[28:42] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[28:44] known unto us
[28:47] the mystery of his will
[28:50] according to his good pleasure which he
[28:53] hath purposed
[28:55] in himself
[28:56] now i'm going to hold on and not read
[28:58] verse 10 let's drop down to 15.
[29:02] wherefore i also after i heard of your
[29:05] faith in the lord jesus
[29:08] paul got excited and loved unto all the
[29:11] saints cease not to give thanks for you
[29:15] i want you to notice not to you
[29:18] for you making mention of you in my
[29:20] prayers
[29:22] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[29:25] the father of glory may give unto you
[29:27] the spirit of wisdom
[29:30] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[29:33] the eyes of your understanding being
[29:36] enlightened
[29:37] see you have eyes of understanding but
[29:39] they require enlightenment
[29:42] that ye may know what is the hope
[29:45] of his calling and what the riches of
[29:47] the glory of his inheritance in the
[29:49] saints
[29:50] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[29:52] his power to us for who believe
[29:55] according to the working of his mighty
[29:56] power
[29:58] which he wrought in christ when he
[30:00] raised him from the dead and set him at
[30:02] his own right hand
[30:04] in the heavenly places
[30:07] well i thought he came forth to get the
[30:09] book
[30:10] out of his own right hand
[30:14] far above all principality and power and
[30:16] might and dominion
[30:18] and every name that is named not only in
[30:20] this world which means this age but also
[30:23] in that which is to come and have put
[30:26] all things under his feet
[30:28] and gave him to be the head over all
[30:30] things to the church which is his body
[30:34] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[30:36] all let's pray father
[30:39] lord without you
[30:41] we could do and we would be nothing
[30:45] but with you lord we are all things in
[30:48] christ
[30:50] we're so grateful father for the
[30:52] revelation of it
[30:53] for the sweet words lord that you'll
[30:55] speak to us through father
[30:58] and we realize it's by revelation
[31:00] because you spoke to many father
[31:02] but it just got boiled down to a handful
[31:05] or two lord
[31:07] that actually would stand by
[31:09] without understanding lord but to whom
[31:12] else could they go
[31:14] for you alone
[31:16] and you alone lord have the words of
[31:18] eternal life
[31:19] we pray father that you'd help us let us
[31:21] settle down lord
[31:23] let let the food that we partake in of
[31:25] father
[31:26] let it not overcome us
[31:29] father let us be on the edge of our
[31:30] seats father
[31:32] waiting to hear from you we didn't come
[31:34] here to hear a man lord
[31:36] we didn't come to see one father we came
[31:38] here
[31:39] because you asked us if we would like to
[31:41] come
[31:42] and we responded by being here father
[31:45] and we're willing to receive
[31:48] be it unto us according to thy word
[31:51] in jesus christ's name we pray amen god
[31:54] bless you may be seated now while you've
[31:56] got ephesians in your hand
[31:59] i said i i didn't purposely skip over
[32:02] verse 10 but the reason that i stopped
[32:04] right there
[32:06] is because i would have had to preach on
[32:08] it
[32:09] verse 10
[32:11] ephesians 1 that in the dispensation
[32:15] of the fullness of times now remember
[32:18] something because i've heard different
[32:20] ministers speak on this and i don't
[32:22] disagree with them but
[32:24] part of what i think there is a
[32:26] misunderstanding on is the word
[32:27] dispensation dispensation is a span
[32:32] it's not an instance
[32:34] it's a span of time and activities
[32:39] start
[32:40] take place and then eventually play
[32:43] themselves out in the word dispensation
[32:45] so you see it's it's it's like the age
[32:48] that we live in
[32:49] now we live in the laodicean church h is
[32:52] that right
[32:53] but the prophet of god mentions the
[32:55] bride h
[32:57] he mentions an eternal h
[33:00] he mentions a rapturing h
[33:02] now what we need to understand is that
[33:05] only for the
[33:08] bride she realizes that the laodicean
[33:12] church age is this dispensation or
[33:14] expanse of time
[33:17] and while she has to live in it
[33:21] she's not of it
[33:23] you see that's why there was an open
[33:25] door between the sixth and the seventh
[33:27] age you come up come on up there's a
[33:29] door open now you and i didn't open it
[33:31] it was already opened
[33:33] it was open because god used a man
[33:36] to open that door
[33:39] but now we're in the seventh age
[33:44] the most treacherous
[33:46] the most deceiving
[33:48] the most diabolical
[33:50] [Laughter]
[33:52] but the most complete age
[33:55] because seven is completion in god's
[33:58] mathematical realm
[34:00] that's why i i try to instill in you and
[34:03] the people that i speak to we
[34:05] have
[34:07] a job to do
[34:09] we have something that we can accomplish
[34:12] you may not realize that in your
[34:14] day-to-day walk and thoughts but
[34:15] brothers and sisters
[34:17] god has ordained a group of people
[34:23] and he's defined them this way
[34:26] we which are alive and remain
[34:29] amen
[34:30] shall not hinder
[34:32] those which have gone on before us and
[34:35] i'll tell you why the word hinder is
[34:37] used is because we've come to the
[34:40] realization through the revelation of
[34:42] the word that we can't hinder them
[34:45] because they without us
[34:47] cannot be made perfect so therefore
[34:50] we're told they're waiting on us why
[34:52] would they be waiting on us we're not
[34:54] going to die
[34:58] waiting on us to come to the full mature
[35:02] revelation of the plan of god and that
[35:05] god has children
[35:09] that will fulfill every word
[35:12] we're not talking about the letter of
[35:13] the law
[35:14] because you see the word
[35:17] is the logos
[35:19] it's not the letters on the papers that
[35:22] we're reading
[35:23] it's the
[35:24] manifestation of the supernatural god
[35:29] now that manifestation that logos
[35:33] has to become flesh
[35:35] in order to complete the cycle
[35:38] that's why jesus christ came
[35:41] walked talked breathed
[35:44] ate
[35:45] and and you think he was pain-free
[35:48] oh no
[35:50] oh no he was far from pain-free
[35:53] and look at the kind of body he was
[35:55] walking in
[35:57] he wasn't walking in the kind of body
[35:59] that you and i
[36:01] walk in
[36:02] it wasn't brought into this world the
[36:05] way that you and i were brought through
[36:08] you understand
[36:10] through desire
[36:12] it was brought
[36:14] by the word of god
[36:16] amen
[36:17] yet in that
[36:20] he aged
[36:22] he got tired
[36:24] he had severe headaches we're told
[36:27] migraines unbelievable
[36:30] because that man
[36:34] that we know as jesus
[36:37] was a man
[36:38] [Music]
[36:39] but he had the life the spirit of god
[36:44] living in him
[36:46] still with me
[36:48] all right
[36:49] verse 10
[36:52] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[36:54] of times
[36:57] so now we're going to wind up everything
[36:58] he might gather together in one all
[37:02] things in christ
[37:05] both which are in heaven and which are
[37:08] on earth even in him
[37:11] now i'll tell you what gets me right
[37:13] there the word gather
[37:16] you know me
[37:18] i'm going to read you the definition
[37:20] because brothers and sisters that's how
[37:22] god reveals these things to me and gives
[37:26] them so that i can also
[37:29] give them out amen
[37:31] just bear with me it's here
[37:38] it's awesome
[37:40] so i'm going to look for it till i find
[37:42] it
[37:43] i got it here somewhere
[37:45] just bear with me
[37:48] i'm sure i put it in here
[37:50] because it'll become important to you
[37:52] and me
[37:53] as we begin to find out what these
[37:56] things mean well i had it here somewhere
[37:58] i ain't going to worry about it
[38:00] the word gather
[38:02] in the bible
[38:05] is to bring one or more entities
[38:09] into focus
[38:11] it's too it's it's to have
[38:14] a peripheral
[38:17] number of things
[38:20] that need to be brought in to one place
[38:24] so that they can be counted and
[38:26] recognized
[38:29] so he's gonna
[38:30] gather together
[38:33] in one
[38:34] now remember it's one body
[38:37] many members so now this gathering that
[38:41] paul is talking about in
[38:42] ephesians is going to require the
[38:45] members
[38:47] to be formed and brought
[38:51] corralled if you would
[38:53] into one
[38:55] entity now how do we get into this body
[38:59] how do you become a part of this
[39:00] gathering you're baptized by one spirit
[39:04] into this body there's there's no more
[39:06] conflict now why because it's one spirit
[39:08] it's not two it's not five it's not mine
[39:11] it's not yours
[39:14] it's his
[39:16] it's his spirit
[39:18] that takes you and i
[39:21] from where we were
[39:24] to where we need to be
[39:26] i believe that with all my heart but
[39:27] remember it's his spirit so quit
[39:29] fighting
[39:31] his spirit
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] you're not fighting me
[39:36] this is not a battle against flesh and
[39:37] blood
[39:39] no matter what i say to you or what
[39:41] anybody says to you you're not fighting
[39:43] them it's not a battle of flesh and
[39:45] blood
[39:47] this is a battle against principalities
[39:49] and powers
[39:51] spiritual wickedness in high places
[39:54] what a war and brothers and sisters
[39:57] i'm here to tell you that according to
[40:00] the living god
[40:04] he won
[40:05] and beat the enemy amen
[40:08] he beat the enemy beat him
[40:11] beat him at his own game
[40:13] what is his game death
[40:17] that's all he's got
[40:20] is to try to take you and i to the end
[40:24] as if we had no hope but paul said
[40:27] sorrow not
[40:30] that's those who have no hope
[40:33] because the lord himself
[40:36] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[40:38] with a voice with the trump of god and
[40:40] the dead in christ shall rise first
[40:44] so
[40:45] if we're not gonna hinder and we're
[40:47] gonna be alive and remain then we must
[40:50] have something to do we must be involved
[40:53] in or what we must be defined by
[40:57] amen the lord himself
[41:01] because he's the one doing the
[41:03] descending but it's not the physical
[41:06] corporal body of jesus christ that
[41:08] walked the earth 2 000 years ago
[41:11] yeah
[41:12] it's a voice
[41:14] it's a trump
[41:16] you understand
[41:18] it's an
[41:18] archangel you see it's not the physical
[41:21] corporal body and the reason i want you
[41:23] to see that is because it's still taking
[41:25] place right now
[41:28] i love to say this
[41:30] there are those who are waiting on the
[41:31] coming of the lord but the coming of the
[41:34] lord has been revealed in that he is
[41:38] here
[41:39] so for some he's still coming
[41:42] for you and i he's here but he never
[41:44] stops moving
[41:47] those four living creatures in the book
[41:49] of ezekiel net ezekiel never
[41:53] go backwards
[41:56] yep it's got four faces because no
[41:58] matter which direction they move in
[42:00] the eagle and the ox
[42:02] the lion and the man
[42:05] he's always moving forward
[42:07] and that's what you and i
[42:10] are required to do
[42:12] we can't set still we can't lean back on
[42:16] our laurels we can't say well you know
[42:19] what and i know folks that believe this
[42:21] well i got the holy ghost brother and
[42:23] that's the seal of god and i don't have
[42:24] to do nothing well i read in my bible
[42:27] where once you get the seal of god there
[42:29] is something else to do what is it you
[42:31] must be open
[42:35] something's gotta open you up
[42:39] so that what's contained inside of you
[42:43] can be shared
[42:46] with the dead
[42:48] because the only living hope they got
[42:52] know ye not that ye are written epistles
[42:56] red of all men now you're a walking
[43:00] talking
[43:02] listen now
[43:04] to many people the bible is a biography
[43:08] you know what a biography is
[43:11] it's something written by someone else
[43:15] for someone else
[43:17] but an autobiography is that person
[43:20] themselves
[43:21] writing down about themselves
[43:27] so this is an autobiography to you and
[43:29] me
[43:30] this is not just a biography
[43:33] that's why he said
[43:35] who do men say i the son of man am
[43:37] you don't realize brothers and sisters
[43:39] maybe how simple and how oft-quoted that
[43:41] scripture is
[43:43] but how important it is
[43:45] because once you grasp
[43:47] the true depth of what's going on when
[43:51] jesus said who do men say
[43:53] i the son of man am
[43:58] give me your opinion well some say
[44:00] you're this and some say you're that
[44:01] some say you're elias and some say
[44:03] you're jeremiah or one of the prophets
[44:04] and some say
[44:07] i understand
[44:09] my biography
[44:12] but since i'm the guy
[44:15] she said i want to know who you
[44:17] personally believe that i am who am
[44:23] now what do you think peter do you think
[44:25] peter reached into his pocket
[44:27] got his notebook out
[44:30] hmm
[44:31] well i wrote this down about him and i
[44:32] wrote that down about him and wrote this
[44:34] down about him but
[44:37] through an act
[44:38] a super
[44:40] natural
[44:41] act see that's that's where we lack a
[44:43] lot of times
[44:44] do you realize that when you get a
[44:47] revelation a true revelation of anything
[44:50] in god's word
[44:51] it wasn't the preacher it wasn't the
[44:53] prophet
[44:55] it wasn't the recording it wasn't the
[44:57] reading of it it wasn't even you
[45:01] my father which is in heaven has
[45:03] revealed this to you man
[45:06] you should be feeling good you want to
[45:08] run the aisles
[45:10] if you're getting revelation cause it
[45:12] ain't you
[45:14] a lot of the running the aisles and
[45:16] jumping across the pews is them
[45:18] but i'm talking about when the word of
[45:20] god is eternally internally revealed to
[45:23] you you're like
[45:26] there is a man who could turn on the
[45:28] light
[45:30] amen he's got to be living in my heart
[45:32] because i don't even know where the
[45:33] switch is
[45:36] that's fine but he does
[45:39] he's the master
[45:42] and he makes it happen
[45:46] brother it's not happening to me
[45:47] surrender
[45:49] amen
[45:50] put them hands up in the air and say
[45:51] lord
[45:53] man
[45:55] i haven't gotten nothing this far lord
[45:57] but i'll tell you what i'm gonna keep
[45:58] surrendering
[46:01] you leave that skeleton key on the end
[46:04] of that kite long enough
[46:07] get her up there
[46:09] get her up there
[46:12] he knew that once lightning struck that
[46:15] key
[46:16] on the end of that kite
[46:18] yep a light was gonna come on
[46:22] you just keep them up there
[46:27] keep them hands out there they get weak
[46:30] give them a rest
[46:31] the next time a storm comes they'll run
[46:33] outside
[46:36] get that key up there get that kite in
[46:38] here
[46:39] say lord
[46:41] you can't
[46:42] you have to keep your word
[46:44] and i'm surrendering to you lord with
[46:47] everything that's in me and and of
[46:49] course the little guy you know on the
[46:50] shoulder there the with the pitchfork
[46:52] and the little horns he said yeah right
[46:55] but don't listen to him listen to the
[46:57] other guy over there that says come on
[46:59] come on you can do it come on you can do
[47:01] it
[47:02] i know you can do it keep them hands up
[47:04] in the air it'll happen because he's the
[47:06] god of his word
[47:08] but he's testing you
[47:10] oh test i've been tested so many times
[47:13] i'm about wore out yeah but he wants to
[47:15] see how long yeah
[47:19] you'll wait
[47:20] you know why because we live in an
[47:22] impatient time yeah come on i'm one of
[47:25] you you're like me somebody gets in the
[47:27] way on the road we're in a hurry come on
[47:30] we pull up to the fast food restaurant
[47:32] chick-fil-a is terrible man you back way
[47:34] way back
[47:37] two lines
[47:39] wait wait so get there early
[47:42] you know before you get hungry
[47:44] by the time you get your food
[47:46] you'd be feeling good you understand
[47:48] it's the day we live in everything is
[47:50] impatient we're we're frustrated when
[47:52] the internet speed slows down to one
[47:54] point zillion
[47:56] come on man come on
[48:00] when god says well i got the remedy for
[48:02] that
[48:04] keep your hands up in the air
[48:08] he's so good to us i'm gonna tell you
[48:09] that right now
[48:11] that's right
[48:12] i wanted to read to you out of ephesians
[48:14] also
[48:17] chapter six
[48:24] verse 10
[48:27] through 17 you want to see something in
[48:29] the air
[48:31] just hang
[48:32] on when you have it say amen i know the
[48:35] brothers put it up there but i sure like
[48:37] the
[48:38] sound
[48:40] of the pages turning and you know
[48:43] i mentioned that to her brother and he
[48:44] came up with some app
[48:48] that made the sound of pages turning
[48:55] they got one
[48:58] i said i think god wants you to do it
[49:02] finally
[49:04] [Laughter]
[49:06] finally
[49:08] my brethren
[49:11] be strong in the lord and then the power
[49:13] of his might
[49:14] put on the whole armor of god that he
[49:17] may be able to stand
[49:19] i mean i if you read this the way i do
[49:22] there's no guarantee here
[49:24] that he may be able
[49:26] to stand
[49:28] against the wiles of the devil
[49:33] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[49:35] blood
[49:36] but against principalities against
[49:38] powers against the rulers of the
[49:39] darkness of this world against spiritual
[49:42] witness in high places and don't we know
[49:44] it
[49:46] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[49:49] of god
[49:50] that ye may be able
[49:55] to withstand
[49:56] in the evil day
[49:59] and having done all to stand
[50:02] stand
[50:04] stand therefore
[50:06] having your loins gird about with truth
[50:09] and having on the breastplate of
[50:10] righteousness i want you to notice the
[50:12] armor we're using doesn't look like very
[50:14] good protection
[50:17] depends on what you're fighting
[50:19] this is not a physical battle it's not a
[50:21] flesh and blood battle
[50:28] and your feet
[50:30] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[50:32] of peace
[50:35] above all taking the shield of faith
[50:37] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[50:38] all well that's a guarantee
[50:42] the fiery darts
[50:44] of the wicked
[50:45] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[50:48] sword of the spirit
[50:50] which is
[50:52] the word
[50:54] of god
[50:55] is that right
[50:57] all right i'm going to finish the
[50:59] definition of the word symbol
[51:01] and we're going to go to revelations 5.
[51:06] i read to you the beginning part of it
[51:09] out of the dictionary
[51:10] literally a token of identity verified
[51:13] by comparing its other half something
[51:14] that stands for or suggests something
[51:16] else
[51:17] listen to this one
[51:19] by reason of relationship association
[51:22] convention or accidental resemblance
[51:28] that's right
[51:29] listen now
[51:31] especially
[51:32] a visible sign of something invisible
[51:38] you see where we come in
[51:41] with this body brothers and sisters you
[51:43] may not know it because you bypassed
[51:45] your theophany but this body is a symbol
[51:49] visible symbol of something invisible
[51:55] we represent something else
[51:58] amen
[51:59] the kingdom
[52:01] and that kingdom has a king
[52:04] and that king is jesus
[52:09] watch this
[52:11] last definition
[52:14] an object
[52:17] how many knows what the definition of
[52:18] the word god is
[52:20] an object of worship
[52:23] a symbol is an object
[52:26] or act representing something in the
[52:29] unconscious mind
[52:32] i didn't write this
[52:34] i just got the dictionary out that's
[52:36] been repressed
[52:39] and do you realize brothers and sisters
[52:41] that what's happening to us
[52:44] through the word of god and the hour we
[52:45] live in that there's something back
[52:47] there
[52:49] in the back part
[52:52] well yeah but now it's your mind
[52:55] you see because we all make up
[52:58] a portion of the body of christ
[53:01] and the day that you and i live in
[53:05] is the portion of the body of christ the
[53:07] feed age paul
[53:10] bodies building up higher and higher and
[53:13] higher and of course god sent a prophet
[53:14] so what is a prophet
[53:17] mouth peace oh but that's not all he is
[53:21] he's the ice
[53:23] that's why he's represented by an eagle
[53:24] because he can get way way way up there
[53:27] and look way way down and off across the
[53:30] horizon and say thus saith the lord
[53:34] because i see a vision
[53:36] that's some good eyes
[53:39] now if it don't come to pass don't
[53:42] believe him
[53:44] but if it comes to pass the bible says
[53:46] you listen
[53:48] to those eyes
[53:50] through that mouth
[53:52] that i put
[53:54] in that face of that prophet you with me
[53:58] but guess what
[54:00] it ain't over
[54:03] what's this can these bones live
[54:07] wow hallelujah oh yeah
[54:10] my wife says honey if you don't eat more
[54:12] you're gonna dry up and blow away can
[54:15] these bones live
[54:20] yes
[54:22] there's something on the inside of the
[54:24] believer
[54:26] it doesn't fear death
[54:29] i'll tell you how strong that belief is
[54:33] when jesus said
[54:35] i have the power
[54:37] to lay my life down
[54:38] and pick it up now you know you and i
[54:41] don't have that power that way but if
[54:45] we're in him
[54:47] the power's in us
[54:48] [Applause]
[54:50] it's laying there we don't have to fear
[54:53] death
[54:54] if the spirit of him that raised up
[54:57] jesus from the dead
[54:59] dwell in you
[55:01] is that right
[55:03] that's a reality brothers and sisters
[55:05] that's not just a statement it's not
[55:07] words in a book to me
[55:10] oh death paul said where is thy stand
[55:12] see paul had that revelation
[55:14] come on
[55:16] it's just brother branham said uh
[55:18] harnessed something harnessed to take us
[55:22] to a better place
[55:24] my brothers and sisters
[55:26] i believe
[55:28] the scripture tells us
[55:30] again that there will be a group of
[55:33] people
[55:35] now can i ask you a question why not you
[55:39] why not me
[55:41] whoa well what if you die tomorrow
[55:42] praise the lord
[55:46] i just got on the bus early
[55:50] but
[55:52] god has an elect select special
[55:56] i like to call them special forces but
[55:58] it's not that kind of battle
[56:01] that he has ordained
[56:03] because he knows they're a part of him
[56:06] so much so
[56:08] that they won't back down
[56:11] oh
[56:12] i'm not talking about picking a fight
[56:13] with your neighbor
[56:16] i'm talking about they won't back down
[56:18] from god's word and its truth
[56:21] and they will slay the enemy
[56:24] at any and every opportunity bite but
[56:27] it's also
[56:28] written
[56:30] listen here devil
[56:32] you come at me with your sticks and your
[56:34] stones
[56:36] but the word of god is sharper more
[56:38] powerful
[56:40] you want to talk about
[56:42] a weapon
[56:43] with this armor
[56:45] but my emphasis in this entire scripture
[56:47] is stand
[56:49] it's like putting your hands up in the
[56:51] air
[56:52] keep them there right
[56:54] until
[56:56] the light comes on and let me tell you
[56:58] something about these sands
[57:00] once the light comes on
[57:03] you don't want to put them down
[57:05] it's not a one-night stand
[57:08] it's not just one bolt of lightning
[57:12] it's the power of god
[57:15] once it strikes
[57:18] the filament of your soul
[57:20] we don't have to be like thomas edison
[57:22] and experiment
[57:24] he's already done it for us
[57:27] it's been proven
[57:28] amen
[57:29] this is ours brothers and sisters
[57:31] because god gave it to us
[57:33] we don't have what it takes
[57:36] without him
[57:40] to possess it
[57:43] but with him
[57:46] he's the creator
[57:49] of the universe
[57:51] of anything and everything
[57:53] now listen
[57:55] you have to believe that amen
[57:58] emphatically
[57:59] absolutely
[58:01] because without that core belief
[58:04] the devil
[58:07] will persuade you
[58:09] any way he can
[58:12] he doesn't care what he has to use
[58:15] he doesn't love you he hates you
[58:17] he doesn't want to see you happy he
[58:19] wants to see you sad and upset
[58:22] downtrodden disappointed unfulfilled
[58:27] that's his job
[58:29] is that how you want to feel
[58:31] i don't really think anybody wants but
[58:33] people get so despondent
[58:36] they see no reason to live
[58:39] that's because they misunderstand life
[58:42] let me tell you what eternal life is and
[58:44] i didn't make up the definition i'm just
[58:46] repeating what the what god's dictionary
[58:48] says eternal life is
[58:50] living for others
[58:52] you start living for others
[58:55] and something will begin to take place
[58:58] inside of you
[58:59] that the devil
[59:01] can't
[59:02] touch now unfortunately because we're
[59:05] creatures of time living for others is
[59:08] also dying for others oh not for their
[59:10] sins
[59:13] but you're expending the valuable life
[59:16] that you have while you're here
[59:20] for a purpose that you don't think is
[59:22] gaining you much ground
[59:25] but when it comes to the judgment amen
[59:29] it won't be a lion
[59:34] that's what we're looking for
[59:36] revelations 5.
[59:38] yes
[59:39] we read it but i want to put emphasis on
[59:41] something if it's okay with you
[59:44] i know that we read this morning uh
[59:46] verses one through
[59:49] four or five
[59:51] i'm going to start at verse five if you
[59:53] got it say amen or
[59:54] when the brothers give it up on the
[59:57] okay
[59:59] you ready
[1:00:01] listen now and one of the elders saith
[1:00:04] unto me weep not behold the lion of the
[1:00:06] tribe of judah the root of david hath
[1:00:08] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:00:10] the seven seals thereof
[1:00:13] i'm going to stop right there and i
[1:00:14] mentioned this to you who study the
[1:00:16] message
[1:00:17] it's the very reason this portion of
[1:00:20] scripture is the very reason why brother
[1:00:23] branham was concerned if i used the word
[1:00:25] distraught it wouldn't be the correct
[1:00:27] exact definition but he was concerned
[1:00:32] when he was speaking on what time is it
[1:00:34] serves or is this the time of the
[1:00:35] answers or services is the time you know
[1:00:37] the message i'm talking about
[1:00:39] he was concerned
[1:00:41] read it listen to it he had family
[1:00:43] members that weren't saved he had any
[1:00:44] any thought that could this be it could
[1:00:46] could this be is this the sign of the
[1:00:48] end
[1:00:51] because he realized that it would be
[1:00:53] judgment yeah
[1:00:56] everything would come to a halt
[1:00:59] and things and people as we know them
[1:01:01] would be judged based on the moment
[1:01:04] they came to a halt
[1:01:06] just like this elder saying behold the
[1:01:09] lion of the tribe of judah prevailed oh
[1:01:11] no it's judgment
[1:01:12] because the lion
[1:01:15] is dutch
[1:01:17] guess what he is he's the king
[1:01:20] not of the earth
[1:01:22] the beasts
[1:01:25] see how judgment comes he's the king
[1:01:29] of beasts
[1:01:31] and there's an image to the beast and
[1:01:33] there's the beast
[1:01:35] and these bodies of flesh without a soul
[1:01:40] our beasts
[1:01:43] the animal kingdom
[1:01:47] and while king david under inspiration
[1:01:48] killed a lion
[1:01:50] you try it
[1:01:54] brother branham himself even said
[1:01:58] he didn't go lion hunting in africa with
[1:02:00] a slingshot
[1:02:03] he had special loads made right so he
[1:02:06] could be sure and take that thing down
[1:02:08] you understand where we're at brothers
[1:02:10] and sisters we're right on the threshold
[1:02:12] of judgment and the only difference
[1:02:14] between
[1:02:15] judgment
[1:02:16] for humanity for you and i
[1:02:21] and salvation
[1:02:25] is what you see
[1:02:28] because john turned
[1:02:30] to see a lion
[1:02:33] thinking this is it
[1:02:36] behold the great judgment is going to
[1:02:38] come up before us
[1:02:40] but john being a type and a
[1:02:42] representative of the church
[1:02:46] turned what's the bible say
[1:02:50] and i beheld
[1:02:53] and lo in the midst of the throne and of
[1:02:55] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:02:58] elders stood
[1:03:01] a lamb
[1:03:03] i'm putting emphasis right now as i
[1:03:05] finish this portion of this message
[1:03:07] tonight on the lamb
[1:03:11] standing
[1:03:13] remember its location location
[1:03:17] location
[1:03:19] so brother branham again as i've already
[1:03:23] repeated to you is john hadn't seen the
[1:03:27] lamb up to this time he was expecting to
[1:03:29] see judgment he was expecting to see the
[1:03:31] king of beasts he was expecting to see
[1:03:33] lion
[1:03:36] and he turned
[1:03:38] and he hadn't seen the lamb before
[1:03:40] brother brahm said
[1:03:41] as
[1:03:42] again i i know i hope you get this he
[1:03:44] was way back in the eternities
[1:03:48] where was he
[1:03:52] well it's defined
[1:03:55] in the word midst
[1:04:01] midst
[1:04:03] the dictionary says location
[1:04:10] the middle
[1:04:12] oh but here's where it found its root
[1:04:16] listen carefully
[1:04:18] a position
[1:04:21] what does the prophet of god constantly
[1:04:24] say
[1:04:24] the bride
[1:04:26] is lacking
[1:04:28] the revelation of her position
[1:04:32] once she gets in her position he says
[1:04:34] then she'll be ready for the rapture
[1:04:37] right
[1:04:39] i'm just i know i'm just paraphrasing to
[1:04:41] you what the prophet has said
[1:04:43] a position of proximity so
[1:04:47] if he if they say he's in the desert go
[1:04:48] not forth
[1:04:50] if they say he's here go no you don't
[1:04:51] have to do that because he should be
[1:04:54] within you
[1:04:55] that puts you in the proximity
[1:04:58] so this is a position of proximity to
[1:05:01] the members
[1:05:05] of a
[1:05:06] group it's the very reason why brother
[1:05:10] branham
[1:05:11] was inspired and compelled by god to use
[1:05:15] the word
[1:05:16] eternities
[1:05:18] you get that
[1:05:20] it's plural
[1:05:21] how can there be more than one
[1:05:26] it's like i say how can there be two
[1:05:28] more more than one omnipotence when two
[1:05:30] omnipotent that doesn't even make sense
[1:05:34] what are they going to wrestle to a tie
[1:05:38] think about it is it a draw
[1:05:42] when they get together to box
[1:05:46] a-l-l all powerful is what omnipotence
[1:05:50] oh
[1:05:52] there's nothing there's nothing greater
[1:05:54] than
[1:05:55] everything is less than
[1:05:57] but how can two of those meet
[1:06:00] the same way this lamb is hidden back in
[1:06:03] the eternities
[1:06:05] because he's in the midst
[1:06:10] of members
[1:06:12] oh i want you to get this if nothing
[1:06:14] else he's in the midst john hadn't seen
[1:06:17] him because he was inside
[1:06:22] [Applause]
[1:06:24] his members
[1:06:27] they don't see jesus when they see you
[1:06:30] they mock you
[1:06:32] they want to crucify you
[1:06:36] they want to impugn you
[1:06:41] you don't look like jesus to me
[1:06:43] here turn these stones to bread
[1:06:46] come on it's the mentality of people
[1:06:49] well you don't look much like jesus to
[1:06:51] me
[1:06:52] no that's because
[1:06:55] you don't see him
[1:07:00] he's in the midst
[1:07:03] of the eternities
[1:07:05] did you realize brothers and sisters
[1:07:07] that when you have god living in you you
[1:07:10] have eternal life
[1:07:12] what does that make you
[1:07:14] an eternity
[1:07:18] this lamb
[1:07:19] was hidden
[1:07:22] to the view
[1:07:25] of all who did not know
[1:07:28] where he was at
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:31] but god permitted john because the book
[1:07:34] of revelation is a book of symbols and
[1:07:37] he wanted to make sure that you and i
[1:07:40] january the 2nd 2022
[1:07:44] had a reference
[1:07:48] that we could depend on
[1:07:52] something that we could look into and go
[1:07:55] i've said it so many times but i i see
[1:07:57] it more and more myself you know the
[1:07:59] little boy he'd never seen himself
[1:08:01] before they went to visit the wealthy
[1:08:03] aunt
[1:08:05] she had a mirror
[1:08:07] in the hallway and he's playing down in
[1:08:08] the bedrooms and he comes out and the
[1:08:10] hallway door happened to close
[1:08:15] what's that
[1:08:18] he'd never seen one thing or not you and
[1:08:19] i that mirrors doesn't but if you'd
[1:08:21] never seen
[1:08:24] you would think
[1:08:28] what is that
[1:08:30] then he figures it out
[1:08:32] he starts walking towards it and he
[1:08:33] notices that it's walking towards him
[1:08:35] and he gets that he moves his head to
[1:08:36] the left and he moves in and he moves
[1:08:38] his hands and
[1:08:40] hey
[1:08:42] hey that's that's a strange object
[1:08:46] yeah that's right that's you
[1:08:50] i i never i never seen that before
[1:08:53] well brothers and sisters do you realize
[1:08:55] by the revelation of jesus christ as you
[1:08:57] begin to look into the mirror of god's
[1:08:59] word
[1:09:00] eventually
[1:09:03] when you bob your head to the left
[1:09:07] it bobs its head to the left
[1:09:10] and when you go to the right and when
[1:09:11] you move your arms
[1:09:12] and when you begin to stand
[1:09:15] see having done all to stand
[1:09:18] stan do you realize brothers and sisters
[1:09:22] i can read it to you where brother
[1:09:24] branham tells us that once the lamb
[1:09:27] reaches that book and gets it in his
[1:09:29] hand
[1:09:30] it's over
[1:09:33] soul's in prison now he says it towards
[1:09:34] the end of the day it's over
[1:09:36] yeah
[1:09:38] so then
[1:09:39] you would think that we would want to
[1:09:41] keep him from getting that book in his
[1:09:44] hands
[1:09:45] so we could buy some time
[1:09:48] but what we are failing to recognize is
[1:09:51] that the reaching for
[1:09:53] and the reception of what we found out
[1:09:56] now is not an actual book
[1:09:59] but a manifest
[1:10:02] a list of names
[1:10:04] they have a much greater meaning
[1:10:07] and that
[1:10:09] motion
[1:10:10] of that lamb's standing
[1:10:14] is the resurrection
[1:10:16] of life
[1:10:19] and you and i were dead in sin and
[1:10:22] trespasses
[1:10:25] but now we live
[1:10:27] but not i paul said but christ that
[1:10:30] liveth in me
[1:10:32] so brothers and sisters when that last
[1:10:34] one comes in brother branham tells us
[1:10:38] the book is closed
[1:10:41] the book is not available what's in that
[1:10:44] book is no longer pertinent it does not
[1:10:46] pertain why because what's in that book
[1:10:49] is you and i
[1:10:51] and when the last one gets in position
[1:10:55] meaning the revelation
[1:10:57] of that book remember it's not an actual
[1:11:00] book
[1:11:02] it's a symbol but the revelation of
[1:11:05] what's going on in revelation think
[1:11:06] about it
[1:11:08] you say how
[1:11:09] have you ever read revelations 4
[1:11:13] so where's the first throne
[1:11:16] heaven
[1:11:18] if you've never studied it before it's
[1:11:20] in revelation chapter 4 and 5
[1:11:23] second throne
[1:11:25] in christ
[1:11:27] third throne in the heart of man is that
[1:11:29] right
[1:11:31] do you have a scofield bible you don't
[1:11:32] have to have one i'm just asking
[1:11:35] revelations 4
[1:11:36] it says
[1:11:39] things which shall be hereafter
[1:11:41] the seven seals and then introduction to
[1:11:44] the throne in heaven
[1:11:48] but the third throne is in the heart of
[1:11:49] man
[1:11:50] you start reading now remember this is a
[1:11:53] book of symbols
[1:11:55] you start reading in revelations 4 and
[1:11:56] you go wow that's tremendous yeah did
[1:11:59] you realize where that's taking place
[1:12:02] in your heart
[1:12:04] but it's because it's in symbol form it
[1:12:05] looks like well that's a crazy
[1:12:07] wild
[1:12:09] thing
[1:12:11] but god
[1:12:13] knows what he can do with you
[1:12:18] and you may not realize it but when he
[1:12:20] comes in
[1:12:22] and you are caught up
[1:12:25] because of him in heavenly places in
[1:12:28] christ jesus you get to see things
[1:12:32] hereafter
[1:12:34] not everybody gets to see them
[1:12:38] only the bride of christ
[1:12:41] is in this catching away
[1:12:44] now a lot of people will say well wait a
[1:12:46] minute now brother branham said from
[1:12:47] revelations chapters one through three
[1:12:50] is the church ages yes he did i believe
[1:12:52] that amen
[1:12:54] but that's not all he said
[1:12:58] watch what else he said
[1:13:02] in the book of daniel
[1:13:06] now in the third chapter the church was
[1:13:08] gone up
[1:13:10] but now redemption is to be revealed
[1:13:14] watch the word brother branham uses how
[1:13:17] the church was redeemed
[1:13:21] the revelation of what taken place
[1:13:23] during the church age see the church is
[1:13:26] gone so he is now showing in the fifth
[1:13:29] chapter
[1:13:39] it is to those who are involved in how
[1:13:43] he did it it doesn't pertain to
[1:13:47] everybody else
[1:13:49] it pertains to a group a select members
[1:13:53] number of people
[1:13:57] who have looked in the mirror
[1:13:59] of his word and says
[1:14:03] mama that's me
[1:14:05] that's me
[1:14:07] i see that
[1:14:09] that's me mama
[1:14:13] what taken place how he sealed the
[1:14:16] church off i'm still reading the
[1:14:18] revelation of his name
[1:14:21] water baptism
[1:14:23] using his name
[1:14:26] eternal life no eternal hell serpent
[1:14:30] seed eternal security all the great
[1:14:33] doctrines predestination of the church
[1:14:36] that was revealed to the church he's
[1:14:39] showing how he done it
[1:14:43] so that's the reason why it's important
[1:14:45] for you and i to go beyond the church
[1:14:48] ages
[1:14:51] but we don't throw them out
[1:14:56] they're the conduit
[1:14:59] they're the vehicle
[1:15:01] the way
[1:15:03] that the life
[1:15:04] is moving
[1:15:06] through the church
[1:15:10] but the life
[1:15:12] has a destination
[1:15:15] what is that destination
[1:15:18] the kernel
[1:15:19] the seed
[1:15:21] its original
[1:15:23] form
[1:15:25] you know that pillar of fire we have a
[1:15:26] picture of of
[1:15:28] did you know that was jesus
[1:15:32] it's the same pillar of fire paul saw
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:36] i'm jesus he said whom thou persecutest
[1:15:38] all right it was a pillar of fire amen
[1:15:41] he said i came from god
[1:15:43] i go back to god
[1:15:45] brothers and sisters you may not realize
[1:15:47] it in closing but
[1:15:49] that's what's being revealed to you and
[1:15:50] me
[1:15:52] you see we couldn't make the statement
[1:15:54] emphatically because we bypassed
[1:15:56] something
[1:15:58] but god permitted us to bypass it
[1:16:02] so that he could express
[1:16:06] the attributes that were bottled and
[1:16:08] closed up in him but wanted to get out
[1:16:12] now that those attributes have been
[1:16:14] expressed guess what
[1:16:17] we want to go home
[1:16:20] we want to go home
[1:16:22] if you've been saved you know it that's
[1:16:24] how if you're saved and you know it
[1:16:28] say amen
[1:16:29] amen if you're saved and you know it say
[1:16:32] amen well if you're saved and you know
[1:16:36] it
[1:16:36] then your life will surely show it
[1:16:39] so then if you're saved and you know it

[1:16:45] please stand
[1:16:47] we go on for hours i'm gonna stop right
[1:16:48] there

[1:25:32] in a speaking condition right sure faith
[1:25:34] comes by hearing we've hear we've heard
[1:25:36] for years and years and years now it's
[1:25:38] time for us to like i said before
[1:25:40] let what's inside of us out right now
[1:25:43] quit binding it let it out i don't care
[1:25:45] if it's the devil you want him out
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:49] like i said before i don't i want
[1:25:50] everybody to feel comfortable except the
[1:25:52] devil i do not want him to feel
[1:25:53] comfortable in this building
[1:25:55] i want him to feel like he needs to
[1:25:56] leave because when you feel
[1:25:57] uncomfortable what do you do you leave
[1:26:00] amen that's why joanna and chris are
[1:26:02] leaving tomorrow
[1:26:06] brother george smith said though three
[1:26:08] days you know
[1:26:09] visitors are like fish after three days
[1:26:13] let's kick them out
[1:26:15] but we eat fish last night i'm sorry

[1:26:18] so anyway but we love them and we enjoy
[1:26:20] them i know you do you feel real
[1:26:23] comfortable chris feels real comfortable
[1:26:25] bringing the message to you
[1:26:27] and and that's the testimony of brother
[1:26:29] dale how he tells us how to treat people
[1:26:31] treat people like brothers and sisters
[1:26:33] amen not some second rate first rate
[1:26:35] even though we might be second team okay
[1:26:38] second choice
[1:26:40] you know there was one time that henry
[1:26:41] aaron when he i believe the first time
[1:26:43] he went to bat he struck out
[1:26:45] 1959 with the milwaukee braves i think
[1:26:48] the first up baddie struck out he didn't
[1:26:50] quit though
[1:26:51] he went on to hit 714 home runs and be
[1:26:54] one of the best ball players that ever
[1:26:55] lived so we all start somewhere right
[1:26:58] yeah man we all start somewhere so we're
[1:27:00] starting this new year
[1:27:02] uh brother bob will be speaking for us
[1:27:03] wednesday night and then uh we should be
[1:27:05] having regular service

[1:27:11] a heart cath next tuesday not this
[1:27:13] coming but this coming tuesday they're
[1:27:15] gonna do all my blood work and all that
[1:27:16] stuff so just pray that everything's
[1:27:18] good and okay
[1:27:20] um we've got
[1:27:23] we've got a power
[1:27:25] that we're not tapping into
[1:27:28] we're not tapping into it but but we can
[1:27:30] like brother chris just said he said
[1:27:32] it's already here
[1:27:33] we don't have to have it coming the
[1:27:35] whole world's looking for something to
[1:27:36] come
[1:27:38] and that's the devil he keeps pushing it
[1:27:39] looking for something to come
[1:27:41] oh the bible says oh we've heard that
[1:27:44] since the beginning of time you know the
[1:27:46] lord's coming we've heard that since the
[1:27:48] beginning oh he's going to do this since
[1:27:50] the beginning of time they told brother
[1:27:51] brown they said days and miracles are
[1:27:53] passed
[1:27:54] too late too late too late
[1:27:57] no news is done out word's done out we
[1:27:59] already been filled with the holy ghost
[1:28:00] so
[1:28:01] blue devil come on
[1:28:10] but i gotta have uh
[1:28:15] yes mom's got to see what she's allergic
[1:28:17] to so um they'll be pricking her all
[1:28:19] over her body and she'll be looking like
[1:28:21] she's got the month
[1:28:23] i hope not that way she that because
[1:28:25] means that she's allergic to everything
[1:28:26] so
[1:28:27] hey man so let's just remember that and
[1:28:29] also
[1:28:30] remember brother jt pageant

[1:28:35] he did have a stroke mini stroke
[1:28:42] yes the blood pressure and he still has
[1:28:44] a little droop in his
[1:28:46] in his face but you know what
[1:28:48] that's nothing to god all these words
[1:28:50] that we put out cancer coveted god's
[1:28:52] just like going what are you talking
[1:28:54] about
[1:28:55] nothing to me so let's just put it in
[1:28:57] god's hands brother pageant's got a
[1:28:59] group of people that he that he needs to
[1:29:00] lead so we need to pray that those
