[0:17] remember the people in there some people
[0:24] have them I want it now once one Louise
[0:37] from my house I woke up he was alright
[0:49] let's get started
[0:51] now we're talking on the book Romans
[0:53] we're on Romans nine we've got it
[0:54] finally I finished the Romans eight last
[0:56] then me well time for last then starting
[0:59] on home is 9 Roman same is a beautiful
[1:02] chapter you know as well as I do it
[1:04] brings adoption in and grant and you
[1:06] birth it brings going on to perfection
[1:08] that brings in those who these justified
[1:12] is already glorified so what can we say
[1:15] to this Paul some eyes the whole chapter
[1:17] says if God be for us who can be against
[1:20] us so we must we must see that even in
[1:23] peril and life and death and all the
[1:25] things that go on that if God be for us
[1:28] who can be against us amen
[1:32] remember everything here is temporal
[1:35] temporary even your life that you're
[1:39] breathing right now is temporary right
[1:40] amen but we're not gonna breathe the
[1:43] same manner when we come back in the
[1:45] millennium know it would be a lot
[1:47] cleaner below
[1:48] their well-being disease going in and
[1:50] out of our body through our breath we'll
[1:53] have to ever worry about that again
[1:55] amen amen no what no that's your heart
[2:02] well that's all right but we got to we
[2:05] got we got to get there first
[2:06] that's right and this is our part now is
[2:08] to get in there part we got to get there
[2:10] first the man so we got to get the Bible
[2:13] down we got to get in all the scriptures
[2:15] down and I was thinking yesterday and
[2:21] actually this morning when I was writing
[2:22] my little note brother now about how
[2:26] that brother Graham said there was an
[2:27] eternal quality to the elect and that's
[2:31] what I was thinking brother Dale for
[2:32] doing was to bring he's bringing that
[2:34] eternal quality to us but he had to get
[2:37] clerks
[2:38] yeah there's always one had to get it
[2:39] first so he got the eternal quality
[2:41] first and he then he is he is giving
[2:45] that eternal quality to me and you and
[2:46] man eternal quality I love those two
[2:48] words eternal quality so in other words
[2:51] that quality is never going to go away
[2:53] that quality is always eternal and what
[2:56] is it is the Word of God it's the Word
[2:58] of God not even written form it's the
[2:59] Word of God reveal and that's what we're
[3:02] trying to see here there's the Word of
[3:03] God revealed not just the Word of God in
[3:05] a letter form because the lair kill will
[3:08] kill you all this will kill you if you
[3:10] don't become it and that's our whole
[3:12] that's our whole point even in the seals
[3:15] I believe brother Adam came to a point
[3:16] degree solve it then what he was
[3:19] bringing was the truth and that man had
[3:22] come to a place to we're all back in
[3:24] time is like I was saying Sunday they
[3:28] actually they put the Sun man out of the
[3:30] church they put Christ out of church
[3:31] because he was then you know at the door
[3:35] knocking there in Revelations and it was
[3:36] sealed and probably from me and Bob sent
[3:38] me a text I think maybe he understood
[3:41] what was going on but that that door was
[3:43] sealed with seven seals when they kicked
[3:46] him out of the church it was sealed with
[3:50] salmon sails and he couldn't get back in
[3:52] until he knocked on the door and thanks
[3:56] a prophet that opened the door first to
[3:58] let us in and then we could all go we
[4:01] can all bring Christ in there let him
[4:03] sup with us because I don't believe he's
[4:05] stuck with man since Adam the way he
[4:09] wants to he's not stuck with man the way
[4:13] he wants to
[4:14] except when Adam and Eve were in the
[4:15] garden there was no sin he said well
[4:17] he's he can stuck with the eleven well
[4:19] he stuck with Dwight I'm one of the
[4:21] devil but they didn't understand who he
[4:23] was until they came he came back on the
[4:24] day of Pentecost in the form of the Holy
[4:26] Ghost into the believer so dark - Christ
[4:36] - so gloomy go but that way Mackey not
[4:38] know that wasn't that one creatures
[4:40] revelation yeah that's what we've done
[4:42] by Sunday okay well we're talking about
[4:46] a little bit more that's coming Sunday
[4:47] because what Peter said Jesus said flesh
[4:50] and blood didn't reveal that to you but
[4:53] my father in heaven that was the
[4:55] revelation of the father Peter never got
[4:58] that revelation he was speaking in a
[5:01] prophecy through it that God was
[5:03] speaking through Peter there aren't
[5:05] across the son living God because listen
[5:08] Peter never answered his question right
[5:12] Peter never answers the question but God
[5:16] being gracious God being patient
[5:19] Laurita this afternoon I'm going a
[5:22] little bit more
[5:23] Jesus asked said who do men say I the
[5:25] Son of Man am the son of man is
[5:27] something God's different he said Who I
[5:30] am I the Son of Man
[5:34] Peter said thou art the Christ the Son
[5:36] of the Living God in other words you're
[5:38] the creator god but we don't in other
[5:40] words we don't understand why that flash
[5:41] is standing there yeah and you have to
[5:44] eat like we do go to the bathroom like
[5:46] we do you and you know the the problem
[5:49] was is the people is the same way with
[5:51] brother ground the people that were so
[5:52] close to brother Graham thought he was
[5:53] God in human flesh but still they
[5:57] couldn't understand them to be him
[5:58] because they had made him all kind of
[5:59] different things you know
[6:00] and he wasn't done there's no way it
[6:03] could be God he was born sex so he's no
[6:05] way it could be the first Lawrence on a
[6:07] god or even the second born country yeah
[6:09] amen
[6:10] so but he was one to come to introduce
[6:13] him he come to introduce was like oh the
[6:17] elephant preaching you you got we got to
[6:19] get this down right the Son of God was
[6:22] preached down through seven Church ages
[6:24] the Son of God which is God in you and
[6:27] the Holy Ghost
[6:28] right that's the son of God that's the
[6:31] creator come in and created me a new
[6:33] heart burning out the old nature and he
[6:37] comes in well now that's not the Son of
[6:39] man revelation that's the Son of God
[6:41] revelation is that God is going to save
[6:44] you because I want to read you this
[6:46] afternoon
[6:47] what we already do starting on I'm going
[6:50] to preach to them again it's alright you
[6:51] just have to be careful though you do
[6:53] have to be careful you don't want to
[6:54] give too much out then y'all could sleep
[6:56] during sex okay but remember the son of
[6:59] God in the form he was in never saving
[7:01] anybody yeah you heard what I say all
[7:08] through the Old Testament there was no
[7:10] one has salvation no no no no no no son
[7:16] of God goes all the way back to creator
[7:17] back to the beginning some of God's not
[7:20] Jesus Christ that's the heart becomes
[7:24] not getting yeah he is but at that
[7:27] dispensation he's not because the Son of
[7:30] man says I have power to forgive sins on
[7:35] the earth right the Son of God being
[7:40] forgive sins through the Old Testament
[7:43] he covered him he covered him remember
[7:48] there was animal sacrifices they only
[7:51] covered sin till the Son of God come
[7:55] into the form of the Son of Man the sea
[7:59] can save those who are lost TJ
[8:04] because the Son of God judgment was
[8:07] remember how brother Brennan said I
[8:08] always talk they don't hated me but
[8:11] Jesus loved me but I found out they were
[8:14] the same person
[8:14] well it was a different dispensation
[8:16] though under the Son of God dispensation
[8:18] of when he said let there be life you
[8:20] come through all the old testament he
[8:21] had saved one person born again you know
[8:24] number one understand what I'm saying
[8:26] born again where the soul of man was
[8:29] burnt out and God coming resided in the
[8:32] soul that can't happen under animal
[8:34] sacrifices right we're gonna read read
[8:39] Hebrews 9 and it grieves Hebrews 6 this
[8:43] is if that sacrifice had been worthy you
[8:45] could have just made one and you didn't
[8:48] have to make no more but every year that
[8:50] had to be a new sacrifice made why
[8:52] because it only covered and push to send
[8:54] to Calvary but my Christ come which is
[8:57] the son of God in human flesh in the
[9:00] beginning was the word words with God
[9:02] and the Word was made flesh you know it
[9:05] took four thousand years from verse one
[9:08] of hebrews hebrews 1 John 1 let's do
[9:13] John 1 John 1 said in the beginning was
[9:15] the word works with God heard one's own
[9:17] right in the beginning that's right here
[9:18] that's when everything was created verse
[9:21] 14 says and that word was made flesh
[9:24] there was four thousand years in between
[9:26] those scriptures but there was no
[9:28] salvation only salvation is in Jesus
[9:31] Christ hey I thought the Bible says the
[9:36] only salvation through Jesus Christ
[9:38] so Jesus Christ was who that's not a man
[9:42] that's it that's why he kept asking them
[9:46] who to use they out of the son of man
[9:48] them the only revelation they had was
[9:51] Peter in other words was saying we don't
[9:53] know exactly who you are but we know
[9:55] what's inside of you must have done
[9:58] something you're anointed you're the
[10:00] Messiah but now folks remember Peter
[10:05] said that great words those great words
[10:08] and Jesus even said Peter I'll give you
[10:11] the keys to the kingdom
[10:12] right whatever you bind on earth I'll
[10:17] bind in heaven whatever you loose on
[10:18] earth illusion heaven Peter denied him
[10:21] three times cursed him cursed right and
[10:28] when Jesus came back Peter didn't
[10:30] believe it cuz he went fishing he went
[10:33] right back to his regular normal duties
[10:35] so don't tell me that Peter had a
[10:37] revelation back in Matthew where he said
[10:39] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[10:40] Living God he did not
[10:42] that was a foretelling of God speaking
[10:46] through a man named Peter why did he say
[10:49] that why did he say that
[10:52] we're gonna cover this afternoon film he
[10:56] said upon this rock upon that revelation
[11:00] of the Son of God I'll build my church
[11:02] so it was for the churches thank you
[11:04] love them now we know Peter name begun
[11:06] the church but not in that time there
[11:09] was no kingdom there was no church
[11:11] Christ had died here
[11:13] Christ had to die to release that son of
[11:15] God the Son of man went to heaven on the
[11:19] right hand of God the Son of man deflect
[11:21] man God is now in another dimension and
[11:26] then actually making intercession for us
[11:29] because he was flesh at one time the
[11:31] stripes and all that he said back to
[11:33] some of God sent back to spirit on the
[11:36] day of Pentecost
[11:37] I wasn't son of man what I kept saying
[11:41] last Sunday the son of man revelation
[11:43] was put out of the church and he's
[11:46] standing there knocking trying to get
[11:47] back in will praise God though that door
[11:51] was sealed with seven seals that door
[11:55] was sealed with seven seals in
[11:57] Revelations 3:14 and all that through
[11:59] them that was sealed with seven seals
[12:01] there was a seventh seal mystery that
[12:04] God was trying to get
[12:06] to the church and paint God in the end
[12:09] time during the property god the door
[12:13] was open and the Son of man stepped back
[12:16] into where he's supposed to be in the
[12:17] church which is now no other time not
[12:20] even when brother Branham was here did
[12:23] they have a revelation of the Son of Man
[12:24] only way of brendham had never left but
[12:28] but I say that we did I say that we do
[12:34] now how the revelation of it son of man
[12:37] who he is what's he doing where is he
[12:39] asked I told that the other day and I
[12:43] said now if Christ asks that question
[12:46] he's asking it every service now who do
[12:50] you say I the son of man take Peter out
[12:55] of the equation now because we can now
[12:57] answer that question Peter couldn't
[13:00] answer that question Peter was just
[13:01] Peter just got an unction from God to
[13:04] speak that because jesus said flesh and
[13:06] blood didn't reveal that to you but my
[13:08] father which is in heaven in other words
[13:10] he got an option from God spoke that
[13:13] just though that he could build his
[13:15] church on the Son of God revelation yes
[13:17] alright it's really but see if you stay
[13:20] out of the Sun God revelation than you
[13:22] you must pass away and and be called up
[13:26] in the resurrection only the son of man
[13:28] has the sign of the resurrection
[13:30] how many people did the son of man rage
[13:32] when he was here everyone he ever did
[13:35] person I was reading yesterday Jazz's
[13:37] daughter the widow woman that the kid
[13:41] was going they were having a funeral
[13:42] procession and he stopped that funeral
[13:44] procession he just reached me right
[13:45] that's what I'm telling you and will
[13:48] tell you something right now
[13:49] I'll tell you this afternoon - I'm gonna
[13:52] warn you about something watch Jesus's
[13:55] life because that's the son of man's
[13:57] life
[13:58] you watch brother round in the form I
[14:00] said in the form of the son of man not
[14:02] him being the son of man but using that
[14:04] revelation he didn't have to scream
[14:06] shout or holler at a demon or of disease
[14:10] or nothing he never raised his voice
[14:13] jesus never raised his voice that's
[14:18] right and actually actually you will
[14:22] make you go a little bit further Jesus
[14:24] would just walk into a room and the
[14:26] devil started talking to him when he
[14:32] goes to the air he walks out of the boat
[14:35] and the leading man walks up first thing
[14:38] Legion says Jesus did say now you but to
[14:40] devil no Legion said why are you here to
[14:45] torment us before our time they knew he
[14:49] and they said son of God which see they
[14:51] weren't looking at the human person they
[14:52] were seeing that anointing or that that
[14:55] spirit that they dealt with listen folks
[15:00] let me be real real let me give you a
[15:04] good revelation yeah I'm gonna preach
[15:06] this in right hand they had already seen
[15:08] him back in the breed with that they
[15:12] recognize who he was and they said why
[15:15] are you here because they knew they were
[15:17] judged back in another dimension
[15:18] somewhere baloney well guys if Michael
[15:22] was Christ even looking different Jesus
[15:24] did so that's how they recognized me why
[15:30] are you coming here before our time to
[15:32] torment us now son of God can we leave I
[15:36] like it when you walk in a room and they
[15:38] won't believe
[15:40] most of the time we bring in with us I'm
[15:44] sorry but most of the time but look
[15:46] that's the son of man revelation yeah
[15:49] that's what we gotta come to see you
[15:52] next one brother branch at hospitals
[15:53] we're not going to one of the walk in
[15:55] the hospital I don't thinking and
[15:57] everybody just instantly be healed but I
[15:59] don't see why we can't be having a
[16:00] that's a discussion like this and a man
[16:04] and God walks in and starts just
[16:05] speaking the Word of God just not not
[16:07] just preach it
[16:08] excuse me talking like we're talking we
[16:11] just a talking like we're talking and a
[16:14] demon just leave the building something
[16:16] that's been bothering you how many times
[16:18] have you been in church service though
[16:19] something being bothered something
[16:20] that's bothered you and when you left it
[16:23] left what was that right what was that
[16:27] was the Neyman that walked in with you
[16:30] that was attached to you that left
[16:34] now they he's got another buddies they
[16:37] come from you know they come back but
[16:39] but that's what I'm talking about when
[16:41] we talk about the son of man don't do
[16:44] Matthew Mark Luke and John brother they
[16:45] will told us many times that's what I'm
[16:47] doing that I'm going back to Matthew
[16:48] Mark Luke and John and getting the
[16:50] character of the Son of Man if you don't
[16:54] want to know what son of man is you
[16:55] you look Matthew Mark Luke and John
[16:57] that's what he was so jesus walks up to
[16:59] Jairus his daughter they Steve's away
[17:00] he's no she's not dead that last day
[17:02] remember because of their own belief he
[17:05] had to clear the rhythm yeah they said
[17:07] for Peter James and John and him and the
[17:09] mother and the father and he raised her
[17:12] up
[17:12] well then the little guy who's had a
[17:14] funeral procession with the widow woman
[17:15] he just said hello men and he just
[17:19] reasoning to war by the hand he didn't
[17:21] shade and scream and blessed not on this
[17:23] no he just laid his hand on him and the
[17:25] kid raised bed now that is the stuntman
[17:28] revelation they had listened the Son of
[17:30] God revelation we come through Pentecost
[17:32] some of you that did come to Pentecost
[17:35] and you saw the shaking in the shout him
[17:37] to slap him in the pushing and I don't
[17:40] let the devil leave but when the Son of
[17:43] man was on earth the devil identified
[17:48] him the angel identified him and he
[17:51] identify yourself who the men say i the
[17:55] son of man ma'am even brother branham
[17:57] said many times Jesus never called
[17:59] himself the Son of God he said you say
[18:01] you say why because that was there
[18:03] that's all they could see they can see
[18:06] that that man hanging on the cross was
[18:08] gone all night eating human flesh they
[18:09] couldn't take that but that was the son
[18:11] of man and the son of God was operating
[18:14] inside of me I hope you don't know I
[18:16] hope you understand that I'm not doing
[18:17] away with the Son of God but there's
[18:19] dispensations that he works in I've read
[18:21] you that quote I'm gonna read it again
[18:25] yes previous word brother Graham City
[18:29] come in three names son of man son of
[18:30] God son of David but in between now
[18:33] according to his own word the Son of Man
[18:35] will be revealed will reveal himself in
[18:37] a different way so he's gotta reveal
[18:39] itself in a different way than anybody's
[18:41] ever seen you know Michael then they
[18:44] didn't seem as a son man when the twelve
[18:47] were walking with it who the men I say
[18:52] the son of man I am bothered we know
[18:54] you're something you know we know you're
[18:57] they watched him create so the
[19:01] revelation was now I want the Christ the
[19:03] Son of the Living God well they know
[19:04] that that was the creator something
[19:08] inside that man created but they
[19:11] couldn't understand what how it was
[19:12] connected to flesh right so I'm telling
[19:17] you when the son of man revelation comes
[19:18] known among us it's not going to be it's
[19:21] not going to be signs and wonders so
[19:24] much is that maybe it follows you but I
[19:27] was reading this morning no that's not
[19:31] where brother Adam was saying that was
[19:33] just the bait on the hook he has to be
[19:35] the message behind it brother they'll
[19:37] think reason there's a message behind
[19:39] every move of God there's a message
[19:41] comin that's it all the other stuff is
[19:43] just it's the bait on the hook but we
[19:46] want the hook the hook is the message
[19:47] and I don't know why the world I've done
[19:49] spent 30 minutes we had needles burn on
[19:51] our on our lesson well we'll get some
[19:54] more up this afternoon
[19:55] we need to understand even in that
[19:58] fourth seal that if we're out of here
[20:01] then we've come to an understanding that
[20:03] we're gone yes okay so maybe we'll get a
[20:08] little bit into the shout the voicing in
[20:10] the Trump if we can get to that this
[20:13] afternoon and if I keep you awake woman
[20:17] all right I say the truth in Christ I
[20:19] lie not my conscience also bearing me
[20:21] witness in the Holy Ghost that I have
[20:23] great heaviness and continual sorrow in
[20:25] my heart for I could wish that myself
[20:27] were accused from Christ for my brethren
[20:29] my kinsmen according to the flesh who
[20:32] are Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[20:34] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[20:37] now watch this is what oh excuse me
[20:41] mercy the Old Testament Pete Paul is
[20:44] going who are Israelites who fancied and
[20:46] the glory and the covenants that was the
[20:49] Old Testament covenants and the giving
[20:52] of the law that's the Old Testament and
[20:54] the service of God and the promises
[20:59] whose are the fathers and of whom as
[21:03] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[21:06] over all so in other words Christ came
[21:10] to what fulfill the law bring the
[21:13] promises to pass there's only one
[21:17] covenant acts 2:38 that's the only
[21:22] covenant there is repent everyone I've
[21:25] even be baptizing them in Jesus Christ
[21:26] from the making and saying you shall
[21:28] receive the gift of the whole ago yeah
[21:30] right that's all the one I want you have
[21:34] all of other covenants if you want but
[21:35] that one I want to start with all right
[21:37] because if you don't get started right
[21:39] you won't end right whose are the
[21:42] fathers and illumise concerning the
[21:43] flesh Christ came who is over all God
[21:46] blessed forever amen
[21:48] not us no the Word of God had taken none
[21:50] effect so they are not Israel all Israel
[21:54] which are of Israel now many times we do
[21:57] we fall into the same thing when we say
[22:01] well the bride looks man
[22:03] you know I did have so many things to
[22:05] manage looking bad for the varieties
[22:06] never look bad for the bride it's never
[22:09] looked bad for true Israel they were
[22:12] looking at behind the parts they were
[22:13] looking at the white the mixed multitude
[22:15] you say this in this message yelling
[22:17] I'll say right now there's more makes
[22:19] multitude than there are real breath in
[22:22] this message cuz they know about the
[22:24] letter they don't know about the word
[22:27] they're stuck in another dispensation
[22:29] they're stuck in another age not all as
[22:33] little visual so if you say well the
[22:35] bride sure looks bad the bride's never
[22:37] leave me look bad there man hey man
[22:39] they're right for an example for an
[22:46] example okay Jim's pretty in the morning
[22:51] if she isn't afternoon even though I
[23:00] know she's my bride so she's never
[23:04] looked back okay now now they sometimes
[23:22] type of crisis crisis never looked at us
[23:25] as bad never looked at us it's bad right
[23:30] these always look weirder bride
[23:32] Carrie we're the ones that attach all
[23:36] this stuff to it well I gotta do this
[23:38] and I gotta make sure this I got that
[23:40] laundry list I'll keep doing you need to
[23:41] get rid of yeah quit drinking smoking
[23:44] husband where you dress is long time
[23:45] stuff you hired don't smoke don't drink
[23:48] don't
[23:48] that's a laundry list that's bonded your
[23:53] rubber from the freighter brother hmm
[23:55] well then usually no I thought he's like
[24:01] you guys don't become 0.4 they are not
[24:06] all Israel what you're Israel so get
[24:08] what I'm saying get your eyes focused on
[24:10] the truth if you'll focus your eyes on
[24:12] the truth you'll always see the good the
[24:15] bride in good shape okay okay because
[24:18] she'll always be the word now now hold
[24:21] on a minute
[24:21] according to the dream that brother
[24:23] Brown had the bride look beautiful but
[24:26] right at the back some of them started
[24:28] getting out of step some started getting
[24:31] out of step and what did he say get back
[24:34] in staff right well that was the priest
[24:36] in the end time get back in step that's
[24:39] us I wasn't him
[24:41] give my because remember the women were
[24:44] in the back part of the procession he
[24:47] said some in the back we're getting out
[24:49] of step well it didn't make her not
[24:51] bride it just made just match you with
[24:54] having a little fault here a little
[24:55] faults there you can get back in
[24:56] together all right
[25:00] okay so not only everyone intro because
[25:03] remember when Burrell Ramsey he saw the
[25:04] first church which looked good then he
[25:08] saw the American bride which was
[25:10] horrible
[25:11] then he saw the second preview which is
[25:14] nice
[25:16] but some kind of got out of step right
[25:18] toward the end and that's our problem we
[25:20] get sometimes we get out of step a
[25:22] little bit what a step step is rhythm
[25:26] the Word of God has a rhythm to it when
[25:28] you read it it should have a rhythm to
[25:30] it he should not be scattered that's
[25:32] this is not a shotgun gospel yes the
[25:35] Gospels got away I am the way the truth
[25:37] people are many men either because they
[25:40] are the seed of Abraham are that all
[25:42] children because they're standing there
[25:44] talking to Jesus before this and they
[25:46] said we be of Abraham's lineage in other
[25:49] words he said if you didn't own Abraham
[25:51] you know me right well he one connected
[25:54] Abraham in C natural C didn't have no
[25:58] natural state but what the faith seed of
[26:01] Abraham comes all the way down to me and
[26:03] you that's right so neither because they
[26:05] are the seed of Abraham are they all
[26:07] children right there's a listen to be
[26:12] honest there's a lot of natural seed of
[26:14] Abraham that's not that this don't be
[26:15] inhale a natural seed but there won't be
[26:19] one spiritual seed of Abraham
[26:22] not one they'll all be bright or they're
[26:25] all been going other I'll be given
[26:27] eternal life but in Isaac shall thy seed
[26:30] be called
[26:31] remember the Bible says not seeds as of
[26:34] many because there was only one seed of
[26:37] Abraham that was Christ but see once we
[26:39] enter into Christ that brings us walk
[26:40] into a multiple form of just one person
[26:43] Christ Jesus amen
[26:45] that is they which are the children of
[26:48] the flesh these are not the children of
[26:51] God but the children of the promise are
[26:54] counted for the sea what was the promise
[26:57] the faith seed of Abraham that you would
[26:59] have a child now I want you to remember
[27:01] this for this is the word of promise at
[27:05] this time will I come and Sarah shall
[27:07] have a son now remember Abraham when he
[27:11] first started his journey god never told
[27:12] him he'd be through Sarah
[27:13] he just said you're gonna have a son and
[27:18] abraham tried and goofed up Hagar had
[27:23] Ishmael right at the beating of Sarah
[27:28] you're right she pushed him in to do it
[27:30] and that's where you got to be careful
[27:33] you have to be careful with that you
[27:36] know listening to that that reasoning
[27:40] right but at that time Sarah didn't have
[27:44] revelation either see Sarah was just
[27:47] like Eve she's trying to help Dodd
[27:49] promote the program he was trying to
[27:52] have God promote the program so Sarah
[27:54] had that same spirit devil that was time
[27:57] to promote the program the labor camp
[28:00] Robert Oh Sarah says hey Doc told me I
[28:01] was gonna have a promised child and
[28:04] stares like well you know you might be
[28:08] okay but me and you've been having
[28:09] relations since we were teenagers and
[28:11] when he produced nothing yet so Sarah
[28:14] goes hey doc let's try this and it
[28:20] didn't work out but we got it when
[28:23] Melchizedek coming told him sitting by
[28:26] Sarah you're gonna have
[28:27] according to the time a lot see they're
[28:30] nice
[28:30] that's why brother Brown saying that
[28:32] we'll cover that maybe later on for
[28:35] brother grounds that they were seated
[28:36] faith has to go just like Abraham would
[28:38] you have to meet mill cares that you
[28:40] have to meet dot in human flesh I love
[28:49] the thought that for a second
[28:50] but no brother Randall told us I believe
[28:53] it was in who this mill Kennedy that
[28:55] every stunt of the faith will meet the
[28:57] same journey as they for him make the
[28:59] same journey as Abraham met call he went
[29:03] through justification in time just
[29:05] forgetting st. sketch about his logos
[29:06] and then at the end he met God in human
[29:09] flesh
[29:10] now you meet Jesus same person
[29:16] labels a different flex that flex
[29:18] couldn't die for you he couldn't be our
[29:20] brother but that was gone in human flesh
[29:23] that's right all-male cast it becomes a
[29:25] male cast it became Jesus Christ man
[29:27] [Music]
[29:29] absolutely
[29:31] why would I look different Melchizedek
[29:34] is not some old well Cassidy went some
[29:37] old gray-headed looking some that's a
[29:39] reasonable question that sure true dance
[29:41] but if the Anthony of God never changed
[29:44] that's why I say God even Jesus when he
[29:47] that's why nobody knew him when he
[29:48] resurrected it was twenty years old when
[29:51] he resurrected you 130 don't look 50
[30:00] [Laughter]
[30:06] sorry so anyway when you got it just
[30:11] make sense folks because he meant of two
[30:13] of the masks in another form the Bible
[30:15] says now he wasn't in another form
[30:19] remember no one saw Jesus below twenty
[30:23] years old except Joseph and Mary Joseph
[30:26] in Mary
[30:27] I mean Joseph was dead at that time
[30:29] because he was an older man he's already
[30:31] gone
[30:33] Mary's the only one that knew who he was
[30:36] but she didn't see him till later
[30:37] remember he appeared to Mary Magdalene
[30:39] and she thought it was a gardener a
[30:41] young boy working in a rose bushes
[30:44] mm-hmm because she had seen him in
[30:47] 30-something years oh right
[30:50] but when Jesus came out of that tomb he
[30:52] wasn't no thirties he often was head of
[30:54] Christ
[30:55] that's right he look like the God who
[30:57] created everything that's what I'm told
[30:59] about Jim when she was when she went to
[31:01] that Baptist Church for a while that is
[31:05] booklet about that day and it was
[31:06] experiencing God and the person they had
[31:09] in front of that piece of paper I would
[31:11] want an evil laugh with Tuzla no he
[31:14] didn't he look like kind of but he also
[31:19] looked like wait a minute wait a minute
[31:21] wait a minute he look like what was the
[31:23] guy that slept for all that time here's
[31:29] experiencing God and this is the way
[31:31] that I look
[31:32] we've got come on the ball hit up the
[31:34] head and they're down spring oh wow
[31:35] looking like this
[31:42] sure it is
[31:43] sure news that's got mistakes on for
[31:50] Revelation now the wrong turns in that
[31:58] was that was a bad mister but not
[32:00] something against the Baptist they just
[32:01] don't have a revelation like we just a
[32:03] grade right when God said let there be
[32:05] light he would he look twenty years old
[32:07] I say because brother Ron said he was in
[32:09] the problem if we're gonna try to be
[32:10] changed back to the problem my life God
[32:14] said God's never not been a problem his
[32:16] life yes right right man so that's the
[32:20] dog we're gonna say that's the Guardian
[32:22] Abraham I mean that's the time that
[32:23] Abraham man in human flesh smell Cassady
[32:26] it wasn't milk it is a day like this man
[32:29] come on pay now in 28 days that's a man
[32:49] I won't be like right there 20 year old
[32:51] you know prime alive yeah that's Mel
[32:54] Cassady that's the God we serve
[32:56] amen they don't serve a god because they
[32:58] do like you said true if you got a
[33:00] father he's gotta look over the signs
[33:03] gotta look younger
[33:04] yeah and I don't think to have much of a
[33:07] clue what Holy Ghost in I mean you never
[33:09] see a picture that deep never listen I
[33:13] did see one picture of Melchizedek yeah
[33:15] somebody had a picture on the wall of
[33:17] Abraham Washington up heads of these
[33:19] feet and he was just a young young boy a
[33:22] 20 year old young boy now whoever got
[33:24] that got a revelation
[33:26] cuz listen be honest with everybody in
[33:29] this room until today or even before you
[33:33] got a good revelation you all thought
[33:35] Melchizedek was an older man yeah raise
[33:39] your hand never ever
[33:40] yes you did you thought he was an older
[33:43] man now
[33:45] he's a young kid and when listen when
[33:50] Joshua met the captain of the hoax he
[33:54] went all man right go that's why I
[33:56] Joshua when he pulled that sword he said
[33:58] are you for us or against us
[34:00] Wow cuz he was a formidable opponent he
[34:05] said nothing huh that was exactly the
[34:08] cross was he had just took on the form
[34:10] he took up a body just like he did milk
[34:12] after then and he was standing there
[34:14] saying nothing I'm the captain of the
[34:16] hope I'm sure Joshua then what did he do
[34:18] y'all keep reading that he took his
[34:22] shoes off because that captain said take
[34:24] your shoes off you're a holy ground now
[34:26] happen that goes back to Moses at the
[34:28] burning bush and listen if Moses want to
[34:31] have a revelation if Moses would have
[34:34] rebel a current revelation when he
[34:36] looked in that bush he was seen young
[34:37] Winston but he only saw it on fire
[34:41] because of the time of his revelation
[34:43] and you know what the time of my
[34:44] revelation could have been that dog was
[34:46] this older gentleman
[34:47] but not now no very youthful magically
[34:54] created everything that that was in the
[34:56] world and stars and knowledge staff
[34:58] laughs why would you want an old man do
[34:59] that you want somebody I think you had
[35:03] fun I'm just gonna we won't get nowhere
[35:05] there I just think God had fun I think
[35:08] he had fun he said I'm gonna put this
[35:10] galaxy over here let's move it over
[35:12] let's put 14 planets over here and let's
[35:16] have nine over here we're gonna put the
[35:18] Sun mirror
[35:20] move everything over and start here go
[35:23] over here to me that's to me that's God
[35:26] standing there just having fun
[35:28] and firing well when you brother Brown
[35:30] say his example was a child playing
[35:34] before the father doorstep
[35:39] that was the son creating all things let
[35:42] me say created a body his buddy
[35:46] sure God I listened God never had didn't
[35:49] have a body
[35:50] God always had a body even when I read
[35:52] it yesterday and I want to try to maybe
[35:54] not cover this this Sunday but you know
[35:57] Jesus told the woman at the well or
[36:01] Nicodemus a daughter's a spirit no man
[36:04] has seen God at any time well now that
[36:06] doesn't mean that he's just this cloud
[36:10] that you said no he's a person he's
[36:12] always had fingers arms hands feet eyes
[36:15] ears nose mouth whatever you want to say
[36:20] even internal organs because remember
[36:25] we're human beings and we were made just
[36:27] like see that's all right
[36:31] [Music]
[36:33] God is alive it's nothing exactly what
[36:37] he is but remember he's not a life force
[36:40] like when you see these movies where it
[36:43] like daddy always said you know you see
[36:44] this pulsating light you know where you
[36:46] see this entity floating through no he's
[36:49] a person he's he's is solid more solid
[36:52] than we are I was thinking about
[36:54] yesterday was just a Gabby's mother died
[36:56] last night famiglia didn't know that but
[36:59] they sent us to the tanks to be praying
[37:01] for him and I don't know we see I've
[37:06] salted something laying there in the
[37:08] casket and she went somewhere she's more
[37:13] solid better than she is Nick right
[37:15] because she's an eternal person right
[37:17] okay if she's born again she's an
[37:19] eternal person she's more alive now
[37:21] that's our problem we tell us she's you
[37:24] know that she's going on well that's
[37:26] fine that's okay we can we can be
[37:28] sorrowful but man we got to realize that
[37:31] that's more real than this because this
[37:34] is going to pass away that won't that's
[37:36] what a point like that is that's the
[37:37] second dimension that's not going to
[37:39] pass away that's actually going to come
[37:41] here into this dimension we're all going
[37:43] to be changed and then we're gonna go in
[37:45] a rapture but when we get let's just
[37:51] read a few ladies I'm sorry Billy Joe
[37:54] hey get your hand up
[38:01] but you were here at 9:30 comiendo not a
[38:06] god was an old man is creating
[38:09] everything will it take from an overdose
[38:17] one in the ring yeah that's the God we
[38:45] serve I mean we don't serve an old God
[38:47] we start laying the new vibrant alive
[38:51] somebody that when we get to heaven with
[38:54] him he's not gonna have to win him we're
[38:55] not gonna he's not gonna have to take
[38:57] time off to recuperate neither are we
[39:14] correct if you've heard Aaron preach -
[39:18] spend years ago all God done is stepped
[39:22] into this dimension took some dirt and
[39:24] went what did the dirt do the dirt just
[39:27] warmed around what I already will stand
[39:29] in line so Mel Cassidy look like died he
[39:34] was gone but the form look like done the
[39:37] the guy that was the the guy that was
[39:41] the captain of the hosts looked just the
[39:43] same and if you want me to prove that
[39:46] I'll let brother round improve it for
[39:48] you just before we go brother Brown
[39:50] brings the analogy of the Dead Saints
[39:53] now that Jesus when he died he went down
[39:57] to hell preach to the souls in prison
[40:00] remember he comes back up knocks on the
[40:02] door paradise
[40:04] who opens the door abraham opens his own
[40:07] now who was that stand at the door that
[40:10] was Jesus tried in history - II at 20
[40:13] years old right Abraham said look Sarah
[40:21] there's the man we faded after the
[40:30] confucius Christ that's right bi
[40:35] Abrahamson we had a castle you deadly he
[40:38] said yeah come on we got nothing else to
[40:40] be but now remember that same form in
[40:44] the form of the holy ghost has got to go
[40:46] into you now you don't take on that form
[40:48] we're not going to ever all look like
[40:50] Jesus Christ when we got female around
[40:52] right physically but to formally take is
[40:57] the form he saw and in Genesis 1:26 he
[41:00] main command and you'll never change
[41:02] from that that's what you'll be for an
[41:06] eternity there by okay well then you go
[41:09] upstairs now cuz we don't have anything
[41:10] done here old man
[41:12] [Applause]
[41:15] darling
[41:18] [Music]
