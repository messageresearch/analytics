[14:03] line uh remember all of those that are
[14:06] away for the camp meetings and youth
[14:09] camps and things will be coming back so

[14:14] uh also uh you noticed outside there was
[14:17] a motor home there don't get excited
[14:19] we're not leaving the world we just uh
[14:23] that was the gift you gave us for

[14:36] the same age on both ends you know
[14:38] backwards all right so uh you know go by
[14:41] and look at it and uh lay hands on it
[14:44] mainly and pray that the Lord would
[14:46] bless it and make everything in it to
[14:48] work all right that's what we want it
[14:50] for is to dedicate to the Lord okay have
[14:54] we got anything else
[14:57] on okay
[15:00] okay all right remember we will be
[15:03] eating together today for somebody's
[15:05] birthday all right and uh you know
[15:08] having the Easter time together so all
[15:10] that are welcome stay with us and we'll
[15:12] have a good time eating together and
[15:14] fellowshipping all right let's do that
[15:16] okay let's pray father we thank you for
[15:18] this day in your grace Lord and we thank
[15:20] you for everything and we just ask you
[15:22] to help us and guide us because we know
[15:25] that we're in an hour of time when
[15:28] things are being hustled and bustled all
[15:30] around the world and things are running
[15:34] Haywire every way we'd call it I guess
[15:37] cuz we're down at the end time but we
[15:39] just ask you to help us to get ourselves
[15:42] out of the way and to walk in the light
[15:45] of your grace and Lord that we may all
[15:48] see you living among us because that is
[15:52] the Easter's Resurrection time is to be
[15:56] that to Lord we don't put that much
[15:59] emphasis so much sometimes on the the
[16:02] times and all but because we believe in
[16:03] the resurrection all year round through
[16:06] Jesus Christ Our Lord but there is a
[16:08] time that we celebrate the Easter
[16:11] Resurrection so we ask you to just come
[16:13] now today and and raise in the hearts
[16:16] and lives of mankind because you did
[16:18] back there and now we expect it to be in
[16:21] our hearts and our lives and to know
[16:23] that he is risen again in us and living
[16:27] in US Lord you had a Resurrection
[16:30] yourself and then there's a resurrection
[16:32] for you for us Lord that we could rest
[16:34] in you forgive our sins and guide us and
[16:37] keep us in Jesus name
[16:41] amen now I want to read the entire
[16:43] chapter of Mark
[16:46] because we'll get back to it in a minute
[16:48] to where that it shows from the
[16:51] resurrection all the way in to the end
[16:53] time all right I'm not just one I don't
[16:56] generally do that I don't generally
[16:57] preach a uh service or something on
[17:01] Easter you know uh I Don't Preach like a
[17:04] Christmas message I I just whatever the
[17:07] Lord gives me I try to bring it and you
[17:10] know if it fits together on the time
[17:12] okay so this one just fits right into
[17:15] the to where we're at okay let's read
[17:18] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[17:20] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[17:22] and
[17:23] Sly had brought sweet spices that they
[17:26] might come and anoint him and very early
[17:29] in the morning the first day of the week
[17:31] they came unto the suppl at the rising
[17:33] of the Sun and they said among
[17:35] themselves who shall roll us away the
[17:38] Stone from the door of the suppl and
[17:41] when they looked they saw that the stone
[17:44] was rolled away for it was very great
[17:47] and entering into the seure they saw a
[17:49] young man sitting on the right side
[17:52] clothed in a long white garment and they
[17:55] were
[17:56] afed and he sath unto them Be not Afraid
[18:00] words don't be afraid you see Jesus of
[18:03] Nazareth which was crucified he is risen
[18:06] he is not here Behold a place where they
[18:09] laid
[18:10] him but go your way tell the disci his
[18:14] disciples and Peter that he goeth before
[18:16] you into Galilee there shall you see him
[18:20] as he said unto you see he had told him
[18:22] what would take place but they just
[18:24] didn't remember it and didn't want to
[18:26] hold on right and they went out quickly
[18:29] and fled from the supp here for they
[18:31] trembled and were amazed neither said
[18:33] they anything to any man for they were
[18:37] afraid now when Jesus was risen early
[18:39] the first day of the week he appeared
[18:41] unto Mary Magdalene and out of whom he
[18:44] had cast Seven
[18:45] Devils and she went and told them that
[18:49] had been with him as they mourned and
[18:51] wept and they when they had heard that
[18:55] he was alive and had been seen of her
[18:58] believed not see because it's hard to
[19:02] believe something it's just somebody
[19:04] else talking about it but when it's
[19:06] personal to you now that changes things
[19:10] right after that he appeared in another
[19:13] form unto two of them as they walked and
[19:16] went into the country and they went and
[19:18] told it unto the residue neither
[19:20] believed they them afterward he appeared
[19:23] unto the 11 as they said at meat and
[19:26] upgraded them with their un belief and
[19:29] Hardness of Heart because they believe
[19:32] not them which had seen him after he was
[19:35] risen and he said unto them go ye into
[19:39] all the world and preach the gospel to
[19:41] Every Creature he that believeth in is
[19:44] baptized shall be saved but he that
[19:46] believeth not shall be damned and these
[19:48] signs shall follow them that believe in
[19:51] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[19:53] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[19:56] take up serpents and if they drink any
[19:59] deadly thing it shall not hurt them and
[20:01] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[20:03] they shall recover so then after the
[20:06] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[20:09] received up into heaven and set on the
[20:11] right hand of God and they went forth
[20:15] preaching everywhere the Lord working
[20:18] with them and confirming the word with
[20:20] signs following amen you may be seated
[20:24] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[20:26] of the word
[20:30] now as I said I'm
[20:32] not I Don't Preach a message that you
[20:35] know basically when it comes say like uh
[20:39] the baby in the manger and all of that
[20:41] that's fine I don't you know the the the
[20:43] birth of a child if it falls out I
[20:46] preach maybe that in July August or
[20:47] September whatever the Lord gives me it
[20:49] doesn't matter because I'm not trying to
[20:52] emphasize that as much as I'm trying to
[20:56] emphasize a point or a thought
[20:59] for you and I now as we read about the
[21:02] disciples even some of them was there
[21:05] and if you'll take the other writings of
[21:07] the gospels you got four accounts and
[21:10] and you you got a lot of trouble
[21:12] sometimes putting this one into this one
[21:14] to that one to know which one you know
[21:17] is uh what's taking place you know to
[21:21] put them together cuz one will give one
[21:23] account this account of the two on the
[21:24] road to EMAs is pretty well over I think
[21:27] it's in Luke and it goes a pretty good
[21:29] place over into the day and getting into
[21:32] the end of the day uh of the day of the
[21:35] Resurrection but my point
[21:40] is that do we really believe he has
[21:45] risen
[21:46] now it doesn't say he has risen now the
[21:50] Bible is specific in the way that it
[21:52] says things right it doesn't say he has
[21:56] risen because that would be a p last
[21:59] time or a situation all right when you
[22:03] say he has that would mean and we would
[22:06] believe that he has risen all right but
[22:10] that's not the point it it's always he
[22:13] is
[22:15] risen see is is present tense because if
[22:19] you don't have an experience of Jesus
[22:22] Christ into your soul as the new
[22:25] birth then you don't really know that he
[22:28] he is risen you may be saying he has
[22:31] risen or was risen or could
[22:34] raise but you're you won't be saying he
[22:38] has risen unless you have something
[22:40] personal
[22:41] yourself that's why I want to get into
[22:44] that in a minute as we get down further
[22:46] in the message see I believe that
[22:48] there's proof of the
[22:50] Resurrection all right I believe that to
[22:53] be uh human beings we would be uh I
[22:57] don't like to use the word idiots or
[22:59] dumb or whatever but I guess it's a good
[23:01] point to not believe that there is a God
[23:07] you
[23:08] know because we' look at the world and
[23:10] see it we know we come from somewhere so
[23:13] then we'd have to have something to
[23:14] bring us here so whatever you'd have to
[23:16] still carry it back to find out there is
[23:19] a God to uh bring into mankind by man
[23:22] kind being here is the proof that there
[23:25] is or exist of a God uh you know not
[23:29] just a God but the God because we don't
[23:32] believe in many we believe in one true
[23:34] and living God all right but we know for
[23:36] a certain see we have proof Beyond any
[23:40] shadow of a doubt if you're a human
[23:42] mortal with a tiny bit of a brain it
[23:45] doesn't take a educated doing because
[23:48] most of the time education makes you an
[23:50] idiot because you go the wrong way with
[23:52] it all right but when you got just
[23:55] enough education to be able to
[23:57] understand right you know all right the
[23:59] in that then you can go to the
[24:01] Simplicity as I said then you can look
[24:03] around and say well we
[24:05] know surely there would be nobody you
[24:09] you say well there's people out here
[24:10] that are
[24:12] atheist I don't like that word atheist
[24:15] because how would it be that a person
[24:17] could stand
[24:19] here and stand on the earth as a human
[24:22] being and his heart beating and all of
[24:24] the things happening and not believe in
[24:26] the existence of a God to Creator to
[24:29] bring into being it would have to be
[24:31] from somewhere now you can argue whether
[24:33] this doctrine's right or that doctrine's
[24:35] right or who's right here whatever you
[24:37] know Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[24:39] Catholics or whatever you can argue
[24:41] who's got the thoughts of what's right
[24:43] that has nothing to do with
[24:45] it it has nothing to do that proves it
[24:48] to me because it proves that there are
[24:51] mankind with a brain capable of thinking
[24:55] about something or a situation so it
[24:59] doesn't matter how much how many more
[25:00] doctrines you've got that alone is proof
[25:04] that God does exist because it it means
[25:07] to mankind that's reason the animal the
[25:09] animal can't think you know the dog the
[25:12] cat you think well my little dog it's
[25:14] it's a pretty little dog it can talk
[25:17] yeah you can teach a bird to talk but
[25:19] you better to be careful what you say it
[25:22] might do some talking to let everybody
[25:23] know what you've been talking about it
[25:26] might say some of your words
[25:29] uh had an cousin that she was bad to say
[25:33] a certain thing well you could walk in
[25:34] that house and that old parakeet he let
[25:36] her out well you know who it was it was
[25:38] talking it was her all right but now
[25:42] listen we know that there is a God we
[25:45] would have to agree with that there's
[25:46] proof that there is a God without any uh
[25:49] thoughts or ideas you say well well
[25:51] prove to me that there's a God is your
[25:53] heart
[25:53] beaten right well a dog's heart's beaten
[25:56] that's right cuz God gave him thaten
[25:58] right you know where would you be how
[26:01] would you be alive if it was not a
[26:03] Creator are you the Creator see that's
[26:06] what I've always said I don't believe in
[26:08] in in U atheists I believe that there's
[26:11] a lot of
[26:12] idiots because really if you're an
[26:14] atheist and don't believe in God you're
[26:16] you have to be believing that you're
[26:17] Superior amen because you're Superior to
[26:20] everybody else in the world that thans
[26:22] about a God so you're Superior so what
[26:24] are you trying to do make yourself
[26:26] God that solves that
[26:29] and that's Satan's idea just developed
[26:31] into mankind all right but now
[26:36] listen I said we've we I read the entire
[26:39] 16th chapter because it
[26:44] covers the
[26:46] Resurrection the events that took
[26:49] place proof that those things took place
[26:53] by people seeing him after he raised all
[26:56] right the Bible said he was seen of over
[26:58] 500 Brethren now that that was you know
[27:02] enough to let you know that the he a lot
[27:04] of people seen him after he rais all
[27:08] right but now he didn't just raise to
[27:12] tell us a thought or an
[27:15] idea he he raised for a specific
[27:19] purpose all right now keeping it into
[27:23] the line of thought then as Jesus raised
[27:28] now what did he say he said now it'll
[27:32] come a time it'll all end up we'll do
[27:34] this that and the other and he said 'I
[27:35] leaving you but said I'm coming back to
[27:37] be in you and said what you've seen now
[27:41] out here you will see it in the people
[27:45] the disciples the the church you know
[27:47] the early church he was telling them
[27:49] that those things would take place all
[27:52] right we go and we all we want to do is
[27:55] be like I said idiots about things
[27:57] instead of leaving the Bible to believe
[28:00] be it we want to take well Mark 16's not
[28:04] inspired we have proof the last few
[28:08] verses is not
[28:10] inspired
[28:12] well does that mean that you're smarter
[28:15] than
[28:17] mankind I'd even give you Scofield if
[28:19] you want to go back to him he said this
[28:21] Mark 16 was quoted in its entirety by
[28:25] irenius
[28:28] now look on your board back there and
[28:29] you'll see irenius was right there with
[28:31] polycarp which was right there with with
[28:33] the disciples because he was the second
[28:35] Church age messenger all right he was
[28:38] still alive in other words he'd seen
[28:39] Jesus he'd seen so he was quoting that's
[28:41] enough for me but I my point is one
[28:43] thing why do you want to argue
[28:46] that what would be the purpose of
[28:48] arguing whether Mark 16 is inspired or
[28:52] not you're trying to disprove the word
[28:55] of
[28:56] God you're trying to to disprove some
[28:59] way or to make some way to try to show
[29:01] how smart you are okay well what good is
[29:04] all of
[29:06] that you know what good is it what is
[29:09] good has it done for you it just made
[29:12] you uh a person to be able to say well I
[29:15] I saw that well what good is that you're
[29:19] going to face that maker one day with
[29:21] your thoughts all right now so then what
[29:26] are we getting at
[29:28] proof of a
[29:31] resurrection as I said Mark there 16 we
[29:34] want to read the first few verses and we
[29:36] talk about his
[29:38] resurrection and we'll go with that but
[29:40] then we'll drop down to the last of it
[29:42] and we'll get to well we don't believe
[29:44] that whether that's inspired or not I
[29:47] like the way the lady said that time you
[29:49] know when her son told her that Mark 16
[29:51] wasn't inspired at the Li and she shed
[29:54] started shouting Glory Hallelujah
[29:56] because she'd just been healed
[29:58] and said if God can heal me with part
[30:00] word what can he do if we got it
[30:02] straight so that's the point you know
[30:05] the point is to believe in God not to
[30:07] believe in ourselves or our ideas or
[30:09] whatever our concept see when you're out
[30:12] and you're you're doing you you know
[30:15] yourself that sometimes you finally
[30:17] settle down and and you maybe you might
[30:19] be in the middle of the night or you
[30:20] might be in this or that or the other
[30:22] but then you start
[30:25] thinking right because that's a human
[30:27] being
[30:28] and you start thinking about God in his
[30:32] doings the way he does
[30:35] things you know really you're you're
[30:37] looking at him through what has been
[30:40] made known to you by
[30:43] somebody well my point is what you know
[30:48] yourself there's not a person sitting in
[30:50] this building that has not had one way
[30:53] or the other an
[30:56] experience something that happened
[30:58] something took place something we could
[31:01] talk about for hours of you know I was
[31:05] at this point of death and it was
[31:07] brought back this would happen here and
[31:10] we saw it come back to correct see then
[31:13] there's no need of talking about whether
[31:15] there's a God or not we realize there is
[31:18] we got the proof that there is all right
[31:21] but see he didn't just leave it that
[31:24] way when he went to his resurrection he
[31:27] didn't didn't say well now this is me
[31:29] I'm going to raise you believe this one
[31:31] day we're going to
[31:33] heaven that's kind of way mankind
[31:35] believes it right well you just believe
[31:37] in
[31:38] God you know and you're going to heaven
[31:42] cuz you know they've done away with hell
[31:43] because nobody's going there anymore you
[31:46] don't go to a service anymore and hear
[31:49] somebody say well this person here died
[31:50] and went to hell of course there ain't
[31:52] no need of hatching out bones over a
[31:54] dead person there's no need of doing
[31:56] that but you know what I'm talking about
[31:59] everybody's going to heaven it don't
[32:00] matter what even if you have to like I
[32:02] heard of a person one time said well
[32:04] they paid the parking lot well praise
[32:06] the Lord the parking lot got paid but is
[32:09] that going to send you to heaven
[32:12] no that's that's not the point the point
[32:15] is that I believe down through time from
[32:17] the very
[32:19] beginning that he made the statements
[32:22] that he would raise while he was in his
[32:24] life right you know he talked about his
[32:28] resurrection while he was in his life
[32:30] with the disciples
[32:32] amen well it evidently didn't don't on
[32:36] him too good because after his
[32:40] burial they were kind of down and out
[32:43] right right well that's could be
[32:45] understood see death the burial and
[32:49] thing it could kind of that's kind of
[32:50] understandable that they would be that
[32:52] was but what about somebody started
[32:54] saying well we seen
[32:56] him we seen him that's
[32:59] right but you know that still doesn't do
[33:01] any good until something happens within
[33:03] you that you can believe
[33:05] it you know a lot of people just can't
[33:07] believe that's right I mean that's
[33:09] that's true about a lot of people just
[33:10] can't believe that's right because they
[33:12] just well I don't know where to believe
[33:13] or not I don't know what it is you
[33:15] know but see the point I'm getting at
[33:19] what is your proof of the
[33:21] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[33:23] talk about an Easter time we talk about
[33:25] a resurrection but what is it about
[33:27] that's right basically it's about
[33:29] whether he was crucified Thursday Friday
[33:31] Saturday Monday Tuesday whatever day it
[33:33] is they're arguing over that then they
[33:36] argue with this happened here and this
[33:37] happened there we just don't really know
[33:39] well you know that's true they don't
[33:42] know but see then some people begin to
[33:46] believe and that's kind of way it was
[33:48] with the disciples after hearing some of
[33:50] the others they begin to
[33:52] believe and they were gathered together
[33:55] when he appeared to
[33:56] them and I like the way scoffield
[33:59] defines that I don't take all of those
[34:01] things but he defines that like a is not
[34:04] necessarily where it says the 12 he says
[34:07] over in the other scripture when it says
[34:08] 12 number he said that means there was
[34:11] 12 of them but said when this says the
[34:14] apostles see because a lot of them
[34:16] didn't
[34:18] believe right you remember the story in
[34:21] a different accounts where that Jesus
[34:23] appears to them Judas is not with I mean
[34:25] um uh who's the one put your hand in
[34:29] Thomas Thomas Thomas is not with him
[34:31] then he appears another time Thomas is
[34:33] with him so you got all of these
[34:35] different
[34:36] accounts that shows it but it comes
[34:38] forth to show one
[34:40] thing he came to those disciples after
[34:43] his resurrection and they still didn't
[34:45] believe it that's
[34:50] right they get on over to his Ascension
[34:53] in the in the book of of Acts where he
[34:56] starts up and they're still at that time
[34:59] and this is the Ascension going up and
[35:01] they're staying what are you going to
[35:03] restore the kingdom to Israel at this
[35:04] time see they still thought about
[35:06] Earthly things they had no thoughts and
[35:09] here's a man fixing to go up in the sky
[35:11] to leave the
[35:13] Earth and promised he would come
[35:15] back but I there interested in it who's
[35:18] going to run the government who's going
[35:19] to be in the white house right is that
[35:22] about the way it is now who's going to
[35:24] be the president who's going to be here
[35:26] and what's going to be that's for all
[35:28] that's well and good but what does that
[35:30] matter but my point is what see in even
[35:36] after his
[35:39] resurrection to those that would
[35:43] listen he told
[35:45] him go ye into all the world now this
[35:48] the Holy Ghost hadn't come yet on the
[35:50] day of Pentecost that's right but he
[35:52] told him we ready turn tomorrow go you
[35:54] into all the world even if you don't
[35:56] believe the last few few verses if I
[35:58] read these at least agree with the first
[36:01] few verses as being authentic and he
[36:05] says go you and you know teach them and
[36:08] everything go you into all the
[36:11] world but he said I'm going to come
[36:14] back and I'm going with you you're not
[36:17] going to be by yourself so I promised
[36:19] that while I was here I promised I'd
[36:21] come and live in you
[36:24] amen and he said I'll be with you always
[36:27] that's your scripture it didn't say
[36:30] always it said means it's far from here
[36:34] to there that's just means the distance
[36:36] of what you're going all right but see
[36:38] in the Resurrection The Lord Jesus said
[36:41] now
[36:43] look the things I've
[36:46] done they seen the dead raised the sick
[36:49] healed all manner of signs and wonders
[36:51] by the Lord Jesus right right and he
[36:53] said you'll do this
[36:55] amen you'll do these things and said the
[36:58] reason you'll do him he said because I'm
[37:00] going away but I'm coming back and I'll
[37:01] be with you and even in you to the end
[37:04] of the world that's way his
[37:06] statements so he was saying don't worry
[37:09] about you trying to figure out how to do
[37:11] it right cuz you can't figure it out you
[37:14] can't do it see because we can't do them
[37:17] things it's by him coming back and
[37:20] living in
[37:24] you him coming back and living in you
[37:28] so what was the proof of the
[37:32] Resurrection are you with
[37:35] me if you don't have a proof of the
[37:37] Resurrection where are you you just got
[37:38] a Doctrine an idea or a concept of
[37:40] something you're just depending on what
[37:42] so and so says and we read this and he
[37:44] says so and so we read that and he says
[37:46] so and so and we get all bungled up and
[37:48] don't know you know our minds in the
[37:49] garbage camp and we don't know what's
[37:52] the truth
[37:55] amen but you see what was
[37:58] his point of what he was bringing to
[38:02] them I'll be with
[38:05] you even in
[38:07] you right
[38:09] sir go up into Jerusalem and Wait Don't
[38:13] Preach no more don't do none other the
[38:15] things just hold off go up to Jerusalem
[38:18] and wait cuz I've got something I've got
[38:20] to
[38:21] do right cuz it was not all finished at
[38:24] that time that's right even after he had
[38:27] resurrected and everything he said I've
[38:29] got some things I've got to do that's
[38:31] right I got to deliver up this part here
[38:33] I've got to go and I've got to take all
[38:35] of these things but said I'll be
[38:37] back that's right I'll come back and
[38:40] I'll live in you amen that's right
[38:43] what's the proof of the
[38:45] Resurrection what's the proof of whether
[38:47] Jesus was God or who or whatever is
[38:49] doing what is your proof about
[38:55] God Buddha talks about about it
[38:59] hey under this Doctrine under that
[39:01] Doctrine you're promised these things
[39:03] that's right you go down to the
[39:04] mohammadans and different things what
[39:06] you promised all the men is get 70
[39:08] virgins I never have found out yet what
[39:10] they said to women yet but you know
[39:14] that's beside the point is just always
[39:15] trying to contact the
[39:17] man but see they got promises that's
[39:22] right you remember when Billy Graham was
[39:24] trying to to there to trying to talk to
[39:27] those people and they said well you
[39:28] promis this and you promis that said you
[39:30] promis a life after we got a life after
[39:32] promised by
[39:36] Muhammad Billy Graham had to back off
[39:38] and leave because he could not
[39:42] produce what they were looking
[39:45] for brother R said why in the world
[39:47] didn't he just stand there and call for
[39:50] it don't you believe God would have come
[39:53] on the scene if he had just been honest
[39:54] enough sincere to call for it I believe
[39:56] he would
[39:59] I believe he would have come on the
[40:00] scene but he wasn't sincere enough see
[40:02] because there's something about to
[40:04] experience the disciples what were they
[40:08] running like a bunch of chickens with
[40:09] their head cut off that's right scared
[40:11] to death right you know what I'm talking
[40:14] about after the the the death of Jesus
[40:17] they I mean they just dispersed they
[40:19] just went Every Which Way and even after
[40:22] his resurrection and appearing to him
[40:25] the best they could do was Peter
[40:27] you know what Peter said I go
[40:31] fishing
[40:33] right I mean I go fishing sure you can
[40:36] analyze all that thing and say well he
[40:38] believed he met Jesus while he's fishing
[40:39] so he's going back to fish now you can
[40:41] do all that you get all that theories
[40:43] into your mind but what good is it Peter
[40:46] just didn't believe him
[40:50] right
[40:54] right cuz you know what it's impossible
[40:56] to believe God without God being in
[40:58] you that's the point of the
[41:01] resurrection of whether or not there was
[41:03] a resurrection we can talk about a
[41:06] resurrection we could have viewed it
[41:08] right we could have been there I've been
[41:09] in was in the Philippines one time when
[41:11] they come up to the Easter time and oh
[41:15] man they just they go through a great
[41:17] thing I mean they they start early in
[41:19] the morning and they just start beating
[41:21] themselves and they start these things
[41:23] and going across their back and and it's
[41:25] it Just Tires out the flesh and they
[41:28] just bleeding all over the place I'm
[41:29] talking about riding down the road in
[41:30] the car from here to there and the blood
[41:32] splattering on you all day long they're
[41:34] doing those things they get over in the
[41:36] middle of the day to show how sincere
[41:38] they are on up in the day and they got a
[41:40] little paddle they showed us they got a
[41:42] little paddle and it's got little pieces
[41:43] of of uh glass stuck in the end of it
[41:47] and I seen them do it they would go lay
[41:50] down on the ground and a little child
[41:51] would take that and slap them on the
[41:53] back with it
[41:57] well then when they got up and started
[41:59] moving
[42:00] twisting blood started running out
[42:06] sincerity we watched a man and it was 12
[42:08] or 13 times that he had been hung on a
[42:11] cross or 12 or 13 maybe 14 years he had
[42:14] went through this same thing to
[42:16] represent Jesus and I have the video
[42:19] showing it pulled in right onto the
[42:21] nails they drove nails they were not
[42:24] drown nails and and they put them in a
[42:26] certain place and pushed him through
[42:28] yeah but they still took his like a
[42:30] knife blade looking thing and they went
[42:32] through his hands and put him on the and
[42:34] then tied him up there and put him on a
[42:35] cross and held him not 5 Seconds not a
[42:38] they were there for quite a while maybe
[42:41] 10 15 20 minutes that he was hanging up
[42:44] there to represent his belief in Jesus
[42:51] Christ but what did he do after the
[42:53] service was over all he wanted was the
[42:55] glory that he'd been put on the cross 15
[42:57] times 14 times and I'll do it next year
[42:59] you know that's all he
[43:02] wanted there was no sincerity in their
[43:06] lives cuz if it was why wouldn't it
[43:08] accept Jesus Christ and and want to do
[43:11] but what is your proof of the
[43:12] Resurrection amen that's
[43:16] right what is your proof that Jesus
[43:19] Christ
[43:21] raised well I read about it I heard
[43:23] about it I've been there yeah I've been
[43:25] in the Tomb thank God I get to see them
[43:28] things thought you didn't haven't done
[43:29] it I walked in the Tomb and stood in the
[43:31] tomb where that they had had him laying
[43:33] in the
[43:35] grave been there in the garden been all
[43:38] those
[43:39] things but you know
[43:42] what after all of that and I thank God
[43:46] for being so wonderful to tell us he
[43:47] knew more about the scriptures he could
[43:49] quote more scriptures than I could I
[43:51] mean he was just a walking Bible he said
[43:54] he dedicated his heart to the Lord on
[43:56] and I not believing in Jesus Christ now
[43:59] right he's a Jew right he said he
[44:01] dedicated his heart to the Lord 14 13 14
[44:04] years before to tell the Christians
[44:05] about their land and he said this is
[44:07] your land he said we're not going to the
[44:10] Via Delarosa because I do not know for
[44:12] certain that's where he
[44:15] walked he said what I tell you I can
[44:17] prove that it was there that was
[44:21] wonderful but it never converted
[44:24] him I did get to see him do something
[44:27] when we were in where they had put Jesus
[44:28] and supposingly let him down in a hole
[44:31] to keep him overnight you know and they
[44:33] told us and and the wall was the wall
[44:35] was just like a man that was Bloody
[44:37] leaning up against the wall a form of a
[44:41] man he wouldn't go down in there with us
[44:44] cuz they didn't let us down they'd
[44:45] opened a way up and you walked in you
[44:47] know and I was videoing it and I wanted
[44:50] to do it anyway cuz I figured he was
[44:51] somewhere around but you know we were
[44:54] talking about the where they put him in
[44:56] there and all and I'm doing this just
[44:58] telling you a story and I go this and I
[45:00] see him U right and I go he didn't want
[45:02] it I
[45:05] go I locked right on him and him
[45:07] standing up right
[45:10] looking he claimed he didn't believe in
[45:12] Jesus but he knew more about the
[45:14] scriptures than I
[45:17] did he would tell you the things that
[45:19] took place and he didn't read his Bible
[45:21] he got up every day we got up and got in
[45:23] the bus to go he read the Bible of where
[45:25] or quoted the scriptures where we were
[45:29] going but yet he believed in a in a God
[45:33] cuz we were sitting at the place where
[45:35] the where the demons were cast out and
[45:37] went into the swine and run down the
[45:39] hill and drowned themselves you remember
[45:40] that in the
[45:41] Bible and here was a Jew that claims he
[45:44] doesn't believe in Jesus
[45:46] Christ he said oh yeah I believe in
[45:48] Jesus Christ existed he said I'm trying
[45:51] to tell you he existed said I'm trying
[45:53] to tell you he lived and these are the
[45:55] things that he done he just didn't
[45:57] believe in him as a
[45:59] savior that day he said they have proven
[46:02] right here that they brought a machine
[46:04] out here just recently and said there is
[46:07] an unknown Force right here in this
[46:09] place he said I can feel it right
[46:13] now he was a
[46:16] Believer you I've told you about it that
[46:18] he he had a bad rice on his body and he
[46:21] said he was taking two or three baths
[46:22] every night with hot water if you ever
[46:24] have a rice on you the best thing to do
[46:25] is turn the water as hot as you you can
[46:27] get it and just put it on that spot and
[46:29] just keep you know and it will take away
[46:31] the burning from you and he said I'm
[46:33] doing that every night I said well
[46:35] Reuben I said you're talking about
[46:37] telling us about that Jesus was here and
[46:39] existed he said
[46:40] yes I said but we believe that Jesus
[46:43] said to lay hands on the sick and they
[46:46] shall
[46:47] recover I said do you mind if we pray
[46:50] for
[46:52] you he said oh no that I want you to but
[46:56] didn't give it myself if we prayed for
[46:57] him the next morning when he come
[46:58] walking down I said hey Ruben how you
[47:00] doing this morning didn't I take no bass
[47:03] last
[47:04] night we saw miracles happen there
[47:09] prayed for a girl to receive the baptism
[47:11] of the Holy Ghost right there where
[47:12] Jesus was that Paul the name was excuse
[47:15] me Paul was at that one
[47:17] cesaria but listen what is my point if
[47:21] you don't have a proof of a resurrection
[47:23] what good is to talk about a
[47:24] resurrection what is the the good to
[47:26] talk about baby laying in a
[47:30] Manger that baby laying in a Manger
[47:32] can't die for your sins he had to grow
[47:34] up long enough to become an adult and
[47:37] live his life he done that for you and I
[47:41] like the prophet would say he said he
[47:42] was a child unto a child he was a
[47:44] teenager to a teenager said he's an
[47:46] adult unto an adult he went through all
[47:48] of those things in life right to live
[47:52] and
[47:54] all but he had proof of the Resurrection
[47:58] listen before he
[48:01] raised all right you with
[48:03] me the proof of the Resurrection before
[48:06] he raised he raised the dead he healed
[48:08] the sick do you believe that you believe
[48:11] he done those things the Bible said he
[48:13] did see he had proof before he ever even
[48:16] come to the resurrection what about
[48:18] after the
[48:21] resurrection after the resurrection see
[48:24] then he told us that we would have that
[48:27] Authority given unto us Amen to lay
[48:30] hands on the sick and they shall
[48:34] recover I you want to stand here all
[48:36] afternoon and talk about the things that
[48:38] we've seen that God has
[48:41] done
[48:47] thank we don't talk about a god of
[48:51] History a god of History will do you no
[48:53] good I'm kind of like the fell was that
[48:55] said you know they talking to him but
[48:57] you got to you got to go through this
[48:58] you got to go through the Virgin Mary
[49:00] you got to go through these angels or
[49:01] whatever people you know to get to God
[49:03] he said when I'm in trouble I don't want
[49:05] no secretary that's right and that's
[49:07] trueth that ain't a joke I want to go to
[49:09] the head man talk to him
[49:11] myself right I don't want to have to go
[49:13] through somebody that might mess it up
[49:15] and especially when the computer age it
[49:17] really could get messed up couldn't it
[49:19] you know file it up and then you
[49:21] want all across your screen but listen
[49:24] what am I talking about
[49:27] I'm talking about what is your proof of
[49:28] the Resurrection what good is it to you
[49:30] to talk about a resurrection if you
[49:33] don't have proof of
[49:36] it right right we've seen the dead
[49:39] raised we've seen the sick healed amen
[49:43] and a word y just this little group amen
[49:50] amen you said but I just don't believe
[49:52] that well see that's all right a not
[49:55] trying to make you believe nothing
[49:57] I'm just trying to get you to listen to
[49:59] God and see what he says about
[50:01] it he promised it why can't we believe
[50:04] it well you could have f it well let's
[50:06] see you do
[50:08] it I'm not sarcastic nor hateful I'm
[50:11] just saying let's see you do
[50:13] it none of us can do anything except
[50:16] what God gives
[50:20] us
[50:23] right what God gives us
[50:27] because he promised to do that he said
[50:29] I'll be with you even in
[50:32] you don't you worry about it so don't
[50:35] worry about you go to courts and this
[50:36] that and the other he said just wait
[50:39] said I'll be there to take care of it
[50:41] right you know they bring you before the
[50:43] law and things don't argue with them
[50:45] don't fuss with them just wait on him
[50:47] he'll give you the answer amen right see
[50:50] we want to do some mental buildup in our
[50:53] minds and try to think about a God but
[50:56] but is that God
[50:59] real what's the difference in
[51:01] imagination about a God or an
[51:03] imagination about Buddha being
[51:06] God come on what's the
[51:10] difference what's the difference in in
[51:12] believing this or believing that when it
[51:14] won't produce
[51:19] right but see we talk about him being
[51:22] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[51:23] and forever but what about the proof of
[51:25] the Resurrection
[51:31] amen what about the proof of the
[51:36] Resurrection because see I believe all
[51:38] the way down to time that there's been a
[51:41] living God living in The Bride of Jesus
[51:44] Christ to fulfill his
[51:46] workj we look down through the Dark Ages
[51:49] and we look at them and those people
[51:50] during that Dark
[51:54] Ages they lost their lives they gave
[51:56] their lives for the
[51:58] gospel take animals and tie them
[52:01] together to a man and just pull him
[52:03] apart read Fox's book of Martyrs and
[52:05] just see about it okay that's supposed
[52:07] to be
[52:12] authentic take and rip a baby out of a
[52:14] mother and throw it to a hog and feed
[52:19] it those people had something that's
[52:21] right that was real right do you think
[52:24] what we've got it would be able to stand
[52:25] the test of that
[52:27] right would it stand the test when they
[52:28] put a gun to your head and said deny
[52:30] your
[52:31] faith you know there was a lot of them
[52:34] did and there was a lot of Records in
[52:36] into the fox and book of waters in a
[52:38] time that a lot of them
[52:41] recanted and then a lot of them came
[52:43] back later and accepted Jesus Christ
[52:45] well that's great that's
[52:49] wonderful but I thought we was to
[52:51] believe in a God that was living what
[52:53] good is a God that you can't get in
[52:55] touch with him and he can't do anything
[52:56] thing for
[52:59] you right I mean what what's a need in
[53:02] believing in a God if you don't believe
[53:04] he can do something for you right want
[53:06] serve him what's the
[53:09] purpose if you can't call him on the
[53:11] scene what's the purpose of even trying
[53:12] to talk about him that's
[53:15] right brother around preached a message
[53:17] one time says raising God from
[53:20] history in that message he was
[53:22] explaining what he meant of saying
[53:24] raising God from history he said he had
[53:26] become historical God to
[53:30] mankind he never bothered me when what
[53:32] was his name alhiser Altier whatever it
[53:34] was they said God is dead back in the in
[53:37] the
[53:39] 60s I a got no problem with
[53:42] that you said well Boy tell you no I
[53:45] have no problem with it because I know
[53:46] he was dead to most
[53:49] people the most people God was dead and
[53:51] that was the point that he was making
[53:53] not that there was not no God he was
[53:55] making the point that there was that God
[53:57] was dead in the lives of the people
[53:59] that's right well that's right is he
[54:03] dead in your life or is he there for you
[54:05] when something
[54:08] happens and like I said have you ever
[54:10] had something really happen that you
[54:11] knew was Supernatural and could not be
[54:15] explained right and how you come out of
[54:17] a wreck how you come out of a of this or
[54:20] that or the other or supposed to been
[54:21] shot supposed to been this that or the
[54:22] other and you come walking out of it
[54:24] without any problems
[54:29] what about proof of a
[54:31] resurrection see
[54:33] truly it says back there he is
[54:39] risen now is that true today to you and
[54:43] I is he's risen today in your thoughts
[54:46] and
[54:49] ideas everybody wants people to try to
[54:52] believe a Doctrine or an idea what good
[54:54] is a doctrine of an or an idea if
[54:56] there's no living God to be with
[55:01] that
[55:03] right well y'all spent a lot of time
[55:05] talking about Prophet brandom you know
[55:08] and all the things that he done well
[55:10] that's
[55:11] true I like to talk about Paul I like to

[55:24] there one of those those guys wouldn't
[55:26] even read a newspaper he said there was
[55:28] no use in
[55:30] it I guess he's about right cuz it was
[55:32] no truth in it cuz you can read one day
[55:34] what something happened you read the
[55:35] next day and somebody done changed it
[55:37] right is it true what can you depend
[55:42] on but you see one of those had SE 16 or

[1:00:11] anything you tell me to do except
[1:00:12] certain things it ain't going to be no
[1:00:14] damage to
[1:00:16] me why because I'm not concerned with
[1:00:18] that why because it was all settled a
[1:00:20] long time
[1:00:21] ago I know who the healer
[1:00:24] is I went in one time I told one doctor
[1:00:27] I said would you believe that my blood

[1:00:50] would you believe God heal me he said no
[1:00:56] what he said I didn't it didn't it
[1:00:58] didn't fluster me I didn't put up no
[1:01:00] arguments I just walked out and told my
[1:01:02] wife I said if you expect me to go to
[1:01:03] the doctor you going to get me another
[1:01:04] one cuz I ain't going to an
[1:01:06] idiot he's at least got to be a
[1:01:08] believer you know that's what I told at
[1:01:11] heart specialist when I got to he said
[1:01:12] hey look said I'm a Christian I said
[1:01:15] well great then we can
[1:01:16] talk you're not the Healer right cuz
[1:01:20] that was settled a long time ago with
[1:01:21] God we know who the healer is we know
[1:01:25] who does the signs and
[1:01:26] wonders we know who it is that's living
[1:01:29] in inside of
[1:01:33] us that way I'm not SC scared of
[1:01:37] n not afraid of those things that most
[1:01:40] of you go haywire when things go wrong
[1:01:43] why it going to hip
[1:01:46] you no it's going to make it worse
[1:01:48] you're going to get frustrated and
[1:01:50] that's worse on you than
[1:01:51] anything best thing to do is just sit
[1:01:53] back and say thank you Lord that's right
[1:01:56] you hurting sometime just say thank you
[1:02:01] Lord you know what I developed years ago
[1:02:03] I come find out I'll tell you the story
[1:02:05] I I found out this a long time ago if
[1:02:08] you're hurting in a certain spot just
[1:02:09] rub
[1:02:11] it you know just rub
[1:02:13] it just gently rub that
[1:02:17] spot and I can show you where that there
[1:02:21] was a great big pone sticking out right
[1:02:23] there and I kept rubbing and it's gone
[1:02:27] right I was sitting talking to that
[1:02:30] heart specialist one day about some
[1:02:31] things you know he said Sam he said you
[1:02:34] know what said them black spots on you I
[1:02:36] said yeah I know getting
[1:02:38] old he said next time you hit yourself
[1:02:40] said just rub
[1:02:43] it I looked at him I said you mean
[1:02:45] you've come up with this I said I've
[1:02:46] known that all along I just I get hurt I
[1:02:49] just rub it try it sometime don't run to
[1:02:51] the house I'm Hur I'm Hur just rub it
[1:02:57] right because it's all in God he gave
[1:02:59] your body healing
[1:03:02] factors CA an immune
[1:03:05] system cuz he knew we'd need
[1:03:11] it but see why don't you try
[1:03:14] praying why don't you try thinking him
[1:03:16] for
[1:03:18] it CU according the way I read the Bible
[1:03:21] I'm supposed to what even for salvation
[1:03:24] I'm supposed to do what I'm supposed to
[1:03:26] believe in my heart that Jesus Christ is
[1:03:29] raised from the dead Romans what 8 right
[1:03:31] in there I'm supposed to believe that
[1:03:34] God died for
[1:03:36] me and I'm then I'm supposed to confess
[1:03:38] it with my
[1:03:40] mouth right all right that's where your
[1:03:42] healing comes
[1:03:45] amen your healing comes from the basis
[1:03:48] that you believe that he died for you
[1:03:51] and then you confess it right right
[1:03:55] thank you Lord am the Bible said he what
[1:03:59] makes intercession upon what our
[1:04:03] confessions right now listen I'm honest
[1:04:06] I I always Tred to just be
[1:04:08] truthful the Bible doesn't say if you're
[1:04:10] a Christian and you confess that God
[1:04:12] will heal
[1:04:14] you now that's extra because you got a
[1:04:17] closer run right you understand what I
[1:04:19] mean you're closer to him if you're a
[1:04:20] Believer but if you're not a Believer
[1:04:22] won't you start confessing It
[1:04:23] Anyway won't you try that even if you're
[1:04:26] not a
[1:04:27] Christian say well thank you Lord right
[1:04:31] you know what you might confess your way
[1:04:32] under
[1:04:33] salvation you know he might contact you
[1:04:35] somewhere that's right but what are you
[1:04:37] saying proof of the Resurrection
[1:04:41] amen is the Christ that's living in you
[1:04:45] cuz that's what it's been all the way
[1:04:46] down through time cuz that's what he
[1:04:48] said I'm going away but I'm going to
[1:04:50] come back and I'm going to live in you
[1:04:51] yes sir
[1:04:53] amen he said that's going to be proof of
[1:04:56] the Resurrection the things I do what
[1:04:59] does the Bible say you shall do
[1:05:01] also and what does it say greater right
[1:05:05] not because we could do something
[1:05:07] greater but because there's more of us
[1:05:09] right there was one of him now there's a
[1:05:11] bride around the
[1:05:13] worlden confess your way into healing
[1:05:16] confess your way into salvation
[1:05:20] yes right
[1:05:22] amen won't you brag on him a little bit
[1:05:29] right now Gina is it so that you can
[1:05:32] brag on Mark and get what you
[1:05:36] want she don't like me I just talk
[1:05:38] playing to
[1:05:40] her but it's true ain't it it sure ain't
[1:05:43] true that you go tell the B then try to
[1:05:46] get something you understand Zach and
[1:05:49] Anna you don't go around with I don't
[1:05:51] like no you brag on each other and then
[1:05:54] you pretty well get what you
[1:05:58] want
[1:06:00] amen well is not is not that true with
[1:06:04] God
[1:06:05] right don't you think he wants to be
[1:06:08] bragged
[1:06:11] on you don't ever thank him for what
[1:06:13] he's done for you right you don't don't
[1:06:16] ever thank him for saving you you don't
[1:06:19] ever thank in him for for healing you am
[1:06:22] sister cetus sitting back there 90 years
[1:06:24] old takes no medicine
[1:06:26] right now she' tell you she's not
[1:06:29] against medicine that's
[1:06:33] fine well you know it might just be our
[1:06:36] confession it just might be what we
[1:06:38] believe it might be the resurrection
[1:06:40] working right it's proof of the
[1:06:43] Resurrection anyway anyone that's healed
[1:06:46] anywhere by anything what methods or
[1:06:48] whatever took place is a direct proof
[1:06:51] that the
[1:06:52] resurrection he is risen that's right
[1:06:56] yes
[1:06:58] sir
[1:07:00] right direct proof that he is
[1:07:04] risen not talking about he has risen or
[1:07:07] will raise or whatever no amen but he's
[1:07:11] risen right
[1:07:14] now what good is salvation without a God
[1:07:16] that's
[1:07:18] risen you don't have
[1:07:20] none the best way to say
[1:07:22] it you don't have anything right
[1:07:27] what does Easter mean to
[1:07:29] you I like what brother WBY used to say
[1:07:31] he said never did understand how they
[1:07:33] had them eggly and
[1:07:34] rabbits but you know you go around for
[1:07:38] Easter and everybody's got egg lay and
[1:07:40] rabbits well what good is an eggly and
[1:07:42] rabbit I hadn't found one yet but what
[1:07:45] good would it be if it was
[1:07:47] true what about a living
[1:07:50] God that will come and live inside of
[1:07:54] you hey
[1:07:56] come on I'm talking
[1:07:58] plain if you've never had an experience
[1:08:00] with God he'll come to you somewhere
[1:08:04] right he'll give you a change that's
[1:08:07] right amen and you'll know it right
[1:08:11] amen he'll talk to you and he'll know
[1:08:16] it he'll come and he'll try to reason
[1:08:20] with
[1:08:21] you and try to show you what the truth
[1:08:24] is amen
[1:08:27] that heaven help you to turn it down
[1:08:28] that's right right just don't turn down
[1:08:31] when he comes to you to talk to you amen
[1:08:34] amen you don't have to be able to
[1:08:37] understand this or understand that or
[1:08:38] all about God and and all of this and I
[1:08:40] don't understand this or understand that
[1:08:41] what y'all talking about that ain't got
[1:08:43] nothing to do with it that's
[1:08:46] right it has because it's God's word but
[1:08:49] the truth is is whether or not you can
[1:08:51] accept Jesus Christ I like the way the
[1:08:53] prophet said it in Christ of Min God
[1:08:54] reveal he said said he could be revealed
[1:08:56] to the most illiterate
[1:08:58] person now that's the kind of God that
[1:09:00] our Prophet we talk about believed
[1:09:03] in we talk about an illiterate person we
[1:09:06] think well they can't be
[1:09:07] saved why not
[1:09:12] amen are you the one that decides
[1:09:14] whether or not they
[1:09:17] can the most illiterate person can just
[1:09:20] actually see God living in a reality
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:26] but you know what's the greatest
[1:09:27] Resurrection sign there is Christ Living
[1:09:29] in you living before your neighbors your
[1:09:33] brothers and sisters your family living
[1:09:35] in you to show Jesus Christ that's
[1:09:38] right hey we're all failures no problem
[1:09:42] don't talk to me about well we're not
[1:09:45] perfect well according to the Bible he
[1:09:47] says we are so now you're going to argue
[1:09:49] with him right he said be you therefore
[1:09:51] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:09:53] perfect right well you know how can a
[1:09:56] person be
[1:09:58] perfect by a
[1:10:01] sacrifice that was made that's
[1:10:05] right right am even the Indian with the
[1:10:08] totem pole come on I Tred to te I try to
[1:10:12] be sensible even an IND an Indian with a
[1:10:15] totem pole he believes that that
[1:10:17] imaginary God in there can speak to him
[1:10:19] and you know what he
[1:10:23] can it might be be in imaginary ways but
[1:10:26] still it can
[1:10:31] work well what about believing in the
[1:10:33] real
[1:10:37] God what about it come on musicians
[1:10:41] think on these things what does a
[1:10:43] resurrection mean to
[1:10:52] you we've seen healings and signs and
[1:10:55] wonders amen that are unquestionable
[1:10:58] that's
[1:10:59] right
[1:11:02] right we've seen things happen that is
[1:11:08] unquestionable but why don't we believe
[1:11:10] in that God
[1:11:12] Amen why don't we say thank you
[1:11:15] Lord and just come and speak to
[1:11:18] me just remember in the middle of the
[1:11:20] night he'll come to you
[1:11:24] hallu you said well how do you know the
[1:11:26] difference between God and the devil
[1:11:27] talking cuz the devil can talk too yeah
[1:11:30] that's good he
[1:11:32] can but just
[1:11:35] remember the devil will always be trying
[1:11:37] to destroy you with his
[1:11:41] words God will always be trying to lift
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:48] up so what I I've been a Christian a
[1:11:50] long time and this this Voice keeps
[1:11:52] telling me I'm lost well

[1:12:01] down off the cross and I'll hear it I
[1:12:02] mean come down off this mountain here
[1:12:04] and I'll take care of this I'll do all

[1:12:11] are why not just be a Christian
[1:12:14] amen and let Christ live in you
[1:12:18] am we can't manufacture things because
[1:12:21] that's not according to
[1:12:23] truth but we can believe that God can
[1:12:25] take care of all things
[1:12:29] amen and he will amen if we'll let
[1:12:35] him let's stand what we got brother
