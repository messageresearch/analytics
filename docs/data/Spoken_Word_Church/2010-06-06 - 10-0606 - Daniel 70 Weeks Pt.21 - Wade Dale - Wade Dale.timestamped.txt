[0:00] okay all
[0:03] right morning
[0:05] everyone morning all right let's turn
[0:09] to where we were last
[0:12] Sunday in Daniel and read that first
[0:18] um have stand
[0:20] about that it get you yeah I'm not
[0:24] worried about me I just wanted to see
[0:26] the board we're just experimenting today
[0:28] so
[0:34] this is a test this is only a test the
[0:37] emergency broadcast
[0:45] system
[0:52] right Daniel 9:24 and what we're going
[0:54] to do is is we're going to pretty much
[0:57] try to nail this down go over what we
[0:59] went over the last
[1:01] Sunday again just for the sake of
[1:04] getting it on the video and then maybe
[1:07] start something
[1:09] else next
[1:11] week
[1:14] um Book of Daniel
[1:20] 9 cuz I want you to see one thing um and
[1:24] Daniel and I want to read you a quote
[1:27] before we get started from the prophet
[1:30] in questions and answers this is where
[1:32] everybody goes to when they are
[1:35] questioning whether there's one week
[1:37] left after the Rapture or three and A2
[1:39] years but watch this
[1:41] key walk over there next to that Co to
[1:44] go open watch this key well I just
[1:47] wanted to get here watch the
[1:49] key in questions and answers in 1964
[1:53] they asked him a question brother
[1:54] brandham when you gave the message on
[1:56] the 70 Church weeks 70 weeks pardon me
[1:59] of Daniel
[2:00] I believe that you mentioned that the
[2:02] full last week or last seven years will
[2:04] begin when the bride was taken in the
[2:09] Rapture technically he
[2:12] did because there's one week left after
[2:14] the Rapture he said that over seven
[2:16] times in the Daniel 7 week series but
[2:19] now watch what his mind goes to watch
[2:21] this right here no no no n nigh nay you
[2:24] got that wrong not the full seven weeks
[2:28] the week started when Jesus Jesus came
[2:30] on
[2:33] earth now that's not true according to
[2:36] what he preached in the six in the 70
[2:39] weeks of Daniel not saying the prophet
[2:41] was wrong but if the week started right
[2:43] here you need to eras all this and get
[2:45] rid of everything he preached that whole
[2:46] week what's he
[2:48] saying he's saying there's only one
[2:51] important
[2:52] week
[2:54] listen the week started when Jesus came
[2:57] on Earth in other words that preaching
[2:59] right here here of the three and 1/2
[3:00] year Ministry of Jesus Christ River
[3:03] Jordan we explain that he said to
[3:06] Messiah Prince you'll come and
[3:07] prophesying in the midst of the seven
[3:09] weeks he'll be cut off and Jesus
[3:10] preached exactly 3 and A2 years which is
[3:13] half of the 70 weeks or the seven days
[3:16] week week days and there's three and 1/2
[3:19] years
[3:21] left but he said the week started when
[3:24] Jesus came on earth now the natural
[3:27] weeks of 70 weeks of Daniel we prove
[3:30] started back in BC whatever it was 536
[3:33] or 584 or whatever it was back here
[3:37] according to Daniel in the time the
[3:40] weeks the time all
[3:43] right but what's brother brandham
[3:45] speaking
[3:47] of he's speaking of what we were talking
[3:50] about last week and that is
[3:56] there's a week of the Messiah or the
[3:59] Messiah s week
[4:02] right all
[4:04] right and what is a week it's
[4:08] um seven years one
[4:12] week equals 7 years that's what we
[4:15] started way back over here all right or
[4:18] the whole 70 weeks of Daniel the Prophet
[4:20] is bringing into one week all right one
[4:23] week so there's one week left for
[4:26] Earthly time but there's only 3 and 1/2
[4:28] years of Jesus is Ministry left
[4:32] because this was probably a gentile
[4:35] asking him with the question and a
[4:36] gentile it doesn't matter about this
[4:38] last
[4:39] week of Earthly time because if that
[4:42] Gentile is born again he won't be here
[4:44] we won't be here but if you don't get
[4:46] this first
[4:48] half what Jesus preached right here if
[4:50] you don't get this first
[4:52] half you won't go in a Rapture here
[4:55] right so let's read now and let's let's
[4:57] go through it step by step
[5:00] kind of conclude
[5:02] everything 70 weeks Daniel 9:24 70 weeks
[5:06] are determined upon thy people upon thy
[5:08] Holy City to finish the transgression
[5:11] make an end of sins make reconciliation
[5:13] for iniquity bring an everlasting
[5:15] righteousness seal up the vision and
[5:16] prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[5:20] know therefore and understand that from
[5:21] the going forth of commandment to
[5:22] restore and to build Jerusalem to the
[5:24] Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks
[5:26] and three score and two weeks all right
[5:28] seven weeks
[5:30] three score and two 62 that equals 69 69
[5:34] weeks all right or 483
[5:38] years all
[5:40] right the street shall be built again
[5:42] the wall even troubless times now this
[5:44] is for Daniel and his people we get the
[5:47] spiritual aspect of it they get the
[5:49] natural aspect of it and after three
[5:52] score in 2
[5:53] weeks shall masi be cut off here at
[5:57] Calvary but not for himself and the
[5:59] people of the prince that shall come
[6:01] shall destroy the city in sanctuary and
[6:03] thereof shall be with a flood until the
[6:04] end of the war desolation are determined
[6:07] and he that's a little age shall confirm
[6:10] the Covenant with many for one week
[6:12] that's not Jesus Christ that's the
[6:14] Antichrist he'll confirm the covant for
[6:16] one week you and I Gentiles that's not
[6:18] to us we will not be here now Gentile
[6:21] bride won't be here Gentile Nation will
[6:23] be here Gentile bride will not be here
[6:26] during that last week cuz we get this 3
[6:30] and 1/2 year message of Jesus Christ
[6:32] somewhere else like we spoke of last
[6:35] week and in the midst of the weak he
[6:38] shall cause the sacrifice and oblation
[6:39] to cease for the overspreading of
[6:41] abomination he shall make it desolate
[6:44] even until the consummation and that
[6:45] determin shall be poured upon the
[6:48] desolate so now let's turn
[6:51] to Genesis where we were last last
[6:58] week
[7:04] and being a beautiful type in the Old
[7:08] Testament I hope those of you on the
[7:10] internet can see the board cuz we're
[7:11] going to be drawing on it but and can
[7:14] hear the only speaker we have on this
[7:16] one's right here that's why I'm having
[7:17] to talk a little bit loud CU it's not
[7:19] hooked up to here it's hooked up to
[7:21] there in Genesis
[7:25] 29 now let's set a stage here all
[7:28] right
[7:29] if if we take what the prophet put on
[7:32] the board and the chart and what he
[7:35] preached in Daniel 70
[7:38] weeks this is what it looks like and
[7:40] that's what it'll be because we read
[7:42] remember last Sunday and we won't read
[7:43] it this Sunday but if you go over into
[7:46] what was it
[7:48] Matthew where Jesus they asked Jesus
[7:50] says how many times should you forgive a
[7:53] brother seven times he said no 70 * 7
[8:00] what's 70 * 7 490 all right so you got
[8:05] 483 years it's just striking that Jesus
[8:08] said that forgiveness would be finished
[8:10] in 490 years or 70 * 7 forgiveness all
[8:15] right what is 483 years plus one year
[8:18] left after the Rapture exactly 490 years
[8:22] all right so that restores Israel back
[8:25] because remember make an end of sin
[8:27] reconciliation for forgiveness BR
[8:29] Everlasting right what's that
[8:31] doing that's forgiving us right
[8:34] Redemption is forgiving you for what you
[8:36] done and brought you back to your
[8:38] original condition all right so that's
[8:41] what we're looking at so so now let's
[8:44] really not take any more of these dates
[8:46] and times but let's look at it as what
[8:50] happened in the Old Testament
[8:52] between
[8:54] Jacob and these two wives Rachel and
[9:00] Leah now in Genesis
[9:04] 29 uh you can start at verse one CU
[9:08] Jacob went on a
[9:10] journey he came into the land of the
[9:12] people of the East and what'd he
[9:14] do he found this lady in verse 10 that
[9:17] came out with her father's
[9:20] sheep and Jacob saw Rachel the daughter
[9:22] of laan verse
[9:28] 10 his mother's Brethren the Sheep of
[9:30] laan his mother's Brethren that Jacob
[9:32] went near and rolled a stone from the
[9:34] Well's mouth and watered the flock of
[9:36] laan his mother's brother and Jacob
[9:39] kissed Rachel and lift up his voice and
[9:41] wept so who was he after Rachel called
[9:45] his eye right okay and Jacob told Rachel
[9:49] that he was her father's brother and
[9:51] that he was Rebecca's son and she ran
[9:53] and told her father they were all kin
[9:55] folk
[9:58] right and it came to pass when laan
[10:00] heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's
[10:02] son that he ran to meet him and embraced
[10:04] him and kissed him brought him to his
[10:06] house and he told laan all these
[10:09] things and laan said unto him surely
[10:11] Thou Art my bone and my
[10:13] flesh and he Abode with him the space of
[10:16] a month and laan said unto Jacob because
[10:18] Thou Art my brother should us thou
[10:20] therefore serve me for not tell me what
[10:22] shall thy wages be and laan had two
[10:25] daughters the name of the
[10:27] Elder was Leah now what what's the
[10:30] older Israel Israel's the older remember
[10:36] even in Malachi it say it's going to
[10:37] turn the hearts of the of the fathers to
[10:41] the children but the children to the
[10:43] fathers right right what the old fathers
[10:46] back the people the the Israel is the
[10:48] oldest Nation Israel is the one that
[10:51] that God spoke of
[10:53] first so Leah was the oldest and the the
[10:59] name of the younger was
[11:00] Rachel all right the name of the younger
[11:02] being
[11:04] Rachel then we look at a gentile bride
[11:07] and then we look at the Jews as being
[11:12] Israel so there's your type all right
[11:14] that we begin
[11:16] with now Leah was tendere eyed but
[11:19] Rachel was beautiful and well favored
[11:22] and Jacob loved Rachel he said I will
[11:24] serve thee seven years for Rachel thy
[11:26] younger
[11:27] daughter laan said it is better that I
[11:30] give her to thee than that I should give
[11:32] her to another man abide with me and
[11:37] Jacob served seven years for Rachel and
[11:39] they seemed unto him but a few days
[11:41] remember we said last Sunday a thousand
[11:43] years is a day a day is a thousand years
[11:46] Jesus didn't mind waiting 2,000 years to
[11:48] get his
[11:52] Rachel but coming into the order of
[11:54] things just like why didn't Boaz
[12:00] take
[12:02] Naomi no Boaz took Ruth Naomi was older
[12:08] right typing of the Jews but he had to
[12:11] he took that younger wife to Bear a
[12:13] child to give to Naomi which we'll see
[12:16] that in just a minute in typ same
[12:19] here Jacob served seven years for Rachel
[12:22] they seemed unto him but a few days for
[12:24] the love he had for her Jacob said unto
[12:26] laan give me my wife for my days
[12:29] fulfilled that I may go in unto her lean
[12:31] gathered together all the men of the
[12:33] place and made a feast and it came to
[12:34] pass in the
[12:35] evening then he took Leah his daughter
[12:38] and brought her to him and he went in
[12:40] unto her and laan gave unto his daughter
[12:43] Leah zela the ma for a handmade and came
[12:46] to pass and in the morning behold It was
[12:48] Leah and he said to lean what is this
[12:50] thou Hast done unto me did not I serve
[12:53] with thee for Rachel wherefore then hast
[12:56] thou begal me laan said must not be so
[12:59] done in our country to give the younger
[13:01] before the firstborn look at verse 27
[13:04] fulfill her weak now there's where we
[13:07] come to fulfill her week well what was
[13:10] her week years seven years so brother
[13:13] Bram said seven one week equals seven
[13:16] years that's in the Bible it just took a
[13:19] prophet to glean that out of the
[13:22] Bible we might have read it a million
[13:24] times we read Lord Jesus Christ baptism
[13:27] a million times right
[13:29] but it never stuck until the prophet
[13:31] showed us the order of how that
[13:33] scripture was the only scripture to be
[13:35] baptized right in the name of Jesus
[13:38] Christ all right same way with this
[13:40] we've read this many many
[13:42] times fulfill her weak and we will give
[13:45] thee this also for the service which
[13:48] Thou shalt serve with me yet seven other
[13:53] years now in the natural that might be
[13:57] 14 years but in the spiritual we're
[13:59] going to look at just one week or seven
[14:03] years because brother randam said here
[14:05] he said the week started when Jesus came
[14:07] on the earth now not when he came on the
[14:10] earth as a
[14:12] baby the week started when he started
[14:15] preaching right here was when he started
[14:16] ministering his
[14:18] gospel excuse me and that's when the
[14:21] week started
[14:23] because he said the Messiah would be cut
[14:25] off which he was and he was killed
[14:29] and then you've got a natural happening
[14:31] here but then the spiritual happening is
[14:33] here with you and I now why do we call
[14:37] it what is the Messiah the anointed one
[14:39] or what is the Messiah it's shows a sign
[14:42] right it's a messiah sign there's only
[14:46] three times that you're going to get the
[14:47] Messiah sign just like Jesus Christ did
[14:51] one time you're going to get it with the
[14:52] Lord
[14:53] himself one time you're going to get it
[14:55] here in the end time with a little
[14:56] Prophet called William brandom which she
[14:58] had the Messiah sign right he told the
[15:00] secrets of the heart nobody else was as
[15:02] accurate as he ever was all right then
[15:05] you've got two prophets going to Israel
[15:08] taking the same Messiah sign to Israel
[15:12] all right so now you've got a gentile
[15:15] bride which we'll see here in type is
[15:18] Rachel because
[15:20] Jacob typ in Christ he worked and
[15:23] labored all through these Church ages to
[15:25] try to get a gentile
[15:27] bride had his eye on her the whole time
[15:30] I
[15:31] believe but he hadn't to come in by the
[15:34] law that he created he had to pick up a
[15:38] um um an the older Israel you said oh
[15:42] well Israel was the apple of his eye no
[15:43] before the foundation of the world there
[15:45] was only a certain amount of names
[15:47] written in the book and that was not the
[15:49] 144,000 are the
[15:51] Jews it was you and eye the bride he had
[15:54] his eyes on us
[15:56] first but being God he comes down and
[15:59] says Israel is my people I'm going to
[16:01] marry her she's here she's the older and
[16:04] I'm going to come down and I'm going to
[16:06] save her and Redeemer but what happened
[16:10] right here they cut him
[16:13] off right so we proved last time that
[16:16] there was no way that he could take her
[16:19] back at this time he could not take her
[16:21] back as a wife he divorcer in the Old
[16:23] Testament to do what to get a gentile
[16:27] bride
[16:29] so he goes and he works his
[16:31] time laan pulls a squin on him and gives
[16:34] him Leah which would which would have
[16:36] broke the type cuz La said I can't give
[16:39] you the younger it's our custom to give
[16:42] the older I can't give you the younger
[16:45] he just didn't tell him that to start
[16:47] with but still what a perfect type this
[16:49] is so what did what did he do he worked
[16:53] seven basically this is what he done he
[16:55] worked seven years for this one right
[16:57] for Leah and he worked seven years for
[17:01] Rachel right all right now let's bring
[17:05] it together and see let's read the rest
[17:07] of it
[17:08] verse 28 and Jacob did so look how great
[17:12] now if it had been me and you what would
[17:14] we have said forget it I'm out of here
[17:17] I'm going to just take both of them and
[17:18] I'm out of here no no no Jacob was a
[17:21] type of Christ remember his name changed
[17:23] to Israel perfect type of Christ
[17:27] Jacob the the Patriarchs all the all the
[17:30] tribes had to come through Jacob and his
[17:32] concubines and Rachel and Li
[17:36] right so now let's read and Jacob did so
[17:40] and fulfilled her a week and he gave him
[17:43] Rachel his daughter to wife
[17:45] also so now what
[17:48] happened he went in to live he worked
[17:51] seven years for her he went in seven
[17:53] years worked and he got Rachel so it
[17:56] says here and he went in also under
[17:58] Rachel verse 30 and he loved also Rachel
[18:01] more than
[18:03] Leah brother brand said he loves his
[18:05] bride more than the servants cuz that's
[18:08] the way you you in the in the Book of
[18:10] Revelation that's the that's the way
[18:11] people sometimes they get Israel and the
[18:13] bride mixed up he said Israel are Israel
[18:17] is
[18:18] servants you and I are bride we stay in
[18:22] the temple with him we are we we
[18:24] minister to him in the
[18:26] temple you know your wife ministers to
[18:29] you in your home right she's not your
[18:32] servant I hope not
[18:40] okay told somebody the other day when we
[18:42] were talking about something and they
[18:43] were talking about
[18:45] U
[18:46] um ways to be more Amorous toward your
[18:49] mate and they were talking about going
[18:51] to Victoria Secret and going to this and
[18:54] doing this and doing that I said put on
[18:56] an
[18:57] apron put put on an apron get you a
[18:59] towel and some
[19:02] Windex and go to the kitchen start
[19:05] washing the dishes and I'll guarantee
[19:08] your night will be a whole lot better
[19:09] than it will going and looking for all
[19:11] that other stuff all
[19:14] right put that on the
[19:20] internet but look he the whole point was
[19:25] he worked seven years to get one and he
[19:28] worked seven years to get the other now
[19:30] Jesus Christ is not going to work 14
[19:33] years all right but this is what he did
[19:37] and we were showing it last
[19:42] week what finishes this thing one week
[19:46] equals 7 years or the 70 weeks of Daniel
[19:49] can be summed up in one week or in seven
[19:53] years all right which is Jesus Christ
[19:56] preached three and A2
[20:03] all
[20:04] right then he preached the same three
[20:06] and A2 again he's going to that's your
[20:09] base that's your base this is the base
[20:12] right
[20:17] here and then brother
[20:19] random you said there was seven years
[20:22] left no I didn't there's only three and
[20:25] 1/2 years
[20:26] left right
[20:30] mhm of a messiah week we prove that
[20:33] there is definitely one week left after
[20:35] the Rapture a few subjects
[20:38] before but this is important this is
[20:42] important and there's one other part
[20:44] that's important you and
[20:47] I got the same three and a half year
[20:49] Ministry of Jesus Christ when brother
[20:51] renam came on Earth preached his message
[20:53] not in the years of preparation he said
[20:56] but when he begins to bring his message
[20:57] and in other words the seals and all the
[20:59] things that Jesus Jesus preached six
[21:01] seals brother Brandon preached six seals
[21:04] and these two witnesses will be the six
[21:07] Seals All right you understand that
[21:09] brother Jo I'm not TR to be funny
[21:13] that
[21:16] who
[21:18] who Jacob yeah well that polygamy was F
[21:21] in the Old Testament I mean polygamy was
[21:23] fine back then but it's not now but
[21:26] Jesus won't have two
[21:28] we're talking about now we're not
[21:30] talking about natural things we're
[21:31] talking about Redemption all right
[21:33] Redemption is David could have 500 wives
[21:38] but they could only have one husband
[21:40] right you and I are millions of bride
[21:44] but we only have one husband but Jesus
[21:46] has many brides right but he only has
[21:49] one wife right that's
[21:53] all one wife now do I no that shouldn't
[21:57] even be be wi shouldn't be disc this
[21:59] ain't got nothing to do with that let's
[22:00] just throw that out of the way people
[22:02] we're not talking about sex and having
[22:05] wives and forget it this is spiritual
[22:08] we're talking about spiritual things
[22:09] here not worried about having I wouldn't
[22:11] want to
[22:14] L I hope all the men would
[22:17] say and the women would say
[22:21] Amen see
[22:24] there we proved that point not even out
[22:27] the Bible
[22:29] prove that point naturally right brother
[22:32] Ray but
[22:34] look in the Old Testament now that you
[22:36] brought it up in the Old
[22:39] Testament it was not illegal to
[22:43] have many wives David had
[22:47] 500 we're talking about this guy having
[22:50] just two but now see that's why we don't
[22:53] need to get get into that cuz they don't
[22:54] have time people don't bring that up no
[22:56] more because because you got Rachel had
[22:59] a concubine or a handmade and Jacob had
[23:02] babies by her this ain't got nothing to
[23:04] do with this Daniel 70 week just clear
[23:07] that out of your
[23:10] head back where he
[23:16] was had to happen on
[23:22] video okay but
[23:25] anyway Jesus Christ came on Earth and
[23:28] preached three and 1/2 years to redeem a
[23:32] gentile bride and I need to clear this
[23:36] up
[23:41] to that's 144,000 that's not all Jews
[23:48] okay but they fell as tribes back in the
[23:51] Old Testament when he divorced Israel
[23:54] Israel were saved Israel was saved as a
[23:58] nation and lost as a nation right right
[24:01] so now you and I we are saved as an
[24:04] individual lost as an individual uh I'm
[24:07] not saved because brother Donnie's saved
[24:09] but now these 144,000 there's only going
[24:12] to be 12,000 per tribe not going to be
[24:15] 12,000 one or one less it's going to be
[24:17] exactly that many so God is going to
[24:20] bring that many people
[24:21] in so Jesus come and preach three and A2
[24:25] years all right then he was cut off that
[24:30] same three and 1/2 year message was
[24:32] preached down through 2,000 years but
[24:34] the Messiah sign nobody could take a
[24:36] Rapture with that because what happened
[24:39] to Jesus when he got finished preaching
[24:40] that three and A2 years what' he do he
[24:43] took a Rapture right right all right now
[24:46] what happens after the three and A2
[24:48] years is preach to the Gentiles we take
[24:50] a Rapture right what happens after three
[24:53] and A2 years preach to the Jews they
[24:56] take a Rapture right all right so we got
[24:59] to get this right here
[25:01] straight so he comes and preaches he's
[25:05] cut off from this group of people this
[25:07] group of people accept him and then at
[25:09] the end time we got a little Prophet
[25:10] that comes and preaches the same Messiah
[25:14] message and there's your seven all right
[25:17] take your same three and a half that
[25:19] Jesus preached can't do away with that
[25:21] you say well it's it's not another three
[25:22] and A2 you know I thinking about this
[25:24] other day yes it is another three and A2
[25:26] because Jesus preached and out of that
[25:29] three and A2 years we've had billions of
[25:32] sermons preached just out of three and a
[25:33] half that's all this world is right is
[25:35] based on Jesus preached for three and a
[25:38] half years and every sermon that was for
[25:43] you know coming forth out of the Bible
[25:44] in other words think how many times
[25:46] that's been preached through here
[25:49] Baptist Methodist Pentecostal doesn't
[25:51] matter Lutheran they're all they all
[25:56] base sure you got your Old Testament but
[25:59] what did Jesus preach in that three and
[26:00] A2 years preached all the Old Testament
[26:02] brought it into the New Testament and
[26:04] and made it
[26:05] alive all right so that's all you got
[26:08] but it's an expounding of that three and
[26:11] 1/2 years all
[26:13] right because right here
[26:16] remember you said well brother Brown
[26:18] preach he didn't couldn't preach three
[26:20] and a half years cuz the seals were in
[26:21] March and whatever I've heard people go
[26:23] off on that remember it's 1260 days
[26:29] not our three and 1/2 years right God's
[26:33] prophetic three and 1/2 years not our
[26:34] three and A2 years this won't be our 3
[26:36] and 1/2 years we will not look on a
[26:38] calendar and if you're here you can look
[26:40] on a calendar and you can count it up on
[26:43] the calendar and it won't be right but
[26:45] this is 1260 days according to the Bible
[26:47] right right all
[26:49] right so now we got us when we go up in
[26:53] a Rapture when this three and 1/2 years
[26:56] is Quicken to us by what the prophet
[26:58] preached we'll go on a Rapture right
[27:01] right then what will he do he'll take
[27:04] that excuse me that same three and 1/2
[27:06] years and where's he going to go he's
[27:08] going to preach for 1260
[27:10] Days to Live are the Jews cuz he's got
[27:13] to get her to get to get her time and
[27:17] that's seven right so brother
[27:21] random you said the seven that there was
[27:24] seven years left after the Rapture he
[27:27] said no didn't he said the week started
[27:29] when Jesus preached right they get the
[27:32] last
[27:34] half everybody see that that's the last
[27:36] half right there half of seven is three
[27:39] and A2 all right
[27:43] so all this right
[27:46] here is
[27:52] redemption in one
[27:55] week or what is one week equal
[27:59] seven
[28:01] years that's the whole Daniel 70 weeks
[28:04] in a
[28:05] nutshell whatever puts us in a
[28:09] Rapture is going to put the Jews in a
[28:14] Rapture pretty
[28:16] simple all right any
[28:19] question now remember we're still in
[28:22] time I know 490 years 77s is 49 that's
[28:26] still in time that's the seventh day
[28:28] that's Millennium even the Millennium
[28:30] all the way to the white Throne judgment
[28:31] is going to be that 490 years right all
[28:34] right the 50th is when that new city
[28:37] comes down and we walk into that new
[28:39] city where there's no sin see during all
[28:42] this time even in the millenum you've
[28:43] still got the devil here you've still
[28:46] got things that's going to happen you
[28:47] got a white Throne judgment where people
[28:49] are giving eternal
[28:51] life but we can't get here without
[28:55] understanding this right here
[28:58] now two great things that comes out of
[29:00] this to prove this is right Rachel Leah
[29:05] has a bunch of them I'm not going to
[29:06] name them they they call them out in the
[29:08] Bible Leah had a bunch of the 12 tribes
[29:11] Reuben she had the first one which is
[29:12] the oldest right but Rachel had two
[29:15] which was
[29:17] what
[29:19] Benjamin and
[29:26] Joseph all right Benjamin and Joseph the
[29:29] only two Rachel had and when Rachel had
[29:31] Benjamin she
[29:33] died yep
[29:35] right Benjamin brother Brenham said
[29:37] types to
[29:39] 144,000 Joseph typed
[29:43] Christ
[29:45] right so out of this Gentile bride we're
[29:48] to birth Christ and what's Christ going
[29:50] to do out of us we're going to just now
[29:54] we're going to go back to Ruth and Boaz
[29:57] Ruth and Boaz had a child and who they
[30:00] give it to they give it to the old Mama
[30:03] Naomi right cuz they missed it the first
[30:07] time
[30:09] right but you got to get it the second
[30:12] time to finish the Redemption because
[30:15] sure sure Boaz raised his hand up and
[30:19] did all his right of
[30:21] redemption but remember what he was
[30:23] doing he wasn't redeeming Ruth
[30:27] right right he was redeeming Naomi right
[30:32] Naomi's was the property remember uh
[30:34] Ruth was the
[30:39] daughter-in-law a great
[30:41] thing because out of that though God had
[30:45] to take the
[30:47] younger to birth a bride to give it to
[30:50] the Gentiles
[30:52] so um Ruth and Boaz had to get get
[30:59] together get together in spirituality
[31:02] like you and I and the bride Christ and
[31:04] the bride
[31:05] together and then we just hand over what
[31:08] is birth in us we just hand it over to
[31:09] the
[31:10] Jews that finished the Redemption right
[31:13] Redemption wasn't finished when Ruth and
[31:15] Boaz went in the bedroom that finished
[31:18] Ruth that restored Ruth back to whatever
[31:20] Boaz had she didn't get Naomi's property
[31:23] she got what boas had right okay Boaz
[31:28] just did the type of redemption to let
[31:32] Naomi to get what she had lost right I
[31:36] understand
[31:38] that Ruth got
[31:41] Christ heirs and join HS it don't say
[31:45] that about Israel you and I are HS and
[31:48] join HS with Jesus Christ so when Ruth
[31:51] married Boaz that made
[31:53] them
[31:55] equal she got what Boaz had now Boaz was
[31:58] a mighty
[31:59] man but now no a no am it Naomi didn't
[32:03] get what Boaz had Naomi got restored
[32:06] what she lost which was
[32:08] what right of being a
[32:11] wife she got it restored now not complet
[32:14] to be restored to being where he took
[32:15] her as a wife too but at least she had
[32:18] the child and she had a she she was
[32:20] restored when that child was laid in her
[32:23] lap everything was put back together
[32:25] just like it was supposed to be
[32:28] cuz without that without Boaz neither
[32:31] one of these would have had
[32:33] anything
[32:35] right I mean without Jacob neither one
[32:37] of these wouldn't have had children
[32:39] because of the way the lineage was same
[32:42] with Boaz if Boaz and Ruth hadn't had
[32:44] their hadn't had that child give it to
[32:47] Naomi restored
[32:51] everything if we don't see Redemption
[32:53] this is my whole point if we don't see
[32:55] redemption in every dock
[32:57] doine in every word of this Bible if we
[33:01] don't see Redemption if we don't see
[33:03] redemption in all the prophets
[33:06] message then then we've missed it yep
[33:09] right if we don't see that God came from
[33:12] way back in his mind to redeem man you
[33:16] me Israel the
[33:19] Sinners
[33:21] everybody and this Bible shows you a
[33:23] pathway back to full restoration
[33:28] be it Jews or Gentiles Jews or
[33:31] Gentiles names you know we just use we
[33:34] use names as types but you know put your
[33:35] name in there well no holding your hand
[33:39] up okay I was thinking now you know we
[33:41] talk about this today and it's all
[33:43] spiritual for us but those people
[33:46] carried children and gave them away sure
[33:50] absolutely first born and we
[33:54] talk y but that was
[33:57] was what was supposed to happen back
[34:00] then you raised up children for your
[34:03] brother if your brother died if I died
[34:05] Terence was supposed to go in with June
[34:07] and raise up a child but that child
[34:09] wouldn't be terence's that child would
[34:11] be mine right cuz she's raising it up in
[34:14] my name all right there a beautiful part
[34:17] to that but we ain't got time to get
[34:18] into that but thank you all for coming
[34:20] this morning we'll see how this turns
[34:22] out and we'll put it together next week
[34:24] I don't know what we'll do we may do
[34:25] this again a little more or we'll do
[34:33] something
