========================================

they're coming the kiddies open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart for I want to see you oh Jesus I want to see you so open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I [Music] want to see shining in the light of glory a man wore out your power and love [Music] shiny in the light of war out your power I want to see you amen and amen and amen and amen you want to see him don't you Amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to be gathered together and all even though times are bad and what's going on we can still at this present time together and worship and and always sorry that some has to sit outside and it's little just you know discomfort I guess you called it but I was like I told Wade and gave him a little note our Wednesday and he read it just kind of what I was thinking what would you be doing if if it wasn't for this virus thing unless something really bad would be wrong I'd be a church with you and and that's what we want to be in this that's the point you know of coming together and to be here and have a good time and sorry the inconvenience but that's what I've said what are you gonna do you you know a little bit problems are with it but we will abide until things gets worked out and it'll eventually straighten up enough to to be able to do and whatever but until that time we have to kind of go by that and and just you know make ourselves ready cuz we want to serve God no matter what see and if we can't keep up with the footmen the Bible said what about when the horsemen get here what about when they come in and start making more demands more things you know and all like that least we have to still make a way or find a way to be able to - how services or do something if we have to we'll we'll broadcast right from the house or something will we'll do the best we can do in all to to get it and you think well this is not too bad because it's kind of people are getting used to what's going on now and and you say well it's not too bad but it is pretty bad when you when you can't go where you want to go or you can't go to church can't do that but it's not this church that's what I've tried to tell you this is just the beginning of things because it's it's not into the religious realm this necessarily right now of you know things going on and all like that but yet it is because it's rote controlling and it'll become more and more you'll see the religious room as it begins to unfold and more control will be brought into view that's my my thoughts but if we can't do something now what we're gonna do when that comes you know I mean you know when the time comes for the thing if we can't get along now so you know and that's what I said I don't I don't ask you to our demand you as a passenger to you to do now I just ask you to be what you want to be and if you come to church and all like that and sit outside just do that for the glory of the Lord and let God get to honor and glory out of the whole thing if we can sit inside we said inside we do the best we can do to be able to operate in that way then you know the Lord will take care of all the rest but now I'm like this if we don't put forth an effort this is just me and this is the way I've always been doesn't matter when I think the bad besides this away same now if we don't put forth an effort you know in the times of trouble to be able to move on with the Lord what are we I thought we were you know people of the the Word of God and the Word was telling us what to do not what everybody else tells us so then just think of these things think about it is that we have the time we can do and if they narrow down anymore we do something else we keep moving to whatever we can do and then let that abide and in a you know it'll work out it all come out to the right place all right I know you've done it but make sure you pray for brother al he's still having a lot of problems brother Forney pray for brother Kali and let's pray for all of these brother Roberts brother Dale earth and this sister Mary dougherty and in all of the ones that have what we call major things you know sicknesses and things keep those in mind and just pray that the Lord would bless each one but remember everybody else remember the whole church and just pray that God would bless okay if you like turning your scriptures turn into Luke 17 and we will try to pick up where we were last week and move on and brother Aaron the Lord willing we'll be ministering this coming Wednesday so remember that I know you've already prayed sister Barbara's son they're checking him for the virus and also just remember him he's there in the hospital that's what she called last night about 11:00 there's nothing that you know having problems so remember that okay Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your grace unto us thank you for an opportunity at this time that we can still service have service for you we can come together a little in the convenience but what what is this compared with the early ages in the church and the problems in the heartaches and troubles and the deaths and the sorrows that they went through to try to serve you what little things are we going through what are we playing in Lord in this you know help us to see and to walk in the light of your grace keep us in your growth understanding bless the sick among us and help us to walk in you in Jesus name now we net we said it Wednesday we're not asking you to even to try to come on Wednesdays if you want to come that's fine that's honorable but that's a not service first we're not asking you to do that we're asking you to come to the morning service the evening service on the Sundays and when you're coming up here as Wade was announcing it to make sure you understand where I stand because I was when it wrote the notes on parts of it that you know you if you if you know you're not going to be able you're invited you're chosen to come on Sunday services all right in the insider hour Wednesdays or whatever yeah it's not bad on Wednesday but on Sunday you know if something if something goes wrong we're not you know don't go well how do I get sick well if you get sick we'll pray for the sick but what I'm saying is if you get sick then go to the hospital and nobody won't get to see you and you don't be in service with nobody for a while till they get you cleared up okay being sarcastic okay I'm sarcastic what are you I'm just making it plain to the point that we you know with what we expect don't come for the morning service and then not come back for the evening service let somebody else have that give them that slot you know you're gonna come for one service come for both service you're not gonna come for both service don't come for one let something goes wrong okay that something happens problems and troubles are you clear but see that way you're not taking away from somebody else because you just think about there's a lot of people that like to be setting up here today know both services up here in the building and and if I was one of them I would too and and if I seen you leave out and and not honor the keeping of both services I would I would say hey you know I could have went both of them you know things like that so remember that okay all right just keep in mind all of these things let's read our scripture okay technical difficulty okay versus Luke 17 2002 changed I wasn't gonna do it I had it ready to go and it got changed when I got here so I'll go thisaway and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you all right and he said unto the disciples the days will come no he's talking about and he described the Holy Ghost being in you talking to them right there now look what he's saying the days will come when you shall desire to see the days of the Son of Man and you shall not see it they shall say to you see hear or see they're going on after them or follow them whereas the Lightning that lighteth out of the one part under heaven shine us unto the other part under heaven as so shield also this is coming shall also the Son of Man be in his day now I want to keep that one so rocks in his day the son of man in a day but first must be must he suffer many now going back and what he's going to do and be rejected of the generation and as it it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man they shall eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came calling all the way back through the Bible coming back up right and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build him but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all no even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed all right you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now what I want you to think about because that's what I had on the on the service prior that talking about because I'm still on the quotes just because that have them and they have them back there they don't have to fill up some new ones because we just picked from what we're doing I want to preach really basically the same message but in a little different form now the licen s is my point was that you have son of man son of God son of David okay that's the three sons night okay son of man was the Old Testament right now we're beginning back there the son of man the Old Testament which was what the father right son of man God Himself the Creator the son of man was the word right that created all things and come down and it kept creating kept bringing forth and then it as it came in to the prophets see they were used maybe a little bit to start with but then they said well we don't want the prophets to speak anymore you know I mean we don't want God to speaking of what we want the prophets to speak all right so he designed a way to bring it and brought it through Moses and brought it out into the understanding okay my point then was what son of man son of God son of David son of man was father prophets creator son of God baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth alright son of David he is in the millennial reign to the Jews alright now so we covered that those Old Testaments prophets they said thus saith the Lord because that was the father speaking through them that was God Himself with I used that word father and into the basis of where you'll keep it in mind because I'm trying to click that little spot in the human brain that makes it remember a few little things all right and that one thing is that that word was the Creator God all right and that was the son of man all right because what did it what is it it is the rising of the Sun doesn't want to do where brother Adam said you know that heart is or who is this on a man he said in the beginning was the word Word was with God and the Word was God all right but then he went on to say and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right now so pick up the point now son of man was the creator god the great eternal the kingdom of the what we would call the father's kingdom are the time back there under the Old Testament that he would be dealing with the father in the basis of doing he wouldn't be dealing with the son because nobody didn't get to baptism when the Holy Ghost back there he wouldn't be dealing with son of David so the Old Testament was dealing basically with son of man all right son of man God Himself speaking through those men using the prophets to say thus saith the Lord all right you know bringing it to that basis to work that it was God speaking through the prophets and that would be his kingdom that he was dwelling therein was the word to make flesh all right now all right take that point now and keep what I'm saying and then we'll go back and reread some of the quotes where that you'll see it tie together the the the Jehovah the Old Testament was that Jehovah God the Creator God the the I am that created all things but it was the word that done the creating so keep that in mind and then you won't have any problems when you'll read where the Prophet said and even Scofield brings it out that that the Sun is what was the Creator see he could he could read those things and see it and see what was happening back there alright it kept creating kept coming through and and the prophets would say thus saith the Lord John and it would come through and dwelt all the way through the Old Testament as son of man all right then it came that the Son of man came into human flesh that very word that very father that very God Himself was coming down to dwell in human flesh alright now bringing forth the child bringing forth the child that would come forth later but the Creator that would create a body to come and live in all right and he would bring that down and bring it to her there stood on earth then John 1:1 in the beginning was the word Word was with God the Word was God then verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us what word was made flesh the great eternal Jehovah God himself see not another person but the very Jehovah God himself he now comes down into human flesh now I watched my point as we try to hold it see those prophets they were ice on a van but decent of man would speak through them and they'd say thus saith the Lord alright see and then being a son of man then that would mean that God was dwelling in flesh okay back to the Old Testament he was dwelling in the flesh of those prophets until he could come down enough to remember remember we're covered till when he come to Moses it comes into a greater portion of things because Moses didn't say thus saith the Lord a lot of times he got to the basis of just saying it in in things because that would be speaking of what was coming to be made manifest all right showing that the son of man would come into flesh the son of man would come into human flesh all right the Lord Jesus Christ was the son of man Moses was just a son of man but the Lord Jesus was the son of man stepping forth in human flesh all right now watch my point now see then that son of man would be dealing with the Word made flesh I want you to get that into your mind and drive this little cat down because that's what I've always preached and what I've always believed now that it's not one person it can't be the son of man can't be one person no more that he ended it in the time of the Lord Jesus Christ to be the one person all right from then on it would be into a multiple form or a group or a bride or a church there have been that I've been talking about all right see then it would be to the basis that something was transpiring more in the coming forth of the Lord Jesus than maybe what we think about because dar was the word itself made flesh in the human body the word made a flesh to step into that was fine all right by creating the word itself see then his body would be a human element okay now listen one saying show us what he was going to do there whatever what he done there he's going to do in the entire bride I've never preached that nobody no one man can't be what I'm talking about the Lord's he Christ he is yes God himself is that but not no human elements isn't nothing but as a body of Jesus Christ we're in the days of the manifestation now we can cover all of it son of man son of God son today that we've been through it up and down but we're in the day of the full manifestation of the Word of God the Son of Man Jesus Christ dwelling in his church he said what that's too strong now it ain't strong enough they think about what you're talking what you're what I've been trying to get you to see see the son of man was the Word made flesh right the prophets would stand out and say thus saith the LORD until it was so much so close to him until they'd how to veil Moses face and all kind of things would have to be for those people and they would speak the Word of God but one day that God stepped on earth all right now where did he step he stepped into human flesh right so he'd become John one in the beginning was the word Word was with God and the Word was God taking to all of the Old Testament all of the Creator all of the things of the Old Testament about Jehovah and being showing the father himself the Creator standing forth and bringing the word which was the son to bring the word all right now in doing that then his his plan and purpose was to come and live in human flesh all right now listen what I'm talking about you know yourself that most of the time you think about God coming to live in human flesh was that he came down to release the life that was in the flesh that's well good and that's okay well and good call this through he did come down to offer up that flesh but had he not come in flesh he couldn't come forth to do the redemptive right there have been no redemption so you got to take everything and put it under son of man because really son of man in the whole Bible ties together everything thing all right and that was what I was trying to get across her last week was to make sure you see that all of those prophets were God in another form but yet not the D son of man because it would not dwell in just one but they were God in another form Moses because that's what Jesus said he said you call them gods that the word come to and he said that is right that is right those prophets were so close to God until God was in that prophet living and and speaking forth but he was in a human element that had a beginning and and sin had entered the picture and etc so that couldn't be used to do that part see there was no way you or I could do anything to save each other one couldn't die for the other do any good now but Jesus Christ could come live on earth become now listen what I'm saying become the Word made flesh and then he could give his life to release that that was within him okay released that that was within him then to get us salvation for the Soul but you still got a problem with the body see one day you're going to realize what I'm talking about I'm done by the rapture and and and resurrection and they down here in low enough turns until if you're not careful you'll miss what I'm saying see your resurrection is inside of you your rapture is inside of you it is that new birth it is that baptism of the Holy Ghost all right but we've got to get some way to bring it back to flesh and I know I've tried to preach this for years and people you know they ain't saying they don't understand I'm just saying it's been a hard thing to try to preach that you can't go from Son of Man the Son of God the Son of David you can't go that way see the Prophet went from Son of Man the Son of God down through the ages then in the last part of the life stage he comes back to Son of Man and then he says now we can go to son of David see if you don't come back to that son of man in this day just prior to the change there's not going to be ashamed that's what I'm trying to get you to see I'm trying to get you to see the very key of all of the understanding of the Bible lays in the fact to be able to understand the Son of Man and what's transpiring what's taking place wasn't what's being done and see there through the Old Testament those prophets would say to us saith the Lord and it would even come up to Moses until he'd move in closer than the other prophets and he would actually speak and then even like day vigilant see 108 they pierced my hands and my feet and time where David would actually so come and get so involved in what he was doing till it he would be talking like himself you remember and that's what the man asked under Oh in the book of Acts or something is this man talking about himself or another they because there was those men that were so used until they would be speaking of what would happen but yet still no matter how what they were they couldn't do anything to redeem the man so here God had to come into human flesh huh he couldn't have stepped out on earth and regained the man he had to come in human flesh to be able to number one release that soul that being part of him that could come back on you and I in the new birth all right but he had to redeem that body what if he had not to redeemed his own body he said you mean his guardian yeah his body was a creation in flames the creation got a beginning is you've got an ending to it alright see are you following me see then the son of man when he stepped on earth then he truly was verse 14 of John and the word was made flesh not to just say the word made of flesh the word itself was made flesh and dwelt among us you say are you expecting that to be in the end time yes but never to be in one person well can't happen in one person what I've preached for 40 some years I see it right now some but it can't be in one person I don't care who it is you me or who do you think it is it can't be done in one person the bride herself becomes the fullness of the Godhead bodily the Prophet said how is that to happen that's why I've always tried to preach it to you who the Son of Man really is Jesus was the flesh land that God inhabited to live on earth right but yet that flesh had to do a redemptive we wasn't ten folks to God in spirit no we're kinfolks to God by the redemptive power of the blessings that he redeemed us through the fact of giving his life yes coming to live in you and I to redeem us but he went right on and brother Brown said he lay claim go to future home city laid claim right dark write their own Calvary he lay claim to our bodies but he had to wait awhile and then it would have to be come back in the end time to come back to the son of man listen to what I'm trying to say and get it rightly to understand if there is no son of man in the end time there is no redemptive power for the change of the body so we're going to keep going by the grave until somebody realized what's taking place you say yeah but you you're making it tortoise I'm making it the worse a whole group of people never to one individual but a random I gave you the quotes on a will read them in a minute where he said a universal Church a universal mean all over the whole world and four brings it down as to being the bride you mean that we're gonna have something to do with the redemption yes see but brother branham coming to bring the message is not the fullness of the son of man I said it the way I meant it he's not the fullness he's part of it he's part of the body of Christ but he's not the fullness of it but neither I mean you it takes all of us together not just one person or one little group of Lula i'ts no it takes a bride around the world Jesus Christ was the flesh man that God came himself God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself God came down into human flesh making that man the son of man not a son of man not just to be a prophet even though he was a prophet he was the greatest of all prophets but he was the king of the prophets see if you can look back and see those prophets could be called as Jesus said him the cinammon ago jesus said you called the prophets God he said one of you condemned me to say that I'm a son of God see they knew when he said that he was son of God that son of God would God in human flesh they were smarter than your thing they knew what he was saying they didn't kill him for him making little statements they killed him when he was making the statements that they knew what he was talking about he was telling them he was God in human flesh and that's who that was God in human flesh what is the bride to be in the last days you'll see what I've always tried to preach the bride is to be God in human flesh that's all I've tried to get you to see about us and what we are 47 years preaching it that away to believe it about the son of man they see Jesus was God in human flesh are a flesh man the God revealing himself to mankind in mankind or in flesh that's what Jesus was doing he was revealing God in flesh see that's what I said about them they wasn't dummies they knew what he was saying they knew when he said that I'm the son of God they knew better than to think about a Trinity they wouldn't even though when he was saying I'm the son of God they knew he was saying that he was God in human flesh because today what is the child of God you realize by that Newberg that you have you're a child of God your God made manifest in another form called a bride that's all I've ever tried to preach all I've ever tried to get us to see if we can just see what the Bible is saying about us and see son of God is spirit God right son of David is God over the earth and the ruler of humanities and everything you know he's in full control into that son of David sure he's connected to the Jews and they'll be into that part sit on the throne and they'll be there right but he's the son of man if he couldn't come back I said if he couldn't come back code I believe he's come back now I'll get to that in a minute I don't believe brother Branham is God no way but there's one thing about it he's so close to it because if it took a veil over Moses's face for them to be able to stand in his presence no wonder the people couldn't understand brother Branham no wonder they made him God no wonder they tried to worship him and all of the things why because it was no close so close to being God in human flesh bring him back to Ehsan a man and keep him in that situation and you bring back now listen here on won't get to point that it took me 40 years to try to preach think the bride will be the son of man but you put her in flesh and stand without of him she's a son of man he's the son of mine ain't doing away with him don't-don't-don't never think that I'm trying to do away with him put it all over into her uh-huh no no it's not all into her you got to keep him here he's the one but he is the son of man but when he comes now he's in the bride form in this dispensational part right now he's in bride form Church ages made away right son of man made a way for son of God to come into church aid he gave his life he relinquished the life out of his human flesh and the flesh went to the grave and had to be redeemed not because it was sinful no well cause it was a creation it had a beginning all right son of man made way for son of God son of God makes wafers not a man because son of God is to return back to the original word right that's why the Prophet had to come that's why Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 all of those had to follow back it had to be a prophet coming this day do you see this you go that away you go that away you miss it either way brother Branham was not God but he was as close as it'll ever be as far as human elements because God was using him all right the son of man was using a son of man in our day I never made brother Branham the son of man I've always talked out the testicle incorrect you can't make right around them at least on a man no but the son of man come through that flesh to till actually it what I told you there Sunday if you've listening if you'll go back and listen when you hear me say it keep this in the correct line with Moses and you can look at mo and see that Moses was God to the people the Bible says that says you'll be God error be your prophet that's why when Moses would come up he'd said Aaron Aaron would say just say if the Lord go down the rod this thing happen well cuz there and hate he had to have a prophet he had to have a voice because that was what they wanted was somebody to speak he knew that would come forth in the time so they were they were doing him but get what I'm saying then yeah but Moses himself was so close into that position until brother Brown said it he said I couldn't understand how Moses could tell God a better way of doing that he said until I see it was Christ in Moses who was that in standing there on the earth God in human flesh but his name was Moses why because he was in a natural flesh as long as you keep that natural flesh don't you worry about it don't let that natural flesh ever ride up too much look it won't work all right but listen let's not of man all right he's God in human flesh in Jesus Christ the prophets were a son of man which was being God using them but inside of them was not the dwelling of the Holy Spirit as a new birth right you see why we've spent so much time over the years trying to get you to understand that be careful with that how you carry it let's see but it's so close till Moses could actually stand there and speak or write the Bible right yet he was not the God of the Bible he couldn't die for your sins me so you came you always got to keep him like Son of Man but when you come to the finality of this day it can't be just a son of man if you can get God back in human flesh you've got the son of man and I'm talking about God in your flesh and my flesh I'm talking about going further than just this point of saying we're born again at faith I'm talking about statue of a perfect man going on out adoptions all of the things is bringing it into reality that's a bride not just three quarters of it and see I'm not putting nothing out because if you understand what I'm saying listen this is well touted and always hot you can't just make it to bride in the end time that bride all the way back back from the book of Acts back from the first church age that's the bride to me that's the one of standing in Revelations one Girt about the paps with a golden girl that's that one back there it takes all of the bride across in every church age I'm not saying that one individual at one church age or one thing can be no I've never taught it that way you may have thought it but it's not being because it's got to be the fullness of the Godhead bodily so you can't make the life stage listen you can't make the life stage the fullness of the Godhead bodily without bringing it through seven Church ages then you can talk about fullness of the Godhead bodily when you put all the church ages together and bring out all of them in what they're supposed to be bringing we get down through those ages there was not any of those that were dealing with the the redemption of the body the great Apostle Paul was a great of all but yet he still had questions and thoughts he didn't he could talk about changes he could talk about those things but he couldn't bring it into manifestation right he knew it was the future thing he knew what he was saying would come in the future now we're here see now the bride realizing who she is Luther name might not understood who they were but they were part of the body of Christ and I am in no way talking about a son of man that's being in the seventh Church a juror or a bride age or some kind of something like that I've never taught nothing like that it takes all of the entire bride down through seven Church ages to come out and then you got the bride age that comes into manifestation the bride age that comes into manifestation is when that man stands out in what is it Leviticus 25 we're talking about the have a house it stated Leviticus 25 because it covers right down under were the sounding of the trumpet and all the tents tents verse and coming down to the complete plan of redemption the fifty or through the 49 that there's a there's a church age messenger in this forty ninth we had a man in this message I mean a man in this day that was not the messenger to the lady or CEO he said I'm not said you'll make me a lady Oh seeing you say yeah but he was preaching to them back there now his message he had to restore he had to restore all of those things before his message could be brought his message begun in the seals because that was the message Moses brought to the people that wrote the five books from are you following me you getting the point see you got to get something to worry that can deal with flesh the Lord Jesus Christ was God made manifest in human flesh called the son of man that's what he said who the man say i the son of man am my brother Ron said he never declared himself to be son of God said he always would declare himself to be Son of Man because that was what it would be to work would come forth well wouldn't it come forth in the end time what's your problem with with coming forth in the end time to see that God brought us a profit and that profit was so close he was just like Moses he was so close until you'd have to veil his face because he didn't you'd start worshiping the messenger instead of the message I believe the messenger and the message is one I don't believe the messenger by itself is one you bring the message and you get it into reality listen the son of man was in the Old Testament and would be the eternal God appearing in the prophets to bring forth the word alright Moses did not now listen to the point and you'll see why that you can't put the fullness all in one thing even though Moses wrote five books he could not bring it forth into manifestation all right and writing the five books they you would be leaving out the word coming in flesh because you'd be dealing with that looking at that trying to make that two word flesh you know Moses don't do that come on down Moses just spoke of the coming of the Son of Man the Lord Jesus Christ and he spoke of the coming of the bride not see those prophets were the flesh yes they were the flesh that God would use and God could use brother Branham in such a mighty way until it would be hard to tell the difference between him and and the God that was doing I agree with that I mean I I see people I don't make that garden to be there but I see people that hold her confidence so much in to brother branham and thinking he's gone but you can't do that what you're making part of the body of Christ cuz that's what he is then you can start talking about the Son of Man because this one Noah the bride is not complete let's see let me see let me state it in my way now God is not completely not you understanding the run said God is not complete without you alright so there's something that's got to be into me and you alright do you realize then that brother Browns not complete without you but now let me say it again you're not complete without him you know one come by we're not complete without brother Branham he's the one that brought the message it's putting it into the order of trying to show that it's not God that we're looking at it's God in a man it's a flesh that was yielded so unto the God could come and live in that flesh I believe that will happen again onto a bride of Jesus Christ maybe for a short period right maybe it'll be evil like brother Brian said said give me a church full of the Holy Ghost and God will do in one year what theologians tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing it now see you realize you ever think about what you're facing right now now listen for a minute I'm not gonna try to preach nothing out of the word to try to get it but I'm trying to get you to see something you realize right now what's taking place the churches are not attacking the baptism when the Holy Ghost mm-hmm these demons are not attacking the baptism when the hell ago they know better that virus I can't pronounce the word for it so I called it virus but that virus is attacking you were flesh come on it's a contact disease right it's got to house something even if it's sneezing - mucus or something coming out and and you and you standing beside of somebody and they sneeze and you get your disease it's still a fleshly disease isn't that odd getting it odd - these diseases that acting right when the bride is being taught that what out and I'm saying it do what you want - I've been teaching this 40 years so don't worried about you thinking I'm on get exalted cuz I ain't concerned about that but I am saying one thing I have taught this 40 years over over over over to get us ready and now here we are facing a disease that is attacking the flesh why because the bride is beginning to see who she really is that she's God in human flesh then whatever we've got God give it to us it is he that have made us not we ourselves do you realize what I'm talking about you realize what I've been trying to say for all of these years but never been invited to do so anywhere to come and preach yet maybe one message opportunity and then I'm gone I can't do it because I'll try to preach it a little bit of something and the first thing you know that I'm not invited no more and that's no problem I understand I stand one thing for sure if God had to reveal to me the Son of Man the bride being the son of man and putting it in the correct way that not to be a son of I mean to be a son of man that the son of man would be living in but would be the Word made flesh and that's what I taught in 1969 and I believed that I've not been upsetting hard about anybody that don't want to believe it because if a card came and they don't reveal it to you you can't see it you can't see it unless God reveals it right now his honest this can be even after he reveals it sometimes it gets pretty rough because you're trying to look at too much flesh and then you wind up trying to whoop the flesh in the line it's not whooping the flesh in the line if the word that will come to redeem the flesh the Holy Ghost is supposed to put the word in flesh in line the body right that we present our bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable under God see that's what we've got to do with what he's done for us knowing that we're standing here facing all of these things knowing that we're hearing the endtime with all of these things happening and I'm not scaring nobody that it ain't gonna scare you anyway I've never tried to scare anybody with what I thought you know what I taught I love this not what I believe I've always believed that the bride a complete bride not a singlet not meaning a few or Allu lights or something some group know it's all over the whole world and it's all back down through seven churches ages all the way back it takes all of them to come forth and be the son of man didn't they realize what was taking place the Martin Luther you think about him that is he he he went out there with that knee and he he was a good man he was he was a you know as we called it converted under the times of the days and the things within God spoke to him and said to just shall live by faith and he wrote right beside of it they say alone the just shall live by faith alone ain't gonna live by nothing else he didn't want to come out of the Catholic Church I got his own ridings at home he wanted to convert to church he was doing everything he could to try to convert to church he didn't do what didn't try to do away with the communions and the things they were doing back there he wanted them to be correct he wanted all that to be but when he realized that they were not acting what he was a saying they were going out and burning down buildings and saying Luther told us to do this he didn't do that he was trying to get him converted that's right that's what I say all right Jesus was the Word made flesh a man walking on the earth in human flesh all right now take that entire Jesus Christ because each age is a part of Jesus Christ each individual is a part of Jesus Christ you know born-again believers and put all that together and what do you got in the last days the son of man the word my flesh how much did the Prophet speak on the word being my flesh how much did he speak about how the word the bride had to become the word I asked you to even discern any type just go home pick out a tape stick it in and you'll hear him saying something about what I'm talking about the redemptions the salvations the things because that's what he's always talked listen see the son of man was in the Old Testament right through those prophets and times Jehovah God using the prophets to do the things even using them to create as Moses then he appears in human flesh walking on the shores of Galilee right then in it odd the to Bible says they without us should not be made perfect they without us that's what I've drove that driving I believe that Luther was standing here today he'd say that's what I was talking about when I preach the just shall live by faith that's exactly what I was talking about Oh God living in human flesh in a people he rejoiced with the Holy Ghost that was within him but waiting the redemption of the body that's what all has done but you don't catch it let me say it one more time then it's in it so odd that in the Old Testament the son of man God Himself was finally produced no and listen what did the Prophet say he said the prophets built the body body body that's flesh all right the prophets built the body that walked on the shores of Galilee we call Jesus because they were the word and he was the word all right and he walks on the shores of Galilee as God in human flesh because that's what happened I agree with the River Jordan if they'll get it in the right order brother branham said it listen a lot of the times as I but you get it in the right order right because if you don't you get it all out all messed up he stood there on the River Jordan and the Holy Ghost came on him under-19 came upon the Lord Jesus Christ the Brethren said made him the fullness of the Godhead bodily not if he wasn't God before the end he was Almighty God or he couldn't come to that place he was already the word but that anointing that came on him they could not touch that body they couldn't kill him until it was done and finished - what that man had to complete then they could kill him what when their mourning left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he went on the Calvary would you want all alike I like the fact the reason that up there in the garden it left him but it's to come in the bride and the end time and then to show that she doesn't it were brother Branham said the anointing to the temple in the Millennium is the bride of Jesus Christ he said the anointing is up on that people that rods back we were sitting there life's not listening then he said you know we talk about the the bride we talk about this she said you're a bride dis for one day I said then you become his wife that covers maturity so the Book of Revelations covers what and his wife has made herself ready revelations not to but it turns right around in a verse or two out of them and talks about the bride why because it is the bride the bride is that one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks lock under the front of them you're looking at the bride seeing it odd that we're coming down to the message that deals exactly with the redemption because we're coming back to the possibility and showing that in the Old Testament it took all the Old Testament through all of the prophets that thus saith the Lord's all of the things and Moses and all of the different things getting it ready to wear that it could come forth and as it would come forth it would be a man walk up on the shores of Galilee as a human being that would give his life not to just release the Holy Ghost to come back because that would not be the full redemption of the person that would redeem the soul but you've got to have the body redeemed he was my brother in human flesh he was not kinfolks to me until he come into human flesh right well you got to keep the story running correct then when you get the story running correct you'll see all the way through the Bible that's coming forth with a beautiful picture yes that it took all of that Old Testament prophets to bring forth one man which was the Lord Jesus Christ and then he would have to give his life to release the holy ghost it was in him yes but he'd have to give his life a human flesh ransom that our bodies could be redeemed future future home our soul is redeemed but said we're waiting the redemption of the body isn't it odd that the end time then is to have a mystery and that's what I read to you last week prophet said it's a message a mystery in that something that all of these things could be put together the word that you could see what's going on listen read real fast and oh no I don't ask him to pull him up but I ran him on the message called the trial in these last days as son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people same message when the Son of man shall be revealed son of man being revealed not son of God in the church age he's put out of that and he son of man revealing himself the word is becoming flesh among us church we would see Jesus Jesus in you tonight until God manifests himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known worthy to be made known in this day in human flesh your flesh there's your Redemption see God down here in his church making himself again the word the Son of man being revealed in the last days the son of man back in his church the mighty God unveil back in the church again reveal in human beings not Son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days what about it you remember these from last week the faithful Abraham then the Holy Spirit wasn't only in one person it's in the entire Church Universal doing the same works that Jesus did hallelujah I challenged the world to believe that and you'll see a revival break through this country see divine healings and things all right crisis the mystery of God revealed present himself in fullness of the Godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people excuse me the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by wine accepting what Eve turned down and Adam Adam coming back in the anointing of the word that he said my word is he anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept unveiling of God he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he then was the son of God God is the spirit he was the Holy Spirit son of God and he lived through the church ages as son of God now in the Millennium he'll be son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David he is the son of David now and remember between the Son of God in the lady of Sein age they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again as son of man the Prophet fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures tied together tie perfectly together son of man son of God son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form in morphe he just changes it in the great drama - to him he's acting it out it is arising in her son who is this son of man in the beginning was the word words with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if that if all the teaching that we have the confirmation of the Word of God by Word of God by signs by wonders we see today that in the book of like glucans in the 1730 and all the scriptures that that the word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of God is alive again if you see then the Prophet brought his message and look what happened we say all God was good shepherd was in his in his son Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily all of God was poured out in Christ all that God was was in Christ and all that Christ is he poured out on the church but you keep refusing it so you don't believe it now can't be a nice what come on the Patmos vision God was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now worst worst God to be revealed in his church with his people in us the same spirit the same works the same manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering gentleness patience peace mercy all that was in Christ is in the church remember keep this in mind all that God was he poured into Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily all that Christ was he poured into the church God above us so if he's a fullness we've got everybody what does it make us okay God's only provided place of worship no living among you that brings the entire fullness of the Godhead bodily among you no denominational ideas no doctrines and things of our own couldn't do it in Luther's they couldn't do it in Pentecostal Wesley but in the light in the day when the Son of Man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people the mighty God unveiled before us it was God in Christ God in a man the fullness of the Godhead bodily in a man God in a man now it's God in men the fullness of God in the Godhead bodily in his entire church manifested himself fulfilling his word ok come on then lean not you your own understanding God isn't complete without you he isn't complete without you so if he's not complete without us why can't we believe we're part of him ok the message what was the Holy Ghost given for and Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily all that Jehovah was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church not into one individual but into the entire body see that would cover all the way down through the church ages all the way through fullness of the Godhead bodily it was poured out on the church okay let me stop on that no not continue that point because we'll pick it up maybe in the next message I don't know but I want to stop right there because I don't want to get your thoughts into too much I want you to think about one simple thing and we'll go back through it the great eternal God wanted to reveal himself to mankind so he created man he made him a human being he put him in the garden give him complete control leadership and everything whatever Adam would say or do God accepted it that was the way it would be wind blow prophets save wind ceased didn't take place because Adam would ask you well yet sin entered the picture now look at the point of what I've always tried to get you see always put something down this way and then put it down this way what if Adam and Eve had not have sinned well that would have been great we would just come for remember the tree of life was in the garden but also remember the tree of knowledge of good and evil was there but remember the tree of life was in the garden what about Adam and Eve what if they did this to come to the point of understanding enough to go to that tree now we've taught it and we believe it or at least I've tried to say it Adam God breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul blasphemous names okay so then Eve would have had to been part of Adam in theophany thigh so that since she was been eternal in her soul when she was created okay but they wouldn't eternal in their flesh what the tree was there they could have went to that tree but Satan before they got to the tree he entered the picture and perverted their minds and her thinking all right because they'd have made it to that tree the Bible says let's you know let's put them for lest they partake of the tree and they would become as God's knowing good and evil I said it couldn't happen so then God knew the plan but he what did he do he kept Adam and Eve pulled it away and sin had entered the picture brother branham masterpiece he said God didn't quit he said he just started over he had a masterpiece in the family of Adam and Eve in the garden he said sin entered the picture and he said he just backed out he never killed him told him away done everything he just started building another masterpiece you come forth then you got a jump see because you're gonna be able to get the two together there's Wade's in it now so hold on to what he's doing you got a jump to Abraham but remember that Abraham is what Moses was riding before then but don't worry about that just get to Abraham right because Abraham was showing the complete plan of redemption to the change of the body right the full redemption even turning back to a young man and a young woman the full plan of redemption was shown through there all right but nobody couldn't understand it it couldn't be followed the prophets was doing the best they could do so you have then a couple of thousand years that the prophets would come forth and God would speak through them and they would come out and they'd say thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord this is to you now this is thus saith the Lord and it was God speaking to to mankind through mankind and bringing it forth all right but see then one day those prophets kept coming and as they were coming east prophets message fit perfectly into the puzzle until it brought forth a body or a stature if you want to call it you know and John the Baptist coming to be the last one to introduce the head alright he didn't have no thus saith the Lord John did have thus said the Lord he had the word of the Lord because you'll find that he's a tea stone standing between the old and the new this is exactly the way the Lord Jesus stands in a greater way between the old and then he the Moses I mean John stood there because he introduced behold the lamb of God he didn't come out the staff the Lord don't know huh he come out speaking that word showing what it was to wind up all right the Lord Jesus Christ walked forth on her God in human flesh spends 30 years of his life 33 trying to preach a plan of redemption even covering how the sower of the seed is the son of man that's the son of man he never spoke of son of God now he did he spoke of him into our brother branham will say that he'll say says he wouldn't he never referred to himself as son of God then either while you'll hear me said now now somebody say it now that you get it he said now somebody said that Jesus never called herself son of God he said yes he did cuz that's who he was when he you think then he forgot or what happened he was the one that said that he never used son of God he wasn't doing it he was trying to put it in the correct order you get it all day this one puts it in order for this and I all right be here is the Lord Jesus Christ God in human flesh the son of man what about a D son of man stand there and say he said the Son of man has power to forgive sins ain't it kind of odd brother Branham come forward in the last days trying to get us to see the two bride of Jesus Christ standing under the word can forgive sin not in the wrong way now but in the right way you come with a word and it'll work I'm just getting the point see then when he died he released that holy spirit that would come back and live in the bride and down through 7 Church ages you had Son of God manifesting himself through mighty marvelous things that are that was transpiring down through those ages and times coming out into the life days and all at once as I said brother Brown says here he is not a man son of God some David he said but just at the ending of song God before you can go to the Millennium cities comes back for a moment that's none of man then you hear brother Branham coming forth and what was he doing thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord all the way from the beginning in his ministry right cuz that was God speaking through him but then today come he says why cry speak he told the Prophet said stop crying and speak it and go on why because he had put in his hands the ability to speak the word what did he speak about you and me redemption for you and me what did it finish up being the prophet of God brought his message but he had to go off the scene why because they was making him the son of man and that was incorrect though then you start dealing with this word the seals the opening of the word the prophets message and you see that that's bringing the bride then into view she comes back she comes into view the bride and she will be God manifest in human flesh that is the son of my brother Branham was a part of that because he was part of the body of Christ yet he was a church he's a messenger like I said in our the other day think about all the things he was a prophet he was a church agent messenger he was a prophet spoke of in the Bible to come forth now look how for Luke 17 there you know and here he comes and he speaks these things but he has to go off the same like John the Baptist said I must decrease it he might increase your profit brought those same things it had to go off of the scene to where the bride would begin to realize who she is what about it the redemption of these bodies is now possible because we have had the message of redemption her body soul and spirit to be redeemed come on musicians what about it the son of man the bride of Jesus Christ to be the son of man but that's the brother man let's just make him a little bit too much out of the bride why it's what he said he chose his wife he said it all in motion and spoke of it spoken word regional seed what what did he coming through there oh no and he said something about that said you get that Brut nuber said it takes you back like he wasn't beginning and he's positive you hear in the thigh he paused and he said something like what that was great I've never seen that before they take a right back to where we're going now to finish it up yours all the demons striking the body trying its best to keep the bride from reaching it see doc I can stand here and say for the way that I believe it then them demons out there now are fighting the word that has been broke has been brought first he does it then he reveals it and then he makes it manifest all right so he's revealed it he's doing it and he's showing us the redemption of the body these diseases has no right to be on you and I we can we can turn it away we can cast it off we can but just remember these bodies are so important to us because that is his wife not the wrong ideas new thoughts and minds but that is this wife let's tan oh my god [Music] oh oh sorry out there for being a little bit late and make you push to go eat but go ahead and run you get back [Music] Vince of who is the bride she's him might manifest [Music] for its enterprise [Music] in the presser loving [Music] Oh doing that ride home it's the Word of God is the brain [Music] and you're supposed a bad Oh father we just thank you for today and we ask you to what we said would be sufficient for the time you know that our mind was twisted this morning to go in another way but we we changed our thoughts Lord from what you said to doing and we believe that the way it's supposed to be it's not then you forgive us and just help us we'll get back to it and speak a lot more about you we love you and we thank you bless everybody dismiss us and for a little bit as we go eat and bring us back together to weight administering this even at one o'clock and have your way Lord let your grace be sufficient in Jesus name Amen you're dismissed
