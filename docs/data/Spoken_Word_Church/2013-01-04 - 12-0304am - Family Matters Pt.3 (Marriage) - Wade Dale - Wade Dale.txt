I hope you enjoyed last Sunday I enjoyed it myself um if you look online you'll see brother Joe give he's really doing a good job he's putting all even the notes in between that I'm using he's putting on the internet so if you want to copy a thorough copy just go online and you will um you'll have them there there for you right but uh I wanted to say one thing I'm I appreciate what brother Clark said Wednesday night on the kind of daughter and doctor because that's exactly what we're doing me man you can have your Doctrine right and not be in the right spirit and be wrong right right amen but if you got the right Spirit you'll come to the right Doctrine amen but you have the right Doctrine and be lost and on your way to hell right but without conduct order and Doctrine that's the way this message was put out to us I Believe by the prophet our conduct the order of that conduct and then the doctrine so let's let's get the let's get to the light brother around and said last week let's get the Primal things what the primary things the ABCs of god let's get them in order first so let's um let's go to First Peter 3 unless so let's bow our heads before we get finished before we get started the heavenly father we pray Lord today that you'll just be with us not be Lord away from us as a onlooker but Lord be an active participant in the service not not just up here Lord be an active participant back in the congregation Lord with even from the children right up to the adults Lord that you would help them Lord to focus on the things that we need to do to to live a better Christian Life Lord and not be a not be a hindrance to the world father because in this end time you put the best on the best time you put the best people you put the best message you put the greatest anointing ever been is right here lord it's in the people father and we're now looking towards you Lord the author and finisher of our faith to to come down and and vindicate and and help us with this message Lord that you wouldn't mind us all closer together as as husband and wife and his family Lord in our struggles to to Walk Through This World Lord we we know you you are in every present help in the time of trouble but you also give us five senses and you gave us a second round to to contact also the world with our feelings and emotions and Lord we need to keep all those in order for you our conduct our order Lord needs to be together before even we talk about our Doctrine Lord we pray Lord that you'll just be with people that are sick Lord that are not here Lord the ones that are in the sanctuary today that are not feeling well Lord you sent your word and healed the people so he goes forth Lord today that they'll be healed during the quickening power of this word Lord will take over lord and just heal us Lord give us strength raise us up for your honor and glory Lord bless each one bless the missionaries on the foreign field that should give them strength Lord as they do their their job Lord overseas and we pray for them Lord that they that you'll come down and give them fruit for their labor that they'll not that they'll not feel Lord unwanted but Lord we pray that you just be with them probably give a strength bless this day you've already blessed your word Lord now blessed to our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen all right I'm going to read it out of the dog like and you read it off of the King James version Enlightenment or let wives be subject to their own husbands so that if some are disobedient to the word they may without a word be gained through the conduct of their wives yeah yeah conduct of their wives somebody can be converted yeah having seen your conduct chaste with fear whose decoration let it not be that external one of braiding the hair and putting on a gold chains or wearing of apparel but decorate the hidden land of the heart with what is incorruptible what is Incorruptible a Meek and quiet Spirit right which is very precious in the sight of God for this formerly also those holy women who hoped in God adorned themselves being subject to their own husband as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose children you are become doing good and not fearing any Terror and like man or husbands dwell according to knowledge with the female as the weaker vessel storing honor as being also joint heirs right of the gracious gift of life in order that your prayers may not be hindered amen the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated and remember the theme part of this is that your prayers be not hindered amen our conduct toward our wives our conduct toward our husband can hinder our prayers is that right right that's true whether you believe it or not it's a Bible the Bible said it we believe it right so there it is it's the truth our prayers could be hindered by our very conduct of our everyday life amen right you know I um our preaching you know does does good but do you know our actions speak louder than any words that we that we utter so we think that uh that there's something to that that if we try to witness to somebody and and something stands in the way of us witnessing to them how good a witness are we right right if something we do right if the conduct that we do hinders somebody from being saved you know whose problem that is right amen do you know the Bible even says if you cause your wife to commit adultery right that she's not guilty you are you're guilty of making her commit advice pretty strong but why because of the double Covenant right man's the hand of the house period period right there's no co-equal right now right there was in the garden Adam and Eve I pulled up some uh a little thing on byproduct because I didn't cover it my wife was writing a couple of things down so this is kind of comical but I'll use it you know I always say you know we always say not to live a hound dog life unless one of brother Clark's favorite saying is you know if we leave a hound dog life then we ought not be Christians well leaving the hound dog life you know what a hound dog does Hound Dog's always hunting for something and that's what it is that's what I Hound all up you always hunt for something not settled let them go and then run out all over the woods and make a lot of noise yeah sometimes they find something yeah look at the byproduct he was a byproduct of Adam by product now listen to this my product is a secondary product derived from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction it is not the primary product or service being produced right listen to this this is need a byproduct can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste right but look at some of the examples molasses is good right it's only sugar so molasses is a byproduct of sugar it's not a lesser product it's molasses but it's defined or refined from sugar asphalt is not lower form than crude oil it's just a byproduct right of the process mineral from refried and crude oil to produce gasoline yeah and of course we get salt from desalinization right so salt is not a salt is not a is not a lower form of the salt that's in the sea and what it's just something happened to do what separate it yeah so that it can be what used right all right I see a byproduct can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste that's why my brother rounds in a woman can be what the greatest thing that a man can have besides salvation or she can be what water in your blood right so she can be both and Men You're not far from that right you can be useful or you can be waste right but Eve being a byproduct of Adam she was not a lesser form than Adam this is before the fall in the beginning when we were talking about this kind of review a little bit about them being co-equal they became co-equal when Eve come out of Adam right didn't make her a less reform she was just a byproduct something else to be used in the refining of Adam everything in the refining of Adam Eve came right not unless reform right but to enhance Adam Eve came out Amen to enhance sugar molasses comes out yeah you see what I'm saying about a byproduct so a byproduct is not dog meat like most people in the message preach that that man was you know like that he said man was ribeye steak and and woman was was some kind of tribe or something or oxtail no no I haven't even co-equal right I read you there in verse 7 and Peter he doesn't say it in the in the King James version but it does in the in the emphatic dying lot it tells you that they're we're going back to being joint heirs amen all right join air but what happened was from the fall in the Garden of Eden it brought forth a double Covenant right right all right now that double Covenant was because number one remember Adam began to be fearful remember it says in there in Genesis it says I was afraid right that totally right there started breaking the fellowship from God he never was afraid before Adam and Eve could walk up right up to God face to face with no clothes on and just as pure as the day they were formed man right okay but when what happened in the garden it didn't say that Eve was afraid because she really thought she was doing the right thing but Adam knew remember we're talking about iniquity we'll get into that when we get into let your prayers be not hindered would you be just you know a little bit later foreign but Eve Was Not Afraid Adam was afraid right out of that we're out now I was naked and I was afraid right what he was afraid to approach God because he had done what iniquity right and then it says in the last days that the iniquity will abound the love of many that's what we're going to talk about today love a love of many shall wax cold but the double Covenant though bringing the two apart what does it do it enhanced I am you've enhanced at them by coming out we were talking about fellowship and about the vows and how that devours what marries you not any other act past that of the bounds is what marries you all right and we'll read another quote in here that I'll I'll uh I'll read you a little bit later on talking about love that he tells that God brought Adam and Eve together and married them and they were husband and wife and that was before the fall right okay so it wasn't a sex act that made it makes you married it's your vow right it's what comes from here remember it's a spoken word we can't stay with a spoken word amen right all right so that's the original way it should have been but the double Covenant restores order of headship and fellowship it does cause we put man here he used to be head over the woman but to be in that order is to restore everything back to where it's supposed to be Manny all right now and it also does what it gives us a way back right without Eve Adam couldn't reproduce yourself right we know it happens sexually that was permissive of God permissive will to get us here exactly but coming out of that Jesus was born from the womb to bring us back into what Fellowship amen says in Romans 8 for us to be heirs and join heirs with who y'all sleep join Ayers with thank you I know some of you may not want to be yeah don't sound like it but anyway no Covenant so now what's happening is if men we're gonna we're gonna go back through this now if men will act like men another brand I'm saying women would act like women will come back under that Fellowship right where Christ is our head our head because then we're all feminist in the body and spirituality right all of us are and to get back what we what do we have to do we got to reproduce the head amen without Eve haven't couldn't reproduce yourselves right amen so without the church the bride we can't reproduce Christ so when he split them apart he didn't do a disservice that's what brother Randall said because I didn't do a dessert disservice or that wasn't this complementary to God no it was part of the plan right for us to be feminist the bride amen knew we were going to fall to give us a a choice and so that God could be a savior A Healer a redeemer and all those things right because that's what he was he had those attributes he couldn't get rid of them right he had to display him because he was gone man right so he had to display him by not leaving one man because remember creation was over at the sixth day Man was created on Sixth Day right exactly okay so he couldn't create a woman creation was over right he just took a part of salt right oh part of salt water and made salt out of it yeah took a part of Adam and made another part of it not a lesser form but now when we come to where in the Garden of Eden where she did what she did she lost her she lost her co-equalness with God she lost her co-equalness with her husband and and God said since you did what you did we remember we read the the double Covenant there in Genesis three we're not going to read it again for time but then God said okay we got a double Covenant remember last Sunday the double Covenant God is here actually it's a triple Covenant yeah it's god making a covenant with us and then us having a covenant with a woman but let's stay with the double Covenant because brother Brown preached on the double Covenant right Right double Covenant is that we were here we were here now we're here man has rulership over the female because of what happened in the garden right but in doing that that's going to restore his men will stay where they're at women stay where they're at God's gonna run this thing right back around and we're going to go right back into eternity yeah man and woman and be right back where we were had there not been a fall all right exactly now men would act like men and women act like women we will be able to have fellowship and relationship with each other in the Lord yeah all right we're gonna find out today without you and your spouse both having a new birth I'm just gonna let brother Brown because you'll think I'm you think I'm hard on people you're going to let you read what brother but we'll put some quotes up here but now look you get back to where we were going this is going to be a fellowship though based on love God knows that the love of God was was agape love and and if you pull it up now remember what we did a couple weeks ago about um agape love now this is just kind of my definition but it should be doing just well as far as the others Agape Love Is the Love of God right right brother Brown called it Divine love or perfect love exactly all right that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the new birth right but now look when I read this in in Ephesians when it says husband love your wife look in the original it's not filio right everything in the New Testament remember I told you all right you got to remember in the Old Testament it was it was lower form of love it wasn't agape love right not till Jesus come and says love your brother that don't mean love him and feel your love that means love him with agape love right all right so that's what husbands love your wife so let's look at this and not Beloved the love of God Divine love perfect love that was what was in the Garden of Eden right period yeah Adam didn't love woman with feel your love in the garden before the fall exactly but Satan knew he could take what God had perfected amen agape love amen perfected that that's perfect that's Divine love of God perfect love has no other um form and Satan said okay I can make these two do this and I can make them do this what did Brother Brown say he said remember he said you take a you take a woman and she was a street walker went went to a what flapper goes to a prostitute horde all the way down well that's what that's what Satan was doing he took agape love because that's what we're going back to Glory We're Not Gonna feel your love for our wife in the Millennium right right surely not the other two yeah but what Satan has he knew that in agape love was these other characteristics so we come down now we have filial love which is a love between a husband and a wife amen amen natural love Eros which is sexual Central or Lush our storage which is a love between family because see a parent can't love a child in Philly or or the other one better not be because see that's perverted right see I say it's perverted all that and brought it down and it's just a it's just a snowball effect with Satan right you take agape love which is pure and perfect have you ever took a snowball beautiful snowball lay it down and roll it it gets bigger but what happened it gets dirtier because it picks up all the junk unless you you know unless your nose is high when it snows around here it's only about that deep for those that are on the internet so we'll start a snowballing his pure and white but by the time we roll it down the hill make a snowball it's got glass it's got grass clods and and if you live in a field somewhere you know what the other person does well see that's why Satan done he knew that agape love was the love of God he couldn't he cannot imitate that exactly but he can bring it down and imitate it to a way of bringing it down to hey love for spouse sensual lover sexual lover lust and then love between family yeah if you keep that separate that's not so bad because that's the way we live hey without number three we wouldn't be sitting here today right exactly come on please right but what what is it doing if you took that and put it on a roll and rolled it back up you do away with storage Eros feel your love and all you have was adopt me love the love of God that's what we're going back to the love of God when but now what's going to happen God is so good I'm gonna read your quote where brother random said we drop down here in time pick his spouse up took it right back up into eternity right exactly hey some things that that we got to understand that we might not all be some people might not be single when they're over there we may have we may be going to somebody it wasn't Adam by itself exactly it was Adam and Eve right or woman I'm gonna call her e but you know what I'm talking about all right so what's happening now in the double Covenant these other lungs come into effect but it's all got to go back to if you don't have agape love then look what's going to happen anybody can love you I saw in the paper today where somebody was married for 50 years and around here in Gainesville what you find brother then y'all been married how long 57 57 years but now see you've got people that's not born again that love each other truly love that's this love yep only this love can be born again love so don't worry about that you live together fifteen hundred thousand years it really doesn't matter if you don't have this part of you it's just fill your love and it'll go away this right here you have it every day and same with this love between the family parents and children but see that's not what this is why it's not going to happen when we give in glory right but still brother Brown said you will have a spouse you'll know that you brought forth children you'll know who you brought forth and I'll read you a quote maybe the night where he says the family no I'm going to wait and do that with a family but he said the family will be together in heaven amen that's where you believe for your family right believe for your family your family will be there with you in heaven so let's roll this back up because this what's going to happen is we're still living in the world so these are still going to be part of my life right yeah but we're heading back toward the love of God and inside of us that's where it is but we still have to deal with these things in our in our married life all these other three happen every day right but remember they're just temporary or temporal this is the only thing that's going to last for an eternity this is the only thing it's Eternal these will pass away right but we got to still deal with them and live in them so we gotta learn to deal with them and I believe God give us a way to deal with I don't believe that he just threw this thing out here and said here live the live the way you can no he gave us an order that's why he put mail females right he knew you would take this the the more of the the sensual side or the emotional side because that was already an atom he just separated that on into another person called Eve everybody okay with it amen but he started in the garden with agape love but it was deluded by Satan into these other forms of love really all love is permissive except for agape love right all right I'm just reading my notes off again there's a love of God in our heart so if we're born again all these other forms are temporary that is why people with agape love will seek a mate and find true love amen right right listen to this now without a gump in love the motives are motivation for marriage and we're talking about marriage now this is part three on marriage we're talking about love without a Godly love the motives are motivation for marriage is one sexual desire two romantic feelings three good looks some of us is out on that yeah Financial Security a lot of us are out on that but you find people do marry for Financial Security sure listen to this this is for people listen to this one wanting to fit in yeah oh I'm getting old I gotta get married so they can jump and find somebody yeah fear of not getting married or listen to this one and this is the one that happens a lot wanting to escape from their home yeah that happens a lot just wanting to escape from the home don't even know what love is don't even know half what the partner is you just want to get out from home when our children let me tell you one thing your parents are your Holy Ghost until you decide to do something like that but afterwards the dumbness is on you the being dumb is yours right they're trying to do we're trying to do the best we can but God give us a way though and we'll talk about that in the families where the husband and wife should sit down and and talk to your children brother Joe Canada and sister Rachel does a really good job is you know talking to their kids about the Lord and praying with them and and we'll cover that but but that's what we should do if we got away from it so much to where we just stick the kids somewhere and and you know don't pray with them and pray for them and and what do we you know what are we doing we become so busy you know Satan has made us busy oh yeah he's made us busy right we're going to talk about the woman I'm gonna read some quotes that's gonna you know it's gonna really knock us all the head because he said unless you're in financial trouble unless you need to get your finances straight now you sisters are out of your order working in the workplace amen amen telling you what the prophet said not what I said read what the prophet said all right let's go to Ephesians 5. it'll come up on the screen husbands love your wife and the sisters say well y'all are weaker vessels today those things love your wives thank you even this Christ also love the church and gave himself for it that love is not filling your love right if you look in your original that love is a god below all of you New Testament when it talks about love it talks about agape love which is the love of God all right now let's go to Titus two and four listen to this that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children there's your order sisters amen that sober don't mean get out of the liquor closet we'll we'll cover that when we cover the women but I'm telling you we're going to use some of these scriptures twice or three times but we're talking about marriage today between the husband and wife all right we're not separating we're keeping them together all right now listen let's read now from Fellowship Middletown Ohio vote number one now love Fellowship comes my love and love requires Fellowship if you love your wife you've just got to get with her and talk with her let me read that one more time I actually me and you ought to read that yourself I'm being serious here these quotes I'm pulling off because of the way we act right if you love your wife you've just got to get with her and talk with her I'm not gonna ask for amens on that one yeah it will be weak I'm telling you I told you when we started this I'm gonna let the prophet do a lot of talking so it's not me telling you it's him telling you if we believe our prophet that's what he's telling you if you love your friend you've got to get with him and talk to him and if you love God there's got to be a basis of Fellowship you cannot have complete fellowship and out what livelihood right some of you may have some Hood but it's not very Lively without these what agreements right excuse me you cannot be married without an agreement right you cannot have a wife without some kind of an agreement amen and that agreement is based upon your vow right back to last Sunday you're about what you what you said when you were standing at the altar that's your vow until death do us part right sickness and it helps and all those things we read them last Sunday yeah all right let's go to number two thy house number two okay and this is really true because he was in Georgia when he said it maybe no he's in Georgia when he said this one okay yeah she said old Bill she said Hal talked about how fat she was getting in her hair turning gray how many of you Brothers can explode with a prophet honey you could be that wide and I don't know what he said I wasn't there but he said that why and no hair I still love you just the same now he's a liar if he didn't right that's right amen that's right he told a lie he absolutely in his heart very heart he loved his wife so much he didn't care how big she got or how much hair she lost it man because it has to be something there that you have to has to have to meet that you love somebody what something you have to meet what God right that you love somebody unless that person loves another person keep scrolling this is for you young girls it's not married and you boys see when you meet that girl that you love and there's something you know you love her and that's just all there is to it or you love him and that you don't care whether he's handsome or whether he's not handsome or whether she's pretty or not pretty that doesn't matter but you love them just the same now you better watch kind of hold around close there because you're getting close to home there and a marriage based outside of this is sure to fall or it'll never be successful they'll never be happy right all right now number three foreign this is in the masterpiece 1964. am I getting in the way just treat it here today so I don't have to worry about it Pretty Tony said she looked at the back of my head and when she did a quote so notice the Great Masterpiece of the family the husband and wife truly a has to be if they're not they're not a good family life pulling one way and the husband pulling another that would make an awful family but in agreement look how many times he uses the word agreement right that's not argument right it's felt different the last four is Right meant yeah but it's agreement not argument with love one to the other that's a family now that was God's Masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that see and now the Masterpiece family has come again Christ in his pride ready to come the second Adam second e who is us right now are you spiritualized which is okay ready now to return back to their home and the whole picture has been what Redemption right amen from where it was bringing it back see just exactly bringing it back again what back to fellowship all right now let's go to number four now listen to this love should govern the home love is the greatest force that was ever put in the power of a man a home that's not discipline there's one word a home that's not disciplined okay if it's disciplined then if you're daughters cutting her hair you got a discipline her yeah these signs walking around here with his hair over his ears it's not my job to discipline them it's uh yours right a home that's not disciplined by love is not much of a home if the husband and wife doesn't solemnly love each other they cannot trust each other what is that fear right now look at this now love is in two different words two different meanings in the Greek one of them is called filial that's the love that you have for your wife I've got the love it's love divine love now the love that you have for your wife and the love of God Is So contrary yeah not contrary just listen to this right the love that you have for your wife if a man would insult her you'd kill him on the spot with that kind of love I'll feel your love cause and feel your love you can have jealousy and you can have all these different things but with agape love there's one thing it's love not disagreement not anything else but a God we love you pray for his lost soul that'd be the difference there's two different types of love and I'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived with having filial love and thinking it's agape love right right billion love is intellectual right agape love comes from the heart right that's human love affectionate love and godly love Godly love does a question human love reason but Godly love doesn't it's perfect in its Trust it produces faith when you really love right see how important it is to even love your wife it actually produces Faith amen right right Crush all right all those great things there all right number five hey singing I love him I love him because you first love me love love him see what he done for you brother random continues humming I love him it's my love look at this now love brings obedience husbands love your wife I just read the scripture right love brings obedience love brings courtship love brings marriage and that's where we're headed marriage supper of the Lamb all right everybody got that love man obedience courtship married now we're talking about marriage now because 90 of us that in here are married so I thought about starting with that and then going in the other direction back toward the courtship because you know most of our courtships are I don't want to say over but we found our spouse so the courtship part is over but the honeymoon part shouldn't be number six we should be happy about this folks this is where we live I'm happy with my wife amen and I don't care who knows it I'm happy with my salvation and don't care who knows if you're not happy with your wife I doubt you're happy with your salvation oh I'll let brother brown man for that in just a few minutes I'm getting ahead of my notes listen to this right here now this is a really good one the kingsman Redeemer 1960. yesterday morning we were laying in bed a little late they were talking oh sorry and the kids didn't have to go to school and we got speaking about different things what was hatred I said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin and it never will end right right it's Eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty they'll be an end to that right that's right amen right now being into that right and let's just be honest a lot of you that's been married before and ended up something ow but truth anyhow When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty they'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds the man that she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory right man they all death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and not the people but the eternal life they have right but God's not going to take eternal life and if you're joined one as a male and female on Earth you two become what and what God joined together let no man put us under right because they are from eternity and they step into out into the space of time right here and we'll return back to Eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time then it goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish amen no Amen to that right Amen to that I'm gonna read that one more time hatred begins and hatred will end right love agape love never did begin and it never will end it's eternal you see the Eternal quality that he's bringing in here it's an eternal quality it's not just all these other emotions that we have for our families down here all those other loves that we talked about no he's talking about the great agape love When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty they'll get into that right but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why you'll find out why right but you don't know why first and she finds the man that she loved no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal made in glory amen they are death nor nothing else can ever separate them now look folks if you can't look at your spouse right now and say that to her and she say that to you right we got some work to do amen listen work to do people because that's what the prophet told us because they are from eternity and they stepped out into time a space of time and return back to Eternity eternity has dropped down in a body call time this body then it goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish all right amen it was a lot of applications to that right a lot of applications to that but husbands love your wives amen love learn agape love if you learn that all those other three loves will come in line yeah yeah without the first one you got a bunch of junk that's right I lived in a bunch of junk without me loved right you lived in a bunch of junk right without a coffee love right but what did the coffee love do he brought you in line to where you can truly I'm gonna read your quote in a few minutes brother Brown said only the bride in the end time won't know anything about love nobody this whole world can write books and look I appreciate sister Anna and all y'all sending me stuff about this but if a prophet didn't say about love and the Bible didn't say enough about love I don't want to hear anybody else's comment about love right okay I don't want to hear nobody else only a born-again person is supposed to tell me about love amen man I'm not being hard but I'm being hard right I don't want to hear all these other things I want to know what brother Brown said he's the one right he's an absolute right he's our absolute his first one he brought not him as person but this is our absolute what he said right so you know you can read these self-help books and that's okay the light brother Brown said what does it roll from does it roll from from from uh denominational thought about love where you can divorce and do all those other things tell me where true love is right it's only in the people of this message that know what's going on without that making divorce him married 15 times they just take the word of God and just shred it up and throw it away the only true love is what we know in this message right here exactly right now and then with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we connect to that right we connect back to this that's what that Holy Ghost is doing it's pointing you to that it's not pointing you to anything else right it's okay to do that but what are you going to do you're gonna Satan will take that Satan will take a uh somebody that really loves each other and then then you flip it down and and you come down to the brother man talks about the more true love story books then all my children and as the stomach turns and all those you know those things those um he said all my children so that's what they had they had all them all their children the women bro we had all them feelings but what did that do you know what that done brother random you know I Love Lucy was on on Wednesday night number one it kept people out of church yeah but number two it was the first time a camera was put in a bedroom yep but they were fully clothed and on loose pajamas separate beds and said good night and turn the light off who knows how Ricky got made but somewhere in there again but see that was innocent but was that what was that like brother Claus said that was a saying that went forth right right it's okay to do this it's okay to show this to the world yeah then what happened to that then you the then the uh soap operas was the next thing to come up then look what you got two clicks on a computer you got pornography so see what that went from I Love Lucy but see the profit the prophet could see with his Prophet eyes he could see what that was going to in fact you and I didn't so we have to depend on what he said right right to lead us when you said well that's not so bad that's not well no it wasn't at the time but what is it going to right what is it leading us to oh it's okay for us to stay at home and listen to the internet we don't have to go to church now we got it on the internet what's Satan done right right sorry I know the ones you can't get here it's okay but the ones that can get here and I love sister Trudy she may not think I do but they don't love her because she's going to be a witness for for how far from your house from your house to here 249 miles a circle of this church yep I'm not talking about just from Charlotte down to here you know what I'm talking about it's like a radar screen 249 miles from this church she's a witness yeah right when somebody stays home because their cat gets sick yeah or their dogs got diarrhea or or they got a toothache yeah sister 2D drives that whole 249 miles so allow the whole radius of this church if you don't make it to church there's your witness right one woman yeah she's not a preacher she wasn't a man right but she's got a great ministry amen it reaches 249 miles right in a circle I look at little details like that I look at those little things because that's what God does God put somebody in a community brother around said put a woman in the community to pray and read her Bible remember the success of the Chicago meeting was because of two women going to their closets and praying right for the success of that meeting two women remember the baptism of the Holy Ghost is bringing us back to here right because according to my Bible we're to be join heirs with Christ and that's set the new birth but now Sister remember we're still under the double Covenant so don't think you can we'll cover that in the one with the woman we're heading back to that place but as long as we're in time you've still got the double Covenant right still got the mail still got the female underneath all right everybody understand that amen but with the baptism of the Holy Ghost sure I'm only gonna feel a woman can help you but she has a position she doesn't have this position right your sisters ought to think God you don't have to get up here and every soul in the world hanging on what you say that's right what did Jacob say when he called that place Bethel he said it's a horrible place a terrible Place why because here's where judgment begins here's where judgment begins Glory right not judges me first and then brings it to you right all right now let's turn to Corinthians First Corinthians 13. now we read this and we read this at the marriage enrichment and they the NIV version is is a little bit more simpler but let's read this one because charity is love right right all right let's talk about love for just a few minutes I'm not we're not we're going to go to this till till I find a place to stop and it may not be but another 10 minutes but that's okay we're gonna we're gonna cover these things and just kind of let you chew on them a little bit love suffereth long right in other words not quick temper in other words not Quint tempered amen thank you and it's what kind yeah love there's no jealousy right that seem to be right there's no jealousy in love and we're talking about agape love here we're not talking about remember that filter's down right right if you have agape love you can understand these things now I'm not saying you're going to do them all every day we're not a walking zombie we have problems in our life all right but look it charity vaulteth not itself let me put that in in 2012 words charity is not self-centered right I I mean me that's what causes a lot of divorce in the world today me yes oh Mom okay yeah that's right charity is not self-centered right doesn't make you think you're better than somebody else which is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly right right in other words don't not misbehaving seeketh not her own what me me Hi man this is pretty much a lot of this is all self-centered it's not easily provoked boy someone you fell off right there yeah it's not easily provoked thinketh no evil in other words you're not sitting around drumming up stuff and we'll read the quote in just a minute Rejoice is not an iniquity we do not rejoice when somebody Falls or falls out of love or falls out of church we don't Rejoice well no what is it pains us it hurts us but rejoices in the truth love marriage all things right bear with your spouse amen bear with your children bear with your brothers sisters church family believeth all things now that is believeth all things in the Lord amen yeah right all right that's what that is believe us all things in the Lord because the Bible is talking about spiritual things on this part here hope is all things and it's patient amen endure right those who endure to the end all right we'll get all these things right no charities love suffereth long kind envious not Envy remember the Bible talks about envying Strife sedition we can bring in a lot of scriptures here but we won't but let's go ahead and let's bring in uh quote number seven listen to this I think Christ's revealed and don't work 1965. I've been this week down in the country staying with some very dear friends I asked someone at the table yesterday when we was eating we always sit around have a little little study on the Bible we was talking about love now they're talking about love get the story but look what comes out of it and there was a certain person said to me I believe you're Antichrist I'd like to you know what brother Brown didn't get up and give him a last hook across the table yeah I said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him if he should cast me into hell all right I still will love him if I go with the same spirit I have now right say we can say that right we can say you can cast me into hell I'll still love you and may not mean it but he said if I go with the same spirit I have now in other words nothing welled up inside of him nothing was against this man that says I believe you're Antichrist I don't believe there was nothing in that man that he envied that man or or did anything you know he could have said well bless God I'm the prophet no what'd he do yeah if that'd be pleasing to my Lord that's okay yeah if I go with the same spirit I have now he looked at me kind of strange yeah I've seen four or five of them there young men young wives fine women I know how them boys love their wives so I said to them I said here's the way to test if your wife before you were married now you go back save this married life you've been dreaming you were married yeah yeah here's a way to test it I'll start again if you were white before you were married now you go back say this married life you've been dreaming you were married but you really wasn't married but you dreamed you were and you woke up and you went and talked it over with your girlfriend said you know I dreamed that we were married and we had children we living happy and waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything and then this girl would say to you you know I love another man better than I love you I could be happier with the other man could you from your heart love her well enough to say God's blessings rest upon you my dear go with this other man did you yeah now now check that each of you men are you women see well if your love is correct you would do that for you're interested in her welfare right what you know you could have her you can live with her she's your wife she will be she'll marry you but she won't be happy she would be happier and then if you love her then you want her to be happy therefore whatever the will of God is that God's will be done whether I'm happy with it or not I want to live so he will be pleased with what I do therefore check your objective and your motive by that you know whether you love God or not what if he'd say you serve me if I'm going to cast you away I'll let him in a happy man's right your objective and your motive now active and motive think about those two things what is motive that's your motivation behind what you do right all right your objective is something you're going toward right the objective of us going to eat is that it's going to be lunch in a few minutes and the objective of that is we're hungry and want to go eat right but it's something we're heading toward and we know we're going to that all right say we're building a house our objective is it's to build it a certain way but what is our motivation to live in it same way with your love of God and your love for your spouse and your love for your children all that check your objective and your motive is it self-centered yeah come on people is it self-centered right right if the wife is a weaker vessel we should submit all things we're going to read it out in just a little bit don't worry you ain't all just them being submission to us and all that good stuff right all right let's go to Romans 12 and 9. let love be without dissimulation right amen no argument no no no nothing a that which is evil and what do we say about Cleve last Sunday that word cleave means in the original glue yeah in other words glue to that which is good or stick stick to that which is good all right first John 4 18. there is no what what was Adam's first problem yeah yeah he was afraid he was afraid to meet gun because the fellowship had been disconnected but there is no fear in love but perfect love casts this out fear because fear has torment now we can take this in a spiritual aspect but look let's just take this into natural love just regular let's just drop down to fill your love there shouldn't be no fear in love but there is because we don't have agape love all right but perfect love agape love casts out fear because fear hath what that's right torment that's why brother Branham said what he said to that to those people if you love that sister enough to let her be happy somewhere else whether it hurts you inside or not physically you know naturally right I have no fear because you're in the right motive and objective right so you're not tormented by it you won't be tormented by if you allow that to happen because you're giving you're subjecting yourself and saying hey if she can live better with somebody else now we're talking about before we're mad I ain't talking about sitting here talking about you got to do this all right I don't want anybody in the on the internet to misinterpret what I'm saying and I'm not saying to you people are already married brother Brandon was making an illustration of somebody before they were before they got married all right so now fear half torment need it fear it read it yeah he that feareth is not made perfect in love amen because perfect love cast out fear right all right now let's go to Hebrews chapter 3 well it's going to be a quote number eight listen to this we're gonna read this and and then this afternoon we're going to start on a three-dimensional love has to be you know you're a body experience a soul right okay we'll talk about three-dimensional love this afternoon but we'll be done right here you'd asked him about it well we got our television that's how we find Comfort see that's the American attitude see we got television we got plenty of money we got Fine Cars we got nice homes what do we need with the Lord we don't need that and that's the attitude about the only religion and salvation we have and love is among the real godly people right you know the Bible said that will happen congregation says amen uh-huh you Bible readers I heard you holler a man and you preachers back there that's right the love would be so far away right in the last days the only love there would be left would be between the elect of God's people father would be against mother mother against father and children against parents how many of you seen that children killing their parents and parents killing their children physically have you seen that why fear anxiety emotion stress just keep that one they have no objective or motive right you say yeah they do no they don't if I had an objective and a motive they'd be focused on what they're doing because what did Satan do he took he took that and perverted it the love would be so far away in the last days the only love there would be left will be between the lack of God's people follow me against mother mother against father and children against parents and different ones against each other and the only love would be left would be just that elect just the elected the word elect there comes from the word elected God's elected now let's read one more scripture to make it go for this afternoon Matthew 22. this is something to think about for this afternoon because out in the world you have a one or two dimensional love body and spirit yeah but the reason that we have a complete love is because we have Body Spirit and soul going in the right direction amen Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord God with all thy heart all thy soul and all thy mind amen this is the first and great commandment amen husbands love your wife with all your heart with all your souls and with all your mind love your husbands with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind man because if you love the Lord we'll read a quote this afternoon then men now what's going to happen we're going to read some things this afternoon and brother Brown is going to kind of pick through this and pick some quotes out that he made but it comes down to where Abraham and Sarah where Sarah called him more he said if you don't act like a Lord she ain't gonna call you that yeah but being a true godly man you receive that just like you say this right here Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all your heart soul and mind now we're going to be that way down here love our spouses because if I if the order is different down here you can't connect up there right I mean this is just like brother remember this is just primer thing this is just the primary stuff right but still if we don't get this done if we don't get this settled then what's going to happen right Satan is going to do it I promise you he is going to come in and he is going to put a knife somewhere in between and it's going to be a wedge right or what a division and you don't want division we're trying to put this thing back together man Satan is the one that divided all of us up right from fellowship remember I was afraid there's no fearing God we read that there's no fear in God yeah so where'd that fear come from it was a little part of Adam that was a human that Satan could get to a Son of God yes son of God let me get to you be done and pray for me I'm the only man in the world that he does then I think we all can't keep him busy but we got what the division the headship is there but all this is coming back to where it all is going to mount back together again all right all right so that's what God's wanting us to do and I think what he's done was give us so much stuff to do and things to do with the world because the world don't have love as we should have love and I'll read you some more things in here and let's stand so we will start this afternoon right there with a three-dimensional love because true love requires three parts amen you love with your body and your spirit all the other three all the other the Eros and the and the filial love and the storage you can do that with your body and your spirit right because the person a good person can do that out in the world but to be truly one with God that Third Realm or that little realm inside of you is called the soul that's your motivator and motivating its way out and we'll we'll we'll use some quotes and some scripture and brother Joe was released this morning at 10 40 from the hospital so praise God for that man I remember when you had your appendix taken out my Heavens used out for two three weeks and you know sore and it cuts you from here to here you know and gallbladder surgery too and then and now all they do is just make a few holes and go in there and just cut it out a little at a time and take that thing out without any incision but you know God had to heal that part all right man couldn't do that they just took out what was bad and then God healed the rest of them you know that so we give God all the honor and Glory you love him amen love him then you're heading all the way loving each other right amen amen all right marriage part three from this afternoon will be marriage part four we're going to talk about motive and objective again three-dimensional love and that true love requires all three parts amen okay I know and I know it's hard no one say this to right now before I forget it it's real hard for you that don't have your spouse here but we're praying for that right right okay but you truly can't be one without the baptism of the Holy Night amen okay you really can't you can't be truly one without the Holy Ghost all right either you both don't have it or one diet one don't but see you're working towards something and I'm not all right they maybe say some things in here that it may be hard to understand maybe for some of the young people but you look that we do live in the in the dimensions of of Body Spirit and soul that motivates us and before we go we're motivated by CK still smelling here right memory reason conscious affection and Imagination right consciousness Perfection love female love R.E Ross our storage that happens in that second realm right but when you take that though and you put it in it all in that to take that third Rim which is Faith about our love or hatred right all right there's only two right say faith or that one I just read you faith is love right and hatred is of the devil right all right let's say something do you ever need 93 inch Power 93 inch power bill this thing we got a little time we've seen them say a couple of songs I know this is not some kind of outstanding emotional thing but maybe it will be when you get home I don't know foreign much the man the man become crazy he got rid of all jobs drop down and if there's a whole ocean right which is more water was full of me and every tree you see with a quilt a right whip for a man ascribed by trade in the skies were just a parchment a roll of paper it drained the ocean right nor could this floor contain the hole in those fish from Scottish kind you know that man probably couldn't attain to this but you and I can Glory right you and I can attain to this because we got the person that is Love Inside Amen Brother Richard he was looking for that person and couldn't find him because of certain things in the world but if you look for him and you find him then you found a love of God right how rich and pure how measureless and strong you know to a human being that is majorless but when you and I get in that City that's gonna be amen love Glory that's going to be everything that this person looked for it's going to be right there and you and I gonna be a part of it right because we're going to be in that City you love the Lord that's our heads the heavenly father we pray Lord that you would just be with us now as we go eat a natural meal Lord and come back at two o'clock and receive Lord maybe some more spiritual food from you father pray Lord that the word just been spoken this morning that they will not be void Lord but would would return in the quickening power of your spirit Lord that it would make each of us live closer together with our spouses and then also live closer together as one in you father we pray Lord at the things we've said would not hinder anyone Lord but would strengthen Lord and make each one just take an account Lord of what they're doing in their daily lives and the things that they do Lord we all Lord we all do our own things father and we pray that you would just be with us Lord and bring those things to our remembrance the things that we do that are not pleasing to you Lord so that we can quickly repent get those things out of the way Lord so that the love of God will shine upon each one of us you give us the greatest message and the greatest hour to the greatest people father now let us not take it lightly let us not take it Lord as it was it's a second playing second fiddle Lord we want you to have preeminence in our lives be the number one thing and theme and goal all of our motive and objective is to please you father play bless each one Lord be with each one of us as we go eat a natural meal Lord we ask your blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen you're dismissed a mic this afternoon that sounds like a home to me sorry let go crazy
