========================================

hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving time with your family and friends this is this is my my favorite holiday of the year we we got plenty of things to be thanksful thankful for don't we God is good to us let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we're so grateful to be able to gather together today Lord and around your word and I pray Lord that just us bless our gathering I bless brother Wade as he's preparing Lord and bless our hearts Lord Lord Jesus to prepare us to receive what you have in store for us today I pray you'll bless this little study as we go through these scriptures Lord God and just Quicken it to us give us something to help and encourage Lord we pray in your name amen now we're on Hebrews chapter 13: 7 that says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and so we've just kind of been diving into this remember them which have the rule over you and you know if you really study that out there's there's two ways that e either either uh the word of God will claim your life and the and the Holy Ghost is actually ruling you through the preaching of the true gospel or men's ideas will will will will uh rule over you and it's it's uh and so we've kind of been examining that nickan spirit that began to move in the in the in the very first church age that Antichrist Spirit to to limit the moving of the Holy Ghost and to counteract uh to to counteract that and so you know remember them which have the rule over you you really think about maybe one example would be Phillip running up to that Ethiopian unic and the Ethiopian unic saying I I I want to understand what I'm reading here and Philip saying you do you do you understand and he sits down with with him and begins to explain and as he explains the word something begins to grab hold of that man's uh heart and he you know they pass by some water as they're riding in that Chariot and he says I you know I what what what prevents me from going down and getting baptized so what what's ruling in there in that situation not a man's idea but the word is actually claiming his life and begins to to to he begins to he begins to see what that scripture in Isaiah is talking about begins to identify by Jesus Christ with the scriptures and begin to say well you're telling me how to be baptized and who this man is and I I want to fulfill the scriptures so he goes the the word is actually moving him to do that and uh counteract that with on the other side um down through the Dark Ages and down through history you've got priest you know like this picture a man with his eyes blinded he can't see the scripture you got somebody leaning over his shoulder like the the priest telling him well I'll tell you how to get somebody out of purgatory you need to pay me some money give me your cow and I'll and that'll fund my prayers to get somebody out of the Purgatory and they're actually limiting the moving of the Holy Ghost because how can the Holy Ghost move across false Doctrine and and and and so they got that that organization is actually preventing God from being able to move in in in the fullness that or you see oh you see why why full the full Doctrine the Full Gospel that we have in this hour is so important it's supposed to unleash the full the the ability of the Holy Ghost to move forward in our lives amen so what what is nickan ISM why did God hate their deeds if you go back and examine uh so that's that's really what we're talking that rule that man man's ideas ruling over people ruling over the situation instead of the Holy Ghost now brother Ram said in the first seal he said now remember let's just take our time and read some of these quotes he said now remember about the time Christ come on the throne the Antichrist Christ come on the throne Judas about the time Christ went off the Earth Judas went off the Earth just about the time the Holy Spirit Come Back the Antichrist come back you know John said over here little children I would not have you ignorant you know about the Antichrist which he's already come and working in the children of Disobedience the Antichrist then there he was began to form and there the nickan spirit to make an organization so now we we're just labeling things nickan Spirit Antichrist Spirit mystery of iniquity tack all those things together that's what he's talking about the Antichrist Spirit then that was begin to form there and the nican spirit to make an organization he said no wonder I hated that thing see there you are it wasn't me it was something in here there's the thing it's come out you see you see it I was all around the sides of it I couldn't see it till now I know it now there it is that nickan Spirit God hated and now that Spirit become incarnate and they crowned it and here it is right here what the Bible said they do with it perfect what does it say that he he hated it back there in Revelation Chapter 2 Under the ANG right when it first started moving under the angel of the Church of Ephesus remember therefore from which Thou Art fallen in verse six but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate now as we study this out you can really kind of begin to see why God would hate that cuz he he wants the true gospel to be preached so that he can have Liberty in the congregation to be able to move and to do to to baptized with the Holy Ghost to be able to fill people with the spirit and and that nickel an idea that man's idea that's contradicting it it's really the devil prevents that so you see these two things these two these two things God moving with a genuine moving and something that's fake the Antichrist Spirit the devil moving taking maybe taking just one word off twisting the thing so that God can't move now you got and now brother Brown said in the second seal he said now watch first nickan the nician was called in the Bible Antichrist because it was against the original doctrine of Christ and the apostles now I've got a little picture here that shows the first seal and you can see these two these two forces just toose you got a lion on one side and then a white horse on the other side and what did Brother Ram say in the first day he said that's what that that's that white horse rider under the way of a white righteous church but an antichrist it's got to look like on a horse even just like Christ is coming on a horse so close and deceive the very elect here he is he's the Antichrist he started riding in the first church age now he rides on down on down through every age so what what's that white horse signifying that nickan Antichrist Spirit or an anointed one starting off some to counteract the real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost in the first seal brother R said at the end time these books that's been rolled up all this time with these mysteries in them is broken then out comes the mystery to see what it is but actually they started forth at the first church age because at the first church age received the message a white horse rider went out see who is he he's Mighty in his conquering power as a great fellow in his conquering power you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist that's exactly what he is now because you see if an antichrist Jesus said that the two would be so close together until it would deceive the very elected the bride if it was possible if it was possible what what's going to keep you from being deceived though a true understanding of the word you got a revelation a real Revelation that's been unfolded to you and you won't be able to be deceived in in this if if the word is fully unfolded to you Antichrist is the Antichrist spirit and in the Ephesian Church H he said what the church had at Pentecost is her inable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in divers signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost there's what God wants God wants each individual in the church to be led by the Holy Ghost and have their own relationship with God right it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern and in the pergam peran church age he said you will recall that I brought out in the Ephesian age that the word nickan comes from two Greek words nio which means to conquer and Leo which means the Le nickan means to conquer the Le now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness he has placed his church in the care of God ordained spirit filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word he has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation further there is no no place in the word where priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord God wants all to love and serve him together nanism destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants now we're what we're examine was we're examining that nickan Spirit he said in the Ephesian Church age he said well here we'll take it when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one place and one Accord and the pastor came down and preached a fine sermon and say give me the right hand of fellowship and we'll put your name on the book that don't sound right does it you might get that you couldn't get that in an Alman act they know better than that the old lady's birthday Almanac is more correct than that would be well what caused that then the nickan bringing in a bunch of men to twist up the scripture and make a denomination now here's the clencher here's the essence of that nickan spirit that can't let God move in it that can't let God move dies right there Then he said you're dead you got to name you're living but you're dead many of them dead and don't know it and the sardian church AG he said it was quite a large church at the beginning but they started a denominational Spirit coming among them trying to denominate the church which was called the Deeds of the nicians the Deeds of the nicians now it wasn't a Doctrine yet and then we took the word and broke it down what was Deeds what was nickan that's a foreign name to us so I took the Greek and broke it down and niik means to conquer or to overcome or overthrow something nickan a deed a Deeds that was trying to overthrow the Le and put all the blessing and the only one to read the Bible the only one to give the interpretation would be the bishop or some great head person of the church why is that so bad because God wants you to have your own personal relationship God wants you to experience the power of the Holy Ghost in your life God wants you to experience the liberty of the Holy Ghost in your life and when you got a priest like that picture I I lean over your head that picture that we were looking at and your eyes are blinded and it's all put on somebody else then that's contrary to what God wants to see done in your life God wants you to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ the Ephesian Church age build around said now Paul's wolves had become nickan they were trying to form a priesthood like the levitical priesthood which was foreign to the New Testament Doctrine the word niik means to conquer overcome overcome what the Ley the Holy Spirit take out of the church the resurrected Lord Jesus with signs and wonders among the Believers and put men voted in to be a pope or a carnal Cardinal or an overseer trying to take the Holy Ghost away from the Le and give it to a order called The Holy order of men placing them over the lady not to call them pastors which means Shepherds but Father which Jesus said don't you call no man father on this Earth see that evil thing and what did we do why do you call not call any man father because you didn't get that eternal life from a man you got it from God God is your father when you begotten of him he's put his own life in you and you call him father brother that's why we go back to that quote that we've been reading it is the word that rule rules us this is Brother brand I'm explaining that scripture obey them which have the rule over you it's the the word that rules us not men now as a man as a husband as head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word and the Ephesian Church age again he said it started out in the early church it was called Deeds then it became a Doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over and what happened God was pushed aside which is always what happens when you begin to take man's ideas instead of the word of God and begin to like they did all down through the church ages organize it until they were they had a pope over them oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seemed so sound then it c a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church now that's what the nickan that's why God hates the de and nicians cuz it's strangling out all the spirituality the signs and wonders the Liberty the movement of the Holy Ghost and the people that are sitting in the congregation oh that false Vine is subtle it is like an angel of Light until it gets a hold on you now I want to say that I believe in leadership but is it is not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word he said I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one he said in again in the Ephesian Church age he said Paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would Implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit Ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the lity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and and what all participated in spiritual worship oh there's when you're really fulfilling where we all have our licks of fire that we bring together and here sitting together in the congregation it's like one great big Pillar of Fire come together because everybody's got their own relationship with God right not just one man and the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time God gives a visitation of the Holy Spirit and people get free after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of amen he said again they set the word aside deny the work of the spirit of God subjugate the lady and make it impossible for the lady to worship God unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from Satan himself and the sman church she said the Lutheran Revival never did rise up again the West Revival never did rise up again the Nazarene Revival did not rise up again neither will the Pentecostal Revival rise up again why because you killed it you hybrid it with the world with the nickan idea not let the Holy Ghost have its way that's right you hybrid the church and it can't breed itself back again so what's the conclusion of the matter remember them which had the rule over you not by ruling not by ruling with man's ideas whether with our own carnal thoughts or things to organize like into a denominational system or something like that but ruling with the word by preaching the gospel so that the Holy Ghost can have Liberty in this assembly and change people's lives by the true teaching of the word remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow why are you following because it's the true it's true according to the gospel according to the Bible considering the end of their conversation in other words remember your leaders and the consequences of their faith in God and We examined that a few week weeks ago that you can look at the lives of the people that that have been preaching the gospel and examine them and see that see the effect of the Gospel on their life and remember what their faith wrought in their own life and and that will give you confidence confidence to believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever now now what's that mean now let's examine that for a little bit that he would act the same now there's a true a true understanding of the Gospel that'll give you Liberty to know that he'll act the same that he did back there yes that he's the same yesterday today and forever Amen brother Brown said if that is the same Spirit here as it was then it'll manifest the word like it did then and you see how these things stack on one another if you got the true the true gospel being preached that it will allow the true genuine Holy Ghost to move there's no he said there's no difference in him at all he lives in his church doing the same thing that means that the same signs and wonders that were done in the early church could be done in today because he still the same let's examine what he says here he said if that is the same holy spirit that was in the wilderness with Israel and also was in Jesus Christ it's now in the church it does the same works because it's the same light it's the same Spirit if you could just believe that friend he said in Hot Springs Arkansas he said and brother when you try to read of a painted fire of Pentecost and somebody tries to tell you that the Holy Spirit isn't the same today as it was then somebody tries to tell you the days of Miracles has passed that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever that they try to tell you don't you believe it them is not pictures God Almighty sent that message to you that's right it's for you and to your children to them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call God is still God Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he is right here tonight to save the lost to heal the sick to fill the Holy Spirit those who desire to be filled and I pray maybe that now you you know you you go back and remember that picture I showed of The Lion and the white horse rider and maybe that will begin to unfold what that really represents something fake to keep you from the true moving of the Holy Ghost an antichrist Spirit to prevent the holy ghost from having Liberty in your life and something genuine something real a lion that represents the power of the holy ghost moving in the people and those two things are are battling out they're battling out right now they're still moving but God wants you to recognize that he is still the same as he always is always has been and brother R said in the patriarch Abraham he said if you can't take that word test then if you doubt it little suspicious of it you can't hardly believe it there's something or other you can't believe it then don't you come in the prayer line I wouldn't even fool around the altar till you can get enough Grace to know that God's word is true right and when you once break through that veil of unbelief then you got the keys in your hands of death hell and the grave because you've got a conqueror who conquered for you then you've got Hebrews 13:8 that tells us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh to see to to not recognize that that he's still the same it's like you being being having your mind veiled off to really the true essence of and that's what the word the word was given to us to break through those things so that God can have Liberty in our life yes he said in wisdom versus Faith How could a lily live a lily seed live and grow when it thrives on Waters grow and one of those Dusty denominations where that nickol and spirit's moving what to prevent the holy ghost from being able to move how could it do it when it thrives on water water is the spirit they have a form of godliness but deny the power of the spirit see through the word falls on them it can't though the word falls on them it can't grow it can't grow grow just like the word was on Eve but it couldn't grow why she accepted wisdom Satan's wisdom the word comes to them the word falls on them sure it does it'll fall on them they can hear the word preached did you ever see people set in the church they never will make a move preach to women about bobbed hair year after year still got bobbed hair talk to men about smoking women about drinking they drink right on just the same just like pouring water on a duck's back it ain't got no place to grow it's that old pleasure seeking popularity well let the rest of the women do it first then I will I don't care what they do it's your duty to follow the word of God though the word falls on them it can't grow Satan's wisdom see so it just becomes denominational dust they can't believe in Hebrews 138 all puffed up with the wisdom nothing for it to grow in how can they believe Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever couldn't do it see oh they say they believe it oh you tell them that they say sure we believe it then show me the fruits of it let me see it let me see it being done let me see the church that you're preaching to do what they did and the First Apostolic Church then that believe the word you see what he's saying he's saying if you really believe Hebrews 13:8 that will produce the same Christ that was man ested in the early church age you'll see that same God moving if you believe it like that he said in scriptural signs of the time remember our God is still the god of Elijah he is still the God that he ever was he is still the same God he moves in the same cycle he does the same thing he is the same yesterday today and forever I've seen them stand dumbfounded paralyzed and taken off the field God Still Remains God he said if I had had listened to reasons there would probably have been thousands of people died years ago but I carried a message exactly like he said around and around the world and I'm going again by the grace of God not by reasons but by a commission I lean not you say you're 55 years old if I was 95 that don't mean a thing amen and we'll stop on this as the musicians come forward he is still the same God that he was with Abraham he is still the same yesterday today and forever he is still the same God to any man that's been called to take the word of God God will stand by him if he don't be a calary God bless you amen than
