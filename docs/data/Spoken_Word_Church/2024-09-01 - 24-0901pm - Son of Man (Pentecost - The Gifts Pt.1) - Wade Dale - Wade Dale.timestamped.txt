[13:55] your life don't take it for granted
[13:58] don't get so focused on the struggles
[14:00] that you miss the
[14:02] gift don't get so focused on the
[14:05] struggles that you miss the gift that
[14:06] God's got for you today that's what
[14:08] we're going to talk about we're going to
[14:09] talk about the gifts at Pentecost that
[14:13] we have they're available for us listen
[14:17] sorry when God gives you a
[14:19] gift he ain't going to take it back
[14:22] either but remember God doesn't do
[14:25] anything unless he's already got it
[14:27] thought out first
[14:29] so he's not going to give you a gift and
[14:30] you ruin it now you may ruin it but he's
[14:32] not going to give you the
[14:35] gift and then you not fulfill it we are
[14:39] absolutely folks listen we're standing
[14:42] on the brink of just maybe even a couple
[14:45] of years and we'll be out of here we
[14:47] ain't talking 10 five three maybe the
[14:51] way things are progressing now with the
[14:52] way that the new election's coming up I
[14:55] don't
[14:56] know we're we're heading toward uh um
[15:00] we're heading towards some tough times
[15:01] maybe but it's supposed to be the most
[15:04] glorious time in the life of the Bride
[15:08] is the end
[15:10] time because it's a fullness she's fully
[15:13] dressed she's ready they've been getting
[15:16] ready for 2,000 years but remember this
[15:19] bride has made herself ready amen
[15:22] through a profit in the end time to
[15:24] bring us a restored word of God not a
[15:26] reformed word of God a restored word of
[15:28] God I believe it's going to happen and I
[15:30] believe if I'm not part of it my eyes
[15:32] are going to see it one of the two that
[15:35] we're going to see this thing to the end
[15:37] there is nothing else there's nothing
[15:39] else left there's no other denomination
[15:41] there's no other place for us to go
[15:43] that's right thereby with me on that I
[15:46] just believe that that's my belief or I
[15:48] wouldn't do this so let's bow our
[15:51] heads de heavenly father thank you again
[15:54] for this service we have a Time Lord to
[15:57] speak about you father I I pray that you
[15:59] do the speaking let they let the people
[16:01] see you Lord and not a man standing
[16:03] behind here Lord with all kind of faults
[16:05] and failures ideas Lord contrary to you
[16:08] father I pray that you'd just take over
[16:10] today Lord take over the speaking but
[16:13] also take over the
[16:14] hearing Lord as you did on the day of
[16:16] Pentecost you you took over the hearing
[16:19] Lord I pray that we hear from you Lord
[16:21] hear what the spirit says to the church
[16:25] father forgive us of our many mistakes
[16:26] Lord be with the ones that are sick be
[16:28] with the ones on on the highways brother
[16:29] Bob coming home there from Brother
[16:31] Duchess different places we got them
[16:33] scattered around Lord I pray that you'd
[16:34] bring them back home safe father just be
[16:37] with us now to furless service in Jesus
[16:39] name amen so we're going to talk a
[16:41] little just a little bit about the gifts
[16:43] Joel 2 verse 28 and it shall come to
[16:45] pass afterwards now listen God's word's
[16:47] never going to fail right that's right
[16:49] it's going to come to pass amen whether
[16:51] we want to or not all right we were
[16:53] talking downstairs brother brother Joe
[16:55] canid um brought out a good point God's
[16:58] got a permissive will you just saw it
[17:02] Moses it said when you were watching the
[17:03] screen here Moses got in the permissive
[17:06] will of God but it's always going to
[17:08] work to the perfect will of God that's
[17:10] right it's not going to work permissive
[17:12] all the time it's got to come to a
[17:14] perfect will of God and we'll read this
[17:15] today where Paul said we do this in part
[17:18] we do this in part we prophesy in part
[17:20] but that which is perfect is come that
[17:22] which is imp part to be done away all
[17:24] right so we believe the perfect one is
[17:26] here not coming we believe the perfect
[17:27] one is here all right says it will come
[17:31] to pass that I will pour out my spirit
[17:32] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[17:34] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[17:36] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[17:37] see visions and also upon the servants
[17:40] and the handmaid in those days will I
[17:41] pour out my spirit you may be seated in
[17:44] the Lord as His blessings to the reading
[17:45] of the word Acts 2 verse1 says when the
[17:48] day I can fly now Lis don't have to
[17:50] interpret so he he can rest for a little
[17:52] bit go for it brother thanks okay and
[17:55] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[17:56] they were all with one Accord in one
[17:58] place place and suddenly there came a
[18:00] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[18:02] Wind and it filled all the house where
[18:04] they were sitting and there appeared
[18:06] unto them clothing tongues like as of
[18:08] fire and it sat upon each of them do you
[18:11] know who wrote
[18:12] that you know who wrote the book of
[18:15] act
[18:17] Luke he wasn't
[18:21] there that's truly by
[18:24] Revelation there appeared in the vision
[18:27] he saw there appeared clothing tongues
[18:30] over their head now whether they saw
[18:31] them when they were sitting there or not
[18:33] I don't know we've seen the pillar of
[18:35] fire we've seen it we got pictures of
[18:36] the pillar of fire but I believe it
[18:38] looked like the pillar of fire little
[18:40] licks of fire over every one of them and
[18:43] it wasn't different diff it wasn't
[18:44] different licks it was the same lick of
[18:46] fire
[18:48] yes and sat on each of them 120 of them
[18:52] and they were all filled with the Holy
[18:53] Ghost right
[18:55] then and began to speak with other
[18:57] tongues as a spirit
[18:59] gave them utterance so as we were
[19:01] talking this morning it's important to
[19:02] know that if God said the alpha bride
[19:04] and Omega bride was going to be the same
[19:06] he had to bring he had to develop one
[19:08] just as he developed the other one right
[19:10] so there had to be a Pentecost there had
[19:12] to be this time right here where in
[19:14] Jerusalem there was thousands of people
[19:16] there they had never heard of this holy
[19:17] ghost thing they they that some knew
[19:20] Jesus had come thought he was just a
[19:21] good man thought he was this but he's
[19:24] disappeared even his body's gone the
[19:26] there there's nothing there's nothing to
[19:28] show he's living here anymore but
[19:30] there's 120 people did what he said they
[19:33] went to the upper room he said go and
[19:35] wait on the Holy Spirit or until you're
[19:38] endued with power from on high well see
[19:40] that's where truly as we're reading that
[19:42] isua street how the isza street you know
[19:45] they always called they had a Terry room
[19:47] well that's what they would do if you
[19:49] wanted to receive the Holy Ghost there'd
[19:50] be a room in the on side of the church
[19:53] and you go t there and wait pray sing do
[19:56] whatever until the Holy Ghost fell on
[19:58] you or people laid hands on you and
[20:00] that's where you that's why he said
[20:03] t they went to the upper room and they T
[20:05] that's where they get that from you
[20:06] don't have to do that that was just a
[20:09] something they came up with you don't
[20:11] have to do that you don't have to go in
[20:12] a room and and and do some formula or
[20:16] wait on something you can get the Holy
[20:18] Ghost right where you're sitting that's
[20:19] what happened on on after Pentecost
[20:21] there was a man preaching the sermon and
[20:23] the Holy Ghost fell on the group of
[20:25] people and they received the Holy Ghost
[20:27] all right now we know it's for which you
[20:29] can lay on hands we know there's
[20:30] different things you can do but you can
[20:32] receive it right there in your seat I
[20:34] wasn't even in a church when I received
[20:35] the Holy
[20:37] Ghost brother Brion wasn't
[20:39] either he was on the he was on the rail
[20:42] railroad or he was in a in a somewhere
[20:45] and he said that one guy remember he
[20:46] went out in a pig pin and got that Holy
[20:48] Ghost out in the pig pin or that's not a
[20:51] good place to be but it's a good place
[20:53] to be if that's where the Holy Ghost is
[20:55] if you're going to receive it that's a
[20:56] great place to be and some kind God to
[20:59] put you in that
[21:02] place he knows what we need I want y'all
[21:05] to know that he knows what we need
[21:08] before we even breathe tomorrow's first
[21:10] breath in the morning he knows what we
[21:12] need amen the Holy Ghost is not somebody
[21:16] that will tell you wrong the Holy Ghost
[21:18] is not somebody that'll do you wrong
[21:21] amen so everything he does is right what
[21:23] the problem is is we can't get it
[21:25] together sometimes with our own Humanity
[21:27] cuz we still are a three room
[21:31] house
[21:33] amen but we got to yield we got to yield
[21:36] ourself to that power right and forget
[21:40] ours that's right not my will but thy
[21:43] will be done so on the day of Pentecost
[21:46] over here in
[21:47] 8030 they received the Holy Ghost then
[21:51] you look through 2,000 years man got a
[21:54] hold of it and like I said before if you
[21:56] watch that uh I don't know if you look
[21:57] that go to YouTube and put Ina Street
[22:00] and there's an old black sister that was
[22:02] at the Revival and an old black brother
[22:04] and they're interviewing them and it's
[22:06] so far back the interview is done with a
[22:08] a little bitty microphone that's got a
[22:10] cord on it it's not even cordless I

[22:18] involved everything got invol got was
[22:21] just fine she should just sweet humble
[22:24] said but man got
[22:25] involved wow if she saw
[22:32] that if that little sister saw that it
[22:35] must have happened really really I mean
[22:37] it must have been really bad which we
[22:38] know it is cuz when brother randam walks
[22:40] on the scene you've not got a Pentecost
[22:43] one denomination you got probably a
[22:45] hundred different factions Church of God
[22:47] Church of God of Prophecy some some play
[22:50] the piano some don't play the piano some
[22:52] get the Holy Ghost because of this and
[22:54] they get the Holy Ghost because of that
[22:55] and and right brother Brandon remember
[22:58] carnal impersonations came out of that
[23:00] Pentecost because I wasn't kidding this
[23:03] morning there's two Spirits one's holy
[23:05] and one's
[23:08] not there's only two
[23:10] Spirits one's holy and one's not so you
[23:14] can differentiate yourself but this one
[23:18] over here that's not can act almost like
[23:21] this one that is come on anointed ones
[23:23] at end time it can be the true Holy
[23:26] Ghost but you can be anointed you in
[23:28] your soul there's got to be something
[23:30] that keeps that out and who is it it's
[23:31] the devil right it's your and my idea
[23:35] that's contrary to the word of God
[23:36] instead of yielding and letting God just
[23:39] sweep on through and take care of all of
[23:40] it we start slamming
[23:43] doors well I do so pray for
[23:46] me Isaiah 53 the people on the the
[23:50] brothers and sisters 120 now remember
[23:52] Mary was there so there was women and
[23:55] men involved so they all received the
[23:57] Holy Ghost 12 in the upper
[23:59] room but remember they were tutored by
[24:02] God himself the holy ghost or the son of
[24:04] man told them everything they needed to
[24:07] know during the time now a lot of things
[24:08] they didn't understand a lot of things
[24:10] they didn't
[24:11] believe come
[24:13] on where did them other 380 Brethren go
[24:17] that saw 500 of them saw him after his
[24:21] resurrection I mean come on let's just
[24:23] be let's just be
[24:25] honest we had brother Dale for 50
[24:27] something years
[24:29] if we us to walk in that door right
[24:30] there in human
[24:34] flesh post office can
[24:37] burn I shouldn't said that never
[24:41] sorry I'd never go to work a day in my
[24:43] life I'd hang around that guy cuz he got
[24:46] something and I want that
[24:48] something but he was seen a 500 people
[24:51] in that condition from Death to life
[24:53] again and 380 of them just went
[24:55] somewhere else 120 of them the only ones
[24:57] went in the upper room did what he
[24:59] said so guess what we got to do what he
[25:03] said do what he said don't worry about
[25:05] everything
[25:06] else so the Holy Ghost and speaking
[25:09] through Isaiah is talking about by his
[25:11] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[25:13] justify many he's the only one that can
[25:15] justify us we know that you've got to
[25:17] know that you cannot justify yourself
[25:20] God is the only one that can justify you
[25:22] so much to where you will not be
[25:24] accounted to that
[25:25] sin thank you Lord amen that you'll not
[25:29] ever be accounted to that sin that's why
[25:32] the blood of Jesus Christ eradicated sin
[25:35] if we'll just believe
[25:37] it those in the Old Testament they
[25:40] didn't receive the Holy Ghost like you
[25:41] and I
[25:43] did right they had an anointing that's
[25:46] right cuz the blood of bulls and goats
[25:49] they didn't have enough word to get
[25:50] their soul
[25:51] clean but when Jesus died he cleaned up
[25:55] Moses he cleaned up David he cleaned he
[25:58] took and oh come on somebody I just I
[26:01] just realized that he wiped their sate
[26:03] clean David's not a murderer no more
[26:06] David's not a hormonger no more Moses is
[26:10] not somebody that brother rown said took
[26:12] his own
[26:13] will
[26:15] no they're clean pure God just brought
[26:18] them right back up put their SE in their
[26:21] sins in God's forgetfulness never to be
[26:24] remembered again then boy you come up to
[26:27] now where you take a fifth seal Jew that
[26:28] don't even like Jesus now those people
[26:30] lived the life they wanted to know who
[26:33] the Messiah was Moses Isaiah all those
[26:35] different ones David Goliath I mean
[26:38] Samson they all had flaws but they were
[26:41] looking
[26:43] toward something happening to take care
[26:45] of all that right and it did but now
[26:49] we're looking at a Jesus Christ that now
[26:51] not only eradicated sin for the people
[26:53] that loved him he eradicated sin for the
[26:55] people don't like
[26:57] him amen
[26:59] fill Jew but he had to because he is the
[27:02] one that put them in that
[27:04] place that's to me that's a just and
[27:06] righteous
[27:07] God Amen he blinded him he blinded his
[27:11] own
[27:13] children to get me and you here he loved
[27:16] us so much he blinded and divorced his
[27:20] first
[27:22] wife
[27:24] hello he divorced his first wife Israel
[27:27] he said he did amen because they went
[27:29] whing but he had to do that and then
[27:31] blind their eyes so that you and I could
[27:33] come in and all the millions of bride
[27:36] that'll come up in that Resurrection
[27:38] every one of them come out from under
[27:42] that the fifth seal Jew if he hadn't
[27:44] blinded their eyes we would have never
[27:46] come so praise God for that to me
[27:49] talking about
[27:51] justification he was just
[27:53] enough not just enough he was just
[27:57] enough
[27:59] till he did it to him and he's the only
[28:02] one that can impart eternal life and he
[28:04] imparted eternal life to him because
[28:06] he's the one that made him do
[28:08] that ah I love God he's perfect in what
[28:11] he does and there's a fifth seal Jew
[28:13] there though to show me and you that we
[28:16] weren't looking for him
[28:18] either we were Blasphemous we were
[28:22] Sinners he came looking for
[28:26] me and his in his expressed listen to
[28:31] this his expressed job was to eradicate
[28:35] your sin yes
[28:37] sir that was his job you want to call
[28:39] God give God a job Jesus Christ had a
[28:43] job he had a job to where the father
[28:46] can't see your sins no more
[28:50] forever oh come on praise
[28:54] God that was his job to eradicate your
[28:58] sins and to look and to show me there's
[29:00] a just
[29:02] God listen the devil's not just he's not
[29:06] fair no you can't ever say God's not
[29:09] can't ever say God's not
[29:11] fair God's fair you and I are not but
[29:14] God's Fair Satan is not he hates being
[29:17] fair cuz listen he hates
[29:21] truth but just but a righteous judge is
[29:24] the only one that can tell the truth
[29:26] right cuz he Justus
[29:29] and guess what he done I've told you
[29:30] before he justified you yes he did when
[29:34] he took your sins away oh please don't
[29:36] ever forget Calvary don't ever forget
[29:38] what God did for us we can talk about
[29:40] message all we want to but just do not
[29:42] forget just simple salvation that God's
[29:45] picked you before the foundation of the
[29:50] world hid you from Satan in the womb of
[29:53] your mama oh come on somebody but when
[29:56] you came out you came in Satan's world
[29:58] but he knew by
[30:01] predestination so he just put somebody
[30:04] with you he put your special angel with
[30:05] you to walk you through life as brother
[30:08] Joe we were talking about if God saw you
[30:10] at a certain place there's no way
[30:12] Satan's going to get you till that no
[30:14] way cuz remember God can't change his
[30:19] mind I hope we catch
[30:22] that yeah we were predestinated we were
[30:24] predetermined but in God's mind not mine
[30:26] and yours that's right
[30:28] we have peanut brains as daddy always
[30:30] said we have peanut brains God don't
[30:33] have
[30:35] that so he walked us right through this
[30:38] journey to get us to his point point to
[30:41] give us eternal life amen oh thank God
[30:44] everything you went through everything
[30:47] your life took a turn this way or this
[30:49] way or that way or that way yes sir was
[30:51] ordained of God that's right you
[30:54] responded to the call oh Lord that's
[30:57] what makes you different than the
[30:59] world and you submitted yourself to the
[31:03] call see Satan had a call sorry Lucifer
[31:07] had a
[31:08] call to be the anointed chair to be the
[31:10] song leader to be the one that says hey
[31:12] you do this God said you say you take
[31:14] care of that brother Ram called him
[31:16] God's right-hand man right-hand man boy
[31:19] you got a right-and man that's the guy
[31:21] that helped you well until iniquity was
[31:23] found in his heart until he wanted to be
[31:25] up here instead of down
[31:26] here I don't know how I got off on that
[31:29] but praise the Lord John 17 that's just
[31:33] where Jesus is coming to the end of his
[31:34] life right he says sanctify them through
[31:39] thy truth yes Thy word is
[31:41] truth as thou has sent me into the world
[31:45] I'm just going to throw them out there
[31:46] and just let them just just flounder
[31:48] around like a fish out of water that's
[31:50] not what he said he said as thou has
[31:52] sent me into the world even so have I
[31:55] also sent them into the world amen and
[31:59] he what he equipped us and them for a
[32:03] job that's
[32:04] right remember brother Brown said if God
[32:06] sends somebody he don't just send them
[32:08] he goes in
[32:10] them do we really believe
[32:13] that he went in US yes took us through
[32:16] the journey through all of our faults
[32:18] and failures and ideas he was right
[32:20] there yes sir he's an long time God yes
[32:25] he
[32:25] is that's right he sa you didn't get
[32:29] saved two days before God saw you get
[32:31] saved you got saved the day you got
[32:33] tired of being tired oh
[32:36] Lord sick and tired of getting sick and
[32:39] tired oh praise

[32:46] you don't never lose it that's right you
[32:49] know there's a you can't lose Sal your
[32:51] salvation but you can lose the joy of it
[32:54] as we sang the song restoring un to me
[32:55] the joy brother Brown said d David
[32:58] didn't lose his salvation he lost the
[32:59] joy of it we got to get back to get to
[33:01] the joy of that salvation amen sanctify
[33:05] them to thy truth Thy word is truth as
[33:06] thou H has sent me into the world even
[33:07] so I send them into the world and for
[33:10] their
[33:11] sake Jesus is doing something for a
[33:14] group of
[33:15] people he has set himself aside so that
[33:18] you can be set
[33:20] aside right that's a a and for their
[33:23] sake I
[33:25] sanctify up come upon part part of the
[33:29] apart from the world that they also
[33:31] might be Sanctified through the truth
[33:33] see we can turn and look at the guy that
[33:36] is our justifier he's our sanctifier and
[33:38] he's our Holy Ghost filler one person
[33:40] Jesus Christ amen we ain't got to look
[33:43] over here and find another it's right
[33:44] there that one person amen talk to that
[33:47] one person talk to him talk to him like
[33:50] he's your
[33:52] friend neither pray I for these alone
[33:56] but for them in 20
[33:58] 24 September the
[34:00] 1st also which Shall Believe on me
[34:04] through their word hallelujah oh praise
[34:06] God John 20:21 then Jesus said to them
[34:09] peace be unto you as my father has sent
[34:11] me even so send I you and when he had
[34:14] said this he breathed on them and said
[34:17] unto them receive ye the Holy
[34:20] Ghost that's the same thing that's the
[34:23] same thing the Holy Ghost did in the
[34:26] Garden of Eden as we were talking about
[34:27] this morning same thing same guy same
[34:33] breath made Adam a Son of God remember
[34:36] he's the only one in the in the Old
[34:37] Testament but he wasn't born and then
[34:39] given that he was given that at full
[34:41] birth so he couldn't be our
[34:43] brother he didn't have a belly
[34:46] button amen he he was born from a womb
[34:49] so Jesus Christ had to come and have get
[34:51] a have a belly button God had to have a
[34:53] belly button praise God he did he chose
[34:57] it that way
[34:58] cuz we look down we well we might can
[35:00] see ours I don't know if you can see it
[35:01] or not whosoever let's continue on
[35:03] whosoever sins you remit they are
[35:06] remitted unto them you see this you read
[35:09] this he has transferred that power to
[35:12] you and
[35:13] me whosoever sins you remit they are
[35:15] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[35:18] you retain they are retained you watch
[35:20] what you do with people you watch what
[35:22] you say about
[35:26] people then this is a quote where the
[35:29] they said in the Greek Lexicon that the
[35:30] only two times that word used is he
[35:33] breathed on Adam and he breathed on the
[35:36] people that before the upper
[35:39] room let me ask you a question they
[35:41] asked brother random a question why do
[35:43] you think God did that why do you think
[35:44] Jesus Christ did
[35:46] that he didn't have
[35:51] to right he didn't have to breathe on
[35:53] them for them to get the Holy Ghost cuz
[35:55] it was already a promise in the upper
[35:57] room it was already already promised
[35:58] that you go and be endued with power
[35:59] more
[36:03] High that's what happened in the
[36:06] beginning that's what he that's what
[36:08] they just the commentator said here if
[36:10] it happened in the beginning and man
[36:13] fell to get man back up he had to
[36:16] breathe on them and say receive ye the
[36:19] Holy Ghost that's why that's what I look
[36:21] at I mean if if if that was spoken then
[36:23] man fell then something's got to be
[36:25] spoken and it had to be the same guy
[36:27] that spoke spoke there that spoke here
[36:31] amen and for us to be raised back up
[36:34] right cuz remember that was the fall and
[36:37] we've been we're going to be what we're
[36:39] going to do away with the fall you and I
[36:41] in this end time are going to do away
[36:43] with the
[36:45] fall
[36:47] sir dear brother Brandon what's the
[36:49] difference between Jesus breathed on the
[36:50] disciples and said receive you the Holy
[36:52] Ghost when they had to go to the upper
[36:54] room to trry it was a promise he gave
[36:57] them breathed upon them his promise and
[36:59] said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a
[37:01] promise he was
[37:02] so you know that to receive that was so
[37:05] strange because nobody ever received it
[37:08] everybody with me Adam was the only one
[37:10] and he's
[37:12] gone so he actually walked them through
[37:16] the whole process before he left he was
[37:19] so gracious to say you're going to
[37:22] receive this go go on ter in Jerusalem
[37:25] but this is how you're going to get get
[37:28] it you're going to you're going to go to
[37:30] the upper
[37:32] room and eternal life is going to be
[37:34] breathed into your
[37:37] nostrils they went to the upper room to
[37:39] wait for the promise to be fulfilled the
[37:41] same thing is when we lay hands upon you
[37:43] to be healed then you go on about your
[37:45] business waiting for the promise to be
[37:49] fulfilled so the Holy Ghost there's
[37:51] always a
[37:53] promise and watch what um John the
[37:56] Baptist said John the Baptist said I
[37:58] indeed baptize you with water unto
[38:01] repentance but he that cometh after me
[38:03] is mightier than I who shoes I am not
[38:06] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[38:09] the Holy Ghost and with fire amen all
[38:12] right the Holy Ghost is a timy gentleman
[38:15] amen but there has to be a fire to burn
[38:18] the old you out
[38:22] firsten justification chop chops past
[38:24] sin sanctification drives unclean Spirit
[38:26] out God's trying to clean this mess
[38:28] up then he comes in with the Holy Ghost
[38:31] and burns all a fire that you will not
[38:34] ever be acquainted with until you get
[38:36] the Holy Ghost cuz he burns it out
[38:40] there's no
[38:41] smoke there's no literal
[38:45] fire he comes in and actually takes that
[38:48] old nature and takes it completely out
[38:50] of you oh praise God if you had never
[38:52] been born again you ought to try right
[38:54] am oh yeah we're going to fight that old
[38:57] nature whole time folks cuz remember the
[38:59] S Satan's still
[39:00] alive he's right here and he still got
[39:03] it in his
[39:04] hand God don't see it but Satan still
[39:07] got it right here and Everywhere You Go
[39:08] by he
[39:12] goes right well pray for me then if
[39:15] y'all don't say Amen pray for me because
[39:17] he does me he knows where I
[39:21] live Luke 24:49 said behold I send here
[39:25] A
[39:25] Promise upon you but tear you in the
[39:28] city of Jerusalem till you be endued
[39:29] with power from on high or till I sink
[39:33] in inside of you I'm not going to come
[39:35] just be with you I'm going to come and
[39:37] be in
[39:39] you so there's no message to the first
[39:41] age we we talked about that there was an
[39:43] outpouring of the Holy Ghost Peter was a
[39:46] spokesperson then what happened then
[39:50] they said how do we get saved and what
[39:51] does Peter say he says repent and be
[39:53] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[39:55] the remission of sins and what you
[39:57] received the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[39:58] what the promise here we go with the
[40:00] promise again the promise is to you and
[40:02] your children and to them that are far
[40:04] off even as many the Lord Our God shall
[40:06] call amen but then after all that they
[40:10] had there had to we we had to wait on a
[40:14] prophet to come a Divine reveal of the
[40:16] word Paul could take that Old Testament
[40:18] and make it sound like it's just for me
[40:20] and you and it
[40:21] is but he took that Old Testament that
[40:24] we looked at the law and the killings
[40:26] and the eye for an eye and the do this
[40:29] and don't do that and he took it and
[40:31] brought it right into the New Testament
[40:33] and he just made it more plain than ever
[40:35] before that's a Divine revealer of the
[40:38] word of God which means God spoke
[40:40] directly to Paul and Paul spoke spoke
[40:43] directly to you and
[40:44] me all right now I don't say William
[40:47] Seymour and and Peter that God didn't do
[40:49] the same but he didn't do it in the
[40:51] scale that he did it because Paul was
[40:54] the first church age messenger he was in
[40:56] the Bible brother Bram was the last
[40:58] Church age messenger Malachi 4 so he's
[41:01] in the Bible all right so being in the
[41:03] Bible they're Divine revealers of the
[41:05] word of God we had to have that we had
[41:08] to have that in this age that's right a
[41:11] Divine revealer now brother Brandon
[41:13] wasn't
[41:14] Divine come on he was human we were
[41:17] talking downstairs listen if God hadn't
[41:19] protected that man he'd have been a
[41:21] murderer that's right that's right and
[41:24] tried to commit suicide twice right amen
[41:26] I don't
[41:27] I listen he didn't say he sat down on a
[41:30] rock and thought about
[41:32] it he put the gun to his head pulled the
[41:35] trigger nothing happened amen he was up
[41:39] a pole 20,000 volts he took his glove
[41:41] off and reached up to get it God wasn't
[41:44] protecting William brandham he was
[41:46] protecting the gift that brother Bram
[41:48] fit to and he had to come to that mature
[41:52] part and let's don't forget that he had
[41:55] a temper and he loaded Ed eight shells
[41:58] in a in a
[41:59] gun huh see Jesus platted robes that
[42:03] didn't kill anybody brother brandom
[42:06] loaded that gun and he was going to kill
[42:07] them boys remember he kept firing he
[42:10] another one in kept firing nothing
[42:12] fired what he'd have been a murderer
[42:13] he'd have killed every one of them
[42:15] kids well people don't like for you talk
[42:17] about that but you know what it just
[42:19] makes go brother Brown
[42:21] human it just means that you and I in
[42:24] our Humanity God can speak through us if
[42:27] just let him even through our flaws and
[42:30] through all the junk that we go
[42:33] through almost committed suicide
[42:37] twice he said he had
[42:40] complexes couldn't get rid of some
[42:43] things that's
[42:46] right well he was a prophet for the end
[42:49] time God use the man that's the only man
[42:52] he could use or either use somebody else
[42:55] that's the only man he could fit that to
[42:58] and he preserved that man until he got
[43:00] to that place till he was finished with
[43:02] him and then took him off scene
[43:04] everybody with me on that all right when
[43:07] God's when God's got a path for you to
[43:09] take when he's finished with that he's
[43:10] finished with it cuz remember he don't
[43:12] make no mistakes absolutely that's right
[43:15] now he may let you as he did Hezekiah
[43:19] give you 15 more
[43:20] years but remember Hezekiah was in bad
[43:24] shape for 15 years he should have went
[43:26] 15 years ago when God got ready to take
[43:31] him just be ready to go when God
[43:35] calls so brother Brown said no
[43:37] Messengers to the age because the Holy
[43:39] Ghost came himself in the fullness of
[43:40] the baptism so what's going to happen is
[43:42] is God's going to baptize these people
[43:46] with the Holy
[43:47] Ghost and he's going to restore the
[43:50] gifts to the church but he's not he's
[43:52] going to reform them in a part of the
[43:55] word
[43:57] that brother brandham is going to
[44:00] restore right one more time AUD the
[44:05] street they had flaws in their
[44:08] Doctrine God is not ever in a false
[44:11] Doctrine that's right he's not the
[44:13] author of it and he hates it remember I
[44:16] we went through that he hates nism he
[44:18] hates Jezebel religion he hates all that
[44:20] stuff he ha God hates that but he
[44:23] allowed it to happen to prove his point
[44:26] to prove who you you and I can make it
[44:29] through we all came out of that
[44:33] mass if you didn't come all out of that
[44:35] mess that I'm talking about that you
[44:36] were messed up anyway when you came
[44:41] out but that predestinated seed don't
[44:44] ask no questions it's thoroughly
[44:46] convinced that it's God moving according
[44:48] to the promise you okay in
[44:51] there
[44:54] okay for those you can't see you walked
[44:56] in the study she's got a cramp so just
[44:58] pray for a
[44:59] cramp a little further up the road
[45:01] really than Aza Street see brother
[45:03] brandham standing and and it is funny
[45:06] but it's not he's standing actually in
[45:08] the gap between the headstone and the
[45:14] babies and he's pulling them saying look
[45:17] you've got all this your bag is full of
[45:21] the gifts of God why are you not using
[45:24] them we got to get over here to the to
[45:27] The Headstone we got to get over here to
[45:29] the maturity part we still want to just
[45:32] feel good we still want to just speak in
[45:35] tongues we still want to just and
[45:38] brother Brandon was that's why it's
[45:39] called a pull God pulled him through all
[45:42] that he God pulled you through all that
[45:44] and he's pulling you to where he's
[45:46] pulling us up and out of here that's why
[45:48] that headstone is pulling us
[45:51] up praise God that God's in control of
[45:53] this thing and we're not amen thank you
[45:55] Lord amen a little further up a road
[45:58] really than Thea Street we should be the
[46:00] church should be up here I'm sure he
[46:02] went like this not down like this it
[46:05] started with weeping crying coming to
[46:06] God and it fell away fell way away and
[46:11] here's something up here that the church
[46:12] should be up to now what year was that
[46:14] that was
[46:17] 1962 um the seals hadn't opened yet but
[46:19] they getting ready to be open cuz that's
[46:21] in November the seals opened in March of
[46:23] 63 so he's feeling the pull amen be
[46:28] convinced then concerned be convinced
[46:32] listen brother brandham his message
[46:36] never shut the doors of the Pentecostal
[46:41] churches he never shut a door of the
[46:44] Baptist
[46:46] Church his his message never eradicated
[46:49] any Doctrine neither did
[46:52] Jesus come on cus just come right on out
[46:56] and did the same thing the next morning
[46:57] after they killed Jesus right they just
[47:00] kept right on after brother R got took
[47:01] off the scene they just kept right on
[47:03] making denominations right but there's a
[47:06] group of people inside of that listen
[47:09] folks this is the secret coming of the
[47:11] lord it's me and
[47:14] you it's not the denominations it's me
[47:17] and
[47:19] you we're working under the cover
[47:22] cover of the end time message yes sir
[47:25] sir kind of like a CO vert operation
[47:27] that God's doing not us but he's got us
[47:30] sitting everywhere all over the country
[47:33] in the world and the world's
[47:36] going well I think God may come this I
[47:39] well this I think it's this guy well I

[47:42] person well let's go follow this one we
[47:45] know where we're at we know what we got
[47:48] we just got to start using it we know
[47:51] who we are you got to realize that the
[47:53] prophet said who you are and what you're
[47:55] doing here
[47:57] you're here to defeat the
[48:03] Devil 1962 on the countdown brother Bram
[48:07] said did there come on a zza street
[48:08] where they left the ground and hit the
[48:10] air through the baptism of the Holy
[48:12] Ghost God took the church from an
[48:14] Earthbound Creed into a solo flight in
[48:16] the air solo flight all
[48:21] right you
[48:24] okay she's fine she's just resed
[48:28] okay just as the airplane come in the
[48:30] Holy Ghost came in behind it 1906 isza
[48:34] Street 1905 first fixed winded airplane
[48:37] God Don't Make Mistakes amen but now
[48:40] they did now listen they stayed there
[48:42] they love the airplane we all love the
[48:44] airplane we can fly all over the place
[48:46] with an airplane but if you really want
[48:48] to go out of space you can't do it in an
[48:50] airplane you got to get in a
[48:54] rocket ausa Street never seen those
[49:00] things listen that hasn't been since
[49:03] Christ what's he talking about his
[49:05] message the restoration of the gifts
[49:07] plus the restoration of the
[49:10] word isusa Street never seen those
[49:13] things that hasn't been since Christ was
[49:15] on Earth what's he what's he identifying
[49:17] the son of man Ministry was not at isusa
[49:21] Street
[49:23] hello but the son of man is through his
[49:26] message the son of man is going to
[49:27] appear now in the end time soza Street
[49:30] never seen those things all they saw the
[49:33] great outpouring of the Holy Ghost for
[49:35] three days they had service three days
[49:38] I'm talking about morning night morning
[49:40] night morning night they had three day
[49:43] full service one time and I guess they
[49:46] got so tired they had to quit but wow
[49:50] but it was the power of God and the
[49:51] outpouring the Holy Ghost it wasn't
[49:54] false the Holy Ghost is not false
[49:57] it did what it's supposed to do at that
[49:59] point in time with the people daddy
[50:02] Seymour param all the different ones
[50:04] they were there because God put them
[50:06] there that's
[50:07] right now watch brother R said and
[50:10] Christ is on earth now in the form of
[50:13] the Holy Spirit watch in its
[50:17] fullness trying to get
[50:21] you away from these Earthbound things to
[50:25] lift you up into his
[50:27] presence now we've been a long time
[50:29] since Thea Street we've been a long time
[50:31] since brother br's message we should be
[50:33] as astronauts flying in the atmosphere
[50:36] out of the
[50:39] atmosphere now the the Pentecostals now
[50:41] look one of his eyes was out a colored
[50:43] brother who really started the
[50:45] Pentecostal message in California old
[50:47] isza Street he was laughed at and
[50:49] because he was a negro he was made fun
[50:51] of but he brought a message for that
[50:54] age God works in strength strange ways
[50:57] doesn't he just a little body a fellow
[50:59] could hardly sign his own name but the
[51:02] Lord had revealed to him that this was
[51:03] the age for the restoration of these
[51:06] gifts now not the restoration of the
[51:08] word restoration of the
[51:10] gifts the word restoration had to come
[51:13] by a word
[51:14] Prophet William Seymour was not a word
[51:17] prophet he was used of
[51:20] God but he was not a restorer he was
[51:22] still into the Reformation right huh yes
[51:27] that's why it took brother Brandon it
[51:28] took a prophet to come as he said a
[51:30] prophetic
[51:33] prophet and that's what we're under yes
[51:37] there's no other Messenger to this
[51:39] age this is the going home age there's
[51:42] no messenger coming this is it that's
[51:46] why brother R's message when he got
[51:47] killed in 1965 that's it you ain't going
[51:51] to hear no more you're not going to hear
[51:53] something past what his message is amen
[51:56] amen we got to get right with what he's
[51:58] already
[51:59] said
[52:00] amen all right now look no matter what
[52:03] said it come so in other words a part of
[52:06] whatever they were God was going to
[52:08] bring the Holy Ghost Ona Street in 1906
[52:12] but everybody got in the atmosphere of
[52:14] it and seen it was that age you ought to
[52:16] read that book you ought to get that
[52:18] book and read it uh it's zusa Street I
[52:20] think it's 100e celebration book but
[52:23] they had all they and they had the the
[52:25] sweetness of the Lord during that whole
[52:27] time they had people from all over the
[52:29] world blacks and Whit sit together that
[52:32] was the whole thing the people on the
[52:33] outside was going look param was a
[52:36] segregationist he wouldn't let the black
[52:38] people in remember he let he let Daddy
[52:41] Seymour sit on the outside and listen to
[52:43] his classes cuz they couldn't segregate
[52:46] but see God had to move that out of the
[52:47] way cuz he don't like that segregation
[52:49] like that so he brought a oneeyed black
[52:51] man he give him the Holy Ghost set him
[52:54] right down in the middle of the church
[52:55] and said listen to what that guy's got
[52:57] to say oh what a mighty God we
[52:59] serve God's going to have his way it
[53:01] doesn't
[53:03] matter but everybody got in the
[53:05] atmosphere of it seen it was that age
[53:07] and seen God vindicate that those people
[53:10] could speak with tongues and so forth it
[53:13] happened but then when he went and
[53:15] pinned it down to this is the only
[53:17] evidence that killed
[53:19] it remember brother briam says one time
[53:21] they cabbage down on that
[53:24] gifts and God moved on then they started
[53:29] separating and making denominations one
[53:31] coming on the cloud coming on the
[53:33] bush but Malachi 4 was given to do two
[53:37] things as we were talking
[53:39] about excuse me a matured bride went in
[53:43] the ground come back on the zza street
[53:45] as untrained babies so there had to be
[53:47] somebody to
[53:50] turn you know what turn means turn
[53:53] turn and sit them in another Direction
[53:57] all right in the heart of the children
[53:59] of the fathers lest I come and smite the
[54:00] Earth with the curse brother R came with
[54:02] those Pentecostal babies and was to
[54:05] bring them to maturity but they didn't
[54:07] none of them
[54:08] come oh they came to a place you and I
[54:11] listen once brother Brown passed away
[54:13] that's when the mature group showed
[54:15] up because they started pulling out and
[54:18] making churches Full Gospel Spoken Word
[54:22] Church I mean we were started in 1971
[54:25] that wasn't but six years after he
[54:26] passed
[54:28] away yeah amen we were actually one of
[54:31] the churches that was like this is a
[54:34] message
[54:35] church cuz a lot of them stayed in
[54:38] Pentecost amen hello I'm telling you we
[54:41] saw it back there a lot of them stayed
[54:43] in Pentecost or tried to bring Pentecost
[54:45] with them
[54:46] yeah the experience yes the denomination
[54:50] no
[54:52] amen so we were the Pentecostal babes
[54:55] you and I listen if you're born again
[54:57] you had a Pentecostal experience yes
[55:00] right come on you had a Pentecostal
[55:04] experience if you didn't you're not born
[55:06] again man you don't how to speak in
[55:10] tongues we see that
[55:12] now but they thought so much of it till
[55:16] they built a denomination on it well
[55:17] once they build a denomination like I
[55:19] said before there's not ever been a
[55:20] denomination been done away with as far
[55:22] as I know they just build more I'm going
[55:25] to split from this and I'm I'm going to
[55:26] split from that well now you see the
[55:27] same thing in the master
[55:29] churches amen
[55:32] yeah there's there's there's Full Gospel
[55:35] Tabernacles and then there's the first
[55:37] church of the Full Gospel Tabernacles
[55:39] then there's a second Church of the Full
[55:41] Gospel Tabernacles they just keep
[55:42] branching off right come on they do I'm
[55:47] sorry but remember Satan wants to get in
[55:51] this he's already got
[55:53] that let me give you one more
[55:57] shocker Satan wants this to fail more
[56:01] than he wants that to fail out there cuz
[56:04] if this fails he's got the whole world
[56:06] that's what he wants he that's his
[56:08] problem he wants everything God's got
[56:11] and be
[56:13] God I just want to be his
[56:16] bride I'll take the promise I'll take
[56:18] what he's got I'll take the Holy Ghost
[56:21] and I'll let him mature me up the statue
[56:23] of perfect man that's that's enough for
[56:25] me I don't want to go ahead of my
[56:27] headship amen cuz when we do we assert
[56:31] oursel above that means we know more
[56:32] than God does and i d a person I
[56:35] know being led by the spirits of God
[56:39] spirit of God being led of the Holy
[56:41] Spirit 195 this 1956 we read this this
[56:43] morning we'll start talking about the
[56:45] gifts here in just a
[56:46] second he was in a he was in a vision
[56:50] all right and there was a later string a
[56:53] nice eighth of an inch tape real nice he
[56:55] said you can't can't teach Pentecostal
[56:57] babies Supernatural things now if you
[57:00] were a Pentecostal listening to that
[57:02] you'd think man you're crazy all we see
[57:05] is Supernatural gifts but they didn't
[57:07] have the word to back it
[57:09] up they didn't have the word to back it
[57:12] up they just had the gifts and that's it
[57:15] now look he said look said you'll cause
[57:18] carnal impersonations and brother R
[57:20] didn't cause it Satan caused it amen
[57:23] remember blood in the hands oil on the
[57:25] head and all that stuff
[57:26] that was all carnal comparisons that's
[57:29] it or
[57:30] impersonations yeah that's right he said
[57:32] you'll cause remember the remember the
[57:34] angel of the Lord said look quit
[57:35] explaining
[57:37] it just put it out there and if they
[57:40] believe it they believe it if they don't
[57:42] they don't but brother B just kept
[57:44] explaining everything he
[57:46] did he got rebuked for
[57:49] that now 1964 the seals of
[57:52] open how many have told you the angel of
[57:54] the Lord in that pillar fired it met me
[57:56] up there told me to be sincere if I'd be
[57:59] sincere it would come to pass I would
[58:01] know the very secret of the heart how
[58:02] many remembers that he said it would be
[58:05] that way now how many remembers that he
[58:07] promised that it would continue
[58:10] on and not long ago for a vision he
[58:13] promised about that pull of that line
[58:16] said you can't teach Pentecostal babies
[58:18] Supernatural things and when I made the
[58:21] third pull he said now don't tell
[58:22] anybody about this in other words quit
[58:24] explaining it
[58:27] we'll get into the polls when we get
[58:28] into brother R's Ministry and when I
[58:31] made the third poll he said now don't
[58:32] tell nobody about this you've been
[58:34] trying to explain that
[58:36] other don't tell nobody about this this
[58:39] is the great and final pull that's why
[58:41] folks it's just to
[58:44] us amen it's not to anybody else I'm
[58:47] sorry that's why God said through a
[58:49] prophet it's not for our Pentecostal
[58:52] babies it's for mature people that can
[58:54] eat strong meat amen as Paul said I've
[58:57] come to you and I've give you baby food
[59:01] but in time now you need to eat strong
[59:03] meat Corinthians there he is again right
[59:05] here 1 Corinthians 12 he goes back again
[59:08] to them tries to get them straighten up
[59:10] and they do to a
[59:13] degree so let's read this 1 Corinthians
[59:18] 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand
[59:21] now this is Paul telling the Corinthians
[59:24] right that no man speaking by the spirit
[59:27] of God call us Jesus a cursed all right
[59:31] and then that no man can say that Jesus
[59:34] is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost so
[59:37] he's putting the holy ghost in the in in
[59:39] in the Forefront got to have the Holy
[59:42] Ghost right you got to have the Holy
[59:44] Ghost through Jesus Christ not these
[59:45] gifts that's right right come on Amen
[59:49] for in the Forefront you got to have the
[59:51] Holy Ghost to understand what these
[59:53] gifts are if not you're going to be just
[59:55] like Pentecost you're going to try
[59:56] you're going to shoot toward the target
[59:58] but you're never going to hit
[1:00:01] it now there are diversities of gifts
[1:00:06] but the Same Spirit right right and
[1:00:09] there are differences of
[1:00:11] administrations but the same
[1:00:13] lord and there are diversities of
[1:00:16] operations we have song leaders we have
[1:00:19] musicians we have responsive reading we
[1:00:21] have pastors we have Elders we have
[1:00:23] deacons that's the operation of the
[1:00:26] church yes right but it's the same God
[1:00:28] which worketh all in all yes but the
[1:00:32] manifestation of the spirit now watch to
[1:00:34] manifest the spirit this is what it's
[1:00:36] going to be to man the manifestation of
[1:00:39] the spirit is given to every man to
[1:00:41] profit with all all right is everybody
[1:00:44] with me wake up this is the only service
[1:00:46] now that you you you don't need to sleep
[1:00:48] through because you ain't got to sleep
[1:00:49] through no
[1:00:51] more unless you just do it real early in
[1:00:53] the morning bless your heart
[1:00:57] for to one now not one person all
[1:01:02] right he's dividing it up for to one is
[1:01:06] given by the spirit the word of wisdom
[1:01:10] that's the first one of the nine
[1:01:12] spiritual gifts is wisdom and we'll
[1:01:15] break them down later on don't have time
[1:01:17] we have
[1:01:19] communion to another the word of
[1:01:22] knowledge now look what it what's his
[1:01:23] emphasis by The Same Spirit
[1:01:27] Amen to another Faith we're not even got
[1:01:30] the tongues
[1:01:31] yet wisdom knowledge
[1:01:36] Faith to another the gifts of healing
[1:01:39] now do you see that word I I I'm the
[1:01:41] kind of guy that I'm like Brother
[1:01:42] Richard Wilson if one word got us out of
[1:01:44] the garden one word wrong not going to
[1:01:46] get us back in so I look at every word
[1:01:49] like brother randam he said look he said
[1:01:51] I want y'all to know he said he said
[1:01:53] Rapture in faith lies in
[1:01:58] not
[1:01:59] on this is on this is words written on a
[1:02:03] page but what's inside of that is what's
[1:02:05] going to Rapture us I like what Brother
[1:02:08] Richard Wilson we were talking about
[1:02:09] something talking about different
[1:02:10] doctrines he said brother R said a
[1:02:13] lot because every major Doctrine that's
[1:02:15] false came from Brother bradam quote so
[1:02:19] we got to get the essence of the message
[1:02:20] we got to get what God's saying the
[1:02:22] spirit saying to the church all right
[1:02:23] everybody with me all right so the
[1:02:26] Rapture in faith lies in we got to dig
[1:02:28] in to get it right on the surface it'll
[1:02:31] kill you Paul said the letter kill it
[1:02:33] yes but the spirit giveth life we're
[1:02:36] fixing to eat Jesus's
[1:02:38] flesh and drink his blood according to
[1:02:41] the
[1:02:42] Bible I'm sorry according to what he
[1:02:46] said right amen quote got a quote for it
[1:02:52] but we know what we dig in Paul dug in
[1:02:55] for us and told told us what to
[1:02:57] do praise the Lord let's dig into what
[1:03:00] the spirit says to the church not
[1:03:03] exactly the A's and these and buts all
[1:03:05] right all right now look the gifts of
[1:03:08] healing why do he say gifts why is Gifts
[1:03:10] of healing plural there's two
[1:03:13] kinds there's instant
[1:03:16] healing right and then there's Divine
[1:03:19] Healing which takes a length of time so
[1:03:21] there are Gifts of healing by The Same
[1:03:23] Spirit to another the working of mirales
[1:03:26] we haven't got to tongues and
[1:03:28] interpretations
[1:03:31] yet I've seen a miracle in my life you
[1:03:34] seen a miracle in your life me standing
[1:03:37] right here is a miracle in my
[1:03:40] life but I've seen other Miracles yes
[1:03:43] sir things that were strange that
[1:03:44] shouldn't have come to pass they did
[1:03:46] that's a
[1:03:48] miracle see we think well sometimes we
[1:03:51] think we don't have gifts in the church
[1:03:52] because we a't spoken tongues or
[1:03:54] prophesied we a got to that
[1:03:57] yet to another
[1:04:01] prophecy to another Discerning of
[1:04:05] spirits amen uh we're not there tongues
[1:04:09] yet no but we're fixing to
[1:04:12] be the last two is the one they major on
[1:04:17] I say they I say people that look for
[1:04:18] gifts in a
[1:04:19] church to another many kinds of tongues
[1:04:24] to another the interpretation of
[1:04:27] tongues amen wow so that's the end of it
[1:04:31] but all these worketh that one and the
[1:04:34] selfsame spirit dividing to every man
[1:04:39] severly as he will in other words God
[1:04:41] gives a gift out severly as he will all
[1:04:43] right remember he said brother bam said
[1:04:45] he God could use some get one sister
[1:04:47] raise her up speak in tongue somebody
[1:04:49] else um interpret and never use them
[1:04:52] again right but it would be of God and
[1:04:55] it would be something that was in the
[1:04:56] church amen so God's Sovereign when he
[1:04:59] does that but what we have to do is we
[1:05:01] have to make oursel
[1:05:03] available cuz here's the problem I'm
[1:05:05] going to read it in just a minute why
[1:05:06] did we get
[1:05:08] gifts why is there gifts given in the
[1:05:12] body of
[1:05:13] Christ all right for as the body is one
[1:05:18] now watch for the body is one and hath
[1:05:20] many members right now watch though
[1:05:23] Paul's going to reverse that in a minute
[1:05:25] and all the members of that one body
[1:05:27] being many are one body so also is
[1:05:31] Christ for by one Spirit are we all
[1:05:34] baptized into one body whether we be jew
[1:05:36] or Gentile whether we Bond or free and
[1:05:39] have all to drink into one Spirit now
[1:05:41] watch for the body is not one
[1:05:45] member but many amen we got to see the
[1:05:50] the diversity of gifts there's one
[1:05:54] Giver unless Satan gets involved but
[1:05:56] there's one Giver that spirit is a
[1:05:58] capital S so we know that's the holy
[1:06:00] spirit Spirit of God if we have these
[1:06:03] things working we've got one giver and
[1:06:05] we've got many gifts given to each one
[1:06:07] of us all right so
[1:06:11] why why do we have gifts we had talked
[1:06:14] about them in a long long time why do we
[1:06:16] have
[1:06:18] gifts you ready brother R 1964 Jesus on
[1:06:21] the authority of the
[1:06:22] word now this is the truth of God
[1:06:26] that's the truth anything contrary to
[1:06:29] that is not truth but what that is to
[1:06:32] the Nations to the people he's talking
[1:06:34] about the Plan of Salvation but to the
[1:06:36] individual now watch this watch how he
[1:06:38] word this but to the
[1:06:41] individual then something after God
[1:06:44] sending his word this way and ministers
[1:06:46] to preach it he sent to the church
[1:06:48] Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues
[1:06:51] interpretation of tongues that's all for
[1:06:54] the edifying or the keeping
[1:06:57] clean of the
[1:06:59] church bringing the church
[1:07:03] together but what is it watch what he
[1:07:05] says separating out what separating out
[1:07:07] the
[1:07:08] sin amen
[1:07:11] watch 1960 what it takes to overcome all
[1:07:16] unbelief first is Apostles prophets
[1:07:18] teachers evangelist pastors these five
[1:07:20] god-given gifts are in the church so
[1:07:22] each of you people who has a Godly
[1:07:23] Pastor has a gift from God in your
[1:07:25] church Church a Shepherd pastor means a
[1:07:27] Shepherd to watch over the flock to
[1:07:28] teach them the word of God then these
[1:07:30] other nine different spiritual gifts now
[1:07:32] he's on the spiritual nine gifts we just
[1:07:34] talked about should be operated in the
[1:07:36] church to keep the church
[1:07:41] clean like ananas and
[1:07:44] Safara now brother R tell I'm not I
[1:07:46] didn't bring it but you know brother Ram
[1:07:48] said that would come back into the
[1:07:49] church and you know what happened
[1:07:51] right right ananas and Safar was a
[1:07:55] husband of wife
[1:07:56] team and they conspired to hold back a
[1:08:00] little bit of
[1:08:01] money but tell the body that that's all
[1:08:04] they had
[1:08:05] amen seemed pretty seemed pretty
[1:08:11] Innocent but that's not what God told
[1:08:13] him to
[1:08:16] do I I was thinking yesterday on this
[1:08:19] you know what they did they held back
[1:08:21] some tithe
[1:08:28] that's what it was it was the gain on
[1:08:29] what they
[1:08:31] sold they said I've got 50,000 they got
[1:08:34] 60 that's what they said I mean might
[1:08:37] amount of money but that's what they did
[1:08:38] and they conspired in their home to tell
[1:08:41] the same story cuz he told it she he
[1:08:45] died and she comes in and she tells him
[1:08:47] the exact same
[1:08:49] story and remember what happened Peter
[1:08:51] said you didn't lie to me he said you
[1:08:54] lied to the Holy Ghost right we must be
[1:08:57] careful what we
[1:08:59] say cuz there is an aniz and a fire time
[1:09:02] coming again that if we don't keep the
[1:09:04] church clean God's going to keep it
[1:09:06] clean not trying to scare you but I just
[1:09:09] praise God bring it we're here we need
[1:09:12] to get out of here this is what we need
[1:09:13] to get out of here cuz that's what he
[1:09:14] said watch like ananas and safire and so
[1:09:17] forth the spirit of God rise up call
[1:09:20] somebody out and tell them they're
[1:09:21] living
[1:09:23] wrong wow we get embarrassed when we
[1:09:25] holler at somebody this says call them
[1:09:28] out in the
[1:09:31] sanctuary tell them they're living wrong
[1:09:33] and rebuke that sin openly that's what
[1:09:36] the holy spirit is in the church for to
[1:09:38] keep the church clean look look and
[1:09:41] ready for the coming of the lord we
[1:09:44] believe that now then these other gifts
[1:09:47] coming to the church now after the
[1:09:49] pastor then there's evangelist and then
[1:09:50] there's teachers and then there's the
[1:09:52] prophets cuz that's to perfect the
[1:09:54] Saints amen the gifts won't do
[1:09:57] it come on the gifts won't perfect the
[1:09:59] Saints Apostles Prophet pastors the word
[1:10:02] is what perfects us
[1:10:03] yes and then there's Apostles and all
[1:10:06] these things working together with the
[1:10:10] gifts right keeps the church
[1:10:13] perfected and clean and ready for the
[1:10:16] coming of the Lord amen convinced and
[1:10:19] concern
[1:10:21] 1962 if you believe this to be this a
[1:10:23] prayer line if you believe this to be
[1:10:25] the spirit of God then it's condemning
[1:10:27] you that's right and how you going to be
[1:10:30] condemned the guilty of the least is
[1:10:33] guilty of the whole you know to do
[1:10:36] better somebody said as I made a remark
[1:10:39] last night someone said to me brother
[1:10:40] random why don't you leave off them
[1:10:42] women leave off them men quit doing that
[1:10:44] said you're people thinks you're a
[1:10:46] prophet he said I'm no Prophet the
[1:10:49] person said well people claim you to be
[1:10:50] though why don't you teach them how to
[1:10:52] receive spiritual gifts I said how can I
[1:10:55] teach them algebra when they don't even
[1:10:57] know their
[1:10:59] ABCs that's the Pentecostal babies he's
[1:11:02] fighting
[1:11:03] with they don't have common
[1:11:07] decency I'm reading what he said they
[1:11:10] don't have common decency enough to
[1:11:13] clean themselves up and act like
[1:11:16] Christians how you going to tell them
[1:11:18] spiritual things about Heavenly things
[1:11:20] that's right let the Pentecostal church
[1:11:23] I bet you where's this preach that
[1:11:27] Tabernacle no tempy Arizona probably to
[1:11:30] a bunch of Pentecostal right let the
[1:11:33] Pentecostal Church straighten itself out
[1:11:35] get right with God and I'll prove to you
[1:11:37] that the Holy Ghost will come right in
[1:11:38] they thought they already had it
[1:11:42] am while this the church will be so full
[1:11:45] of the power of the Holy Ghost there
[1:11:47] can't be one member do one sin now
[1:11:51] wow the Holy Ghost will call it out like
[1:11:54] ananas in of fire right but you can't do
[1:11:57] it when you won't even take your
[1:11:59] kindergarten
[1:12:01] training amen grow up he's telling them
[1:12:04] grow up quit being babies I'm I've
[1:12:06] taught you maturity for all these years
[1:12:08] and you're still acting like a
[1:12:11] baby I'm just reading what the brother
[1:12:13] Brown said 1963 the world falling apart
[1:12:17] we wonder today why the gifts and things
[1:12:19] are not in the church operating the way
[1:12:21] they should while the gifts are put in
[1:12:23] the church to separate and take sin out
[1:12:26] to keep the church clean it's God's
[1:12:29] toxin that's given to the church it's
[1:12:32] God also his disinfectant in other words
[1:12:36] that he puts into the church to kill out
[1:12:38] all the
[1:12:44] parasites that tear up the
[1:12:47] church and God prais his church over
[1:12:49] with his word and that keeps all the
[1:12:52] termites out you know so the church can
[1:12:54] grow a PL
[1:12:55] and God knows what it takes to do it
[1:13:00] amen finish right here get ready for
[1:13:03] communion 1 Corinthians
[1:13:08] 13:8 kind of correlates with Hebrews
[1:13:11] 138 charity never fails now that word we
[1:13:16] know that word's Agape anywhere you seek
[1:13:18] charity right there you look in the
[1:13:19] Greek that's Agape agape love not F love
[1:13:22] agape
[1:13:23] love charity never fail fath but whether
[1:13:26] they be prophecies they'll
[1:13:29] fail whether they be tongues they will
[1:13:33] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:13:36] shall vanish
[1:13:38] away for we know in part and we prophesy
[1:13:42] in part all right
[1:13:45] but when that which is perfect is
[1:13:50] come now Paul's going to tell you right
[1:13:52] here he's looking at it but he can't see
[1:13:54] it
[1:13:56] yeah come on he's looking at it but he
[1:13:59] can't see it I'll tell watch but when
[1:14:01] that which is perfect has
[1:14:03] come the cleaning up of the
[1:14:07] church then that which is in part shall
[1:14:10] be done
[1:14:11] away when I was a child I spake as a
[1:14:14] child I understood as a child it's not
[1:14:16] it's not a problem being a child it's
[1:14:18] staying one I thought as a child but
[1:14:20] when I became a man I put away the
[1:14:22] things I used to think amen right amen
[1:14:26] for now we see through a glass look
[1:14:28] Darkly so he's looking at with his
[1:14:30] spiritual eye but remember now he's in
[1:14:33] the lion age l o n he's not in the eagle
[1:14:37] age right he's in the lion age he's got
[1:14:40] a lot of power but he can't see very far
[1:14:41] over the grass but he knows in his
[1:14:44] Spirit though that there's a power
[1:14:46] coming that he hadn't even seen
[1:14:49] before for now we see through a glass
[1:14:52] Darkly but then face to face face now I
[1:14:56] know in part but then shall I know even
[1:14:59] as I am known in other words he knows
[1:15:01] part what's going on but he ain't going
[1:15:03] to exactly know what's going on until he
[1:15:04] comes back here
[1:15:06] amen and now abideth faith hope and
[1:15:10] charity these three but the greatest of
[1:15:13] these is agapy
[1:15:16] love agap love break out in the church
[1:15:19] you'll hear you'll see the gifts oh well
[1:15:21] hear them but you'll see the gifts
[1:15:23] you'll see the gifts operate in the
[1:15:24] church
[1:15:25] when we have love one for the
[1:15:27] other right and then what's going to
[1:15:30] happen is though once we declare that
[1:15:32] it's when God's going to start cleaning
[1:15:34] the church
[1:15:35] up and I don't say we're not clean but
[1:15:38] I'm saying the gifts are given to the
[1:15:39] church to keep us clean so we must be we
[1:15:42] we go through
[1:15:44] Seasons am well pray for
[1:15:46] me I'm sorry y'all come sometimes you
[1:15:49] look at me like pray for me I go through
[1:15:52] Seasons ups and downs ins and outs
[1:15:56] valleys

[1:16:03] humps it don't say get on the hump with
[1:16:05] God it says get on the mountain with God
[1:16:08] but we go through these things but it's
[1:16:11] to keep us clean to keep us to where God
[1:16:15] can God's not going to dwell in an
[1:16:17] unclean vessel
[1:16:19] right how can a clean thing come out of
[1:16:22] a dirty
[1:16:25] right how can a well of water bring
[1:16:29] bitter and bring clean it can't we got
[1:16:33] to get rid of all this
[1:16:35] stuff the Paul said this
[1:16:38] weight we i g HT this weight that so
[1:16:42] easily he said besets us that we can run

[1:20:10] told us to do 2,000 years ago and he
[1:20:12] said do this till I come and when he
[1:20:15] does that he can't break his promise can
[1:20:17] he that's what he promised us that we
[1:20:21] would come to a
[1:20:22] place to where wouldn't even have to lay
[1:20:25] hands on the
[1:20:26] sick but it's still in the
[1:20:28] Bible but it come a time when we come
[1:20:30] into as the prophet of God said speaking
[1:20:35] condition what a mighty God we
[1:20:38] serve let's read our communion scripture
[1:20:42] 1 Corinthians 11: 23 through 34 all
[1:20:45] right for I have received of the Lord
[1:20:47] that which I delivered unto you that the
[1:20:49] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:20:51] was betrayed took bread when he had
[1:20:53] given thanks he break it saying take eat
[1:20:55] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:20:58] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:21:01] same manner also he took the cup and
[1:21:03] when he had s saying this cup is the New
[1:21:05] Testament remember the testator had to
[1:21:07] die to bring a new testament in is the
[1:21:10] New Testament in my blood this do ye as
[1:21:12] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:21:15] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:21:17] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:21:18] Lord's death till he comes
[1:21:22] but wherefore whosoever shall eat eat
[1:21:24] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:21:26] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:21:28] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:21:30] examine himself that's why we T just for
[1:21:33] a moment examine yourself God is there
[1:21:35] anything in my life and if I need to go

[1:21:44] get that straight all right get it
[1:21:47] straight take your communion get it
[1:21:49] straight but let a man examine himself
[1:21:51] and so let him eat of the bread and
[1:21:53] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:21:55] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:21:57] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:22:00] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:22:02] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:22:05] if we would judge ourselves we should
[1:22:07] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:22:10] are chasing of the Lord that we should
[1:22:11] not be condemned with the world listen
[1:22:14] if you're born again you'll never be
[1:22:16] judged with the
[1:22:18] world oh praise God you'll never be
[1:22:21] judged with it this world is falling
[1:22:23] under judgment right
[1:22:26] now if you're born again you passed from
[1:22:29] death into life you passed this judgment
[1:22:32] that's coming to this earth CU God said
[1:22:35] it would amen but we've already been
[1:22:37] judged cuz there was one went to Calvary
[1:22:39] 2,000 years ago and this is the man
[1:22:41] right here that's getting ready to go
[1:22:42] and he's telling us what to
[1:22:44] do wherefore my brother when you eat
[1:22:46] together Brethren when you come together
[1:22:48] to eat t one for another If any man
[1:22:51] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:22:53] not together and condemnation in the
[1:22:55] restro I said in order when I come if
[1:22:58] anybody don't know what that thir 34th
[1:23:00] verse means Paul would come to the
[1:23:02] Corinthians and they would just have
[1:23:03] like a feast and get drunk and eat
[1:23:06] mutton and eat all you know they just
[1:23:07] had like a regular dinner and was
[1:23:09] getting drunk at the Lord's
[1:23:11] table he said don't do that he said go
[1:23:13] eat at home this is not communion is not
[1:23:17] going downstairs and eating
[1:23:20] supper right it's a solemn thing it's
[1:23:23] done with bread that basically has no
[1:23:26] taste at all it's
[1:23:29] flat amen and the wine sometimes bitter
[1:23:33] so this is not going to be a meal that
[1:23:34] you're going to brag about and put in
[1:23:35] the paper come on but that's what they
[1:23:39] were doing and he said don't do that and
[1:23:41] I'll correct I'll do more for you when I
[1:23:42] come back because he did have to come
[1:23:44] back in second Corinthians and talk to
[1:23:46] him again but not about the communion he
[1:23:48] was the one that see there's Paul that
[1:23:51] was not there on that night Peter James
[1:23:54] John they were all
[1:23:56] there Paul was not
[1:23:59] there but God through the Holy Ghost
[1:24:02] through a Divine revealer of the word
[1:24:05] called Paul set that thing in order God
[1:24:08] knows what he's
[1:24:09] doing he does not miss
[1:24:13] anything Bible said he took bread and
[1:24:15] blessed it dear heavenly father Lord
[1:24:17] this bread has been made with holy hands
[1:24:20] Lord not going to be held over tomorrow
[1:24:22] it's going to be taken and burnt Lord so
[1:24:24] that the new word will come Lord and
[1:24:26] this new wine Lord that we're going to
[1:24:28] partake to Lord give a stimulation of
[1:24:30] Revelation father I pray that you'd
[1:24:32] bless each one be be with the ones that
[1:24:34] are sick that couldn't be here today
[1:24:35] Lord I pray that you'd protect them just
[1:24:38] Comfort them Lord and be with them Lord
[1:24:40] in Jesus name
[1:24:49] amen yeah you know even when they had
[1:24:51] the Passover the children of Israel
[1:24:55] that lamb was just roasted it wasn't it
[1:24:58] didn't have spices on it it was just a
[1:25:00] roasted piece of meat and it the Bible
[1:25:03] tells us they that God told them to eat
[1:25:06] bitter herbs with it not sweet good
[1:25:09] stuff that like I said you right home to
[1:25:11] Mama about no bitter herbs put your
[1:25:14] shoes
[1:25:16] on huh he said because we're getting out
[1:25:19] of here or you're getting out of here I
[1:25:22] don't want you to be fat and comfortable
[1:25:24] in sitting in your lounge chair hello he
[1:25:27] said I want you to have your staff in
[1:25:28] your hand I want you to eat this it's
[1:25:31] ain't going to be a meal you'll like but
[1:25:34] it's going to be a symbolic meal that is
[1:25:37] going to get you out of here why because
[1:25:40] remember the word of God pretty
[1:25:44] sharp pretty
[1:25:46] powerful but it's got the most
[1:25:48] stimulation to Revelation you'll ever
[1:25:49] know in your entire life Google ain't
[1:25:52] got nothing on God
[1:25:55] nothing at
[1:25:57] all he knew Google before there was a
[1:26:04] Google
[1:26:10] amen dear heavenly father Lord this wine
[1:26:12] has been made for one purpose Lord and
[1:26:15] that's for us Lord to partake of it as
[1:26:18] you said Lord to eat this bread and
[1:26:21] drink this cup Lord and I pray that Lord
[1:26:23] will
[1:26:25] remember you when we turned this cup up
[1:26:27] that you went to Calvary and
[1:26:30] bled they cut you up like hamburger meat
[1:26:33] the prophet said you were
[1:26:37] unrecognizable but Lord when you came
[1:26:39] out of that
[1:26:41] tomb didn't matter what you look like
[1:26:44] you said all power in Heaven and Earth
[1:26:46] has been given unto me so father you
[1:26:47] have the power now to change lives you
[1:26:51] have the power by the Holy Ghost to give
[1:26:53] us gifts and in the church Lord to keep
[1:26:56] us clean and to sanctify us for this
[1:26:58] journey that we're on Lord I pray father
[1:27:00] that we will remember you when we do
[1:27:02] this in Jesus name we pray
[1:27:07] amen come
[1:27:09] morning I'll
[1:27:11] walk by the
[1:27:15] river I'll rest neath the
[1:27:19] evergreen
[1:27:22] tree I'll carry
[1:27:25] my cross through the midnight oh what a
[1:27:29] wonderful time come
[1:27:32] morning there's
[1:27:34] glory for
[1:27:37] me sometimes I'm
[1:27:40] despised and rejected you sure will cuz
[1:27:44] he was and I question oh
[1:27:48] Father how
[1:27:52] long then I take one more look at Mount
[1:27:59] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:28:04] go on you know he hung there for three
[1:28:07] hours most horrible death you could you
[1:28:10] could you could you could have 3
[1:28:13] hours and stayed there long enough to
[1:28:16] say it's
[1:28:18] finished and then he
[1:28:21] died but that wasn't it brother Brown
[1:28:24] said when he said it's finished he said
[1:28:27] it wasn't all finished he meant it was
[1:28:30] finished on Earth for him to be here and
[1:28:33] he was going to go away but his work
[1:28:36] just started come back on the day of
[1:28:38] Pentecost 50 days
[1:28:40] later started right over again in a
[1:28:42] group of people a many membered body not
[1:28:46] just one
[1:28:47] body but you know jun's family you know
[1:28:51] talking about the hair and all I know
[1:28:52] some of you heard it before
[1:28:55] but to me it's a testimony to to the
[1:28:59] things that we go through and
[1:29:02] and don't lie to yourself we had fun in
[1:29:06] the
[1:29:10] world why because that was the prince of
[1:29:12] the world was in us
[1:29:15] right but we don't want that no more but
[1:29:18] it's a fight and a struggle Jesus knew
[1:29:21] that he said put your burdens on me
[1:29:25] yes give me your
[1:29:28] problems I'll take them to
[1:29:33] hell I'll take him to hell when I go
[1:29:36] down there and I'll kick him over in
[1:29:37] there and shut the
[1:29:40] door that's what Christ did for me I
[1:29:42] don't know about you but that's what God
[1:29:45] did for me he went to hell for me he
[1:29:47] died on the cross for 3 hours so what's
[1:29:49] the what's the um um the sisters with
[1:29:52] your hair and I know it tastes a long
[1:29:54] time cuz I'm with j and it takes a long
[1:29:55] time to fix your hair takes a long time
[1:29:57] to do these things you got
[1:30:01] enough
[1:30:04] okay but if he can hang there for three
[1:30:07] listen he didn't hang there listen to me
[1:30:10] he didn't hang there as
[1:30:12] God cuz God don't
[1:30:14] bleed amen God don't feel pain that's he
[1:30:19] hung there as the son of man yes he hung
[1:30:23] there and took every sin every sickness
[1:30:26] every disease he felt every stripe he
[1:30:30] wasn't just some Angelic being that he
[1:30:34] didn't feel nothing no he felt every bit
[1:30:36] of that pain he and I'm sure those Roman
[1:30:39] soldiers didn't just find a place to put
[1:30:42] the
[1:30:42] nails like they do in the Philippines
[1:30:45] they find a place in here to put the
[1:30:46] nails so it don't bother your attendant
[1:30:48] I don't believe they did that to Jesus I
[1:30:49] believe they took that old dirty Rusty
[1:30:51] Nail and they drove it in as far as they
[1:30:52] could as fast as they could
[1:30:54] but he took all that for
[1:30:57] us CU when he was on the
[1:30:59] cross I was on his mind let's
[1:31:13] take oh thank you Lord

[1:32:41] 17 and supper being ended the devil
[1:32:44] having now put in the heart of Judas
[1:32:45] this car Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:32:48] knowing that the father had given all
[1:32:49] things into his hand and that he was
[1:32:51] come from God and he went to God now he
[1:32:54] he's coming to a
[1:32:56] place to where he's got to know what
[1:32:58] he's
[1:33:00] doing
[1:33:01] right he's got it all now he's been on
[1:33:04] the mountain he went up there with Moses
[1:33:06] and Elijah remember brother Bram said
[1:33:07] Moses and Elijah told him about his
[1:33:09] second coming told him what was going to
[1:33:11] happen and all that stuff okay he rises
[1:33:13] from supper and laid aside His Garment
[1:33:15] and took a towel and gted himself and
[1:33:16] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:33:19] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:33:21] to wipe them with a towel where with he
[1:33:23] was girded
[1:33:24] then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter
[1:33:26] said unto himl Dost thou wash my feet
[1:33:29] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:33:31] do thou knowest not now in other words
[1:33:33] Peter you ain't got the Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost you're just a raw fisherman naked
[1:33:38] cussing fisherman boy that's a good one
[1:33:40] to put in there isin't it but that's him
[1:33:43] that's who Peter was couldn't sign his
[1:33:44] name made of
[1:33:46] X Jesus and answered and said what I do
[1:33:49] thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know
[1:33:52] hereafter
[1:33:54] Peter said unto him Thou shalt never
[1:33:55] wash my feet Jesus said if I wash thee
[1:33:57] not thou Hast no part with me Simon
[1:34:00] Peter said unto him Lord not only my
[1:34:02] feet but also my hands and my head Jesus
[1:34:06] said to him he that is washed needeth
[1:34:08] not saved to wash his feet but is clean
[1:34:10] everywh and you are clean but not all
[1:34:12] see that's another promise there at the
[1:34:15] day of Pentecost they got cleaned up but
[1:34:17] that one guy
[1:34:18] didn't for he knew who should betray him
[1:34:21] he knew that that um
[1:34:25] he was right there Judas was right there
[1:34:27] with him he washed judas's
[1:34:29] feet knowing he was the one who was
[1:34:32] going to get him
[1:34:33] killed that's the god that's a God he
[1:34:35] love he went to Calvary for
[1:34:38] Judas but Judas didn't make it he made a
[1:34:41] wrong choice for he knew who should
[1:34:43] betray him therefore he said you are not
[1:34:44] all
[1:34:46] clean so after that he washed their feet
[1:34:48] and taken His Garment was set down again
[1:34:50] he said know ye what I have done to you
[1:34:53] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:34:55] well for so I am if I he was showing
[1:35:01] headship all right if I then your Lord
[1:35:04] and Master have washed your feet you
[1:35:06] also ought to wash one another's feet
[1:35:08] for I have given you an example that you
[1:35:10] should do as I have done to you verely
[1:35:13] verely listen listen I say unto you the
[1:35:15] servant is not greater than his Lord we
[1:35:18] talked about that today when we standing

[1:35:22] servant we're serving
[1:35:25] you that's the way it should be the

[1:35:42] giving us an example of
[1:35:46] humility that you the creator of the
[1:35:48] world everything you touched you
[1:35:50] created but yet you took the things that
[1:35:53] you created Lord and you sat down and
[1:35:55] took the water and you washed the feet
[1:35:58] of every
[1:35:59] disciple and you dried them off and told
[1:36:01] them you turned around and sat down and
[1:36:03] said all right guys if I've done this to
[1:36:06] you your master and Lord then you should
[1:36:09] do it to each other Lord I pray that
[1:36:12] you'd give us a revelation of what this
[1:36:15] day is the meaning of the communion Lord
[1:36:18] that it'll be something that we can take
[1:36:20] and continue on with that we be servants
