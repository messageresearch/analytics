[4:48] few more services okay
[4:51] first Peter 1:22 seeing you how purified
[4:55] your souls and obeying the truth through
[4:57] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[5:00] Brethren see that you love one another
[5:02] with a pure heart fervently being born
[5:04] again not of corruptible seed but of
[5:08] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[5:11] liveth and abideth for ever now watch
[5:14] our thought tonight because you're being
[5:18] born again not of corruptible seed not
[5:24] of corruptible word right but of
[5:29] incorruptible then he tells you for
[5:31] certain what it is by the Word of God
[5:33] which liveth and abideth forever so keep
[5:36] that in your mind and we'll get to it in
[5:38] a minute and come to that point okay so
[5:41] let's go now to Ephesians 4 to try to
[5:48] pick up earth out verse 8 wherefore he
[5:52] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[5:55] captivity captive and gave gifts
[5:59] unto me and now what did he give he gave
[6:02] gifts unto men all right now we're gonna
[6:05] read in about three more verses what he
[6:07] gave so it should be understood all
[6:11] right now that he ascended what is it
[6:13] but that he also descended first into
[6:16] the door parts of the earth he that
[6:19] descended is the same also that ascended
[6:21] far above all heavens that he might fill
[6:24] all things and he gave that out here's
[6:28] the gifts and he gave some apostles and
[6:30] some prophets and some past evangelists
[6:33] and some pastors and teachers what far
[6:35] far the perfecting of the Saints for the
[6:39] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[6:41] the body of Christ
[6:43] now once till in other words it's got to
[6:46] be fulfil till we all come into the
[6:49] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[6:51] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[6:53] unto the measure of the stature of the
[6:56] fullness of Christ or the statue of a
[6:58] perfect man that we've been on for quite
[7:00] a lot all right now what's that we
[7:03] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[7:07] and fro and carried about with every
[7:08] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[7:11] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[7:13] in wait to deceive but speaking the
[7:16] truth in love may grow up into him in
[7:19] all things which is the head even Christ
[7:22] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[7:25] together and compacted in other words
[7:27] pressed in brought in tight by that
[7:30] whichever joint supplies according to
[7:33] the effectual working in the measure of
[7:34] every part make an increase of the body
[7:37] unto the edifying of itself in love you
[7:41] may be seated
[7:42] the Lord had two blessings to his word
[7:44] and we pray that you'll just settle in
[7:50] and think about what we're trying to
[7:53] bring we have been for quite a while
[7:56] Peter speaking on the weather comes the
[7:59] last one I was in their water goat but
[8:02] they're coming they're running say
[8:04] running so everybody got back I reckon
[8:07] there
[8:08] back so that's huh okay I get to take
[8:10] off for a week or two no but we've been
[8:16] talking for quite a while about the
[8:17] statue of a perfect man all right now
[8:20] the prophet of God said it was necessary
[8:23] that we have these virtues in the
[8:26] message you know faith virtue knowledge
[8:28] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[8:30] kindness and he covers dark we'd give it
[8:34] over and over and even the last one we
[8:37] were giving that he said that these
[8:41] people that would have these virtues
[8:43] would be the ones who would go in the
[8:44] rapture all right now so then it's
[8:49] necessary that we receive these things -
[8:53] and he said it there was no way in other
[8:55] words we can't if we don't attain unto
[8:59] the virtues then and why would God write
[9:01] it in the word what would be his purpose
[9:04] so it's in there to show us what we have
[9:07] need of to become settled sincere sealed
[9:13] in Christians who walk in the light of
[9:18] the word of God all right so we went
[9:21] through that and brother Branham on the
[9:23] statute firm and he said how faith had
[9:24] be born again and he said and then these
[9:27] things are the things that God expects
[9:30] to be added all right so we got up to
[9:34] that point of talking about faith the
[9:37] new birth all right bringing us to that
[9:39] point to where we start at okay now I
[9:42] kind of told you the other day that I
[9:44] was going to put a message in between I
[9:46] didn't realize it one that be about
[9:48] three or four but that's normal for me
[9:51] so when I tell you I'm gonna preach one
[9:53] you might we'll get ready for three so
[9:54] that's alright too but we said we was
[9:58] going to place a little point into work
[10:02] that we would get an understanding of
[10:05] these things all right we read in Peter
[10:09] we've read it over and over being born
[10:11] again which means it's a process of
[10:14] going on it's not born again or being
[10:18] born again means something is in motion
[10:20] and
[10:21] moving and that's the way it is with a
[10:23] statue of a perfect man brother Brent
[10:25] said you were born again to faith and
[10:26] then these are the things he expects you
[10:29] to add to become a seasoned veteran
[10:33] Christian you know and told us even
[10:36] though that would be the necessity of
[10:38] taking us in the rapture all right now
[10:41] see then we come to that point to her
[10:45] that we studied over and over on the
[10:49] thoughts and wondering cause like I told
[10:52] you for 40 years or whatever brother
[10:56] mold in 1971 he preached a message
[11:00] called series message about 65 sermons
[11:04] on the stature of a perfect man all
[11:07] right and when he finished I asked him a
[11:10] simple question now we know we've we've
[11:13] got how these virtues it's not a point
[11:16] of whether we can have them or don't
[11:18] have them or who has number one it's
[11:20] required of us to have these virtues
[11:24] it's not something in the book to just
[11:26] lay there that we can do if we want to
[11:29] all right and that's been the basis of
[11:32] why we're here 50 years after the going
[11:35] of the Prophet because he's give us time
[11:37] to get the message understand the
[11:41] message walk in the light of the message
[11:44] but isn't it odd that after about 40
[11:48] years of moving along and doing pretty
[11:51] decently all at once you begin to see
[11:53] whole churches in the message just
[11:55] falling away preachers just 40 years 50
[11:58] years preaching and they've just fallen
[11:59] away see that's what we were talking
[12:02] about Sunday the to Bible says it must
[12:04] need to be a falling away
[12:06] well you can't fall off a house you get
[12:08] on it so then the message had to be
[12:12] presented and once it was presented see
[12:14] now the people are falling away from the
[12:17] truth all right but we're hammering hard
[12:20] to try to get us to see what it will
[12:22] take for us to go out of here and a
[12:24] change of these bodies all right see we
[12:29] can't just any daddle around and say
[12:31] well we just go into church we're being
[12:33] good
[12:34] what do you want brother Dale will we
[12:36] wear it services we we do everything we
[12:38] can do do this I want you to to wear
[12:43] that these virtues will come within you
[12:46] we read it where the Prophet said fill
[12:48] me up Lord that I may teach others we'll
[12:51] get back to that in a minute what to the
[12:53] fivefold ministry to bring these things
[12:56] into being all right
[12:58] now as I said I asked the question years
[13:02] ago how do I get these virtues well I
[13:06] mean I'm honest it was about 80 or 81
[13:11] that the Lord spoke to me about it that
[13:14] through the opening of the word
[13:16] directing it exactly to 327 church age
[13:20] book where this mentioned your Malachi 4
[13:22] Luke 17 30 will do two things first turn
[13:25] the hearts of the children back to the
[13:26] faith of the father's number to reveal
[13:29] the seven thunders which is the
[13:30] revelations contained in the seven seals
[13:32] and it'll be these divinely revealed
[13:34] mystery truths
[13:35] that's a verbatim quote and I'm bringing
[13:37] you read through 27 in the church age
[13:39] will be these divinely revealed mystery
[13:42] truths that literally turn us back well
[13:44] what's going to take us in the rapture I
[13:46] thought I thought we believe this
[13:48] message was what was going to change us
[13:51] I mean have I missed that somewhere is
[13:54] there some something I thought this
[13:56] message was to be the thing that would
[14:00] change us all right I mean if I'm wrong
[14:04] on that I surely have missed it a whole
[14:06] lot go what am i doing looking for
[14:08] something else oh no that's what
[14:10] everybody's doing now all right but we
[14:13] got up to the point of talking about the
[14:15] new birth and I told you I'd inject this
[14:17] message into this because how do we get
[14:22] these virtues if they're required and
[14:27] according to the Prophet read the
[14:29] statute of perfect men's day they're
[14:31] required required for a rapture I didn't
[14:35] say that he did think it's going to take
[14:40] these things to bring us to that
[14:41] position well right now how do we get
[14:44] them we've had the part
[14:47] the Prophet brought his message right
[14:50] we're not looking at us covering Sunday
[14:52] we're not looking for some other prophet
[14:54] to come or some other thing to happen or
[14:57] something to be here to bring it in some
[15:00] form of redemption because probably the
[15:04] brother branham preaches to the Future
[15:05] home I'm alright he preached us to the
[15:09] future home that was the hot development
[15:12] of the message that he brought to show
[15:15] us that that would be the finality of
[15:17] the eighth day all right
[15:20] so there's not anything about redemption
[15:22] to be brought if you think there is I'd
[15:26] like for you to tell me where it's at
[15:28] because see if you can be preached
[15:30] that's what I told a man at home my home
[15:33] are one day he was sitting there talking
[15:34] about it and and kind of making lights
[15:37] you know and so I just let him hang his
[15:40] ownself and he was talking about you
[15:42] know that said brother branham brought
[15:45] this message and swept off the
[15:48] foundation cleaned it off here said we
[15:52] are we're gonna build a church we're
[15:55] gonna build a temple I said well okay if
[16:00] that's what you think and that's what
[16:02] you believe but I said first off all the
[16:06] want to ask is one question did brother
[16:11] Branham preach the future home yes yeah
[16:13] I said well then there's not anything
[16:16] further beyond that so now how are you
[16:19] gonna build a temple that was all I
[16:23] asked me much I was finished you know
[16:25] not just asking me what was he gonna do
[16:28] I said what do you gonna do run around
[16:30] done priests just to these places are
[16:32] you gonna go back and preach over again
[16:34] he didn't like it but that's all right I
[16:37] didn't know problems with it I didn't
[16:40] throw him out of my house cause he
[16:42] differed with me I just I just asked him
[16:44] a simple question if the Prophet
[16:47] Priestess of the future huh then where
[16:49] are you going to do and according to
[16:52] that see in the future home everything
[16:54] would be all brought back to eternal
[16:56] life all right
[16:58] but see getting to the point now that we
[17:01] started Sunday in talking home we accept
[17:06] the fact
[17:07] now I'm using a way to approach this
[17:10] that you'll catch it in a minute what
[17:14] I'm doing so but is it true now that the
[17:21] Bible is the Word of God I mean is that
[17:27] true the Bible is the Word of God you go
[17:30] over here to this church tonight and ask
[17:32] them that question when they say yes sir
[17:34] that's right the Bible is the Word of
[17:37] God we've got the Word of God now you
[17:41] know and we've got the all of the things
[17:44] of that Word of God that we as us
[17:48] covered
[17:49] there Sunday we don't have to worry
[17:51] about it we just ask brother Branham
[17:54] yeah but he ain't here but his message
[17:57] is here right asking brother Branham
[18:03] what is the new birth across the mr.
[18:05] Gardner of the or do say the new birth
[18:07] is the birth of the word in you the word
[18:10] that you've received the revelation of
[18:11] Jesus Christ personally to you okay
[18:15] there's the answer from the Prophet
[18:17] brother Branham how are we predestinated
[18:20] that's a great mystery how are we
[18:22] predestinate he said we're predestinate
[18:25] about foreknowledge
[18:27] he said because foreknowledge is where
[18:31] it starts and then he can predetermine
[18:33] by his foreknowledge so we've got the
[18:37] truth uh-huh brother Branham we asked
[18:41] him question see that's I don't think he
[18:43] have any problems with that we're asking
[18:46] him to answer what he taught all right
[18:49] now see I believe he brought the message
[18:53] unto us I don't believe anybody else can
[18:58] come along and interpret that I've never
[19:03] looked for anybody to try to interpret
[19:04] what the Prophet said now to speak to me
[19:08] about it
[19:08] and put together the message to her that
[19:11] I
[19:12] can have an understanding is not
[19:14] interpreting in it
[19:16] oh yeah that's your West in now if it's
[19:18] right I just told you illustrated it run
[19:21] around and watch the new bird revelation
[19:22] of Jesus Christ personally I didn't try
[19:26] to interpret it he's the one that said
[19:27] you get what I'm talking about I know we
[19:31] won't finish tonight on this message
[19:33] because I got a lot of quotes that we
[19:39] could stay for quite a while and read
[19:41] alright but what I want to do is just
[19:44] get to point to you of one thing is the
[19:49] Bible the Word of God what is this
[19:56] message God's Word brought from the
[20:00] letter form by the Prophet which was the
[20:04] only one that could do it
[20:06] huh from the letter of the word this
[20:12] prophet we call brother Branham then you
[20:15] know Malachi 4 loops everything there
[20:17] that has been brought to our
[20:19] understanding and thank God for
[20:23] technology to word that you can just we
[20:27] used to search for weeks and months for
[20:29] try to find a quote that you could
[20:31] remember brother Branham said something
[20:33] and you'd listen to tape after tape
[20:35] after tape trying to find that right now
[20:38] it's just there it is well that put it
[20:44] in a great technical or technology and
[20:47] would you say a great age of scientific
[20:52] geniuses the word now does they're just
[20:56] nothing you know I mean they're they're
[21:00] doing all kind of things and and going
[21:02] into actually as brethren what broke up
[21:04] said broken into God's laboratory
[21:06] they're going into scientific things and
[21:09] toward is amazing alright because the
[21:14] Bible said the Bible said it would
[21:19] happen
[21:21] as in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[21:24] the coming of the Son of Man all right
[21:27] the Bible says things to us and tells us
[21:33] the very day in the hour that we're
[21:35] living we talked about it back under you
[21:40] know a few years ago when the towers
[21:42] failed in and read the scripture where
[21:44] it says when the powers fall putting it
[21:49] right in to the Bible of the age and the
[21:52] time that we're living well see then the
[21:58] point I'm getting at is the Bible true
[22:00] do we need another Bible I enjoy reading
[22:04] some of the other you know scriptures
[22:07] I've got a good many Bibles and I'll
[22:09] read them to compare the understanding
[22:12] to see if if they hell if the the
[22:16] translators held the same point because
[22:20] really technically you think about it
[22:22] the people who took the Bible and tried
[22:25] to translate it there are not people
[22:28] that were trying to interpret it that
[22:31] was not their purpose their purpose was
[22:34] not to interpret it to us it was to
[22:37] bring it down into language they break
[22:43] it down to where we can understand it
[22:45] you get one combo so that's why it's not
[22:48] called you know so and so's translation
[22:51] because he's not trying to interpret a
[22:54] real real person anyway he's not trying
[22:56] to interpret it he's trying to get it
[22:58] word-for-word all right
[23:02] and brother Branham said why we have the
[23:08] Bible he said two were even the the
[23:11] bucks and the hand is in the right place
[23:13] we know how to look for another Bible we
[23:17] don't have to try to figure out some
[23:18] other thing we just believe the Bible
[23:21] all right
[23:22] then believe in the Bible then that puts
[23:25] us in a marvelous situation with a
[23:27] horrible one
[23:31] because it will be made manifest what we
[23:38] believe right God's going to bring it
[23:44] out in this day brother Brad said it he
[23:51] was not want to try to prove that this
[23:53] Brad wouldn't fall like he's so he's
[23:58] putting it out to her that we can see
[24:01] he's it right or wrong
[24:04] alright now that shouldn't be settled as
[24:07] to where the Bible is right or wrong if
[24:10] it's not and you're still arguing over
[24:13] those points we haven't even got started
[24:14] yeah and we will be around here another
[24:17] 500 years let alone 50 you know so that
[24:21] ought to be settled to that point and if
[24:24] we can find something in that Bible then
[24:28] we can expect it to happen so we read
[24:34] Malachi 4 and we find that this
[24:39] messengers to do two things we find what
[24:42] is to do and how he's supposed to bring
[24:44] the word we read in Luke 17 30 even in
[24:47] the day when the Son of Man will be
[24:48] revealed we read revelations 10 7 as to
[24:53] those things and we quickly relate to
[24:56] the point that that has been fulfilled
[25:01] because it is part of the Word of God no
[25:08] no you followed me I ain't asking you to
[25:10] agree with me I don't never ask nobody
[25:12] to agree with me I ask you to listen and
[25:16] see whether or not it's truth alright so
[25:20] then is it true that the Word of God had
[25:23] been brought to us and the Prophet said
[25:25] pure and unadulterated I believe that so
[25:29] it's pole or NOC then it's been brought
[25:33] here and unadulterated from all mankind
[25:36] through that message as I've always told
[25:42] you and I've always believed it this way
[25:43] I don't believe brother Branham
[25:45] I believe he could make mistakes era as
[25:48] a human being and did well look the
[25:52] message he brought he's pure and
[25:58] unadulterated went way down brother
[26:01] they'll coach I got no here we're bread
[26:03] Ralph said to white all right it was the
[26:05] Holy Ghost
[26:05] yeah your honor let her around sat down
[26:15] but you know one thing that I like what
[26:17] he said you ever thought about the way
[26:22] he said it one time about those things
[26:26] he said you make sure you say what I say
[26:30] and what did he say he says because I'll
[26:34] be held responsible for that you believe
[26:39] he said dad now so if you're only able
[26:45] to have been able to get a hold of the
[26:49] message up to 1960 or 61 under when he
[26:53] gets into really he gets into the sealed
[26:56] so it'd be really 63 but just number you
[26:59] know 62 63 if that's all you had and you
[27:03] as a preacher and you had no contact
[27:06] with nobody to get any further
[27:08] information you know God wouldn't hold
[27:10] you responsible right because the
[27:17] Prophet would be responsible no now I've
[27:21] always told you - they ain't nobody
[27:23] remember how we brought it the other
[27:24] night Sunday the Prophet stands before
[27:28] nobody a prophet stands before God and
[27:34] God alone see there was nobody back
[27:39] there in the 50s and 60s
[27:42] even though Clarence Larkins said to
[27:44] what horse rider would Zoli was the
[27:46] Antichrist and that was probably her
[27:47] somewhere around the turn of the century
[27:49] the Yeti wasn't the Prophet see when the
[27:55] Prophet came on the scene then
[27:56] everything became responsible
[27:59] you ever noticed him you go back through
[28:02] time and where we are we we have the
[28:05] Pentecostals and then we have the
[28:07] Congregational whole into some different
[28:09] things or through that rule and we keep
[28:11] going back and the Baptist is well back
[28:13] here right you know what I'm talking
[28:17] about the Baptist's run turn of the
[28:19] century back on beyond Dyer you know
[28:22] what in about secret about 1959 or 60
[28:25] little run said the Baptist has just now
[28:27] become a denomination you know one
[28:32] because they just then turned him down
[28:36] that's what caused them to become a unit
[28:39] you explained it some other way when we
[28:40] know 100 years ago that became one did
[28:44] you see they wouldn't accountable then
[28:48] we're getting down to a fine line I said
[28:50] Sunday about this see the Prophet stands
[28:55] before nobody he goes straight to God
[28:57] all right now but anybody else from
[29:02] there on down there's got to stand in
[29:06] the place that we're all commanded to
[29:10] repent if we're not right
[29:11] see then to fivefold ministry has to
[29:18] answer to the Prophet come on
[29:27] the five whole ministries got an answer
[29:29] to the prophet in other words answer how
[29:31] you're gonna handle that like I've
[29:33] always tried to explain something well
[29:36] how was it there in the Bible that Paul
[29:39] could call doom on Phillips's and how
[29:42] many Asst you don't study your Bible
[29:48] Paul you remember that the two guys it
[29:51] was teaching that the resurrection was
[29:53] priced and Paul called him in and you
[29:56] know what did he have a right to do that
[30:01] because they were teaching what he
[30:04] taught Paul was teaching the very thing
[30:07] that they were teaching at the
[30:09] resurrection read your Bible Paul
[30:11] teaching the resurrection
[30:12] pipes but Paul was teaching that the
[30:14] physical resurrection had not come to
[30:18] pass but a spiritual resurrection they
[30:21] were teaching a physical resurrection
[30:23] had come to Pais that's what I'm trying
[30:27] to get you to see how serious it is to
[30:29] be a minister it's not a hat you know
[30:33] it's not just a thing boy I tell you
[30:35] what I love being a minister huh
[30:37] no only quit three times a day yeah
[30:43] ain't no joke it's only three I try not
[30:46] to do it full-time but you see the
[30:57] message has been brought we know it's in
[31:00] the Bible right we know it is the Bible
[31:02] you're getting it the Bible the message
[31:06] that's the Bible all right now you and I
[31:10] are gonna be responsible for what we do
[31:12] that this Bible has been vindicated you
[31:19] know you say well brother Dale wait a
[31:20] minute this oh this old Bible that old
[31:22] King James Version yeah that was the one
[31:26] the Prophet you he ran out of the verse
[31:30] and drive sure but the the King James
[31:37] was the one he said did the ends and the
[31:39] butts was even in the right place well I
[31:40] can find where this go well go right
[31:42] ahead you're just running yourself crazy
[31:44] you're not getting what he says this age
[31:50] will be judged by the prophets message
[31:54] that was read right out of the King
[31:57] James to us all right
[32:02] so now is the message in the Bible is it
[32:10] the message is in the Bible the Bible is
[32:12] the master each other I mean we can we
[32:14] can say well those were the finest good
[32:16] the Bible is the message the message
[32:18] it's the Bible all right and see then
[32:22] we'll be judged by what we do with that
[32:25] but we'll be judged by what we do with
[32:29] that cause the Prophet will spoke of in
[32:34] the scriptures behold I send you Elijah
[32:44] the prophet you don't take that to be
[32:47] your own scripture written to you
[32:49] now if you don't you don't under you
[32:50] don't want the Bible I won't I want the
[32:53] one where the Prophet the vindication
[32:56] comes down to work that I can see Christ
[32:59] right in that word now do you believe
[33:05] that it's in the Bible that there's a no
[33:10] mother of revelation 17 with
[33:13] harlot daughters you believe that and
[33:17] you believe that those people will be
[33:19] judged by that Bible are you do you
[33:26] believe they'll be judged by that Bible
[33:28] all right well because their name is in
[33:31] the Bible the situation is in the Bible
[33:35] of them existing so they'll be judged by
[33:40] it so this Bible is going to do one of
[33:43] two things to you and I it's either
[33:46] gonna bind us and cast us out or it's
[33:51] gonna bind us and see us in then which
[33:55] one do you want it's gonna do one of the
[33:59] two because it is the Word of God
[34:05] now
[34:11] and like more do we need to bring as
[34:13] proof of of the Bible being true and how
[34:21] much more is it that if we can find
[34:22] ourselves in the Word of God what about
[34:29] it
[34:30] now if the Prophet was in the Word of
[34:33] God and he spoke of the bride would she
[34:39] not be part of the Word of God are you
[34:43] following me
[34:44] see now you see where I'm going see then
[34:51] all we got to do is find our place in
[34:55] the word is it true that brother Brennan
[35:00] said how you do you do it he said you
[35:02] don't read he was wounded for our
[35:03] transgression he said you read me James
[35:08] Colley was wounded and I talked about
[35:14] him being Christ I'm talking about him
[35:15] being wounded and sick and that puts him
[35:18] in the word are you getting it that puts
[35:22] him in the word I made him cry so to get
[35:24] all that puts him in the word all right
[35:27] now being in the word then he can say
[35:29] that he was wounded for James Colley he
[35:37] was bruised for James company and with
[35:40] his stripes James Colley is healed that
[35:42] puts him in the word right okay
[35:51] if you're getting the point of what I'm
[35:53] driving at is the fivefold ministry
[35:58] spoke of in the Word of God okay is it
[36:05] but now I'm asking you this question is
[36:11] it in the Word of God the same way the
[36:16] mother cough or is in the work is it
[36:23] part of the work the same as Malachi 4
[36:26] is part of the work see then that's why
[36:31] the Prophet would bring it
[36:33] 154 Church age book I'm getting these
[36:36] off a member from the head so if I miss
[36:39] it you know I think that's right
[36:41] what does he say talking about that it's
[36:46] not the person who comes predestinated
[36:50] eternally from God right it's the seed
[36:55] or word that right now it's not the
[37:00] person this person here this elements
[37:02] who we are
[37:03] the man we call William Branham the man
[37:05] Park its predestinated by God's
[37:09] foreknowledge but her brother said he
[37:11] knew what he would do and you he'd
[37:13] receive it and so he had it there for
[37:15] him so he's predestinated for me but the
[37:18] word that he broke goes all the way back
[37:21] to eternal life before the foundation of
[37:23] the world all right
[37:26] well I then why would it we not consider
[37:29] that the fivefold ministry said the word
[37:32] the same way because that's where we're
[37:35] not getting it the fivefold ministry is
[37:39] gifts from God to the church you know
[37:46] that deacon sometimes is of man
[37:54] okay see we're going over a few eyes you
[37:59] know that matthias took the place of
[38:03] Judas he's never mentioned the right
[38:10] tire where he was put in because man
[38:12] chose Matthias ever how you pronounce
[38:15] that if it's right
[38:16] what brother on say he said man chose
[38:18] matthäus he said God chose Paul he they
[38:24] were not to a voted on Matthias to put
[38:26] him back in but a wonderful point that
[38:30] they did do they didn't realize it and
[38:32] didn't know it and maybe you had never
[38:34] thought about it but there you got
[38:36] eleven apostles Judas has taken out had
[38:41] Paul been made to twelfth that would
[38:44] have been great and he was the one to be
[38:47] placed are supposed to have been look
[38:51] man put matthäus Matthias is 12 what's
[38:57] Paul 13 that's wonderful in the
[39:04] scriptures you realize in the original
[39:10] there was - Ben 13 there's 12 tribes and
[39:14] one the Levi number right come on trying
[39:19] to show you a little bit of something
[39:21] you'll think about it to find our place
[39:22] in the word and find out we're in that
[39:26] word and then maybe it'll help us that
[39:32] was originally - Ben 13 tribes not to
[39:35] 13th - being a tribe it was supposed to
[39:38] been 12 tribes and Levi would have been
[39:42] the metacenter the priests all right but
[39:50] when sin entered the picture they pulled
[39:52] out the man out of the center and he
[39:53] wound up with twelve tribes am i right
[39:58] you had to put this in the end of the
[40:01] place of that when you you remember two
[40:02] of them went off and
[40:05] c13 is right number you know when you
[40:09] get over you ever study this and the
[40:11] message you know that when we get on
[40:12] over to the millennium and the thing
[40:15] it'll be back to 13 just illustrating
[40:22] how perfect the Word of God he is if
[40:24] we'll just think about it it was always
[40:29] meant for that Levite to be the sinner
[40:33] he didn't have a tribe he had no
[40:36] inheritance have you read your Bible if
[40:40] you ain't going read it and Levite had
[40:43] no inheritance God was his inheritance
[40:50] but he was in the Word of God trying to
[40:53] get you to see are you in the Word of
[40:55] God
[40:58] alright so we know now for a certainty
[41:05] the to make secure of Malachi 4 was to
[41:09] do those two things 327 Church Angela he
[41:14] was to turn the hearts of the children
[41:16] back to the faith of the father right
[41:19] because John the Baptist turned them
[41:22] from the Old Testament word to the New
[41:25] Testament bringing forth the random was
[41:30] come to turn it back so that puts him in
[41:35] the word would that put you in I and
[41:37] that word to I like it when you get over
[41:41] in the scripture where he he told him
[41:44] and said let it be known that I turned
[41:47] her hearts back you remember that one
[41:51] but listen what are you getting -
[41:53] brother Dale if the prophet was
[41:56] predestined they did not listen to the
[41:58] wording it's not the person that's
[42:01] predestinated eternally are you women
[42:05] it's not the person predestinated
[42:06] eternally it's the word or seed in other
[42:10] words the word it's predestinated
[42:11] eternally see brother Branham then was
[42:15] predestinate by foreknowledge that God
[42:17] knew he picked that
[42:18] the nature of the man everything would
[42:20] be right but then what come to him with
[42:26] melikhaya for that's predestinate
[42:30] eternally from God oh those prophets
[42:40] were predestinated eternally what he
[42:44] called one of them which one was it he
[42:46] said I knew thee before the world and
[42:48] ordained you as a prophet Jeremiah what
[42:53] about him that prophet is God's
[43:00] mouthpiece to mankind no matter what age
[43:05] what's the talking about and even when
[43:08] brother Branham covers it you get on
[43:09] over to we're in the New Testament that
[43:11] you've got all of the Apostles within he
[43:14] speaks of AG of us being a prophet they
[43:19] chosen for that job those prophets were
[43:22] so chosen till if you go to masterpiece
[43:26] and listen to brother Branham you will
[43:28] see him telling you that the prophets
[43:31] built the body of the Lord Jesus because
[43:38] they were the word that built that body
[43:42] and John come to introduce the head and
[43:45] the head was Jesus Christ
[43:48] alright so those prophets had their part
[43:53] to build the body of Christ but what
[43:59] about the fivefold ministry can you
[44:05] follow the same line of a minister why
[44:12] is the minister has to have all the
[44:13] qualifications no my right any other
[44:21] fivefold ministry you've got to have
[44:23] those qualifications right or he can
[44:28] qualify for a ministry you've got how
[44:30] the
[44:31] qualification given the vertical
[44:32] priesthood it was perfect in line you
[44:39] see one that there's not a lot of
[44:40] fivefold ministry that are real genuine
[44:44] I'm number one to say that I don't have
[44:47] a problem there's a lot of preachers
[44:49] that call themself ministers I won't I'm
[44:53] not saying I ain't gonna listen to him
[44:55] I'm just saying angle make much
[44:56] arrangements well because they're off
[45:06] the word well who you what I move I'm me
[45:12] who are you that solves that problem we
[45:15] got all that straightened out ain't
[45:16] worth nothing you ain't Norton nothin
[45:17] either and there's no way in the world
[45:19] they ain't gonna give me no raise to
[45:20] preach on the fivefold ministry and I
[45:25] know when realize it's gonna make me go
[45:27] this way instead of that way well you
[45:30] know I done went this way because I know
[45:33] what a ministry is I've talked to
[45:38] ministers about their call to preach and
[45:40] walk away then God you either didn't
[45:45] call me that away or you didn't call
[45:47] them one one of us is misted yeah he
[45:55] followed you what a call to preach was
[45:58] called appreciate no rooster crowing up
[46:01] in a tree or a dream you have or a bad
[46:04] thing I come through the Baptist come on
[46:05] I come through the Baptist since you had
[46:07] the kids jump up when they hollered I'm
[46:09] called to preach I'm called to preach
[46:11] so what was it once you called it well
[46:12] I've had such bad luck well I didn't
[46:15] know bad luck called you to preach I
[46:19] didn't make light of them then but I
[46:21] thought about it that's why brother
[46:23] Allen said it this way he said you'll
[46:24] see scrapped needs of ministers and
[46:27] others piled along the way because they
[46:32] don't know what it is do you know what a
[46:37] the ministry is
[46:44] we just read that it was gifts given to
[46:52] man
[46:57] my phone ministry's gifts giving the man
[46:59] what's the profit come on
[47:07] Rafi there's a gift to mankind the
[47:12] fivefold ministry is a gift to mankind I
[47:16] didn't write the book you know what I
[47:20] mean the profits when it says he's one
[47:25] who said it and I read it to you there
[47:26] the other day what your pastors ordained
[47:32] and leads you through now what are you
[47:37] gonna do if you don't have one
[47:39] oh brother deal I got you there but a
[47:43] random it's my pastor you know he's
[47:47] going off the scene you can't you can't
[47:50] tell that ministers got to be some live
[47:55] kotas the gift now you know what I
[48:00] brought Sunday you that were here the
[48:03] fivefold ministry does not have a
[48:06] message we only carry the message the
[48:11] Prophet brought if we don't do it that
[48:15] way we're not in the ministry at all we
[48:18] don't have a message of our own the
[48:20] brain no we're supposed to bring what he
[48:24] said because according to the scriptures
[48:26] and according to the Prophet the
[48:33] fivefold ministry is for the perfecting
[48:36] of the site but do we believe it anyway
[48:42] is our dependency upon the fact of a God
[48:48] called gifts of a fivefold ministry and
[48:53] yours one's gonna slap a lot in the face
[48:55] it's missing out there cuz they're they
[48:57] listening you got a have a pastor
[49:04] I pastor a church you know what I've got
[49:10] a passenger ain't talking about this a
[49:14] brother Brendan's my pastor and then I'm
[49:17] the pastor of this no no because that
[49:19] parts didn't going on you can't do that
[49:23] I've got a live pastor your says wait
[49:32] there says Aaron Bob must be in the back
[49:35] room on the pole for us and there's
[49:38] brother Louise for ministers these are
[49:41] my pastors plus we don't hold it we've
[49:48] got all the ministry here you just my
[49:52] life at sea when you got him College no
[49:55] we're not in no way do we believe we got
[49:57] the fivefold ministry then you got to
[49:59] come here
[50:02] whatever Minister has got to have a
[50:04] pastor you believe a pastor has to pay
[50:15] tithe let it run said he's the first one
[50:18] that will that close enough well who do
[50:23] you pay your time soon here yeah yeah
[50:26] yeah and all that comes through this
[50:27] pulpit
[50:34] see my ties just telling you outward on
[50:39] the line my tie that comes to me I can't
[50:44] spend it on my own I can't take that I
[50:52] must give it to someone so I pay the
[50:58] preachers they come through we'll ask
[51:03] for an offering if it's a missionary etc
[51:06] right but if it's not a missionary or
[51:09] something special we don't pass the
[51:11] plate for a ministry that comes true
[51:14] I'll pay you because I got a plate I he
[51:24] says a little different what we think we
[51:26] think well who you paid I - I've had
[51:28] this said to me who do you pay ty -
[51:30] you're the preacher you can't pay it to
[51:33] yourself okay so I find somebody I can
[51:37] give it and many preachers don't say
[51:40] that
[51:41] no they're sitting in multi-million
[51:42] dollar buildings right and I ain't
[51:46] nothing to be nothing to me whatsoever
[51:52] well what about the fivefold ministry do
[51:57] you depend upon the fivefold ministry do
[52:04] you depend upon the fivefold ministry or
[52:10] you depend upon your own sail what is it
[52:16] if your pastor the Prophet said it
[52:19] ordained and lead you through then one
[52:21] wouldn't you not find your pastor why
[52:29] would you not want God's Way do you
[52:33] believe that he only read it to you some
[52:34] more
[52:35] I mean you want me to keep reading what
[52:37] he had to say you know here at one time
[52:46] of the message questions and answers'
[52:49] law having a shadow d9 we believe in
[52:52] church government and the government is
[52:53] ordained of the holy spirit in the Bible
[52:55] the pastor is always the head of the
[52:57] church the pastor is always that's God's
[53:02] elder in the organ and organization you
[53:05] have to come through the bishop you know
[53:06] we were done organization know the Bible
[53:11] there's no higher order in the Bible
[53:13] than the elder of the church just tell
[53:16] me where it's at
[53:17] there's no higher order in the Bible for
[53:20] the church than the elder which is the
[53:24] pastor he's the highest order of the
[53:29] Bible hear his voice in 1958 I'm
[53:39] persuaded that a lot of them don't know
[53:41] God and congregation and the
[53:45] congregation will never live any higher
[53:48] than its pastor they're bringing these
[53:55] up
[53:56] Pergamon church age which is 1960 that
[54:01] church ages so you talk about the hidden
[54:03] manna was a special revelation he said
[54:05] when he hidden manna dies brother
[54:06] Branham let's put him up there but come
[54:09] on right down this let's just get read
[54:11] what he said okay but the hidden manna
[54:14] was a special revelation because he had
[54:16] to teach the others see a little more
[54:18] knowledge of the scripture no that's
[54:21] what he had that he could teach other
[54:22] he's supposed to be is that right you'll
[54:25] never live no higher than your pastor
[54:27] you just remember that he and called
[54:30] he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he's
[54:35] the shepherd
[54:36] I like that if he's the Shepherd
[54:41] he's got to know where the mana is to
[54:44] feed the sheep now a little special
[54:46] watches super sign 1962 I can show you
[54:53] where God puts gifts and power in the
[54:56] church
[54:57] now hold on to that gifts God puts them
[55:01] in he talking about no speaking in
[55:04] tongues shouting the reason I listen I
[55:11] can show you where God puts gifts and
[55:13] power in the church I want somebody to
[55:15] put your finger on the scripture and
[55:17] show me where he took it out where he
[55:21] took it back from the church it's a
[55:27] super sign to the believer that we
[55:29] passed from death unto life because we
[55:31] feel that Holy Ghost Church I know what
[55:37] most people think
[55:43] they think a minister is a you call me
[55:52] when you're sick or you call me when you
[55:56] die you know what I mean you glad to
[56:02] have a fivefold ministry when you die
[56:04] gonna need somebody to bury that's not a
[56:08] joke that's true
[56:09] the point is what I'm saying is what do
[56:13] we need it all the time
[56:16] could it be one that we're not being
[56:19] could it be the reason we're here fifty
[56:23] years after the Prophet left is because
[56:25] the people are not putting their total
[56:27] confidence into the Prophet showing out
[56:31] to be pretty good right now
[56:33] in other words what I'm saying is going
[56:35] out to be pretty close call you see I'm
[56:37] just falling out every day leaving the
[56:39] message their dependence is not on it a
[56:43] lot that brought you into the message is
[56:47] no longer in the message what about the
[56:55] fivefold ministry it's the Bible right
[57:01] what did we read while ago about the
[57:03] fivefold ministry let's just read a few
[57:08] things wrote around them see
[57:15] than the massive statue of a perfect man
[57:17] number two if you want to start with it
[57:21] he said whether I maintain my family
[57:24] where I maintain with it
[57:26] let me maintain Christ's hope of glory
[57:30] build me up Lord into this let Christ be
[57:34] my head that work came through me on my
[57:38] foundation my faith is in him let virtue
[57:41] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[57:43] and brotherly kindness work in me O Lord
[57:45] is my prayer I don't care live or die
[57:49] sinker ground denomination or no
[57:52] denomination friend or no friend that
[57:55] that work in me let Christ virtue his
[57:57] knowledge Lord that I might be able to
[58:01] teach those for God has set in the
[58:07] church apostles prophets teachers
[58:11] pastors and evangelists all for the
[58:13] perfecting and bringing these virtues
[58:16] into it for the perfection of the coming
[58:23] of the Son of God
[58:31] or the perfecting of bringing these
[58:33] virtues into it yeah but I just take
[58:39] what the Prophet said I'm not showing me
[58:41] how you're gonna get any further because
[58:44] you just ended your own point he said
[58:48] the fivefold ministry is for the
[58:52] perfecting of the signs the Bible says
[58:55] it is now many quotes do you need let's
[59:04] see there's 13 direct quotes that says
[59:08] is for the purpose the perfecting of the
[59:11] body God is said in the church some
[59:14] apostles secondarily prophets gifts and
[59:16] so forth in the church for that for one
[59:18] purpose for the perfecting of the body
[59:20] how many more do you want there's 13
[59:23] there and all of these I'm not trying to
[59:26] be arrogant or hateful I'm trying to be
[59:28] truthful brother Branham says the
[59:31] fivefold ministry is for the perfect
[59:34] team and bringing these virtues into it
[59:36] well know how you're gonna get it
[59:38] without the fivefold ministry you're
[59:43] gonna have to buy some finds you another
[59:50] way to get the statue of perfect man
[59:51] without the fivefold ministry but I'd go
[59:58] straight to the Prophet go to the
[1:00:00] Prophet and watch the Prophet say you
[1:00:07] remember what I've always said when we
[1:00:10] started on the internet I knew we'd get
[1:00:11] questions in time and I've got a lot of
[1:00:14] questions that say brother Dale what is
[1:00:16] so-and-so mean I had brother Joe to
[1:00:19] write a thing I refuse to answer any
[1:00:24] questions on the Internet
[1:00:28] if you want to know anything go to your
[1:00:31] pastor now that's still on they're going
[1:00:35] and said if you don't have a pastor go
[1:00:39] to the Prophet
[1:00:42] that's always been on it why because
[1:00:45] look if brother Branham is right God has
[1:00:50] said in the church the Apostles the
[1:00:54] prophets of teachers evangelists fart of
[1:00:57] perfecting and bringing all these
[1:00:59] virtues into it how are you gonna get it
[1:01:01] without them if he's true see we don't
[1:01:12] think about what a ministry is let me
[1:01:17] get this real quick we don't think about
[1:01:20] what a minister I got him here we'll run
[1:01:23] around he said it's not you doing the
[1:01:25] preaching I mean you're one of them it's
[1:01:28] not you doing the preaching he said is
[1:01:30] God doing the preaching now there's a
[1:01:33] true minister will say brother Branham
[1:01:36] it's right on that but will we say the
[1:01:41] fivefold ministry is right
[1:01:47] what about it well brother Li just get
[1:01:51] it myself let show me where are you
[1:01:54] gonna go with it you say but you think
[1:02:02] that I'm being some kind of a sarcastic
[1:02:04] hateful thing trying to make you believe
[1:02:06] me
[1:02:12] if you ever got that in your mind just
[1:02:15] remember your own we walk out of a
[1:02:20] church in this message and I told my
[1:02:23] wife I said you can go to that church if
[1:02:28] you desire I will not go anymore
[1:02:31] those were the doctrinal issue over the
[1:02:34] new birth and they said I can't stand
[1:02:37] that but I said if you won't go there
[1:02:38] are you welcome to go and I walked out
[1:02:42] of the Baptist Church and walked out by
[1:02:44] myself because I didn't even tell my
[1:02:46] wife I was leaving she made up her own
[1:02:50] mind for her to follow to do I'm not
[1:02:56] trying to build any kind of a kingdom
[1:03:00] that ought to be proof of how long we've
[1:03:02] been here and what we've been doing and
[1:03:05] how we operated what we do as a church
[1:03:13] see I'm not trying to be I'm trying to
[1:03:17] just do what God says
[1:03:24] the Ephesians says that the fivefold
[1:03:27] ministry is guilty what is a gift
[1:03:33] what is it gift it's something given to
[1:03:38] you and if it's given to you to try to
[1:03:47] receive anything back it's not a gift
[1:03:53] something you've done or didn't do or
[1:03:55] whatever I'm glad you don't like it
[1:04:00] according to Romans the scripture says
[1:04:02] the gifts and calling of God are without
[1:04:09] repentance you don't repeat to get a
[1:04:12] gift now listen I've got them laying
[1:04:16] here quote after quote where there's a
[1:04:20] fivefold ministry but there's nine
[1:04:23] spiritual gifts are probably seen but
[1:04:26] now the nine spiritual gifts a gift and
[1:04:28] go from one to the other one you could
[1:04:31] speak in tongues you could see how to
[1:04:32] Camus you maybe never do that again he
[1:04:34] says he said because that's in the body
[1:04:40] but he said the fivefold ministry is
[1:04:43] gifts five offices you know thought
[1:04:55] about that how many times I tell you
[1:04:59] that life Sunday I'll remember I got him
[1:05:01] laying here
[1:05:02] he said that's five full minutes for his
[1:05:04] offices he said even deacons are
[1:05:10] man-made I said read your Bible matthäus
[1:05:16] was man-made never accounted for
[1:05:20] anything in the Bible they should have
[1:05:25] waited don't Paul
[1:05:29] no but listen church
[1:05:34] how about predestinated gifts you
[1:05:43] realize the gifts the fivefold ministry
[1:05:45] is predestinated now listen I'm gonna
[1:05:50] say something that I don't generally
[1:05:52] talked this way and I didn't have no
[1:05:55] plans for anybody else to be here none
[1:05:57] of my business I stopped I preached when
[1:05:59] I preach I don't try to make it hurt
[1:06:02] anybody
[1:06:03] or what to do I just do what I'm doing
[1:06:05] if you don't believe you got away fine
[1:06:07] with me but gifts it's not the person
[1:06:14] that comes to me that's Nate and
[1:06:16] eternally it's the word or seed now can
[1:06:21] you follow what I've been saying
[1:06:22] Malachi for is the word or seed of the
[1:06:27] Bible right that's why we don't have a
[1:06:31] message we branch are supposed to break
[1:06:34] down what the prophet has brought and
[1:06:38] deliver it to the people right is it not
[1:06:45] true that Jesus took bread and blessed
[1:06:47] it and then he didn't hand it to nobody
[1:06:50] he's in wait a minute he handed it to
[1:06:53] the Apostles he didn't fight it out
[1:06:58] itself he handed it to them all the way
[1:07:01] through the whole Bible you don't have
[1:07:03] to worry about it that's where I don't
[1:07:04] worry because I'm standing behind the
[1:07:07] word or predestinated gifts
[1:07:10] I believe brother Branham now listen
[1:07:13] listen one saying the gift that he had
[1:07:17] which was the fulfillment of the Word of
[1:07:21] God to fulfill melikhaya for Luke 1730
[1:07:26] revelation 2:10 7 and all of those
[1:07:29] scriptures was to be fulfilled by profit
[1:07:32] that was predestinated eternally from
[1:07:35] God and was going to take place it
[1:07:38] didn't make no difference who tried to
[1:07:40] stop it
[1:07:41] because if it's a predestinated gift you
[1:07:44] can't stop it oh you agree within the
[1:07:54] fivefold ministry as predestinated
[1:07:56] attorney not the person into sin brother
[1:08:00] branham wouldn't pretest flesh man
[1:08:02] brother branham was not predestinated
[1:08:04] eternally
[1:08:05] he's predestination from God by
[1:08:07] foreknowledge to come down to be the one
[1:08:09] that that would come through but to gift
[1:08:11] itself was a gift given to mankind to
[1:08:18] bring us the word what about the
[1:08:23] fivefold ministry if it's true the
[1:08:25] Prophet said the fivefold ministry is to
[1:08:28] break these things down earth - if
[1:08:32] that's true
[1:08:40] then Paul is riding Romans when he said
[1:08:43] he he gave some apostles he cashed on
[1:08:47] profits you didn't just get one ministry
[1:08:51] throw it out
[1:08:52] he gave a five fold ministry the gift
[1:08:58] itself was predestinated eternally from
[1:09:01] God come on I can read all night of
[1:09:05] unity if you've got a gift even a non
[1:09:11] spiritual gift
[1:09:13] Iori women if you even with a nine
[1:09:16] spiritual gift that's gifts in college
[1:09:18] or without repentance you didn't repent
[1:09:20] to get it and when the Bible says seek
[1:09:24] ye the most earnest gift that's not the
[1:09:27] fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry
[1:09:30] don't seek she is what she is gifts and
[1:09:38] calling her without you can seek those
[1:09:41] they said seek the most earnest gift but
[1:09:46] for the fivefold ministry I didn't call
[1:09:49] myself to preach may I illustrate a
[1:09:52] second all of you know the story some of
[1:09:58] you haven't but years ago Wade was doing
[1:10:02] good he could I've sent him down with
[1:10:06] the ministers of this message and he
[1:10:09] could talk pretty good and he's about to
[1:10:11] a thirteen years old but like all little
[1:10:14] boys he went out slid away went out in
[1:10:19] the world took a while to come back and
[1:10:23] stood in this pulpit declared it over
[1:10:25] and over and over that God had done told
[1:10:29] me he's coming by
[1:10:37] so let him tell you his story of how did
[1:10:43] he fault and run and done everything
[1:10:46] else one day God stopped him we had a
[1:10:51] little cabin up in the mountains we
[1:10:52] didn't have no landline phone and he was
[1:10:55] trying to get a hold of us and we were
[1:10:57] up there with her little cell phones and
[1:10:59] couldn't contact so he finally got back
[1:11:02] home
[1:11:03] then we got back home the phone was
[1:11:06] ringing off the hook
[1:11:06] daddy did I gotta talk to you okay I was
[1:11:17] just greening they've heard they didn't
[1:11:22] tell you the story how he thought he had
[1:11:23] a heart attack and forever sent to me
[1:11:25] Gil he did know what you see when he got
[1:11:32] where he couldn't find mom and daddy he
[1:11:36] goes outside at work and says Lord I
[1:11:39] can't find my Mama and Daddy to pray for
[1:11:42] me he said I guess it's not my daddy

[1:11:51] new birth got involved well all right I

[1:12:07] about what he now said what do you mean
[1:12:09] I said he's gonna be standing in the
[1:12:11] pulpit with me ministry you said you
[1:12:14] sure - I'm sure
[1:12:15] what I said we can't tell him now how
[1:12:20] many people would keep that most

[1:12:47] you don't worry about it you grin if not
[1:12:49] for the fact that you glad something

[1:14:42] don't tell all the story you know lives
[1:14:44] another boy involved because they was
[1:14:46] too in the Bible no it was too in the
[1:14:54] Bible the prodigal son went out and
[1:14:56] splurged and run it old route and not to

[1:15:02] are with him you don't never hear that

[1:15:17] big thing was doing but you know what I
[1:15:20] like
[1:15:21] did you see that's what Terrence had
[1:15:23] always been he just always been there
[1:15:26] you know what I like the daddy said one
[1:15:31] thing to the son and that solved the
[1:15:34] problem you remember what he said he

[1:15:44] that he went out did you study
[1:15:48] read your Bible you know what old
[1:15:53] brother got over his pouting spell and
[1:15:55] everything went pretty good gifts
[1:16:04] what about it
[1:16:07] God trained you all of you laughed
[1:16:09] usually 30 minutes right that way the
[1:16:13] Prophet said this for one sermon he said
[1:16:18] what about it is the fivefold ministry
[1:16:22] predestinated eternally from God he's in
[1:16:27] the word it's in the word well I don't
[1:16:35] believe you went up and that ain't got
[1:16:36] nothing do with it dumb donkey telling
[1:16:39] you the truth you got to believe the
[1:16:40] dumb don't give truth right see just
[1:16:47] don't worry about when we're brilliant
[1:16:48] we can't figure out what you are don't
[1:16:50] worry about it I've been that way all my
[1:16:51] life ain't never figured it out yet but
[1:16:59] I do understand on one time I know what
[1:17:02] this whole boys been through and I know
[1:17:05] if it wasn't a gift in his heart he
[1:17:09] would not be pastoring this church today
[1:17:18] the a gift is a gift God gave you a gift
[1:17:25] he's Minister brother he gave you a gift
[1:17:29] for whatever is needed some apostles
[1:17:31] some prophets some evangelists pastors
[1:17:34] different ministries

[1:17:43] to find your place there's your
[1:17:48] adoptions and things you know you
[1:17:50] remember Manasseh over in the cornfield
[1:17:52] and should have been over on the other
[1:17:53] side you know the story of adoptions and
[1:17:55] things the Prophet taught you don't read
[1:17:58] the book everybody's got to find their

[1:18:49] your ideas your my ideas
[1:18:52] don't worry about it
[1:18:54] see when you stand in the position God
[1:18:57] will honor that and make it I've seen
[1:19:02] the dead raised the sick healed things
[1:19:06] happenin ever form could be thought of
[1:19:11] as Oh sister Julie the only thing I've
[1:19:13] never seen was blinded eyes to open so
[1:19:16] we ain't worried about that God's taking
[1:19:17] care of that part he's once doing this
[1:19:20] he just raised right why do you worry if
[1:19:26] you know where you stand it I'm talking
[1:19:29] about a gift ain't talking about me
[1:19:32] ain't talking about no people ain't
[1:19:35] talking about brother branham that human
[1:19:39] element he was was a human being is it
[1:19:45] true that he said one night at a motel
[1:19:47] with a gun in his lap is that true what
[1:19:53] he said why didn't he just walk in the
[1:19:58] other room say God you take care of it
[1:19:59] I'm going to bed
[1:20:00] cause he was a human being that was that
[1:20:04] outside man right give some collars or
[1:20:13] without repentance you don't repent to
[1:20:16] get a gift that's not here
[1:20:17] it's either gift to your aunt guilty
[1:20:23] you've even got a gift or you don't have
[1:20:25] a gift that's just as simple as it is
[1:20:29] because it's without repentance you
[1:20:31] don't repent to get it
[1:20:32] but is the FIFO ministry that's the
[1:20:35] point of making will quit is the FIFO
[1:20:37] Ministry predestinated eternally from
[1:20:40] God if it is we have a wonderful
[1:20:45] wonderful God and Savior we're supplied
[1:20:50] all he has need of I don't mean this in
[1:20:54] derogatory form I mean it in the truth
[1:20:57] the prophet has passed on I say it I've
[1:21:03] always been that way the prophet has
[1:21:06] passed on if you're waiting on the
[1:21:08] prophet to come you're gonna have to
[1:21:10] have your dependence upon him to come so
[1:21:15] get prepared
[1:21:18] go get him in our plane ready now I'm
[1:21:22] not throwing off on nobody that's God's
[1:21:25] honest truth I've always told you where
[1:21:30] I stand we got 30 40 days after the
[1:21:33] resurrection brother Branham could
[1:21:36] preach all over the world 30 40 days but
[1:21:38] he don't need no airplane to fly
[1:21:48] a gift
[1:21:54] what did he mean when he said her when
[1:21:58] who it was a hope that was praying with
[1:22:02] Oprah emini which one which was the life
[1:22:05] hope the medium what is meant when she
[1:22:08] said lord I don't know whether to marry
[1:22:12] this guy or not come on is that what she
[1:22:16] is praying seriously was that what she
[1:22:19] was praying I don't know what to do he
[1:22:22] said I send you Elijah the Prophet oh
[1:22:28] I'll send you Malachi for Elijah the
[1:22:33] Prophet
[1:22:38] give or not to be played with you can
[1:22:48] believe this or not that's no problem
[1:22:49] with me I don't worry about it you can
[1:22:53] take a gift and sell ice cream to an
[1:22:57] Eskimo if you got a gift they may be
[1:23:05] hard for you to think about one is you
[1:23:08] can do it in the gift line of natural
[1:23:17] people you have people would give that
[1:23:19] is in the ministry I mean in the church
[1:23:24] and things you don't let falls on that
[1:23:26] and you got people there that can talk
[1:23:29] good they can do this they can do that
[1:23:32] you don't never watch something like
[1:23:33] that you don't never listen to some of
[1:23:36] these guys with their great processing
[1:23:39] fret what's that word to use
[1:23:41] presentations that they can just man
[1:23:44] they just make you till you know it's
[1:23:46] been told if they these people that
[1:23:48] could do that and they have you standing
[1:23:50] up shouting money money and they're
[1:23:52] stripping you have ever done they can
[1:23:53] get and you hollered money they got
[1:23:57] gifts you carpenters Tony really carry
[1:24:04] gifts for some reason they learned a
[1:24:09] little something different than most
[1:24:11] people as to how to do things and it
[1:24:17] goes haywire my brother Gary we were
[1:24:19] down there and he was looking at a while
[1:24:21] see he's looking at there I just stand
[1:24:25] out on life and go I knew what the
[1:24:27] mortal guy was going through how in the
[1:24:30] world I'm not going to get this thing
[1:24:32] changed
[1:24:35] and Julie shaking her head so she
[1:24:37] probably heard a lot of it what you know
[1:24:41] one day something went me some can't
[1:24:44] take evidential I'll put this on with
[1:24:46] you know Patel I'm do that Tony comes in
[1:24:48] Tony's a good one
[1:24:50] you don't know I know a lot about him if
[1:24:54] he lays the tile down on the floor don't
[1:24:56] like wet Lucy have taken to relay it but
[1:24:59] that's a part of a gift when he's
[1:25:02] finished unified to worry about it
[1:25:05] he gifts or marvelous things the gifts
[1:25:10] the same to give to play instruments to
[1:25:18] give to work on cars to do this
[1:25:20] this gives and that's time because God
[1:25:26] is the great gift to hand down to
[1:25:28] mankind what kind of world would it be
[1:25:30] with all carpenters right it's what I
[1:25:37] told you about Richard he took a motor
[1:25:39] apart one day up in the building dr.
[1:25:40] house I said we're gonna joke it sucker
[1:25:44] I said if I've me not doing that to you
[1:25:49] when I took that boat out I'd write down
[1:25:51] where that boat went back I said cuz
[1:25:54] that's the only way I'd get back
[1:25:57] he said now here we're doing it you know
[1:26:01] what one day got back getting it run
[1:26:03] coordinates I'm surprised me get rolling
[1:26:07] what still I'm trying to break it part
[1:26:12] over you okay
[1:26:13] everyone said that's all I got is a gift
[1:26:15] to break that spell say see savings bond
[1:26:17] in both of your minds or what I'm
[1:26:19] talking about
[1:26:19] of the fivefold ministry so we try to
[1:26:22] break it off okay you don't know I do
[1:26:24] that you just watch it
[1:26:27] what you see Church gifts are a
[1:26:30] wonderful thing
[1:26:35] but what about the giver instead of the
[1:26:37] gift you know there'll be a lot of
[1:26:44] people at the white throne be given the
[1:26:46] gift of eternal life
[1:26:48] right they'll be given the gift of
[1:26:53] eternal life with the bride will be
[1:26:58] sitting there with the giver inside of
[1:27:01] them I want to give her didn't worry
[1:27:09] about Holly's other thing because if I
[1:27:11] got to give her he'll work it out
[1:27:15] because the gift is God when it says he
[1:27:20] gave some was he giving himself are you
[1:27:25] following me
[1:27:26] we're trying to quit he gave himself the
[1:27:31] greatest gift that could ever be he's
[1:27:33] Almighty God to come down to a mortal
[1:27:36] human being and just fellowship with you
[1:27:43] do you and the giver becomes one so you
[1:27:52] don't understand you know it's hard to
[1:27:56] explain something to people that they
[1:27:58] they don't experience it I can walk in
[1:28:04] the study and be down and out and just
[1:28:06] all on the bottom and I can say Lord I
[1:28:11] got a preach Sunday would you just help
[1:28:14] me now would you tell me what to tell
[1:28:17] the people and then I'll be all right
[1:28:20] oh yeah sometimes I get it sometimes I
[1:28:24] don't sometimes I get up and go hunting
[1:28:26] sometimes I get up and go out in the
[1:28:28] yard I go do this and do that I'll get
[1:28:30] up in the night walking through the
[1:28:31] house but you know all at once he comes
[1:28:38] and he says this is what we need
[1:28:42] okay okay then that's what it does cuz
[1:28:49] that's the gift everybody has a gift of
[1:28:53] some phone everybody has a gift of some
[1:28:58] phone but then it just gets higher and
[1:29:03] higher and higher then you come up
[1:29:05] through and you got gifts you got just
[1:29:08] now listen I'm trying to explain what at
[1:29:10] all
[1:29:10] so then you got gifts of like prophecies
[1:29:12] and and all kinds of things that's in
[1:29:14] the five spiritual gift I mean nine
[1:29:17] spiritual gift you've got all kinds then
[1:29:19] you move up another step and when you do
[1:29:21] you find up with five gifts not ten and
[1:29:26] he names them God gave the church on the
[1:29:31] day of Pentecost five gifts here's a
[1:29:38] quote from the Prophet brother Branham
[1:29:40] will the bride have a ministry he said
[1:29:45] sure she consists of apostles prophets
[1:29:52] evangelists pastors and teachers have
[1:29:55] you found your spot have you found your
[1:30:01] place because the gift will only work
[1:30:07] when you find your place the true gift
[1:30:10] then we had gifts and callings with it
[1:30:15] who was it
[1:30:17] come on maybe Roman I think he's right I
[1:30:19] believe it was Adolf Hitler that said
[1:30:22] one of those great men like that worldly
[1:30:24] mean not not Christian he said but my
[1:30:27] greatest goal is to reach the person
[1:30:31] that is the furthest away from me he
[1:30:37] didn't mean distance his greatest goal
[1:30:41] was to conquer the mind of mankind he
[1:30:47] done it had it not been for the gifts
[1:30:51] that was promised and a bride
[1:30:54] as to the age and the time we're doing
[1:30:57] he would have annihilated the world
[1:31:01] because he had it in his hand who ended
[1:31:06] World War one they don't even know what
[1:31:11] happened with Hitler he turned his whole
[1:31:17] thing over to one more and said I'm not
[1:31:20] gonna surrender I've read this the other
[1:31:22] day you know commentary about it he said
[1:31:26] I'm not gonna surrender he said you take
[1:31:32] over and you surrender the country you
[1:31:38] know what he doing wasn't a bunker and
[1:31:41] killed himself because he knew that
[1:31:43] that's as far as he could go
[1:31:52] Church what about it can we depend upon
[1:31:55] the fivefold ministry because listen
[1:32:00] you're either going to depend on the
[1:32:02] fivefold ministry to carry you through
[1:32:03] or carry you through and as much you
[1:32:05] know are you gonna put your dependence
[1:32:07] on brother branham racing you've got to
[1:32:10] do one of the other no come on I don't
[1:32:12] have no problem with anybody I need
[1:32:13] first one nobody ain't telling nothing
[1:32:15] about it I'm just saying you're gonna
[1:32:17] have to do it well get on with it
[1:32:24] he said well you sure do sound funny
[1:32:27] because you say that he could raise and
[1:32:28] preach through 30 40 day yeah but I
[1:32:30] ain't sitting around right now fiddling
[1:32:32] my thumbs
[1:32:35] I'm still trying my best to let that
[1:32:41] gift speak to the people that's my goal
[1:32:49] to let the gift that God gave me be for
[1:32:53] you cuz that's what he done that's why
[1:32:57] you've got a five fold ministry j esus
[1:33:01] co jesus christ is the gift that was
[1:33:05] given you say you sure took a long way
[1:33:10] to get to the Hat you know these ins
[1:33:14] tells you that five gifts are given
[1:33:16] those five gifts in jesus christ the
[1:33:20] word for the Aged in time come on
[1:33:22] musician the word for the age in time is
[1:33:30] the gift given to the church
[1:33:38] yeah what do you think about it that's
[1:33:44] why I don't want no problem I'm just as
[1:33:51] happy as can be about one time but I'm
[1:33:55] brokenhearted about the little bride
[1:33:59] because she's not putting her dependence
[1:34:03] upon the five film industry I'm sorry
[1:34:08] that's the life statement the people of
[1:34:12] this message are not putting their
[1:34:13] dependence upon the fivefold ministry
[1:34:17] you see Church why I stand wounded
[1:34:20] because you see if brother brand is
[1:34:22] gonna come back he's gonna have to come
[1:34:24] back through and teach the ministry and
[1:34:26] let the ministry teach us you tell me no
[1:34:33] problem you tell me who's in the best
[1:34:37] shape you sent down nervous and
[1:34:39] littering can't figure it out and
[1:34:41] wondered this happen I don't know if
[1:34:43] that we need to go here we need to go
