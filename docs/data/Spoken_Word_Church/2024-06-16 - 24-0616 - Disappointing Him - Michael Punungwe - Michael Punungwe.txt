========================================

dear father Lord we thank you for this day Lord thank you for allowing us to gather together as Believers Lord just to come here and be in your word Lord and and to search your word search your scriptures with o people like Precious Faith Lord to lift each other up Lord that we each bring our own lick of fire lord and just add to the the fire lord and just pray that you forgive us of all our sins Lord pray for all the prayer requests Lord those who are down lord lift them up Lord those who are sick heal them Lord pray for those who can't be there Lord just pray that they'll be back with us soon pray for those traveling Lord and just pray for all things in your part precious name of Jesus Christ I pray amen amen if you have your scriptures today we can turn to um John chapter 9 give your Bible today everyone sit down all right still getting into the flow of things so John chapter 9 verse one and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him so sometimes we wonder you know why do things happen why are there trials why why why are bad things happening to people and the Believers but God is saying that no one sinned no no one sinned that this man should should be born blind but it's simply that the works of God will be made manifest in him so it's no one's fault you know he who sined that maybe you would have diabetes who sined that you would suffer from this Affliction who sined that maybe you'd have depression who sinned that you know you would have have high blood pressure who sinned that these things would come upon us that people were getting car ACD and car wxs and who sin that these things would happen and it's that nobody sinned you know nobody sinned it's just that the works of God be made manifest in you and through our struggles that is how God will make his work manifest you know like like brother Brenham said you know he has to he has to display his attributes he couldn't save if there was no one lost he couldn't heal if there was no one sick you know and and the question is asked who sinned and it might be the same person who sinned when job was persecuted and there was no one who sinned when job was persecuted job was job was challenged by the devil the devil said God put a hedge around him and that's why job was righteous because job was in a in a place of you know he had wealth he had children he had a wife he he had many things that made life you know better on him easier on him and made made the Troubles of life you know seem maybe a little more distant than it was for the other people and so the devil calls this out and says well there's a hedge around him of course he's righteous but when job when job lost his his cattle he was righteous still and when job lost his money he was righteous still when his sons died when his children died he was righteous still when his wife said Curse God and die he was still righteous when his friends rebuked him he was still righteous so don't be surprised when these things happen to you don't don't be in shock you know we know we're children of God we know this is a war this is not a lunch table this is not a picnic this is a battlefield so don't be surprised and and maintain your righteousness God is testing you he's going to see how you react you know and and maybe he said you know have you considered my servant and maybe that's why he's things were happening so that you can prove yourself as a Believer the same way that God must manifest his attributes when someone is L he is to save them when someone is sick he must heal them well if you're a Christian when you go through a trial you have to prove that you're a Christian you have to prove that your faith is stronger than your trial that your faith in God is going to take you through this you will overcome through this so it's going to be it's going to be God working in you and and manifesting those those his Works in you through what you suffer and through the trials that you go through and let's turn to Ecclesiastes chapter 7 eclesiastes chapter 7 verse three sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance The Heart Is Made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of Mirth it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools so this is it can be a strange scripture to read Because typically you know as humans we always want to have a joy you always to have laughter we want to have good time and you know it is a good time to get around Believers in Fellowship but you know sometimes having a good time and laughing isn't what's going to perfect us that's not what's that's not what's going to edify us it's going to build us up you know and and even you think of uh that's that's where all your character is built it's through it's through the things you go through you know parents often say that expression you know it it builds character when your kids are going through something you say well it's okay it builds character so there's things that they go through where it's like well that that's actually going to help them become a more mature person CU if they don't go through anything you know they're going to end up spoiled and rotten and and the Bible says you know you spare the rod and you spoil the child you know and God is our father so he's not going to he's not going to spare the rod he's not going to spoil us so that we cannot be perfected you know he wants us to come to Perfection he wants us to grow up to grow to maturity so he's not going to spread the rod he's not going to go easy on us he's not going to but also won't tempt us Beyond what's common of man as the Bible says he's not going to tempt us beyond what we can handle beyond what we can go to him for and seek strength from him for so he's never going to to tempt us or or or you know rock the boat some so much that we we fall over and we capsize he's always going to keep us right in line with how we're supposed to be and and even that scripture you know sorrow you know the house of Mirth and you think of you know the house of Mirth and mirth is essentially just happiness or laughter or or maybe a comedy show or mirth is is that kind of Celebration or or activity you participate in where everything's everything's fine everything's good you know everything's great and you're just in the house of Mirth and and that's where that's where that's where the world is at you know and sometimes you see people doing what they doing we know it's pride month and we know there's all these different things going on and that's the house of merth they being people are being told what they want to hear and not what they need to hear but when you come to the word of God it's going to tell you what you need to hear even if it's an uncomfortable truth even if it stirs you up even if it it really Pricks your heart it's that's what it's was supposed to do you know cuz when you go out in the world they say oh everything's fine you're okay the way you are and you know and that that doesn't prick your heart when you come to the word and then someone comes in the pulpit and says something and and applies to your life and even if it's something that you're doing wrong it's going to prick your heart it's going to it's going to stir something up that wasn't stirred up before but when you're just given you know a validation and oh everything's okay and and you know just wave everything off and the the world's not the problem you don't have any problems you're perfect the way you are no that that's that's that's a lie and and it's going to it's a lie that's really going to do more harm than good people do that in intention they kind of intend to you know help you out and lift you up but is what really is going to edify you and and perform excuse me per improve improve and perfect you is what's going to be the things that are hard to go through it's going to be the sorrow you know that's why sorrow is better than laughter because the the the sorrow of your countenance but your heart will be made better so it it won't always feel good but it is good for you kind of like medicine sometimes and as the scripture said it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools so I pray that you know when we come to um when we come to church we're not here to hear the song of fools you know even um Paul said you know if I come here and I try to please man I can no longer be a servant of God so when people are up here we're not trying to appeal to you we are trying to help you but we're not trying to appeal to you know what you want to feel or or the things that maybe would sound good to you but we're trying to edify you and bring you closer to what the scriptures say because you see churches where they don't really teach the scriptures they just say what people want to hear and the Prosperity Gospel and you know and that's why you see these huge crowds and it's cuz they don't really know what they believe in so they can draws many people in and they can kind of cater to the people and me but God said it's always it's going to be the minority it's going to be the smaller group that that really gets through because they're going to be preaching the truth and the truth is abrasive the truth can hurt sometimes the truth it's not always going to be a comfortable atmosphere in the truth but it's going to be what's good for you it's going to be it's going to be better for you in the long run so you must go through struggle to build character God will not spare the rod on his children amen let's turn to Psalms 141 41 verse4 Psalms 141:4 incline not my heart to any evil thing to practice Wicked works with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties so dainties is once again just something pleasant something that that is nice to hear something that is dainties the literal definition is something that is like something good to eat you know something that's tasty so it might might it's kind of like junk food basically where you know it tastes real good but it's really not good for you it's going to cause you a lot of problems especially if you eat it consistently you're going to start gaining weight you're going to start getting headaches many things will happen if you continous to eat junk food it's not good for you and that's that that's what the world is is trying to give you is the dainties the work those that men that work iniquity they're trying to give you these dainties and you know brother brandham he really talked about how it's really going to be close it's going to be very close and it's going to be the religious world that we really have to look out for you know everyone looks out you know uh outside the world and looks oh look what they're doing look the Muslims are doing look at what the government's doing but brother R so the Antichrist is going to be a religious spirit it's going to be so close so you really have to watch that spirit and it's going to be you know maybe someone who who comes up here and really tries to make an impression on you but they're going to slip something in there where it's something that you want to hear and something that that that you don't really need to hear so they're going to try and slip something in there that'll um you know just like when you know when these crimes happen when someone is you know date raped or someone just slips something in their drink you know most of that drink is still intact but there's a little something in there that's going to knock you out and it's going to be for evil so it's just going to be that little thing you know like brother Dale us say the little spes little foxes will spoil the vine so it's going to be those little things we need to watch out for we want to be pure and completely pure before God's eyes you know because God is not going to accept any any leaven in our bread amen there's not any leaven in the doctrine any little thing it's going to make the whole lump corrupt so we don't want any of that we want to be completely pure when we you know when we search the scriptures and when we live our lives in verse 5 says let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head for yet my prayer shall be their shall be in their Calamity so it's quite literally saying let the righteous smite me so I I believe that we have you know good ministry here and and there's good ministers in this gospel and they're going to say things that are that might you feel like you're being smited you're going to feel like you're getting hit over the head but it's good it's a kindness it says it shall be a kindness because you know there's many people who their ministers and their their preachers they don't Smite them they don't tell them what they should be doing enough and it's going to lead them you know to the wrong place if they're not careful so really to for the righteous to Smite you it it will really be a kindness you know for God to show you where you're supposed to go it will actually be a kindness even though it might hurt in the moment it is genuinely a kindness so if your heart is stirred by what some a brother says it is a kindness that your heart is being stirred at all amen and let's turn to Psalm 17 17 verse1 hear the right oh Lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips let my sentence come forth from thy presence let Thine Eyes behold the things that are equal thou Hast proved Mine Heart thou has visited me in the night thou has tried me and shalt find nothing I am purpose that my mouth shall not transgress now that's a wonderful scripture thou thou has tried me and Sh find nothing that's a wonderful thing if if God can try all our lives if God can really examine all of our Lives can do a full scale investigation on our lives and find nothing amen that's what we need to that's what we're going to need you know to get through through um to get to heaven to to be purified to be perfected to for all all the all the virtues that we need to add we're going to need God to look through our lives and find nothing and that's the mature bride he's looking for amen but as long as he's looking through the blood he'll find nothing so you just claim the blood and that's what it's for you claim the blood so that God will find nothing wrong with your life because the blood the red blood will make everything white as snow amen so those things he'll find nothing and and that should be our desire as Christians that he'll try our life and find nothing and that as the scripture says I am purpose that my mouth shall not transgress amen and uh let's go skip to verse 8 verse eight verse eight says keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy Wing from the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who Compass me about they are enclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudly they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to the Earth like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places arise O Lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword amen I love that scripture arise O Lord disappoint him amen and we know the devil is also compared to as a lion who is lurking who is seeking seeking pray but we want to pray arise oh Lord disappoint him when next time you pray and just pray for pray for whatever you're going through and say arise oh Lord disappoint him disappoint the devil you know cuz when we pray for you know Revelation the devil's disappointed when you pray for your children the devil is disappointed you know when when people you stop being a Halfway Christian and you want to live the full scriptures of God the devil is disappointed you know when you when you show up to Sunday school and you show up to church on time so you don't miss Sunday school and you show up and the in certain things you know that you know you should be doing that maybe you don't always do the devil is disappointed when you see someone really living the word the devil is disappointed I guarantee when the devil was trying job and he was letting the God was letting these things happen to job the devil was disappointed because he took his cattle away he said you built a hedge around him you made it easy for him and then he takes it all the way and the devil was disappointed and he said well actually and he kept moving the goalpost to keep try try job further he kept trying to say well actually you know well you know uh well there's more there and he kept trying to kept trying to argue and argue but the devil was disappointed because every time job was tried he stayed righteous and he kept staying righteous and he kept talking to the Lord he always you know kept praying and he he he kept in communion and in relationship with the lord the devil was disappointed so that is our that is our goal today is to disappoint the devil you know and the first thing that job did when he when when he when he first lost everything the first thing he did was worship and he said blessed is the name of the Lord for the lord giveth and taketh away way but it says job worship that was the very first thing he did amen and I guarantee the devil was disappointed so next time you go through something maybe just have a little praise break have a little worship sing a song to the Lord read a scripture the devil will be disappointed because he expects he expects when something bad happens to you that you'll be all down and your head will be down and you'll be you know you feel like you're you're not you're not there and you feel like you're just not living up to what you're supposed to but just sing sing a little song to the Lord sing a song you know that's on your heart and you know the scripture says he'll give you a new song as the scripture um I believe it was Ecclesiastes we read that said you know they want to hear the song of fools but God said he'll give you a new song in your heart you know we sing that song Blessed Assurance this is my story this is my song we don't want the song of fools we want the song of Blessed Assurance we want the song of you know creating me a new heart oh Lord we want the song of redemption that the Angels can't sing We want those songs we don't want the song of fools we want to be rebuked by the righteous and we want to you know fully receive that in the way that we're supposed to and in the spirit that we're supposed to and so don't be Halfway Christian you know come to church the devil will be disappointed when you come to church and and you hear something that will edify you and that'll that'll really help you the devil will be disappointed and uh verse 14 psalm 17:14 for men which are thy hand oh Lord from Men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest with the head Treasures they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes ask the musicians to come at this time um so it says once again it says the the evil you know they're their um their bellies are full of children and we know there's definitely a any parent knows and most people know there's a spiritual battle with our children with with all of the children and that people are trying to attack the children and you know the the Bible says to raise them up in the way they should go but the world is trying to do the same thing in the way that they want them to go but we know that we have we have a a a calling you know to raise these children and live brother Dale said live before the children and that's what's really going to help them is living before them and living their life continuously before them so we don't want the once again disappoint him if the devil's looking to take your children if he's looking to to strike you down or trying to you know make make you feel down and then you have that that that low atmosphere around your kids or you have this depressed spirit and and and your kids your children are going to see that so we want to disappoint the devil and don't let them see that let them see you worship when when something bad happens let your children see you worship let your children see you go to prayer and get on your knees and guess what they'll do when they come across their own trials going they do exactly what you did the same way they learn to walk by looking at you walk they're going to learn to pray they're going to learn to worship by looking at you worship amen because babies don't learn to walk on their own if a baby didn't have you know see adults going around and walking on their two legs they would never think to do it but they see a model they see an example example and instinctively they follow that example so the same thing with with Parenthood and just even just even if you're not a parent even just a membering the church and just showing you know the younger people how how really how to live and I pray that are younger people would disappoint the devil based off your example Amen in verse 15 as for me I will Behold thy face in righteousness I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness and I love that scripture you can it can be interpreted maybe in a few different ways as in when I awake with thy likeness that you know you awake close to the Lord and the Lord is there when you awake and when you rise but also I think it can be interpreted as you know if we're Christians we awake with his likeness as then we look like him we walk like him we talk like him we act like him and and so that you know we and Jesus are the same we're joint erors with him so when we he said be perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect so if we walk perfect they're going to confuse us for Christ and I think that would be a great thing for them to confuse us with I think uh even our brother Daryl ward has has a testimony it's probably better for him to tell it but I think he said he was he was you know being kind to a woman in an airport or something and I guess she was blind and then she asked them are you Jesus and that's a wonderful thing that you know if you were to help someone and they would think man this person is are you Jesus and for you to be so full of that spirit and to be such a kind and and doing what the scriptures say to do do and be so just be such so in that atmosphere and so in that way of thinking and that way of doing and to be reading your scriptures and be praying like coming to church prayed up and all these things for someone to ask are you Jesus so when the scripture says you know when I awake with thy likeness I believe that's what we should be attaining that's what we we should be aiming for is to awake with his likeness to be in his likeness so amen God bless you [Music]
