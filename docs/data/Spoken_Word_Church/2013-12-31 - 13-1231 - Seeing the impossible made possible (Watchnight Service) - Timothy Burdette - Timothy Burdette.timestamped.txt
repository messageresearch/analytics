[19:59] I believe that don't you I believe

[20:06] need anything I believe he'll give it to
[20:08] you you believe that let's sing this and
[20:10] we'll get right into the word if you
[20:11] don't mind I stood on the banks of a
[20:16] wide raging
[20:17] River
[20:20] trusting I'd get
[20:24] across I've made my way through some
[20:28] Valley
[20:29] and
[20:30] deserts believeing I'd never get
[20:36] lost I stood on the feet of what felt
[20:41] like Mount Everest knowing I have the
[20:45] strength for the
[20:48] clim oh but through every trial each
[20:53] test and
[20:55] Temptation one thing is sure every
[21:01] time over and
[21:04] over again and again God is
[21:10] faithful and over and
[21:14] over again and again through it
[21:18] all he makes me
[21:23] able to stand and survive to come
[21:27] through Al when it sure looks like I
[21:32] just can't
[21:35] win Jesus is with me I claim the victory
[21:42] over and over
[21:45] [Applause]
[21:47] again now if you ask me why I've got no
[21:53] hesitation God does everything he said
[21:57] he'll do
[22:01] I'd simply
[22:02] say every battle has taught me there's
[22:07] nothing he won't help me
[22:11] through so why should I listen now dwell
[22:16] on the hardships and
[22:18] struggles if I look just beyond them I
[22:22] can
[22:23] see that the way this will end is with
[22:28] great
[22:30] celebration and deep in my heart I
[22:36] believe that over and over again and
[22:42] again God is
[22:45] faithful said over and over again and
[22:51] again through it all he makes me aable
[22:58] to stand and survive to come through
[23:03] alive when it seems like I just can't
[23:09] win oh but Jesus is with me I claim the
[23:16] victory over and over
[23:21] again all to stand and survive to come
[23:26] through a life when it sure looks like I
[23:30] just can't
[23:34] win Jesus is with me I claim the victory
[23:41] over and over
[23:44] [Music]
[23:56] again y'all forgive me I tore
[24:00] my I tore four weeks ago I
[24:03] fell and tore my shoulder all the
[24:06] pieces and
[24:09] uh it's giving me some
[24:12] fits so they want to go in I got to go
[24:14] back to a specialist next week and they
[24:17] want to go in there and do some cutting
[24:20] and all that stuff which I ain't too
[24:22] find
[24:23] of so we'll just have to wait and see
[24:25] what they what takes what they do but
[24:28] right God's good ain't he do you love
[24:31] him my name's Timothy berett I got
[24:34] brother Tim ml with me he's uh he's been
[24:37] with me now
[24:39] for 12 13 years and I think brother Tim
[24:42] has and he's my he's a a great
[24:46] Minister and uh only thing about it I
[24:48] don't like him going outside of my
[24:49] church to preach cuz he's my help but
[24:53] he's been out a couple of times he is a
[24:55] great Minister a great help to me and he
[24:58] is also my trumpet player play a trumpet
[25:01] man like I have never heard in my life
[25:03] this guy can play but it's good to be
[25:06] with you I know Brother Sam we we seen
[25:09] each other several years ago in Indiana
[25:13] right at the Tabernacle and then uh
[25:16] brother Wade uh I remember him and he
[25:18] came over the other day and we got to
[25:20] fellowshiping a little bit and so one
[25:22] thing led to the other but here we are
[25:24] and it is good to be in the house of God
[25:26] with you we're coming out of a
[25:29] one year and going into
[25:32] another and uh there's all kind of uh
[25:37] problems trials test
[25:40] troubles that you're facing that I'm
[25:43] facing the world is facing the only
[25:47] difference
[25:48] is we've got somebody to face them with
[25:51] us they look for the government to do
[25:54] help them or this person or this or that
[25:57] we only have one person we call him
[26:00] Jesus Christ but I believe he's the one
[26:03] that can really help us I believe he's
[26:05] the one that can do what we need to be
[26:07] done and if we ask him I believe he'll
[26:09] do that for us do you believe that but
[26:11] we are glad to be in service with you
[26:13] tonight I am not a long-winded preacher
[26:16] and brother Tim them tells me every now
[26:17] and then I am a long- windy preacher but
[26:19] I said if y'all could just feel what it
[26:21] feels like standing there it's hard to
[26:23] quit sometimes right but uh then they
[26:26] said they have service to about 5 out 12
[26:28] here I said I told my church Sunday
[26:29] night I says but I'm going to make use
[26:31] of that time but I won't do you that way
[26:35] so we get to hear some more singing and
[26:36] fellowship later on but the word is the
[26:39] most important part and we love the word
[26:43] amen I uh trying to find the mind of the
[26:46] Lord and to uh say the right things that
[26:49] will be a help to you a blessing to you
[26:52] things that you need not just things
[26:53] that's you know I want to preach and say
[26:56] something Brother Sam that will help the
[26:58] people and that's the most important
[27:01] thing and I'm a I'm a big Minister on
[27:04] preaching on overcoming because I
[27:06] believe that that's one big thing today
[27:08] is we need to overcome and be an
[27:11] overcomer and I want to look at a little
[27:13] thought you know uh I spoke at my church
[27:16] a here a while back and I've kind of put
[27:19] several things together as I was looking
[27:21] at it this morning and pray and in my
[27:23] study to be able to speak to you tonight
[27:26] so we just pray that he'll come and just
[27:29] open his word and I think everything be
[27:32] a lot better off so if you come to hear
[27:35] him I think you'll be okay think you'll
[27:37] be okay and I do believe the
[27:40] message 100% believe this message I do
[27:43] read a few quotes if that's all right
[27:44] with you and uh I've never been here to
[27:47] to this place and I think we but I it
[27:50] was closer than I thought Brother Sam
[27:51] when I started out so uh we ain't far
[27:54] from you at all but we'll get over here
[27:56] and fellowship with y'all sometimes and
[27:58] and one of these days Brother Sam we
[28:00] won't have to leave be on the other side
[28:02] we won't have to leave but appreciate
[28:04] you coming tonight may the Lord richly
[28:06] bless you may something be said that
[28:07] would encourage you as we uh and I do
[28:10] love
[28:11] amens I do love I'm a preacher at loves
[28:14] amen so if you'll get in there and amen
[28:16] we'll get in there and have church and
[28:17] we'll have a good time you know it don't
[28:19] matter if it's five here 10 here 100
[28:21] here five it don't matter God don't care
[28:23] right all God needs is somebody to get
[28:26] out of the way and let him come in and
[28:28] everything will be all right but I want
[28:29] to preach on a little subject called
[28:31] seeing the impossible made possible
[28:33] seeing the impossible made possible are
[28:37] conquering conquering overcoming
[28:39] speaking of conquering speaking of
[28:41] overcoming the impossible things that
[28:43] people think that are impossible that
[28:45] Satan gets us to see this impossible
[28:48] what he's done Brother Sam he's took in
[28:49] this hour and took fear and gried the
[28:51] people's lives with it he took worry
[28:53] brother M said worry causes cancer worry
[28:55] does this and all these things he said
[28:57] but what Satan's done he's took fear and
[28:59] he's gripped the people's lives with it
[29:01] and they stand today in fear right but I
[29:03] believe we've got a God that we don't
[29:06] have to be in that kind of fear if you
[29:09] would have your bibles if you would
[29:10] stand with me just one more time I would
[29:12] appreciate it in Jude 1 uh just for
[29:15] little scripture reading here for just a
[29:17] minute or two and then we'll go right
[29:18] into the word let me read you this
[29:20] little quote if you don't mind why
[29:21] you're turning there brother M says in
[29:24] the message of Grace he said now a lot
[29:26] of you Bible readers say that says
[29:28] profess and profess and confess is the
[29:30] same word he says see and he says made
[29:33] the high priest he said in the book of
[29:34] Hebrews third chapter making
[29:36] intercessions Upon Our confession then
[29:38] he can't do nothing until we first
[29:40] confess that he's done it right now
[29:42] listen he said see you get down here at
[29:45] the altar and pray all night wouldn't do
[29:47] you a bit of good unless you believe
[29:49] that he forgives you then you stand up
[29:52] then as much Faith as you have that's
[29:54] where he saidou once live way down here
[29:56] in the muck of sin you young convert
[29:59] converts he says you believe you're
[30:02] saved he said you've raised up here you
[30:05] raised a little higher he said what does
[30:06] that your faith because you believe
[30:08] you're a Christian now you'll live above
[30:11] these things now see if you want a
[30:12] little if you want to raise a little
[30:14] higher have a little bit more faith CZ
[30:17] it's unlimited just keep on climbing and
[30:20] an impossible can be made real amen now
[30:24] listen an impossible can be made real
[30:28] all things are possible to them that
[30:30] believeth that's right if you say to
[30:32] this mountain be moved don't doubt in
[30:33] your heart but believe what you say come
[30:35] to pass you can have what you say right
[30:39] listen friends that didn't stop when
[30:40] brother Bram died exactly amen and
[30:43] that's what I've run across is preaching
[30:45] from different places what I have seen
[30:47] within the ranks of this message people
[30:50] don't believe that no more right but the
[30:53] same God that was with William Brown is
[30:55] the same God that's with me the same God
[30:58] is with Brother Sam brother Tim and you
[31:00] different Brothers if there's any
[31:01] ministers here and even to the body of
[31:02] Jesus Christ see we what we've done
[31:04] Brother Sam we'll limit it to the
[31:06] ministry limit no God he's the same for
[31:08] the believer brother B said if you
[31:10] believe in your the scripture says in
[31:12] Mark 11:22 23 24 didn't say if a
[31:14] minister does it he said if ye don't
[31:17] doubt in your heart when you ask B then
[31:19] it shall be given so it don't take a
[31:21] minister to do it you can do it you
[31:24] believe that in Jude 1 verse three
[31:28] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[31:30] write unto you of the Comm of the common
[31:33] salvation it was needful for me to write
[31:35] unto you now listen very closely it was
[31:38] needful for me to write unto you and
[31:40] exhort you that you should earnestly oh
[31:43] God contend for the faith that was once
[31:46] delivered to the Saints right not
[31:48] another gospel the same Faith right he
[31:52] says for there are certain men crept in
[31:56] unawares oh my who were before all o
[31:59] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[32:01] men turning the grace of our God into
[32:05] lves and denying the only Lord God and
[32:09] our Lord Jesus Christ
[32:11] amen
[32:12] contending for the faith that was once
[32:15] delivered to the Saints you can be
[32:17] seated Revelations 22 I want to read the
[32:20] little scripture there Revelations 22:1
[32:23] 17 and the spirit and the bride says the
[32:27] same thing right amen they say come and
[32:30] let him that heareth say come let him
[32:32] that a thirst come whosoever will let
[32:34] him take Water of Life freely for I
[32:36] testify unto every man that Hearth the
[32:38] words of the prophets of this book If
[32:40] any man shall proph If any man shall add
[32:43] unto these things God shall add un the
[32:45] plagues that are written in this book If
[32:46] any man shall take away from the words
[32:48] of this book of this prophecy God shall
[32:50] take away his part out of the book of
[32:53] life and out of the holy city and from
[32:54] the things which are written in this
[32:57] book The Lord At His blessings to the
[32:58] reading of the word now we begin to look
[33:01] at this little subject here it's a
[33:02] wonderful subject I believe it'll
[33:03] encourage you and help you as we open
[33:06] tomorrow be a new year we never would
[33:09] actually even thought we'd be in
[33:10] 2014 as a as a as a I was raised in the
[33:14] message my dad come into the message
[33:15] preaching this message in
[33:18] 1968 uh and then from that I was born 65
[33:22] and then from that time on he's been
[33:23] preaching this message and he went out
[33:25] the scene in 1992 February and then I've
[33:28] had the church and we didn't have a
[33:30] pastor for several years and you one
[33:31] come in and left you know how all this
[33:33] goes and then God began to deal with me
[33:35] and uh I moved into the position that
[33:37] God I felt the Lord wanted me to be in
[33:39] so I've been in that position now at
[33:41] Life Tabernacle for 15 years and I'm
[33:43] going to be honest with you I never
[33:45] would have thought coming up as a young
[33:47] man in this message and being raised by
[33:49] a message parents you would have never
[33:51] made me believe we'd ever step foot to
[33:55] 2013 much less 2014 yeah well the Tim of
[33:58] you was raised in as as I was and he
[34:00] believes and sees I'm sure y'all see the
[34:02] same thing but I want you to realize it
[34:06] if if it does last to 2014 15 16
[34:09] whatever he's still the same God God
[34:11] don't change right and that's what's so
[34:14] good about it God don't change no let me
[34:16] sh I'm gonna read just a few quotes and
[34:18] I'm gonna get right into my thought if
[34:19] that's all right with you brother says
[34:21] he said now that's how I'll have to come
[34:24] pass come to pass we've got it right
[34:26] here he said says here we are
[34:28] organizations the mark of the beast is
[34:30] upon us just exactly like the first
[34:32] Beast an image unto it a Federation of
[34:34] churches joining of power and they made
[34:37] a image unto the Beast and if if he
[34:39] could both speak it it it done the same
[34:43] thing the first Beast did before right
[34:45] in our clutches he said what time is it
[34:48] is there a POS is there it possible
[34:51] Samson stands there and says what time
[34:54] he said Samson happened to think that
[34:56] great God he's om omnipresent he's the
[34:59] Everlasting God I see my mistake he says
[35:02] I'm going to repent and he cried out
[35:05] that there is a possible that we could
[35:08] do the same thing it's possible we could
[35:10] do the same thing Oh my he said they of
[35:14] that day this day don't see the Visions
[35:16] like Samson if we could only see the
[35:18] visions of this start right now right
[35:21] now this is possible again he says they
[35:25] stood and watched Jesus perform Miracles
[35:28] and so forth declared himself to be the
[35:31] Messiah they just couldn't see it he
[35:34] said they've got eyes but they can't see
[35:36] they're blind Glory he said Samson was
[35:40] blind but here's what Samson recognized
[35:42] that the church has never come to it yet
[35:45] now listen what he says he said here's
[35:47] what Samson recognized but he was blind
[35:50] but the church has never come to it yet
[35:53] right means he's still given us time to
[35:56] get there right notice he said they
[35:59] haven't come through yet he knew there
[36:00] was it was possible to come back if the
[36:03] church could only see that but the
[36:05] people of today don't seem to catch that
[36:07] Vision they don't seem to catch it that
[36:10] it is possible it doesn't come through
[36:13] now he said you can shout a little more
[36:14] Pat your hands a little more dance a
[36:16] little more he said that isn't in it
[36:18] it's back to the word there it is
[36:21] possible of coming back and getting the
[36:23] word on the inside again you bypassed it
[36:27] there notice there he said they sat
[36:29] tight oh sure they clap your hands yes
[36:31] sir but you see thou the sails without
[36:35] an anchor right now here we see how far
[36:38] that they had gotten away from the Lord
[36:39] if you read the scripture there in Jude
[36:41] where it talked about the earnestly
[36:43] contending for the faith if I'm not
[36:45] mistaken it was like brother brother Sam
[36:47] 33 years and they had come to the place
[36:50] in their life that they were so
[36:53] backslid 33 years here and Jude begins
[36:57] to come and prophesy here how they need
[36:59] to get back to contend for the very
[37:01] faith that the Saints once had and
[37:04] that's what this message is to do this
[37:07] message didn't come just to get us a
[37:09] bunch of make us a bunch of lazy
[37:11] Christians come on church this church
[37:14] this message didn't come to make me a
[37:16] lazy Minister make you a bunch of lazy
[37:18] congregation or lazy this and lazy that
[37:20] it came to pull us back this message
[37:23] come that Pro God sent that Prophet to
[37:26] bring us back right
[37:28] back to the same Faith they had not a
[37:30] different faith not another Faith the
[37:32] same thing that made this work it will
[37:34] work
[37:36] now amen the same faith that Peter had
[37:40] same faith that Paul these great Saints
[37:42] not something different the faith notice
[37:45] it says the faith that was once right so
[37:48] you mean to tell me brother sister that
[37:49] once they once believed it like this
[37:52] come on but then they begin to get into
[37:54] a backsliding condition but then God
[37:57] begin to send ministers down through the
[37:59] church ages all the way through and that
[38:01] church age reformers said them reformers
[38:04] come and they begin to reform bringing
[38:06] it back to the
[38:08] word amen see and that's what this this
[38:11] this great message that God sent through
[38:13] a prophet that's what it's done today
[38:15] amen it's done the same identical thing
[38:18] is to bring his brother M just didn't
[38:20] reform he was that Prophet that stood
[38:21] there that would break and bring that
[38:23] word to Vindication on now notice the
[38:27] word once oh I love this means once and
[38:31] for
[38:32] all Hallelujah it don't mean it don't
[38:36] mean something else that word once when
[38:37] Jew speaks this once means once and for
[38:40] all both once and again listen both once
[38:44] and again twice several times repeatedly
[38:47] so if it comes brother Tim it's got to
[38:50] deliver the same thing that it did
[38:52] that you can't take the message that
[38:55] they preach and preach that they expect
[38:56] it to bring something else if we believe
[38:58] like they did it bring bring the same
[39:03] results but see what we've done in this
[39:05] message we're looking for something
[39:06] different oh oh yeah come on
[39:10] now listen if I say something out of the
[39:13] way you ain't you don't worry about it
[39:15] you have to they what your pastor says
[39:17] come on is that is that all right you're
[39:20] all right but notice the thing of it is
[39:23] people's looking for something different
[39:26] they're looking for are looking for that
[39:28] but the Bible says just contend for that
[39:30] same
[39:32] Faith people thinks the impossible
[39:35] things can't happen
[39:36] anymore but Brother Sam we're in an hour
[39:39] and age where we need those things in
[39:40] our lives we need to be able to overcome
[39:43] I preached on a message several months
[39:44] ago on overcoming and conquering brother
[39:46] Tim you remember that how many people
[39:48] can overcome this and overcome that and
[39:50] overcome but yet the thing is they don't
[39:52] conquer it if you don't conquer it that
[39:54] thing's coming back again amen you got
[39:57] to overcome it and Conquer it you got to
[39:59] see the impossible things that Satan
[40:01] makes looks impossible but yet by the
[40:03] word of God we bring it to
[40:06] possibilities
[40:08] amen
[40:10] notice now what I've come across on a
[40:12] lot of them where I speak they want a
[40:14] gospel with no outward
[40:18] emotions now I'll go ahead and let you
[40:20] I'll let you know I'm Pentecost from the
[40:22] inside to the
[40:24] outside I don't believe there's one mess

[48:42] Covenant is where the word was where the
[48:43] strolls laid with his gold and its wing
[48:46] backed upon and the people and and the
[48:48] Levites towed on the shoulders it's not
[48:50] even there but the Bible says God looked
[48:53] down and said this house is greater than
[48:55] the first amen
[48:58] what made it
[49:00] Greater it couldn't been all the
[49:02] furniture the the The Omen po all there

[49:06] there many of the things aon's robbed
[49:09] that budded it wasn't there but yet what
[49:11] made it glorious what made it more
[49:14] glorious than the first one it was the
[49:16] bodies that was there why God had come
[49:18] down in the presence of his people not
[49:21] just
[49:23] Furniture Hallelujah Oh Glory God wants
[49:27] somebody to put his word in he don't

[52:31] how many people has actually Brother Sam
[52:33] left this

[52:46] garbage hey I may never get to come back
[52:48] and preach here but I'm going to get it
[52:49] out one
[52:53] time they preach this garbage that these
[52:55] preachers crop up in their minds and
[52:58] people start looking for it brother Sam
[53:00] but when it don't happen exactly they're
[53:03] all tore of pieces because it didn't
[53:06] happen and they didn't see
[53:10] nothing they followed it for years and
[53:12] they seen this and they look for this
[53:14] and they look for this but then it don't

[53:43] something that wasn't going to come to
[53:45] pass to begin with amen you got to
[53:48] preach this message right down the
[53:49] middle of the road friends you got to
[53:51] preach it and get to people to contend
[53:52] for the faith that that Prophet had he
[53:54] had it
[53:56] amen but here let me lay this on you he

[55:24] Vue you know right and when I did that I
[55:27] became foolish virgin
[55:29] oh they preaching the other churches
[55:31] around my house I knew Tim didn't really
[55:33] believe his message oh my I knew he
[55:35] didn't have it when he took his picture
[55:37] down oh
[55:40] my what does a picture have to do with
[55:42] me believing this message I had somebody
[55:45] tell me the other day brother Tim was
[55:46] there and he he kind of snuck off and
[55:48] left me holding the bag cuz he knew what
[55:49] was happening he knew what was going on
[55:52] so he just kind of snuck out the door
[55:53] and left me standing there holding the
[55:54] bag and I didn't want to get into it

[56:19] know I want to know where that makes me
[56:22] a part of the
[56:23] message friends I was a part of the
[56:25] message before the foundation the world
[56:26] according to the Bible that's
[56:30] right I was a part of God before the
[56:33] foundation of the world is that what not
[56:34] scripture says your name was written in
[56:36] the book when not when you got saved not
[56:39] when you went to church but for the
[56:41] foundation of the

[1:08:27] Christianity there he said that's how
[1:08:29] powerful the church was that's how
[1:08:31] Mighty the church was he said but Satan
[1:08:34] wanted to see the people Satan wanted to
[1:08:36] see the people lose their confidence
[1:08:39] lose their hope lose their
[1:08:43] Vision
[1:08:45] amen Bible says in Proverbs where there
[1:08:47] no vision there people perish see that's
[1:08:50] the thing that's happened to the Sal
[1:08:51] this 2013 going into 2014 in a few more
[1:08:54] hours people's lost a vision they've
[1:08:56] lost a vision that there's a real God
[1:08:59] they lost they lost a vision that God
[1:09:01] can still heal the sick they've lost a
[1:09:03] vision that God can still Save The Lost
[1:09:05] they've lost their Vision that God can
[1:09:06] still raise the
[1:09:10] dead okay they all every message Church
[1:09:13] in the World Turns against it brother B
[1:09:14] say it's truth the Bible says it's the
[1:09:17] word amen come
[1:09:20] on Satan will always show the people the
[1:09:25] impossible thing oh my
[1:09:28] amen he'll always show you brother the
[1:09:31] something that's
[1:09:33] impossible but he'll never show you the
[1:09:35] things that's
[1:09:42] possible he always wants you to see the
[1:09:45] negative part yes
[1:09:49] siren look how Mighty Samson is this
[1:09:53] lion comes up and jumps out on him
[1:09:56] oh
[1:09:57] my the Bible says it in such the order
[1:09:59] said the spirit of the Lord come on came
[1:10:03] on him and he killed the lion now let's
[1:10:07] just look at it come on church that's
[1:10:10] impossible
[1:10:13] sure you can't go around killing Lions
[1:10:16] not with your bare
[1:10:19] hands that's
[1:10:21] impossible but the possible part was it
[1:10:23] the spirit of the Lord Came Upon him
[1:10:27] amen amen human being can't do that but
[1:10:30] God
[1:10:32] can now to us to human beings we know we
[1:10:36] understand that is
[1:10:37] impossible but when God came that's what
[1:10:40] made it possible that's the whole thing
[1:10:42] don't do it upon yourself don't look for
[1:10:44] you to do it don't think you can do it
[1:10:46] don't think I can do it brother Sam you
[1:10:48] and I can't it's God amen amen glory go
[1:10:52] into the new year 2014 where I believe
[1:10:56] all things are possible to them that
[1:10:58] can't
[1:11:01] believe we got more dead churches in
[1:11:03] this message now I ever seen in my
[1:11:05] entire
[1:11:09] life I've been in some Churches I prayed

[1:11:13] quit preaching to go
[1:11:16] home come on I'm telling you the truth
[1:11:20] I've been in some churches that is so
[1:11:23] dead that I was preaching pring praying
[1:11:26] God please tell me find a place to stop
[1:11:29] to go
[1:11:31] home I preached in some of them that

[1:11:41] this so I know I've been I preached in
[1:11:43] quite a few churches there's a lot of
[1:11:45] churches that don't believe the power of
[1:11:47] God no

[1:11:57] at all he's coming to back and he's
[1:11:59] going to do it farest you know the
[1:12:00] reason people do that church because

[1:12:04] to do
[1:12:07] it now keep in mind you talking of
[1:12:10] Samson this is the early church is not
[1:12:12] that the early church look what they're

[1:12:48] line man he had big furry head and all
[1:12:50] this and he had big paws man look at
[1:12:53] him no
[1:12:56] what Samson faced was nothing right
[1:12:58] compared to what you
[1:13:01] face oh brother Tim you taking away from
[1:13:03] Samson I'm not taking away from Samson
[1:13:05] the Bible says the spirit of the Lord
[1:13:07] Came Upon on them and he killed him
[1:13:08] right
[1:13:10] amen look at what you face every day but
[1:13:14] do but you don't know how you fight it
[1:13:16] how I got to fight it with the same
[1:13:17] Spirit he did it ain't a different
[1:13:20] Spirit glory to God that's where the
[1:13:22] people's missed it brother Sam they want
[1:13:24] to fight it the way they they want to
[1:13:25] find a way oh we're going to find a way
[1:13:27] our church teaches it you can't F the
[1:13:29] devil the way the church teaches you got
[1:13:30] to find the way the word teaches it
[1:13:33] amen that's why so many people falling
[1:13:35] by the wayside Brother Sam they're
[1:13:37] trying to find it their own way and find
[1:13:38] it way the preacher says here and the
[1:13:39] preacher shows them is the preacher
[1:13:40] shows them in and they won't get in the
[1:13:42] Bible and do the message and see for
[1:13:43] themselves what God did for them amen
[1:13:45] exctly I tell my church at home TOS of
[1:13:48] witness to it I tell my church if you
[1:13:49] don't go home and check me out
[1:13:50] something's wrong with
[1:13:52] you come on you don't go home and see if
[1:13:54] it Ain in the Bible in the message while
[1:13:56] I preach and you got problems
[1:14:02] on look at the early church there in the
[1:14:04] book of Acts the Bible says when the
[1:14:07] Holy Ghost had fully come and Peter then
[1:14:10] began to walk down the street and people
[1:14:12] the Bible says people begin to be
[1:14:14] healed Jesus The
[1:14:17] Impossible made possible
[1:14:25] right the Bible says the shadow of PE
[1:14:30] Peter just went
[1:14:32] over never laid hands on them come on
[1:14:35] Amen the Bible says the shadow of Peter
[1:14:39] come over them and they were healed oh
[1:14:43] but brother Tim that's Peter after all
[1:14:45] God did give him the keys to the kingdom
[1:14:47] and Tim that's
[1:14:50] you stay sick
[1:14:52] then I well I got where I tell church if
[1:14:55] they don't believe it stay sick
[1:14:57] then that's what I tell my church you
[1:14:59] don't believe it stay
[1:15:02] sick you want to go home sick go home
[1:15:05] sick you don't want to go home sick you
[1:15:07] don't have to go
[1:15:08] homesick that's
[1:15:10] right the shadow of Peter and the people
[1:15:15] got healed right amen but Sam you won't
[1:15:18] find more them boys went to prison there
[1:15:21] before they started doing the acts of
[1:15:23] God right
[1:15:26] the Bible says that begger was laying by
[1:15:27] the street Peter comes up and says s and
[1:15:30] go have we none but such as we have we
[1:15:31] give unto thee who give it to him
[1:15:35] Peter is that right then who's going to
[1:15:38] give it to people today come
[1:15:40] on Amen s go Have I None but such as I
[1:15:44] have I give unto thee amen then we find
[1:15:47] them next week after that the next week
[1:15:49] they put him in
[1:15:52] jail that's right amen because as long
[1:15:55] say the devil didn't mind them if they
[1:15:57] just went around but don't you do things
[1:15:59] like this the enemy didn't like it and
[1:16:03] when they started doing things like that
[1:16:04] out in the opening Satan rared his old
[1:16:06] hugly head that brother bam said and he
[1:16:09] had them throwed in
[1:16:11] prison same thing with you and I you
[1:16:14] think Satan cares you come to church and
[1:16:16] spend four high fires
[1:16:18] tonight n see all these empty pews Satan
[1:16:22] sitting in rest of them

[1:16:47] mind you come and sitting right here on
[1:16:48] his Pew he don't mind you getting a
[1:16:51] little excited hey man brother
[1:16:54] preach it brother glory to God brother
[1:16:57] preach it he don't mind
[1:17:00] that but when you become one with
[1:17:05] it when you begin to become one with
[1:17:08] what that word begins to say then he's
[1:17:10] going to say oh watch it now I can't
[1:17:12] have you doing that don't don't don't be
[1:17:15] this that and all of a sudden you'll get

[1:17:24] board and this down and I gu oh oh my we
[1:17:26] ain't going to have a house no clothes
[1:17:28] we w't have nothing when we get home the
[1:17:30] devil did that because you was listening
[1:17:32] for the
[1:17:33] word
[1:17:35] exactly if you can take your focus off
[1:17:37] that's what he's doing to Samson
[1:17:39] Samson's come to the place where he's
[1:17:40] took his Focus Samson knew God done all
[1:17:43] them things for him Samson knew the word
[1:17:45] of the Lord came on him he knew the
[1:17:47] power of God laid in his hair he knew
[1:17:49] all those things he knew he was a
[1:17:50] Nazarite vow he knew who he was but when
[1:17:53] Satan got him to real life and take the
[1:17:55] focus off of who did that he stood there
[1:17:58] conquered right
[1:18:02] amen same thing we do amen same thing we
[1:18:11] do the Bible says when them boys walk by
[1:18:14] Brother Sam and the shadow H them the
[1:18:16] Bible says they listen closely the Bible
[1:18:18] says they
[1:18:19] recognized they had been with Jesus amen
[1:18:23] glory to God believe
[1:18:25] they recognize somebody had been with
[1:18:32] Jesus I'm telling you friends we're
[1:18:34] going to face things in 2014 we didn't
[1:18:36] face in
[1:18:39] 2013 you going to see things in 2014 you
[1:18:42] never thought you'd see happen you wait
[1:18:44] and see if the government can get you
[1:18:47] and I dependent on them they've got us
[1:18:49] that's right they've done got it where
[1:18:50] they got the world depending on them
[1:18:52] come on yeah right don't you ever do
[1:18:54] don't you fall without that trick you
[1:18:57] depend on God amen amen exactly right
[1:19:01] let's go a little further if I all right
[1:19:04] oh it's 9:30 it ain't
[1:19:06] late now watch the difference here the
[1:19:09] days prior when they recognized they was
[1:19:11] with Jesus the days prior of the book of
[1:19:13] Acts when Peter notice what Peter was
[1:19:16] doing now I'm we'll get back to Samson
[1:19:17] but watch the early church as we just go
[1:19:19] through this days prior Brother Sam of
[1:19:22] what Peter was doing in the book of Acts
[1:19:24] the B bble says he was running around
[1:19:26] cussing and was running around
[1:19:29] naked that's right now if we message
[1:19:33] people seen him today what would we'
[1:19:35] thought about Peter right
[1:19:40] amen about jingus you ain't coming back
[1:19:42] in my
[1:19:44] church read your
[1:19:47] Bible prior of this Peter was running
[1:19:49] around naked cussing brother Ram
[1:19:52] actually called him a cussing preacher
[1:19:54] that's right right amen
[1:19:58] right but see there's one difference he
[1:20:01] was doing that before he went in the
[1:20:02] upper
[1:20:04] [Laughter]
[1:20:05] room Lo but the whole time Brother Sam
[1:20:08] when he got mad and aggravated and
[1:20:10] started that he left Jesus goes down
[1:20:13] back down to the river to a boat and
[1:20:15] throws his clothes off and we cussing
[1:20:18] right amen but prior of that who's he
[1:20:21] walking with oh yeah Jesus right amen
[1:20:24] that's
[1:20:27] amen see that's about like all those
[1:20:29] today thans just because they walk with
[1:20:31] brother Brown they fine right Peter
[1:20:33] walked with Jesus and he was still
[1:20:35] unsaved
[1:20:37] on just because we walk with brother
[1:20:39] bandam don't mean nothing oh I could say
[1:20:42] some things but I'm
[1:20:44] not just because we walk we brother B
[1:20:47] that don't make us say because Peter and
[1:20:48] James and John and walk with Jesus look
[1:20:50] what they
[1:20:51] done you wouldn't catch me running down
[1:20:54] thr my close off
[1:20:56] cussing Peter
[1:20:59] did and it wasn't long after that we
[1:21:01] find in the shadow of him going over a
[1:21:03] man and healing him sir but one
[1:21:06] difference was the Bible said they
[1:21:07] recognized he been with Jesus listen
[1:21:09] friends they was with Jesus before the
[1:21:11] upper room
[1:21:12] experience amen right before they go in
[1:21:15] the upper room they've walked with him
[1:21:17] they've talked with him they was in some
[1:21:18] of the greatest convictions
[1:21:22] ever Jesus looks at Peter and says Peter
[1:21:24] Satan's desire to sift you yes sir
[1:21:29] amen that means w Peter Satan wants you
[1:21:34] but I'm not going to let him have you
[1:21:36] but I will let him sift you right that's
[1:21:39] what Jesus said go back go the original
[1:21:40] words of what Jesus said in the original
[1:21:42] see if he didn't say
[1:21:44] that but has he been with Jesus yes did
[1:21:48] it change him no what changed him when
[1:21:51] he went in the upper room and experience
[1:21:53] happen up there yes
[1:22:00] sir so there's a big difference in just
[1:22:02] being with Jesus and knowing Jesus
[1:22:04] right but see after Peter had actually
[1:22:07] come and he come to the knowledge of who
[1:22:09] Jesus was
[1:22:11] right then brother Tim he walks down the
[1:22:14] street and people says whoa whoa now
[1:22:16] he's different yeah last week he was
[1:22:18] this this week he was this because he
[1:22:21] know he walked with Jesus but now he had
[1:22:23] come to know
[1:22:25] the knowledge of who he was amen notice
[1:22:30] Samson now spiritual food and doe season
[1:22:33] blood says oh let us turn if you want to
[1:22:34] follow the message I follow the reading
[1:22:36] he said Mark it down he says now I don't
[1:22:38] believe it would be appropriate to have
[1:22:39] a service without reading God's word and
[1:22:41] passing a few comments if it's going to
[1:22:43] be a hidden service or any kind we all
[1:22:46] understand there's no strangers Among Us
[1:22:47] I suppose but we all understand what
[1:22:49] healing is nothing that somebody does
[1:22:51] for you it's what God has already done
[1:22:54] for you Samson's on the same
[1:22:58] line he said the only thing is to get
[1:23:00] the people to believe that the to
[1:23:02] believe that's the truth God teaches it
[1:23:04] in his word and then proves it to them
[1:23:06] who believe it for for for he said all
[1:23:09] things are possible in believe you say
[1:23:11] there's nothing impossible with God you
[1:23:13] believe that there's nothing impossible
[1:23:15] with you
[1:23:16] either thank you Lord right I Wonder Why
[1:23:19] They Don't Preach that part right here
[1:23:22] what he says there's nothing impossible
[1:23:24] with God
[1:23:25] he said do you believe that then there's
[1:23:27] nothing impossible with you
[1:23:30] either he said all things are impossible
[1:23:33] to them God is one person to them that
[1:23:35] believe so there's nothing impossible to
[1:23:38] you if you would just believe it that's
[1:23:41] it amen oh we don't teach that no more
[1:23:45] though oh I ain't talked about in the
[1:23:48] message no more
[1:23:55] huh that right that ain't talked about
[1:23:58] no more you know we can't do that man we
[1:23:59] take him from Brother brownon come on

[1:24:40] angel comes to me with a revelation I
[1:24:42] take it back to the
[1:24:45] word I said let me ask you a question I
[1:24:47] said you saying brother Rams coming back

[1:25:20] the way to our day he TPS the early
[1:25:22] church was Samson amen then brother Tim

[1:25:28] that brother B was looking at in
[1:25:30] Samson's life well he's up the Old
[1:25:32] Testament brother Tim he don't really me

[1:26:33] these on this side and all of these on
[1:26:35] this side and when he comes through the
[1:26:37] gate we'll just kill him right
[1:26:41] amen oh my but their stories changed
[1:26:44] when Samson walked out and picked up the
[1:26:48] gates they had no idea Samson going to
[1:26:50] pick the gates up they knew it was a
[1:26:52] mighty man but notice brother B of types
[1:26:55] Samson with the early
[1:26:57] church don't you see the importance of
[1:27:00] what Samson doing it's something that
[1:27:02] you and I must contend with
[1:27:05] Hallelujah
[1:27:08] exactly and they come out and Samson
[1:27:11] comes out and they got in there and they
[1:27:12] it's dark and everybody in the middle of
[1:27:14] night and they don't know Sam Samson
[1:27:15] they don't think Samson knows but the
[1:27:17] thing they was missing as God was with
[1:27:18] him he comes out and he begins to grab
[1:27:21] he goes up to the gate and the Bible
[1:27:22] says he GBS the gates and the post
[1:27:29] right he grabs the gates and the post
[1:27:32] and the bars and just picks them up out
[1:27:35] of the ground brother Tim that's
[1:27:37] impossible with me and you
[1:27:42] yes yes with me and you that's
[1:27:47] right but when the anointing the Bible
[1:27:50] says the anointing came down up oh
[1:27:52] there's the difference Brother Sam
[1:27:54] listen we come to church and said here
[1:27:56] and here four and five I could preach
[1:27:57] four and five in six hours that ain't
[1:27:59] worth the nickel unless the anointing
[1:28:01] comes
[1:28:02] right it don't matter how sat don't care
[1:28:05] if I preach all night if the anointing
[1:28:07] don't come it didn't do no good say
[1:28:09] Samson walked out but what they wern't
[1:28:11] figuring on is the anointing was upon it
[1:28:14] Satan don't mind you coming but what he
[1:28:16] don't figure on if you allow that
[1:28:18] anointing to get upon you
[1:28:22] right brother Tim ask for them gone back
[1:28:24] there why why do we believe that
[1:28:26] nonsense because the devil tells us
[1:28:29] that brother we don't have to be like
[1:28:32] that no more we don't have to be like
[1:28:33] brother mam said brother M said the
[1:28:35] church today he said back then they were
[1:28:37] Pentecost and they'll be Pentecost again
[1:28:39] now when I say Pentecost listen friends
[1:28:41] let me explain what I'm saying I'm not
[1:28:43] necessarily saying jumping shouting
[1:28:45] speaking running to pews and jumping the
[1:28:46] pews and Shing out hang swinging all I'm
[1:28:49] not talking about
[1:28:50] that I preached that at my house one
[1:28:52] time and everybody well
[1:28:54] Tim thinks everybody's got to be
[1:28:56] Pentecost like Kim jumping running
[1:28:57] sweating holling screaming holling snot
[1:28:59] Tim I didn't say that that's
[1:29:10] right they wasn't figuring on the
[1:29:12] anointing of God upon him they didn't
[1:29:15] think he could come out and pull the
[1:29:16] gates and pull the post and put the bars
[1:29:18] up
[1:29:19] amen oh but when they seen that brother
[1:29:22] Tim can you imagine their eyes other day
[1:29:25] oh god what have we got ourselves into
[1:29:29] because the difference was is when the
[1:29:30] anointing stood up on Samson it wasn't
[1:29:33] Samson no more and there's the thing you
[1:29:36] got to see church when it's not you when
[1:29:38] the anointing gets on you it's
[1:29:44] Goden says oh yes when they tried to
[1:29:46] fence in the power of God see what they
[1:29:48] done there they fence in the power of
[1:29:51] God well let's let's let's fence this
[1:29:53] one area here and leave the power of God
[1:29:55] I built the church I built several
[1:29:56] churches one time and in this in this
[1:29:58] church is the United House of Prayer for
[1:30:00] all people and uh I built this church
[1:30:03] and they had right here right here is a
[1:30:04] little place and they'd have about 50
[1:30:06] foot right here what nothing but
[1:30:08] hardwood and this one area was shouting
[1:30:10] ground that's all it is you could not
[1:30:13] come in this area unless the spirit of
[1:30:15] God hit you oh I thought if we did that
[1:30:18] to a message church we never have to fix
[1:30:20] that floor because it never gets stepped
[1:30:21] on
[1:30:26] never be scarred up none because I'm
[1:30:28] going to tell you M's churches friends
[1:30:30] got where they won't worship they won't
[1:30:32] speak they won't speak in tongues no
[1:30:34] more they won't worship no more they
[1:30:35] won't cry no more they won't scream no
[1:30:37] more why because they've allowed these
[1:30:40] low down preachers to teach them that
[1:30:44] garbage you want to go back and see how
[1:30:47] the early Church in the B the Old
[1:30:48] Testament
[1:30:51] acted read the read as a read Ezra read
[1:30:55] nemiah read Zechariah and read Hagi and
[1:30:57] see how they acted right Amen brother
[1:31:00] bam called them the body of
[1:31:03] God oh brother Tim those in the old
[1:31:05] teston they're not the part of the body
[1:31:06] of God well I'm just tell what you
[1:31:08] prophecy right
[1:31:11] amen it's the same ano brother no never
[1:31:15] did change it's the same one from the
[1:31:17] Garden of Eden all way to the
[1:31:18] end but man said it just gets greater
[1:31:21] and greater and greater that's why we
[1:31:24] can honestly say friends this church
[1:31:26] this body today is greater than what
[1:31:28] they had in the early 40s and 50s and
[1:31:30] 60s brother Tim you doing away with
[1:31:32] brother Brown no I'm not listen to what
[1:31:34] brother Brown said brother Brown
[1:31:36] preached these things back there he
[1:31:37] spoke these things there why because he
[1:31:40] knew that going to be a people Brother
[1:31:41] Sam that would believe
[1:31:45] him brother B looked for the Rapture but
[1:31:49] he knew God was going to take him home
[1:31:51] oh preached his own funeral wings of a
[1:31:54] snow white dub he knew what was taking
[1:31:56] place the anointing was on him but he
[1:31:59] said you wait till them preachers them
[1:32:00] little young preachers come through he
[1:32:01] said let them break it down divide it up
[1:32:03] and feed it to the children of God he
[1:32:05] had done spoke and preached these things
[1:32:06] way back here in the 40s 50s and the
[1:32:08] early 60s 61 he start talking about
[1:32:11] bride time bride time sea time bride age
[1:32:13] bride age why because he's seen it
[1:32:15] gradually getting greater and greater
[1:32:19] Ander oh God he said there it is he said
[1:32:24] tried to fence in the power of God they
[1:32:25] found out that they couldn't do it
[1:32:27] Samson picked up those great big iron
[1:32:29] gates up that would have weighed
[1:32:32] tons walked up the hill if I'm not
[1:32:34] mistaken if you go back and look at the
[1:32:35] history the B it teaches in history that
[1:32:38] that Samson actually picked the gates
[1:32:40] picked the post and picked the bars and
[1:32:42] toted them up a hill not downhill but
[1:32:45] uphill for 12
[1:32:50] miles that's impossible for me but but
[1:32:53] it ain't for God he said he picked up
[1:32:56] them Gates walked up on the hill with
[1:32:57] them and laid them down he said
[1:32:59] certainly nobody was going to take after
[1:33:01] him he said they knew better then what
[1:33:03] do you think 40 50 guys sitting here and
[1:33:05] he picks up the gates tons brother said
[1:33:07] that way tons and tons pick them up and
[1:33:08] start to him up thing 12 miles up a hill
[1:33:11] they're standing there looking says
[1:33:13] y'all go at him y' what y'all waiting on
[1:33:15] hurry up go shoot a bow at
[1:33:17] him you see if y'all can get him well if
[1:33:19] y'all can get him down I'll come help
[1:33:22] you that's way people you go first and
[1:33:24] I'll come help
[1:33:25] you
[1:33:28] amen they knew better friends but said
[1:33:30] when a man comes listen closely friends
[1:33:32] I'm not going to hold you much longer
[1:33:34] when a man comes in the anointing of the
[1:33:36] Holy Ghost and with the word of the Lord
[1:33:39] amen uhoh hold your ters now when a man
[1:33:43] comes in the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:45] with the word of the Lord with thus s
[1:33:48] the Lord do you mean to tell me brother
[1:33:49] Tim the body can have thus say the Lord
[1:33:52] I'm just telling you what he he said
[1:33:55] right the Bible says the spirit of the
[1:33:58] Lord Came Upon Samson the anointing of
[1:34:01] God Came Upon him when he came out of
[1:34:03] the city he comes up to the gates picks
[1:34:06] them out of the ground walks 12 miles up
[1:34:08] a hill and throws them down tell me how
[1:34:11] he did
[1:34:12] it an anointing right brother M says and
[1:34:16] when that anointing comes in the on the
[1:34:19] of the Holy Ghost at the word of the
[1:34:21] Lord with thus say the Lord you better
[1:34:24] he said you better have better sense
[1:34:25] than to try to attack that so brother
[1:34:28] bam is now paralleling then thus said
[1:34:31] the Lord the anointing of God
[1:34:33] paralleling with what Samson had and did
[1:34:36] right that's why brother B said that's
[1:34:39] why they didn't attack
[1:34:44] him friends you don't have to we don't
[1:34:46] have to have
[1:34:50] fear he says you better have better
[1:34:52] sense than try to attack them then cuz
[1:34:54] you'll find there's a hand of the Living
[1:34:56] God and it's a heavy
[1:34:59] hand so he Compares Brother Sam he
[1:35:02] actually compares the body of Christ
[1:35:05] today come on with Samson of the Old
[1:35:08] Testament yes so you don't you don't
[1:35:10] come against a man if the spirit of God
[1:35:12] is on him
[1:35:14] right they found themselves in trouble
[1:35:17] then will not we do the same thing on
[1:35:20] Satan and his demons can't stand they
[1:35:23] couldn't stand the early
[1:35:25] church remember I'm said that's why they
[1:35:27] can't stand
[1:35:30] you keep in mind church it's not you
[1:35:32] doing it it's
[1:35:35] God people think that was brother Brown
[1:35:37] doing it it wasn't I tell you a meeting
[1:35:40] where brother b stands on a pool pit
[1:35:41] having a heating line brother B says now
[1:35:43] wait a minute says you ministers said
[1:35:45] come up here he called four5 it might
[1:35:47] been 20 ministers come up he said line
[1:35:49] up across the platform these ministers
[1:35:51] standing there in the middle he said
[1:35:52] start lining up and he said line them
[1:35:53] through here he said I want to this is
[1:35:55] what your Prophet said he said I want to
[1:35:57] prove to you to the congregation to the
[1:35:59] people that's listening and watching he
[1:36:01] said that it isn't
[1:36:06] me what them return people quote
[1:36:11] that I he said it I want to prove to the
[1:36:14] people that it isn't me he said now you
[1:36:16] brothers when they come through the line
[1:36:18] lay hands on them and you pray for them
[1:36:20] brother stands there right exactly
[1:36:26] amen now you see why I'm not like
[1:36:32] well of course as long as God likes me
[1:36:34] that's all that matters to
[1:36:36] me there's character after character
[1:36:39] after character in the
[1:36:41] Bible that things had come to them that
[1:36:43] brother bandam actually ties and brings
[1:36:47] and parallels I love to watch how
[1:36:49] brother Brown parallels the early church
[1:36:50] down through the Old Testament into the
[1:36:53] New Testament there we find him coming
[1:36:55] up into Paul's age in Ephesus all the
[1:36:57] way through up through the church age
[1:36:58] and brother man begins to parall and and
[1:36:59] tie all of this and goes goes back
[1:37:02] excuse me to Samson he goes back to
[1:37:04] shamard amen oh yeah because what these
[1:37:07] what these Great Men of God had he said
[1:37:10] that the body of Christ is to be exactly
[1:37:13] like them amen well brother Tim the Holy
[1:37:16] Ghost hadn't come yet I understand the
[1:37:18] Holy Ghost wasn't like we have it today
[1:37:20] in the Old
[1:37:21] Testament but you tell you said brother
[1:37:23] they didn't have Grace well tell me why
[1:37:25] in the book of Zechariah they stood
[1:37:26] there the Bible says they stood there
[1:37:28] hollering crying shouting Grace Grace
[1:37:30] Grace
[1:37:33] amen that's the Bible right but what we
[1:37:36] want to preach today and believe that
[1:37:37] they didn't have no Grace that back
[1:37:38] there oh they was all under law they
[1:37:41] couldn't see that the sa restoration of
[1:37:43] the church Brother Sam wasn't wasn't
[1:37:45] dealing with so much of the law it was
[1:37:47] God was showing said it was actually a
[1:37:50] shadow of what was
[1:37:51] coming God was coming there was law all
[1:37:54] the way through there was law when Jesus
[1:37:57] was here he said I didn't come to do
[1:37:58] away with it I come to magnify I come to
[1:38:01] make it
[1:38:03] Greater and there STS the Old Testament
[1:38:05] with all its great furnish and
[1:38:06] everything and these old and the Bible
[1:38:08] says if you look back in history you'll
[1:38:10] find when they came out of Babylon there
[1:38:12] are 70 years out of bondage there was
[1:38:14] 42,3 60 came out close to 50,000 in all
[1:38:19] but around at
[1:38:20] 7,000 got mad and GR humbled and gried
[1:38:24] and complained and the Bible says they
[1:38:26] cried aloud and bewell in
[1:38:29] lamentation
[1:38:31] am
[1:38:33] because
[1:38:36] 42360 was crying and worshiping so loud
[1:38:40] that the Bible says they heard them a
[1:38:43] far
[1:38:44] off right prise
[1:38:47] God but these 7,000 was looking for the
[1:38:50] first temple right right
[1:38:54] amen they was of the return
[1:38:58] Ministry they couldn't see what God was
[1:39:00] doing in the second restoration right
[1:39:03] all they could look back and see what
[1:39:04] would God done under the first that's
[1:39:06] why the Bible says and when God cometh
[1:39:07] the Lord the Bible says the two prophets
[1:39:09] coming the Lord prophesied through them
[1:39:11] and said the second house is greater
[1:39:13] than the first that's what the Bible
[1:39:15] says in verse n right then they couldn't
[1:39:19] understand why God would even think that
[1:39:22] because all the furniture was in it all
[1:39:23] the great things Aaron's Rod was in it
[1:39:26] the the the everything that needed was
[1:39:28] in it but see God wasn't looking at the
[1:39:30] furniture in the second house he was
[1:39:32] looking at the
[1:39:36] person Hallelujah that's what made the
[1:39:38] second house greater not not the
[1:39:41] furniture come on oh my look tell that
[1:39:44] Arc of the Covenant in that first house
[1:39:46] it was so it couldn't touch the ground
[1:39:48] it couldn't touch the back of a cow it
[1:39:50] had to be on levite shoulders it
[1:39:52] remember one time brother Sam it fell
[1:39:54] and another man jumped over and picked
[1:39:55] it up and the Bible said he killed him
[1:39:57] it was so so proper and in order and the
[1:40:00] anointing of God but now God had moved
[1:40:03] from that into another dispensation amen
[1:40:07] yes sir Oh Glory to God hallelujah and
[1:40:10] now look friends and now here stood the
[1:40:12] second temple and God said it's greater
[1:40:16] than the first on then are not we
[1:40:18] supposed to be greater than the first
[1:40:23] exactly
[1:40:25] Amen brother parallels Brother Sam
[1:40:28] shamard
[1:40:30] Samson what was the other one Gideon all
[1:40:33] these great characters of The Bible
[1:40:35] brother man parallels them shows them
[1:40:36] through the early church and how we're
[1:40:38] supposed to contend for what they had on
[1:40:41] oh Church don't take it lightly because
[1:40:43] it's just the Old Testament not
[1:40:49] right it's the power of God he was the
[1:40:52] same power that stood in the Garden of
[1:40:54] Eden
[1:40:57] right now
[1:40:59] notice if you'll run that on back you'll
[1:41:01] find
[1:41:02] out that the watch the word earnestly
[1:41:06] contend earnestly contend which is
[1:41:09] actually one word yeah Oh
[1:41:13] Glory what notice notice what brother
[1:41:16] bam was doing in all the messages that
[1:41:18] was preaching and showing shamgar and
[1:41:20] Samson and all these great people of God
[1:41:22] trying to bring the body Body of Christ
[1:41:24] today up to where they was and Brother
[1:41:26] Sam they was thousands of years ago but
[1:41:28] look what those great people of God
[1:41:32] had power friends power was with these
[1:41:36] guys right
[1:41:38] amen where's our Zeal like that where's
[1:41:41] our passion like that where's our
[1:41:44] passion that will take us back to
[1:41:46] that
[1:41:49] amen I told my church many times brother
[1:41:51] Tim will confess to it
[1:41:53] my church ever gets cold and
[1:41:55] former I can find him another
[1:41:59] preacher I'm not preaching to a cold
[1:42:01] formal dead church I refuse to do it
[1:42:04] come
[1:42:08] on so far we've helded it together
[1:42:10] pretty good a't with him for 13 years
[1:42:13] bless why you got to preach that you got
[1:42:16] to show the people the the manifestation
[1:42:18] of the message right and then brother B
[1:42:21] will take us back and show us how it was
[1:42:22] V Vindicated back there yeah and then he
[1:42:25] brings it up brother Sam and shows us
[1:42:27] that it's Vindicated today even in his
[1:42:30] ministry said he Vindicated who the
[1:42:32] prophet was he Vindicated what he was
[1:42:34] saying but listen friends the
[1:42:35] Vindication didn't stop back there we
[1:42:38] are also Vindicated of the Lord as a
[1:42:42] body of Jesus Christ with the word that
[1:42:44] they had is the same word today amen yes
[1:42:49] sir
[1:42:51] what see what happened to Sam
[1:42:54] he compromised with the
[1:42:57] world laid his head in the lap of a
[1:42:59] woman right yes sir Sams and the
[1:43:02] Philistines are upon me and he jumps up
[1:43:06] and his locks are
[1:43:08] cut let me hurry but we see him standing
[1:43:10] when he says lead me to this the main
[1:43:14] post what they couldn't see Brother Sam
[1:43:17] when they put him in the lockup and
[1:43:18] Delila would comes daily to see him and
[1:43:21] he's on the grinding wheel and the Bible
[1:43:24] says he's pushing the grinding wheel
[1:43:25] around and around and around and his
[1:43:28] eyes are put out and he's
[1:43:30] blind but what they couldn't see a
[1:43:34] little bit of it hair
[1:43:35] grow and Samson could feel it cuz he
[1:43:38] doesn't seen a vision of coming back
[1:43:40] read watch said it said Samson had a
[1:43:43] vision of coming to back what he first
[1:43:45] had
[1:43:47] exactly and he'd go by another day and
[1:43:49] another week would go by another month
[1:43:51] maybe would go by whatever the time
[1:43:53] limit was and it was growing but see
[1:43:55] they thought they had him and they
[1:43:57] couldn't see it and then grow back
[1:44:00] because it was a Nazarite vow right and

[1:44:17] for let me feel that once
[1:44:21] more shouldn't that be what the body
[1:44:23] screaming for today we as a Church of
[1:44:25] Jesus Christ friends we should be
[1:44:27] screaming and shouting come quickly Lord
[1:44:29] Lord why don't you come quickly Lord
[1:44:31] come quickly look for it every moment of
[1:44:33] your life right

[1:44:40] close he lost everything Brother Sam he
[1:44:43] lost
[1:44:46] everything said oh what he oh what must
[1:44:49] have went through through his mind right
[1:44:52] he says
[1:44:53] seeing what them Philistines standing
[1:44:56] there they knowed
[1:44:58] him he said when I've heard one reach
[1:45:01] over to another and say I remember the
[1:45:03] time he said Philistines was saying this
[1:45:06] to each other I remember a time when you
[1:45:08] would say Samson and everybody would run
[1:45:11] to rats like a
[1:45:14] hole he said I've heard the time you'd
[1:45:16] say a thousand men would be marching
[1:45:17] across the excuse me the desert and then
[1:45:19] say Samson's coming they drop their arms
[1:45:22] and run for sat as hard as they could
[1:45:25] amen one man
[1:45:27] right I'm tell you brother say I'm going
[1:45:29] tell you what's happened that gets old
[1:45:32] to the people oh yeah C it's four five
[1:45:34] 6,000 years old but me tell you God
[1:45:37] didn't allow this to happen for nothing
[1:45:39] God didn't allow this to happen just to
[1:45:41] keep it in the pages of the Bible when
[1:45:43] the very Bible says Paul says it
[1:45:45] shouldn't been read he said we don't
[1:45:46] want it to just be ink from pens up on
[1:45:49] paper right oh friends we can read that
[1:45:51] good in the New Testament we can
[1:45:53] especially these messages we can read
[1:45:55] that real good but what we don't do we
[1:45:56] don't go back to where we talking about
[1:45:58] what brother man paralleled from the Old
[1:46:00] Testament and see that Paul was talking
[1:46:02] about that also he said they'd run like
[1:46:05] rats in a hole he said I heard one time
[1:46:07] where you'd say a thousand men he said
[1:46:09] and Samson's coming they would run for
[1:46:11] safety he said but now look at him oh
[1:46:13] he's in a terrible condition he's bound
[1:46:15] oh because he compromised with a woman
[1:46:19] that's what he's done she stripped him
[1:46:21] of his power she kept trying to find
[1:46:23] where his strength laid she knowed he
[1:46:24] was a big man but they had big men too
[1:46:28] but this Delilah she was a real Jezebel
[1:46:32] she knowed how to work on him to woo him
[1:46:34] to her and say that he how she loved him
[1:46:36] but all the time she was trying to fish
[1:46:38] along where his strength
[1:46:41] laid and that's the same thing that
[1:46:43] Jezebel has done to the church yes sir
[1:46:46] there he is again paralleling that
[1:46:48] message right amen he said Jezebel's
[1:46:50] done the same thing to the church he's
[1:46:53] now remember if you read the brother
[1:46:54] Brown's messages he's where in 63 now
[1:46:57] brother Brown is the church the church
[1:46:58] the church now right after here brother

[1:47:01] her the body amen amen he go right into
[1:47:04] calling her the bride amen used to be
[1:47:06] the church but they wouldn't go with the
[1:47:08] word he said that's where you
[1:47:09] Pentecostals fail he said when the word

[1:47:48] laid to the church he said she fished
[1:47:50] see she find out where strength laid he
[1:47:51] said and if it's the the strength in the
[1:47:53] word the word is God finally she found
[1:47:55] where the strength laid she took him
[1:47:57] down to n of Rome and shaved off his
[1:48:00] locks yeah right you see how brother

[1:48:34] Miracles are P oh there's no such a
[1:48:35] thing as this or that and the other they
[1:48:37] found where their strength laid
[1:48:38] substituting baptism and handshakes and
[1:48:40] other things for the true unadulterated
[1:48:43] power of God Amen yes sir
[1:48:46] Glory listen this small one this word is
[1:48:49] God that was given to his church to to
[1:48:52] defeat the world and the devils and
[1:48:55] sicknesses to cast out devils and no
[1:48:57] denomination was given to the
[1:48:59] church on the word was give to the
[1:49:02] church that was her strength but they
[1:49:05] cut this away and cut that away and cut

[1:49:31] didn't come in 213 you know who knows he
[1:49:35] he might not even come the Bible says in
[1:49:37] Matthew They delayed he delayed his
[1:49:38] coming look what they done right amen
[1:49:41] don't don't don't do that don't be as
[1:49:44] the early church today I'm talking about
[1:49:45] the early church as we know it in our
[1:49:47] time don't be as them be as this early
[1:49:50] church read Dan read Samuel Kings what
[1:49:53] David begin to do for the Lord theam
[1:49:55] goes back and parallels the body of
[1:49:57] Christ just hit it real quickly he goes
[1:49:59] back and parallels the body of Christ
[1:50:01] back to David that early church see but
[1:50:04] most people look at the early church
[1:50:06] brother Tim and they see the early
[1:50:07] church was just in our day they're not
[1:50:09] looking back to
[1:50:10] thisen Jud one says contend for the
[1:50:13] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:50:14] Saints that's right amen
[1:50:19] oh I like this Brother Sam they couldn't
[1:50:23] see it and Samson was going around and
[1:50:25] around and around and all they done was
[1:50:27] shaved it now yeah is that right Bible
[1:50:29] said they shaved his head cut his eyes
[1:50:32] out and put him in the dungeon he's
[1:50:34] going around and around brother Tim this
[1:50:35] is what I like brother M said actually
[1:50:38] he said there in the church ages he said
[1:50:39] they thought they killed it out he said
[1:50:41] they tried to burn it out snuff it out
[1:50:43] hang it out and do all these things he
[1:50:44] said but they couldn't amen he takes it
[1:50:46] back to sson he hear Samson going around
[1:50:48] and around and around and around that
[1:50:50] dungeon his hair is beginning to grow
[1:50:52] you know where they made their fatal
[1:50:53] mistake what they didn't kill the
[1:50:58] roots
[1:51:00] right they thought they didn't think
[1:51:02] just because they thought because they
[1:51:03] shaved it it wasn't coming back but they
[1:51:05] didn't kill the roots and when it
[1:51:08] started growing his strength was coming
[1:51:11] back because he was a Nazarite
[1:51:14] vow glory to God Amen that's why brother
[1:51:17] said they tried to kill it out burn it
[1:51:18] out snuff it out put Peter Peter said
[1:51:20] hang him upside down put John I think it
[1:51:22] was John was in bowl a hot ball and all
[1:51:24] couldn't burn it out of him but M said
[1:51:25] see they can't kill the roots he said
[1:51:28] sure down through the church ages we see
[1:51:30] it y'all see it where it got darker and
[1:51:32] darker and darker didn't get a little
[1:51:33] bit of light says God gave him the
[1:51:35] privilege to give a little bit of light
[1:51:37] then it shows the eighth little moon
[1:51:39] right there in his total darkness
[1:51:40] remember that right that little light
[1:51:43] that brother said God allowed him to put
[1:51:45] in the reason it did they couldn't kill
[1:51:48] the roots amen they were still Sons and
[1:51:51] Daughters of God on the Earth
[1:51:53] amen still Sons and Daughters of God on
[1:51:56] the earth do you love
[1:51:59] him oh my there's so much I tell you get
[1:52:03] started you want to preach the whole
[1:52:04] thing my it's just wonderful though it's
[1:52:07] just so good to to hear how God done
[1:52:10] these great people of God let me read
[1:52:12] you a couple little small quotes if you
[1:52:13] don't mind then we'll we we we I'll call
[1:52:15] Brother Sam back up brother M said the
[1:52:18] the word was given to the church to
[1:52:19] defeat the world I didn't read that let
[1:52:20] me just lay that into the side he say
[1:52:22] the great Victor that we can point back
[1:52:24] to the days gone by in the Reformation
[1:52:26] he said back in the days of ireneus St
[1:52:28] Martin Patrick and all those great
[1:52:30] though great he said when Luther came
[1:52:31] out protested the First Church Catholic
[1:52:33] Church there and the group followed him
[1:52:34] right come back organized behind him and
[1:52:36] John Wesley came out of angelism soon as
[1:52:38] Wes left there organized he said the
[1:52:40] early Pentecostal Church come out of
[1:52:41] denominations that was the cursed word
[1:52:44] to you so what he says he said but as a
[1:52:47] dog goes back to its vomits a s to its
[1:52:49] wall he said you've went right back to
[1:52:51] the things were born to
[1:52:55] defeat sir he goes right in this this is
[1:52:57] the same message just once more Lord he
[1:52:59] preached just once more Lord in another
[1:53:01] message called once more out of these
[1:53:03] two messages brother B points the body
[1:53:05] brother Tim and the church back to the
[1:53:07] early church and speaks of all of these
[1:53:09] things and I've got several more that
[1:53:10] I'm not even going to have time to read
[1:53:12] but he's pointing it back to what they
[1:53:14] had that's how much power them guys had
[1:53:18] back he says in you Pentecostals you
[1:53:20] went right back to the thing that you
[1:53:22] were born to defeat he said all that
[1:53:24] hurts my
[1:53:27] heart he said that hurts my heart even
[1:53:30] more than to think of the victory
[1:53:32] younger that deeon had over Samson I see
[1:53:34] what Jezebel's got over the church
[1:53:36] that's the reason that every strength
[1:53:38] and every fiber in my being I'm trying
[1:53:39] to protest that thing and call back that
[1:53:42] church to her place of repentance your
[1:53:44] mothers your fathers you're oued out of
[1:53:46] those denominations your organizations
[1:53:48] they come out of it protested it and
[1:53:50] here their children has turned right
[1:53:51] back around and went right back into the
[1:53:53] thing they' come out of if it ain't the
[1:53:56] same picture of
[1:53:59] Samson oh I got many I got many many

[2:10:01] sure you tell our brother how much you
[2:10:02] appreciate it but we believe what he
[2:10:04] preached amen I don't believe that God
[2:10:07] died when the prophet
[2:10:09] died I believe the prophet had to
[2:10:12] die to where the power could come in the
[2:10:16] people because the people had their mind
[2:10:19] on him they had their eyes looking at to
[2:10:22] man instead of looking to the God so he
[2:10:25] had to get off the scene he said there
[2:10:27] can't be two of us here the same
[2:10:31] time come on you see it's rant
[2:10:34] word if you as he said about it you know
[2:10:38] lay out everything said give me the
[2:10:41] scripture that's what I was thinking
[2:10:43] about you know people believe we were
[2:10:45] taught all of our Lives we were going to
[2:10:46] get a new
[2:10:47] body I want scripture for it you said
[2:10:51] well I got just yeah but just remember
[2:10:54] Jesus raised and had nail prints in his
[2:10:59] hand did he get another
[2:11:02] body or was it the same body
[2:11:06] glorified see that the scriptures right
[2:11:10] we don't have to worry about it right
[2:11:12] okay all right you can be seated make
[2:11:14] sure you tell her brother how much you
[2:11:16] appreciate it and you know
[2:11:24] you will we'll get around just let them
[2:11:25] sing but we've got about an hour and a
[2:11:28] half now and we're going to just worship
[2:11:31] have a good
[2:11:32] time and just let the Lord lead us into
[2:11:35] what to to do and for the time and then
[2:11:37] we'll take the communion right on the
[2:11:40] stroke of
[2:11:41] midnight to finish up the year I'm
[2:11:43] really looking forward to next year amen
[2:11:46] amen I do every year I look forward
[2:11:48] because I know every minute I go that
[2:11:51] way way every second I go that's one
[2:11:53] second
[2:11:55] closer to seeing my
[2:11:57] master one second closer
[2:12:00] to change of these bodies one second
[2:12:03] closer to a
[2:12:05] Rapture amen go is right there in the
[2:12:07] word all we got to do is just keep
[2:12:10] walking you know and it's just one step
[2:12:12] at a time right don't try to run and do
[2:12:15] too much just walk
[2:12:17] along you we're not discouraged
[2:12:22] pred because we're here at all this time
[2:12:26] why because the word told
[2:12:30] us I stood right here in
[2:12:33] 1974 and you know it I said we can pass
[2:12:36] the year
[2:12:39] 2026 and not change brother bram's
[2:12:42] message nor the Bible but people don't
[2:12:45] want to hear
[2:12:47] that but I said it and I believe
[2:12:53] cuz everybody thinks brother Brandon
[2:12:54] made this prediction but he said I
[2:12:56] didn't do
[2:12:57] that he said you say what I
[2:13:01] said yep it's got to be over in 77 what
[2:13:04] everybody thought he didn't say that he
[2:13:07] said don't you say that I said
[2:13:11] that because see the word is true and
[2:13:15] it'll take care of the whole thing so
[2:13:18] I'm
[2:13:19] happy the father we go the more people
[2:13:22] will fall
[2:13:23] away amen right you know what that makes
[2:13:27] it where the scriptures right fear not

[2:18:20] never seen anything like it it's about
[2:18:22] that long about that big a round and
[2:18:24] it's got about six different keys in it
[2:18:27] on the harmonica and he bought it when
[2:18:29] he was in Germany it's very old the box
[2:18:32] it was in just torn up well he was at
[2:18:35] Eng Les the other day and he had to go
[2:18:37] to the bathroom real bad and he just got
[2:18:40] out of his car and ran into the
[2:18:41] drugstore when he came back somebody had
[2:18:44] taken the thing out of the front seat of
[2:18:46] his car he forgot to lock he literally
[2:18:49] cried this poor old man he goes around
[2:18:51] to Veterans and he plays for the
[2:18:53] veterans and anybody that he's just a
[2:18:56] good Christian old man and I told him
[2:18:58] about brother collie about how we prayed
[2:19:00] and the man brought brother col's gun
[2:19:02] back and I and you know I want I wanted
[2:19:06] I could see he was trying to believe
[2:19:08] that that could happen but he just
[2:19:10] couldn't quite grab hold of it you know
[2:19:13] so just pray that that H Monica will
[2:19:15] come back to that poor old man amen
[2:19:17] because it means so much to those
[2:19:19] elderly people that we go in and sing
[2:19:21] and play for him and he he's just he he
[2:19:24] even won a contest I think he won second
[2:19:26] or third place so he's pretty good so
[2:19:29] but he was trying to take these little
[2:19:31] bitty harmonicas and and sing play with
[2:19:34] them and it took a lot of time for him
[2:19:36] to switch Keys whereas the other one he
[2:19:38] could just roll it around so I know the
[2:19:40] Lord's going to bring that
[2:19:42] back I believe it sir sister sitting
[2:19:46] back
[2:19:48] here somebody sto her pocket book we
[2:19:52] pray it came

[2:20:00] things are possible oh we yeah we
[2:20:02] believe all things are possible with God
[2:20:05] but the Bible says all things are
[2:20:07] possible to them that
[2:20:08] believe we know it will work with
[2:20:12] God but what about us who'll be next

[2:31:25] little more he was sitting out in front
[2:31:28] of a
[2:31:31] church in a wheelchair wrapped up in a
[2:31:35] blanket I thought
[2:31:38] Lord I got to go lay hands on that

[2:32:03] it I never told him
[2:32:08] that see he's here with us
[2:32:11] now might healthy cuz we believe brother
[2:32:16] Timothy I believe this Prophet brought
[2:32:18] the message
[2:32:20] amen who's next who's supposed to sing
[2:32:22] come
[2:32:23] on you see what the difference is this
[2:32:26] is my wife's favorite
[2:32:29] saying it wasn't the
[2:32:32] spirit wasn't took away in the
[2:32:36] ages that's where people are wrong it
[2:32:38] wasn't the holy spirit that was took
[2:32:39] away in the age you can't take the Holy
[2:32:41] Spirit the prophet said it was the Holy
[2:32:43] Ghost in every
[2:32:44] age it was the
[2:32:46] word that was took away
[2:32:50] we see with the restoration of the word
[2:32:52] comes what restoration of power so why
[2:32:56] can't we expect to see healings and
[2:32:58] signs and what come on
[2:33:00] brother why can't we expect to see
[2:33:04] it I I feel bad if I lay my hands on you
[2:33:07] or speak to you and you know and you're
[2:33:10] not well that's when I feel
[2:33:13] bad cuz I know it's real goe

[2:33:45] testimony while he try while we're
[2:33:47] getting that together uh

[2:34:02] standing literally at the bottom of a
[2:34:04] lake for for much as we can figure six
[2:34:08] or seven minutes or maybe a little
[2:34:10] longer I don't know exactly how long it
[2:34:13] was but I I noticed something the Pastor
[2:34:17] said the minister said earlier
[2:34:21] before I got there I had what I needed
[2:34:24] to get out of there and that was the
[2:34:27] that's the main thing in in uh in the my
[2:34:31] experience with Christ
[2:34:33] is by his grace and mercy he's always
[2:34:37] been there before I got to in the

[2:51:49] ask the boys to come help me sing guess
[2:51:51] yall can hear
[2:51:52] me eat microphone
[2:52:00] okay okay and sometimes I don't say a
[2:52:03] lot but um the Lord's
[2:52:05] been keeps putting things on my heart
[2:52:08] you know so I can talk and um I just
[2:52:11] want to say a few things of things that
[2:52:13] have happened
[2:52:15] um um to me and I thank God um for for
[2:52:19] his grace and mercy one time um the the
[2:52:24] the day that brother Ryan and sister
[2:52:26] Gabby came I know they're not here today
[2:52:29] we I was driving up the road and
[2:52:32] something said to me you could have to
[2:52:34] find somewhere to sit I'm like no I
[2:52:37] don't it's not Wednesday sister you know
[2:52:40] brother Ryan and sister Gabby they come
[2:52:41] on Wednesdays and they sit they used to
[2:52:43] sit back there where we used to sit I'm
[2:52:45] like it's not Wednesday it's Sunday and
[2:52:47] I just forgot about it when I came to
[2:52:49] church they were sitting right there and
[2:52:52] I had to find somewhere to sit and some
[2:52:54] of those things I mean that was just
[2:52:55] something that's been on my heart for a
[2:52:56] long time to testify about but sometimes
[2:52:59] I look at myself like real small and you
[2:53:01] know nothing but the Lord I think he
[2:53:04] shows me things so he knows you know so
[2:53:08] I know that he is there for me and I
[2:53:11] have no doubt in my mind that the lord
[2:53:13] loves me and he guides me and if I had
[2:53:16] known what 2013 was going to be I was
[2:53:18] going to I said Lord wait a minute let
[2:53:20] me get ready but he led me through the
[2:53:23] whole year and one of the things even
[2:53:25] though it's hard for me but it's easy
[2:53:28] for me to do at the same time is tithing
[2:53:31] and um in February this past year I had
[2:53:36] believe it or not I had more money this
[2:53:39] one week in my account than I had given
[2:53:41] the whole year and I cannot tell you how
[2:53:44] it happened I cannot tell you where the
[2:53:45] money came from but I I just said Lord
[2:53:48] what are you doing and I believe he was
[2:53:50] doing it to show me you know and not
[2:53:53] necessarily just you know to do but it
[2:53:55] it just something that was like a
[2:53:58] confirmation for me something that was
[2:54:01] secret to say and I said well Lord
[2:54:02] where's all this coming from but it just
[2:54:04] so happened that the whole amount it was
[2:54:06] more than I had given I said Lord I
[2:54:08] don't know what you're doing but it just
[2:54:09] was some confirmation to me that even
[2:54:11] though like I say it's hard but it's
[2:54:13] easy it is something that the Lord
[2:54:15] really um you know guides Us in and you
[2:54:18] know like tell like I tell people I'm
[2:54:20] not intelligent by any means of the
[2:54:22] imagination but the Lord has guided us
[2:54:24] and really led us um through our lives
[2:54:28] and one of the biggest things that
[2:54:29] happened to me this year was in May and
[2:54:31] brother Dale was preaching on marriage
[2:54:33] and divorce and sometimes you know I
[2:54:36] mean whether you know it or not
[2:54:37] sometimes that's a series that really
[2:54:39] touches me because it's personal to me
[2:54:41] and I always try to say okay the end of
[2:54:43] it you know just hold yourself together
[2:54:44] hold yourself together don't break down
[2:54:46] but then he was preaching one time and
[2:54:49] he was talking about how that uh divorce
[2:54:53] was not
[2:54:54] blasphemy and when he said he probably
[2:54:56] say that a lot of times you know it's
[2:54:58] not a good thing and all that and I'm
[2:55:00] just in my situation because I'm in a
[2:55:02] situation but when he say that it's like
[2:55:05] something just lifted I mean I just felt
[2:55:08] so free and I said he better not say
[2:55:10] that again cuz I want to jump up and
[2:55:12] shout and then he said the second time I
[2:55:15] said oh Lord you want not say that and
[2:55:17] he said the third time I just clapped I
[2:55:19] mean people probably don't remember it
[2:55:20] but I just felt so free and so able to
[2:55:25] receive what God has for me in his word
[2:55:28] because I felt like I was a denomination
[2:55:31] in myself and I had bound myself and I
[2:55:33] couldn't receive the word from the Lord
[2:55:36] and I couldn't receive His blessings
[2:55:38] because I had put myself in this cage
[2:55:40] about you know who I was and what I had
[2:55:42] become but the Lord when he said that I
[2:55:44] mean it's like you know he talks about
[2:55:47] the 49th and to me I was going that
[2:55:49] helped me going to my 50th I mean
[2:55:51] spiritually emotionally I mean
[2:55:54] financially because the Lord just opened
[2:55:56] that for me and you may not see it but
[2:55:58] Lord is changing me and he's
[2:56:00] strengthening me in my personality and
[2:56:03] in just in my walk with him and
[2:56:06] sometimes when I come up I say Lord I
[2:56:07] just want you to meet me in your word
[2:56:10] and you know like the brother was saying
[2:56:12] some the devil just shows you all the
[2:56:14] negative but there's so much impossible
[2:56:16] that God does all the time
[2:56:19] and um even last past Sunday it was like
[2:56:22] when Brother D was preaching about that
[2:56:24] the seed and the word to me it was like
[2:56:27] you know when God um you know evaporates
[2:56:29] all that water it's like was such a big
[2:56:31] message because every Sunday I'm coming
[2:56:34] here to listen to the foolishness of the
[2:56:37] preaching of the word so he can let me
[2:56:40] free you know so I really but like you
[2:56:43] was saying that you have to be ready
[2:56:45] because it's just not the word it's the
[2:56:46] spirit in life just being taught Tau
[2:56:48] thought but you have to you know have
[2:56:51] that to meet that word as well and I I'm
[2:56:53] not explaining it right but that's just
[2:56:56] what the Lord has been showing to me
[2:56:58] because even though in my pain in my
[2:57:01] hardship I mean the Lord if he's there
[2:57:04] it's just so much lighter and I know
[2:57:06] it's very confusing it's like a paradox
[2:57:09] that even though it's hard and painful
[2:57:12] it's joyful at the same time because I
[2:57:14] see that word and then my brother so
[2:57:16] many things have happened I'm just going
[2:57:18] to just a little bit more when brother
[2:57:20] um Bob and brother Aaron were preaching
[2:57:23] I think end of
[2:57:24] October and brother Bob was talking
[2:57:26] about cuz um we've been looking for a
[2:57:28] place to stay for about a year now and
[2:57:31] you know we've looked everywhere and you
[2:57:33] know trying to consolid day with the
[2:57:34] family and then brother Bob was saying
[2:57:37] that um he said uh he laid on his face
[2:57:39] for two weeks asking God for a place to
[2:57:43] stay and then I said to myself Lord if
[2:57:46] you could do it for brother Bob you can
[2:57:48] do it for me and then I mean I'm telling
[2:57:51] you that week and we had we had had a
[2:57:53] rough rough weekend I we had we had come
[2:57:55] to the depth of the depths but then that
[2:57:58] week I was um Friday I think was Friday
[2:58:01] and I was working from home and I was
[2:58:02] listening to music but sometimes the
[2:58:04] devil get you into I just bought that
[2:58:06] you just have to have something on just
[2:58:07] to you know get your mind off things and
[2:58:10] I was just picked up the paper and I
[2:58:13] opened the sports page and I never never
[2:58:15] read the sports page there's nothing for
[2:58:16] me to read I don't understand it and
[2:58:18] there was this house there was this
[2:58:19] house for sale uh for by owner and then
[2:58:23] I called her oh can I come see you you
[2:58:25] know we talked and she she you know she
[2:58:27] showed me her house and everything and
[2:58:29] just to cut a long story short the Lord
[2:58:31] just worked everything out so much that
[2:58:34] even though we wenten the real estate
[2:58:35] agent the loan officer said oh no they
[2:58:37] won't take the offer the real estate
[2:58:39] agent said they won't take the offer but
[2:58:41] she the seller herself said she told her
[2:58:45] husband she said you know what the Lord
[2:58:47] is in this leave it alone and everything
[2:58:51] I've never been through such a smooth
[2:58:52] closing I mean I've never and I believe
[2:58:54] the Lord has done this and he's the one
[2:58:57] who's going to provide because I mean it
[2:58:59] just it's like I was walking in this in
[2:59:02] this in this Faith I've never really
[2:59:04] been able to experience that but I was
[2:59:06] just walking in faith you know things
[2:59:08] were hard and everything but I was just
[2:59:10] walking in this realm of Faith ever
[2:59:12] since he had said that and there was
[2:59:14] something else that brother Erin had
[2:59:15] brought out about going through the same
[2:59:18] Mountain you know going around and
[2:59:20] around sometimes they probably don't
[2:59:21] even know they say that and then the
[2:59:23] lord gave me some Backbone in a certain
[2:59:26] situation and I know I've shared with
[2:59:28] some of them and I believe uh I think I
[2:59:30] had to come to that on my own to stop
[2:59:33] that going around the mountain I had to
[2:59:36] you know like the brother saying he does
[2:59:38] it but you have to be in a place that he
[2:59:41] can do it in you but he's doing it and I
[2:59:44] really thank the Lord for you know
[2:59:45] strengthening me and continuing to give
[2:59:47] me a backb
[2:59:49] and you know maybe it takes long long
[2:59:51] time or telling the kids I've been
[2:59:52] coming up for 20 years but maybe it does
[2:59:54] take that long it does take you know
[2:59:56] continually hearing the message
[2:59:58] continually you know just just sitting
[3:00:01] under it and so you can come to a place
[3:00:03] so you can be ready so you can get rid
[3:00:04] of your own denominational ideas and I
[3:00:07] just wanted to thank my pastor because
[3:00:09] one time I was reading in second Timothy
[3:00:13] 2 uh chapter 2: 24 and it said the
[3:00:16] servant and the servant of the Lord Lord
[3:00:18] must not strive but be gentle unto all
[3:00:21] men apt to teach patient in meekness
[3:00:24] instructing those that oppose themselves
[3:00:26] if God pervent will give them repentance
[3:00:29] to the acknowledging of the truth in
[3:00:32] that they may recover themselves out of
[3:00:34] the snare of the devil who are taken
[3:00:37] captive by him at his will and I see
[3:00:39] myself around those persons that oppose
[3:00:42] themselves and you know sometimes I do
[3:00:44] things you know people will shake their
[3:00:46] heads at me at all the time but I
[3:00:48] believe you know even brother Dale
[3:00:49] probably does some he doesn't say but
[3:00:51] he's patient and a lot of people cuz I
[3:00:54] am hard-headed and I am stubborn but I
[3:00:57] believe brother Dale is put in my path
[3:00:59] even though sometimes I try to oppose
[3:01:01] myself he comes so that you know I may
[3:01:04] recover myself at the snare of the devil
[3:01:06] and I just keep praying that the Lord
[3:01:08] give me more wisdom and give me you know
[3:01:11] the strength to carry on for the 2014
[3:01:14] and you know raise my children and be a
[3:01:16] witness to others in my my workplace and
[3:01:18] a lot of places and I just thank him for
[3:01:20] that so Bo come we're just going to sing
[3:01:22] a little song but I had to

[3:30:24] messing
[3:30:28] people amen more I want to give more of
[3:30:31] a testimony than I'm saying but uh today
[3:30:36] I was talking to a friend of mine and I
[3:30:39] was telling her you know how that I came
[3:30:42] to this message you know and I said well
[3:30:45] you know know working now and brother
[3:30:49] Dell and some other people were having a
[3:30:52] service I told I said you know I just
[3:30:55] accidentally bumped into brother Dale
[3:30:58] then I thought you know I didn't
[3:31:00] actually bump into him that God is in
[3:31:04] God's plan that I meet him and we became
[3:31:09] together you know and as we worked he
[3:31:12] worked downstairs and I worked upstairs
[3:31:16] and a lots of time he had a lots of free
[3:31:19] time where he could leave his job and
[3:31:21] come up and talk with me and tell me
[3:31:23] more about the word of God and so that's
[3:31:26] how that's how I came in I'm not going
[3:31:28] all through all of it take too much too
[3:31:31] long one other thing I want to say I
[3:31:33] want to say about the gun that I had
[3:31:36] that got
[3:31:37] stolen I was telling my neighbor that my
[3:31:41] gun had got stolen so they said well
[3:31:46] uh this man called me and told me said
[3:31:49] well I have the gun I know where it is
[3:31:54] and it I promis the person that got it
[3:31:57] if you won't turn him to the police that
[3:31:59] I bring it back to you so I said well
[3:32:02] bring on back I won't I won't prosecute
[3:32:05] him I won't try to find out who he was
[3:32:07] or how that he stole it but he brought
[3:32:10] it back you know but this all the same
[3:32:13] time everybody was praying so God were
[3:32:16] working on those people that had the gun
[3:32:19] at the same time we were praying so he
[3:32:21] brought it back you know and it's it's a
[3:32:22] great thing that God does things for us
[3:32:26] that we don't realize that he's doing if
[3:32:28] we just ask and keep believing he'll
[3:32:30] bring that to us that's right and one
[3:32:34] other thing I want to say this year it's
[3:32:37] been a a good year and a bad year but
[3:32:41] one thing I thought
[3:32:43] about of all the things that I've had
[3:32:46] people to steal from me lie to me you
[3:32:51] know do different things but I been the
[3:32:55] scripture I was reading I want to read
[3:32:57] just a verse in a minute but you know I
[3:33:01] learn through this year is to
[3:33:05] not hate people for what they done to me
[3:33:08] that's right not
[3:33:10] feel bad about
[3:33:13] people not to feel angry towards them
[3:33:15] them because Jesus Christ didn't do that
[3:33:19] way and if we if we follow Jesus Christ
[3:33:22] then we got the same thing that he had
[3:33:25] he loved those that hated him those that
[3:33:27] persecuted him and so that's the way we
[3:33:29] supposed to be we supposed to continue
[3:33:31] to love so I don't have I I learned that
[3:33:34] this year I shouldn't hate anybody it's
[3:33:37] not up to me how people feel about me
[3:33:40] but it's up to me how I feel about them

[3:34:47] y'all y'all keep talking about all this
[3:34:49] stuff coming back so I had
[3:34:51] to say this um for the glory of the Lord
[3:34:55] um back in July I'll be quick um back in
[3:34:58] July hope and I went to Savannah
[3:35:01] vacation so that Sunday morning we went
[3:35:03] by Brother Jason Watkins Church um for
[3:35:06] Sunday morning service well y'all all
[3:35:08] know how I am capable of losing
[3:35:11] things well I got home and I had no
[3:35:15] Bible
[3:35:16] so I just knew I'd left it at that
[3:35:18] church I mean I was you know I knew I
[3:35:21] had well but Danny says are you sure you
[3:35:23] left it there I said well yeah I did but
[3:35:26] you know I stopped several places on the
[3:35:28] way home and all like that so I really I
[3:35:32] wanted my Bible though and of course you
[3:35:33] know I keep things forever so it's an
[3:35:35] old dilapidated Bible with a lot of
[3:35:38] stuff in it but um so we knew somebody
[3:35:42] there so you know hope called and he was
[3:35:45] going to be at church on Wednesday night
[3:35:47] this guy from Johnson City and so I knew
[3:35:49] that could get to me through Isaac so
[3:35:52] they called him and he looked on
[3:35:54] Wednesday night he knew where was
[3:35:55] sitting my the Bible wasn't there um so
[3:35:59] and the I happen to know the lady that
[3:36:00] cleans the church so hope talked to her
[3:36:04] daughter and she says well when I clean
[3:36:05] the church I'm sure I'll find it well
[3:36:08] still didn't find the Bible I still felt
[3:36:11] like the Bible was there but several
[3:36:12] months go on and when and so I started
[3:36:15] Mother's Bible and things would go on
[3:36:18] you know in church and I'd want to write
[3:36:19] it down and I finally started writing
[3:36:21] her Bible cuz I thought my Bible wasn't
[3:36:24] coming back you know I really felt you
[3:36:26] know as much go on and so then Wednesday
[3:36:31] night when Wade preached a couple weeks
[3:36:34] ago he said something I go I got to
[3:36:36] listen to the tape now to remember what
[3:36:38] it was I can't remember because I
[3:36:40] thought Lord I've got to have my Bible
[3:36:42] to write that in my Bible I've got to
[3:36:44] have it so see you know all along I had
[3:36:48] to claim it because then I was thinking
[3:36:52] in church of course you know I was
[3:36:54] guilty I thought now Jacob's going to
[3:36:57] Charleston tomorrow my son he's going to
[3:36:59] Charleston so I could get sister Anita
[3:37:01] to meet him on the on the interstate and
[3:37:04] give me get my Bible to me though I
[3:37:07] haven't talked to her and they haven't
[3:37:08] sent me my Bible or nothing they knew I
[3:37:10] was looking for it so then I thought
[3:37:12] well no I won't do that then I said well
[3:37:15] I've got the the number for FedEx I'll
[3:37:16] just call FedEx and I'll just mail them
[3:37:18] a package and they can send my Bible
[3:37:22] back so then you know it's Christmas so
[3:37:25] then the next night I come up through
[3:37:28] the garage into the house and hope comes
[3:37:30] through the front door and she says
[3:37:33] here's a package is it mine and I says I
[3:37:36] ordered her something from Amazon and I
[3:37:38] thought oh I've collected twice I've
[3:37:40] ordered cuz that came the day
[3:37:42] before so I says no that is not yours
[3:37:45] give it here so I open it up and thank
[3:37:49] God it's my Bible and I was so thankful
[3:37:53] and see that was just on Wednesday night
[3:37:55] that I had really claimed it and so the

[3:47:36] prayers and thank
[3:47:42] you it has been a good year and it has
[3:47:45] been a hard year for a lot but what is
[3:47:49] what is problems and heartaches to a
[3:47:51] Christian they're stepping
[3:47:54] stones for things to carry us on if
[3:47:57] everything went
[3:47:58] smooth we would comeo Bratz that's right
[3:48:02] you know and but he's training us he's
[3:48:07] getting us ready amen Prophet made a
[3:48:09] statement one day that was outstanding
[3:48:12] to me he said
[3:48:15] this bride is going to be
[3:48:19] tried to prove that she won't fall like
[3:48:24] Eve well to be tried you got to go
[3:48:27] through a lot of troubles and heartaches
[3:48:28] and problems and things for
[3:48:31] trials but see he's building a nature a
[3:48:35] character in his people that can stand
[3:48:37] the
[3:48:39] pressure when all these things we've
[3:48:41] talked about the testimonies and the
[3:48:43] witnesses and all all of going through
[3:48:45] and all like that it's Stepping Stones
[3:48:47] just to get us ready to be able to
[3:48:50] just stand whatever comes if it
[3:48:54] comes you know and the worst thing that
[3:48:58] I see now and I'm not throwing no Stones
[3:49:00] just just me I'm that old sergeant that
[3:49:04] brother was talking about while ago the
[3:49:07] story was to brother Timothy them I told
[3:49:10] him one day I said you know in the
[3:49:11] military you you you get an old tough
[3:49:15] Sergeant you hate his guts he works you
[3:49:19] to death runs you to death this one
[3:49:22] brother told me about his was so tough
[3:49:25] with his it that he just spit in his
[3:49:27] face and stick his throw him down in the
[3:49:30] mud and just stand on him and press his
[3:49:32] nose in the
[3:49:34] dirt I said yeah but when you came back
[3:49:36] from
[3:49:40] Vietnam you order looked that guy up and
[3:49:44] said thank
[3:49:46] you because you survived because of him
[3:49:50] well old tough Sergeant sometimes has to
[3:49:53] be rough but just remember we're trying
[3:49:56] to make soldiers out of people instead
[3:49:58] of being sissified little you
[3:50:02] know
[3:50:04] kids but it's a great year it's a great
[3:50:07] time I'm glad all of the tops the
[3:50:10] Shadows the predictions that we went
[3:50:13] through all these years
[3:50:15] I'm glad all of that's just about faded
[3:50:18] out you
[3:50:20] know now the church can get down to the
[3:50:22] bride to the worse you can just sit down
[3:50:25] and believe what the prophet
[3:50:28] said and that way then you can just walk
[3:50:31] right on we believe the
[3:50:34] message but we're not looking for the
[3:50:36] resurrection of the Prophet I am because
[3:50:39] I believe and he can be the first in the
[3:50:41] resurrection that's fine you know that's
[3:50:44] okay okay but I'm looking for a
[3:50:49] bride to become the word
[3:50:53] yes and you say well it'll just be
[3:50:55] something happened and we'll just speak
[3:50:58] it you
[3:51:00] can't when I first came into the message
[3:51:03] there were a lot of people saying that
[3:51:04] that one day we'll speak the
[3:51:07] word I said yeah but there's only one
[3:51:10] problem you got to get it first
[3:51:15] what do you mean I got it well why
[3:51:17] hasn't It
[3:51:18] produced as brother Brown said about it
[3:51:21] I was bringing out there Sunday he said
[3:51:23] why hasn't your Reigns brought Christ to
[3:51:25] the
[3:51:26] church he said you SED denominational
[3:51:30] Reigns spoken word Original
[3:51:33] Seed you s denominational
[3:51:37] Reigns he said that's but said the word
[3:51:40] is sown pure and
[3:51:42] unadulterated right so we don't have to
[3:51:45] correct the message you don't have to do
[3:51:46] nothing that's
[3:51:49] right and like I've always said I know
[3:51:51] I'm hard when I say things but if you
[3:51:54] can correct the prophet then pull off
[3:51:57] your shoe I want to kiss that toe CU you
[3:52:00] are almighty
[3:52:03] God because that's the prophet stands
[3:52:06] before nobody that's right but God
[3:52:11] alone nobody could tell him
[3:52:15] that the white horse
[3:52:16] rider was the
[3:52:20] Antichrist Clarence Larin taught it way
[3:52:23] before brother brandham ever come
[3:52:26] along but it didn't do no
[3:52:29] good but one day the Lord opened his
[3:52:33] eyes didn't he and showed him that white
[3:52:36] horse rider was the Antichrist wouldn't
[3:52:39] the Holy
[3:52:41] Ghost the the prophet stands before God
[3:52:45] arguing dates and times and
[3:52:52] things why don't you just get out and
[3:52:54] forget it and run on and leave the
[3:52:57] message alone you
[3:53:00] know but yet see people don't want to do
[3:53:03] that they want to stay in and cause
[3:53:05] trouble and that's what this year has
[3:53:08] been the worst
[3:53:10] year of people attacking the prophet his
[3:53:14] dates his times his wordings his thing
[3:53:18] will you think it's not going to get
[3:53:20] worse this year that we're in
[3:53:25] now it's going to get worse and worse
[3:53:28] and
[3:53:32] worse but the bride is going to be
[3:53:37] ready and she's going to stand the test
[3:53:40] we're in the new year so let's just
[3:53:42] stand together have to get my
[3:53:46] Bible being in a new year a new
[3:53:50] time we take the
[3:53:53] communion and we
[3:53:56] just
[3:53:58] then Fellowship together for a little
[3:54:01] time in this new year while the world is
[3:54:04] screaming and
[3:54:06] hollering you know but we just have a
[3:54:10] good time in the Lord right
[3:54:15] Paul in Corinthians 11
[3:54:18] says for I have received of the Lord
[3:54:20] that which also I delivered unto you
[3:54:23] that the Lord Jesus and the that Lord
[3:54:25] Jesus same night in which he was
[3:54:28] betrayed took bread and when he had
[3:54:30] given thanks he broke it and said take
[3:54:32] eat this is my body which is broken for
[3:54:35] you this do in remembrance of me after
[3:54:38] the same manner also he took the cup
[3:54:40] when he had SED saying this cup is the
[3:54:42] New Testament in my blood this do ye as
[3:54:45] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[3:54:47] me or as often as you eat this bread and
[3:54:50] drink this cup you do you the Lord's
[3:54:52] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[3:54:55] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[3:54:57] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[3:55:00] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[3:55:02] let a man examine himself and so let him
[3:55:04] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[3:55:07] for he that eateth and drinketh
[3:55:08] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[3:55:11] to himself what not discerning the
[3:55:14] Lord's
[3:55:15] body for this caused many are weak and
[3:55:17] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[3:55:20] we would judge ourselves we should not
[3:55:23] be judged now I love this
[3:55:25] scripture this is one of my favorite
[3:55:28] scriptures but when we are
[3:55:32] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[3:55:37] we should not be condemned with the
[3:55:40] world that ought to ring into your heart
[3:55:43] and you think about it that he will not
[3:55:45] let
[3:55:46] me go wrong he will judge me and chasen
[3:55:52] me and keep me straight amen cuz he's
[3:55:55] not going to lose me he's got too much
[3:55:58] invested in his little bride a he
[3:56:00] wherefore my brethren when you come
[3:56:02] together to eat toay one for
[3:56:05] another and if any man hunger let him
[3:56:08] eat at home that you come not together
[3:56:10] under condemnation and the rest will I
[3:56:12] set in order when I come
[3:56:16] let's just have a few moments in this
[3:56:18] new year of prayer silently
[3:56:21] praying praying for one
[3:56:24] another praying for the pastors praying
[3:56:27] for the people that lead us and guide us
[3:56:31] because you know contrary to seemingly
[3:56:34] what people
[3:56:35] believe pastors have to have
[3:56:39] pastors you
[3:56:41] know I never didn't know where the
[3:56:43] Prophet said
[3:56:45] that they didn't need nobody
[3:56:47] else we have to have each
[3:56:50] other and we have to believe it so let's
[3:56:53] just pray
[3:57:09] right we thank you Lord for this day and
[3:57:11] this
[3:57:12] time a new day
[3:57:17] and Lord as you said there in the
[3:57:19] scripture one day said tighten up CU we
[3:57:23] ain't been this way
[3:57:26] before but yet we know somebody that has
[3:57:29] walked this
[3:57:31] way you walked it before
[3:57:34] us so all we got to do is find your
[3:57:37] Footprints and just walk in them Lord
[3:57:39] and everything will be all right so you
[3:57:42] lead us whatever this year brings you
[3:57:44] make us to be happy and
[3:57:47] joyous no matter what goes
[3:57:49] wrong all is well because you said
[3:57:54] so we love you and we thank you
[3:57:56] father in Jesus name that we say to them
[3:58:00] what there W them's watching happy New
[3:58:03] Year you'll get to it in a little while
[3:58:07] and you can have yours we have
[3:58:09] ours father we thank you for this bread
[3:58:12] it's been made for this purpose tonight
[3:58:15] Lord we know that it's not your body but
[3:58:18] it represents your body we know that as
[3:58:21] we partake of the bread then we're
[3:58:24] partaking of the word of the hour that
[3:58:26] we're living because that's the main
[3:58:27] bread because you said you was the bread
[3:58:29] of life you said your word was spirit
[3:58:33] and in life yes it's not just letters on
[3:58:36] the page but you are in the Living God
[3:58:39] we love you and we thank you we ask you
[3:58:41] to sanctify the bread and the partakers
[3:58:44] in Jesus
[3:58:54] name we never take communion that we
[3:58:57] don't think
[3:58:58] about the children of Israel and coming
[3:59:02] down to the end and getting ready to
[3:59:05] leave out of
[3:59:06] Egypt you know what's the last thing
[3:59:09] was took communion
[3:59:14] that was the last thing cuz they had the
[3:59:16] the
[3:59:17] supper and
[3:59:19] then in that supper part they had a
[3:59:22] little part that a lot of people hadn't
[3:59:24] thought about but they had a little part
[3:59:27] in
[3:59:28] that but they took the wine and the
[3:59:31] bread and they went through the things
[3:59:33] and Jesus when he came
[3:59:35] and picked it up he just
[3:59:39] simply explained it Paul taking the Old
[3:59:43] Testament bring it down he explained it
[3:59:47] what they might not have known exactly
[3:59:50] what they were
[3:59:52] doing but yet they were getting ready
[3:59:55] for you and I and then what about
[3:59:59] it what about coming down to the end in
[4:00:01] a
[4:00:05] Rapture going to the wedding

[4:00:53] symbol of your body we drink this little
[4:00:57] wine tomorrow in our body There Will Be

[4:02:38] me
[4:02:40] yeah there's always a new word for every
[4:02:43] day
[4:02:44] not another
[4:02:47] message we could stay around here 10,000
[4:02:50] years and we'd still be getting more
[4:02:53] from this message and we don't have to
[4:02:55] worry about it it's not something
[4:02:58] new it's back to the original as our
[4:03:01] brother said earnestly contending for
[4:03:04] the faith yes sir that was once
[4:03:09] delivered but it will be delivered again
[4:03:12] sir
[4:03:14] yes and I believe the prophet brought
[4:03:15] the message but you know what it's got
[4:03:18] to be revealed to you and
[4:03:20] I as I was preaching to you Sunday yes
[4:03:24] all you can do a preacher can do is seow
[4:03:26] a germ that's right we say we go sewing
[4:03:30] and
[4:03:31] Seed you can't sew seed
[4:03:34] folks you s a
[4:03:35] [Music]
[4:03:39] germ a germed then watered becomes a
[4:03:43] seed
[4:03:45] you can preach all day long won't do any
[4:03:47] good but if there's one person there and
[4:03:51] that Holy Spirit can drop down and
[4:03:53] Quicken what you've said now you got a
[4:03:56] seed it can come alive Happy New Year we
[4:04:00] take the communion
[4:04:14] man make sure you tell
[4:04:17] brother Timothy how much you appreciate
[4:04:19] it we believe the message believe what
[4:04:22] he was
[4:04:23] saying we're earnestly contending for
[4:04:26] the
[4:04:27] faith you don't hear a lot preached now
[4:04:31] among the people of the message or the
[4:04:33] faith of the fathers they're so
[4:04:35] revelated they're all up and gone you
[4:04:38] know and I can't I'm not no making no
[4:04:43] out of nobody
[4:04:46] but a lot of people are too Heavenly
[4:04:50] minded to be of any Earthly
[4:04:52] good you
[4:04:55] know I think we're still
[4:04:58] here but yet the word is
[4:05:02] unfolding and it'll be that word that'll
[4:05:04] change you and I am it's already been
[4:05:09] spoken I told you there's things that
[4:05:12] had to be said
[4:05:14] when that Prophet when I was listening
[4:05:16] to that Rapture
[4:05:20] message ain't no Rapture in the
[4:05:23] Bible you said yeah there is Enoch no no
[4:05:26] he's translated different things happen
[4:05:28] word rapture is not in the
[4:05:31] scriptures
[4:05:32] right but you see the prophet coming he
[4:05:35] said it has been
[4:05:37] spoken now let it come to pass I believe
[4:05:42] if he hadn't said that
[4:05:44] there wasn't going to be no Rapture in
[4:05:46] this end time that's how much dependence
[4:05:49] I have upon the
[4:05:51] message is it's going to be this message
[4:05:54] that'll change us then you know what
[4:05:56] this message is going to
[4:05:59] Israel through them two witnesses Ur
[4:06:02] this message brought over to
[4:06:05] Israel go when you see a book about the
[4:06:08] seventh seal and read it said them two
[4:06:11] prophets will say you me best the
[4:06:14] opportunity to be the bride we said
[4:06:18] these Gentiles has received it now you
[4:06:20] are in the tribulation because you
[4:06:23] turned it down and said but they
[4:06:26] received

[4:06:31] persecution because of a little Gentile
