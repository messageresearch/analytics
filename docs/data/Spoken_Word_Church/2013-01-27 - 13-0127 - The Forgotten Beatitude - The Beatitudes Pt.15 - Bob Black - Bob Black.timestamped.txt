[0:00] all
[0:06] right morning
[0:12] everyone
[0:14] um y'all might have met my
[0:16] brother-in-law brother Matthew and my
[0:18] sister-in-law sister Daniel brother
[0:20] Matthew pastors the church down in
[0:22] Mobile and we're glad to have them been
[0:25] spending a lot of couple days of good
[0:28] Fellowship and
[0:31] S glad to have him with us this morning
[0:37] y sister Jun said brother Joe is going
[0:40] to urgent care this morning so let's
[0:41] remember know he's having coughing and
[0:43] stuff and brother boy said how and aubre
[0:46] are still bad so this
[0:54] remember Jo Joe
[0:58] Joe
[1:03] but we're going to read from Matthew
[1:07] 11 and have your finger on Psalm 119
[1:20] also Psalm 119 but we're going to read
[1:24] Matthew 11
[1:28] first
[1:34] now last time we we ran through the
[1:36] Beatitudes and we finished up with
[1:37] blessed are the
[1:39] persecuted and um those are all the
[1:42] Beatitudes that Jesus preached on The
[1:43] Sermon on the Mount but there's another
[1:46] beatitude that everybody forgets about
[1:50] and this is the one I'm going to talk
[1:51] about
[1:52] today so let's start off in Matthew 11
[1:56] and just read about uh John remember
[1:59] John on the River Jordan we talked about
[2:01] how he knew his place he was supposed to
[2:04] introduce the Messiah and the Messiah
[2:08] knew his place what he had come to do
[2:10] and they met there on the River Jordan
[2:13] and uh John saw the Spirit descended on
[2:17] Jesus like a dove amen and he knew what
[2:20] was he knew who he was he declared who
[2:23] he was he declared him to his disciples
[2:25] when uh he was standing there talking to
[2:27] two of his disciples and he said there
[2:29] he goes right there and they went and
[2:30] followed after him so he knew who he was
[2:32] but then when he went when Herod put him
[2:35] in in uh Jail uh then John you John his
[2:41] ministry was he was preaching it hard
[2:43] the axes laid to the root of the tree uh
[2:46] um just coming at the people real hard
[2:48] and then then Jesus when he saw Jesus
[2:51] come forth in meekness and humility and
[2:54] meek and lowly it says the scripture
[2:56] then he had a little problem so let's
[2:59] read
[3:00] uh Matthew 11 verse1 and it came to pass
[3:04] when Jesus had made an end of commanding
[3:06] his 12 disciples he departed then to
[3:09] teach and to preach in their
[3:11] cities now when John had heard in the
[3:13] prison The Works of Christ he sent two
[3:15] of his disciples and said unto him art
[3:18] thou he that should come or do we look
[3:20] for
[3:21] another Jesus answered and said unto
[3:24] them go and show John again those things
[3:27] which you do hear and see the blind
[3:30] receive their sight and the lame walk
[3:34] the lepers are cleansed and the deaf
[3:37] hear the dead are raised up and the poor
[3:41] have the gospel preached to them that's
[3:44] the sign of the Messiah he could have
[3:45] said he could have given him a yes or no
[3:48] answer or a yes answer but instead he
[3:51] said tell him declare to him the things
[3:53] that you have seen amen which are an
[3:55] Evidence of who I
[3:57] am let the life speak speak for who I am
[4:01] and and then he said this forgotten
[4:04] beatitude and blessed is he whosoever
[4:07] shall not be offended in me come on
[4:09] praise God blessed is he whosoever shall
[4:13] not be offended in me
[4:15] now
[4:17] offended if we compare this real quick
[4:20] with Psalm 119
[4:23] 165 Psalm 119 verse 165 it
[4:28] says great peace have they which love
[4:33] thy law and nothing shall offend them
[4:37] and offense right here is speaking of
[4:39] being ashamed stumbling over God's word
[4:42] because it's presented in a way that we
[4:45] don't understand and uh so we'll take a
[4:48] little history down through scripture of
[4:51] how when the word is presented to people
[4:53] in a way that they don't understand it
[4:56] St they stumble over it and and uh
[5:01] many times are ashamed of it but if
[5:03] we'll search the scriptures and look at
[5:06] the law what Jesus told them search the
[5:08] scriptures for they testify me if they
[5:11] would have searched the scriptures they
[5:12] would have seen like Paul after he met
[5:15] the pillar of fire and he went in he
[5:18] went and studied the scriptures out for
[5:20] I believe it was two years and looked to
[5:22] prove in the scriptures what was spoken
[5:25] of about Jesus and then he was convinced
[5:27] because he knew he saw for himself that
[5:30] the scriptures testified that this
[5:32] Christ was the one to follow amen
[5:38] now just because the psalm says great
[5:41] peace have they which thy law and
[5:43] nothing shall offend and that now that
[5:45] doesn't mean that in uh our our
[5:47] conversation with one another that we
[5:49] can't be wounded in our spirit because
[5:52] you know I think a lot of times we can
[5:55] present the gospel better people are
[5:57] looking at you know how brother Bram
[5:58] said that we're everyone in the
[6:00] congregation is preachers in the sense
[6:03] that your life preaches louder than any
[6:06] words that you could say that's right
[6:08] and if you come and if you confront
[6:10] someone with the gospel and your life is
[6:12] speaking something different then they
[6:14] got to go around your life to get to the
[6:16] true word but when the truth is
[6:18] presented then they uh if we'll look at
[6:21] the search the law then we will not
[6:24] stumble over the truth someone that
[6:26] really investigates and seeks after it
[6:30] and uh so I have some scriptures just uh
[6:33] kind of pointing out how we should uh
[6:36] you know brother brand when a lot of
[6:38] times when he would speak he would pray
[6:40] Lord don't let me stumble cause anyone
[6:43] to stumble and and uh he was talking
[6:45] about this sister that
[6:48] uh he he saw and he said sister you your
[6:51] dress is too tight you're going to be a
[6:53] stumbling block to the other sisters to
[6:55] the weaker sister the younger ones that
[6:57] will look at you and uh you know you're
[7:00] trying to say well I'm a message
[7:01] believer but you're not dressing right
[7:03] you're not living right and that that's
[7:05] an she said well that's all I can buy
[7:08] they don't uh you know that's all the
[7:10] store sell and he said well this they
[7:12] sell sewing machines cuz uh if if what's
[7:16] people are looking at the life that's
[7:18] what we're looking for is someone who
[7:20] can live and manifest the life of God
[7:23] not just uh say words in Romans 12:3
[7:30] for I
[7:31] say Romans
[7:33] 12:3 for I say through the grace given
[7:37] unto me to every man that is among you
[7:42] not to think of himself more highly than
[7:45] he ought to think but to think soberly
[7:47] according as God has dealt to every man
[7:51] The Measure of Faith Praise You Jes I
[7:54] think sometimes that can be a stumbling
[7:56] block to others when we present the go
[7:59] gopel in a way that we are above the
[8:01] other person you know we we uh present
[8:04] it in a condescending Manner and uh you
[8:08] know just looking back through my own
[8:10] life and mistakes I made I can I
[8:12] remember uh you know saying the truth
[8:15] but if if I didn't say it in a way that
[8:18] was loving then you know you can just
[8:19] see people kind of turn it off because
[8:22] they have to go around the life if
[8:24] you're not if your life doesn't match
[8:27] what your what your words are
[8:30] Ephesians 4: 1-3 I therefore the
[8:35] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that
[8:36] you walk worthy of the vocation where
[8:39] with ye are called with all loneliness
[8:43] and meekness with long suffering
[8:46] forbearing one another in love
[8:49] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[8:52] spirit in the bond of peace and uh you
[8:56] know how in the Old Testament David
[8:58] testified of of uh he know he said I
[9:02] know that thou are uh your your patient
[9:05] and and uh all he testified of Christ's
[9:07] attributes and those attributes that he
[9:10] was longsuffering with us and patient
[9:12] with us while we uh you know came to the
[9:14] knowledge of the truth and that's how we
[9:16] should be to one another Ephesians 43132
[9:20] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[9:22] and flamor and evil speaking be put away
[9:25] from you with all malice and be ye kind
[9:29] one to another tenderhearted forgiving
[9:31] one another even as God for Christ's
[9:34] sake hath forgiven you and Proverbs 1819
[9:37] I'll just read it real quick a brother
[9:40] offended is harder to be one than a
[9:43] strong City and there contentions are
[9:45] like the bars of a castle and Martin
[9:48] Luther translated like this a brother
[9:50] wounded resisteth more than a strong
[9:52] City and strife resisteth more than
[9:55] bolts in the
[9:57] palace and and
[10:03] uh you know brother brandom talked about
[10:06] how uh uh how we should treat each other
[10:10] in our home he was talking about a man
[10:13] treats his wife that we all have uh he
[10:17] said now there will be times that you
[10:19] all won't see things alike but always
[10:21] remember you're still in love when you
[10:22] see one set in the way and the other
[10:24] don't I said give in if they're wrong
[10:26] it'll show and after a while it'll be
[10:28] all right I said there's a little bow in
[10:30] a human heart that is full of golden oil
[10:33] called love if it is ever broke it can
[10:36] be healed up but there will be a scar
[10:39] there as long as you
[10:40] live but on the other side of that
[10:44] argument he said don't be afraid to get
[10:47] Battle Scars because Caesar was uh you
[10:50] know looking for someone to ride with
[10:52] him in his Chariot after the after the
[10:54] battle was running he came across this
[10:56] little fellow that had scars all over
[10:58] his face
[10:59] and uh he was ashamed of his scars and
[11:01] he said where'd you get those scars and
[11:03] and the man said I got them fighting for
[11:05] you for my Emperor and uh he said come
[11:08] on up in my Chariot and ride with me
[11:09] because you got those scars fighting for
[11:12] me and brother R said and palm worm
[11:15] Locus korm caterpillar show some scars
[11:18] you ain't had no testimony yet you
[11:20] haven't done nothing might as well get
[11:22] out and do something for God do
[11:24] something so we should try not to give
[11:27] each other scars but we should not be
[11:29] afraid to take to to get out and and get
[11:32] some scars to show that we've been
[11:34] fighting the
[11:35] battle
[11:38] and
[11:41] now is the door
[11:44] open do you
[11:47] have said about the SCS do you know
[11:50] what's that's from that is in P worm
[11:53] Locus korm caterpillar 1953 paragraph
[11:57] E64
[12:02] thank
[12:03] you and
[12:05] uh there's so many times in the
[12:07] scripture where uh uh sometimes the word
[12:11] will be presented in a way that it seems
[12:14] harsh but it's the truth and the and the
[12:17] truth we we should not stumble over a
[12:20] real True Believer desires to be
[12:23] corrected and uh and remember in Mark 7
[12:27] 243
[12:29] 1 uh where uh it uh I'll just read it
[12:33] real quick you don't need to turn to it
[12:35] and from then he arose and went into the
[12:37] borders and tire and siding and entered
[12:39] into an house and would have no man know
[12:41] it but he could not be
[12:43] he I was uh I was kind of thinking about
[12:47] that how that types the baptism of the
[12:49] Holy Ghost is a secret thing to you
[12:52] personal relationship when it comes into
[12:53] your house but it can't be hid for a
[12:56] certain man woman whose Young daughter
[12:59] had an unclean Spirit heard of him and
[13:02] came and fell at his feet now she was
[13:05] convinced that he had the life that she
[13:07] was looking for that he had the truth
[13:09] when she came to him she was already
[13:11] convinced the woman was a Greek a Sy
[13:13] phenician by nation and she besought him
[13:15] that he would cast forth a devil out of
[13:17] her daughter but Jesus said unto her let
[13:21] the children first be filled now there's
[13:24] a little hope first let the children be
[13:27] filled and then for for it is not meat
[13:30] to take the children's bread and to cast
[13:33] it unto the dogs and he called her a dog
[13:37] now uh a lot of times things that God
[13:40] tests us a lot of times to see how bad
[13:43] do you want it and it's not supposed to
[13:45] be easy it's supposed to be uh you know
[13:48] a lot you know when the offering plate
[13:50] comes by a lot of times maybe this uh uh
[13:53] not a perfect tipe but it's not easy to
[13:57] you don't you don't have an automatic a
[13:59] debit machine to pay your ti you know
[14:01] it's not or you can just sit on the
[14:02] couch all the time and your money
[14:04] automatically goes into church or
[14:05] whatever that that wouldn't be right
[14:08] it's you got to dig deep and uh you
[14:12] sometimes you have to to press hard to
[14:15] get what you're after and so he um she
[14:19] answered and said unto him Yes Lord she
[14:22] agreed with him because you it's it was
[14:24] a truth she was presented with the truth
[14:26] and how can you stumble over the truth
[14:28] she knew
[14:29] that he was telling the truth yet the
[14:30] dogs under the table eat of the
[14:33] children's crumbs and he said unto her
[14:35] for this saying go thy way the devil is
[14:39] gone out of thy daughter and when she
[14:41] was come to her house she found the
[14:43] devil gone and her daughter laid upon
[14:46] the bed brother brandom said in
[14:49] perseverance brother she was not a h hot
[14:51] house plant had to be baby petted around
[14:54] like some of the crop of the day oh my
[14:56] well I'll never go again this is all
[14:57] there is to it oh my no wonder you can't
[15:00] hold that sort of Faith no wonder you
[15:02] compromise on the words you go somewhere
[15:04] where you can hear some kind of a little
[15:06] sissified something put together you
[15:08] little hot house plant you the first
[15:10] little bug strikes you it kills you have
[15:12] to be sprayed all the time I don't
[15:15] believe that stuff the days of Miracles
[15:16] has passed it's the devil's spray
[15:21] Tenderfoot she admitted he was
[15:24] right but now down through history
[15:29] a lot so many times people have stumber
[15:32] from from from Peter and the apostles
[15:34] when Jesus said by the time the
[15:36] crows you you you are going to deny me
[15:40] uh just all through scripture people
[15:43] when they're presented with the word uh
[15:46] that and it comes in a way that they
[15:47] don't expect they stumble over it and in
[15:51] today we in this hour we should be on
[15:55] guard to
[15:57] uh uh just be uh watchful you know I was
[16:02] kind of studying what brother brandham
[16:04] had to say about the disciples and a lot
[16:06] of times we'll look at one another and
[16:07] think that uh because this brother
[16:09] doesn't act exactly like that brother
[16:12] then it stumbles us you know how Peter
[16:15] Peter was faithful it was a little fire
[16:17] brand and he told it like it was and
[16:19] then brother R said Andrew was a prayer
[16:21] Warrior who would pray all night and you
[16:24] can't say well Andrew should tell it
[16:26] like Peter or Peter should do like
[16:28] Andrew CU God puts each of us in the
[16:31] church into his own economy placing us
[16:34] and we're not like Cookie
[16:36] Cutters we we're not acting exactly the
[16:40] same God puts his attributes Us in us to
[16:42] manifest in different ways his
[16:44] attributes so don't let that stumble you
[16:47] and uh and then just I I made some notes
[16:51] of all the times through scripture where
[16:53] people were offended the Jews were
[16:55] offended at Jesus's parentage who his
[16:58] parents were and and how he came they
[17:01] thought that his parents had committed
[17:03] fornication they were offended at his
[17:06] place of birth because they said in John
[17:10] chapter 7 isn't he supposed to come from
[17:12] Bethlehem and he didn't say uh he didn't
[17:15] correct him he didn't come out and say
[17:17] um excuse me let me explain this to you
[17:20] that you think I Came From Galilee but I
[17:22] really was born in Bethlehem that's
[17:24] right they uh if they would have asked
[17:26] about it and a lot of times you know
[17:28] won't speak to someone before we judge
[17:32] but they didn't investigate and look at
[17:34] the scripture that's good
[17:38] brother they were the Jews were offended
[17:41] because Jesus healed on the Sabbath and
[17:44] he said I the Lord the S the L the Lord
[17:47] is the lord of the Sabbath you know I'm
[17:49] I'm uh they didn't understand what the
[17:52] Sabbath was about that it's a a a
[17:55] Eternal day of rest not any particular
[17:57] day they collected uh when he collected
[18:01] Grain on the Sabbath and he told them
[18:02] about don't you remember how David ate
[18:04] the showbread and it was found blameless
[18:06] and how the priests profane the Sabbath
[18:10] when they every Sabbath day they uh they
[18:12] go about their normal their normal work
[18:15] carrying things when the Jews had laws
[18:17] that you couldn't even carry a stick
[18:18] further than a set amount but on the
[18:20] Sabbath the priests and the temple would
[18:22] carry animals around and and uh do
[18:24] different things uh profaning the
[18:27] Sabbath what Jesus said in Matthew 12
[18:30] and he was telling them you you're
[18:33] offended at what I do but you don't even
[18:35] understand the
[18:38] scripture and they were offended in Mark
[18:41] chapter 7 because Jesus and his
[18:43] disciples didn't washed their hands
[18:45] before they ate and then John the
[18:47] Baptist disciples were offended because
[18:50] Jesus and his disciples didn't fast and
[18:54] he said how can you fast when uh when
[18:56] I'm you know paraphrasing when I'm I'm
[18:58] with you that's right how can they fast
[19:00] but when I'm gone then you'll mourn and
[19:02] desire to have desire to be in my
[19:05] presence and he they were offended
[19:12] because Jesus didn't maybe lead an Oster
[19:16] a life as they and their Master the uh
[19:20] meanness and obscurity of Christ Kingdom
[19:22] he was preaching about a kingdom that uh
[19:25] must be in you and it offended them U
[19:28] they were offended because their leader
[19:31] John went to prison for saying this is
[19:35] the one you know after confessing Christ
[19:37] he went to prison and they were offended
[19:40] because of the reproaches that Fallen
[19:43] someone that testified of Jesus and in
[19:46] Matthew
[19:48] 13:20 Jesus told the parable of the seed
[19:51] that falls in Stony places that becomes
[19:57] offended
[19:59] and just follow it all down through
[20:01] scripture how they were
[20:03] offended of John the Baptist lack of
[20:06] education and today they're offended at
[20:08] brother bram's lack of Education
[20:10] remember in the Old Testament how Elijah
[20:13] God came to Elijah and Elisha little
[20:15] poor people that didn't know uh part of
[20:18] their ABCs but the school of prophets
[20:21] where they were brought up and taught
[20:23] they didn't really understand what was
[20:25] happening and they would uh the people
[20:28] people of that day were offended at
[20:30] Elisha's bald head and they called it uh
[20:33] called him
[20:35] names and
[20:38] then all down through the three pools of
[20:41] Noah the three pools of Jesus as the
[20:44] three pools progressed they became more
[20:47] and more offended and more and more
[20:49] would fall away that's right
[20:53] brother uh you know a lot of times we
[20:56] can look at things how things are done
[20:58] in church and we'll stumble over it
[21:00] we'll say well I don't like the way that
[21:03] the song leader sings the
[21:06] songs I don't like the way that
[21:13] the that the service is conducted or I
[21:16] don't I've heard it before I don't like
[21:19] that that that you have a picture of
[21:21] brother Brandon hanging on the
[21:27] wall
[21:36] we've heard people say you know your
[21:38] your Sunday school class color pictures
[21:41] of brother
[21:46] Brown and people stumble over these
[21:49] little things and it lets them get in
[21:51] the
[21:53] way yes it
[21:57] does BR it brother bring
[21:59] it y'all I'm sorry it's it's all
[22:05] right you uh let your some people in
[22:09] your church go to baseball games or you
[22:12] let your children play sports and
[22:14] because of those things people stumble
[22:16] over it and fail to see God's word being
[22:19] revealed
[22:25] my yes Lord Lord
[22:31] and then we look at
[22:34] uh how Peter when uh before he got the
[22:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost that would
[22:40] keep you from being offended that would
[22:43] solidify you he said Jesus
[22:46] uh Jesus said then in Matthew 26
[22:51] 31-33 he said then Jesus saith unto them
[22:54] all ye shall be offended of me this
[22:57] night for it is written I will Smite the
[22:59] shepherd and the sheep of the flock
[23:00] shall be scattered abroad but after I am
[23:03] risen again I will go before you into
[23:06] Galilee he always gave him hope after
[23:09] I'm risen I'll go before you into
[23:12] Galilee Peter answered and said unto him
[23:15] though all men shall be offended because
[23:17] of thee yet will I never be
[23:19] offended and he made a a great
[23:22] declaration that he would not be
[23:24] offended but you can't say you can't
[23:26] make any declaration until you got the
[23:28] Holy Ghost that's
[23:30] right you can make all kinds of vasts
[23:33] and and proclamations but until you have
[23:35] the Holy
[23:36] Ghost there's not something in you that
[23:39] the rock of Revelation to solidify you
[23:43] and and we know the story
[23:45] that before the crew they had all
[23:48] ran and Scattered and Peter had denied
[23:50] him and said and and and even the Bible
[23:53] says he cursed you know and said I don't
[23:55] know him I don't know nothing about him
[23:57] and not
[23:59] and
[24:01] uh and brother Brandman questions and
[24:03] answers 1961 he said when you ministers
[24:06] are correcting someone about a gift when
[24:09] you're correcting them or spiritually
[24:11] correcting them and they get offended
[24:13] remember it wasn't the spirit of God
[24:15] because the spirit of God cannot be
[24:17] offended by his word he comes to his
[24:20] word see he's always willing a real
[24:23] saint of God wants to tow the mark yes
[24:26] sir I want to be corrected I want the
[24:29] Holy Spirit to correct me in things that
[24:31] I'm doing that's
[24:32] wrong I don't want nothing
[24:34] substitutionary I want the real thing or
[24:37] nothing just let me alone don't let me
[24:39] have anything at all because I'd rather
[24:42] do that than to bring a reproach on on
[24:45] the Christ and in Matthew 15 where he
[24:49] was saying not that which go into the
[24:50] mouth defileth of man but that which
[24:52] cometh out of the mouth this defileth a
[24:54] man then came his disciples and said
[24:57] unto him
[24:58] knowest thou that the Pharisees were
[25:00] offended after they heard this say in
[25:04] other words are you concerned that they
[25:05] were
[25:07] offended because you told them the truth
[25:10] don't you know that they were offended
[25:13] and he said but he answered and said
[25:15] every plant which my heavenly father
[25:17] hath not planted shall be rooted up amen
[25:19] let them alone they be blind leaders of
[25:23] the Blind and if the blind lead the
[25:25] blind both shall fall in into the
[25:28] ditch now let's finish up with
[25:31] uh the the Antichrist scripture John
[25:35] let's turn to John chapter
[25:43] 6 and let's start reading at verse
[25:52] 56 John Big John chap 6 verse
[25:56] 56
[25:58] he he that eateth my flesh and drinketh
[26:01] my blood dwelleth in me and I in
[26:05] him as the living father has sent me and
[26:08] I live by the father so he that eateth
[26:11] me even he shall live by me amen this is
[26:15] that bread which came down from heaven
[26:17] not as your fathers did eat mana and and
[26:19] are dead he that eth of this bread shall
[26:23] live
[26:24] forever these things say said he in the
[26:28] synagogue as he taught in capernium many
[26:31] therefore of his disciples when they had
[26:33] heard this said this is an hard say who
[26:36] can hear it when Jesus knew in himself
[26:39] that his disciples murmured at it he
[26:41] said unto them do this offend oh
[26:46] my what and if you shall see the son of
[26:49] man Ascend up where he was before it is
[26:52] the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[26:55] profiteth nothing the words that that I
[26:57] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[26:59] are
[27:01] life but there are some of you that
[27:03] believe not for Jesus knew from the
[27:06] beginning who they were that believe not
[27:08] and who should betray him and he said
[27:10] therefore said I unto you that no man
[27:13] can come unto me except it were given
[27:16] unto him of my
[27:18] father then John 6
[27:22] 66 from that time many of his disciples
[27:26] went by and walk no more with him
[27:30] because they were offended and they
[27:32] couldn't see God's word made manifest in
[27:35] in front
[27:37] of all right let's stop
[27:42] there thank you very good very good
[27:45] thank you thank
[27:50] you um when you about how the Holy
[27:55] Spirit would be offended
