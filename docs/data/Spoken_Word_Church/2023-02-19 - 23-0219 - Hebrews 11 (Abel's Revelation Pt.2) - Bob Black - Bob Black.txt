TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign God bless you this morning we've been looking at Hebrews 11 faith and uh kind of studying this out let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we can dive into our lesson Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord I pray Lord that you'll bless our gathering we know Lord we've got a promise laying there in your word that where the twos and threes are gathered together you'll be in our midst and we just ask the Lord that you'll Quicken the word that we hear today Lord and we study these things out Lord that you'll help us to give us understanding we pray in your name amen so verse 1 says just to uh remember last time we kind of ran out of time and uh you know sometimes I apologize for going so fast I'm gonna try to slow down a little bit I get I get Speedy like Speedy Gonzalez from The Bugs Bunny and Tweety show but we'll try to just slow down and meditate on on some things um and just kind of back up a little bit now verse one it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtained a good report I just want to mention real quick too if you hadn't listened to brother Ryan Sunday's going to listen on on faith you know when we were down there in Nicaragua um I got a chance to just go back and and listen again and catch up and and that I just really appreciate that his little lesson on faith and uh provide the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which were seen were not made of things which do appear and in verse 4 it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by he being dead yet yes yes speaketh now you know we I really really one of the reasons I just kind of wanted to just meditate on each of these things these these little stories is because it really drives the point home of what what is faith and you think about the condition that Abel and Cain and Adam and Eve and all them were in uh even the story about Adam and Eve oh that God told him multiply and replenish the Earth well it wasn't quite revealed how that was going to happen just wait and hold on wait for God to reveal it and if you go on and try to try to force it and try to figure things out then you get everything messed up and see that's exactly the same story that was repeated with Cain he tried to figure it out with his own mental understanding even though he'd been taught by his mother and father and and all the he had like the history and everything but yeah the difference is your Revelation and Revelation is when God comes and and and uh uh as as we'll he he takes the veil off of it and reveals to you the essence of the thing and brother Raymond said in the maniac of godari he said Abel had a revelation we're letting that soak just a minute it was a revelation that Abel had that made him just he had a revelation of the requirement of almighty God and he brought a lamb and that's the only way that you'll ever be able to see Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be by Revelation that's the only way you'll really be able to really be able to see uh anything that God wants you to see you know you know even I I think you know sometimes God just wants us to take take the Bible open and just set it down maybe in the evening and just meditate on on these stories like maybe think about how the the devil told his lie and their eyes were open and you you see there's these parallels that God wants to open your eyes and the devil's trying to open your eyes to his to his lies and his his deception but God wants to open your eyes to the truth and you see when when you begin to just sit things and think over just think about it like get up get get a scripture laying there in front of you and just think about what it means and let God begin to speak to you then God will reveal it to you and see there's the the Revelation is something that's um it's the it's the uh like like look at Abel there how how am I going to get back to God and and you can see have all the all the uh the education laying there in black and white on the page that you could read about but the Revelation was what to do what I need is blood is life that I was born wrong and you see when God begins to reveal to you that you were born wrong and you need a redeemer and how to get back it's it's something something that's coming off of the page it's it's something that's alive and real it becomes real to you and that's the only way you'll ever be able to see your Divine Healing your salvation the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Capstone anything that we're talking about the only you you've got to have Revelation and see what I'm getting at is revelation trumps Revelation goes beyond just being taught about something Revelation goes beyond just having having it lay there in black and white where you just kind of know it in your head but Revelation comes the only one that can give Revelation is God himself so what is revelation it's like a like somebody taking a a a a a covering off of a statue brother Randall use that example A lot of times because now now what was obscured now you can see the thing now you see like like Abel there and how am I going to get back well it was obscured Eve how am I gonna how am I gonna uh multiply and replace the Earth it was obscured it was covered over but when the cover is pulled off then you can see the essence of the thing so Revelation is the act of revealing or disclosing the dictionary definition of something God's good disclosure of himself and his will to his creatures you see that's what Revelation is all about that God what what really what is the evidence of the new birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you what what is the whole thing is God revealing himself to you and revealing as part of that his will and revealing when he as he reveals himself then your part in that so he's revealing you also because you're for so all of it is revealing himself to you so if we go back to uh and in verse 3 it says in process of time it came to pass that came brought to the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought to the firstlings of his flocking of the fact thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but in decaying into his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance failed now you see you you start look open up open up your Bible and just lay it flat on the on the bed at night and just look at those things why think about and I'm trying to encourage you to just meditate get along with God at night and or in the morning and think about these things why did God respect Abel why does God respect me does God respect what I'm doing why did God not respect Cain what's the difference here because Cain was religious Cain was he was coming to church and he was say paying his tithes and and doing all the things that a good church goer was going what would do what's the difference what's the difference and see the difference is revelation the difference is faith and then Brothers said now look at Cain in the Garden of Eden Cain when he come back to Eden he was just as religious as he could be he brought flowers and so forth and put them on the altar he brought the fruits of the field and laid him down he believed in God he worshiped God he sacrificed to God he built a church to God just as religious as he could be and Abel rolled him up a rock and made him a church or worship place see the differences in your heart not by intellectual by by his heart God wants you to Worship in spirit and in truth a quickened revelation of of God of the person of Jesus Christ and his will to you oh you see when you begin in during the Revelation then you know why you're coming to church it becomes more than just kind of going through some works and things so you're you're not just coming to church just to sit there you're you're you're it it's it's something real to you you see God wants us to fall in love with him that's what Revelation is about you see now now um we I'm kind of you know when you study at the message what brother round talked about education he he really hammered on education and Theology and Creeds because that's really what the essence of this story is Cain and Abel sitting there at the feet of Adam and Eve they they learned all about all about what happened in the garden and then leaving with surely surely they told them the stories of them leaving with the blood dripping off of their side and and the uh what happened you know not maybe not all the details and everything but they had a good education about that they they used to there there they used to be able to speak to the wind and the waves and and it would stop and now something happened and Moses down in Egypt he had a good education at his mama's feet where he she told him he was going to be a deliverer and Moses even tried by that edu by his theology he tried to just be a deliverer by killing the Egyptian well I'm gonna be a deliverer but it wouldn't work until God revealed it to him you see see there's a difference between Moses sitting at his mama's feet and Moses at the pillar of fire something changed when he got in front of the pillar of fire when God spoke to him and revealed to him his purpose then there was a difference the children of Israel in the wilderness wondering you know they continuously being preached at you can go into the promised land you can overtake the enemy but yet they didn't believe they didn't enter in by faith only two only two one in a million Paul Paul's ears with gamalia where he said at the feet of gamaya and still he failed to recognize that that all those scripture Those Old Testament scriptures were fulfilled in Jesus Christ see there's the difference between education and Revelation when finally he saw that light and it was and it and then the prophet prayed over him and the scales came over his eye off from his eyes and it was revealed to him all those things that he had been taught he had been educated for a long time but then then the revelations struck and and it was revealed to him just like all the disciples that stayed with Jesus for three and a half years and listened to him preach and preach and preach to them but yet they couldn't answer the question like how how are we supposed to be baptized until the day of Pentecost when Revelations struck and they come out they come out of the upper room preaching that we'll we'll tell you how to get born again because they had a revelation see there's the difference between education and Revelation you see we're not we don't come to church so much to get with education is part of it like maybe even the Sunday School lesson is it good education but when you're sitting here and then just some you begin to meditate on in the quiet of your room and you begin to think on God and some God begins to move and and then to see us not the preacher that's giving you the Revelation but it's God speaking to your heart and opening up something to you and you see see that's what that's the thing that gives you power that's the thing that gives you overcoming Powers when God gives you a revelation like he gave to Abel like he gave to Enoch that allowed him to escape the bonds of the earth like he gave to Rey a Rahab about a revelation that she knew that she had confidence in that little Scarlet thread hung outside her window and that trumped all the education that she might have had by the two spies telling her all the all kind of things about this and that and the history of the tribes going through the Wilderness and all that she knew because God she had a revelation from God and she had confidence in that oh you see you see what that Paul is all all through the book of Hebrews he's been laying a foundation to to get us to a place where we draw trust what God said because he wants us to trust him and when we don't trust what God Said like a bride whether it's married to a man and she goes looking at another man because she lose confidence in her husband that's the problem that's the problem that happened that that started in the Garden of Eden when he even goes to looking at something else and you know we kind of stopped in the last Sunday school lesson we're looking at at serpent seed because there's the pro the problem is is adultery and I really want to I don't know if we'll have time to get into it but I went and I studied out what the what the what the Israelites really believe about serpency and if you if you'll go back in history you'll find out that this ain't just some weird thing that we believe but it's actually what the Israelites believed all the way all the way from the beginning and I've got tons of quotes and things from the uh towel mood and from the um uh ancient all these ancient sources that this is what they believed from the beginning and so God gave us a prophet in this last day to take us back to the original Faith to take us back to what they originally believed to from the beginning now I got off my notes a little bit but that's where I'm going so I I said that to kind of keep everybody awake education education you see you can learn you can learn a lot of books in the Bible you can memorize scripture you can memorize all these stories but you can try to connect all the dots on your own but God when God gives you a revelation is him connecting the dots and putting it together into a perfect understanding you see when you try to when you try to figure it out you miss you miss the goal I'm just gonna look at this now I I I'm just kind of hammering on education he's in in Moses when brother Brown preached on Moses he said more simple you can get the more humble and get away from yourself your own ideas just take God's word for what it's worth and believe it and it's by faith that these things are come not what you can figure out you'll never be able how that that should give us I think it should give us confidence when you start when you stumble over maybe weighty doctrines and things just wait don't don't do like Eve and try to rush into it and try to figure just because you mess it all up and you see you look down through history and you can see so many people that have just got it messed all up because they they tried to hurry and figure it out and boom all that all of a sudden they ran into like a seven Thunder Doctrine where now they got some man that you got to go follow or or um uh you get all stumbled over over a weighty Doctrine and they just can't figure it out so now all of a sudden they're going and preaching politics or preaching on that uh things that don't really matter like dinosaurs and whether or not there were dinosaurs on the ark and uh you know maybe they were but that don't matter you know just you know you you don't don't try to force it and figure it out just wait on the Lord he said there's never been a man on the world on the world no saint nor no one has ever figured God out you can't so don't think that you can do something that they cannot do because that's right you just believe him that's what he wants you to do not try to figure him out just believe him you you see how it's simple simple is that Abel versus Cain Cain trying to have something that looks all polished up and stained glass windows and incense swinging from some thing in the church and gold-plated stuff and that's Cain but Abel is just a little Shepherd on a hillside David a little Shepherd on the hillside that all of his family looked at him and said ah well I wouldn't I wouldn't have known him to be king look at him he ain't nothing but that's what God wants God doesn't want somebody that can just get down it's where you can he can speak to you like like I was saying in the quiet of your s and the quiet of your prayer closet that God can come down and give you a revelation that no man can give you that only God can give you and God's provided a way of approach to Fellowship brother man said I'm not trying to support ignorance but I'm trying to say this that education has it's been one of the greatest hindrance that religion of Christ has ever had people are taken and using their schools of theology to try to educate people for well speaking and how to present themselves and so forth and they go Plumb away from the spirit God is not known by education God is not known by the nomination God is not known by Creed God is known by faith and that alone is by faith are we saved God is known by faith so just get as low as you can get get just real humble like a little child that Jesus said that's the kind of person God wants us to be it's just like a little child they can just take God at his word and wait for him to reveal it trust him and just stay right with the word and not try to force it not try to figure it out not try to jump to some weird conclusion there's been enough weird stuff yeah he said and God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same he said see he done it with his own wisdom Cain he done it by his own thoughts and that's what it is today they do it by their own wisdom by their schooling by their education and ethics that they have learned but Able by Revelation by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice nothing clean about it as far as it looked humanly speaking the little fella and grabbing him by the neck and wrapped a Vine around him like that and pulled him along to his altar there was nothing so beautiful about it laying him up upon the Altar and hacking his little throat with a sharp throat sharp rock until his blood flying all over him him bleeding dying it was a horrible sight see to it it was simple though in Simplicity he know that he was born of his mother and father's blood born in his mother's Blood by his father's blood and it was blood that caused the fall so it was blood that would take it back so he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice because it was revealed to him let me see excuse me a second I'm gonna jump through some of these try to get to my point so in verse 27 and 28 it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it now see there's god making a promise he's made a promise to Adam and Eve and see Eve's problem was he didn't just wait just wait for God to come and interpret that promise wait for him to come and fulfill and reveal it what what we're supposed to be doing there's our problem we just failed to wait and in Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 it says in the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatst thereof Thou shalt surely die so now we we know the story we've got we've got uh two trees here in the garden and these trees are are people there's two trees and you can eat for well you eat from One Tree you're going to get life you eat from the other tree and you're going to die oh you see you start meditating on this script that's that's my problem here this this right now you start meditating on these things and all these thoughts what does it mean to die what did they die all these things we've got to stay on track but you if you sit there and meditate meditate In the Still of the evening then God will begin to open up these things to you and reveal it to you and when in Genesis Chapter 3 Verse 6 when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it now I got these little pictures up here because we we know I think most of us here know the true story of this it's it's kind of funny to think of you know how most of the world pictures it like a snake with a little apple but now if you eat an apple it's not gonna an Apple's not gonna open up your eyes and the eyes of them both were open and they knew all of a sudden they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apron you see it wasn't an apple that they ate brother Ram said in the serpent seed message he said well and see where I'm going with this I'm going to prove to you that this is just not something that that some strange doctrine that just appeared out of nowhere or something he said what was the seed of the serpent adultery you follow it adultery with Eve what happened to that what brought that forth what is it tonight and you know Jeremiah in chapter three it says Jeremiah talking to Israel he said thou has played the Harlot with many lovers now Israel Israel Israel's playing a harlot but she's not doing it natural so we're talking about spiritual adultery to look at something other than the word God's God's made a promise God's proved his promise he come down and proved it and if we if we if we're married to Christ and we start looking at something else it's committing spiritual adultery he said lift up Jeremiah said lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou has not been laying with and the ways has thou set for them as the Arabian in the wilderness and thou has polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness there's Israel supposed to be married to Christ and going off and and and and and and flirting with idolatry and all of those strange gods that after God had brought them through the Wilderness and and yet they're and done all these great things and and yet they're cavorton with with all that stuff so there's spiritual adultery and natural adultery brother I'm saying I just got some quotes here her brother Ryan said some things about spiritual adultery he said that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you know him better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the Mind take in a lie of the devil against the word of God and another place he said taking the Creeds of man out here as a man's Creeds and accepting them instead of the word that's committing spiritual adultery against God and another place he said no denomination could put anything to it for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it it took away from it you're dead hybrid right there she's back here this testimony in her hands the filthiness of her fornications committing and spiritual spiritual adultery against the very word that she claims to believe see so God God has given us his promises he's given us his word if you deviate off of that you're doing exactly you see oh you see one word off brought death what what will the full restored word that's why God had to give us a prophet to take us back to bring life back to us and naturally said all these things about natural adultery he said let me tell you something sister dear you're going to answer I don't care you might be as pure as a lily you may never actually commit a sin of that type immoral sin in your life but if you dress like that you're going to answer at the Judgment for committing adultery with every man that looked at you the Bible said and walk down the street who is guilty the man no you no sir you are you presented yourself that way another place he said the devil cannot create he perverts what is being created what is an adultery an adultery is the right act perverted what is a lie it's the truth perverted now you see how that goes all the way back to the Garden that God had a plan in place and the devil came and perverted that plan and so to lie and that lie put called put Eve into a place where first she committed spiritual adultery and then it turned into natural adultery because how does adultery start adultery starts by somebody's telling you something that's wrong and you receive that in the womb of your mind first it starts in the womb of your mind and then it progressed in Eve's case to the wound her natural womb it starts with somebody telling you something you say that's a great idea somebody tells you you see you see why there's that that promise in Revelation that if you add something to it or take something to it you're you've got those curses because you you're adding to what you're you're messing up the promise of God to call somebody to to to stray away from God's word so in Genesis chapter verse 14 it says and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above every Beach to the field upon my belly that shalt thou go I dust shout though eat all the days of our life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now so you can see I just and I'm I'm we're going to sit on this for a while so I know I'm kind of going fast a little bit but it's all right there's two there's two C's there's a seed of Christ a woman see that the the woman's seed and and the serpent seed so the Serpent's got a seed so I now let's back up a second and just see what the Israelites used to say about this now you can read in John chapter 8 that when Jesus was speaking to the to the Israelites he said he told them I speak that which I've seen with my father and you do that which you've seen with your father and they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father see they're going back to their lineology genealogy Jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the works of your father then then said they unto him we be not born of fornication okay now they're talking about their understanding of what happened in the garden we're not born of fornication we didn't come from Cain we have one father even God now if you go back to I I got I found this book online that kind of summarizes what the Jews believe and it's written it's called The Legends of the Jews and it's written by Louis Ginsburg and it says that according to Jewish tradition after the fall of Eve Satan and the guise of the serpent approached her and the fruit of their Union was Cain the ancestor of all the impious generations that were rebellious toward God and Rose up against him Cain's descent from Satan who is the Angel semio was revealed in his seraphic appearance all right so let's keep going and the proto-evangelium of James which is this um there's a lot of these books that were not included in the Bible for different reasons and this is one of them and it says it's this is supposed to be Joseph speaking now you got to take a lot of this stuff with a kind of a grain of salt there there's a reason why they weren't included in the Bible but uh the point that I'm trying to trying to share with you is that this thought process was with the the Jews from Antiquity that of what really happened in the Garden of Eden and so this is supposed to be Joseph speaking Joseph Mary's husband and he said I received her from the Temple of the Lord God as a virgin but I did not watch over her who has preyed upon her so when he found out Mary was pregnant this is what he's supposed to be saying who has done this wicked deed in my home and defiled the virgin that's not the entire history of Adam been summed up in me for just as Adam was singing praise to God when the serpent came and found Eve alone and led her astray so too has this now happened to me so in other words he's saying just like that Eve was or this the serpent got even and impregnated her now this same story is repeating in me because now I found my little my little wife Mary now she's having a child with some other man is what he thought is what what the story is tertullian who is this um uh an author in the in the first around 150 A.D he was a a he wrote a lot of a lot of books on Christianity and things he said you are the speaking of women he said women you are the devil's Gateway you are the unsealer of that forbidden tree and I'm sorry we're gonna have to stop right there thank you foreign
