touch each one and let your grace be sufficient you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you we ask you to guide us now forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace and love in Jesus name amen so we're going to back up to about verse 9 and then read through uh verse 15 for the service tonight says and I John who also am your brother and and companion in Tribulation and the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto samna and to pergamus and unto tyat Tyra and Sardis and under Philadelphia and un lady OA and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and one in the midst of the seven candlesticks like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and GED about the pouch with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like a defined br as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now last Wednesday I believe it was when we're we're trying to speak a little bit about the the dispensation of the son of man and bringing it down to our day and our time you know to where we are and just a review just a tad but then what we're going to do if the Lord willing we can pick up a little bit in here and move on into uh something that I believe will help us to see because what has been our point it says in verse 13 there one like unto the son of man it doesn't say it's the son of man because he's it's not him there physically standing but he's in his church and I hope that has uh you know got to the point with you to where that you can see that to see that the word made flesh is the son of man all right then brother bradam is not the son of man he was a son of man he said that the son of man used to bring the message so the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ all right putting him in the church ages and we will get to that a little more and putting him into the position then you can see this is truly right when it said one like unto the son of man because he's in another form he's in his final form now that's the what I want if I don't get it tonight we'll get to it Sunday I want you to see something here on this point because this first chapter it starts in showing Jesus Christ you know in the Revelation and thing and it comes to a conclusion in the last scene or or U happening uh you know the Book of Revelations in there a lot of scenes is you know shows it in pictures or or whatever in scenes and see this tonight if you'll catch it and then Sunday we'll really lay heavy on it that this first chapter covers from the beginning of time to the ending of time all right now then you'll see then where that it ends up at because it ends up at the white Throne all right then being the white Throne judgment it winds up there as the end of all time or any connection to time or any you know whatsoever and I want you to see that because that'll show you where that what God thinks of you and I because of the position he places Us in all right but remember that now and think about it because see the the you know here we are the order of events uh the next is the rapture and then you go to the tribulation period with your with your Jews and the bringing out and the two witnesses and and then you have the millennial Reign and then you know you have Armageddon in the millennial Reign and then you have uh a Gog and Magog which is a cleansing of all things and the life just prior to the Future home is the white Throne judgment all right so keep that lined up in your mind and it'll help you and then you come back see and and and you'll see that that what we've been talking about all these Services is trying to see where we're at and he shows us here where we are in this situation and what this scene is all right but now we'll get to that in a moment but we were trying to cover how that what that brother randam says there three uh dispensations you know you got it as Son of God son of man and then you've got it to coming down as son of David all right but really you got it son of man Son of God Son of David be totally correct all right but then there's got to be something happened because it is was son of man back there in human flesh the word made flesh all right the Redeemer the Savior yall and all and that's why it was spoke of like that and why he kept speaking Jesus kept talking about who the man say I the son of man am all right because that's what he was doing son of man then has to do with uh the word coming forth all right making flesh according to verse 14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right then he gave his life and released that life at Calvary to where that it had come back into the people that were gathered in the upper room and then the 3,000 outside and the the coming down and it started another dispensation and none of those people through there could have any understanding as I even said about the Apostle Paul Paul never spoke anything about son of man you know I'm not saying he didn't understand I wouldn't say that whatsoever but he never spoke of it so maybe he was withholding by the Holy Spirit to De to deal into those things he spoke of heavenly things he spoke of future he spoke of all kind of doings but yet he never spoke of son of man right now Matthew Mark Luke and John spoke of the son of man but remember Matthew Mark Luke and John was not written till about ad50 from there on through and coming on in and so even the greatest of all that as they were doing John never mentions in his writings I I hope you follow that nobody mentioned the son of man and any of their writings you know Matthew Mark Luke and John you say that but remember that was the still in the Old Testament we've tried to get that across for a long time you know and uh that's what the brother you know he said where's the first book of the New Testament and way and I both said you know the book of Acts and you know because see I understood that in the Baptist Church if you ask a good Baptist where's the first book in the New Testament and he'll tell you the book of Acts because the Holy Ghost was not given Jesus Christ was not crucified during the Matthew Mark Luke and John so it began on the day of Pentecost of the New Testament form to bring it out and bring it into being all right see then when it did it brought by that new birth coming into you and I put in a dispensation would be called Son of God which is the Holy Spirit dwelling in each one of us by the new birth all right and that would dwell down through the seven Church ages as that Son of God all right then you will go from Son of God to son of David but there's the mystery that have tried to get you to see for 40 something years the mystery was there that Jesus spoke himself and said I'm coming back he spoke of his turn returning the coming of the son of man you know and he spoke of those things throughout his ministry but they still it was withholding from their understanding right even though they were the great writers of the Bible right and it was withholden until the last days cuz that's what Jesus said in the day Luke 17:30 when the son of man is revealed right all right we've tried to explain it back there through the thing that he asked the disciples one day he said who do Man say I the son of man am well look how God was going to seal it off and leave it that way to where they wouldn't understand son of man so p said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right Jesus looked at him and said Peter and you don't understand but yet you understand enough to where the truth can come forth and he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church rocks built on the revelation of Jesus Christ right now and in doing that then see he would become from son of God Son of Man the Son of God and down through the church ages you'd have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but a secret in the word that was there covered up to where man would not be able to see it that Jesus would be speaking of a returning of himself not in physical form not as a Corporal body you know no no no come on no don't go that way but he would come back as the son of man right and as he would do that it would start with who he would have to have a son of man to introduce the son of man cuz you couldn't just walk out and you know it's it was like he was then he walked out and he said who the man say I the son of man now nobody caught it the best they could do was what the Holy Spirit revealed to Peter that thou art the Christ in other words Jesus said all right Peter you've got it we'll build a church on this but one day I'll come back and cap that church off with a with myself being revealed all right now then we're not looking or was not looking wasn't supposed to be looking for the coming of in an individual as a human being to be the son of man but God would have to send us a prophet all right so he sent a prophet in the end time you go back to 40 I know it's 48 the first one I found it may have even been in 47 I know it's in 48 when run around and talks about son of man all right now what do you think about all the theologians if the disciples didn't understand son of man and didn't even write about son man how do you think those theologians that begin to hear the prophet speaking we know nothing about it is he trying to make himself something and then when he would show the sign of the son of man the healings and miracles and things then they couldn't follow it as to relate and say this is it this is what we've been looking for this is what the Bible says would come cuz they had no idea that it said it would come they had no concept of that to be coming there wasn't looking for the coming of the son of man why because he knew nothing about it all right and see look at the prophet year after year after year after year trying to get the people to understand what was going on in his ministry and what would he do like a a lady that brother M him knew of she was supposed to had spiritual gifts and things and she said well I've never seen no greater in William than what was in William brandom's Ministry except in my own you know except in my own all they seen was gifts they never saw that he was trying to bring a message right that's right you know that brother randam in his early Ministry used to let other people preach for it and then he come out and and would pray for the sick but see all at once he stopped doing that he started doing his own preaching all right I ain't got very much sense but I got enough sense to know them other Fells couldn't preach what he wanted them to preach you know they could get it right so he you know the Lord showed him to go on his own and bring the message all right and as he begin to speak to us throughout the Bible and explain the thing expound upon the great things that would take place and as he did he begin to talk about the church ages and the things and he begin to speak about this son of man all right if you think it's hard for me to preach about son of man now you ought have been with me in 1969 in Athens Georgia when I tried my best to explain Son of God Son of Man son of David and that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man made manifest in the last days you have been there when you was getting those burning eyes cutting you into two you know because nobody knew what I was talking about I'm sorry but I I believe it and I was still trying to preach it cuz I still believe it all right I don't believe brother Bram is the son of man that would make him the Lord Jesus Christ all right but he was a son of man a prophet that the son of man the prophet could come and speak through to bring us the message well the people wanted brother brandham in his early Ministry just as they wanted the Lord Jesus oh yeah they was glad Jesus was around when he was Healing The Sick and feeding the people and oh yeah they likeed that but when he begin to say I and my fathers one what brother brother say about that one day he said when you begin to say I am my father's one and these other thing he said that shuck will start pulling away from you why because they don't know what you're talking about that's in plain language all right but the thing of what I was trying to get over Sunday I mean last Wednesday in the services before is what no one no one person now can be the Lord Jesus Christ manifested in flesh that day was over back dire but as he would come into the bride of Christ and make himself manifest all right and he start doing those things as the Holy Spirit dwelling among us and it would even be on the zeusa street that brought around said that was the great prophet that came well you don't hear nobody talk about isusa Street except it was false and all the bad things that went on come on I'm asking you have you ever heard anybody talk about it no they don't talk about that we're Beyond this they don't talk about the faith of the father's you know the stature of a perfect man oh we're Beyond these things yeah Beyond it all right you can see where they went to they went to their own two Souls Two Lords seventh universes peruses you know all kind of things and went off on to the garbage cans with it all right but that don't change God's word that's right somebody has got to be the word made flesh in the last days because your Prophet was the one that said it the Bible says it amen so it's got to be but it can't be in one person I've drove that for 40 something years the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world today and the little part we have and the little part others have and all put it all together and you got the ministry of Jesus Christ dwelling on Earth that's why signs and wonders are not in one place like they was with the prophet and the things but that don't do away with signs and wonders cuz we still believe in them you know we still and have seen God do things all right now but are you following me see that's what he's doing and the prophet said there was in between now I'm speaking from the message that I used our Sunday or Wednesday was um does God change his mind about his does God change his mind he said you went down through the church ages said then it be you know talking about son of man which is a prophet Son of God which went through the church ages then son of David said but in between the Son of God and the son of David according to his own word and according to Malachi 4 and many scriptures he us to return back into his church in physical form in the people in in human beings the way of being a prophet do you know that every member of the body of Jesus Christ is prophetic right if not what are you going to tell me the Holy Ghost is I thought the Holy Ghost was the prophet right amen you know I thought about this the other day and I'm sorry I but I try to tell you the truth you know if the Trinity had never been taught are you with me if the Trinity had never been taught you wouldn't have to have preached about one God you would have already had it coming out of the word right but because the Trinity was developed by mankind in opposition to the word right then it's hard to preach a word it's hard to preach it and hard to see it even for Born Again Christians come on because that devil has so many inroads of you know talking about the Trinity you know praise Father Son and Holy Ghost well I do too I praise him but he's not three that's right all right see if it had never been taught about the to the people that well you don't have nothing I don't have nothing we're just all sitting down waiting you say I never heard nobody teach that well well wake up wake up wake up have you ever heard God don't do like he used to do you ever heard that say it come on we all come through the denominations we heard the preachers right we preach it we done it ourselves was we say and then well God just don't do now like he used to do now just bring that on up in a higher order and you come to find out they're denying the word of God right but we didn't think it in did we we thought it was a truth well what you getting at brother Dale I'm getting to the point of one thing if it hadn't have been taught by the people of this message after the prophet brought his message that you and I are nothing and just sitting around and waiting on a bus to pull up or something to get us out of here I wouldn't have to read these quotes over and over to you that brother brandham said the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man right made manifest in a many membered body you see what I'm talking about it's just as it was with the Trinity had it never been taught we wouldn't have had to fult that out to try to bring and it took it took the prophet 30 years he said 30 something years before he said he could ever preach this statue of a perfect man now that's in the book The stature of a perfect man why did it take him that long before he could preach it because the people didn't believe it they didn't even believe it when he preached it you see you say the Bride of Jesus Christ is to be the son of man I just don't well well maybe brother Dale maybe in a way you remember the quote from brother brandom he said when you say maybe in the way he said there's no such thing he said it's not maybe in the way he said it's either right or wrong that's paraphrasing but he said it's either right or wrong you know it's either Truth Or Not truth there's no gray areas to the Bible well that's just your way of seeing it now where did that come from I sure didn't come from God's word no it sure didn't come from God then so it must have come from the devil but yeah we use it don't we well who do you think you are you know I got a right to believe what I want to believe Constitution gives you that yeah but the Bible don't and uh right now I wouldn't be too interested in the Constitution okay I wouldn't want to use that no more that I got a right you don't have no right for nothing but look what he said he said in between the Son of God and the son of David according to his own words and according to Malachi 4 and many scriptures he's to return into the his church in physical form all right in the people in human beings right in the way of being a prophet now that was preached in 1965 here's another one proving his word and what were we talking about the other day he says he comes Son of God Son of Man son of man Son of God Son of David and he said remember he comes in three names the son of man a prophet the Son of God the spirit the son of David for the Millennium but in between this conjunction now according to his own words in the day when the son of man shall be revealed reveal himself as what not Son of God Son of Man will reveal himself in a different way now what does that make melachi 4 exactly right the son of man will reveal himself not in a whole big denominations and things he said we've done went through that but he' reveal himself as son of man again in Bride form cuz blood of ROM can't be the son of man right he is a part of the body of Christ was you following me last week he was a part of the body of Christ that's right in the body of Christ a church aged messenger a born again Christian a prophet no wonder it said was said of him said you have more gifts and things than any of the prophets why because none of the prophets were born again Believers in the body of Christ right and see then when it comes down to that you're talking about the son of man all right now let me get a couple I didn't give you I didn't give them to them to read cuz we've been through this enough but look what he says on paragraph 222 approving his word 1964 8:16 and the son of man is revealing himself in the same power that he was not down through the church age through justification sanctification all these things here but the son of man watch him who is the son of man that's what he said who is the son of man well it was brother brandham he was it who is the son of man the word and the word is quicker and more powerful than a two-edged sword who is the son of man the word look at him as he gets on it's the rising of the sun 1965 4:18 the morning service who is the son of man watch him in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of God by word of God by signs and wonders and he says it comes down to Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 and different scriptures that the Dead traditions of man is dead and gone what about it who is the son of man in the beginning was the word you know if the Bible's right we're close to believe it the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily right so in him was Father Son and Holy Ghost correct but in him was son of man Son of God Son of David all back there at one time but it could not be made manifest right he could heal but he couldn't save because you're dealing with son of man the Bible said that the son of man have power to forgive sin son of man man has power to heal well son of man couldn't save you come on if Son of God is your savior but where was he at he was standing there on the shores of Galilee there was almighty God in human flesh son of man Son of God Son of David all if you think it ain't right what the Jews what would that lady what the Gentile come up to him and touch him are wanting the bread is that right and what did he say he said it's not right for me to take the children's bread and give it to you you dogs Gentiles were dogs no place whatsoever in any form to be lined up she said Lord said the dogs eat the crumbs that come off the master he said I ain't found that faith in Israel she had no right to speak of him as son of David we've been through all of that right right right but she could speak of him as son of man but mainly she could speak of him as Son of God cuz that's who he was cuz that's what Peter said look Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God which meant he was the creator right John 1 Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 James 3 is it J or Ephesians where all things are created by Him and without him there was not anything made that was made not that flesh Man Standing on Earth no it was the Lord Jesus Christ that was dwelling within that flesh that Peter recognized right do we see that see then there is a a mystery that he would be son of man then he'd be Son of God and just for a little period of time in between this son of God and Son of David he would come back to be son of man and that that would end up being in the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right couldn't be it in Luther couldn't be it in Wesley couldn't be it in Pentecost couldn't be it in O going but in the bride in the end time to be the word made manifest well I just don't see it you keep on with that attitude you never will see it that's what's wrong with the people of this message I just don't see that brother Dale just so deep I can't understand what he's saying I'm so simple you can't understand what's the trouble is if I made it deep enough you could follow it I mean that's just honest it I can answer it if I tried to make it deep you could follow some kind of a lineup but trying to make it as simple as he can can be I'm just simply talking about you right that's all I've done for 40s something years is talk about the Bride of Jesus Christ upon the Earth and who she really is and what she's doing she's the word made flesh all right she is the son of man see this went from Son of God to Son of Man all right but that don't do away with Son of God cuz if there's anybody being saved today it's got to be done under Son of God is anybody receiving the new birth it's got to be under Son of God so you don't do away with him you just let him manifest for what he's doing for the hour that it's being done all right and then when you do you can see it all come out who is this son of man he's the word now in the beginning was the word word is with God and the Word was God now that is not in the beginning was the letter you know what I mean letters letters Paul said the letter kth the spirit giveth life so Jesus wasn't just letters of the word Jesus was what those Prophets of the word they had brought remember the prophets built the body John the last one of the Old Testament form introduced the head and Christ stepped out I remember all right see then when it comes down to it he was that word forgive me who are we to be I thought we used to be the word made flesh righten right well I can see it in brother brandham you know that's the way people are I can see it in brother brandham but I just can't see it in nobody else well you're blind that's right that's right come on brother Dale will tell you right up front you get mad at do what you want to you're blind because the prophet is one that spoke of the Bride he's the one that said these things about the Bride of Jesus Christ then you're arguing with him about it all but see that's what it comes down to so are you following me what did we cover here throughout these times that we've been going through this that brother brandham gives you where there what is it I'll get it in a minute but he said it like this he said this is the bride dra out you remember that that you remember us preaching on those things while we're not a denomination believe it is he said this is the bride what did it say one and I turned to see The Voice remember we went through all that all right now you WR down here below we just read where the voice was at I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying it was speaking and if you look in your Bible that's red letter that's supposed to mean God himself is talking right all right see then when it comes through that it comes up to verse 12 and he turned to see The Voice he knew the voice he had been with that voice for three and a half years on earth right he had heard The Parables he had heard the things right and when he did he turned to see the voice and the surprise was he didn't see Jesus in physical human flesh he saw one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man G about to pouch you remember we went through that with brother random PS means women you know this is a feminist form of God this is God in his life in morphe all right now this is God in his life form because listen this scene that we see is not just seeing the church ages and the things but it's so marvelous we'll pick that up Sunday it's so marvelously put that before he starts the church ages he's already told you how perfect you are because he's already described you as one standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick like unto the son of man you know that Daniel saw the same thing we'll get to that in a minute Daniel says one like un the son of man come to the Ancient of Days so now we're getting down to looking at something straight across and finding out something I hope anyway Hallelujah this one here is in Bride form all right and showing that what he thinks of the bride and how beautiful he shows her to be right before he ever even speaks of the ages or anything now we don't believe in pre-existence of souls Etc and things like that we believe in pre-existence of God right we believe in pre-existence even of his word we believe in pre-existence of every bit of his attributes that he ever had as healer savior Redeemer whatever you know Advocates whatever you want to bring out as hims to being that all of those was in God before the foundation the world all right that's why it says he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world see that that was back in God before the world ever begun the best way to say it because what else can you say it is in God's mind but I hope that it has gotten away from just being something maybe well God thought of this because you have to be careful when you say God thought of it because you can make god making it be what he wants it to be as to what he thinks of and that would get into the wrong category but this is seeing before the world what is going to take place upon the Earth that's to me is the secret of it all because when he gets to the church ages even the first church age he says to the Overcomer every age has got a message message to the Overcomer right cuz he already knows the end he already knows to finish before he starts amen and he wrote it right here in chapter one of the whole thing the whole journey of mankind because of what this chapter shows you and when it comes down too one Len the son of man G about the pouch with a golden girdle starts describing him then doesn't it he turned he saw seven golden candlesticks one like the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire do you realize what that is being said Do You Realize where that position is at that's why we read down here because we read them before but not to emphasize so much and verse n says that you know he was talking about the the kingdom and patience verse 10 says and I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now the Lord's day is not Sunday that mankind developed that neither is the Lord day Saturday or Sabbath do you need this where brother Rand said that the Lord's Day is when man's days are over is that sensible that's what I call Sensible answers because he just simply explains it right out the Lord's Day means the day not of man right but when man's Days Are Over well winter man's day is over it's not over in the Rapture right now still going on it's not over in the tribulation after the bride leaves because it's still a world and people it's not over in Armageddon when all of the great battles and the great things happens it's not over in the millennial Reign the days of man is not over in the millennial Reign because that is to Israel and and and we will be there with him in the Millennium it's not over in The Great Battle of Goan Magog because that's still mankind upon Earth even though a lot of that is a spiritual situation or the fire falling down from heaven Etc yeah but where is man's days over with the last thing when I started off tolds you where it's at just prior to the Future home man's days are going to end there won't be any time of man's days in the future home right right no dates times Seasons Etc none of that all right the life Earthly thing ever what you want to connect it to doing and get so great spiritual in your mind just remember it's the white Throne judgment all right just remember that's where it's at amen is the white Throne all right this description here here that we've been reading over and over and over for 40 this is 49 I think or either 50 sermons that we've read this scripture but it did click on you of anything to think about we've dwelt heavily on the in the midst of seven golden candlesticks we've dealt heavily about the uh you know the G about the PPS to be a bride but we hadn't mentioned too much about his hair and his his head and his hairs were white like wool now you're going to the white Throne you realize what I'm saying that this first chapter shows you from the beginning to the total ending of mankind right in just a few verses it covers the entire journey of the Earthly part of mankind and winds up at the white Throne what about it look look what he says now we'll start we'll read just a little bit a got just a few quotes so go ahead brother we're number one now and we'll start reading because it comes off of Patmos vision and biggest portion of this is a continual reading and uh just think about it so we cut it down to Revel 113 the midst of seven gold candles scks one lik and the son of man glow clothed with a garment down to foot and GED by the pouch with a golden girdle there stands one like unto the son of man as a jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so is he glorified where in the midst of the the churches it is the Lord's day for John sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge the golden girdle is no longer GED about the waist where the priest were must wear it as he ministers to God in the holiest place but it is now around his shoulders for he is not now the priest but the judge okay goes on down his service has been rendered the priesthood is over the days of the prophecy are finished he stands GED as the judge this Scene goes all the way to the white Throne judgment which is the ending of all mankind in all things is to come to an end at that position of the white Throne oh yeah now we all know and we but you know all we talk about white Throne we're not going that's all people want to know whether you're going or not you know well if you're not sitting on the throne with him you're standing before him and decisions are being made so now that's our choice all right but it won't be our choice then it's our choice now all right but look what he covers he said this is the day of the judge this is Judgment he goes through the highest wied wool his feet and all and then goes to the sharp two-edged sword and look what he comes up saying How Deeply moving and inspiring was the appearing of Jesus to John who was in exile for the cause of the word and behold the Living Word stands now before him what an inating vision for every descriptive attribute has a significance what a revelation of his glorious being now we spent a lot of time covering and I hope that there's no uh I hope you hadn't slept through or ped off or missed something all that I've been saying because I keep saying it over and over to where that you'll remember it you know and then somebody come up and later and say well brother Dale uh I never heard you say that about the the bride of Christ well now bud you sure slept a whole lot because we've been on it a lot of services so if anybody ask you say what's brother Dale believe about Revelations 1:12 13 14 I'd be ashamed if you didn't explain it to them as the Bri out of Jesus Christ God he it's it's like it doesn't say it doesn't say one in the midst of seven golden Candlestick like he's standing there and the candles are around him no he's in the whole candlesticks the candlesticks is the bride of Christ going down to verse 17 or 18 or 15 down at the bottom every where it get right right this is a vision to John this is an understanding to John of how beautiful God thinks about about his church and shows her as one like unto the son of man you remember I've said it to you for 40 something years in the Book of Revelation Jesus Christ is never seen by himself show it to me he's never seen by himself he's shown in his church with his church riding with his church or whatever but he's always got somebody with him that's right and even after we leave out of this Earthly Parts he's got the Jews to deal with right you see what I'm talking about now we've come to a point to see something that has been on my mind for 40 something sermons right that I hope you can see not just a quote that we don't go to the white Throne judgment you know you just ask ask people a question no we don't go to what through Jud Prophet said so well amen Now where's it at in the Bible and what's going on and show me the whole story of why you believe it that way right where is the bride at that white Throne judgment she's got to be sitting on the throne with him and she's doing the judging we'll get down to scriptures a minute in Corinthians where you even judge Angels but you probably thought that I was just praying that trying to get son of man son of man son of man this is tying together the entire Bible because we're going to see in the book of of Daniel where it's the son of man one like we're going to see where he comes to this is not just a quote we don't go to what Throne we said on the throne well amen okay now if that's all you got amen don't lose that that's truth now don't lose that but how come why is it that you don't stand before him at the white Throne whenever denomination there is believes we do you ever found one yet that believe we don't was it not taught to all of us that we got to go to the white Throne you said well no I never taught it well where did ever teach to you you wouldn't going to the white drone I've been around quite a while and I never did hear because it was always brother you better get right cuz there going to be a judgment day if you don't get right here there's going to be a judgment day coming that you going to have to stand before an Angry God and he's going to tell you to either go in or go out right well you probably didn't remember there like you don't remember now right you probably didn't listen in you prob around on something else folks listen you may not like me in my attitude but when this thing's over with you're going to come up and Pat me on the back when you find out you're sitting on that throne and you do it you're going to Pat me on the back for being mean and arrogant and hateful to you and hollering and screaming at you prise the Lord and I won't have no problems and won't say I tried to tell you now that's stupid stuff anyway you're going to thank God for somebody that told you the truth yes sir I went back when I left the Baptist Church I went back and I thank that preacher for all he'd ever done to help me to come to Jesus Christ I left churches in this message I always went and told them thank you for helping me why because what little bit they did help me they might have hindered in a lot of ways but they helped me too because this is a serious matter folks this is not just playing I see the church now my wife and I've been talking about it for a couple of days about the church now Lula is just sitting kind of in a stalemate condition and I'm screaming and hollering trying to get you across that to where that you can get into the real truth of what's going on I'm talking about you I ain't talking about that well brother Dale we're at church I really enjoyed Saturday there with brother Vernon in what he was bringing out he said I'm not saying that they're not Christians he said to but to people people are just backsliding sliding away no longer interested in church and the doings it's just we're going to do what we're going to do and if we get a chance brother Dale we'll be there I ain't got a thing in the world against nobody with vacations I ain't never said a word so don't start your garbage can mind's running ain't never said a word about vacations visiting your families and doing the thing never have I so don't get it okay you're talking to God on that deal not me cuz I don't beat on people about a bunch of things I try my best to preach the gospel for you to see Jesus Christ all right that's my desire when it's all over with we don't worry about it but there there's a lot of worries now you think this thing going to last another 10 15 20 years I sure hope it don't we're going to be in nursing home it ain't no joke we're going to be in nursing home and have services I don't I don't mean that a joke I'd say that keep crying but listen folks it's a time we get down to the message brother brandom explained these things to us that's why I give you the quotes I give you where he explained them and why it's like that to where he would be the one that would give us the answers okay go ahead with it's stilling number one we stopped off 533 we're on 534 all right this is from the patmas vision and we had just got through talking on the things he says he's coming to judge of all the Earth he will be crowned with wisdom that is what he what the wh and glistening hir signifies now look where he goes to so look back come back down Co we want to read Daniel instead of going in the Bible you can turn your Bible if you'd like to read it in Daniel 7 9-14 I beheld the Thrones that were cast down now the white throne in is it 17 or 20 it's in here in the Book of Revelations the white Throne judgment but R said it's the same as Daniel he said that's what he saw all right we'll read that in the minute to on down into the the script in the quotes but look and I held till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit you remember how he was covered in that that that wasn't because of it age or whatever whose hair was white as snow and whose garment was as white as snow and his hair of his head like pure wool his Stone was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire same identical situation we've been reading in chapter one because that is the white Throne judgment the days of man is over and he's showing in chapter one what is taking place all right and the Fire EX streem issu and came forth from before him thousands thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open white throwing judgment I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the Beast was SL and his body was destroyed and given to the burn as concerning the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged as coming to the white Throne judgment look and I saw in the night vision behold one like the son of man same as it is in in Revelations 1 one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven brother said bride of Christ that's who it is clouds of Heaven that's not clouds rank clouds that's people and came to the angel should of days and they brought him near before watch and there was given unto him who him one like un the son of man not giv to God you you got to get it straight in your mind right you talking about the one liking the son of man and there was given him who the one liking the son of man who is it came with the Clouds Of Heaven it's Jesus Christ with his bride coming to set on the Judgment seat not stand before it right and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all the people Nations and Lang languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away in his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed there it is Daniel saw him with the about her he was a judge opening the books and judging out of them Daniel saw him coming in clouds that is exactly what John saw they both saw him exactly the same they saw the judge with his judgment girdle over his shoulder standing pure and holy full of wisdom fully qualified to judge the world in righteousness Hallelujah even the world understand this s symbol symbol symbology I'll pronounce it somewh for in ancient times a judge would appear in convening court dressed in a white wig and a WR long robe that signified his complete Authority head to foot to meet out judgment Daniel saw the same thing John saw one like unto the son of man comes to the Ancient of Days those are terminologies it's not one sitting over here and here comes another God we got to get this God and we got to get that God it's what I said if it had never been taught we wouldn't have that garbage cans in her mind it wouldn't have that if I get up to heaven don't find father son Holy Ghost I'll just Le cuz I'll be in the wrong place you ain't never heard preacher say that if You' listen some you'd probably heard a lot of them say CU they were firm trinitarians that believe there's going to be three gods no there's going to be a white Throne judgment there's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ in his bride sitting there and the Lord Jesus Christ will have the dominion over all things and that Dominion will be shared equally with his people you want a scripture I thought we were ours and join ours I thought that's what the Bible said that we were ours and join ours with who Jesus Christ so whatever he gets we get so we sat on the throne amen with him judging all the others right okay coming on down what are we looking at one like unto the son of man he goes back to Revelations 20 there's where the white Throne is okay if they'll pull that up to paragraph be number two paragraph 275 all he goes right straight to where the white Throne judgment and all because that's Revelations 20 and watch what it comes down to do there will be both the righteous watch and the unrighteous ious in this judgment wait a minute righteous and unrighteous it says so these righteous will not be the bride because the bride sits in judgment First Corinthians who is the other righteous at the white throne you got your F seal you you got your 144,000 you got your foolish virgins that's why the Bible says as sheeps and goats it's not goats it's as sheeps and goats five wise and I foolish the righteous but it can't be the bride cuz she sits on the Judgment see the bride is with him in the throne as she is to judge the world she has to be sitting in the Judgment with him that is exactly what Daniel saw because he goes back to 3:21 he goes over to over him that cometh he goes right back to Daniel again and right just read it think about it Corinthians it says it do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matter know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more pertaining to life you know the bride of Christ he going to judge angels there'll be people standing before the white Throne that will be given eternal life all right they will be counted as the righteous because they will be made righteous at that point they have no righteousness until then all right you got a little arguments among it into the fal je and the 144,000 because remember the 144,000 receive the same Holy Ghost you do but it just just does not make them Sons and Daughters right we don't care to get into the argumentative it's just talk about what we see do you realize this one that I've read over and over and over is going to show the white drone now why would you have any trouble as to her being liken to the son of man being the word made flesh why would you have any trouble with that shouldn't have all the quotes that I gave of the Prophet to show what he was talking about and how he was the one that said these things you shouldn't argue about the whether or not it's true you should be just simply believing it and saying thank you Lord for letting me be a part of it amen let me be a part of that that you spoke of because remember only those in the Bible that realize who they are are the only ones that amount to anything how many times I made that statement all right well then if you can see that you are the word it's the word that's what judges people it's not you Heaven Help Us we try to judge that's what Paul's talking about we try to judge somebody else when we got the garbage cans worse than they are you see why this has to go over there to show everything is taking a taken away from you and I when it shows the son of man then it is not because remember the quote that we gave is an anointed once in you remember the quote the other night no it's not not that I'll find it in my memory in a minute he said no leaven Among Us brings the fullness of the godhead bodily you know what leing is our old doctrines or any new ones that come up in the message with and when you come up with them in the message you just slow down a little bit and you can find out where they were back there you know that the two Soul Doctrine is based on identically the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence do you know that was back in the Baptist I believe it was they called it two seeds in the spirit would have been identically to the two Lords the two Soul doctrines because remember may I quote brother brandom all these doctrines never developed coming down through these doctrines was in geneses he said there's no such thing as a Doctrine start he said they started in Genesis where when Eve disbelieved Hebrews 13:8 that's your prophet's quote for he said she failed on Hebrews 138 well what do you mean brother we know back read there was a god back there and she failed to believe that he would do what he said he'd do right the Bible says L we fall after the same example of unbelief that Eve fell after just one word just one word just one idea that's why I'm so straight so hard I know when somebody say something to me I said yeah but that don't mat the word now show me if it does I I I I'll be be glad to repent and straight now but you you're going to show me in that word you're going to show me in the prophet's message you're not going to show me with your ideas and opinion cuz they don't mean a thing to me mine don't to you either it shouldn't mean nothing of our idea but what does God say amen I think you understand what I've done tonight I put it with the prophet's message and showed you the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation and and we didn't get to the 20th chapter where the white thron's at we just read it there but you read it cuz that covers it and it shows the same thing and Daniel saw one like unto the son of man just like John saw one like unto the son of man because it was identically the same position of the white Throne judgment what about before he ever starts into the ages to tell anything good or bad about him he shows the church already went to the white throne and shows her not sitting before the white throne but shows her sitting on the throne with him judging why wouldn't you believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ well now I'll kind of go along with you brother D if you'll keep that like in there now you got some reason for saying that that's right you're doubting the situation as being it because to me when I say like unto the son of man and I say the son of man you know for certain who I'm talking about I ain't talking about me and you because we ain't worth nothing we're not worth enough gunpowder to blow us to bits there's nothing righteous in none of us there's nothing in US worth anything it's all in Jesus Christ that's right and if you're not born again you don't have that position you are going to stand before the white Throne you're going to give a de count of the Deeds Done in the [Music] body so no wonder the prophet would say the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most important thing in your life but you see we can go through life claiming we've got everything and wind up up not having anything I'd rather go through a life seeking after it and get there and find out it was already there amen and the finished product how many years have you heard that said it how long have you been around here I've been saying it ever since brother collie was here in 1972 I've been saying that I'd rather search for God all of my life and get there and him tell me so I'm glad you kept searching but said you had me the whole time I was with you then to think that I've got it and get there and he said depart from me I never knew you gu what Brother D I believe the prophet's message may I quote brother Brandon so does the devil okay now you got the old boy born again right if all it is is believing it say we'll get into those where it says to him that overcometh I'll Grant to sit with me in my Throne amen as I have overcome and sit with my father in his throne every age has an overcomer don't you think this is the hardest age of all ages to exist come on musician this is the age of the hardest of all things so then the Overcomer in this age remember what we what we were given out the other day I noticed I said it last Wednesday you know that ever age inherits what preceded them so everything we can cover through that church ages coming from Ephesus up to l oia we don't just inherit the lady oan word we inherit everything each Church age receives that's why this age then called uh ends in the basis of the Bride being the word made flesh the son of man the son of man let's stand what do we got brother 43 in the spiral 43 in thisp book anybody have a need cuz remember it's serious folks it's not playtime pry but can you really say today that within your heart that you are just as Earnest and just as Desiring just as searching after God and wanting to be with God as it was the day you started if not you backlit do you have that desire today that you had when you started or have you lost your desire and you just go into church it won't be long till things are going to change and when it does we're going to know who's who watch what we'll find it out when that World Council of churches starts coming after us and the they can come in many many different ways as a matter of fact if you'll click on I don't encourage anything but if you click on the website and you'll run it through there and you'll start looking at some of the things and you'll [Music] find a man in there but the name of w I believe is his name not certain brother Joe can correct me whatever he knows it's on the internet picture no it's got Jim Baker selling eggs because the world is coming to an end and they want you to store up food all right I ain't got nothing against Jim Baker I'm just saying you'll find him on there this other guy says that they have passed so many laws and they've got everything in order I don't go by all these things that are said but it does make a sensible point he says they got it set now he gave the terminologies he said they can shoot one bomb on the Gul of Mexico and one on the east coast and on the west coast and he said they will never destroy one thing will not destroy a home will not kill a person but it said it will destroy every circuit you know all this light stuffs on circuits all these grids and all said it'll destroy every one of them and the man said it would take 10 years for them to be able to get it back together I'm not trying to scare nobody I'm just saying if you don't believe we're in the end you need to start listening to some of these things and pay attention CU I don't care about their dates and their times and Seasons he said it' be over with the end of this year you know I ain't worried about it because I know one thing for sure the bride will be ready and I'm trying my best to get you and I ready not because of a woman in the White House not because of all of these things but because of getting into Jesus Christ and seeing seeing who we are that's it and what he thinks about us and the things that we've seen go ahead brother I'm sorry Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are F he invites his chosen people anybody have a [Music] need swe to Jesus all the master come you may at Jesus table all the time he who fed the multitude turned the water into one to the hungry call now come and die the disciples came to land thus obeying Christ command for the master called to them come [Music] and else here for David's wife you just reach down there and whatever it is hospital or whatever you touch her father and you make all things well we love you we thank you he's concerned about Brother Gary and he in human life but we just ask you to reach down and touch let that be the cry from the heart of believing for others we love you father we thank you just have your way now in Jesus name anybody else [Music] have ET come and master call you may Feast at Jesus table all the time he fed the mud water into to the hungry call it th come and come and the master call it come and you may Feast at Jesus table all the we just believe it we believe all is well because you said it and we commit it to you now thank you for it in Jesus [Music] name table spread where the saint of God are fed see this is the hour the time for you and I to get right if we're not right it don't matter what we can't claim to believe or what we talk [Music] about we need to get ourselves into the right place me you all of them cuz the day is closing out if not we're getting [Music] old somebody's going to have to step up and take over right because we're getting old enough to pass on well I ain't worried I have no worries about that whatsoever the worries that I have is you and I and our desires to serve God that's the main thing that worries me and it's it bothers me and I'm sorry because I know and realize that the hour is close and it's hard time I understand it understand the pressures and the things the kids that having to put up with the world and the doings like it is and the adults now and all I understand that it's horrible and then our government stepping in and doing all kind of things and all instead of trying to be any help but you know that ain't got nothing to do with me I just realized that as as it was back there that they rose up a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph well that's pretty well what's taking place now so no problems not against anybody but just wanting to move on in God and get out of here right father we believe that you are trying your best to reveal to each one of us not just who we are but the times we're here and what we're here for and your Prophet said that the bride was here to prove to Satan that she would not fall like Eve after his unbelief we just ask you to help us Lord and be with each one be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey let everything be all right we love you we thank you father in Jesus name amen your dismiss He Paid a Debt he did not ow I owed a debt I could not pay I needed someone to wash my sins away and now I sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid end that I could never pay
