[21:18] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[21:21] ate it up and it was in my mouth as
[21:25] sweet as honey and as soon as I had

[22:10] amen repeat the the message before many
[22:14] peoples Nations and tongs that's
[22:17] right habac chapter 2 and
[22:22] verse4 I said if we did our job these

[22:34] Earth shall be filled with the knowledge

[23:19] power in the name of Jesus there is
[23:22] power that lays within your word and
[23:25] we're talking about your word this
[23:28] evening uh and it changes not it's the
[23:31] same yesterday today and forever and so
[23:35] we are just resting in every promise
[23:38] that's in the
[23:39] Bible give you praise and honor in the
[23:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen

[24:23] in the Philippines are also waiting for
[24:26] you
[24:32] okay so brother bham uh spoke about a
[24:36] Revival that will never be noticed it
[24:39] will never be noticed by the world right
[24:42] it takes all it's it's it goes on but
[24:45] it's uh the world will know nothing
[24:47] about
[24:48] it he said
[24:50] it in the seed is not air of the shock
[24:53] uh not not air with the shock he said it
[24:56] takes the spirit of God God to bring
[25:00] life and that life must come
[25:04] out must not come out of just the
[25:07] intellectual
[25:08] Revival it's got to come out of the
[25:11] Bible amen right right a word Revival I
[25:15] like that a word Revival and that word
[25:19] is the same yesterday today and forever
[25:22] right this is not going to be a crowd
[25:26] Revival so we're not looking for mega
[25:29] churches Mega message churches right
[25:32] that's right this is not going to be a
[25:35] repeat of what happened probably in ausa
[25:39] street right right you know uh a lot of
[25:42] gifts manifestation of gifts and but we
[25:45] like that you know and uh and God can
[25:48] still move in know in in in the same way
[25:52] we understand that it doesn't change but
[25:54] uh BR is speaking about a different kind
[25:57] of Revival
[25:58] he said I believe we are living in a
[26:00] very wonderful glorious day of
[26:03] opportunity when people of this
[26:06] day of this day are are are living
[26:10] leaving to see the Shadows of the coming
[26:12] of the Son of God I believe with all my
[26:16] heart that the world is going to burst
[26:19] now into the greatest Revival think of
[26:22] that said this into the greatest Revival
[26:25] that was ever known or it's going into
[26:30] the darkest chaos that's ever been known
[26:33] in
[26:34] history and this this is both happening
[26:37] today amen one happens to the believer
[26:41] correct and the other one to the world
[26:44] that's right you see the world is now in
[26:46] the darkest chaos that's ever known in
[26:50] history amen but to the bride of Christ
[26:53] we are experiencing we're supposed to be
[26:55] experiencing the greatest Revival
[26:58] that's ever known Hallelujah and then he
[27:02] said the Revival will be so small that
[27:06] they will never know it
[27:08] happened think about
[27:11] it they'll never know it happened that's
[27:14] correct you see it amen it passes and
[27:17] nobody noticed
[27:19] it said this in in in this see is not
[27:22] there with with the shop
[27:26] amen this is our importance in God God's
[27:30] plan Hebrews 11:40 I want you to see
[27:33] what God is doing in our midst right now
[27:37] right right before the shadow of the
[27:40] coming of the Son of God
[27:42] right I think you believe with me that
[27:44] we are now at the end of the very end
[27:49] amen
[27:50] hallelujah right at the shadow of the
[27:52] coming of the son son of Son of God
[27:55] Hebrews 11:14 say says God having
[28:00] provided some better thing for us you
[28:04] know after enumerating the heroes of
[28:07] faith those great Giants of faith in the
[28:09] Bible and then this Paul writes God
[28:14] provides some better thing for us amen
[28:17] sure
[28:19] right yes
[28:20] sir you don't think better things could
[28:23] happen but God has provided better
[28:26] things for us right right so that they
[28:30] without us they this Heroes of Faith
[28:33] without us should not be made perfect
[28:37] amen right right think about it and
[28:40] brother brah explained it in this
[28:42] manner uh it's right on our screen and
[28:46] I'll read it sture of a perfect man he
[28:50] said you get it those people who died in
[28:55] here are depending and waiting on us
[28:59] right that's how important what God is
[29:02] doing in this revival this word Revival
[29:06] I'm talking about amen so this church
[29:09] has got to come to Perfection Amen in
[29:13] order to bring the resurrection right
[29:16] think about it those people you name it
[29:20] Abraham Moses amen Enoch all those uh
[29:25] Saints amen Elijah Jeremiah Isaiah the
[29:29] great prophets of old amen hallelujah
[29:31] they're waiting for a resurrection amen
[29:36] hallelujah and the dead in Christ that
[29:39] died before us amen you know brother
[29:43] Venom yes is waiting right
[29:47] now he waiting for a
[29:49] resurrection and the church has got to
[29:52] come to perfection in order to bring
[29:54] this
[29:56] Resurrection they are under Souls under
[30:00] the altar waiting for this church to
[30:03] come to its Perfection that's right
[30:05] right that's when Christ does come amen
[30:09] oh my I like that don't you right
[30:18] Hallelujah and then he says in uniting
[30:21] time at time uh uniting time and sign we
[30:25] find now that the time comes
[30:27] when the trumpet sounds and those
[30:30] sleeping Saints back there that could
[30:33] not be made perfect without us right
[30:37] they're depending on us right Hebrews 11
[30:41] and when they come together they Unite
[30:44] with the living ones the church uniting
[30:48] with the word and then the church and
[30:51] the word uniting together and becoming
[30:55] one the dead saint
[30:58] and the living Saints uniting together
[31:00] to be one and all going together to
[31:03] unite with Christ Yonder for the wedding
[31:06] supper of the Lamb right hallelujah oh

[31:13] thing that Christ is actually uniting
[31:16] with his
[31:18] bride this has to this has to happen
[31:22] first all the dead Saints they're
[31:25] looking at us watching our lives right
[31:28] right and trying to look at the kind of
[31:30] life that Jesus manifested here on Earth
[31:33] when he was in the flesh right
[31:35] Hallelujah because the Bible said it's
[31:37] going to repeat again in the last days
[31:40] so though so th those that Saints have
[31:44] been watching and looking for this kind
[31:47] of Life Hallelujah I believe this will

[56:46] and one stayed outside as a lookout and
[56:49] one came in and started shooting
[56:51] shooting the the minister preaching from

[57:06] more seven more
[57:09] shots before all the
[57:12] Believers talk about squeeze

[1:14:25] scene then he replaced him with
[1:14:28] Joshua there was a change in
[1:14:30] administration change in
[1:14:32] leadership so you believe brother B is
[1:14:35] our Moses
[1:14:37] today he led us out of Egypt land
[1:14:41] different
[1:14:42] denominations but he wasn't able to get
[1:14:45] us to the promised land and God took him
[1:14:49] away now it's time for Joshua to come in
[1:14:53] on yeah
[1:14:54] Hallelujah and when he preached his last
[1:14:57] sermon his last sermon was called
[1:14:59] entitled the
[1:15:00] leadership he pointed us to our true
[1:15:04] leader he did not point us to a great
[1:15:08] man a great teacher he did not point us
[1:15:12] to an E
[1:15:13] Messenger to some Prophet no he said our
[1:15:18] leader today is the Holy Ghost oh my
[1:15:22] amen he even said our Joshua today is
[1:15:25] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah am in the
[1:15:30] lives of
[1:15:32] people that have caught the message of
[1:15:37] Moses and they stayed with the Moses
[1:15:39] with the uh with the message of Moses
[1:15:42] remember the Joshua commission stay with
[1:15:46] the message of Moses right amen the
[1:15:50] message is not for CED people people
[1:15:53] that are afraid no the Lord said be of
[1:15:56] good
[1:15:57] courage Hallelujah take Moses message
[1:16:01] you take this law and don't deviate from
[1:16:04] it to the left or to the right
[1:16:06] Hallelujah but just stay with it amen as
[1:16:09] I was with Moses so shall I be with you
[1:16:14] amen amen
[1:16:16] hallelujah our Joshua today is the holy
[1:16:20] ghost in the life of every believer
[1:16:24] under the leadership of the five-fold
[1:16:27] ministry that's our Moses today amen you
[1:16:31] see Moses Ministry was a onean
[1:16:34] ministry that's why everybody had to
[1:16:37] look to Moses you know Moses raises his
[1:16:40] hands and they win the battle but you
[1:16:43] see Moses was a man and he goes
[1:16:46] weary and he puts down his hand and they
[1:16:49] lose the b battle but they have to see
[1:16:51] Moses you know yeah Moses had to be
[1:16:54] strong for the people because they were
[1:16:56] all looking at him because it was a
[1:16:58] oneman Ministry there's nobody like
[1:17:00] Moses in all the land right Hallelujah
[1:17:04] but Joshua's Ministry is different amen
[1:17:08] you know Joshua kind of organized the
[1:17:12] people you know the priest first with
[1:17:15] the Ark of the Covenant and then the
[1:17:18] tribes you know in order with the
[1:17:20] leaders and then the M musicians have
[1:17:23] their place amen and so uh
[1:17:27] Joshua when he came to the promised plan
[1:17:30] then he gave them their inheritance they
[1:17:32] positionally placed them in the promised
[1:17:35] land amen and I believe that is what God

[1:18:23] Christians that's right that don't know
[1:18:25] how to conduct themselves in the

[1:18:34] do you know your right
[1:18:38] place you know just what to do when to
[1:18:41] do it amen because you know your place
[1:18:44] in the word that's right and this is
[1:18:48] what Joshua is doing now our Joshua
[1:18:51] today the holy spirit is positionally
[1:18:54] placing you in your rightful position in
[1:18:56] the body of
[1:18:58] Christ you know where I find problems
[1:19:03] arise is because there's a lot of people
[1:19:05] in the Mage so-called magees that don't
[1:19:08] know their rightful place that's right

[1:23:00] him what do you think is the joy that
[1:23:02] was placed before him and which was the
[1:23:05] reason why he endured the CL cross
[1:23:08] despising the shame and is sat down at
[1:23:10] the right hand of the Throne of God
[1:23:13] what's the joy that was placed before
[1:23:15] him that gave him such inspiration
[1:23:18] Hallelujah to defy death
[1:23:21] Hallelujah it's the bride amen the bride
[1:23:25] of Christ yes sir amen
[1:23:29] hallelujah Psalms 139 and verse 17 and
[1:23:34] 18 this will blow your mind but that's
[1:23:38] all
[1:23:39] right how precious also are thy thoughts
[1:23:43] unto me oh
[1:23:44] God this is David speaking to God right
[1:23:49] how precious are thy thoughts about me
[1:23:52] you know we think about God but think
[1:23:55] about it God is thinking about you right
[1:23:58] oh God how great is the sum of
[1:24:01] them if I should count them they are
[1:24:05] more in number than the
[1:24:08] sand when I awake I am still with thee
[1:24:13] am oh
[1:24:16] my tell me about you can you can talk to
[1:24:19] me about depression if you read this
[1:24:21] verse right
[1:24:23] amen you
[1:24:25] know you're too blessed to be
[1:24:30] depressed you're too anointed to be
[1:24:35] disappointed am we have a place called
[1:24:37] boraka in the Philippines one of the
[1:24:40] islands what's special about Baka is the
[1:24:43] great beach beach beach
[1:24:46] front and it's got uh white sand you
[1:24:51] know almost as white as just brought a
[1:24:53] shirt
[1:24:54] there
[1:24:55] and you know what you do go to barakai
[1:24:58] some time and take with you like a
[1:25:02] cup and scoop a sand of that white white
[1:25:06] sand white white
[1:25:09] Beach into that cup and
[1:25:13] start start getting one one grain of
[1:25:17] sand after the other and think of the
[1:25:20] wonderful thoughts God has have thought
[1:25:23] about you yeah I am
[1:25:25] beautiful I have been washed of my sins
[1:25:30] I have been
[1:25:31] forgiven I have been Justified you name
[1:25:33] it right and I have been chosen before
[1:25:36] the foundation of the world Hallelujah I
[1:25:38] am the apple of his eye Glory I'm a
[1:25:42] special creature nobody's like me in all
[1:25:45] the world Hallelujah right and then
[1:25:48] after you empty the the cup of sand then
[1:25:51] you do it again again and do it again
[1:25:55] and do it again about the 10th time and
[1:25:57] you won't be able to exhaust the number
[1:25:59] of Sands of the sea and that's why David
[1:26:01] said it's more than the number of the
[1:26:04] grains of Sands in the sea amen oh my
[1:26:08] think about that think about
[1:26:10] it God thinks highly of
[1:26:18] you this is a strong passionate love
[1:26:21] that God has towards the bride amen this
[1:26:25] is a this this love is stronger than the
[1:26:27] love that he has for a child who was
[1:26:30] shamed and suffered and died on the
[1:26:33] cross you see he could have easily saved
[1:26:35] his son from dying but there something
[1:26:38] was something constrained him it was a
[1:26:40] greater force than a love for a child
[1:26:44] his own
[1:26:45] son and that's his love for bride for
[1:26:48] the bride of Christ his love for the
[1:26:50] bride of Christ that's why in the Old
[1:26:53] Testament that's the
[1:26:57] law it culminates in God manifesting In
[1:27:00] the
[1:27:01] Flesh at the end of the Old Testament
[1:27:03] this the Old Testament right at the end
[1:27:06] of it we see Christ coming to being amen
[1:27:10] right Jesus appearing right because he
[1:27:13] is the culmination of the law Hallelujah
[1:27:17] God shows us that Jesus was the very
[1:27:19] idea of the law he fulfilled the law
[1:27:23] right but let me tell you something else
[1:27:26] Grace came in after Jesus came on the
[1:27:29] scene but at the end of the grace this
[1:27:33] is the time that we're living in at the
[1:27:35] end of grace before Jesus comes again to
[1:27:38] Earth again to meet the bride the bride
[1:27:42] will come to being Glory right amen
[1:27:45] right
[1:27:47] Hallelujah Grace is the male part oh the
[1:27:51] law is the male part I should say and
[1:27:54] Grace is the female part
[1:27:58] am male and female together right amen
[1:28:02] hallelujah we'll we'll come together at
[1:28:04] the end oh
[1:28:09] my well we talked about this already so
[1:28:12] I won't be repeating
[1:28:16] it I want to to look at the
[1:28:19] orange orange slide denom
[1:28:23] nationalism you know we talked about
[1:28:26] brandham Tabernacle right
[1:28:30] uh
[1:28:32] uh excommunicating people that don't
[1:28:36] believe the way that they do right
[1:28:38] brother bam said but the
[1:28:41] system not the
[1:28:44] man he clarifies it now not the
[1:28:47] man not the
[1:28:49] people but the system winds them around
[1:28:53] and separates them from other
[1:28:56] brothers they cannot do this with the
[1:28:59] system that they're in they're they're
[1:29:01] under and won't forbid permit them to do
[1:29:05] it that's what I'm against Brethren I
[1:29:09] wouldn't want you to misunderstand I
[1:29:12] know that that's God's truth and I know
[1:29:14] the thing has to die every type Shadow
[1:29:19] even the scripture itself proves it's
[1:29:21] able ab's
[1:29:23] Grace Hallelujah proves it he said it in
[1:29:27] Abraham's Grace Covenant you see it's
[1:29:30] not the people in the
[1:29:32] denomination that's the reason we still
[1:29:34] go to them brother brother Wade when
[1:29:36] brother Wade went to uh Puerto Princessa
[1:29:39] with me we got more than 100 ministers
[1:29:43] about 150 ministers denominational
[1:29:47] ministers and we preach to them the
[1:29:49] message of the hour amen hallelujah and
[1:29:52] out of that I think there's uh over a
[1:29:55] dozen maybe 15 ministers that we now
[1:29:58] gather every month I go there every
[1:30:00] month to tell them more about the
[1:30:02] message hallelujah amen but said it's
[1:30:05] not this it's not the men the people in
[1:30:08] there there there are uh great people in
[1:30:11] there if you think of it where did you
[1:30:14] come
[1:30:17] from Hallelujah there's God's people in
[1:30:21] every one of them amen they just need to
[1:30:24] hear the voice for this day that's right
[1:30:27] Hallelujah right so brother is not
[1:30:30] against the people he's against the
[1:30:32] system Glory now look at this quotation
[1:30:36] now and then maybe I'll close you know
[1:30:38] after a few clouds a a few more
[1:30:44] slides in The Message Church ages seven
[1:30:48] Church ages paragraph
[1:30:50] 204 now now that's the
[1:30:54] Bible that's what the spirit says see
[1:30:57] the
[1:30:57] candlesticks all right now the 13th
[1:31:01] verse said and in the midst of the seven
[1:31:04] golden
[1:31:06] candlesticks one like the son of
[1:31:09] man and then he expounds what one like
[1:31:13] him who was this now we've always been
[1:31:16] thought and we all know that this was
[1:31:18] Christ right this was Christ the one
[1:31:21] walking
[1:31:22] in the middle of the in the midst of the
[1:31:24] candlesticks this was Christ no doubt
[1:31:26] right amen but who was this but said his
[1:31:30] bride amen one like
[1:31:34] him what's now it was clothed with a
[1:31:37] garment down to the foot the Holiness of
[1:31:40] Jesus Christ covering her he was has
[1:31:44] washed us from our
[1:31:45] sins with his own blood right all right
[1:31:49] good about the paps
[1:31:52] a pops is a woman's
[1:31:54] breast not a man brother says it's a
[1:31:57] woman amen with a golden girdle the
[1:32:02] gospel that held the power and the glory
[1:32:03] of God over the body of Christ
[1:32:06] hallelujah hallu oh my I thought in the
[1:32:10] beginning this was a mistake this was
[1:32:12] this was one of those uh people saying
[1:32:15] that brother bam thought something
[1:32:18] wrong and I I I thought surely this was
[1:32:21] a
[1:32:22] mistake because we all know that this
[1:32:24] was Jesus Christ but he said it's not
[1:32:27] Jesus Christ it's one like
[1:32:30] him who is it it's the bride of Christ
[1:32:35] Hallelujah that has become like him
[1:32:39] hallelujah thank you
[1:32:41] Jesus look he said Christ the M mystery
[1:32:44] of God God In His holy
[1:32:48] body no uh I think we we've gone through
[1:32:53] that okay this one sir we would see
[1:32:57] Jesus now here you are a person I'm
[1:33:01] preaching the word saying that he's not
[1:33:03] dead he's alive he's alive and promis to
[1:33:07] identify himself in our flesh our human
[1:33:11] flesh like he did back there see all
[1:33:14] that God was he poured into Christ and
[1:33:18] all that Christ was he poured into to
[1:33:21] the
[1:33:22] church that's him Christ in us
[1:33:28] hallelujah what about this statement
[1:33:30] invisible Union of the Bride he said
[1:33:33] can't you see where we're standing life
[1:33:36] is in the grain again what is it just
[1:33:40] exactly like the same grain that went
[1:33:43] into the ground the same Jesus in the
[1:33:46] bright
[1:33:47] form Jesus in the bright form can you

[1:34:26] in the bride that's right Amen in the
[1:34:28] bride coming of Christ right in the
[1:34:32] bride coming of Christ This is a another
[1:34:35] message terminology that the
[1:34:37] denominational ministers know nothing
[1:34:39] about you know I talked to them one time
[1:34:42] you know I I slept and I said during the
[1:34:46] bright coming of Christ and they were
[1:34:49] wondering what is that yeah what is the
