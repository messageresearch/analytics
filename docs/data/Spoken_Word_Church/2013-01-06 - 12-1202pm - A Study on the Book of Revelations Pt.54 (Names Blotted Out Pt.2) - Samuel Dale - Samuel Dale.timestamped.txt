[35:56] Lord and take care of it we believe you
[35:58] and we thank you have your way now and
[36:01] keep us in Jesus name
[36:04] Revelations one and in Revelation 7 so
[36:09] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[36:11] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[36:13] things which must shortly come to pass
[36:16] and he sent them
[36:17] signified it by his Angel unto his
[36:20] servant John and by record of the word
[36:22] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[36:24] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[36:27] he that readeth and they that hear the
[36:28] words of this prophecy
[36:31] and keep those things which are written
[36:32] therein for the time is at hand amen
[36:36] let's go to Revelations 7 where we're at
[36:40] this morning starting in verse 3
[36:44] saying hurt not the Earth neither the
[36:47] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[36:50] the Servants of our God and before he
[36:51] not his servants right
[36:53] does it save children because Israel has
[36:57] always been a quote to you and get it
[37:00] back later another one said it's always
[37:02] been the servant Nation that's right my
[37:06] servant Abraham
[37:08] it's always been that way all right now
[37:11] and I heard a number of them which were
[37:13] ceoed and there was sealed in 144
[37:15] thousand
[37:17] of the tribes of the children of Israel
[37:20] or the tribe of Judah were still 12 000
[37:22] the tribal Reuben were sealed twelve
[37:25] thousand
[37:26] of the tribal get we're still 12 000 of
[37:28] the tribe of Asher we're still 12 000 of
[37:31] the tribe of Nephilim were seal twelve
[37:34] thousand of the tribe of nasus were
[37:35] stealing twelve thousand of the tribal
[37:38] semian were sealed twelve thousand of
[37:40] the tribal Levi were sealed twelve
[37:42] thousand of the travel discuss our this
[37:45] car were sealed 12 000 of the tribe of
[37:48] Zebulon were sealed 12 000 of the tribe
[37:51] of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand of
[37:54] The Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12
[37:57] 000 and in the Lord had his Blessing to
[37:59] the reading of the word you may be
[38:01] seated we have a few more of these
[38:03] coming so if you will just maybe a
[38:06] husband and wife or somebody close
[38:07] together take one until we can get the
[38:10] others are coming but they're having to
[38:12] print
[38:13] uh on color and that's a little slower
[38:16] with the printer all right
[38:19] now to try not to back up very much
[38:23] into this morning's message but to make
[38:27] sure that we understand and are
[38:31] following it perfectly in order
[38:35] we know that
[38:37] as we read in Revelation 7
[38:41] and then we compared that with Genesis
[38:44] 35 and knowing that uh Jacob had 12 sons
[38:48] and their names are
[38:51] and then going over in the Book of
[38:54] Revelations
[38:55] we found that
[38:57] the tribe of Dan was missing
[39:02] over in Revelations
[39:05] seven all right
[39:06] and then in that tribe being missing
[39:09] we're wondering where it's at and you
[39:12] would say see some people hearing us not
[39:14] knowing the morning's message you say
[39:16] yeah but Dan and Eve from both tribes is
[39:18] missing
[39:19] there was a tribe of
[39:22] I'll leave for him until later on in the
[39:24] scriptures that we started dealing with
[39:26] now the original sons of God I mean sons
[39:29] of Jacob was listing down through there
[39:32] and Dan is within that group but Ephraim
[39:34] and Manasseh were the children of Joseph
[39:40] right all right if remember NASA were
[39:42] the children of Joseph
[39:45] they were not of the children of of
[39:48] Jacob
[39:50] and you're seeing that we're coming to
[39:52] do and to understand a a great thing in
[39:56] the word of God and uh trying to show
[40:00] you how perfect the word is
[40:02] and we had to take this drawing and redo
[40:04] a little bit because and seemingly
[40:06] everybody that had it Sister Barbara I
[40:09] think he had one they printed off some
[40:10] but in
[40:13] doing it they always had the wrong names
[40:15] in the wrong place but you know we are
[40:18] we tried to make them it's correctly one
[40:20] of my out of order that's all right
[40:23] but I want you to look at it because we
[40:25] ended up this morning talking about
[40:29] a very great secret thing
[40:32] and we saw the children of the Israel
[40:34] you know the your sons of Jacob
[40:38] they all went down to Egypt
[40:41] but all of the descendants of Jacob as
[40:44] far as the ones named
[40:47] are you listening like Dan like Joseph
[40:51] Benjamin Etc
[40:53] we read you the scripture there were
[40:54] Joseph died while down in Egypt
[40:57] they were there 400 years in
[41:00] Egypt all right and that way then all of
[41:04] these that we named here they would have
[41:07] been passed on right
[41:09] but you come out with a tribe in their
[41:12] name
[41:13] right
[41:15] so you're driving their night you know
[41:17] carrying the banner on and going and it
[41:19] would be called the tribe of Judah
[41:22] it would be called a tribal Benjamin but
[41:25] it's not talking about the original one
[41:28] of Benjamin because he's done by Stone
[41:31] all right it may not mean anything to
[41:33] you but it doesn't keep me up in the
[41:35] Bible right I know where you're at
[41:39] all right then we got up and we finished
[41:41] on
[41:43] how that they went down into Egypt
[41:46] they came out
[41:48] and when they came out
[41:51] there was 12 tribes
[41:54] all right but then when they get out in
[41:56] the wilderness and camp
[41:58] an amazing thing happens
[42:00] as they camp
[42:03] by that time
[42:06] Nana Ephraim was not missing because I
[42:09] asked you to look it up
[42:11] Dan and Heath Brothers not missing in
[42:13] the Old Testament listing of the
[42:15] children of Israel
[42:17] all right when he comes over the Book of
[42:20] Revelations
[42:23] all right now that's very important
[42:26] because of what God Said
[42:30] okay
[42:31] so then coming to where we were in
[42:33] numbers this morning we picked up the
[42:36] children of Israel after they had come
[42:37] out of Egypt and I was corrected while
[42:41] ago
[42:44] Africa is a continent
[42:47] and Egypt is in Africa I reckon you were
[42:50] calling the condiment no is that correct
[42:52] sister all right we keep it straight
[42:55] what I was saying this morning that
[42:57] there were a lot of Black Pharaohs
[42:59] because a lot of people don't believe
[43:00] that
[43:01] you go to your National Geographic and
[43:04] they'll tell you there were a lot of
[43:06] Black Pharaohs because they would go
[43:09] over and Conquer that from Africa the
[43:11] continent right next to them and they
[43:14] would make their own King
[43:15] you know
[43:16] but now when when Israel came out of
[43:19] Egypt
[43:22] we find them coming out with a correct
[43:24] order of the twelve
[43:26] tribes of the children of Israel but
[43:29] when they got out in the The Journey
[43:31] God is beginning to unfold his plan
[43:36] all right
[43:37] so we see as we were doing this morning
[43:39] so we want to cover these again
[43:42] to make sure that you understand so
[43:46] let's drop over to
[43:47] where we were of
[43:49] numbers should be number six
[43:55] all right
[43:57] this is when they were coming up out of
[43:59] Egypt
[44:00] huh
[44:01] he says it is what's your picture tents
[44:04] every man died on Camp and every man by
[44:07] their own standard throughout their host
[44:09] but the Levites shall pitch round about
[44:11] the Tabernacle of testimony
[44:15] stipulating God is and to Levites are
[44:18] now going to be
[44:21] removed from being called a tribe
[44:27] they're going to be placed into a
[44:30] position of
[44:32] to be the priesthood right all right so
[44:37] now they're removed and they're placed
[44:39] around the Tabernacle
[44:41] wow that there have been no wrath upon
[44:43] the congregation of children in Israel
[44:45] because that was God's way
[44:47] all right and the Levi's shall keep the
[44:50] charge of the Tabernacle of the
[44:52] testimony
[44:53] all right now we come up well let's go
[44:56] on through
[44:59] that into numbers
[45:02] I'm gonna pick up where we were this
[45:03] morning so then you look at your paper
[45:06] this is where they would come out and
[45:08] they would pitch and camp
[45:11] now remember before then
[45:14] you had Levi listed
[45:18] as one of the tribes
[45:21] now Levi's going to be removed from
[45:24] being a tribe
[45:26] he's not going to be numbered right with
[45:30] Israel
[45:32] an amazing thing that I remember other
[45:34] mystical and him they had done a study
[45:36] on the Levites
[45:38] and they claimed that some way that that
[45:40] Levites was the only tribe
[45:44] right now that they can prove of who
[45:47] it's trying to belonged to right now
[45:50] somebody remember that I did they said
[45:53] there was a somewhere DNA makeup
[45:56] right and set them aside that they can
[45:58] tell who is a
[46:00] Levi amen well they can't follow the
[46:02] other lines okay if that's true or not
[46:05] true I've I've said a lot of things and
[46:07] people come on later and say I didn't
[46:08] say that
[46:10] we'll get the Judgment one of these days
[46:12] and find out where they're all this was
[46:13] said or wouldn't say it right if it
[46:16] wasn't said I'd be happy it was said
[46:18] I'll be happy yeah okay either way
[46:21] but now look so you go to the east side
[46:24] toward the rising of the Sun
[46:26] and when you do
[46:28] you pick up Judah so if you look at your
[46:31] paper
[46:32] on the east side
[46:35] you pick up Judah
[46:38] never mind see what it is
[46:40] chew it up is everyone it's good East
[46:43] Side
[46:44] all right
[46:45] West Side Ephraim manasha Benjamin
[46:49] okay
[46:51] North is damn extra that's enough
[46:54] South is Reuben Simeon and Gad with the
[46:58] Levi in the middle
[47:01] to take care of the Tabernacle right
[47:03] all right
[47:04] now to handle all the Affairs of the
[47:07] Tabernacle in the doings is the Levi's
[47:10] order all right
[47:11] you said well now
[47:14] that winds up with 13 tribes
[47:20] see because you want to count Levi
[47:23] but now we went on in the scripture and
[47:26] we read this morning
[47:33] oh the enemy from it would be numbers 2
[47:36] 23 but the Levites which is where this
[47:39] was taken from that we're reading but
[47:42] the Levites were not numbered among the
[47:44] children of Israel as the Lord commanded
[47:46] Moses right the Levites wasn't they
[47:49] wasn't number so you're staying with 12
[47:54] all right yep you're staying with the 12
[47:57] tribes
[48:00] okay the leave out is removed
[48:03] and placed in here for the ministry
[48:05] right
[48:06] okay
[48:07] now if you notice there Joseph is
[48:12] missing
[48:14] he's not on your drawing
[48:19] I'll read it in a minute we'll run
[48:20] around and said there was never to have
[48:22] been
[48:24] a travel Junction
[48:27] right he said well you got to put
[48:29] everybody on that swallowing here on
[48:30] Earth
[48:34] we called in the Millennium you won't
[48:36] have the tribal Joseph listed
[48:41] see you'll keep a perfect order
[48:43] all right so you got 13 tribes now
[48:46] listening okay
[48:48] now
[48:49] what did Brother round say we read it
[48:51] and go ahead and pull that one up
[48:53] brother
[48:54] that's how we pick up that part right
[48:56] there and go on
[48:59] 269 on the
[49:02] 2 Chainz book
[49:04] you can't get it off a number pull up 10
[49:06] that'll jump up
[49:08] 269. look what your profit say
[49:12] now before we pursue this daughter
[49:15] Judas let's go back to the Old Testament
[49:17] see where God did the same thing judas's
[49:20] name remember was removed from The Book
[49:22] of Life okay
[49:26] in Genesis 35 26
[49:29] 23-26 the sons of Jacob were 12 in
[49:32] number and their names were his fathers
[49:34] Reuben Simeon Levi Judah is Evelyn not
[49:37] Joseph Benjamin Dan Napa Gat and Asher
[49:43] all right now here's your original 12.
[49:47] okay with Joseph in the middle no Dan I
[49:50] mean no law a day in his garbage I know
[49:53] dealing with instruments in Menasha
[49:55] because that's not the time
[49:58] I will look these 12 sons descended
[50:01] descendants became the 12 tribes of
[50:05] Israel with the exception that Joseph
[50:07] did not have a tribe named after in him
[50:11] you know after him
[50:13] that was not to be original for in the
[50:16] Providence
[50:18] what is Providence
[50:20] God's way of doing things working it's
[50:22] going to be this way right of God there
[50:25] were to beat 13 tribes
[50:29] now in Joseph's two sons were given the
[50:32] honor of bringing the 12 to 13.
[50:35] you know of course that this was
[50:37] necessary as Levi was separated under
[50:41] God for the priesthood okay
[50:45] that would have been the 13 tribes you
[50:47] wouldn't have one listed for Joseph
[50:50] and you wouldn't really have Levi listed
[50:53] because he's the priesthood
[50:56] as I said this morning then he said what
[50:59] about Joseph Joseph was the type of
[51:01] Christ
[51:02] that's right
[51:05] so then you'd have the children of
[51:07] Israel
[51:09] camping yep
[51:12] three on each side you know for the 12.
[51:15] leave out in the middle
[51:17] and Joseph being the top of Christ
[51:20] go to Levi was to handle the word he was
[51:23] not the word right
[51:25] he was the handle alert right Joseph
[51:27] would be the Christ all right now so you
[51:31] follow that lineman
[51:32] that's when they left Egypt
[51:35] and God gave them a Tabernacle in the
[51:38] wilderness
[51:40] now that's not the building but that's
[51:42] when they made the tent yeah right yes
[51:46] later on it's when they built the
[51:47] building okay everybody with me
[51:51] we find it to try to Levi ministering to
[51:54] 12 tribes May Reuben Simeon it's a car
[51:58] Judaism
[52:00] Benjamin Dan nothing again action
[52:03] Ephraim and the national
[52:05] all right roll it up
[52:11] you drop back and you'll see some things
[52:14] in order of the host that was dust in
[52:16] numbers
[52:17] there is no mention of Joseph in Levi
[52:22] when we look at Revelation 7 4-8 that we
[52:25] read
[52:28] and you'd find no mention of
[52:30] Dan and Ephraim
[52:34] right see as this happened here to make
[52:38] 13 that God put in Ephraim and Manasseh
[52:42] Joseph's two children
[52:45] to make 13 tribes
[52:47] that in Revelations we see Ephraim
[52:50] we find Dan and Ephraim missing right
[52:54] okay
[52:55] with Joseph and Levi put back in right
[53:00] right now think about it a minute and
[53:02] you'll see
[53:06] we'll go into why they were deleted but
[53:08] this is the point I want you to cover
[53:12] as you see once they
[53:17] did come
[53:18] to Revelations
[53:22] Dan and Ephraim will be missing in that
[53:25] part
[53:28] because see they lost now I hope you
[53:30] understand this wording and I hope God
[53:33] understands what I'm saying and I'm sure
[53:35] he does but I won't be satisfied with
[53:38] the way I said
[53:40] once you come to the Book of Revelation
[53:42] you have known levitical priesthood
[53:49] the children of Israel at this time
[53:50] don't have a levitical priesthood
[53:54] you understand me
[53:56] they got a Levi
[53:59] but no levitical priesthood
[54:02] yep
[54:04] that's what you're working on
[54:06] they don't have a high priest
[54:11] they might know whose tribe is who
[54:14] that's why I run around said they can't
[54:16] figure it out
[54:18] they might try to figure it out but they
[54:20] don't have a priest with it when you
[54:22] come to Book of Revelations
[54:25] they had rejected the priesthood
[54:30] not only did Dan and Ephraim
[54:33] go after the golden cage
[54:37] the children of Israel went after
[54:39] everything else right right and they
[54:41] lost their priesthood now here's a quote
[54:45] if you want it I'll give it to you later
[54:46] he said thus we see them coming out of
[54:49] the jewel in the middle coming out
[54:53] and said they had their tribes with
[54:55] denial priesthood
[55:00] so you know how the priesthood down to
[55:02] that you don't have a high priest right
[55:05] after the destroying of the temple right
[55:09] right
[55:12] when they destroyed the children of
[55:13] Israel Rome came in destroyed them from
[55:15] that time on down you don't have a high
[55:17] priest
[55:21] because you don't have
[55:23] a ruling levitical priesthood right
[55:27] you have as the Bible says everybody
[55:29] doing what they think is right in their
[55:32] own eyes
[55:33] trembling over there trying to figure
[55:36] out
[55:37] Who belongs to who right
[55:40] right
[55:41] so you see when you come up and
[55:44] numbers
[55:48] and you come over to the campaign of the
[55:50] children of Israel that we showed you
[55:52] the drawing
[55:56] after they lost that
[55:58] I know how priesthood
[56:03] now you think what you won't do and I'm
[56:05] going to say
[56:07] run around and say it
[56:09] if you don't
[56:13] honor
[56:14] your messenger
[56:17] God will remove his lamp stand
[56:20] right amen
[56:32] you didn't remove the message of the
[56:33] lights down
[56:37] that's only for those who want to hold
[56:38] on
[56:41] but you lost your lampstand
[56:45] the messenger is not here to correct you
[56:48] right yeah I'll have that dope in my
[56:51] face
[56:54] what can we do because the prophet's not
[56:56] here to straighten it out I said the
[56:57] word is amen amen
[57:00] and what he preached is of course you
[57:03] know what he said that's your idea yeah
[57:08] but listen Church
[57:11] if we don't honor that
[57:13] lampstand
[57:16] ing in the correct way
[57:18] which means father what he said
[57:23] his lampstand is removed from you and I
[57:25] right right
[57:26] and look around the message and see
[57:29] that's right
[57:31] they've lost their priesthood
[57:34] why because they're correcting him yep
[57:37] and would that be something to go up to
[57:39] the high priest
[57:40] yeah
[57:42] thank you bruh that's right I mean
[57:46] you're an Israelite
[57:47] and you're smarter and you go trumping
[57:50] into the high priest
[57:54] just remember he had guards
[57:58] just remember it was not the Roman
[58:01] guards that captured Jesus
[58:06] it was the Israeli guards
[58:09] that capture Jesus
[58:12] go read your Bible
[58:14] Romans didn't take him to Calvary
[58:19] they had to finally give the okay and
[58:22] nailed him to a tree
[58:24] but it was the Israeli guards
[58:27] because they guarded the captain the
[58:29] priesthood
[58:31] so it wouldn't be something walk in
[58:33] there that high priest don't talk to you
[58:40] you wouldn't do much talking
[58:44] you know
[58:49] I hope we understand that boy
[58:52] we reject this
[58:55] high priest priesthood
[58:58] I'm not calling right around my high
[58:59] priest but why can't we call it now all
[59:01] right amen
[59:03] but that's going as Jesus what I mean
[59:07] you just lost yet
[59:08] that's right you just turned it down you
[59:11] just lost your messenger
[59:14] we don't believe it was God
[59:18] look God used it man that's right
[59:22] do you turn him down you turn God damn
[59:25] right right amen okay
[59:28] but in the Providence of God that was
[59:31] originally in God's mind
[59:35] he had a plan
[59:38] yep the hell
[59:40] not as I said this morning just Joseph
[59:43] Stanley bowing before Joseph
[59:47] he had a plan to come out of it with
[59:50] the 12 tribes of Israel
[59:54] and Levi in the midst the ministry
[59:58] and Joseph would be a type of Christ
[1:00:01] because the prophet we just read
[1:00:03] that was run out to been one
[1:00:05] right nope
[1:00:07] Dan made these things happen right
[1:00:13] Ephraim International must have been put
[1:00:15] in right to make it come out 13 right
[1:00:19] but Dan and ibram Ephraim was not in
[1:00:22] God's plan
[1:00:23] to remove them
[1:00:26] they removed themselves right
[1:00:29] okay
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:32] so can we right right all right
[1:00:36] so then we find him
[1:00:39] this
[1:00:40] pull it back up my little drawing the
[1:00:43] count of Israel
[1:00:47] so we find this showing it beautifully
[1:00:49] what God wanted
[1:00:51] and have they remained with that
[1:00:53] priesthood
[1:00:56] you and I wouldn't be here right right
[1:01:00] it ain't down in Eastern's fault
[1:01:04] you know
[1:01:09] is the children of Israel's fault right
[1:01:14] you know you know what they should have
[1:01:16] done
[1:01:17] when Dan and Ephraim went after the
[1:01:19] golden pass now that is not the golden
[1:01:22] guy of Moses get that separated
[1:01:26] I made them two guys one put in Bethel
[1:01:28] One somewhere else and under durable
[1:01:31] woman
[1:01:32] you'll find it in a minute we'll read it
[1:01:37] just ain't wanted to happen if that
[1:01:39] happened to us
[1:01:43] you would have had perfect order and
[1:01:45] walked right into the Millennium right
[1:01:47] it was not in God's Providence either
[1:01:52] but we blame Dan and Ephraim
[1:01:57] as I said this morning go back sometime
[1:01:59] and read a little bit about Reuben and
[1:02:01] how he went into Joseph's concubine
[1:02:05] no
[1:02:07] no right it wasn't too good of a guys
[1:02:09] you know what
[1:02:13] we call them today to kind of Trigger
[1:02:15] Happy
[1:02:17] you remember the fellas that come in and
[1:02:19] took one of the daughters one day and
[1:02:21] you know leg withered
[1:02:23] oh they were deceiving
[1:02:27] Jacob didn't want him to kill him
[1:02:30] oh okay we'll take care of it
[1:02:34] Jacob you tell them they got to be
[1:02:35] circumcised well that old boy can
[1:02:39] marry her sister
[1:02:42] run
[1:02:46] when they got through what happened
[1:02:49] well they were so sore they couldn't
[1:02:50] fight they went in and killed them
[1:02:53] you ain't talking about too good of a
[1:02:55] nice guys
[1:02:56] okay
[1:02:57] so don't blame Dan and Ephraim
[1:03:02] that's just an example
[1:03:05] but look at the camp now right that you
[1:03:08] see
[1:03:10] you see Dan still listening
[1:03:16] will it leave out in the middle
[1:03:19] all Russia I'm still in order
[1:03:22] come on
[1:03:24] you see Ephraim and Manassa put in
[1:03:27] and bring it up to 13. or you can pull
[1:03:30] that out God if I don't get to it I'll
[1:03:32] do it later I'm not in no hurry
[1:03:34] see when we finish and we get to the
[1:03:37] gates of the city
[1:03:41] you're only going to have 12 gates oh
[1:03:44] yeah amen you're right
[1:03:48] yep well it's going to be the name of
[1:03:51] them 12 gates
[1:03:55] good I don't mind telling you ahead of
[1:03:58] time where you can read it it's going to
[1:03:59] be the original 12 children of
[1:04:04] Jacob
[1:04:08] and Ephraim and the national won't have
[1:04:11] a gate named after them
[1:04:15] so God can put in and take out and move
[1:04:18] anytime he wants to
[1:04:22] it all right do we have our name taken
[1:04:24] out
[1:04:25] it's taken out forever
[1:04:27] right right so we're not following what
[1:04:30] we read
[1:04:33] was originally been 13 tribes
[1:04:37] Joseph did not have a tribe named after
[1:04:40] him
[1:04:46] that's what I tried to get you to see
[1:04:48] the Bible is so perfect amen
[1:04:52] you don't list tribes until you get on
[1:04:54] over in the scripture all right yep
[1:04:59] they were not the tribes of the Israel
[1:05:02] that went to Egypt they were the
[1:05:03] children of Jacob
[1:05:07] and Jacob and them died down there and
[1:05:10] they came out their children
[1:05:12] oh Jacob
[1:05:15] the children of Reuben
[1:05:22] and then you started to monitoring the
[1:05:24] story of God doing what he wanted to do
[1:05:26] make 13 tribes
[1:05:29] put to leave out in the middle
[1:05:32] and handle the rest
[1:05:34] all right
[1:05:37] would you see him over in Revelation
[1:05:41] as you see them in Revelations
[1:05:46] we only see him in NASA
[1:05:52] put in the place of Dan
[1:05:57] because Ephraim and manasseha were not
[1:06:00] the children of Jacob
[1:06:05] God can do what he wants to again amen
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:09] why was Dan then taken out and Ephraim
[1:06:13] was taken out too
[1:06:16] why was he taken out right
[1:06:20] three
[1:06:23] go ahead remember
[1:06:25] 13 brother
[1:06:28] trying to jump a little
[1:06:30] number 13 which is
[1:06:33] 81.99 of the seventh seal
[1:06:37] I want you to watch real close and read
[1:06:39] with me for a minute
[1:06:42] here's something that maybe you never
[1:06:45] noticed in the tribal calling
[1:06:47] I told you a while ago to read
[1:06:49] revelation 7. read with me and watch
[1:06:52] those those tribes in Revelation 7 Dan
[1:06:55] and Ephraim is missing and not numbered
[1:06:57] with them did you notice that Joseph and
[1:07:00] Levi was substituted in their place
[1:07:02] remember they lost the priesthood
[1:07:05] come on
[1:07:08] you notice that Dan and Ephraim is not
[1:07:10] dark no sir but Joseph and Levi were
[1:07:13] substituted in the place of Dan and
[1:07:15] Ephraim why
[1:07:18] would I done that
[1:07:22] remember God remembers never promises
[1:07:26] his word right
[1:07:29] he remembers or promised him but he
[1:07:31] remembers his curses
[1:07:33] why is Dan missing and then we'll see
[1:07:36] the Ephraim goes out too
[1:07:38] go to the next one
[1:07:40] I got 203
[1:07:44] seventh seal remember this is in the
[1:07:46] seventh seal because he's on the
[1:07:47] background you got for the seventh seal
[1:07:49] right but this is happening under the
[1:07:51] Sixth Seal right
[1:07:53] then I need for Eminem and then put it
[1:07:55] in is doing it under the Sixth Seal come
[1:07:57] on
[1:07:58] all right 203 and we'll go through 205 I
[1:08:01] think
[1:08:02] now if you watch I want you to read with
[1:08:04] me now go order Deuteronomy the 20th
[1:08:07] 29th verse the 29th chapter really there
[1:08:10] is a reason for these tribes not being
[1:08:12] there everything has got a reason for it
[1:08:15] Deuteronomy right we go to it we're
[1:08:17] going to take the 29th chapter of the
[1:08:19] Deuteronomy
[1:08:20] now the Lord shall help us that we can
[1:08:22] understand that you want to start
[1:08:24] Deuteronomy 29th chapter at the 16th

[1:10:31] prophets you understand
[1:10:33] well brother then we're at church every
[1:10:34] time sir
[1:10:36] good choice the devil
[1:10:38] he beats you here because I generally
[1:10:41] get here for most of them
[1:10:47] the Lord will not spare him
[1:10:50] but then the anger of the Lord
[1:10:53] what his jealousy is going to smoke
[1:10:55] against that man
[1:10:57] of all the curses that are written in
[1:11:00] this book
[1:11:01] don't take one word from it add one to
[1:11:04] it see
[1:11:05] shall laugh on him and the Lord shall
[1:11:08] block his name out
[1:11:11] his name from under the heaven
[1:11:18] that's why they cure on Earth see
[1:11:20] under the heaven
[1:11:23] now remember as we talk about Dan and
[1:11:25] Ephraim being removed I have already
[1:11:28] said we will read where they're put back
[1:11:30] in
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:33] their name is blotted out under Heaven
[1:11:36] not in heaven
[1:11:40] if it's blotted out in heaven they
[1:11:43] cannot return right yep
[1:11:47] right that's right right amen
[1:11:51] all right
[1:11:52] and the Lord shall separated to them
[1:11:54] evil out of the tribes of Israel
[1:11:57] according to all of the curses all right
[1:12:00] now
[1:12:04] let's go on over
[1:12:06] 15.
[1:12:09] right up to 11 7 seal
[1:12:12] now I'm trying to do this God have a
[1:12:15] name
[1:12:16] did you notice in the church Yankees
[1:12:20] the same base that serves the image of
[1:12:22] the of dead people so poor trying to
[1:12:24] brought out the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:26] Christ we have Towers his father son
[1:12:29] Holy Ghost
[1:12:30] same thing with that curse behind it
[1:12:32] like that
[1:12:33] nearly from just did just that under a
[1:12:37] hypocritical king in Israel an imposter
[1:12:40] yep
[1:12:43] what happened notice in First Kings and
[1:12:46] 12th chapter
[1:12:48] background and said we can depend on
[1:12:53] enduroboam chicken
[1:12:56] and the man of Ephraim and dwelt there
[1:12:59] and went out in two and built in Europe
[1:13:04] and now if you're a born say it
[1:13:08] unto in his heart
[1:13:10] see the imagination is hard
[1:13:14] that's the other king who turned to the
[1:13:16] House of David he gerb on
[1:13:18] wanted to pull
[1:13:20] away the people
[1:13:23] from
[1:13:24] the
[1:13:25] David remember the kingdom was divided
[1:13:28] at one time right
[1:13:30] and one time it was divided
[1:13:33] two tribes and ten tribes
[1:13:36] David was over the ten Dearborn was over
[1:13:39] the two
[1:13:42] in his arm if I let him go
[1:13:47] to Jerusalem to worship
[1:13:52] and David went over now Luke's my
[1:13:55] kingdom
[1:13:56] so what does he do
[1:13:58] he's getting scared
[1:14:01] how many people might go out
[1:14:03] it's just people go up sacrificing the
[1:14:05] house the Lord in Jerusalem then show
[1:14:07] the heart of these people be turned
[1:14:08] again to the Lord
[1:14:10] even too real for him
[1:14:12] King Judah and he said kill me and the
[1:14:16] rib Odom that's when it was divided into
[1:14:18] the David and durable
[1:14:20] foreign
[1:14:33] behold your gods
[1:14:35] amen but no big money
[1:14:38] yeah
[1:14:39] there is no God's beside you with him
[1:14:42] all Israel which brought thee out of the
[1:14:45] land of Egypt
[1:14:46] he said the one in Bethel
[1:14:48] you know they're putting down this thing
[1:14:51] they're going to sin and the people went
[1:14:53] to worship before they won even today
[1:14:57] you see why Dan and Ephraim is going to
[1:14:58] be removed or was removed
[1:15:02] they went after worshiped in a false god
[1:15:09] I would have been a little smarter
[1:15:11] I wouldn't have wanted a golden calf
[1:15:15] a dog or a cat or a horse
[1:15:20] why would you say that running down
[1:15:23] because this is after what happened with
[1:15:26] the children of Israel was the first
[1:15:28] golden calf
[1:15:33] you remember Moses in the golden guy
[1:15:35] right
[1:15:37] and all them people got took up in about
[1:15:40] 250 priests went in the ground all kind
[1:15:43] of things happen right
[1:15:45] I killed him
[1:15:47] see he's running at Bethel and Dan they
[1:15:50] said the finals
[1:15:51] these went out and worshiped this and
[1:15:53] here we are from down into the
[1:15:55] Millennium age almost
[1:15:58] record that word
[1:16:00] and God still remember that sin go to
[1:16:03] Revelation 7 is almost in the Millennium
[1:16:05] Revelation 7 is not the millennium
[1:16:08] right
[1:16:10] come on
[1:16:12] you're not even considered in that amen
[1:16:15] glory I surely remembers it never good
[1:16:18] promise he remembers ever evil too
[1:16:21] you always stayed with it
[1:16:23] what happened we go after Jezebel our
[1:16:26] name fully removed
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:30] we don't have no hopes
[1:16:33] they set up their idols
[1:16:36] Dan and Ephraim
[1:16:39] went to worship these animals
[1:16:42] God removed our name
[1:16:45] now I want you to think sensibly
[1:16:53] their names and their tribes
[1:16:56] are still
[1:16:58] today
[1:17:00] they are not listed in the 12 tribes
[1:17:05] which are listed as the children of
[1:17:06] Israel
[1:17:09] let me quit calling the name Dan or did
[1:17:16] it all right it's Monday thought you got
[1:17:18] knowledge
[1:17:21] right I can find that quote if you want
[1:17:23] it
[1:17:24] but everybody said they thought they got
[1:17:25] violated
[1:17:27] Dan and Ephraim went over our worshiping
[1:17:30] boy they haven't even a big time
[1:17:33] I talked to God by the way
[1:17:36] I like the people of this message
[1:17:38] turning against the message now
[1:17:40] that's right
[1:17:42] preaching right around was wrong here
[1:17:43] wrong guard this wrong guy was wrong
[1:17:47] you know because God don't strike a day
[1:17:49] Edition
[1:17:51] I must be something special
[1:17:57] just remember
[1:18:00] we'll read it in a minute
[1:18:03] when he said to Moses
[1:18:05] Moses said now if you're going to plot
[1:18:08] their name out take my nap
[1:18:10] he said go on Moses take him to the land
[1:18:14] but he said when the time comes I'll
[1:18:16] deal with them right right
[1:18:20] they went to the land but he said I'll
[1:18:22] deal with it
[1:18:24] Lord are you with me
[1:18:27] not like all these things
[1:18:35] almost in the millennium
[1:18:47] and God remembers
[1:18:51] I'm sitting down to me for instance
[1:18:54] as I said this morning I keep saying it
[1:18:57] you show me in the Bible
[1:18:59] where Dan and Eva Ephraim was taken out
[1:19:02] in the Old Testament
[1:19:05] their names deleted
[1:19:07] or a trial destroyed
[1:19:13] they want to run home
[1:19:16] but God
[1:19:19] remembers right but remember the key in
[1:19:23] what we read in one verse ahead or one
[1:19:25] mentioned it under Heaven look at 16.
[1:19:32] I got 220 and I notice did you notice
[1:19:34] here it was he brought it out why under
[1:19:36] heaven
[1:19:39] I'm not gonna be blinded out in heaven
[1:19:41] brought it out under heaven
[1:19:43] under Heaven there was no immediate
[1:19:45] sacrifice they could give them the Holy
[1:19:48] Spirit
[1:19:48] they'll even see these things
[1:19:52] we did anyhow in his own selfish mind
[1:19:56] now watch but Ezekiel
[1:19:59] in his vision
[1:20:01] in the millennium
[1:20:03] he sees them in perfect order
[1:20:07] if you want to read it
[1:20:10] let's put it down you can read it
[1:20:12] Ezekiel 48 1-7
[1:20:16] he said let's read it
[1:20:18] when I think about it as we read it
[1:20:22] I think about the story there bro
[1:20:26] the children of Israel come down doing
[1:20:28] their Journey
[1:20:31] they were only the 12.
[1:20:33] Sons
[1:20:34] of Jacob
[1:20:36] they come out of Egypt
[1:20:40] as the children of Israel not children
[1:20:42] of Israel they can't
[1:20:45] and they each one came to Levi's in the
[1:20:47] middle
[1:20:49] and they travel through the Journey of
[1:20:53] life
[1:20:55] thinking they're all right
[1:21:03] because God just didn't zap
[1:21:07] remember that's called language but
[1:21:10] it's true
[1:21:12] they thought they got by with it
[1:21:15] you see them all over even until now
[1:21:18] trying to figure out what tribe they're
[1:21:20] on
[1:21:25] right
[1:21:30] but you see God in his remembrance and
[1:21:32] Revelations
[1:21:34] bringing in the Plan of Redemption
[1:21:37] to Israel
[1:21:39] and he leaves Dan and Ephraim out
[1:21:43] and he puts Joseph in Levi back into
[1:21:46] place
[1:21:54] knocked out 13 tribes
[1:21:59] bring it back to 12 for a reason
[1:22:01] because see they're under heaven
[1:22:03] and he said I'll blot his name out in
[1:22:05] heaven
[1:22:07] you'll go into what I ask you to read in
[1:22:10] the church age book from about 265 to
[1:22:13] 285 you'll find this explained over and
[1:22:17] over and over
[1:22:20] are the removal of a name
[1:22:23] I'm setting up and what happens
[1:22:25] all right
[1:22:27] now let's go to Ezekiel
[1:22:30] so when we come into the Millennium now
[1:22:31] we're in the Book of Revelation 7
[1:22:37] Book of Revelation 7 Dan and ephraim's
[1:22:40] out right
[1:22:43] but in the millennium
[1:22:47] you remember the other day
[1:22:49] verse Heaven first and Earth has passed
[1:22:51] away
[1:22:52] verse Heaven is the millennium
[1:22:55] first Earth is now
[1:23:00] well Israel is on Earth
[1:23:03] they got an opportunity amen
[1:23:08] and I hope you caught what I said
[1:23:11] there's 14 tribes
[1:23:13] in the tribulation period
[1:23:18] not just 12.
[1:23:23] and they're put in there for purging
[1:23:27] not only is the 12 tribes going to be
[1:23:29] purged
[1:23:30] the 24
[1:23:32] 000 that we talked about this morning
[1:23:33] are purged in the tribulation amen
[1:23:38] okay
[1:23:41] because they'll eventually see it
[1:23:43] because they're promised to come back
[1:23:46] right not every Israelite
[1:23:52] there's Millions over there now
[1:23:54] that God's going to take 144 thousand
[1:23:57] right amen
[1:24:00] do you want to deal with that other 24
[1:24:01] too so watch what happens in the
[1:24:04] millennium
[1:24:09] to win a millennium you find them man in
[1:24:11] the borders
[1:24:13] let's see East Side
[1:24:14] under the west side
[1:24:16] Look What You've Got look what you start
[1:24:18] off with these are the sides East and
[1:24:21] West Dan
[1:24:24] all right look that's your drawing
[1:24:28] man
[1:24:31] now I'll tell you it may be on the wrong
[1:24:34] Northeast South and West
[1:24:36] oh that does change in the Book of
[1:24:39] Numbers I do know my scripture all right
[1:24:41] that's right I used to preach on that
[1:24:43] because when they when they camped one
[1:24:45] way but when they leave out to travel
[1:24:47] they don't travel exactly right
[1:24:49] because you gotta have your line the
[1:24:51] Optima and The Eagle right
[1:24:53] until they move out a little different
[1:24:54] so many days I'll preach on
[1:24:56] look at what we got in the Millennium

[1:25:11] okay
[1:25:13] okay now

[1:25:47] priest
[1:25:50] where's the priest now the Millennium
[1:25:51] right
[1:25:52] back in the middle
[1:25:56] yep
[1:25:58] he gets his
[1:26:00] Duty
[1:26:01] but he doesn't own anything right
[1:26:05] no Levi owns anything
[1:26:11] he eats off of the other
[1:26:14] right right we don't own nothing
[1:26:19] I Don't Preach for a living

[1:26:58] I guess a couple of bucks anyway
[1:27:01] not throwing off on nobody just showing
[1:27:03] you what I mean
[1:27:05] I believe a priest should live by the
[1:27:07] gospel if you don't have any hair
[1:27:09] inheritance
[1:27:11] I ain't got no Swift bank account
[1:27:17] I'm going to live off the gospel
[1:27:20] okay
[1:27:23] but to Levi she'll have five and twenty
[1:27:27] thousand in the land he's got a place
[1:27:28] drawn out
[1:27:30] take your little drawing and look he's

[1:28:18] that's right
[1:28:21] when you come to the gates
[1:28:24] that's what I said Ezekiel don't just
[1:28:26] cover the millennial layout that's right
[1:28:29] Ezekiel covers
[1:28:31] no Millennial Temple
[1:28:35] that's right

[1:28:42] notice though
[1:28:45] what's your names now

[1:28:50] you only have 12 gates
[1:28:54] okay
[1:28:56] yeah so the city shall be after the
[1:28:58] names of the tribe of Israel
[1:29:00] three gates northward
[1:29:02] one day of Reuben
[1:29:04] Judah and Levi
[1:29:09] yep
[1:29:10] in the millennium
[1:29:14] levitical priesthood is going to be in
[1:29:15] the middle and when you walk out just

[1:30:13] that's right
[1:30:17] it works perfect amen amen the original
[1:30:20] children of Jacob yep
[1:30:24] I cannot place them I'm just an honest
[1:30:28] I could take his word
[1:30:30] he said in Revelations 14 you find them
[1:30:33] in perfect order
[1:30:35] Revelation 14 doesn't list the order
[1:30:41] you know you won't pull that up just in
[1:30:44] case you don't understand it that would
[1:30:45] be uh
[1:30:46] number 21.
[1:30:50] okay
[1:30:52] and this covers the other part remember
[1:30:53] Revelation 14 John sees them again in
[1:30:55] tribal order
[1:30:58] that's right every time through its
[1:30:59] place what happened you remember he said
[1:31:01] under the heavens that his name would be
[1:31:03] blotted out of the tribal Affair as long
[1:31:06] as he was under the heavens there would
[1:31:07] be no
[1:31:08] there would be no more and this 144 000
[1:31:12] is down here in tribal order down here
[1:31:16] and when you come to 14 you're a dire
[1:31:19] that's right what you see they're
[1:31:22] blinded they got all of their sacrifice
[1:31:23] of bulls and go and notice he brought
[1:31:25] them out under the heavens
[1:31:27] with the Gentiles of the days of the
[1:31:29] Holy Spirit
[1:31:30] he blotted out totally right
[1:31:37] this is I said want to go
[1:31:39] read your quote word
[1:31:42] in the tribulation
[1:31:43] he put some tribes in there
[1:31:47] you notice Israel took it
[1:31:51] never an Israelite
[1:31:53] could be purged in a tribulation
[1:31:59] but God knows it ain't gonna do it
[1:32:02] so he went ahead and said it on to be
[1:32:04] 144 000.
[1:32:07] but we don't know that he's already
[1:32:09] saying this 144 000 plus 24 times
[1:32:14] some were
[1:32:19] right where they gonna get their purging
[1:32:20] right man
[1:32:23] in the tribulation
[1:32:28] well if you'll notice in in Moses it
[1:32:31] says
[1:32:31] remember when he was talking let me get
[1:32:34] let me just read this message about
[1:32:35] using them okay
[1:32:40] so Deuteronomy tells him that
[1:32:43] but he said under heaven
[1:32:46] you know that in Exodus 32 and 32. when
[1:32:50] Moses said blot me out
[1:32:55] God says him will I blot out of my book
[1:33:01] come on we better run nothing go 20
[1:33:02] number 28.
[1:33:05] dude we better do that because your
[1:33:08] question
[1:33:10] please thou Wilt forgive her sin if not
[1:33:13] block me I pray thee out of that book
[1:33:15] was nice written the Lord said unto the
[1:33:17] Moses whosoever stand up against me
[1:33:20] damn will I blot out of my book
[1:33:30] right
[1:33:32] is that scripture correct
[1:33:37] you know the same account is told in
[1:33:39] Deuteronomy
[1:33:44] in order Deuteronomy I'm
[1:33:48] this is the same account of Moses
[1:33:52] in Exodus
[1:33:54] make them to me now you know if she
[1:33:58] ain't seen these people the oldest stiff
[1:34:00] neck people
[1:34:01] let me alone I'm going to destroy you
[1:34:03] and block their names
[1:34:07] from under heaven
[1:34:10] Moses
[1:34:12] what do you know
[1:34:17] sounds like an exodus you're saying and
[1:34:20] God says he have got their name down
[1:34:23] and you know he will
[1:34:33] when Deuteronomy is being told
[1:34:37] Deuteronomy says Moses even says it
[1:34:41] or God said demoted
[1:34:44] let me alone and I may destroy them and
[1:34:47] brought out their name
[1:34:48] from under heaven
[1:34:53] Moses would have called that he knows
[1:34:55] what's going on right right
[1:34:58] God said
[1:35:00] I'll blow them out under heaven
[1:35:02] but he says in Exodus I'll blot him out
[1:35:10] to some names are blotted out of the
[1:35:12] book
[1:35:13] and never can be put back
[1:35:17] some of those Israelites that day
[1:35:20] got their name removed
[1:35:25] brought it totally out but some would
[1:35:28] mod it out under heaven
[1:35:32] and their name remained
[1:35:35] I'm reading scriptures I'm not taking
[1:35:37] quotes okay
[1:35:41] see how easily it can be misunderstood
[1:35:48] blood out his name
[1:35:51] from under heaven
[1:35:53] I'll end with this one
[1:35:59] we have the same right today in the
[1:36:01] church at 284 the church age books hard
[1:36:04] to eat in church a names are going to be
[1:36:06] blooded out of The Book of Life
[1:36:08] no names will be blotted out
[1:36:11] of the book of eternal life that's right
[1:36:14] for that is another record though
[1:36:16] contain in The Book of Life you know
[1:36:19] what I love is the last one
[1:36:22] Revelation 3 and 5 he that overcometh
[1:36:25] the same shall be clothed about Raymond
[1:36:29] and I will not
[1:36:31] blot out his name
[1:36:33] out of The Book of Life

[1:36:45] is in the book of mine sure amen that's
[1:36:48] right not in the lounge Book of Life
[1:36:53] and you know their names will remain
[1:36:56] in The Book of Life or else that can't
[1:36:59] be foolish virgins
[1:37:03] how perfect is the word you said we need
[1:37:06] this we need that okay maybe we don't
[1:37:09] I just love to know how perfect God's
[1:37:11] word is amen that he tells me a promise
[1:37:13] and I can defend them yeah amen that's
[1:37:15] right
[1:37:18] I hope you understand what I've just
[1:37:19] went through
[1:37:22] covering how names could be written
[1:37:24] removed
[1:37:26] under heaven
[1:37:29] but not in heaven they're removed in
[1:37:31] heaven they're gone completely
[1:37:35] the Israel while they're on Earth
[1:37:39] Dan and Ephraim
[1:37:41] Revelation 7 is left out
[1:37:44] God can't have his Providence
[1:37:47] then he started out back there with in
[1:37:49] the children of Israel with the 13
[1:37:51] tribes he drops back to 12.
[1:37:58] but in the Millennium it'll be 13 tribes
[1:38:00] again
[1:38:02] and Dan and Ephraim will be right in
[1:38:04] there
[1:38:06] because they sinned on Earth
[1:38:09] and God said I'll block their names out
[1:38:11] under heaven
[1:38:18] perfect Bible amen
[1:38:22] but the gates of that City
[1:38:26] will have 12 names
[1:38:29] the original names
[1:38:31] of the children of Jacob yep

[1:39:08] read the promises of God amen amen
[1:39:11] correct
[1:39:12] the Bible says his promises are yay and
[1:39:16] amen
[1:39:17] which means he can't break them that's
[1:39:20] right
[1:39:23] and we'll find out next Sunday
[1:39:26] if you don't believe
[1:39:30] I don't believe it
[1:39:32] it's not for me
[1:39:39] even a heathen
[1:39:43] who knows nothing about the Eternal Gods
[1:39:46] as we take or God
[1:39:48] he worships a total Pope
[1:39:52] they're up a dog or a cat or an
[1:39:55] alligator or something
[1:39:57] he's got to have faith in that
[1:40:01] and you know what those those people now
[1:40:03] they have some high priests
[1:40:05] they get up and tell the congregation
[1:40:06] how great it came
[1:40:09] you know that element with her and them
[1:40:12] Islamic countries as they die in a holy
[1:40:14] war they get to go to heaven and they
[1:40:17] get 70 virgins

[1:40:21] those people
[1:40:26] we say that's silly
[1:40:29] what is your dependence
[1:40:33] well if this don't work I guess we can
[1:40:35] do something else
[1:40:43] this has done the work before to take
[1:40:45] care of it now that's right I hope you
[1:40:48] follow me
[1:40:50] First Corinthians 11 23.
