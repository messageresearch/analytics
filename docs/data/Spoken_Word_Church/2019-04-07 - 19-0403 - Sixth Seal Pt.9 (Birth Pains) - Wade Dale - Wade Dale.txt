name brother Fred Mullins Church and mother in South Carolina Florence I guess you might think yeah in Florence South Carolina so they'll be back home into the week so good to be here middle of the week get a little bit of work done tonight and we'll see what the Lord has for us you got your Bibles let's go ahead and turn to revelation 6 remember all the announcements for those of you that Jim made just came in birthday party middle of the between services for brother Dale barbecue for the adults hot dogs are just for the kids our dogs are just for the kids okay those this is for the kids and it's not for your big kids for the kid kid but and next Sunday will be extremely challenging because we're going to eat gate to and then we got to come up here and stay here for a couple hours in a warm building so everybody make sure you bring extra toothpicks to put your eyes and keep your eyelids open I'll see if I make it interesting enough to you don't have to go to sleep but obviously I don't sometimes some I'm like brother like brother paints and said I try to get to you before you go to the Land of Nod so we'll see what we can do but we're still on the sick seal this is 9 you see we're going to talk a little bit about birth pains remember next Saturday will be the Spring Fling it'll be at the Guild's Mill City Park where it's always been and just prepare for that also April the 21st I'll be at brother Matthews in Mobile Alabama and every brother or my else am I going that's got the week after that so just keeps on your prayers and I've told you a couple months ago that there is an interval between the sixth seal and the seventh seal there's an interval between the sixth sixth trumpet and a seventh trumpet there's an interval between the plagues and all the different things there's a gap in there so maybe by next Sunday we'll get to the end of the sixth cell and then we'll have a gap I'll be gone a couple of weeks and then we'll able to be able to get started again in that gap because I believe there's something in there because brother Ram says in between there there's a prophet comes on sing Amen so thank God for that without a prophet we would we would just be floundering around not knowing what we're talking about so thank God for for God's sending us a prophet in the end time so let's bow our heads before we get started your Lord Jesus thank you tonight here we are in the middle of the week Lord to get a little charge to get us through till the weekend Father I pray that you would just give us all that little boost something Lord that we can chew on until next Sunday something that we can ponder in our heart and that we can make it become a part of us I just John 8 the book the book became part of John and then John began talking about the book lord I pray that we be that will be a witness that you'll be made manifest in our life and Lord tonight you will do the speaking you will do the revelation part Lord we sang songs we prayed for sick now it's time to hear from you Father we pray now that you just touch us be with us maybe any sick among us tonight we pray that you would touch each one heal them as we're speaking father that the word would go forth and be made manifest in flesh father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord just cover us by your blood we need that every moment just reading what the prophet said about the token we must apply that token and keep that thing over us Lord because Satan surely would love to disrupt this program but you promised that there would be a group of people in the end time that would overcome and that would crush the power of the devil what a wonderful thing thank you for that father just bless us now take care of us and the further one of this service in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld him we opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and all this is nature this is all coming about nature there was a great earthquake that something happened into nature and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind you know it's kind of interesting that that this seal is to Israel and God puts in there about a fig tree we know Israel is typed out as a fig tree the picture I mean so he's telling us it's even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs cuz they're gonna be a part they're gonna be on earth when this is going on 144,000 is gonna be brought out while this is going on alright when she is shaken of a mighty wind and they're gonna be shaken of a mighty wind by two prophets and man there's two prophets gonna just absolutely control nature when we get out of here but you and I've got to go through a process now to where God will take and destroy our old nature amen alright and the heaven departed as a scroll as it was rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men so if you're a great men and the rich men and the chief captains and mighty man you're not gonna make the rapture so I says because they're still there and I can't in that kind of King a man and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man that's kind of everybody that's everybody those people are still gonna be on this earth so they're not gonna be bribed they're not gonna be they might be some food Spurgeon in there but they're definitely not gonna be bribed because we're going when any of this happens we're gone all right hey man we're actually being Gong causes this and that's what we're gonna talk about tonight being being that we disappear from this earth causes not just the birth plane we know the birth pains happening now but there will be a delivery you have birth pains all you want to but there's got a baby come forth there's got to something come out something got to be birthed and said to the mountain of rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb because remember the lamb is the redeemer for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand let's read Romans 8 verse 19 through 23 now let's be seated for the earnest expectation we've read this many many times but I think it needs to be be read again for the earnest expectation of the creature now that is creation look in your Bible it translates that to creation so for the earnest expectation of the creation that we were just talking about in Revelations waiteth for the manifestation of you and me and then for the creature our creation was made subject to vanity not willingly remember Adam sinned and the whole nature fell under him all right all nature fell when Adam fell that's why they call it a fall but the for the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in other words there's another Adam coming there's another Adam that when that when the first Adam fell there was genesis 3:15 I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman in other words I'm going to come back and I'm gonna write the ship I'm gonna make this thing come back up again because that's what redemption is redemption is not replacement redemption bringing up that which was fallen because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God so everything is tied to me and you alright if you're a child of God for we know I hope we do now for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves in other words nature's groaning you and I are groaning alright and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit that's you and I that are born again even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body and man you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word to win or to witness are to understand the redemption of the body and that's what we must come to in this sixth seal purging because remember of the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period let's finish this first set of quotes here just to revisit a little bit it's quote number one from the sixth seal brother Branham says this sixth seal is the Tribulation Period so we know one thing's for sure and I've told you many times before if I don't have any other revelation none if I have no other revelation of what I'm even talking about I know one thing's for sure nice thing about today was Alma over mail route I joy in the fact that I'm born again and I will never have to face a judgment I'm already judged there's no judgment I have to go - sure there's a judgment the deeds done - buddy that's minor stuff I'm not talking about if you miss this thing and go through that tribulation period you will go to the white throne of judgment and you will have a laundry list that you did do this you didn't do that you did do this you didn't do that because the Bible says you'll be judged by your works I never want to be judged by my work I want to be judged by his words because his works are perfect so if I have in that then my works are perfect also hey man that's what to me what this sixth seal is opening up more to me showing that how that God and man are so one that we're missing a point I remember I said before we've always thought maybe we were a little bit Tunis you know it's God over hearing me over here but we know it's costing us but waiting on him to do something are we waiting on him to do something or is he waiting on us to do something and then he knows the end of the story we don't all right so he knows what it's gonna take he wrote it in the Bible there's no other way he could have wrote it he wrote it so we could read it but this seal is the Tribulation Period and you and I definitely do not go through a Tribulation Period which is that that tribulation now sure we all go through daily tribulation Oh y'all don't come to my house come to my house we'll talk about tribulation because tribulation worketh patience we have to have problems and trials in life but that Tribulation Period is the wrath of God pour it out on a godless group of people me and brother Dale with so much other day do you realize that when we leave this earth the Holy Ghost is only gonna be in two people out of 7 billion people why do you think this earth is going to be in such a turmoil you said well it's going to be because the two prophets not exactly I said not exactly because if we don't come to our position and get this thing changed then they're not gonna be able to do their job they're over there now really come on they're over there the spirit of Elijah if you can see the spirit of Elijah spirit of Moses there oh very going come on bride come on bride hurry up we got a job to do we know what to do but we're in there in the Book of Revelations we know we're going to Israel you understand what I'm saying joys are waiting on us brother man says waiting on you and I water adoption time what we're looking at we must come less why's that that you don't see it preach so much but we must come to adoption we must come to where God can talk not with you and you say thus saith the Lord oh yeah brother Ram said the bride will have thus that the Lord keep still I I don't read the Bible where it says thus saith the Lord you say to this mountain it says you say to this mountain whatever you say that's why I said we must come to the place and what I was trying to get to people in the Philippines to see that we are God made manifest in another form where not a second person we are the I am we are the one that walked in eternity now not as humans we know that but I was identified in my and my father my genetics was in the man when he said let there be light and that same one that said let there be light is in you tonight that's the creator he did not become the creator and then he don't create anymore I'm there was some squirrels come to existence from something actually that was squirrels coming existence from nothing amen if you know what Jesus did watch Jesus when he and his life Jesus had to take something and then multiply it took bread took fish took water then we got a little profit step down and says I want you to understand one thing God is now manifested in human flesh and let there be a squirrel come out on that limb and you know what I don't think that squirrel had to get with a daddy squirrel in the moment squirrel to make a baby squirrel you understand what I mean then that squirrel had to eat now it happened just like that just like when that creator stood out there and said let there be a son let there be a moon let there be stars it happened in that same God is not a lesser God dwelling in you you make him less you make him less you put him through a funnel and I because the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of send the guard the reason we come to a place look that's what takes place the bride has gone there's no living creature and then what's that the line ox man and eagle nothing there to say it in other words look the reason this world goes upside down is because there is no there is no grace on this earth and when you and I have come to a place that the birth pain has taken this person and has changed him into an eternal person even in this dimension and the dead says what something's gonna happen folks something's gonna happen when no dead Saints come out of the ground so it's just not gonna be a no no earthquakes whatever you want to call it something's going to happen it doesn't have to crack the graves open listen they didn't have to be an earthquake it that Jesus's resurrection to get to get the stone open to get to to get the stone out of the way you know the world didn't tilt like this so the stone could move no all he don't just twisted his finger in that thing just whip amen that's just way I see it but there was an earthquake nature had to yield to the man standing on earth because at that time when he stepped out of that tomb there was no man had walked like that on the face of the earth and then sure God had come down into into melchizedek and put a little dust on him and walked out and talked to Abraham he come in as the captain of the hosts but that wasn't our Savior Jesus Christ had came to earth he died the Prophet had to die he died for me and you but he didn't stay there the proof of the Resurrection is in you because that same man stepped out of that tomb and said all power and heaven earth has been given unto me it wasn't before he was he was caught in those time dimension he was caught in our dimension he said well we had to sleep he had to eat there was things he had because it was Yuma man he had to be that to be our brother because in Romans eight if you'll read don't don't go to it but in Romans eight before that it says we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ whatever he gets we get at the new birth but we must grow up in adoption to where look excuse me these virtues are God's attributes and when you get born again you get born again at faith you don't automatically get virtue you don't automatically get knowledge did you start as a baby and all of a sudden you're in college no you started as a baby and you come all the way up and you learn by the things you suffered how to do math I didn't because I like math but the English I suffered you can tell that by the way I talk but all these are what those are a victory those aren't overcoming when you overcome you overcome that what that knowledge that Satan gave you that temperance God didn't ever give you temper right gotten Satan Satan gives you all that so what you do is you have to take the reverse of that because brother Brown says so now virtues live a virtuous life well listen we were all born virgins literally we were all born burdens we made ourselves the other way but that doesn't mean virgin life that means power and strength coming from what inside of what God has given you that virtue came out of Jesus he didn't have to go get it somewhere and he obviously didn't have to work it up he did not have to work it up he just knew who he was when he stepped up of that house in the morning virtue or strength just went out from him amen so that's so that's the way it is with you and I each one of these is truly a birth pain we're birthed into all these that's why that's why I love the teaching of the statue perfect man and you know people just think we're right up here and that's just the way it is well that's not true that's why we're been here for 50 years that's why we've been here for 50 years we're not waiting on a prophet to come back we're waiting on us to realize what he's already said about us we ain't got that part fixed yet true we get that part fish we might get him back here but it's all hinged on me and you it's all hinged on what you and I can believe what God's already done for all right but thank God we do not have to go through that tribulation period but that tribulation period comes because you and I are gone because you and I remember when we come to where I read revelation 6 verse 12 and I'll be holding when he opened the sixth seal you and I are not here there is no bride in the church ages here there is no one here with the Holy Ghost that's why it brother Brown says the Tribulation Period is the wrath of God poured out upon a sinless people I mean it's then sending people sinners right we're not sinners I just told you thank God one night one thing I know and I've been it's been revealed to me that at this time I am gone I am NOT here anymore I don't have to go through that tribulation we may have to go through a little bit here but you know what that's just my new from what about being here and you cry for the rocks you you're multi-millionaire you've got whatever you got and all of a sudden you have nothing do you cry for the rocks to following you and they don't you cry for God to kill you because you know there's a wrath that's being poured out like never before listen these wars and things we've had brother Graham said they were temporary tribulation temporary even what Israel went or the Jews went through when when Hitler killed six million Jews that was a temporary tribulation that's nothing that's not not even dot on the map of what that tribulation is going to be cuz that tribulation the sixth seal tribulation is going to be worldwide worldwide nobody no one until God comes into two prophets and brings out 144,000 they're still under this tribulation period amen this whole world is still but now remember there's a time in this tribulation period of three and a half years that they're going to be called out the 1260 days that the Jews are going to be called out 144,000 and then the Battle of Armageddon is gonna happen then there's time left after that until the millennium comes in so we got to be really careful with that to see that we're gone for this whole period of any kind of tribulation none zero zilch nada but God is getting ready to put the world into a millennium he's gonna let that world rest for 1,000 years but if you and I have an internet into our rest here then you know what we're gonna be part of the tribulation and then so you and I have to enter into this tribulation I'm going to enter into this rest that's why Jesus said there's not a day the rest day is when you got the new birth your soul is at rest now what happens though is now you get out to the spirit realm and that's where God's got to work on us regards gotta work on us this is this is your spirit realm he's working on listen if you have the new birth you got gone all mighty inside of you actually you are God Almighty in that soul part that theophany is the same theophany of God if it's different then it's that then it's the devil that's why I said we got to quit being tunas it's not it's not something God putting in you that's different from God it is God that decided to put himself in you amen that's just what he decided to do it I'm just telling you what he said because I think the Bible says and I got it right here I in you and you and me hmm brother Berman said that that day he said that's this day so it's happening in this day this day these scriptures are being fulfilled this day you and I are not prophesying we are living the actual prophecy of the Bible and what the brother branham told us we are living that prophecy because he saw a group of people that would grasp it and it would hold on to it and it would what make it manifest number two well we know that this sixth seal is the judgment seal see it's the judgment seal exactly see we've had the Antichrist ride seeing the church go now it's finished goes up now remember the bride is gone there's no more bride left the rods gone then we see the martyrs of them Jews back there under the altar so much fish sealed you now here's the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgment will come forth 144,000 redeemed Jews now remember they are not going to be bribed they have fell from that position down to servants are they're going to be given the Holy Ghost but look they're not going to be Brian I wish you would really really if you've never done it before sit down for an hour and just don't think of nothing but what brother Dale's telling us about all along because that only happens to his bride now we know there's benefits there's other people that will benefit from this but God is there's not we were talking about this other day there's not 14 different forms of eternal life there's only one form of eternal life but there are positions in that eternal life hello there's positions the Bible says we'll be kings and priests so you got to have something to rule over if you're a king and a priest right by revelations 5 we'll be kings and priests and reign over this earth we don't have a position as the foolish virgin but the food virgins gonna be giving the same eternal life you got not a different one same one but you've come to a position they didn't never come to your bride you're his wife you're not a servant you're not imparted eternal life they are imparted eternal life you and I ha we possess it right here today we don't have to wait on it so I said I don't want I thank God I don't have to wait on get any turn we got it now let's use it to change this body into an eternal body hey man that's the way you'll get changed I'm sorry Abbi I'm gonna stand right here Abby's right in the camera tonight I'll prove you they're Jews and not Gentiles now we are to know that we know that ok the hundred forty-four thousand has nothing to do with Gentiles - prophets has nothing to do with Gentiles all right Gentiles are nations and we're gone we're dogs so they don't even listen to us but when we're out of here those Jews are gonna say hey you lost your brideship but I have come to save you amen because remember they realize that and they say oh my goodness we've killed our very Messiah he said don't worry just like Joseph said don't worry it was done for your protection it was done so I could take a Gentile bride and it was done to preserve Egypt for seven years of 14 years really a famine had seven years of good seven years of famine right that's the type of Christ coming to the Jews the Benjamin group and saying hey Benjamin has gone like hey we killed we acted like we killed our brother you remember they told him in the pit beautiful time there with Joseph and in Christ they have nothing to do with the bride not a thing the bride we've done seen the bride gone so we know in the revelations 19 he didn't mean the book of Acts he meant the book of Revelation he was a human being now notice for the sixth seal is the judgment see all of the word I want you to see that judgment still the word its listen this is not just one day there's a you know God's not setting up here with a calendar and there's a little red X right here little ice well I'm coming back no he's coming back when we get ready he's ready to come back now but he's waiting on you and I to come - what - take that eternal life to a position of not a bride anymore but a wife revelations 19 is a wife look this is the bride this is wife there's your position I didn't hear many a man's on that that is when you first got born again you look your bride and brand new bride and groom you're learning each other it's exactly what happens in your natural life you're learning to love each other amen but when you come up and you know 2030 now me and June will be 40 years this year some of he's more than that but now she's my wife revelations 19 his wife had made herself ready his wife had put on the garment what that garment she didn't need the eternal garment it's on the inside we need to work on the spirit realm of man don't worry about the flesh you don't sin with your flesh boy you don't your flesh can't sin that was born in sin but your flesh can't sin whatever is inside of it makes it do what it's doing God didn't have to take this unscrew this arm off that great beard before sorry some of you did too they didn't have to unscrew this arm off and put a brand new Holy Ghost Arminius no he cleaned this one up he cleaned this up he cleaned us all up amen and if you can't realize that then you need to get morning in you need to realize what God's already done for you my that's the birth pains that we birth planes happen every day to us it should happen every day but there's gonna one day be where we come to a place to where that doesn't bother us anymore brother branham come to places and I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham anymore why he wasn't denying that he wasn't a human anymore he just realized that God had transformed him so much to where he looked more like him Christ than he did his own original parents cuz it's obvious it's obvious he didn't have like his daddy natural his daddy was a drunk right fought fought people bad temper right and I think brother Brown might have had that problem when he was younger oh don't talk about a prophet like that yeah he tried to kill guy try to kill some kids right tried to commit suicide a couple times put the little thing around his finger the string around his finger and then you know the lady said tight ten times he said he threw the thing off and went running after who everyone yeah you know what he done God worked and took that temper that he had and showed him right there that the temperance had been done away with a man but you got to come to a place to where brother Brown then what do you do when he got the Holy Ghost he said I loved him remember he wanted to kill that guy that he said I wanted to kill home table kill the man that remember he gave him a gave Fritz a little button you know the we used to call them poison poisoned his dog killed him he said I'm gonna kill that man I see him on the street I'm gonna kill him that's what he said he said but what do you do he said after I got born again he said I actually witnessed to the man baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ so you know what there's transforming power that was a birth pain the Prophet had to go through the birth plan you and I all have to go through and we're not getting anywhere I was gonna be real short for witness tonight so anyway alright number three the Seventh Seal now what are the age of the Eagle the revelation to be revealed the whole thing now compare this with revelations to 10th chapter verse one through seven and we'll see here in this revelations here ten one two seven that in the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message was to finish up excuse me all the mysteries of God now that's not what the Bible says remember the Bible says mystery there's only one mystery and you know what that mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory that's what the Bible says Christ in not Christ in William Branham Christ in you Christ in you makes you part of that amen and you got to be revealed so what the mystery to me the whole mystery is John top-tall the bride well he's the one that wrote about it in Revelations 10 then John takes the little book John eats the little book and John prophesize so I believe it's John the top of the bride the old bride here's John chopping the bride doing the work says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel but remember when John went to take the book he did not take it out of the seventh angel messengers hand he took it out of the mighty angels hand if we don't get this message to Christ we have lost everything amen I love that I wish we had one of those maybe I'll go to brother Claus and steal it from him he's got a picture a big picture of brother Branham when he some of you read the old indictment book the old book he's got that picture of brother Branham pointing in this direction like this well he's got that picture big like this but right beside of it is that he's sitting in underneath it says only a true prophet will point you to Christ so you can see where he's pointing right straight to Christ all right Christ is the theme of this whole thing not not even ourselves all right we're mad now we find out this is the sixth seal now being open it was for a three-fold purpose all right now what we're going to talk about now here was the purposes three of them the first thing was the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation period for purification we know that all right the five wise in the five foolish five wives left if I foods had to stay and go through tribulation period she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period well that's what the foolish virgin is she's really a virgin I mean she's virgin she's come to a place to where she thinks he's clean and got the Holy Ghost but she doesn't have the Holy Ghost that's why she has to go through the tribulation but she'll be given eternal life for what she stands for and the tribulation period she will be killed because that's why this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter that she had been purged and she had been given her robes all right now now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets false message preachers and they didn't get a chance and yet there's really since they're in heart and God knows our heart that's the whole thing God knows your heart and here they're purged during this time you notice that another purging time that's for Israel when she's gathered that's the second fold of the second 2nd thing God purges Israel in the tribulation period now not all of Israel out of the millions that will gather there now remember they're all gathering to the homeland looking for the Messiah but only 144,000 is going to know that the Messiah's already come that's the second fold God purges Israel in the tribulation period out of the millions that will gather there there'll be a selected 144,000 and they'll be purged also God's purging Israel why because of all the things they did rejecting them at the cross and all those different things let his blood be on us and our children they they fell from being bride but they do get a position that's in this one telling about they they fell from one position to another position but they're still gonna get eternal life but they're never gonna be able to be bride okay but they'll have eternal life notice there's a whole earth now this is number three there's a whole earth to be is to be purged there'll be such a thing that the moon stars at all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the Millennium is coming up and see everything that's got it filth in it has to be purged during the sixth seal because listen when we're when we're gone God for three and a half years is going to he's going to pour out tribulation on the whole world then in the middle of 70th weeks about Armageddon so brother Burton says the Battle of Armageddon well after the Battle of Armageddon well what's the Battle of Armageddon it's all heck breaks loose the whole world goes into an atomic chaos right but we come back into millennium it's cleaned off enough for Christ to come back and put his feet on the earth but I believe this is just me this is my this is my quote I can't find one more brother Brown said it but I'm just gonna say it this way the reason Christ can come back is because we've already stepped here in glorified bodies hello we've already had a body change way before that way before the Millennium Stars let's just say we all get a body change tomorrow well crock still can't come on the earth right remember we meet him in the air with our glorified our glorified eternal boy that ought to make old people having a horrifying eternal body a man then we meet him in the air go to the marriage supper while all this is going on wedding supper and while this is all going on then we come back with him in Revelations 19 as the wife coming back into the Millennium to live the thousand years but you know what means nothing to us but if Christ is coming back with us and he's got this whole group of seven Church ages they've all got their body changed he's had a body change the long time ago but now he's being able to step into this dimension because you and I as recipients of the perfection of Christ year what I'm saying as recipients of the perfection of Christ we're already on this earth cleaning it off when we leave that's fine when we leave this this world's going hey hey he forgot us this thing needs to be changed and all we gonna do is say hey we'll be back don't worry let me clean all this sin off let it burn all this junk off for a little while we'll come back but remember as brother Dale's been preaching even the millennium is not an eternal position it is for us but this world is not completely eternal at the time it's just us that walk on it cuz we're God can't be y'all at all cuz you got dead Saints that lived not for a thousand years you got the foolish version you've got a cup of water in my name you've got all those ones that are dead that's got to come up to the white throne judgment well then he's not all in all he's all in all in his bride he's all in all in 144,000 and the fifth sealed you but not the whole world then the whole world's got to be judged at the white throne judgment but oh thank God we don't have to stand in that we're standing in the judgment not being judged oh man come on people good grief whatever you do sure repent get it over and get it done with but you can't sin enough to be lost if you're born again a man I notice worth Aaron they don't stir you soup you babies fell out of your bowl I finally said it anyway what was I notice there's a whole earth to be purged it will be such a thing as the moon I remember when I see that word earth you know if those evenness been heard me many many many times when I see earth that word earth I don't think of this round ball that we're sitting on standing on cause death Earth's got to be changed first this Earth's got to go through birth pains this earths got to go through an earthquake amen this earths got to go through a purging you and I must come that six Neil Peart is so sanctified till it sanctifies that outside person you're sitting in right now amen it'll change it back young cuz what's inside of you is young already I hope you understand that when I look at you I don't look at age I look at a 20 year old person district Lena you laugh oh you won't - I don't see her as an old person I see her as a young vibrant Lea you said well get up on the bed and you'll know that that sense that circumstance is in this dimension we gotta let that thing it's inside of us out our stinking thinking's wants putting us in the grave okay okay so the world the whole earth so you and I have to go first because the whole world is waiting on you and I I read that revel in Romans waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God so that you and I will come to a place to where your body will yield to what's inside of it that's what's gonna happen your theophany is not hanging in heaven somewhere you are your theophany you are that Holy Ghost inside of you that is your theophany and it's not the soul away Dale anymore it's a soul of Almighty God we just haven't been able to believe that yet I'm just telling you what he said what's gonna happen let's look at this next quote we all know that's the identification we know what the third pulley is when that we're gonna read another quote for brother Ram we know the third pole is the opening the word the third pole with the opening of the seven seals all right this is 1964 we all know that's the identification we know what the third pole is we all understand that I doubt that at that time but we should now more understand it than ever because look come on people the third pole is not a it's not an event of a tent or an airplane I'll tell you what he said it was right he was opening the word it's a word pull it's the third pull what pulling you is the word of God not some event we all understand that because watch if they listen if the third pop will let's just read it now you got you have the tape I think it'll just lay dormant for a while hmm now the third pulled open any of the word that can't lay dormant but the manifestation of it can alright because the third pole is what's gonna get us out of here that's what's gonna get us out of here the opening of the word is what's gonna get us out of here the third pole is going to be what speaking the word and stuff comes to pass cuz what at what brother Brown towel that too he tied it to the fish he tied it to the squirrels he tied it to had he right he tied it to sister meter all those five things that went that happened was because of what he said and another not an event sure we had events we had the cloud we had the picture and all that that's not what he put it on he put that third pole on the opening of the word amen and I think that it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour persecution now that our persecution is not here oh yeah we got a little minor persecution I'm talking about that's when it be it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly now I think just wait see what it done now I'm going back same again through and through to find out in other words he's going back to Jefferson villain thinks what he was doing but I was go the next one I'm just telling you what he said now remember notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on in other words not in the healing campaign that was not the prophets message right it was not his message it was debate on the hook he wanted you to get the hook not the bait but you have to have bait on the hook now went not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message now that's the opening of the seals cuz I'll fear oh well here it is see the first pool healing that was the first part of his ministry second pool prophesying what take people by the instead of taking him by the hand he was stick there and tell them what was in their heart third pull the opening of the word what the seals the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than profit so we hadn't have a profit in the end time but the only way the profit can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pole was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it congregation says they man I doubt they did but anyway we see it we should we're recipients of that everybody all right with that you are the recipient of that I read you about ten times during this whole seal seal series where brother Branham said it's gone from you it's not for you you're not supposed to get it he's talking about them on questions and answers he said just go and live a simple life it's not for you well it's got to be for somebody because God don't just cast his word on it it will not return void it will accomplish what it said well the accomplishment is now you and I now have seen those seals open and we see we see the Thunder underneath the seal that it's not just the white horse riders the Antichrist it's not just a red horse rider than Chanukah no it's the plan of redemption it's the full plan of redemption not just the born-again experience but the full man the full when the seventh seal is revealed that's God standing on earth in human flesh your flesh he's not gotta flesh on earth besides you alright let's look at this real quick flip all right roll it up to the next one so let's just look we did this last Sunday or the outlier Sunday so let's just back up just a minute FIF seals justification we look and see that now what is justification justification is what the real you didn't do it not just now look baby form justification is that God forgive you of your past sins he has justified you but old root of evil is still there that's not what this we're up higher now everybody okay with that I know something's not been here I'm trying to go back through a little bit but baby form justification is God's chopped off your past sins never to remember me any more but the next day you're going to keep sending because the same old root of evil is still there and then but God is just to forgive you as if you didn't do it then when you become sanctified in baby form sanctification and justification baby for him brother Brown said God picks the glass up called you wants to do something with it alright why does he do it sanctification he washes it out clean and set aside for service amen if he cleans and set aside for service then what's he going to do he's going to come in by the Holy Ghost in fire he's going to put something in that glass and seal it that's why there's only one seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption all right if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't understand what I'm saying anyway and then so you got to have the Holy Ghost the one that's the one that's talking to you tonight it's the same one that wrote the book I'm not talking about me I'm talking about if I quote you the word that's the word quoting the word but this justification is not as if you didn't do it it's not just chopping off your past then no we've come to a justification where that fifth seal Jew God had to completely wipe their slate clean and they didn't even want it what about grace you and I one day we don't want it remember you didn't go looking for God God come looking for you and what's the first thing we did right but he caught you because he wants you to come to a place of this justification in this fifth seal justification where the real you didn't do it anyway tell my grace he gave me eternal life to a fifth seal Jew that did not even care he was on the earth the Messiah they were killed under Eichmann and Hitler just because they were Jews not because they were religious not because they knew the message of the hour they weren't even born again but God had to blind their eyes purposely so that you and I could come in a man so he gives them eternal life he so justifies everything they do to where excuse me they have white robes think about that that that's not just as if you didn't do it the real you didn't do it them inside of the inside never send a Danish life but do we realize that and then this six self sanctification what is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service something's got to be cleaned and set aside before the Millennium can come amen something's got to be clean and set aside before you get a body change because remember I said this thing don't sin it doesn't but it is sinful it was born in sin it was shapen in iniquity came the wrong way amen but you know what God's gonna do with the Holy Ghost and fire when that seventh seal hits the earth he's gonna burn every molecule that you got from your mom and Daddy and change you not at everybody same body it'd be real easy to throw this one away and get you another one but that's not Redemption that's replacement listen when the Prophet stood one day and he said God took this one and bred him to this one he took this one and bred him to this one took this one and bred them to this one just to get you here think of how you came just think think back how you can't think about how your mama came hey your mama's mama how your daddy's mama how they all met just to get you here because there was an image there was an image in God's mind he was going to have it it didn't matter what you might have somebody lives over here and somebody lives over there and they were telling me a story in the Philippines I'll not go through it for say time but it was just miraculous how they got together hated each other's guts got married and had a preacher that was standing there I thought well my take two people hate each other humanly but then they fell in love and had him and then here he is a wonderful message preacher in the Philippines I mean you know I'm God works in mysterious ways but he but he did he listened God's got this whole thing he had to bring your image that's what he saw before the foundation world he's got to bring it here he's got to bring it here because you're his children now we know he had to come through flesh we know we had to come through that because why because the fall but look right here we got to believe that we are him brother BAM I'll read the quote she is him now remember there is no way even after 40 years of marriage June and I if we went to the doctor and they took a DNA test they would see two separate people because my DNA is different from hers because she came from her parents and I came from mine right but now we got to go back to Adam and Eve we got to go back to Adam and Eve where you took Adam if you could take a hair from Adam and a hair from Eve put it under the microscope and and the scientists would go there's no way there's no way these two people can have the same exact DNA because the Bible says we'll have a body like unto his glorious body we will be changed in our DNA not to change our shape but to be to be him she is him she's not like him The Devil's like him she is him who I said with we're not the I am would probably be I was or they I'm gonna be but I like I am ever-present for eternity all right let's read a couple quotes here I'm not gonna get finished between the one I got Sunday I love this thank your brother Dale let's read this watch this right here that's what he proved hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word was he something else no but he was God himself now watch now we can say amen to that but can you put your name in there yeah can you read the Bible where it says then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and not think of Jesus it's you he's the first fruit he's already done his job and he's left he's come back to give you that scripture because if it's I and you and you and me hey listen let me get back to my point here just a second there's no way that Jun and I can be one as that is one we're always different DNA because God had to breed this woman to this wood listen listen listen listen to get you air because of the sin curse because of the natural between husband and wife coming together and having a baby all right but still I submit brother Graham said that's more a miraculous than the virgin birth when you've got billions of cells released and meant in many eggs release and then here you are all the rest of them died except you the virgin birth was God created an egg and sperm put it in a woman that was pretty simple but to get you here think about it don't think of yourself as something special but you are something special you got brought here special we all got here the same way but but we were still special in God's eyes but he was God himself the dynamics in the word don't you listen this real clothes that made the body of Jesus Christ because remember like I said if we're going back to the Garden of Eden we got to go back to where our DNA is the same as his husband and wife are truly one listen Adam and Eve were definitely one they were one her DNA and his DNA you put them under that look fitting but see you can't you can't ever do that now because we come from separate DNA our DNA comes all the way down from one side of the family and the other well not with Adam and Eve they were created God's gonna create again he's gonna create again he's gonna put us right into the position we were supposed to be had there not been a fall that's redemption redemption that's not taking this and dropping it down here and then putting it over here if it fell from here that's where God's got to put it back if it fell from right here which with Adam and Eve one same DNA same theophany thank the orphan II mm-hmm that's what brother Graham said shake into life and rise again roll away the stone that look the body of Jesus Christ now on Saturday his body was cold stiff dead and in the grave amen shook him to life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead till the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead all nature said he was dead what are we talking about nature and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only in the mechanics God's Word he was the dynamics to prove it excuse me and as he being the groom listen list as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's a second person of him Oh cuz it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the full filling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride the whole Bible speaks of you listen I told you many years before you're not a type you're the bride Oh everything types the bride in the Bible but you are the bride you're not a second person it can only manifest all the revelations others have spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh Adam said that before the fall he looked at him and he said she is flesh of my flesh bone of my bone life of my life power of his power she is him as man and women are what woman are one excuse me that tape didn't say I didn't say women woman you only have one wife as man and woman are one why would you want another one and man and woman are one and woman taken from his side where were you and I taken from the side of Christ at Calvary she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side and made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of Hey and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics until the church or the people until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride a man for he said in John 14:12 he didn't believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it there's your birth pains the world can't hold us here and I will raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you won't do and deny this word it won't do you any good you're just cranking around the Pistons got the spark there but no gasoline to fire it'll only work as they come together amen so one will sell set still and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it in other words the church will stay here and abroad will go up yet they both look alike both claim to be churches both claims to be bride but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it to pass of what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes the combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever we're gonna literally explode what's inside of us can't hold what's on the outside we're gonna literally explode and we're gonna see all this not too far not too far in the future we're not we're looking right at it now we just got to get we just got to get some things in all here okay that all right all right let's read this right here number seven I've been going pretty good so much don't even a 30 yet that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh now this is the rising of the Sun it's a Content it's not a continuation it's down a little bit further paragraph 168 what is the divine revelation of the word made flesh he'll tell you right there that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in that day by the Sun the groom it's the flesh today by the bride we have spent 50 years trying to get this flesh lined up when these little devils going on inside and this thing gonna ever do you any good this flesh yeah do you understand your Flash don't sin your flesh don't sin the motivator inside of it does it I don't hold a beer anymore I still got same hand you got same mouth say some really bad things out of it i'ma tried one time to wash it out with soap that doesn't really do any good it's kind of temporary but once I got she did but once I got the inside wash battle ouya once I got the inside wash she didn't have to wash my mouth anymore God washed it he watched it by the new birth so it's the flesh today by the bride who soever sins you're a mental or brother branham goodness gracious because remember I think before this there was a woman remember after the marriage and divorce situation brother branham this woman comes up and says you made yourself God you forgive them of their sins he's telling the truth whosoever sins you remit are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them are retained you know my example of that you know when we walked through the world how the world gonna be judged they're gonna be judged by you you will judge the world and whosoever sins you remit their remitted God changes your tire he don't really care anything about the Lord he just does you a good favor and then we get over to the other side God gives them eternal life because you're gonna sit there and you're gonna say Lord you said a cup of water in your name on earth will not be forgetting forgotten in heaven well whose remitting the sin we know Christ is but through you that person will get eternal life but now it works the other way too whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained be careful now the Catholic Church picked it up and takes it to the priest but that's carnal watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it not an emotion but the spiritually revealed word that did it alright man seeds not air with a shock let's read this and I'm gonna stop right here because I'll pick it up Sunday that all right then Along Came sanctification how many believes in sanctification sure clean and set aside for service brother branham hmm he's not talking about that anymore watch what he's saying down here he's not talking about that saying that we're not talk about that sanctification anymore listen if you've got to be sanctified like the first part of sanctification you're still dirty on the inside this sanctification is going to so clean this guy and Along Came sanctification have you believe in Santa case you do you believe a lie Bible you have to sure so still that's not it's a little more like that's two more words but then come to Pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence speaking in tongues there they call the initial evidence which brought forth the what the shuk but they denominated but when you I want you to make that personal you when you Bob black comes to say and my father are two now how close was how close was Jesus and his father he was the father made manifest in human flesh when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things like the I am we're talking about then the shuk pulls away because you know what you can set up stand up here and you don't need discernment when you start preaching and get it so close to where we say the I am where that we say we came from God we go back to God what we saying the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when we point it to not me myself person but to us as the bride it makes a lot of you nervous it made a lot of people in the Philippines nervous why they'd never seen it that close you either gonna see it that close or the shirts gonna pull away cuz look the shucks can't stand being because it is not the real brain I'm just telling you what brother Brennan said then the shucks pulls away from it what from the people that say I my father won and these other things but the real genuine bride Church will bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever hey man let's go to number 10 and I'm gonna stop right there and I'll pick it up Sunday right here in birth pains that all right we'll be done right here musicians get ready to come notice quickly now this is in birth plans no notice quickly now she is in that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt where in the loudest in church age so beyond a shadow of a doubt we're still in the layout is injured yeah okay now we've been birthed out of the age but we're still it you got to go home in your layout and see a car you got to turn your layout see an air conditioner on and you got to turn you allowed to stay on Netflix we're right where's Lois when I need him now her messenger is promised I love it Malak on the 4th chapter so what's he doing he's identifying who what he's talking about because remember listen folks no disrespect God had to speak to brother Branham but we even when brother Branham was I was just reading it where he was baptizing 500 people that angel never said you would bring the second coming the crime in every quote he said the angel says your message will forerun the second coming of Christ your message sure it had to come through him but you and I are that message without that it's just one person you and I are that we're the recipient and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth don't look not a new birth to make it different you've still got to go through justifications thinking about sending Holy Ghost but there's no other people in the world have ever brought justification up to the part that brother Browne did nobody is brought sanctification up to the war part brother Brown talked about he nobody has ever opened that Seventh Seal and showed you that the Holy Ghost is going to change your body sure we read it in the Bible and we hear a prophecy but you are a recipient of that birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 in the church world today there's two systems working in the message church there's two systems working in the church world today there's two systems working now listen real close listen say it's not out there he's here he wants to disrupt this he don't want to disrupt that he wants to disrupt this so he gets the church before you do he's here when you're not and he leaves off you leave well actually he leaves with you now I want to see if you're going to say Amen on this okay there are two systems working the church world today I'm gonna get this off my shoulder I think I just did that and then I have it over with we all know that that's the Word of God and the denominational system there is the two systems at work just as they was Jacob and Esau one after the spirit the other after the flesh come in you got all that fleshly emotion and all that but you've got the people that love the Word of God and God anoints the word and then signs have to follow signs have to follow up believers believers don't follow signs I'm telling you no I told y'all a long time ago you just wait somebody's gonna raise up and have all kind of signs and wonders and people are gonna flock all afternoon like crazy and if you're not grounded in the word you'll go to because it ain't gonna matter what he says you just want to see the prayer lines and the healings and all back to what brother Branham did that's gone that's carnal reformed I read that to you a long time ago brother but I said that's not even supposed to be this way I read you the quote Paul says leaving the principle was the doctrine of Christ of laying on of hands and of baptism what go on to what perfection sure we're perfected in our soul y'all come on musicians come on but you and I are recipients of the whole book we're recipients of ever revelation every mystery that's my brother mom said them the mystery is now history why you're the mystery I thought if Christ was a mystery and if Christ is in you that makes you the mystery listen we're a mystery to the world I hope you're a mystery to the world it's like I told you about that brother this came and sitting down at our ministers meeting there in the Philippines he said I've never met a denomination like you well I'm glad he saw a difference I said we're nondenomination I said we believe you no we don't believe that we don't believe only our head ships Christ and I'll follow up on that because brother whales back in the Philippines now so maybe I'll follow up on him what happened with that brother so let's stand their feet god bless you the word is made flesh in
