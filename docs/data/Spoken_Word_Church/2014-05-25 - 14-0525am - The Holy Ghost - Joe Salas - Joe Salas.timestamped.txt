[0:07] oh I found out one thing for
[0:10] sure you want to have patience get a
[0:13] buddy pass from
[0:18] Benny
[0:21] morning it's the's time and brother Jo's
[0:23] time that's righted in my face big time
[0:26] you ever have to spend the night in in a
[0:27] u it's all airport yeah it's all
[0:32] uh last time I was talking about uh the
[0:34] token which for Israel was the token was
[0:37] a to kill the lamb and put the blood on
[0:40] a land and door post but uh that that
[0:44] was just a type of the Holy Ghost uh but
[0:46] today that won't work for us we've got
[0:48] to have that fullness of uh of the Holy
[0:52] Ghost Jesus God himself had to to come
[0:56] and
[0:58] die
[1:02] you got to talk over the
[1:05] fame God himself had to die on the cross
[1:09] for us uh so uh brother brother B
[1:13] preached uh very many messages on Holy
[1:16] Ghost uh what is the Holy Ghost what was
[1:19] the Holy Ghost given for question and
[1:21] answer on the Holy Ghost and
[1:25] uh did you guys know the whole Bible of
[1:28] the Holy Ghost yeah that's right
[1:31] yeah but we have to prove about the
[1:33] scriptures so uh second Peter 1:21 says
[1:38] for the prophecy came not in the old
[1:40] time by the will of men but holy men of
[1:43] God expect as they were moved by the
[1:46] Holy Ghost
[1:48] right okay let's go to acts uh
[1:53] 7 start at
[1:55] 1 1 through uh
[1:58] 8
[2:10] then said the high priest are these
[2:12] things so and he said men and Brethren
[2:15] and Father's hearken the god of Glory
[2:18] appeared unto our Father Abraham when he
[2:20] was in Macedonia before he dwelt in Cher
[2:24] and said unto him get thee out of thy
[2:26] country and from thy Kindred and come
[2:28] into the land shall show thee then he
[2:32] came out of the land of the children and
[2:34] dwell in ch and from then when his
[2:37] father was
[2:38] did he removed him into this land where
[2:41] he now dwelt and he gave him none
[2:44] inheritance and it not so much as to set
[2:47] his foood on it on it yet he promised
[2:50] that he would give it to him for a
[2:52] possession into his seed Not seeds seed
[2:57] which is one that's right after
[3:01] him and when as yet he had no
[3:05] child and God spake on this wiv that his
[3:08] seed should were sojourn in a Strange
[3:12] Land and that that they shall bring them
[3:14] into bondage and and treat them evil for
[3:17] 100 400 years and the nation to whom
[3:21] they shall be in abundance will I judge
[3:23] said God after
[3:27] that there shall they come forth and
[3:30] serve me in this place and he gave him
[3:32] the Covenant of circumcision and so
[3:36] Abraham beg got Isaac and circumcised
[3:38] him the a day and Isaac begot Jacob and
[3:43] Jacob begot the 12
[3:57] patriarch in the message the what is the
[3:59] Holy Ghost brother said and that's the
[4:02] way we receiving the Holy Ghost he said
[4:05] you got to know what what you're coming
[4:07] for and how to receive it and what it
[4:12] is he said uh now the first place the
[4:16] Holy Holy Spirit has been promised mhm
[4:20] he said now I want to talk on it as the
[4:22] holy spirit being a sign where is the
[4:25] sign we realize that all promises is
[4:27] given to us by Abraham
[4:30] was the father of the promise because
[4:32] God gave the promise to Abraham and to
[4:34] receed after him the promise was made to
[4:38] Abraham and to his seat and this is sign
[4:41] is to a covenant people amen uh let's go
[4:47] to acts
[4:50] uh 7 but we're going to go to 51 verse
[4:58] 51 he said uh you stiff necks
[5:01] uncircumcised and heart and ears you do
[5:05] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[5:07] father did so do
[5:16] you what what did David say for who is
[5:20] this uncircumcised belting that he
[5:22] should defile the armies of a living God
[5:25] so there there is a difference between
[5:27] the the Holy Ghost fill people and the
[5:30] ones that on that's
[5:32] right he said any child that refuses
[5:36] circumcision in the Old Testament which
[5:38] was the foreshadow of the Holy Ghost was
[5:41] cut off from among the people he could
[5:43] not have fellowship with the rest of the
[5:46] congregation if he refused to be
[5:55] circumcised is said now that P that
[5:57] today a person that will refuse to
[5:59] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:02] can have no Fellowship among those that
[6:05] have the Holy Ghost who just can't do it
[6:07] you have to be in
[6:10] nature you have to be
[6:12] what says
[6:17] nature and that's the way it is with a
[6:20] world and with a Christian when you have
[6:22] been circumcised by the Holy Ghost which
[6:24] is means to be cut off the flesh says
[6:28] circumcision synchron be made in a male
[6:30] but if a woman was married to a man she
[6:32] was part of him she was circumcised with
[6:35] him you remember intimity where said in
[6:38] there not withstanding she shall be
[6:41] saved and shall be if she continues in
[6:43] the faith and Holiness with
[6:48] alls about that all the
[6:58] time
[7:04] he said now you say brother BR that a
[7:07] sign of circumcision was given to
[7:09] Abraham he said that is true and to the
[7:14] seed he said how do we take on Abraham's
[7:17] seed by being in Christ then we are
[7:19] Abraham's
[7:26] seed he said now it's also besides the
[7:30] promise and a sign is also a seal now if
[7:33] you go with me into let's go to
[7:36] Ephesians
[7:43] 430 it says and grieve not the holy
[7:46] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[7:49] until the day of your
[7:55] Redemption he said that's what the holy
[7:57] spirit is it's the Seal of God and that
[7:59] he's
[8:00] found found you found Grace in his sight
[8:03] and he loves you and he believes you and
[8:05] he's put his seal upon you what is a
[8:08] seal anyone for a seal destinat or means
[8:12] that finish work
[8:16] amen God has saved you sanctify you
[8:19] clean you up found favor with you and
[8:21] seal you he's finished your this product
[8:24] until the day of your Redemption the
[8:27] seal is a finished thing
[8:30] and he talks about the railroad uh car
[8:33] that uh they had to load them up and
[8:36] pack them up think shakes that
[8:39] the the inspector doesn't put a seal on
[8:42] it he said uh that's what the matter we
[8:47] don't get sealed so much we're too loose
[8:49] about things said when the inspector
[8:51] goes through to inspect your life to see
[8:54] if you're not just a little loose about
[8:56] these things little loose about your
[8:58] prayer life little loose about that
[9:00] temper little loose about that tongue to
[9:03] talk about others you'll never see the
[9:05] car some dirty habits some V thing some
[9:08] vulgarity M you can't seal the car he
[9:12] said but when he found everything in his
[9:14] place the inspector then he sealed it he
[9:17] said there be anybody open that seal
[9:20] until that car has reached his
[9:21] destination to where sheld for there is
[9:26] there is touch not my anointing do
[9:29] profets no harm for I say unto you it be
[9:32] better for you that a mstone went L at
[9:35] your neck and you were drown in the dep
[9:37] of the sea and even to try to offend or
[9:41] shake a little on un least that is
[9:45] that's been sealed you see what it
[9:48] means so that's what the holy spirit is
[9:52] it's your Assurance it's your protection
[9:54] it's your witness it's your seal it's
[9:56] your sign that your heaven bound don't
[9:59] care what the devil says I'm having
[10:01] bound while he seal me he gave it to me
[10:04] he sealed me into his kingdom and I'm
[10:07] Glory
[10:08] bound we go to Beach Island to pick up
[10:12] uh it's Kimberly CLK uh pick up toilet
[10:17] paper paper towel diapers hand and uh we
[10:22] go in they tell you drop your Trail to a
[10:23] certain place and then go to the
[10:26] shipping office pick up your paperwork
[10:28] and you pick up a loaded trailer which
[10:30] is already sealed now when you go out of
[10:33] the gate they check your seal when you
[10:35] get to
[10:36] Madonna that seal better not be broken
[10:39] because right yep they'll refuse the
[10:42] whole thing sure will so that's right it
[10:44] has to be seal till he reach his
[10:54] destination in the message the Seal of
[10:58] antichrist but said
[11:00] uh what is the Seal of Satan was to
[11:04] reject the gospel and the Jubilee they
[11:06] were given a good news and they rejected
[11:10] it they are seal outside the kingdom to
[11:12] serve their Master the rest of their
[11:15] they were sealed by the ear for Faith
[11:17] cometh by hearing not physical he but
[11:20] spiritual hear who rejected for their
[11:22] last time and you're sealed
[11:27] out the at Christ 1955 said uh Jesus
[11:33] came to the Earth to bring a jubilee to
[11:35] the human race that through the
[11:38] preaching of the Gospel hearing by
[11:40] faith might set every slave to sin free
[11:57] right
[12:13] let's go to Hebrews 10 26 to
[12:27] 27
[12:57] Hebrews 10:26
[12:59] 27 for we sin willfully after that we
[13:02] have received the the knowledge of the
[13:05] truth there remain no more sacrifi for
[13:07] sin but a certain fearful looking for of
[13:11] judgment and FY indignation which shall
[13:16] Devol
[13:26] adversary I was going to say this but
[13:29] uh want to read the book of Acts it's uh
[13:32] questions and answers
[13:34] in 19 56 said
[13:39] did 1959 he said did anybody here ever
[13:43] see the C the M's 10 commandments did
[13:47] you notice when the Commandments was
[13:49] been written how he caught it I didn't
[13:51] know there was two or three things that
[13:54] I've seen in that that I really like the
[13:56] first thing is that ameral light
[13:59] that's exactly what it looked like see
[14:02] another thing was when the Commandments
[14:04] was written after it was over did you
[14:06] notice flying away from that that big
[14:09] pill of fire there was little licks of
[14:11] fire flying away did you notice that did
[14:13] you notice
[14:16] that what I what what I think this
[14:20] was a
[14:22] Pentecost there appeared unto them so
[14:24] they could see it it didn't say there
[14:26] fell on them but there appear D licks we
[14:30] call it tongues like tongue like this
[14:34] tongue shape of the tongue lick apart
[14:38] now ear as I said ear ear is ear finger
[14:41] is finger finger don't mean you felt it
[14:44] it means it look like a finger if it was
[14:52] a if it was their ear didn't mean they
[14:55] heard it it looked like an ear this was
[14:58] far that look like a tongue
[15:04] mhm not someone speaking a fire that
[15:07] look like a
[15:10] tongue like
[15:21] that let's go to Galatians uh chapter
[15:27] 3
[15:43] so got to mix it up a little bit
[15:44] remember what I said the old B of the
[15:46] Holy Ghost that's
[15:57] right Galatians
[16:00] 3 verse
[16:03] 16 now to Abraham and to his Seed where
[16:07] that promise made he said not to seed as
[16:10] of many but as of one and to they seed
