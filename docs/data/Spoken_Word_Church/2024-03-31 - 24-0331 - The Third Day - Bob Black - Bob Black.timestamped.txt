[0:00] amen God bless you
[0:02] Saints and happy Resurrection
[0:08] Day and that's what I I we we'll do a
[0:11] little out of band uh Sunday school
[0:12] lesson today and I want to talk about
[0:14] the
[0:15] resurrection you think about um that
[0:19] everything everything we're doing and
[0:21] everything we're standing for and uh our
[0:24] whole life is based on what what
[0:25] happened uh on that on that Resurrection
[0:28] morning when Jesus came forth from the
[0:30] the grave to prove to prove that he
[0:32] could if he could do it for one he could
[0:33] do it for all of
[0:35] us so let's let's just go the Lord in
[0:38] prayer before we read this little
[0:39] scripture in in Mark chapter 8 Lord God
[0:41] we we're so grateful Lord for all that
[0:43] you've done for us Lord and for the
[0:44] privilege to be able to gather around
[0:46] your word today I pray God that you'll
[0:47] just be with us today as we study these
[0:49] things out and just kind of go through
[0:50] these scriptures be with brother Tim
[0:53] Lord as he's preparing Lord Jesus
[0:54] prepare our hearts Lord God to receive
[0:56] what you have in store for us Lord we
[0:58] just ask your blessing upon the service
[0:59] now your
[1:01] name so Mark 8 uh: 31 says and he began
[1:06] to teach them that the son of man must
[1:08] suffer many things and be rejected of
[1:09] the elders and of the chief priests and
[1:11] scribes and be killed and after three
[1:13] days rise again and he spake that saying
[1:16] openly and Peter took him and began to
[1:18] rebuke him but when he had turned about
[1:20] and looked on his disciples he rebuked
[1:22] Peter saying get thee behind me Satan
[1:24] for thou savest not the things that be
[1:26] of God but the things that be of men are
[1:29] you think about
[1:30] Peter didn't quite understand what
[1:33] Jesus's purpose was and uh he he he was
[1:37] stumbling at that
[1:38] and you know really if we want to
[1:41] understand the will and purpose of our
[1:43] life and the purpose of all these things
[1:44] if you get into the into the word like
[1:46] brother Tim was saying yesterday that
[1:48] his word is his will and his word is
[1:50] like a road road map for our life and
[1:53] and uh the road map for Jesus's life was
[1:56] he was going to have to die to die for
[1:58] us to die for our sins and go to that
[2:00] cross and go through all the things that
[2:03] that were represented in that Journey
[2:05] but I I I want to kind of focus this
[2:07] morning on looking at the third day
[2:08] because there's there's so many thing
[2:10] that the third day is is uh so many
[2:14] types in the Old Testament that were
[2:15] pointing to that third day so many
[2:17] things that we can even look at today
[2:20] through the life of brother brandom and
[2:21] the Miracles that happened in his life
[2:22] and things that that were reflections of
[2:25] that third day and so many so many
[2:26] miracles that brother Brown talked about
[2:28] that that happened on that third day
[2:30] because there's there's something
[2:32] something tied in with that the third
[2:33] day is is is perfection and completeness
[2:36] and and life and that number three
[2:39] reflected all through scripture you
[2:41] think about what happened on the third
[2:42] day that 1 2 three Jesus died on that on
[2:45] that Friday afternoon he was in the
[2:46] grave and then he come up on
[2:48] Resurrection morning and the scripture
[2:50] says in Matthew chapter 16 from that
[2:53] time forth began Jesus to show unto his
[2:55] disciples how that he must go into
[2:57] Jerusalem and suffer many things of the
[2:59] elders and chief priests and scribes and
[3:01] be killed and be raised again the third
[3:03] day and Matthew chapter 17 says they
[3:05] shall kill him in the third day so many
[3:08] scriptures maybe we won't go through
[3:09] each one of these in detail but um the
[3:11] third day he shall rise again in Luke
[3:13] chapter 9 he be raised the third day and
[3:16] over again it talks about the third day
[3:19] the third what was that third day is the
[3:20] ultimate fulfillment of Divine Purpose
[3:24] the demonstration of God's power over
[3:27] death that on that third day you could
[3:30] see and like brother brother Tim was
[3:32] saying how do how do we know that that
[3:34] happened how do we know there's there's
[3:36] uh many historians that you can look at
[3:39] Josephus and tacitus and all those that
[3:41] wrote about the life of Jesus but those
[3:44] are these like like Peter said uh he
[3:46] said you know I was up there on the
[3:48] mount
[3:49] Transfiguration when I when I I I saw
[3:52] you know I heard the voice from Heaven
[3:54] speaking to to say hear ye him to Jesus
[3:57] but I've got a more sure word of
[3:58] Prophecy the days star that shines in
[4:00] our heart that you actually sitting here
[4:03] today with the pillar of fire in your
[4:04] heart that same Pillar of Fire are the
[4:06] testimony that these things are true you
[4:08] are the Vindication that these things
[4:09] are true and we a testimony that the
[4:12] same power that rose up Christ from the
[4:14] grave could change your life and change
[4:16] your thoughts and change your change
[4:18] your being so that you could be a
[4:19] witness you are a witness that these
[4:22] things are true amen the third day now
[4:25] three is the number of life and these
[4:27] are quotes that brother R said three is
[4:29] the number of life life and God chose
[4:31] three he said in another place and three
[4:32] is God's number of perfection and he
[4:35] said in another place when the little
[4:36] baby Christ was born three stars went
[4:39] together and made the one morning star
[4:41] that reflected the coming of an infant
[4:44] Christ a perfect one three showing what
[4:47] it was a testifying three show
[4:49] testifying that life was coming that
[4:51] life was coming to the world to die for
[4:54] us that you you and I could have that
[4:55] same life you you think when when when
[4:58] God uh when he created the world and
[5:00] began to take the the chaos of the world
[5:03] and and put order to it and begin to uh
[5:06] on that third day when he he spoke and
[5:08] life began to spring up grass and trees
[5:11] and all those things that he he so uh on
[5:15] that third day it was meant so much to
[5:17] God that He gave it a double blessing as
[5:19] we'll read in Genesis 1: 10 he said and
[5:22] God saw that it was good and God said
[5:25] let the Earth bring forth grass the herb
[5:27] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[5:28] yielding forth fruit after his kind and
[5:30] the Earth brought forth grass and Herb
[5:32] yelding seed and and again he said and
[5:34] God saw that it was good so that on the
[5:36] third day there was a double blessing
[5:39] giving now you you we're just kind of
[5:42] run through all these Third Day Third
[5:44] Day types in the
[5:46] Bible a Jewish wedding is is is usually
[5:49] held on the third day many Jewish
[5:52] couples choose to have their wedding on
[5:53] a Tuesday which is considered a favor
[5:56] favorable day for weddings in Jewish
[5:57] tradition in this case the wedding would
[6:00] take place on the third day of the week
[6:02] counting from Sunday so Sunday Monday
[6:05] not not all Jewish weddings are on
[6:06] Tuesday but most a lot of the time they
[6:08] want to have it on Tuesday and even
[6:11] there in John Chapter 2 it says the
[6:12] third day there was a marriage in Cana
[6:14] of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was
[6:16] there now you think about you think
[6:18] about how the third day today's the
[6:20] third day from Friday that the The Good
[6:23] Friday when when Christ went into the
[6:24] ground but any day really could be your
[6:26] third day maybe maybe you you been
[6:29] Justified and you've been Sanctified and
[6:31] then you come to a place where you
[6:33] really really ready to open up your
[6:35] heart and you the words been packed in
[6:36] and you've been holding the word and
[6:38] this today could be your third day uh
[6:41] any day could be like Tuesday might be
[6:43] the third day of the Jewish wedding
[6:45] maybe maybe you go home and you begin to
[6:48] really meditate on the word of God and
[6:49] through the week and you're riding in
[6:51] your car and you're thinking about
[6:52] things and the word just been building
[6:54] up and and culminating until you just
[6:56] finally cut loose and the the the spirit
[6:58] of God comes in car or in your shower in
[7:00] the morning or by your bed at night and
[7:02] oh there you got your third day what
[7:04] what's the third day the third day is
[7:06] when life comes the third day is when
[7:08] God fulfills his promise to you and
[7:11] shows that he's got power over death
[7:13] hell and the grave and and delivers you
[7:15] from all the maybe all the Mind battles
[7:17] and things like that you think about uh
[7:20] when Abraham and Isaac were walking up
[7:22] that mountain it was on the third day
[7:24] when Abraham looked and he saw he saw
[7:26] the place where he was going to take
[7:28] have to take his son to be sacrificed
[7:30] and it was the third day when Isaac
[7:33] spoke to his father and said My Father
[7:34] Here I am I but where where is the Lamb
[7:37] for a burnt offering and Abraham was he
[7:39] was going to he was going to kill his
[7:41] only son but God had a sacrifice
[7:45] prepared now that see how that all types
[7:48] back to Christ that we needed a
[7:50] sacrifice we needed a lamb and God he
[7:52] steal Jehovah Gyra he provided he
[7:54] provided us a lamb on the cross on the
[7:56] third day that he rose from the grave he
[7:59] was the lamb that God provided now you
[8:01] remember remember this was the same
[8:03] thing that had Wright was saying that
[8:05] ain't nothing the truth to because
[8:06] brother R was telling that story of he's
[8:07] still the same Jehovah Gyra today taking
[8:10] that back he's still the same Jehovah
[8:12] Gyra he's still the same Jehovah Gyra
[8:14] that can that that will that will
[8:16] provide provide every promise that he's
[8:19] given to us amen it was the third day
[8:21] when they were coming up to the River
[8:23] Jordan and and God told Joshua he said
[8:25] pass through the host and command the
[8:26] people prepare you victuals for within 3
[8:29] days shall pass over this Jordan to go
[8:31] in to possess the land which the Lord
[8:33] your God giveth you to possess it and in
[8:35] Joshua 3:2 it say and it came to pass
[8:38] after three days that the officers went
[8:40] through the host so it was the third day
[8:42] when they were following the word Over
[8:44] the River Jordan and the water parted
[8:46] and they went over over the over the
[8:48] water it was the third day when Esther
[8:51] came before The King and it came to pass
[8:53] in Esther chapter 5 it says and it came
[8:55] to pass on the third day after Esther
[8:58] had been fasting and praying and she got
[9:00] all of her maids and everybody to to
[9:02] fast and pray with her and fast and
[9:04] prayed but on the third day she stood
[9:06] before the king that Esther put on her
[9:08] royal apparel and stood in the inner
[9:10] Court of the King's house over against
[9:12] the King's house and the King sat upon
[9:14] his Royal throne in the Royal house over
[9:16] against the Gate of the house and what
[9:18] are all these things thinking of they're
[9:20] all types of the third day when Christ
[9:23] Rose from the grave the third day to
[9:26] give you a third day that you'll come
[9:28] through justification sanctification the
[9:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the full
[9:32] word where God can can raise you from
[9:35] your from out of dead domination and out
[9:38] of your old carnal ideas and raise you
[9:40] up into Victory through the power of the
[9:42] same power that raised him up from the
[9:44] grave it was three days after they had
[9:47] been wandered in the wilderness without
[9:49] without water in Exodus chapter 15 it
[9:52] says they went three days in the
[9:54] wilderness and God brought them to the
[9:56] bitter Waters and they how they were one
[9:59] how are we going to drink from this and
[10:01] Moses cried un the Lord and God showed
[10:03] him a tree throw that tree into the
[10:05] water and he took on the third day the
[10:08] bitter Waters became pure so they could
[10:10] drink it and it was three days that
[10:13] Jonah was in the belly of the Well I
[10:15] this might not be a you know it's it's a
[10:17] strange picture here but you you think
[10:19] about what a horrible thing that would
[10:21] have been for Jonah to be swallowed up
[10:23] in a whale and brother Ram said that God
[10:25] gave him oxygen he gave him oxygen in
[10:27] that belly of the whale to keep him
[10:28] alive down in that belly of well a typee
[10:31] something that Jesus could refer back to
[10:34] and say that as Jonah was in the belly
[10:36] of the well for 3 days so must the son
[10:38] of man be in the heart of the earth
[10:40] three days and it was on the third day
[10:43] when the word the children of Israel
[10:45] gathered around Mount Si and and and
[10:48] Moses was going to go up and bring the
[10:49] Tabernacles the the the the stones uh
[10:52] the The Ten Commandments down to them
[10:55] and God was going to align everything so
[10:57] that they could have the the word
[10:59] in Exodus chapter Exodus 19 it says be
[11:02] ready against the third day for the
[11:04] third day the Lord will come down in the
[11:05] sight of all the people upon Mount SII
[11:09] and it came to pass on the third day in
[11:11] the morning that there were Thunders and
[11:12] Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the
[11:14] mount and it was the third day it was a
[11:17] third day when when uh David was going
[11:22] to be was going to ascend to be king
[11:25] because it said in 2 Samuel chapter 2 it
[11:27] came to pass even on the third day that
[11:29] Behold a man came out of the camp from
[11:31] Saul with his clothes rent and Earth
[11:34] upon his head and so it was when he came
[11:36] to David that he fell to the Earth and
[11:39] did
[11:40] obes it was the third day when that
[11:42] amalaki ran out and you remember the
[11:44] whole story that that uh David found out
[11:46] that he had that amalaki had he said I'm
[11:48] an amalaki and I I saw that Saul was
[11:51] slain in battle so I took it upon myself
[11:54] to go ahead and finish the job and David
[11:57] got so upset with him he's like you
[11:58] don't touch
[12:59] two days and the third day he will
[13:01] revive us again and give us light in his
[13:04] sight life in his sight there is your
[13:07] trumpets coming in so if you want to
[13:09] kind of map that out 780 BC another
[13:13] thousand years will be 221 ad another
[13:17] thousand years will be 1221 ad and we're
[13:20] right here in that third day
[13:24] 28284 years when the prophecy of Hosea
[13:27] said in the third day he will raise us
[13:29] up what that same power that raised up
[13:32] Christ from the grave would come back to
[13:34] restore our faith back to the original
[13:36] faith of the Pentecostal fathers here
[13:39] right here in the third day now you know
[13:41] as brother Tim was preaching yesterday
[13:43] and and brother Solomon was laying out
[13:45] there was when Jesus rose from the grave
[13:47] the morning of the third day there was a
[13:49] rumor went out is he really risen and in
[13:53] Luke chapter 24 it says it was Mary
[13:54] Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother
[13:56] of James and other women that women that
[13:58] were with him which told these things
[14:00] unto the apostles and their words seemed
[14:02] to them as Idle tales and they believed
[14:05] them not they're going around telling
[14:07] everybody that I I I know that he's
[14:09] risen but they wouldn't believe him it
[14:11] was just a rumor that went out it was a
[14:14] third day rumor but brother said and
[14:16] Jesus had been crucified and dead buried
[14:18] a rumor had been he had raised again and
[14:21] he walked with them all day and they
[14:22] didn't know him he's talking about on
[14:24] the way to
[14:25] EMAs thinking about Jesus walking with
[14:28] the two dis disciples and they didn't
[14:30] know who he was he has walked with many
[14:32] people they didn't know it that's who
[14:33] kept him from having that wreck coming
[14:35] over here that's what heals your baby
[14:37] Christ and maybe you didn't recognize it
[14:41] but now on the evening of the third day
[14:44] the evening of the third day isn't that
[14:46] a wonderful type in the evening time it
[14:49] was a it's it in Luke chap 24 verse 39
[14:54] but they constrained him saying abide
[14:55] with us for it is toward evening and the
[14:58] day is far spent and he went into to ter
[15:01] with them and it came to pass as he sat
[15:02] at meat with them he took bread and
[15:04] blessed it and break and gave to them
[15:07] and their eyes were open and they knew
[15:08] him and he vanished out of their sight
[15:11] and they said one to another did not our
[15:13] heart burn within us while he talked
[15:15] with us by the way and while he opened
[15:17] to us the scriptures and Luke chapter 24
[15:19] keep reading on and they rose up the
[15:21] same hour and returned to Jerusalem and
[15:23] found the 11 gathered together and them
[15:25] that were with him saying the Lord is
[15:27] risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon
[15:30] and they told what things were done in
[15:32] the way and how he was known of them in
[15:35] Breaking of bread and as they thus spake
[15:39] Jesus himself to stood in the midst of
[15:41] them and saith unto them peace be unto
[15:45] you so it was in the evening time when
[15:47] they began to recognize that Christ had
[15:49] really risen now we've heard a message
[15:51] in this day to bring to our to our
[15:54] understanding that Christ is indeed
[15:55] risen you you know if you follow all
[15:57] these miraculous things that happened in
[15:59] brother R brother brother Ram's life
[16:01] you'll find Miracle after miracle that
[16:02] happened on the third day even even that
[16:05] picture that they took that the critics
[16:07] took the picture of the pillar fire
[16:08] there in Houston Coliseum they actually
[16:11] they meditated on George Lacy brother R
[16:13] said they they went and they meditated
[16:15] on it for a couple of days but it was on
[16:18] the third day when they came forth and
[16:20] they said they made that the the the
[16:23] statement brethen brandom one of these
[16:25] days you're going to pass off of life
[16:26] scen like all Mortals do he said I I'm
[16:29] aware of that sir but as long as there's
[16:32] a Christian civilization your picture
[16:34] shall never die and that
[16:37] picture he said you'll know about it on
[16:39] at 2:00 on the following afternoon on
[16:41] the third day it was the third day
[16:44] brother R when he was telling all these
[16:47] experiences he said there was a little
[16:48] girl laying kind of stooped over he said
[16:51] I laid my hands on her now father to the
[16:54] father do you and mother promise to
[16:56] serve God testify wherever you go about
[16:58] it we will I said' don't fear I have a
[17:01] word for you and and he goes on he said
[17:04] I walked out of the building and on the
[17:05] third day the child returned to school
[17:08] it was healed well so many miracles and
[17:12] things that were comparing to this third
[17:14] day there's another example of um this
[17:18] uh this little boy that had pneumonia
[17:20] and his brother had already died of
[17:22] pneumonia and brother brandham prayed
[17:24] for he God showed him a vision and he he
[17:27] prayed for the the the little child and
[17:29] um and you know if you go back and look
[17:32] at the story uh he was he was supposed
[17:34] to wait for the mama to be in the room
[17:37] but he went ahead and prayed and and he
[17:39] and and nothing happened and he realized
[17:41] well it's not according to the vision
[17:43] and so nothing happened and he he waited
[17:46] and he stayed and he kept praying until
[17:48] finally God told him uh what to do next
[17:51] and he he called the Dad over and he
[17:53] said do you still have confidence in me
[17:55] and and he prayed for him and he and and
[17:57] he began to get well
[17:59] and and brother brand relays the story
[18:01] he said now in three days three days
[18:04] he's going to come he's going to walk
[18:05] across the floor to me and he's going to
[18:07] put his little hands in mine and say
[18:09] brother brandom I'm perfectly whole and
[18:11] the whole church he told the whole
[18:12] church and they had such confidence in
[18:14] that they they all parked their cars
[18:16] outside of the house and they they got
[18:18] they were ready to go into the house and
[18:21] see God's word be fulfilled on that
[18:23] third day on the third day the whole
[18:25] church was there to see that little boy
[18:27] walk across the floor and say brother
[18:29] brandom I'm perfectly whole on the third
[18:32] day and what are all these things
[18:33] speaking of Christ Rose from the grave
[18:35] on the third
[18:37] day and the testimony brother BR said
[18:40] about 3 months after that he's telling
[18:42] another testimony he said I happen to
[18:43] see somebody back there waving and I
[18:45] didn't know who it was sitting right out
[18:47] like that and they was waving at me and
[18:49] it was the woman sitting there she said
