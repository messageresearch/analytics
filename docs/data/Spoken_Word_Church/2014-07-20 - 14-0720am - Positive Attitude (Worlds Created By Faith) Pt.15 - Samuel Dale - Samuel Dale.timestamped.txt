[5:52] house of the Lord if you like turning
[5:54] your scriptures we'll turn to Hebrews
[5:57] 11 and then we'll go go to Genesis
[6:01] 1 Hebrews 11 Genesis 1 now we know that
[6:06] there's many sick among us and things we
[6:09] pray the Lord would bless and is brother
[6:12] Boyd doing

[6:52] would bless him and take care of it and
[6:55] any other announcements I only miss
[6:57] one somewhere but all
[7:02] right Hebrews 11 and then Genesis 1 Lord
[7:06] Jesus we thank you thank you for
[7:09] everything father that you've given unto
[7:11] us and you said you give it to us freely
[7:14] so we didn't have to do anything to get
[7:16] it we just sit back and relax and thank
[7:19] you for everything we ask you that you
[7:22] would just guide each and every one of
[7:23] us in understanding of you
[7:26] Lord that you'd open our eyes to Thy
[7:29] Word word and that Lord we may be able
[7:31] to see you we pray that you'd touch the

[7:38] us we touch brother Boyd there Lord
[7:40] deliver him Brother Gary Lord the
[7:43] different ones that are sick among us
[7:45] God we know there's a lot of sicknesses
[7:46] here we pray that the Lord would that
[7:49] you Lord would have the preeminence in
[7:52] taking away all the things because we
[7:54] know Satan can't do it but we know you
[7:57] have already done it all we got to do is
[8:00] believe you as we read your word you
[8:02] come and speak to us Lord guide us now
[8:04] and forgive our sins lead us in thine
[8:07] understanding bless each one Lord in
[8:10] Jesus name
[8:13] amen Hebrews
[8:19] 11 now Faith is the substance of things
[8:22] hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[8:26] for by it the elders obtained a good
[8:28] report
[8:30] through faith we understand that the
[8:31] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[8:35] that things which were which are seen
[8:38] were not thing made of things which
[8:41] appear all right do appear all right now
[8:44] let's notice now it says we understand
[8:47] that the worlds were
[8:50] framed by the word of God all right now
[8:54] let's go to Genesis
[8:57] 1 and and it says in the beginning God
[9:01] created the Heaven and the Earth and the
[9:04] Earth was without form and void and
[9:06] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[9:08] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[9:10] face of the waters you may be seated the
[9:14] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[9:16] the word
[9:20] now I skipped
[9:23] over the uh second verse of Hebrews
[9:28] deliberately
[9:29] because uh you know it says there that
[9:33] uh that we understand the elders to
[9:34] obtain a good
[9:36] report so we will go to that you know
[9:39] when we start getting into each one of
[9:41] the of the uh ones it says by faith Abel
[9:45] by faith Enoch by faith all right we
[9:48] will try to get back onto that part but
[9:51] I want you to think about today the
[9:54] thing I want you to think about is what
[9:56] we've been
[9:57] studying that faith is the
[10:02] substance of what things consist
[10:05] of all right so then God it says
[10:12] created the Heaven and the Earth you'll
[10:16] notice in that form it's in a singular
[10:20] heaven and a singular Earth all right
[10:24] and then we get over into Hebrews 11 and
[10:29] it says the
[10:31] worlds were
[10:33] fined one of them dealing with a
[10:36] singular the other one seemingly dealing
[10:39] with more than one all right I won't try
[10:42] to cover too much on it but a little bit
[10:46] to where that we can make sure that we
[10:48] understand because I asked a question
[10:51] there Wednesday night about Genesis uh
[10:55] you know in the account and things that
[10:59] to make it to where we can stay with the
[11:01] word of God that it says in the
[11:04] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[11:07] Earth all right and then there's just a
[11:10] big old period there mean stop you know
[11:13] think about these things consider it all
[11:16] right then science comes along and they
[11:18] say well the world is billions of years
[11:21] old well we agree with it we have no
[11:24] argument about the uh doings and the
[11:28] things because that's what it says and
[11:31] it says and the world was without form
[11:32] and void and the spirit of God moved
[11:35] upon the the earth and the waters and
[11:38] the different things you know and uh see
[11:41] then that wouldn't matter because that
[11:43] would make it to where science could
[11:45] come up and with their carbon contents
[11:48] they call it um try to prove a lot of
[11:52] things they just go too far with their
[11:55] proving because like I said they take a
[11:57] bone that Wednesday that uh is laying on
[12:01] the ground and they take the bone the
[12:05] carbon content of the world is billions
[12:07] of years
[12:08] old no
[12:10] problem because it said God created
[12:13] heaven heaven and the Earth so there's
[12:15] no problem with the carbon content of
[12:17] the
[12:18] world being billions of years
[12:22] old see because you know God just
[12:25] created it went through they know that
[12:28] there was forms called ice ages uh there
[12:31] was all kind of things that they can
[12:33] prove
[12:34] scientifically that did take place and
[12:37] and we believe that all right but then I
[12:43] asked the question upon what day was the
[12:45] world the Heaven and the earth created
[12:48] and and we spoke just a second on that
[12:50] and and I'm not going to spend a lot on
[12:53] it but just say it this way that see the
[12:56] world and things was not created on the
[12:58] the first
[13:01] day it just simply says the Heaven and
[13:04] the Heaven and the Earth was
[13:07] created then day one starts with verse
[13:10] three when you start talking about light
[13:14] l i
[13:16] GT all right in that then you're you're
[13:20] breaking it down then to to the creation
[13:23] and the six days of the creation you
[13:26] know and each item or what whatever
[13:29] coming on the the times and it brings
[13:32] there that it says
[13:34] light all right then you get about to
[13:37] the fourth day or somewhere third or
[13:39] fourth day and and you start talking
[13:41] about the Sun and the Moon all right see
[13:45] then it's not speaking of maybe that in
[13:49] the part or in the first day it's
[13:53] dividing the day I mean dividing the
[13:57] darkness and it's it's not that there
[13:59] wasn't any
[14:01] light you
[14:02] know but we'll say in this dimensional
[14:07] or situation
[14:08] existence uh light was not in this part
[14:13] all right then you know God moved it
[14:16] into a situation or turned on the light
[14:19] really scopio gives you a definition of
[14:22] it that that in Genesis 13 that is
[14:26] really not a creative act it is a uh
[14:30] more or less a
[14:31] revealing you know a coming into being
[14:35] or letting it be known because it
[14:37] stipulates see that that that Darkness
[14:40] was upon the face well now dark God
[14:43] didn't create
[14:46] Darkness
[14:48] right you say well God create no no God
[14:51] didn't create Darkness Darkness is an
[14:54] absence of
[14:55] light that's why you can be so dark in
[14:58] this room
[15:00] but yet the darkness of this room you
[15:02] could take the darkness of the world and
[15:05] put it in this room but strike one match
[15:07] see the light shines because
[15:13] darkness is not a creative
[15:16] act Darkness was an absence of light so
[15:20] then uh my way of seeing it is this
[15:24] way that God was going to use you know
[15:28] and do and creative and as he did then
[15:32] in that Dimension our our uh remember we
[15:37] brought it out brought around and said
[15:38] this seed was laying there upon the
[15:40] Earth from some other
[15:43] civilization well a lot of people thinks
[15:45] then there was other
[15:46] civilizations created you know or
[15:48] something I I don't agree with
[15:51] that but I do believe that there were as
[15:54] we'll get to it in a minute there were
[15:55] many worlds created
[15:59] all right it's all going to come from
[16:02] one
[16:04] thing it's all going to come from one
[16:07] point that we do believe basically in
[16:10] not all they teach but we do believe in
[16:13] The Big Bang Theory that all at once you
[16:17] started this great something happened
[16:20] Bloom and then out goes the the uh
[16:23] Sparks from the Sun and the things you
[16:26] know that created all of the planets
[16:28] stars and you know and and stuff like
[16:31] that and and it took me you know 20
[16:34] years to learn there was a difference a
[16:35] planet and the star and all like that
[16:37] you know because it's just how dumb we
[16:40] are
[16:42] but the point of what I want to get
[16:45] at is just simply this and then maybe
[16:48] we'll get back to this uh
[16:50] eventually
[16:52] but the Bible is right when it says in
[16:56] the beginning God created the Heaven
[16:58] Heaven and the Earth and then it stopped
[17:01] right there all right so he created
[17:06] everything all
[17:08] right and then later on he begins to
[17:13] after Millions trillions or whatever
[17:16] years and I saying about the the carbon
[17:18] content of the bone it's impossible to
[17:21] brush off or they wouldn't try to brush
[17:23] off the Earth from the bone so naturally
[17:26] when they analyze the bone
[17:29] if they cut inside of it it would
[17:32] be so many thousand years old but by
[17:36] taking the carbon content of the outside
[17:38] of it it would be the same age as the
[17:41] Earth it was laying in that's no problem
[17:43] with
[17:44] me I've always tried to be
[17:48] sensible because I think that's the
[17:50] point to be that we don't deny science
[17:53] we don't deny those things but then when
[17:55] science says you know this is wrong or
[17:57] that is wrong we we go back to the
[18:00] Bible and see it could was without
[18:02] forming void for billions of years all
[18:05] right then God started using
[18:10] it and the first part was light came
[18:13] into being to take away the darkness
[18:16] then it's recorded that that is the
[18:18] first day so then the Earth was not
[18:21] created on the first
[18:23] day the heavens were not created on the
[18:26] first day and it says singular
[18:29] Heaven and
[18:30] Earth all right because that then would
[18:34] fall back to the
[18:36] point that uh it was possible that
[18:40] everything was in one
[18:43] shape one form then the
[18:48] atomic uh nuclear or whatever went off
[18:51] and and blow into what is called a Big
[18:53] Bang Theory and then you started moving
[18:56] out and doing this and doing that and
[18:58] then as a prophet describes it which is
[19:01] very simple then to me he just simply
[19:03] saw the Earth where we're at
[19:06] now he saw all these planets and
[19:09] everything and he put them in place to
[19:10] to be where that they would be uh moons
[19:13] with control Sun would do this but
[19:16] remember we we're not the only one in
[19:19] the solar system that has a
[19:21] sun we're not the only one in the solar
[19:24] system that has
[19:25] moons right see there is solar systems
[19:29] of solar systems you know out there
[19:33] there's other situations that would
[19:35] exist just like we
[19:38] exist all right in the point that it
[19:41] would have the moon the Suns and the
[19:44] things that would be into that all right
[19:47] we'll get back to that in a second but
[19:49] I'm not trying to be a scientific person
[19:52] I'm trying to make a
[19:54] point because the point is faith is the
[19:59] substance of things hope
[20:01] far the evidence of Things Not Seen so
[20:06] whatever it took to bring into
[20:09] being the Heaven and the
[20:15] Earth it would come
[20:18] from the word of
[20:21] God is that
[20:23] sensible it would be the word of God
[20:25] because he said let there
[20:27] be
[20:28] all right see then that would be the
[20:31] creative act of
[20:33] God speaking his word or it would be the
[20:37] spoken
[20:41] word would be the the the
[20:45] Creator all
[20:47] right now are you following the point
[20:49] see then that would put it all into one
[20:52] situation that God could just speak into
[20:57] being
[20:58] whatever would be so when he
[21:02] said let there be a heaven let there be
[21:05] an
[21:07] earth then it would be uh correct
[21:12] because he would be bringing it from a
[21:16] substance of
[21:18] Supernatural or the creative act of his
[21:21] own word as we'll read in a little bit
[21:23] when brother BR said God believed his
[21:26] own word I like that
[21:28] he he believed his own word you know all
[21:31] right I I think he still today believes
[21:34] his
[21:34] word all right and see then it would be
[21:38] a creative
[21:39] act but it would be done in such a way
[21:42] until scientific man could use his uh
[21:47] theories and ideas and come forth with
[21:52] uh sometimes a sensible
[21:56] answer but irregardless less of what
[21:59] evolution could come up with or anything
[22:02] could come up with to the poliwags to
[22:04] the frogs or what uh somewhere the
[22:06] polywog got started so that ends that
[22:09] problem you know whatever you want to
[22:12] say it was to start with if you want to
[22:14] call it energy because that's one of the
[22:16] main things they deal with that that
[22:18] energy and energy cannot be created and
[22:21] or destroyed it's only being controlled
[22:23] to a degree all right so you can call it
[22:26] energy but but still where did the
[22:28] energy come you
[22:31] know whatever it is it would have to go
[22:34] back to almighty God being the Creator
[22:37] why would be the
[22:40] problem you
[22:43] know that's why I say that there's no
[22:45] such things as
[22:47] atheists there's idiots but not
[22:51] atheists because see if you
[22:54] believe that there is no
[22:56] God
[22:59] yeah see this is I know I I get rough
[23:02] and tough but this is the way I talk
[23:04] then I don't have to back down if you
[23:06] think there is no God or never was a God
[23:08] or whatever then you got to believe
[23:10] yourself to be
[23:14] superior you think your concept or your
[23:17] thought is the superiority so you're
[23:19] making yourself a God why don't you
[23:20] solve it that
[23:23] way and say as far as I'm
[23:26] concerned
[23:28] and then you can say I'm
[23:30] God no brother Dale I wouldn't do
[23:33] nothing like that that's what you're
[23:34] doing you're just dumb enough that you
[23:36] can't see
[23:39] it see then it brings it all back to God
[23:42] being the
[23:45] Creator we bring it back to him speaking
[23:48] the
[23:51] word and whatever would be
[23:54] needed could be brought into being
[24:01] right see it doesn't go over to day
[24:03] three day four day five or something and
[24:06] speak of a thing like we look at it it
[24:09] goes over into there like he created
[24:12] trees he created this he created that he
[24:16] created animals you know what we are
[24:21] dirt all right so we was in the
[24:24] original all the trees was in the
[24:27] original
[24:28] come on do we believe it every Apple it
[24:30] ever be on the trees and the seed when
[24:32] it goes in the ground so every tree in
[24:34] the garden a creative act brought a
[24:41] tree from an existence of what we as
[24:45] human beings cannot
[24:49] comprehend so why not just call it
[24:54] faith I mean to me that's what Paul was
[24:57] doing
[25:00] he didn't just start out talking with
[25:01] people about
[25:07] faith a't it
[25:09] odd I sitting there yesterday
[25:11] considering and I thought Lord now come
[25:14] on this thing is
[25:17] great and I was thinking why didn't they
[25:19] say by faith able say that
[25:25] first no cuz Abel's well over in the
[25:32] story you got to get the world here you
[25:36] got to get everything here and then you
[25:38] got to bring Abel out of the world and
[25:41] let him come into being then you talk
[25:43] about
[25:44] Abel by
[25:48] faith you know that Abel's Revelation
[25:51] provided a
[25:54] lamb all
[25:56] right there's a lot of things in the
[25:58] Bible that you're going to have to go
[26:00] from natural to a Supernatural
[26:03] part and that's why I gave the
[26:05] definition as I believe it to be that
[26:08] faith is the substance of things hope
[26:10] for all right we know that's in the
[26:12] Bible but whether it be
[26:15] natural or whether it be
[26:21] spiritual now when you get over into the
[26:24] creation and the
[26:26] dividing then remember the heaven was
[26:33] created no brother
[26:38] Dale how would you create
[26:43] heaven we see we're defining that as
[26:45] what we
[26:46] think we're not defining that as God the
[26:49] great Supernatural Above All The Heavens
[26:52] because heaven just refers to the
[26:56] atmospheric condition around
[27:01] you right am I right go home read it
[27:04] Webster tell
[27:05] you the Bible says you divide the waters
[27:09] that was above and the waters
[27:13] below and you know that could shoot all
[27:15] the way to the moon and couldn't find no
[27:18] water and argued with Noah about the
[27:21] water but the Bible had already said the
[27:23] water was
[27:26] there but it was there in an existence
[27:30] that would not be recorded by
[27:36] mankind I'm not a scientist I'm just
[27:39] trying to express something to
[27:43] you that faith is the substance of
[27:47] whatever you desire if you desire your
[27:50] healing then the word of God has to have
[27:54] that healing within
[27:56] it
[27:59] right so what we need is a
[28:01] revelation not of what day this is and
[28:04] what day that is and who done this what
[28:06] what day this come into being that's
[28:07] where you can spend all your
[28:10] life and become an educated
[28:14] idiot right instead of just simply
[28:17] sitting down and saying well the Lord
[28:19] took care of this it come into being now
[28:21] let me see what about
[28:26] me
[28:29] but are you following
[28:31] me
[28:33] so whatever comes into
[28:38] being whether it be the heaven or
[28:41] whether it be
[28:43] Earth remember it comes into being by a
[28:47] creative
[28:52] act because it says that in
[28:55] Genesis now Paul Paul is just a tiny bit
[28:58] distinct little bit difference but I'll
[29:01] be glad to give you the definition of
[29:02] the word but Paul is really more into
[29:06] to
[29:11] FR Paul uses
[29:14] framed whereas Genesis
[29:17] uses
[29:21] created there's a tiny bit of difference
[29:24] in the definition but not enough to be
[29:25] able to deal with but we'll get to that
[29:27] point that you it will open up to our
[29:31] understanding to where that we can see
[29:33] it all right so now watch my
[29:37] point whatever comes into
[29:40] being are you with me no matter what it
[29:44] is if it's anything we have any
[29:47] comprehension
[29:50] of understanding of or looking at will
[29:53] it be
[29:55] Heaven what do you mean Heaven would was
[29:57] created it was just there well that
[29:59] ain't what the Bible
[30:01] say so you can be an idiot idiot if you
[30:04] want
[30:05] to that's just part of that
[30:09] tree right in the
[30:13] garden cuz remember the Bible will
[30:16] Define
[30:20] heaven as being a firmament that's
[30:25] above all right but Remember by the New
[30:30] Birth the Bible says we are
[30:33] resurrected sitting in
[30:37] what Heavenly places in Christ
[30:43] Jesus well I I kind of think we're
[30:46] sitting here today don't you I don't
[30:48] think we're floating in space you
[30:51] know and I never did believe the people
[30:53] on the other side was hanging upside
[30:56] down and and that's why they had the
[30:57] slanted eyes I never did believe that
[31:01] one but think about
[31:06] it the worlds were
[31:11] created by the word of
[31:15] God when God said let thy
[31:19] be the from his
[31:23] Supernatural uh existence or whatever
[31:26] want to call it you see I I believe now
[31:29] I'm just honest so I'll tell you this we
[31:31] talk about where did God come
[31:33] from well the Bible said he come from
[31:36] teeman but you have to fuss about that
[31:40] all
[31:42] right but you say well well you know I
[31:46] believe that coming this away it come
[31:49] more real no no
[31:51] no that's that to me is a very
[31:56] um
[31:57] odd statement to be able to make for it
[32:00] coming this way made it something I
[32:02] believe that before anything ever
[32:04] existed that God existed
[32:07] alone all right but did he exist alone
[32:11] as a floating flob because remember they
[32:13] wouldn't know
[32:15] haveen as we know
[32:19] of remember there was no Earth as we
[32:23] know
[32:25] of and remember if things came from a
[32:30] former
[32:33] civilization he didn't I don't run that
[32:35] into it was other worlds created we got
[32:38] no problem because the Bible says they
[32:41] was we'll get to
[32:45] that but you want to try to make it some
[32:48] other civilization of people or
[32:49] something
[32:51] no but there was another civilization
[32:54] before this
[32:55] civilization and God existed
[32:58] alone he was that
[33:01] Civilization then he created
[33:05] angels and they were in that
[33:07] Civilization with him is that
[33:12] true and they worshiped him and made him
[33:14] God come on is that
[33:18] true then there must have been a greater
[33:22] World there than this world
[33:25] is
[33:28] I've tried 40 years to get that point
[33:30] across and it just don't seem to deep
[33:33] down into people's
[33:37] minds cuz we want to think this is the
[33:40] real
[33:41] thing this can be blown to smithin and
[33:44] taken totally out of
[33:46] existence and turn back to the original
[33:49] gases that it come
[33:51] from so evidently there must have been
[33:54] gases back there somewhere for it to
[33:55] come from
[33:58] you understand what I'm getting at I
[34:01] believe God is
[34:03] real he's just not an imaginary thought
[34:06] or a
[34:09] myth he created all
[34:13] things and he created it by his
[34:17] word you remember Wednesday night we got
[34:19] into it we'll drop back down to that a
[34:21] little bit later on God's not through
[34:25] yet
[34:28] he's still
[34:30] creating remember he's creating his
[34:36] bride remember she's a new
[34:40] creation not the old one made
[34:44] over but a new
[34:47] one all right so what do you think about
[34:50] it so then the worlds were framed by
[34:55] faith
[35:01] Faith being the substance of things H
[35:05] for the world could come from that
[35:08] situation that God existed
[35:12] alone but yet he could have thoughts and
[35:15] he could
[35:18] create all
[35:21] right and then he he would create see he
[35:25] could say Let There Be
[35:28] and it would just come into being what
[35:30] would come into being what was in his
[35:38] mind what was in his very
[35:43] being what was a part of
[35:46] him that remember to him it was already
[35:52] there to us we talk about a beginning
[36:01] right but remember his
[36:04] thoughts never had a
[36:07] beginning that's Eternal
[36:10] God I don't believe there people but but
[36:13] brother Dale God is a spirit
[36:18] amen you're
[36:20] right you're right you got a scripture
[36:24] but what are you going to do about the
[36:25] rest of it where it speaks of the heart
[36:28] the hands the mind the things of
[36:33] God there the Bible speak of
[36:40] it see then why don't we settle down to
[36:43] what the Bible says instead of our own
[36:47] Theology and where our theology crosses
[36:50] the word of God we get rid of theology
[36:52] we need
[36:54] neology right we need a little praying
[36:57] about
[36:59] things that's what makes me
[37:01] so you know when I heard that Prophet
[37:04] that first time when he
[37:06] said he said my daughter said that
[37:10] they're telling them in school that the
[37:12] world is billions of years old but said
[37:15] Daddy I thought you know paraphrasing it
[37:17] I thought it maybe it was only 6,000
[37:20] years he said but honey science is
[37:24] right said because the B
[37:28] says in the beginning God created heaven
[37:31] and earth perod said it might have been
[37:33] billions of
[37:34] years before it was ever
[37:37] used you know what it makes
[37:43] sense you know how I am the Bible is the
[37:46] only thing that's
[37:49] sensible right it is the only thing
[37:52] that's sensible your ideas and my ideas
[37:55] are not sensible
[37:57] their concepts are thoughts of
[38:00] imagination and most of them are
[38:02] motivated by
[38:10] Satan are you
[38:14] thinking then when he
[38:18] says in the beginning God created heaven
[38:22] and the
[38:23] Earth he made that a singular form
[38:27] I believe
[38:29] because that would be what it would
[38:36] be that that would be before
[38:39] the Big Bang
[38:45] Theory and you could put everything into
[38:47] one
[38:48] point and then you could have the Big
[38:50] Bang Theory and then Here Comes
[38:55] worlds
[38:59] right now we're still in the
[39:04] Bible because we read in Hebrews
[39:08] that it said the worlds were
[39:12] framed plural
[39:15] worlds were
[39:20] framed how though by the word of
[39:25] God
[39:28] so then in his creative
[39:30] act he showed what he was going to
[39:34] do now I do not believe that when this
[39:38] thing winds up that you're going to have
[39:40] to destroy all of these universes and
[39:43] all of these
[39:44] things now maybe you do but I
[39:48] don't but I do
[39:51] believe whether your s speaks it or
[39:54] whatever it is I believe that this Earth
[39:57] where we're living today is the center
[40:00] of the
[40:02] universe now it doesn't mean that like
[40:05] you're thinking the center of the
[40:07] universe means everything is evolving
[40:09] around it that's not what I'm talking
[40:11] about because there are at they
[40:15] are places Beyond this like I said to
[40:18] start with that they have their own
[40:19] moons they have their own Stars they
[40:21] have their own things gathered into
[40:23] their own solar system and we're just
[40:27] one little minut
[40:31] spot but you see I'll get to that in the
[40:35] minute God chose
[40:39] this right
[40:42] here you know why I believe
[40:45] that because he came down
[40:48] here he didn't go to Mars
[40:52] Jupiter well he might have created other
[40:55] people and put put them on them other
[40:57] stars and all them planets out there and
[40:59] they'd be just like
[41:01] us but where's your
[41:03] Bible I've got the scriptures where's
[41:05] your
[41:11] Bible it says in Genesis Eve is the
[41:14] mother of all
[41:15] living so whatever is out there would
[41:17] have to come from
[41:19] her and why move it out
[41:24] there when not think about this is where
[41:28] Heaven and Earth is going to
[41:33] connect you don't have to destroy
[41:35] everything
[41:37] else wouldn't it be wonderful one of
[41:39] these days that you and I could just say
[41:41] well let's just take a
[41:42] stroll and where you going said well I
[41:45] heard it's about 10 million miles
[41:48] to some Planet let's just walk over
[41:54] there ain't going be in no
[41:58] hurry because everything will be
[42:03] Eternal and I thought we believed that
[42:06] heaven was going to come down to
[42:10] earth and what we talk about is a future
[42:15] home well is that too far out of line
[42:19] when that
[42:20] heaven God himself came to this
[42:25] earth who live in these bodies in the
[42:30] New
[42:32] Birth is that hard to
[42:37] comprehend well then you can see that
[42:39] we're going to be the this to me is
[42:41] where God chose
[42:44] it to me that's the reason it says the
[42:47] way that it
[42:51] does then it says in the beginning God
[42:53] created the Heaven and the Earth
[43:00] right if the Big Bang Theory is correct
[43:03] of what they saying then every planet
[43:06] come off of the sun somewhere as we talk
[43:09] about it a big ball of light gases and
[43:11] the things exploded and out went things
[43:14] you've heard the prophet talk about it
[43:16] he said he let the Earth just move out
[43:17] there he said he took it so far away he
[43:20] said he let it go through a nice age and
[43:23] he let it just cut all of these places
[43:25] and do all these things he said then he
[43:27] just brought it right back in just a
[43:29] little piece and you know
[43:31] what it started forming
[43:36] into trees and grass and things that he
[43:43] created what about a seventh grade
[43:47] education man being able to talk to
[43:48] scientists about the world if they would
[43:51] have just listened to
[43:53] him but they wouldn't do it
[43:57] they have their own
[43:59] theories all
[44:01] right but just remember if there's
[44:04] anything that is ever
[44:07] created it is a creative act of almighty
[44:12] God because Satan can't
[44:17] create he perverts he can't create all
[44:20] right so anything that's a creation has
[44:23] to come from a
[44:25] creator and that ought to show God as
[44:27] being
[44:28] real even to an
[44:31] atheist but are you
[44:33] listening well I thought this wasn't
[44:35] going to take but a
[44:39] minute but in Genesis 1 one it says
[44:43] Heaven singular Earth
[44:46] singular we're
[44:49] created which means they were brought
[44:53] into
[44:54] being you
[44:57] know
[44:59] from something that was
[45:03] nothing into
[45:05] being as to we call it something you
[45:09] know tangible
[45:13] materials and as it
[45:17] did God had a reason for
[45:20] it okay we went through the big
[45:23] bang no problem Heaven and Earth you
[45:25] know is one
[45:27] one and then have a Big Bang Theory and
[45:30] let it slatter all the planets and
[45:31] Scatter everything and it just comes out
[45:33] as I was just covering about the Earth
[45:36] and how he'd move it
[45:37] out all
[45:39] right and how he would do that and we
[45:43] read there in
[45:47] Genesis I mean excuse me in Hebrews 11
[45:53] three through faith
[45:59] we
[46:01] right is that the Bible through faith
[46:05] we
[46:10] understand
[46:12] right the
[46:15] world were
[46:18] framed by the word of
[46:22] God we
[46:24] understand so that things which are seen
[46:28] were not made of things which do
[46:33] appear so over in that other
[46:36] civilization you want to call it Heaven
[46:39] you want to call it the place of God
[46:42] whatever you want to call
[46:43] it you don't have to have dirt and trees
[46:46] and things as we look at
[46:52] it I'd say it be 10 times thousands
[46:55] times more
[46:57] beautiful and you wouldn't have to have
[46:59] big old
[47:00] skyscraper uh buildings and airplanes to
[47:04] fly and and the things and see the movie
[47:08] industry takes these things and they
[47:10] make movies but sometimes you don't they
[47:11] hit pretty
[47:12] good I mean there was a guy named
[47:16] Superman right and Superman come from
[47:21] Krypton
[47:22] right and Krypton was a super race above
[47:26] all of this but remember s uh Superman
[47:31] didn't create the
[47:33] Earth he came to Earth but it does show
[47:37] that in the human mind we think about
[47:40] the things that can be done but you know
[47:43] what they're doing today they're almost
[47:45] bringing the human back to a
[47:47] supernatural Superman
[47:53] existence I remember reading about an
[47:55] old Indian way back a long time ago run
[47:58] 15 mil a day getting away from the
[48:01] troops they couldn't capture him he run
[48:04] 15 m a day and he'd eat up with
[48:07] arthritis I guess he stopped along the
[48:10] way and smoked a lot of weed I don't
[48:13] know ain't none of my business it's just
[48:19] true but nothing today for these
[48:23] soldiers to run 15
[48:28] miles and do almost
[48:32] Supernatural
[48:34] things for the human
[48:36] bodies little brother sitting back there
[48:39] he got his head busted trying it but he
[48:41] can run up that wall over
[48:46] there I'm not going to ask him to do it
[48:49] but some of these days I'd like to watch
[48:52] him because he's trained a human body
[49:00] right karate has trained people until
[49:02] it's almost a supernatural thing with
[49:06] the human bodies that they can
[49:09] do because we're getting back closer to
[49:13] that original
[49:15] civilization
[49:17] right there was Giants in the land it
[49:21] talks about in the beginning and I'm not
[49:24] just talking about black white yellow
[49:25] green or brown I'm talking about now
[49:28] today what do you got you got the the
[49:31] tallest the shortest man on the
[49:33] basketball team now 7
[49:39] foot I mean unless he's exceptionally
[49:42] exceptionally good he's going to be 7
[49:44] foot
[49:46] tall we used to jump up to get the ball
[49:49] in they just laying it
[49:51] down it's getting back to the original
[49:58] where it says there were giants in the
[50:01] land all right but listen church now the
[50:04] point I want to get them know I'm just
[50:06] going to get this part prob have to back
[50:10] up so it says in the beginning that God
[50:13] created heaven and the Earth
[50:15] period right but then Paul
[50:20] says that by
[50:23] Faith by a
[50:27] Revelation right we
[50:31] understand that the world's
[50:33] plural were
[50:36] framed by the word of
[50:40] God now you're coming from The Big Bang
[50:42] Theory as one and heaven and all and
[50:45] just
[50:46] go and start planets and Moons and stars
[50:51] and Suns and all kind of
[50:54] things and science has always said this
[50:57] which I understood it from from school
[50:59] listening to them and you know CU I love
[51:03] to listen you learn a lot if you
[51:08] listen you go to school kids if you'll
[51:10] sit down there and listen you do better
[51:13] than you do trying to go home do your
[51:15] homework I'm not suggesting doing it
[51:17] away with the homework I'm suggesting
[51:19] you
[51:20] listen because it can be done all right
[51:23] but we find that through listening that
[51:26] a lot of things are
[51:30] correct you
[51:34] know and that there are many
[51:42] worlds so Paul when he was writing must
[51:45] have been
[51:47] correct when he said the
[51:50] worlds but he used the word
[51:54] framed instead of choosing to use the
[51:56] word create very little difference but
[51:58] you can look up the
[52:01] definition but he say it was framed by
[52:03] the word of
[52:05] God all right they asked brother randam
[52:08] a question go ahead and pull up number
[52:10] one brother or excuse me number
[52:15] two well let's read number one Hebrews
[52:20] 11 God who at Sun
[52:23] Times and in diver manner spake in times
[52:26] past unto the prophets or to the fathers
[52:28] by the prophets as in these last days
[52:31] spoken unto us by his son whom he has
[52:33] the pointed there of all things for whom
[52:36] also he he made the
[52:41] worlds worlds
[52:45] plural all right we'll read in a minute
[52:48] where there's not anything created that
[52:51] he didn't
[52:53] create he's specifically says
[52:57] worlds they asked brother Brown the
[52:59] question on questions and
[53:03] answers 1959 paragraph 161 is there more
[53:07] than one world yes there's worlds of
[53:13] Worlds Hebrews the first chapter in the
[53:15] second verse Hebrews the 11th chapter
[53:18] and the third verse there's worlds of
[53:22] Worlds God created the worlds w o r l DS
[53:31] worlds so there
[53:34] worlds
[53:36] so God is writing in Genesis of one Paul
[53:41] is bringing it down to see that it come
[53:43] from that one and went out and made
[53:49] worlds brother R speaks on bma's vision
[53:52] of this
[53:54] way
[53:56] he is the one who conquered Both
[53:58] Worlds of the
[54:01] seen and
[54:07] unseen right so there ain't no Superman
[54:10] up there that's stronger than he
[54:12] is you don't have to worry about nobody
[54:15] coming from Krypton to try to take
[54:20] over but it does say the world of seen
[54:23] he said and the Unseen
[54:26] which mean there nothing can come from
[54:28] anywhere to conquer this
[54:31] God because he's a creator of the seen
[54:34] and the
[54:40] Unseen what we see he created what we
[54:44] can't see is the supernatural worlds
[54:48] fourth Dimensions Etc set a TV up here
[54:51] and you see the
[54:54] pictures
[54:57] he's a master of all don't worry about
[55:02] it both worlds are seen and unseen he
[55:05] created
[55:07] worlds brother R said Hebrews 11 says
[55:11] that so then when the Big Bang Theory
[55:14] went off then you see it it scattered
[55:16] all of these planets it scattered all
[55:18] these
[55:22] things and as it did it made all of this
[55:26] atmosphere Heavens it's whatever we
[55:28] don't want to call them you
[55:31] know like brother Brandon was talking
[55:33] about standing looking at them two stars
[55:35] you know remember when he told a man he
[55:37] said according to science they're
[55:38] further apart than we are from here to
[55:45] there as I started to tell you they say
[55:47] that the the world is that it's just
[55:50] moving I believe
[55:54] that
[55:55] this whole universe and everything is
[55:57] still
[55:58] moving I believe that you know why
[56:03] because God's not through
[56:08] creating well he created a physical
[56:11] right he created a physical
[56:13] creation and we came out of that
[56:17] original Earth that
[56:20] original
[56:23] place that was all together as
[56:26] one and he moved the Earth
[56:28] out to its
[56:31] place now that's why I believe Paul is
[56:35] stipulating
[56:38] framed
[56:40] framed more than he's stipulating
[56:42] creative
[56:44] act he's making us
[56:47] framed another words out of all of the
[56:50] whole things that he
[56:53] created
[56:56] he chose this
[56:59] Earth to frame
[57:02] it he chose this
[57:05] Earth to make it
[57:09] inhabitable oh up in the space they got
[57:11] these things look like monkeys no no no
[57:15] there's too many monkeys here to worry
[57:16] about what's out
[57:18] there
[57:20] you right always talking about things
[57:24] you don't believe in extraterrestrial be
[57:26] no I don't I believe in inter
[57:29] terrestrial I believe in idiots that are
[57:32] trying to make you think that there are
[57:33] those things and I've like I've always
[57:36] said to you that they say well so and
[57:39] so's been picked up so and so's happened
[57:41] this has happened you don't believe
[57:42] those things I believe they've happened
[57:45] I believe that there are actually uh
[57:47] spaceships flying around
[57:50] us but I believe they're our
[57:53] own because if you you'll go back to
[57:55] about
[57:56] 1955 somewhere in there I'll be glad to
[57:58] find it for you brother Brown says
[58:01] Russia had Jed our planes well we know
[58:04] that because Hitler had jet our planes
[58:07] at the end of World War I they just
[58:10] couldn't know how to control them it was
[58:12] just too F he couldn't do anything with
[58:14] them but he already had Jed a planes
[58:17] right and Russia brother R said had Jedi
[58:20] planes and flying
[58:23] saucers this into your computer flying
[58:25] saucers and lock it princesses and then
[58:28] put Russia in you'll find
[58:32] it they say they got one out there you
[58:35] know that every president gets the
[58:37] opportunity to go see
[58:40] these aliens that are in this spaceship
[58:43] you
[58:45] know which like I've always said ain't
[58:47] it kind of
[58:48] funny that everybody that is picked up
[58:51] by these aliens that these aliens can
[58:54] can speak whatever language they
[58:57] are and all of them haven't been English
[59:00] some of them have been Russians and
[59:02] chineses and you know whatever ain't it
[59:05] odd they can speak that
[59:08] language yeah he learned it at
[59:13] Yale but brother Dale what have you run
[59:16] into one of them guys I'll say Hey Joe
[59:19] how you
[59:21] doing you say you wouldn't be afraid why
[59:24] be afraid of anything like that that's
[59:27] not something I'm trying to get it out
[59:29] of the kids' mind see what science
[59:33] says brother Bram says they're flying
[59:37] saucers do you want to quote he said one
[59:40] day they'll pick you
[59:44] up now is it going to be a flying saucer
[59:47] that picks us up is he got a bunch of
[59:50] them parked out there in outer space
[59:51] waiting and he's going to scoop down to
[59:53] earth
[59:58] no
[59:59] terminologies wording to try to help the
[1:00:03] human mind
[1:00:06] understand where you and I are
[1:00:11] at but
[1:00:12] remember one
[1:00:17] thing everything is
[1:00:21] created that
[1:00:23] exist it was created by the word of
[1:00:32] God
[1:00:35] now why would it be any problem then
[1:00:41] to thinking
[1:00:49] about why would it be any problem to
[1:00:51] think that God chose this Earth that you
[1:00:54] and I I live
[1:00:56] on he took it out as the prophet said
[1:00:59] and let it go through a nice age and let
[1:01:01] it do the things and then he brings it
[1:01:04] back into existence things and then that
[1:01:08] is day one day two day
[1:01:13] three of what we call the creative acts
[1:01:16] of God that these things start coming
[1:01:18] into
[1:01:19] being you know the light then this then
[1:01:22] the trees and the grass
[1:01:25] and then the animals and then the you
[1:01:27] know the dividing of De this St three
[1:01:30] and what it four and five or four five
[1:01:33] and six it defines there the animals
[1:01:35] start to be created on one day and the
[1:01:36] rest of them created on another day you
[1:01:38] know all and uh why not think about
[1:01:43] it as being the great Eternal god with
[1:01:46] his plan and purpose to use this Earth
[1:01:50] that you and I live
[1:01:52] on to make this his is
[1:01:55] permanent Dwelling Place in this
[1:02:05] existence I like the wording that he
[1:02:07] used one day he said the reason there's
[1:02:10] 30 minutes with silence in heaven he
[1:02:12] said they just ain't nothing up there I
[1:02:14] got a tickle when I heard that I thought
[1:02:16] you know that's
[1:02:19] right if he comes down here he's not up
[1:02:23] there
[1:02:27] right angels and everything come here
[1:02:30] they're not up
[1:02:34] there but you see I what I believe is
[1:02:37] that Supernatural world is coming to
[1:02:40] this
[1:02:44] world the Eternal God came to this
[1:02:53] earth
[1:02:55] I ain't worried about going to the moon
[1:03:00] stars I wouldn't mind taking a ride up
[1:03:02] there i' always like to do something
[1:03:04] like that I wouldn't mind going to the
[1:03:06] Moon with them right up and and back I
[1:03:08] just don't have the billions of dollars
[1:03:09] to be able afford it but uh you ever
[1:03:11] want to get rid of me just buy me a
[1:03:13] ticket and I I'll go up there cuz I'm
[1:03:16] not afraid of those things I I really
[1:03:18] enjoy
[1:03:19] it and I've always told you that it
[1:03:22] wouldn't have bothered me when they
[1:03:24] first went to the moon to have found
[1:03:28] spaceships sitting on the
[1:03:30] moon to have
[1:03:33] found module never what's that word for
[1:03:38] cities what bother me
[1:03:41] today he said why because they come from
[1:03:47] here if they could tell Noah that it
[1:03:50] wasn't going to
[1:03:53] rain
[1:03:54] you know they could have been flying
[1:03:56] around up in space a long time
[1:03:59] ago but remember it would be coming from
[1:04:03] here it would be marked on the outside
[1:04:06] of the thing us
[1:04:09] steel
[1:04:11] right my point it' be coming from here
[1:04:14] that wouldn't have bothered
[1:04:17] me it would have oh the Christian
[1:04:19] world's all wrong with it no would have
[1:04:22] bothered me
[1:04:24] and said they come from
[1:04:27] here and I'd have been tickled to death
[1:04:30] because that have been a better way of
[1:04:31] telling knowing that it wouldn't going
[1:04:33] to
[1:04:35] rain but see God had water
[1:04:39] reserved in an atmosphere that their
[1:04:42] scientific instruments would not read
[1:04:47] about there were more scientific there
[1:04:49] than we are in today even before I heard
[1:04:52] of brother brandom I read it about in
[1:04:53] the 6 60s that they found those uh
[1:04:58] uh pyramids down in Mexico and that they
[1:05:01] had found
[1:05:04] batteries in those pyramids that were
[1:05:08] actually capable of like our
[1:05:12] batteries maybe not looking like them
[1:05:14] but made to be able to do what our
[1:05:17] batteries
[1:05:20] do you see we we want to make all that
[1:05:23] thing as being not
[1:05:26] true I want to take it and incorporate
[1:05:28] it into my understanding as to where
[1:05:31] that the great Superior Eternal God came
[1:05:34] from an existence that we know nothing
[1:05:36] of in the human
[1:05:40] part that he was a
[1:05:42] man not a floating
[1:05:46] Spirit not just a glob floating
[1:05:53] around
[1:05:54] remember he created man in his own image
[1:05:58] so whatever image the man is that was
[1:06:00] the image God was in before he created
[1:06:02] to man or am I am I
[1:06:09] right are you following me so remember
[1:06:12] in Genesis it speaks of Heaven and
[1:06:18] Earth but Paul speaks of
[1:06:22] Worlds and we'll get into it this
[1:06:24] evening where that all things were
[1:06:27] created by Him and without him there was
[1:06:29] not anything made that was made who
[1:06:32] Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ not the flesh
[1:06:38] man the Eternal
[1:06:44] God we existed before anything and you
[1:06:48] say he existed
[1:06:50] alone not because it's just
[1:06:53] one
[1:06:56] but then he begin to create and he
[1:06:57] created
[1:07:00] angels they worshiped him he becomed in
[1:07:03] our word God and that's why you go over
[1:07:06] to
[1:07:07] Genesis right come on the Bible is
[1:07:11] exactly right what does it say in
[1:07:12] Genesis
[1:07:13] 1:1 God created the heavens and the
[1:07:16] Earth what
[1:07:20] God that had already been worshiped by
[1:07:22] the Angels
[1:07:24] so the world didn't come first the
[1:07:26] Angels come before the
[1:07:29] world and he was already with the word
[1:07:31] god
[1:07:35] Elohim see then he could be that one
[1:07:38] true and living God that we talk
[1:07:44] about you see what we've been doing is
[1:07:47] contacting that other
[1:07:50] world to the Revelation
[1:07:52] remember
[1:07:54] may I quote the
[1:07:56] prophet that heaven consists of
[1:08:00] what thank you Heaven consists of the
[1:08:06] word to whatever it comes from whatever
[1:08:09] we think about come from the word the
[1:08:11] spoken
[1:08:13] word and a better way of saying it
[1:08:16] Heaven consist of
[1:08:22] faith
[1:08:25] then we're going to get down into some
[1:08:27] little things with the scriptures and
[1:08:29] this is a background to try to get this
[1:08:31] in your
[1:08:33] mind that God is not through
[1:08:38] creating now he created a physical world
[1:08:41] all right he's not having to create more
[1:08:44] worlds we're not into
[1:08:49] that but one day he
[1:08:52] took what came out of this
[1:08:55] Earth in the form of a
[1:09:02] fish and he multiplied
[1:09:06] it
[1:09:08] right that fish come out of this
[1:09:13] Earth but yet he multiplied that showing
[1:09:16] he was the great God the
[1:09:19] Creator
[1:09:22] right
[1:09:24] nothing since then now watch this point
[1:09:28] nothing since then has been created out
[1:09:31] of Earth unless God used it or done
[1:09:35] it he said when you say it like that
[1:09:38] because here comes a prophet that God
[1:09:41] challenged him about Mark 11 and says
[1:09:44] you need squirrels he didn't take a
[1:09:46] squirrel off a tree and multiply it into
[1:09:49] another
[1:09:50] squirrel cuz you're going more back to
[1:09:53] the original
[1:09:56] he
[1:09:58] spoke not take a fish and multiply
[1:10:02] it he
[1:10:12] spoke get back to this this
[1:10:15] evening I thought we
[1:10:20] believed this
[1:10:22] message
[1:10:27] you know
[1:10:31] what brother Ramon one day he said I
[1:10:34] prayed for a man's
[1:10:36] nose and it said he'd come back on his
[1:10:39] face ate off of cancer he said it took a
[1:10:43] while he say it's
[1:10:47] worthy he said or Roberts prayed I
[1:10:50] believe it was him or would FF BOS which
[1:10:52] BOS said he prayed and it came back
[1:10:58] instantly now if that wasn't a creative
[1:11:00] act I want you to explain something to
[1:11:02] me but see you think see your mind's
[1:11:04] hung on what you think a quote is that
[1:11:06] he finished physical creation that's
[1:11:09] right the squirrels that brother Brown
[1:11:12] spoke into existence come out of
[1:11:15] whatever brought this world is where
[1:11:17] they came
[1:11:19] from he never picked up dirt and said
[1:11:22] because you got it in the book of mcab
[1:11:23] you got it in those things if you read
[1:11:26] on some of those you got it in there to
[1:11:28] where that Jesus in the story is told
[1:11:30] that he's down making little birds of
[1:11:32] clay and somebody walks up and he goes
[1:11:35] and they just come alive and fly
[1:11:42] off but where did that squirrel come
[1:11:46] from that your Prophet
[1:11:50] said it came into
[1:11:52] existence and he said I ate
[1:11:58] him right or maybe he said we because he
[1:12:02] probably give to
[1:12:06] somebody but you
[1:12:10] see I thought that he said I got it away
[1:12:14] on over in the
[1:12:15] message that he said let me say this
[1:12:18] from my own Revelation it's out of the
[1:12:21] seal book think is God in Simplicity I'm
[1:12:25] not certain he said let me say this he
[1:12:28] said according to my own Revelation I
[1:12:29] won't say he told me he according to my
[1:12:32] own Revelation said one day limbs will
[1:12:34] be
[1:12:38] restored
[1:12:40] okay you got a hand missing it's done
[1:12:44] been put in the ground or some dog ated
[1:12:47] or
[1:12:48] something where is that coming back
[1:12:52] from
[1:12:58] brother Mo said he sat with AA Isen and
[1:13:01] watched him and the man said everybody
[1:13:03] bow your head he said I didn't bow mine
[1:13:05] I sat and looked he said I was up close
[1:13:08] to the front and I wanted to
[1:13:10] see he said I looked at that boy or who
[1:13:13] who it was there and he said 6
[1:13:18] Ines he said I watched him he said it
[1:13:21] growed right out
[1:13:24] oh they just faked that he had his leg
[1:13:26] pulled up and then go right ahead play
[1:13:29] all you want to see because you don't
[1:13:31] believe it can be done I believe it can
[1:13:33] be done I don't care if that was a fake
[1:13:37] right right I don't care if that was a
[1:13:40] fake I believe it can be
[1:13:43] done remember he asked a little girl I
[1:13:45] believe it was he said or prayed for her
[1:13:48] she had no eyeballs in her
[1:13:52] sockets and he prayed for her and he
[1:13:54] stopped he went back he said oh honey
[1:13:56] said by the way said what color eyes do
[1:13:59] you
[1:14:00] want she had heard of Stories of the sky
[1:14:04] and the things I'm sure how beautiful it
[1:14:07] was and she said I want blue
[1:14:11] eyes he said immediately the eyes
[1:14:14] appeared in the
[1:14:17] socket do we believe that God can still
[1:14:22] create
[1:14:24] cuz remember now my point
[1:14:28] is from that
[1:14:30] time that he created a physical
[1:14:33] creation then anything that's created
[1:14:36] now will come from the same original
[1:14:39] creation that that came into being
[1:14:42] from are you with
[1:14:45] me and that it was put here in the earth
[1:14:48] and could do but he can go right back to
[1:14:50] the
[1:14:52] original
[1:14:54] let's
[1:14:56] stand you see
[1:14:59] Church we've had a wonderful God to
[1:15:03] bring us a wonderful
[1:15:04] message for us to be able to
[1:15:07] see that he's still
[1:15:13] God and that Faith truly is the
[1:15:19] substance this world
[1:15:22] came into being by the word of God that
[1:15:27] word of God was spoken from the mouth of
[1:15:29] almighty God that could bring into
[1:15:32] existence what was in his mind from no
[1:15:37] existence
[1:15:38] whatsoever of anything
[1:15:41] before he didn't take a rock take it
[1:15:44] over and make a do and make an earth and
[1:15:46] multiply and build it up he just spoke
[1:15:48] it into
[1:15:52] B the prophet
[1:15:54] said if under the blood of bulls and
[1:15:59] goats flies fleas and frogs could come
[1:16:02] into
[1:16:03] be a creative act from the words of a
[1:16:07] man named
[1:16:10] Moses he said where why would we stumble
[1:16:13] at squirrels being spok into
[1:16:16] existence under the blood of Jesus
[1:16:21] Christ oh I sit there this morning look
[1:16:23] at I won't get to it this evening
[1:16:26] but Abel's
[1:16:28] Revelation could
[1:16:35] speak does your Revelation
[1:16:38] speak can you tell me your
[1:16:41] Revelation well now brother Dale I've
[1:16:43] got this great Revelation but I can't
[1:16:44] explain it we just go on till you
[1:16:50] can you're not impressing me and I'm
[1:16:53] doing my best to explain what I
[1:16:58] believe I believe in the Eternal
[1:17:01] God one who existed all by himself back
[1:17:06] in the eternities of eternities before
[1:17:08] eternity was ever even thought about you
[1:17:11] ever heard the prophet say in the
[1:17:12] beginning before the
[1:17:15] Eternal now that's the supernatural
[1:17:18] being before the Eternal because that's
[1:17:21] a word we use
[1:17:25] right I believe this world came from
[1:17:30] that world or whatever you want to call
[1:17:32] it what do we got 381 3 381 this power
[1:17:37] anybody have a
[1:17:38] need world is not my home just a passing
[1:17:44] through my treasures are
[1:17:46] laid somewhere beond after the god I
[1:17:49] believe in a real God angs me
[1:17:56] why would we stumble when the prophet
[1:17:58] would
[1:17:59] say the new word is the person of Jesus
[1:18:03] Christ coming and living in
[1:18:08] you not
[1:18:10] my Lord what will I do the Angels beckon
[1:18:15] me
[1:18:17] from why would we stumble about speaking
[1:18:20] the
[1:18:21] word
[1:18:25] try that Wednesday night to get you SI
[1:18:27] and let you
[1:18:30] speak of your own Revelation
[1:18:36] fix were things that
[1:18:40] happen you
[1:18:43] know you had nothing to do with
[1:18:47] it something else was taking
[1:18:50] place you know I I believe the god of
[1:18:55] Glory can still
[1:18:57] speak I believe he can
[1:19:09] create what about you what do you think
[1:19:12] about
[1:19:16] God you say well God is just a spirit
[1:19:19] then that's what you
[1:19:21] believe
[1:19:24] viory you believe he's just a spirit and
[1:19:27] you're more real than he
[1:19:33] is see how dumb we
[1:19:42] are
[1:19:44] Heaven anybody have what will I do the
[1:19:49] Angels Be Me from heaven open door and I
[1:19:56] feel in this
[1:20:02] world oh Lord you
[1:20:04] know I have no friend like
[1:20:08] you if Heaven's not my
[1:20:13] home but you see we've always wanted to
[1:20:16] go
[1:20:17] up right well what if you down on the
[1:20:20] other side of the earth which your way
[1:20:22] are you going you say that's dumb you
[1:20:25] explain
[1:20:28] it but on the other side of the earth
[1:20:30] they're pointing
[1:20:33] up you can't explain
[1:20:37] that somebody is looking
[1:20:44] down are there is
[1:20:47] a supernatural Dimension that is
[1:20:50] controlling all things that allows all
[1:20:53] of us to look
[1:20:58] up you see I don't want to go up there I
[1:21:01] want him to come down
[1:21:02] here I stopped many many years ago you
[1:21:05] heard me say it said I'm not going to
[1:21:08] try to go to heaven
[1:21:10] anymore people looked at me I said
[1:21:13] because I believe Heaven's going to come
[1:21:17] here right here is the center of the
[1:21:20] whole
[1:21:21] thing believe that
[1:21:25] then whatever is out
[1:21:28] there that's just our
[1:21:31] playground that one day we can just
[1:21:34] Journey down through Brother G there
[1:21:36] will be no tiredness and we can walk up
[1:21:38] to Mars to Venus
[1:21:43] whatever and we look things
[1:21:48] over you
[1:21:51] realize if you brought this Earth so
[1:21:55] many feet closer to the sun right now it
[1:21:58] would burn
[1:22:03] up you realize if you moved it so many
[1:22:06] feet away from the Sun it would freeze
[1:22:09] over but do you realize if you started
[1:22:11] moving it toward the sun until you
[1:22:14] reached a certain spot you're going to
[1:22:21] freeze come
[1:22:23] on is it not cooler up around Delan Blue
[1:22:27] Ridge right now than it is here you know
[1:22:30] why because of the higher
[1:22:36] elevation you see if we went in towards
[1:22:38] the sun we think we just immediately
[1:22:39] burn no there's a freezing atmosphere
[1:22:42] then a burning up because we're set in a
[1:22:44] perfect
[1:22:49] place right where we're supposed to be
[1:22:52] because God framed
[1:22:55] it that what Paul said framed it put it
[1:22:59] in the place that it can be
[1:23:02] used you know one other definition even
[1:23:05] says makes it fat I like that one
[1:23:08] because I'm
[1:23:13] fat what do we
[1:23:16] think what kind of a god do you
[1:23:21] have I believe God is
[1:23:24] real he's not a thought of your
[1:23:27] imagination he's
[1:23:31] real lord Jesus we thank you for what
[1:23:35] you have brought unto
[1:23:37] us we've tried to explain it Lord we
[1:23:40] know and realize
[1:23:42] that it takes a revelation to
[1:23:48] understand that the worlds were actually
[1:23:50] framed by the word of God
[1:23:53] that where we're at right now is the
[1:23:55] actual place that you wanted it to be
[1:23:58] before the world ever
[1:24:00] begun you made this Earth to be
[1:24:03] inhabited according to your
[1:24:08] word Lord let us just be the people that
[1:24:11] inhabit it go with us as we eat a
[1:24:14] natural meal bring us back together this
[1:24:15] afternoon we love you we thank you in
