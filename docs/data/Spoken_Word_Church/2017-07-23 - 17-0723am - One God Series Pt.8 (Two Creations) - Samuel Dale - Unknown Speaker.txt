Before I close this subject, I know there is a question in your minds. You will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of preexistence. I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the preexistence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls. Be careful here and see this. It is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God, IT IS THE WORD, OR SEED. That is it. Way back there, too far back for the human mind to grasp, the Eternal God with eternal thoughts, thought and decreed,
 "JACOB HAVE I LOVED, BUT ESAU HAVE I HATED,

«  46       †          Now, in the beginning God dwelled alone, with His attributes, as I spoke of this morning. That's His thoughts. There was nothing, just God alone, but He had thoughts.
Just like a great architect can set down, in his mind, and draw out what he thinks it's he's going to--to build. Create, now, he cannot create. He can take something that's been created and make it in a different form; 'cause God is the only way... only One can create. But he gets in his mind what he's going to do, and that's his thoughts, that's his desires. Now it's a thought, and then he speaks it, and it's a word then. And a--a word is...
47    A thought, when it's expressed, it's a word. A thought expressed is a word, but it has to be a thought first. So, it's God's attributes; then it becomes a thought, then a word.

«  67       †          That's the way He was. He was in the beginning by Himself. God dwelt alone with His thoughts. He'll never do that again 'cause His thoughts are being made manifest. And that's why we are right here, this day... is God fellowshipping with His thoughts, being made manifest. See? There we are. So, you, by taking thought, cannot add one cubit to your stature. You...

forest Winston I really enjoyed it and then I prayed that that's the beginning of a seeing these brothers coming in from overseas I've always tried to tell you I believe if God is revealing himself here he's revealing himself around the world and I believe that so you know I look forward to that I meant to see all that good to see Robby back there with us all right you like turning into article with with us in John now where we're trying to back up to where we were a couple of services ago and try to pick up you know our thought and continue on you know John one in Genesis one the only father we thank you for the grace and love that you bestowed unto each and every one of us that you would allow us to be able to come together they would fellowship together around your word and that you'd reveal your word and to us and that you'd open the eyes of our understanding truly that we may see you because that's the purpose in order to serve you is all that we desire anything we ask you to help us and guide us and through what we would speak and what to say to your people you direct our thoughts we love you and we just commit everything to you vie with each and every one you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we depend upon that and you just come forward and minister yourself unto us forgive our sins because we want to be covered by the blood of Jesus Christ and got us and keep us in Jesus name Amen okay John 1 we've been reading this for a while but that's alright it doesn't wear out does it so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now let's go to Genesis 1 a very familiar scripture with all of us to read to bring our thoughts when God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it how dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth the Lord said amen to his word today you may be seated and we've been for some time now this makes eight messages that we're trying to bring a thought and we're where our thought is to one thing is to keep in our understanding to the right place to where we can understand what God is trying to reveal to us all right now we're still back before the foundation of the world we haven't come down I would I told you I'll announce it when we start dealing we will deal with some things today this morning that will be relating to those things but we will announce when we come to earth with our thinking we're still up in heaven and what are we doing back in the mind of God that God before the foundation of the world if we're going to believe there is a God why would we not believe that His infinite wisdom would allow him before the world ever would begin for him to know everything that would ever take place upon the earth ever that'd bad it's I you know I mean that Sardi go out in the yard and they just all over your face and you just think that God knows every one of them because we didn't he wouldn't be infinite what season by doing that why would we not believe that he before the foundation of the world could know all things and have a will read it no minute have a plan and a purpose in doing what he's doing and that way to express himself that's his point all right then in doing that then to bring that to a position that you and I would understand what part we are and the part we're playing into the things of God now God in his mind then as I've told you over and over we've been through it God in his mind could set back before the world and see everything that would ever happen all right if not then you might well forget it I mean if you don't believe that kind of a God then go home because you're wasting time just go get drunk have you a good time do what you're going to do forget it because you're wasting God's time and yours too you say well you shouldn't talk that way well why not is it true I mean if you don't believe that God is real and not just a myth or a thought that we went through to try to bring just an idea or a concept of mankind a good thought you know or something like that and not believing how real he is then we might as well forget it because we're totally out of the any thoughts as I've always said to you anybody in the Bible that ever amounted to anything was a person that believed God's Word was speaking to them at that time showing it and being it and directing them for the time that he was doing that all right see than in that it's not nothing new pulled over on God you know well I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that them because I'm gonna pull some over on him you go ahead you your your that dumb just go ahead and do it because you forget it but now thinking about it see that God in his mind that he would see everything are you going to limit him to where he can't do those things because remember not my point is this if we try to limit God do you know what we're doing now if we say God didn't know this or God doesn't know this or God can't do this or God can't do that if we're in limiting God in any way we're making ourselves greater than he is now that's as easy as I can make it to you if we in any way think we have anything to do with it I'll get back to it in a minute what was his plan and purpose to express himself to her we're part of the expression but remember it's expressing him and we'll get to that in a minute because I have a thought I was trying to get to it in the last message and you know we were dealing with the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and how that God before the world could write every name in the book of life I leave them out then he would have books that would cover other things which would be people's and you know and all like that and all written in the books but the main thing is to have to whether or not your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life section that is eternal the other is thoughts in his mind and people in that don't have eternal life that's the thing I want you to deal with today and you're thinking we'll get to it in a few minutes we're going to deal with two creations we're going to talk about two creations one of those is God and his offspring in his way he comes the other one is the natural world and things see then that way if you'll take it and listen so you won't come up with stumbling questions in the prophets message so you'll see that he'll say like Christ from history he said first thank God creators angels and they worshiped him all right but then go back into Christ and mystery of God revealed this a little bit in it and he'll come forth and he'll say it like this he'll say the first creation would light then he'll say he was his first creation well you know what he's exactly right in all three things he said if we get it in the right order now if we don't we've got it all bumfuzzled seen you read that's reading I say things like it because I know what the human mind does you read the message or you hear the Prophet say something and then you'll remember something else he said well I remember he said this over here I remember he said this over here I was telling brother Shetty you never wanted his points he was bringing out I don't remember what it was but one of his points he's bringing out he was bringing it out correctly but it was an offline quote to the point that he was quoting and it wasn't exactly the wording of brother Branham and people's birthday I didn't read the rest at Sean's oh I know he he missed the whole point that a person is trying to bring the whole thing because how smart you are to be able to comprehend you think I've got it right continue you know that's what it is you got to write the thing and that's what are you doing she said I think right and so that's messed it up so that's what's going to mess us all up what I think we don't have no rights we forfeit our rights by becoming Christians we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior and we don't have no more rights after them like I write this note no we don't because you forfeit your rights by accepting him or else you're not going to have eternal life all right now so we were talking about the book of life of the Lamb and I say it that way because see there is a technical point that you can do the book of life and then you can do the book of the life of the lamb slain all right the book of life can be Judas's name was written in the book of life and was taken out okay but Judas's name was not written in the Lamb's Book of Life section of eternal life and then be removed that will not work all right so then you got it in the correct order to understand okay so then before the foundation of the world in God's mind he could see every person that would ever be in the world and everything that would ever happen and he could write our name in the Lamb's Book of Life section eternal or he could put our names in the book of life or he could leave our names out because it's his choice and his doings all right now see then that's the eternal thoughts of God remember what we've been trying to bring out God dwelt alone with his attributes when are they his thoughts his desires he dwelt alone he was self existing nobody would dwell with him and we didn't dwell with him get all that out of your mind would you but you sound like you believe in pre-existed I believe in pre existence of eternal life I do not believe in pre existence of people but we'll get to it in a minute where the Prophet said in church age book one they say he said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed all right so that solves the problem I have no problems with predestination one because the Bible says those he foreknew he did predestinate so foreknowledge comes first all right now if you go by foreknowledge then you have no trouble you know but that just don't give me that that don't let me feel like it that I feel like this is right over here I feel this good if you feel that's fine but what about the word what does the word say it's not what we feel is what the word says all right now so we went through that to bring out that God had written their names in the book of the life of the lamb slain or either he didn't write it seasoned that away it's left up to him to fulfill all that what he's going to do and remember by his foreknowledge he not only saw that you would accept eternal life and could write your name in the book of life of the Lamb or he could by seeing that you would not accept him as your Savior he could leave your name on so then for knowledge covers the whole thing at the same time don't misunderstand me because I'm making it so strong about his mind and the way I'm approaching it I'm afraid you're going to get the idea that I'm trying to drive too hard a point my point is what in his mind he saw who would accept him and he saw who wouldn't at the same time so that don't give something special about us we'll get the end of the message there is something special about us if we believe it right all right then we went through that okay then we went into word that we're talking about what took place before the foundation of the world the Bible said the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world horn so we went back to see that this was in his mind and he done it before the foundation of the world or at the same time something was taking place job said where were you when the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy in the morning stars are the children of God the sons of God shouted for joy they're the sons and daughters of God but the angels were singing the first time they sang you remember the Prophet said they sang in heaven as a rejoicing and you think about it like I've said in God's mind see we want to limit that mind instead of it instead of looking at it and seeing how much that we're just gradually seeing the mind as it unfolds because of our ability to understand not because of what he's doing we're just figuring they're scratching the surface to understand his mind because easy to eternal God Joe said where were you when the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy then guarded his mind before the foundation of the world at the same time you remember I gave you the quote for the prophecy could this be you needed my got him laying here be Leonard he said could this be where the Morningstar Sangha he said could it be when our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life now you're getting to something more regal right you know not just talking about his mind you're getting to something more real to the fact that those sons and daughters of God could shout for joy and gave you where the Prophet said it he said when they seen the plan of redemption come into view why were they shouting for joy because they saw the plan because they saw I gave you the quote from the Prophet where it was they saw the Savior coming forth who's who it is they the sons and daughters of God they saw it what made the angels shout so well they shouted because the sons and daughters of God shouted know the Angels shouted because they knew they were going to have something to do with God's plan and purpose the Angels well that's what's your profit see the Angels would shout or see it right around will you shout one down another time you'll say cry in a relational board okay I do those things because something I get them smarter that's all so he said Jojo fix it well I try to put it towards it you won't argue the point in any way all right but think about it according to the Bible those angels are ministering spirits ministering spirits as Hebrews 1:13 but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation and angels have a job they were created for a purpose I got it laying in here to where the Prophet said only the redeemed of angels see we thank this and we thank all the little angels right here little angels of their questions and answers in 1964 paragraph 53 p2 money only the redeemed of angels it isn't promised that sinners has angels it's only the redeemed of angels did you know that so the angels of the Lord and counseled about those that fear Him I love the way brother Branham speaks the Bible does not say angels of God the yet brother Branham winter relates it back to the Bible says the angel singer of God because it takes the holy spirit to cover all of those angels so only the redeemed of angels you mean we had angels brother instead we did they took care of us they got us the Bible says it in that those angels then why what knows angels sing' think about it in his mind there he is and he's talking and the sons and daughters of God are enjoying it and they says I'm gonna bring a plan and purpose into view and you're going to be part of that plan the purpose and said now the Angels have got their part in angels / kupets and what they're going to be ministering spirits to ministers to the Eyres of salvation and remember a love those on angels fail so they didn't hold their estate now don't you think that's going to be bad they're not going to get no rewards no we're down the road they're going to be annihilated with somebody yesterday waiting on going down to the hunting land a little bit you know the bible does say why does it set this way says you'll judge angel it don't say you'll judge people it does in the basis that it goes on to talking about you but it Langley says you'll judge angel remember those angels are the ones that supposed to be helping us so who you think's going to judge them you understand what I'm getting actually before the world something was taking place and if God was explaining what he was going to do the sons and daughters of God saw the plan of redemption come into view and as he did those angels saw it come into view - and they begin to rejoice about what they were going to be able to do so you're following that story of what we were trying to bring out so the morning stars and all like that or before the foundation of the world then we tap just a little bit right at the end of the message talking about the Genesis 1:26 and 27 28 there man and how that man was created I won't get to a word in a minute I want you to hold it but that man came into being as a child of God that man came into being before the world ever begun was not a creation that's why it says let us make man then it says when you get over to Genesis two and seven let us form man a lot of difference from creating form and a lot of the words that we use but we'll get to it and then it and think about it he then before the foundation of the world God you say well it was just in his mind just remember what he saw in his mind is taking place today I love the quote where brother Branham says he said he dwelt along with his thoughts but he said he'll never do that again he said because we are those attributes made manifest he will never dwell alone again that's wonderful to think about that before the world he saw you and knew what you would do well then you sound like and all this predestination sound like we don't have nothing to do with it just remember he saw you in his mind saying that he knew you would say that so don't think that way try to understand the simplicity of God in his ways of doing things instead of trying to figure out what he's doing the Genesis 1:26 man then when was that man brought into being I don't use the word create because I want to use the word brought into being creates fine if you didn't know what you're doing that was before the Prophet said before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world this 1:26 27 men came into being as a spiritual man because God was a spirit and he created man in his own image but Rena said he created man in the theophany he said because he was at the optic well that's in words that get me all confused it's just getting the simplicity when God created man he created him in the image of himself because he is an expansion of himself a child of God is an expansion of the Father right means that truth because the life comes from the father right see then as he brings us into being upon the earth he knows whether or not you're going to accept him or not you don't think about like brother Branham major statement one time I love his dog he said said now you you some of you said maybe you remember how the things was just a little different with you he said how you were different than the other children around you he said could that be God's Way of doing nothing now if the angels were assigned to the errors of salvation that angel wouldn't have to wait until you're born again to come true you would he could be with you all of your life yeah but I've never seen angels or anything like that well that's all right don't you believe it I mean you know what else you're going to do only the redeemed of angels so then only the redeemed have someone to help them because it's for the heirs of salvation you don't realize what happened to you maybe the day that you became a born-again Christian I remember a brother telling the story one time and the story was that the brother branham told him said other words said they drug you here said you just through a bad time of coming and said they drug you here he went to the brother and asked him this other one did said what he don't know I got in the car went up her he he didn't know his even going home but God was dragging him up there bringing him to a place yeah but you sound like that your predestination is got something to do with what we do I'm glad you thought of that because that's exactly what I believe I believe you've got to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior not that he's going to make you he can't make you and override your Fremont agency I liked well brother Tom far boys used to say he said we trigger our own predestination I like that idea we do trigger our predestination in other words our predestination by God's foreknowledge but then we're here in life we're living each day now listen now then to get to a point is it necessary that I read as I can surely give you a whole lot or to know that but brother branham he said I'll just run through these real fast he said in the church eggs book he said I don't believe in the Mormon doctrine of pre existence of souls he said neither do I believe in reincarnation our transmigration you know reincarnation means you've something here and you come over to something else and knowledge that no transmigration means that you're going from one body to another and he said I don't believe in that but he believed in predestination all Bible believers believe in predestination one by God's foreknowledge and he said it's not to person their 154 church it's not the person that kind of predestination eternally from God it's the word or seed I thought we went to a sermon for you to remember these things that was laying down via River what I'm saying now I thought we went to a message where we were talking about that God first dwelt along with his dog and he said it wasn't word yet he said then his thoughts became word he said then it could be spoken if there's anything about you and me and anything is the fact of accepting God's Word I wish you'd get that into your mind why is it you're different than anybody else you accepted what God said when others wouldn't accept it when others wouldn't have it which is just something about it that it rung into you when you heard the word when the truth struck our pipe is just something different he said well I don't understand that one thing about it ain't what it used to be it might not be what I need to be or one baby ain't what he used to be something's don't happen to me and it happened because I heard the word how long did it take that angel to get you in that place to listen to that word I told you I'm on his eye I'm not joking I'm honest I kind of believe that he assigned to two men keep up with me cuz it was gonna be too bad you know I don't think one angel was capable of handling at all I'm just saying that as a point but it's the truth and I'm certainly going to apologize to it when I get started I've seen a few things in my life it made me wonder about a lot of other things too but that's all right now listen so then I'm just trying to back ground enough for you to think now if you believe let's get the point just come down prove it Lester if you believe the Bible that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and all the names were written in that book see we got all that stories you know that's a new name written down in glory we get all those things we think it's good but just remember brother Branham will even talk about a name transferred just remember he's not talking about eternal life eternal life is eternal life that's why the people can't understand brother Branham brother Brent said we always was eternal but read what he said if you have eternal life eternal life always was eternal now you've got plain enough sense if you ain't come up here and somebody bring me a hammer and let's illustrate to make sure that you understand that you're still human and if you're not eternal and let me tap that toe and see how you feel he said well that's silly no it's not silly it's expressing it oh I always loved eternal what are you getting older for come on you're defeating your own purpose and you always was eternal because you're trying to believe with something about you to be in eternal other than what the Bible and the Prophet is explaining because I'm a firm believer in pre existence of eternal life and I believe that eternal life that you receive the day you were born again always was eternal but you had to receive it I believe the Bible says the lamb stood slain before the foundation of the world but what if he hadn't in 2000 years ago on Calvary what if he did not do it it would prove to be false prophecy right so then aren't thinking all right you're thinking we admit that before the foundation of the world that we talk about the the book of life being written well that's names we talk about the morning starts saying togetherness under God shouted for joy and that's for the foundation of world because their names were written in the book come on I got them laying here if you want you order done Rhett you've read them over and over I'll give them to you every time see then for sure we are to understand that to Genesis 1:26 and 27 lamb it's not a physical being your prophet explained it over and over and over and over then he's a spiritual being was even made before the foundation of the world was he created before the world or did God just start expanding himself I thought from Christ a mystery of God revealed it was in order to let himself be expressed that he had a plan and a purpose of hidden mystery a hidden mystery one that this man that was created in Genesis 1:26 27 he never had no beginning and he will never have an ende comes s guards impartation of his own life yet we get it all tied up in two ways and trying to think out things that should have accepted it as simple to believe that God before the world ever begun he had a plan and a purpose according to Christ a mystery of God revealed that he was going to have to express himself now listen to what I'm saying for a second we talked about him being a healer if you had an attribute to be a healer we talked about that right had you ever thought about why he's a healer but I'm just asking you ever thought about why he wanted to be a healer I said another day pondering that thought you know I why did he want to be a healer what he just wanted to show that he could that he could heal him it's alright but why did he want to be a healer not listening to the prophet and he gave the key he wanted to be a healer where he could display the attribute of the Resurrection now are you listening he wanted to be a healer so he could display the attribute of the Resurrection now may I quote brother Branham about 4,000 times no divine healing no resurrection is it because the divine healing is just an earnest of your full inheritance and he wouldn't want to just be a healer for the purpose of somebody being sick and him like him well because every time anybody's sick and is made well if showing the resurrection isn't he wanted to show the resurrection maybe we'll get around to more I'm just saying I get it maybe we'll find out why he wanted to be this one you know that there's I've always explained to you and angels worshiping that will make him God he didn't have to create mankind to be a god you know Angels could worship Him and you know that when he created Adam and Eve in the garden that made him father these are not to bring nobody else to be a father maybe one day we'll realize why all of these things are taking place like that this is setting thinking and wondering pondering over the thought and here comes a prophet he said divine healing shows the resurrection see that was his plan to shew the resurrection was come on he would have to go through a resurrection one day himself am i right did Jesus go through a resurrection see it keeps unfolding we go through the point of thinking that well this is just in God's mind yeah but what about being a part of God's mind you know yourself I've always said that I don't want to be what God thought of that's fine it's that's enough for you that's okay I don't want to just be what he thought of because he thought of Judas Iscariot that's what I said there a moment ago the same time that he saw your name and wrote your name in the Lamb's Book a lot he saw somebody else over here and left there is I at the same time didn't how two stories to bring forward who didn't think about the church think about Jesus Christ I know I asked for you to think I'm not the popcorn preachers that can preach real fiest I've never been that I've always just been myself so you have to put up with that part all right I wish you'd get it like one brother one time little brother motors on preaching a certain Church and we were over there and he said he said brother most going priest Martin I said he's gonna preach to us they did all he's a teacher like you know he said but this brother tonight said he's going to run now house and shout glory hallelujah and you thought you know let's see oh wait a minute it kind of looked like I'm throwing off on this over here isn't here he said well what it is he said no no brother boat was supposed to preach that night and the brothers folks preached the night after huh he said he said what it is he said we'll hear from brother mote watch this brothers gonna tell us a shout about it kind of quick to think all right why not think about things the way God does it maybe you need the quotes in the times from the Prophet where did he sends that before the foundation of the world this Genesis 1:26 man come into being are can you put it there by the book of life in the Lamb and the names or can you put it dire by the morning stars sang together nurse under guard shouting for joy where was this 126 man created he was never created he had no beginning remember anything that has a beginning has an ending the beginning reference is not a beginning as we talked about a beginning we know that but it's referencing that they was a starting point to things that are being there happening and can be called a beginning but a real beginning has no beginning no end into a real beginning a real D turning life yeah I firmly believe the words brought around and said he said we always was he trying what's he talking about if we always was eternal one Jesus cries out to die well he just died to where we could come to the point of realizing that we always was it's a good thought a garbage can in it but it's a good call because if he didn't come and pay the price you can't have eternal life he had to give his life to where it could come upon you and I run do you follow me then trying to get you to just think about this Genesis 1:26 man and how he was a spirit man to profit on it he said he was creating the image of God he said he was created in tianni he was created back there he come into being yeah but I got what the Prophet said we buy pie start the ovni that's right we did to come to earth to be flesh to be came here right but Adam didn't bypass his you tell me he did I'm gonna quote the Prophet to you blasphemous name he's especially into the nostrils of Adam we breathe eternal life now you're going to either believe you were doubting with and you're going to do it anyway so don't matter but listen I'm trying to get you to see something the plan of salvation you see why those angels as I said a moment ago they're shouting because they realize they've got something to do with it what about before the world before anything ever comes into being it's all angels realize what they're going to do you know they're doing their part see I can't explain it but I know what the Prophet said he said those fallen angels give us a nature huh they're working on us so it don't matter which side the angels are on they're working on us right the Fallen Angels is working to take us away the true angels are trying to guard us - is that the way the Prophet says he said before that in the garden he said before that could happen he said he put the angels there with swords to guard the way of the Tree of Life because he knew what was on take place what about the angels knowing about it maybe one day we realize what the Prophet said one day when he was talking about something and he said those angels push remember that seventh seal it's in silver he said those angels hush he said because they know that they can't move a move unless it give away the secret nice prior phrase which is pretty close I'll be glad to find that for you he said those angels he said they hush he said everything in heaven huh sure he said that's why they silenced there he said because they can't say nothing it would give away the secret what's the secret according to Christ the mystery of God revealed when we started operating long ago or quoting what he say to express himself so then can you think about this man of one 26 and 27 is being a spirit man a part of God Genesis 2:7 they asked him a question remember the Prophet said it like this that he created two he said one was before the foundation world in other words 126 man he said Denny put that 126 man into two seven in a natural creation right but remember in his spiritual creation he was over all the animals remember that do we need to bring all these quotes like somebody said the other days about time to be able to get where we can believe it you're just one thing for sure you out there on the internet anything you want to do something if I say something you write me an Internet now write it and I ain't don't even writing it to me don't do it sensitive Church and join em against me because I can't read them anyway but it's something you want to know about I'll answer them question I ain't answering questions to people on no internet but I will answer where I've got the call from our outcome to the church and shape that was me I've never had no problems with it will stay with the prophets message to see where it works out do you understand what I'm getting at so then there is two creations that we got to deal with one of them is to bring in God's mind into view bring in what he had in his mind his attributes his things and to display those attributes Savior healer Redeemer all the things father God and all the different things but then he brought a natural thing into being a natural creation and the key is to watch what we're going to say anything that has a beginning has an Indian the angels were created of God but they were not a part of God they had a beginning mankind what about it alright they say a picture is better than a thousand words sometimes it's good to use it it confuses everybody so it's better than a thousand words because it'll confuse you better than a thousand words so you can take what you want to where you want it says understand it and help me or what you can say it confuse me so either way the picture is going to do one or the other I wrote the things and I had them to pass out and give you all of the notes of a picture of a drawing and we're going to pull it up on the screen does everybody get one of the drawings everybody get one that there it's doing it and this is brother Dale all right but did you get one too where we can move on that has all of it oh if you don't raise your hand who give them to get parents to give them if they got any more if you don't we'll make some more but see look up here now to creations so don't run all the way down through here now because if anything brother pull that down cuz that's the other way other way go there you go alright let's stop it because see you go down to that and you read all this down today and you're not listening what I'm sayin up here okay so we'll move it up a little at the time alright so look to creations first creation run around said was God Himself has no beginning right God didn't own the beginning his first creation was God himself what did he do he's simply coming forth to show himself to mankind right that's not a creation he didn't create a person and step over get out right away what did he do when the Prophet would say his first creation was God himself did he create this over here or did he step from being self existing over to logos or theophany to speak I put it in the message and I hope you'll listen when I get back to it on the next one I put a special message in this group of what does your God look like brother Branham said Hoffman's head of Christ was the closest he knew of what Jesus looked like I put a thing in there what was his name we know God's name his name is Jesus and we know he's a person that he's not just a myth I put a whole mess two messages in on that thought but was you listening I don't remember that message then we'll go back and listen it's on the internet when it says creation when it said in in Revelation 3:14 that he's the beginning of the creation of God wrote around said that does not mean God created Jesus and Jesus created everything else he said that is cream correct but he said that's what most of the people think about it see that are making two persons we just remember he self-existing he's been trying to condescend to the human being that the human being can understand him the first thing he does is become theophany logos speech but I put that picture in there because we're going to do it when we do the next one probably I enjoyed that one Holly's in Atlanta I've told you about it when they done that thing at the Passion Play and they always do it at different things and this first time they had this man they had this like walls and tongue I mean had it like it was nothing and then this man just stepped out into being and he began to say the letter B I don't know that was respira see you're not listening he said let there be let her be well the world come into being and the different things started happening you know and the next thing you heard was a baby crying on earth the next scene was the same man that was standing there saying let there be standing there as Jesus Christ you don't think like I do you don't think that when God stepped out there there he was real and when he did he just let there be because remember the point of trying to show one God is what Genesis 1 says God created all things right I guess that father or someone now according to John one Colossians one Ephesians is a three and nine or is it James tree and I wanted to you go to Colossians you can go to John and go to Hebrews and go then it says Jesus Christ created all things well you know what why can't you believe that before the world that stood Jesus Christ in the afternoon that Moses saw in theophany one can't you see that that was when it said let there be no you still want to go back to the spirit why not well we don't know it well that was the reason I put the message in it your prophet said that hoffman's 33 was the most closest picture of Jesus Christ that there was so then what a Jesus Christ look like well we're going to remove this one over here but I'm not going to tell you what we're going to put up there but we're going to remove that side because see people don't get my point this is a picture made this was a drawing made this was the picture made and he dropped it down and made it look like he was young man compared to this to being the old man with all the time so we're going to remove it and put something up because it'll show what I'm thinking I'm trying to explain something to them the other day some of us you see we saying open the eyes of my heart because that's what I'm preaching but don't be surprised one day when to come out here and I changed the theme song because according to what I'm preaching is the same song Lord open these eyes that we can see I like that when God is good all the time I surprised you use that as a theme song see I'm trying to get you to see what I'm talking about wherever the church things only believe or this out of the other I do it according to what's being made known at the time open the aisles Lord of our home all right so God is not a creation he's just me it's just words human words Jesus it says the beginning of the creation of God that's not God creating God that's just God stepping over into human flesh that's Jesus standing guard the beginning of the creation of God what's he doing here he's stepping forward from his point of not being able to be able to understand him or comprehend him in any form and then he just stepped over into another form remember the word in morphe he changes his form not him personality not his big it's corn all right look so then once it covered this man now watch this all the way through because this side of the line watch this side of the line all the way through there's going to be no creation on that side all of this side is going to be God unveiling his plan and purpose for mankind this will have a beginning because he he had a beginning on two creations this one is eternal this one had a beginning to follow this alter anything that had a beginning is not part of God but a creation of God that's why I don't just be in the mind of God because Satan was in the mind of God Judas was in the mind of God I want to be a part of the mind that does the thinking I want that part of me I thought that's what Paul said he said where's Christ and eula ability to think histology is that Scripture okay Roland oh no this we going out that away naturally fits Dejan you go which way you go okay so the Genesis 1:26 man made in the image of God not created part of God sons and daughters of God eternal life was before the foundation of the world well when did that we'll bring it on down to the court Connor okay look on the other side what was the first in like I said it here's brother Branham see you're reading brother Branham in that mind of yours read and he says God was his first creation I can't see three times then he says the first creation was like rosu it ought to be able to holler with alan remember in the bible life came into being before the moon and the sun king remember life it didn't come into being it was wherever God is is like am i right you need an example of it you remember in Goshen where the children of Israel was that it was like you remember outside it was darkness see there is no such thing as darkness cause darkness is announcements of light so when it says in the beginning there that he created life it didn't create light he just stepped over into another form and it just lit up right he didn't have to create it teachers ever where he's at now quotes from what scripture how about when we get over to the future at home you have no need of the light I'm according Christian because the lamb is the light is that scripture we're still in the Bible whether you're out every what you're doing with it we're still in the scripture see then this Genesis 1:26 man if God made manifest in another form bringing forth his bride okay then you get angels created that's what I'm saying you could at any mine you see first creation was life first creation was God first race was angel which ones right all three of them all the above because angels was the first thing that was made or created don't worry about it we we're talking we got some things and just remember just don't go too far we're thinking because remember Michael wasn't an angel okay we've got no problem with that we're studying it Michael was crushed and I have a little problem with Gabriel fitting him in there exactly yet but don't worry about it be nice you come to here you come in here go get him it's far but you remember there's two similar kind of angels there's cherubims there sheriffing seraphim's keep the worshiper clean that's Michael's job whatever who's with him is Michael job okay just show you we talk we get a little discussion in going down the road we ride and kind of talk well look angels retirin said with god's first creation exactly right he created angels angel had a beginning they're not part of God but was created by God they had a part to do in God's purpose plan and purpose that's the reason that came into being because they were going to be there to help us they're helping you right now what's keeping you from what happened you're going down the road in the car in front of your dog runs in front of the cow running from something happens in you have you ever been worded you were planning on going some way and something just said go the other way and you just turn and go the other way and you don't know why I just said I'm up all the guys that angel because I have problems and I won't argue with him don't you he keeps trying to tell me this that or the other either while I listen to him you know I'm you doing okay come on now look city spiritual man 126 placed in the garden Carew over every time actually 126 man spiritual man the beginning of the natural creation of the world animals things he created Adam in flesh created the soul of Adam was not created that's blasphemous name come on Adam had eternal life with Adam in flesh 2:7 had a beginning as a creation of God much but not part of God Adams flesh was not part of God it was God's creation your body or whatever you want think about it until it's made eternal it's not a part part of God it's just a part of these ol animals out here Wade was looking at a thing until it seems about some deer or something on the thing and I looked her I said hey I heard Bigfoot it was him standing working over here in the back of it went dark and our little Bigfoot then we found him brothers okay you see spiritual man he's in the garden this is still eternal but this is time starting and is it starting all of these things coming into being they are created of God but they're not eternal come on up I can't get it all in the way I wanted now look the fall Adam placing the time body and fell I see into death but this man in Adam never failed Adam fail but it's so never fail that's why I've been with you argued with you over priest about it we're ready Ryan says in the sealed book he talking about Adam fell from eternal life now he tells you over and over that you can't have eternal life and lose it right God is not an Indian giver right okay so what happened to Adam Adam never reached the eternal life that should have come into being had they not been that part of the fall we should have come forth and Adams body would have been laid eternal but now you tell me what's the difference now did not you receive eternal life in your soul what is it not that this body is coming to the place of redemption is that not what it hit see this man the man of 1 26 and 27 he never failed now just in case you want to go into some terminologies and try to run that computer a little bit 5 star for a minute let's put it on hold and think about it you say that well he just created Adam that was on the creation brother Branham says the 1:26 man was a man and he said not an EM a in and when they put it in the book they're supposed to put em period a period in period because that would have been runs it not a em a n he said immunity created man there was only one of them that man was Jesus Christ I thought we believed it over in genesis 3:15 he said I'll put the enmity between though I thought that was a promise for the first coming of Jesus Christ I thought Adam was standing there just exactly like Jesus Christ was when he came on her eternal in soul the body not eternal coolness out into Jesus coming up all right but to fall put man and everything to death okay spiritual man Jesus had no beginning in his soul his body was not eternal but his soul was eternal or else you're going to have to have another person and how to three times all right but God placed in flesh and what moved him over here where we can get the connection God stepped down in human flesh you become a part of us eternal life in his soul but his body was not eternal he had to give his life and when we're getting through see Calvary released the soul the disciples walking with Jesus heard the word and they went to Pentecost they're going to the next and you'll see that there's no line because it just mingles together see Pentecost Holy Ghost came in two disciples they become a new creation in Christ Jesus eternal a new creature doesn't mean a different creature in Paul saying the new creature in Christ Jesus it's not saying that he created a this is this man Jesus Christ made manifest I thought this holy ghost it was released at Calvary commended disciples who made our souls eternally I thought we had eternal life right now in our soul by the new birth weighting the redemption of the body waiting to a time that these bodies can take on immortality what do you see what I'm talking about then there was two creations this tape runs message you don't throw it away because you think you found a contradiction wait on God he'll answer it someone he'll bring it forward when he created life that was his first part over here because he was like and him was no darkness whatsoever so what he started to do God just started condescending downward whatever word can you knew stepping down in morphing himself from one form to another form as we come forth to be lower at theophany and then he began to speak and say let there be that's what I hope you'll see though that that man that was standing there saying let there be was that the army of Almighty God not the human place for Jesus Christ no wait now that's why read your scriptures and you think it don't mean nothing but read your scriptures when he said to him who demand say out of Son of Man a.m. he said thou art the Christ now what if Heda stopped her he defined who was standing there he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God what was Peters declaration what is the church built on that Jesus was all-mighty God in human flesh body of creation soul at no beginning spirit at no beginning put the soul and spirit into the body of Jesus and you got a man standing on earth what happened to Adam in the garden he put the number one man into the two you put Genesis 1 into Genesis 2 and what was that understanding a child of God the Bible calls him the only one it's in the old customer had him Bible called him a son of God I know we're with our when he looked down in and so the three standing them in her I've expressed that nicka desire who is it that but God looks down in and he said we throw it in during a forum dinner and he said one of them is like the son of God because he knew he could see it it had to have a form and he knew if it could walk in the fire it had to be God come on church the word is so perfect to just simply think about it that God in the beginning communism God in the beginning before anything he had a plan and a purpose in mind to let himself be expressed and as he was letting himself be expressed he stepped forth from one form to another he just keeps stepping forward until in the end time he's stepping forward now and what he really wanted you realized that Jesus went through a change you make his body eternal you realize that's what we're facing that's why Satan is fighting so hard he's fighting so hard in this last days because he's going to people to realize what's going on but I say around the world the Bride of Christ is beginning to realize who they are and they're here for a purpose we're here to make God manifest come on am i quoting the Bible or the prophets what I'm saying he's not to step on earth again we're to meet him in there well then who is he who are we where God made manifest on earth called a bride let's see if I can find out well they're getting ready so you gotta get fine to one when the message beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation watching flip between sons of God and angels said were was you when I laid the foundation of the world before elated when the sons of God sang together and the morning stars shouted for joy he's flipping the - what's he the morning star shouted for joy them shining ones shouted for joy when they seen that some day they would cover knuckle here on earth and the King Melchizedek would come in the righteousness of God and give his life to redeem us man mercy - oh the message identification it's displaying showing by top like the whole Bible remember across the mystery God revealed he said the whole Bible is a planning of a hobo God coming together with a redeemed wife a bride that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world he's coming forth in that way it's left over you and I to decide where we go or not those are free moral agency lists and oh we got our free moral agency it's to accept or reject and we're proving what we are well brother Dale I just can't understand you so I just I just don't work then and go somewhere that's you can understand somebody all right no problem and try to run nobody off if you can't understand the way I freeze and go somewhere where you can understand for heaven's sake don't go sat down in some of this junk and at least you'll have more respect with the Word of God tonight go ahead what are we can you want in red you might have a need the star along is still on the go to walk in the garden in Israel and sang that we would walk it down through there and we 26 over the Thunder we started singing everywhere we went the people begin to say y'all are the group that seems good every time we went to different place we sung a different song [Applause] but it was real just think about walking in the garden and seeing that [Music] what about the sounds of Solomon when they heard even to Russ thing good boy when they seen him looking through the lattice read that sometimes and get your experience involved in it where you can see what Christ is trying to do right now he won't entity tell CI before the foundation of the world [Music] so yeah but you're talking about pre-existence what I'm talking about eternal love eternal love it free existence [Music] [Applause] do you have eternal out and that eternal a pre-existing but not me and you at people why do we want to get these things involved why do we want to get these place in spirit the two things has got to be made eternal why do we want to try to make something out of that [Music] nothing but a garbage can [Music] father we thank you for today in afraid that what we said would be worthy of you Lord we try to dis not read so much today but just talk to the people and we ask you to help us to understand let us see who you are and what you're trying to do if you're trying to manifest yourself Lord to here among us in the life stage bring in to us eternal life because these old bodies is walking toward eternity father the Prophet is already explained it if we die you'll release the life and it will come but if we're still alive we're going to take where we are here and walk more toward you and to meet you in eternity we thank you we ask you to just bless us and guide us in Jesus name we dismiss and lurch off [Music] you [Music]
