in your scriptures turn to Matthew 24 Matthew 24 now remember the announcements that's been made the Lord willing this coming Sunday brother jeul fory will be with us preaching for the weekend and then remember that brother Ron Spencer will be here with us on the 29th and the 30th of this month preaching for us that'll be on Saturday and Sunday Saturday 7:00 Sunday at morning service but we won't be having an evening service now cuz we're going to have a dinner together and you know and all and the fellowship and also I talked with brother Spencer yesterday and he said that brother Fraser was back in the hospital and that he has got a bad blood clot and I thought he sitting down in the heart that's what I understood him to be saying that it was in his heart but he has a real bad blood clot so remember brother Homer Fraser in your prayers and just keep that you know that in your prayers cuz he's had a lot of trouble and things you know and just just remember that so remember this morning Matthew 24 our precious Lord and our savior Our Redeemer our all and all in Jesus is your name we thank you for that name thank you for the love and the grace that you've given unto us thank you for you we ask you now that you would just come Among Us and be with us today as we talk about you and Lord most of all forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness the things of Life of thoughts and ideas and all that would be totally contrary to you take them away from us father and wash Us in the water of the word Lord we love you and we ask you to just be with brother Fraser there Lord that you touch him and let that pass completely from him and all to be well because the little bride of Christ around the world she calls out for you Lord to come on the scene for our brother we ask you to just deliver him just have you way now in the service today you said you sent your word and healed us so as we talk about you come Among Us and heal the sick among us Deliver Us and guide us and keep us in Jesus name amen Matthew 24 now this will be reading we will just read over like to verse 14 but 1 through 14 and um now we're not on the seals or anything but this is the the reading of the seals you know the the seals was revealed what what has been what is and what will be is all revealed in the seal so that's that's the purpose of reading this today and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him to show him the building of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verely I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that that ye be not troubl for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet and Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places right all these are the beginning of Sorrow then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you must be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false Prophet shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come you may be seated you may be now verse six I want to pick out of that and it says and you shall hear a war wars and rumors of War see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet amen right amen so what we're going to talk about is what it's saying the said the seals cover the complete Plan of Redemption and we just got through uh speaking about that on this past uh Wednesday to talk about a complete Plan of Redemption and all and that's what we want to do here is to just take a thought from this and and the thought today will be out of that sixth verse it says must come to pass now I want you to just follow with me for a minute and then we'll get down to a real thought we as I said we we finished or we're coming down to the end of U kind of a series that we've been on and talking and and expressing what our thoughts has been of heaven and and uh things like that and bringing it down to earth and our journey and all like that and then we came over to to talk about just a few simple things that you know uh like whatever is we see in heaven what we've been talking about right to find would be in heaven and all like that then it also must come to Earth to be made manifest that's right we can read a lot about you know that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world that's wonderful but if that had not taken place upon Earth see some 2,000 years ago then it would make that a false prophecy right that you would be looking at see and that's that's the point that was my point Wednesday night was trying to get you to to look into the word and and to find our day in its message because I believe that's what you know the disciples uh they were looking I mean the the the the the ones that we took which would be all you know from job and we were bringing out how that the Morning Star s together and the sons of God shouting for Joy when they seen the Plan of Redemption all right now they seen all the way down because they didn't see just a partial thing of redemption they saw a completed Plan of Redemption which would mean for Body Spirit Soul world for everything amen so they were rejoicing so that was us there in the portion of eternal life amen that was in God before the world that as we were you know uh uh studying about that we were chosen in him so it was in Christ you know it wasn't little people running around little identities like that we were in Christ Jesus all right but see if then Now We're Here manifest upon Earth yes righten but as I made a statement coming to the end of the message that see we must uh I believe it's time to get away from looking back right to try to figure out what we were and to try to comprehend what we are now and if we can comprehend where we are now and see our day in its message we believe the message the prophet brought but see our day then we can realize realization about ourselves and and what's taking place in the end time because remember the whole point was every who that was was looking down here right amen all right looking right down here to where we're at in this day amen in this time to see the complete Plan of Redemption come into view that's right through the opening of the seals by the way of the Prophet messenger you know and then what we're waiting now is for God to make the those things manifest all right now if it's not made manifest then it would be false prophecy right that was the whole point I wanted you to get in other words it would be uh uh it would not be right it would be it's what a lot of people think the Bible is it's just what some man wrote you know what somebody just wrote that but I don't believe that right I believe it's the word of God I believe it was written before the foundation of the world but then it was just transmitted down y because it was what was in God's mind and transmitted down to mankind upon Earth to pin it down to where you and I could have it because see then you'd go back and the Bible was written in the stars y all right the Bible was written in the pyramids but then finally it was made into uh you know ink as we call it paper written down but really we are the living Bible amen right we are the word that's made manifest written Epistles made known of you know and and all but there's a time that it must come to manifestation right all right as one believer I believe in a manifestation of God I don't believe in just going to church and being good and say we're in the message and you know and that's that's been my desire ever since I've been in the message is to try to preach the word as I told you the Lord said one day he said you you preach it and I I'll back it up well I thought then well hey I'm I thought you know I'm doing the best I can do Lord but I've come to realized that you know that there was a whole lot more to be revealed than where we were at at that time so then you know that brings it to uh bring it on down to where we live recognizing your day message to see who we are see all right soever who that was and I say it that way because you know people don't like you say we was back there and and all like that cuz they get their minds tangled up into what were we yeah right who were we what was going on you know write it down where I can read it off of what I was yeah well you was in God right amen or you never will be in God you was a part of God the Eternal life you have today is the life of God correct right so then if it's the life of God then we're God made manifest in human flesh upon the Earth again in the end time and see there was a day you couldn't have said that right there was a day they were just about crucified you if you have said where God made manifest right and I ain't talking about back down through the a I'm talking about somewhere along about the 60s and 70s and ' 80s you know of coming forth into the message of the hour right that they just about crucify you and some probably would even yet for you to talk about that we're God made manifest but I believe that see because that new birth is that's what makes us God in human flesh all right so then every who it was back there was looking down here see because they seen the completed Plan of Redemption amen as I said if Jesus Christ hadn't died on the cross see then somewhere he would have to to make that scripture right or else was not the Scriptures it was not the Bible that should be sensible to us so then you know that's what we want to do we want to take that point and try to see our day and its message right all right now I'm talking about and I know bear with me for a second because you're not going to like this point maybe some but you know I'm talking about all over internets and everything but I I believe we're down here at the end now I sure hope that there's not a whole lot left right I'm just honest about that I just sure hope that there's not a lot left never been one about times or dates or Seasons but I have always been one wanted to be ready against the day you know of whatever and and I believe that I bringing out there the other day when I was asked the question do you believe we have the faith of the fathers I said yeah I do I believe we have it well I I just don't see it made manifest well right now there's where the trouble's at so I can't make it manifest you can't either right and see that's what people do that's right as the old saying goost don't judge my bushel of apples by your one rotten one that might not be exactly the quote but that's my way of quoting it but that's what people will do they won't have signs and wonders following them but yet you say something about the Bible and the truth and the message and we believe we should be the word made manifest then they start saying but I don't see no signs and wonders among you well I don't see them among you come on brother what did that change you know I can't make it manifest and you can't either that's right God is the only one that can make manifested work but now you and I are the ones that can hinder him making it manifest come on brother now that's where we want to get out of the way where he can make it manifest all right and I believe that's going to take reveal word to do that part for us but now here's the point I want you to get and we said about the seals being the complete Plan of Redemption all right to me the Bible as I brought out the other day this Bible was to us to a degree was open right sure to the basis that we could read it uh we could comprehend salvation Etc Y and that was done by mankind down through Y and then your Prophet came alone and it be to open further right on into the basis of understanding like we look at the pyramid call it the face of the fathers all right he began to preach that the one God the water baptism the no eternal hell it begin to open unto us by way of the Prophet down through his ministry all right don't throw away the old parts of the message you know and then say well we just take what's after the seals well I'll just tell you up front you can't understand what's after the seal if you don't see what was before because that before has got to be dealing with faith of the father that's right all right now but see then it didn't stop with just the faith of the fathers right then the seals were broke off the book right and when the seals were take off taken off the book then it became an open book amen that's right it wasn't fully open down through time no it was waiting for the prophet to come to bring the message and for God to come on the scene and take off the seals off the book right all right now that that we all understand that cuz then the the seals then would be the complete Plan of Redemption that's right for man world everything you know would be revealed in the seals and that Prophet brought it to us and that's why I read this depart there from Matthew 24 cuz I wanted to just read that one part where it says you know must come to pass as the thought that came to me but I want you to see that the Bible is now open I didn't say we understand all of it right right it was open to the prophet it was open to us in a degree of a lot of things coming down through time but that didn't mean we understood it all that don't mean I understand it all now right cuz I believe that there's a message to cheer down to the endless ages the prophet said after we leave here all right so then don't worry about it but let's get down and get away from back there right that's right all right now I wrote my own a note where I remember this part get away from back there but don't look at that that way right right what's back there is fine and what's coming is fine mhm but let's stay with what is here because now listen if God revealed something to you for that out there all right that's fine okay that's wonderful was listening to way last night when he preached out there and wiard T really enjoyed it and he was talking about how that David was anointed to be king well you know there was nothing could ever happen to him until he sat on the throne now he might not have been on the throne but one minute still he was going to be on that throne because that the prophet had anointed him for that job well why can't we believe that somebody in this in time somebody is ordained to stand here and these bodies be changed all right then why can't we believe we're part of it why can't we just accept it and say well there's not more to come I I don't say now there's more word to come all through the n but I'm talking about we're not looking for another Prophet to come we're not looking for something else to happen we're not looking even for somebody to come along and be able to correct the profit that we had right that's what they're all trying to do now you know but y we're not looking for that we're looking at it right now amen what's being behind us can be Faith Builders right cuz that's what David said he said I killed the lion I killed the buyer and you'll be just like that see it the same God it was there would be with him but he lived in a world of present tense right now what if he said now the bar and the line that would have been good faith I think I can take on Goliath you know I believe maybe I can whip it let me go try anyway let's don't be a bunch of shiftless bums out here you know just running around everything let me at least stand up you know and and be and and go forth no see he seen the future whatever was the past he seen the future that's fine right but you know what he had to do he had to back up into the present temp's time right and he had to go face Goliath right right and believe it all right see let's let's just deal with where we at now yes see get away from back there get away from for the future deal with what we're doing right now all right see then what we're looking at is the Bible as we read here said it must come to pass right all right must come to pass now in God there is no such thing as saying something without it being his word he's not like you and me he's not something that we can talk about something and maybe not be able to do it because of of things happening or events in place and you know that's why the Bible said the Bible don't say well tell brother colie you see him tomorrow it said it says the Lord willing the Lord willing because see you you you can't determine that something can go wrong but in God there's no such thing amen right now that's what you I want you to keep your mind on today is the Bible must come to pass amen all right now as I said about what was back down if it doesn't come to pass it would mean that was not written correctly right right all right now the things that we're looking forward to happen they must come to pass or what was written is not true now watch and our testimony right yeah now come on our test testimony yep of what we're saying present tense you know Christ is alive in us we believe the word see then that would mean that would be false prophecy right right see as well as the written right so now it's all hinged on you and I right this whole thing is hinged on whether or not don't worry about whether there's going to be 144,000 boy I'm glad we got that figured out I am too to hear about it but I'm not worried about them that's right I'm not worried about the future I'm concerned with right now because there won't be a future if there's not a now right that's right and if we can't take it here and say here it is right and that's what I kept trying to say about healings and everything you got to confess it to be you got to confess your salvation somebody's going to have to confess to be to stand here in human bodies that are getting older and and you know more deteriorating and everything but yet say y there's a change in the moment TN amen the Bible said it amen all right that's what I want us to look at look at it in a positive attitude that no matter what we see right like what said one time we talking about Abraham he said talking about Abraham and and what he done is fine but if we don't talk about God today right of Abraham that's right then we might not have the god of Abraham right we might be just blabbering our mouths about something but I believe that we're here at the end time how much time is left who worries we're not concerned about time we're Eternal creatures right amen Eternal creatures don't worry about time elements right I it's over in Jamaica and you've heard us tell about you know we went over there and you know first time I was when brother Harris went together you know and he had been over there but I hadn't but we got over there and we were going to do something the next morning I said brother Harris We'll be up early in the morning you know we we'll be on the road we got to take some material and do some things okay so quick as light come you know man I I got up I got ready brother haris got up and got ready it was about 6:00 you know we sitting on the porch well about 9:00 sister Brady come through I'll fix you some coffee he said breakfast be ready at a while well about 10:00 we ate breakfast I mean all it felt well and good but I was thinking we was going to be going in a hurry you know and all like that but they're just kind of slow so we were going to um when I preached over in Kingston and we were heading over there I looked at my watch you know and I thought well we're we're running pretty good on time for what time they said the service started and we we look and brother Reed said we got to eat eat and there was a happened to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken or a McDonald's or something and he said we got to eat something I thought it's time for service he said oh that's all right they'll be singing so we will in we go in just just just casual just eating not no big hurry you know I mean I keep licking up with watch I why brother he said brother Dale he said you don't understand that's black folks he said we're never on time he said we're slow you know what he's right we got over there they're singing you know what hour later they're still singing well I begin to get to kind of the idea the next morning I didn't jump up as early you know and everything that's right but what I'm talking about life right life and not worried about the future not worrying about the past right see if we were more like that we wouldn't be having heart attacks and you know and ERS and and all kind of things is woring us you know we wouldn't be doing that but I still can't do it I still you know I'm still concerned you tell me to wake you up at 2:00 and I'll wake you up at 2:00 I don't have to set the clock to do that I just wake you up but still it's just you know maybe we need to slow down maybe we need to learn some things anyhow amen but what I'm trying to do is to get us today to see ourselves okay that's right amen now to see what brother random was was wonderful that's right to see what the Saints has done behind us is wonderful to look to forward to other things is wonderful but what about what we are and what we're doing now that's right that's it where at cuz you see that's the point I want you to get see it must come to pass if God said something I heard a man one time on tape and he said me and Bill was talking about some scriptures that would never come to pass I'm not going to argue with you brother but the man that you say y'all were talking about it says that all scripture must be fulfilled so you evidently misunderstood him somewhere you know I'm not going to call you a lie just say you misunderstood what he said about something but see I believe every scripture must be fulfilled that's right amen but now here's the point if you don't get nothing out of the message as I said about David his his faith was buil in he killed the V he killed the line all right now my faith today is building the journey that God has allowed me to follow the time that I've been here I enjoyed being in the Baptist I found no problem sure I never jumped up and run out of there are you a bunch of lost demons going to hell and everything no I got up and told him I just couldn't agree with him on the word and I walked out but you see I've enjoyed the journey that I've been on Amen right and and and everything and done a lot of studying about what we was and what we will be and what we're already now and that's great but I want to see the god of now come on the scene you and I right and that's our hindrance is we're stopping ourselves we we're we're keeping God from being able to fulfill his word right now so then we need to search ourselves and see what's going on and study the Bible now I wrote it like this we need to stop looking and spending our time at looking to see what we was before the world and not trying to worry about what we will be in the future right amen but to see what's taking place amen right now when job saw the morning stars singing together and the sons of God shouting for Joy see somewhere that must come to pass right amen all right now all this behind you're following me see that must come to pass if God says anything it has to come to pass amen cuz if not it wouldn't be what God Said it' be what we thought he said or what you know we thought somebody else said about it brother Joe let's get a little reading out of the way and then we'll you see you shouldn't have to have these I really didn't have these they look so down and out that I wouldn't going to let them do their job today so I went in I knew what quotes and everything so I just ran them off and let let them have them but look what look what the prophet of God had to say about it this is from a message called pardon that's preached in 1963 uh 1028 paragraph 43 then we can rely upon this whatever God says is true it must come to pass God cannot take his word back see because he's infinite and he's Eternal and his first decision is alltime decision he doesn't have to to take it back because he learned more about it he's infinite to begin with and therefore When God says anything it's perfectly that way it can never be changed because because it's the perfect decision that's right now whatever God that's the point look at the next one modern events made by prophecy paragraph 5765 1206 and this book is the book of Prophecy it's Believers are commanded to honor it and to read it and believe its author forever word that's written in there must come to pass everything that's been promised to come to pass because it's Jesus Christ in each day the same yesterday so he goes on talking about knowing Jesus in different on all right look at the last one we'll get he reading out of the way which is page 49 Church age book The patmas Vision says you telling John write the Visions John make a record of them for the Ages which are to follow for they are the true prophecies and must come to pass write them and send them out making them known now we've got the profit behind what we're talking about and we not have to have that to be said but we've got it there to honor that heart that what the Bible says is true amen and if we would read it that way and not read it as about somebody else amen but read it as about ourselves that's right how are we supposed to read it by his stripes Samuel Dale is healed make it something personal he was wounded for my put my name there make it personal because it is written to me as I always say this is my Bible was GI to me but it's my Bible right it belongs to me the letters on the page then would belong to me right amen all right then the god of the or the author of The Bible would be speaking to me that's right about me that's right see that's what we're failing to see in the Bible we read it about somebody else and then we say we wish that God would be here as he was in Paul right as he was in Peter see and in doing those things and and and I've always been the one that always destroys everybody's bubble but it's like I've always said you take the life of Paul and you think boy it would have been wonderful to live in that world like he did what kind of a world did that man live in to be what he was right sure you know John was on Patman for two years out there with snakes and alligators I mean snakes I'm sure for two years right wri in the Book of Revelation boy it be something to write the Book of Revelation but what about the horror that he went through look at Paul what did he say beaten uh how many times I forgot five times or something shipwreck all kind of things happen to the man right over his writing in the Bible it wasn't all Glory Hallelujah that's right amen right right look at our Prophet here in the end time and all the things that happened to him amen of losing his wife and losing his daughter because he wouldn't step out right on the word of God right come on he wouldn't deny his gifts and all this that and the other right he just wouldn't move when God told him to Y and God had to remove things out of his way to where he could be out on the field right he had to wait until his mother-in-law pass cuz he promised his wife you know he said now we leave now what about a promise of God waiting on the death of your mother-in-law right it's true God's up in heaven waiting when his mother-in-law FES he'll get up and go I mean I'm just being honest right right see but what I want us to think about don't worry about these things just read the Bible and see what the Bible says about it there's a lot in the Bible you know what about the scripture this is just the way I write down things but what about the scripture says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect right now that means somebody's got to do that right right now we can argue over how to get TI CU that's what we've done for all the years right the Baptist had their interpretation of that me just that there presbyter well this really wouldn't meaning perfect it was meaning this or it didn't mean this it meant that then we argued over what it meant instead of realizing that it was true amen so somebody has to be perfect why cu the Bible says and just as perfect as her father is right so why don't I believe that that's me why can't I accept that that's me the prophet of God made a lot of things of the Bible come into a reality of taking the Bible and bringing it but what about when he would speak about say that in the end time there'd be a bride y they would not fall like e right amen now what about that right you know what that means somebody has got to fulfill that or else it's false prophecy are you following me the things brother brand said about you and I and who we are and what we are if somebody don't make that manifest then he was wrong and if he was wrong the Bible would be wrong so now you know I'm not believing that he was wrong not believing the Bible was wrong right wrong is you and I Amen to not accept what God says right right by being in Jesus Christ by the new birth we're just as perfect as God is amen amen that's right why because God's living in us right but do we really believe that that's it there's a lot of things in the Bible that see points down to where we are and we studied a lot in the book of Revel I mean they're talking about the Heaven and the and the you know in the things and we found out one day there's going to be a future home that's going to come down out of the sky land on this Earth well you know if that don't take place then that means the Bible's wrong right you follow me right why not set our goal now we not set our goal to be one thing when we reach the moon you've heard me Express this when man reached the Moon you know the interplanetary travels Etc he kind of reached an apex remember what you call in a height and there's not a lot of development now there's a lot of scientific advances don't misunderstand me but yet the surge for to get dark we had to beat the Russians we had to beat them we had to beat our first we had to do this so it made a push to to go forward but now it's just kind of oh we got a rocket up there you got a rocket up there watch out for my rocket is coming by you know we'll help you fix yours you help us fix ours you know we just all go up together and work on these things even though we are our enemies wanting to destroy each other but yet we still got some Russians and and Americans probably up up there right now that's working on scientific achievements but you see the people have no gold anymore we were talking the other day about kids and what's doing see and looking at where it's at and you just see them you just see the kids they just out there they don't care they don't care about a job all they care about is a dollar to be able to buy them some dope or you know something to eat and every one of them you know you can see that they don't eat because you hardly ever see I'm talking about you know I'm not talking about going to school seeing all the fat ones now misunderstand me you go on I'm talking about that you see these that are out on the streets and they're all real skinny because they don't eat yeah cuz they don't care that's right they're just living day today just have a good time why cuz there's nothing to be achieved anymore right right but now why can't we as the PR of Jesus Christ set a goal you know go a goal in our mind a plan in their mind a way yep to say I'm going to do this right I'm going to achieve this it says that somebody will right right why not me be the one Abraham Lincoln learned to read the Bible and that he had what foxy book of Martyrs and had the Bible I believe is the two books he had and he taught his own self to read turn not to be president of the United States yeah right but you see because he said in his mind that's it that he was going to achieve that's right I was over in Jamaica and they didn't like it at all I know it cuz you see a lot of it over there they hear this they understand it's true a lot of that is just down because they don't have anything to go and do and just eating and scrunching for the best they can and I told the church people there I talk there just like I talk here I don't change when I'm anywh there I said your problem is is you're lazy you go out and get you a job well we don't have no jobs over here create one move this rock over there and then put it back over here you can find something to do right here in America you know that's ain't no job what it means is it ain't no job going to let you work from going at what go to work at 12:00 and off at 1 then you want two coffee breaks in the middle it's becoming this shiftless lazy bums that's I don't like that I'm just honest it doesn't matter me what countryes in if somebody's got a can fill out there that's what I telling them get you a job cutting I ain't cutting can see you're lazy all right but see set let's set a goal in our mind a thought in our head amen is nothing else because I believe that God's word is here amen amen and I believe we need to start saying it's here get away from this well one of these days you know one these days one these days it's going to happen no why not say today is the day of salvation walk into it say that we're changed walk into it say we're healed walk into it say we're saved walk into it amen cuz the Bible says these things must come to pass amen see the Bible must be fulfilled that's right right yes sir I hope you're listening to the point of what I'm trying to make see it must be fulfilled it's not something that we talk about we're not supposed to be messages Baptist I'm not throwing off on them right but you know how it is we're all going to heaven we're all we all we're good yeah there little group over here they got their and we got we we well now now we're not going to have different groups when we get to heaven that's right you we that's what they say now yeah but we're you know that used to be we're going to have it used to be that everybody T we're going to have a Baptist Corner Methodist Corner Presbyterian Corner whatever but see now they don't say that because they moved into other Realms and talks and they say well now you just talk to somebody and they'll say well there's not going to be them them little groups in heaven we're going to all be one we get there you know well they change you know why cuz somebody come along to tell them I told you how that the the water baptism came to me I had to go get it done when that Baptist preacher preached all you do in word and deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ the church started praying in Jesus Christ if you ever in a Baptist Church back in the older days when we was there 40 years ago you prayed for Christ's sake in his name the name of the Lord come on I there lifted and watched them but after that man preached that they started praying in Jesus name but see I went to the water of baptism amen y well you know what they're doing today you go there and you listen they pray in Jesus name because somebody opened up a can of a position to them that would would bring them into a different thought of Life why don't we just sit in our mind and think about the Bible if it was written it must come to pass amen if we can find it written it must come to pass right the prophet of God I was looking for this in the other day and there's a little different wording in it but it's our he said if you can find the promise in God's word and he don't rank the pass you can call him a liar right I remember when I first heard that I thought boy that's strong but didn't I realize what he was saying that's right amen there thing I have has to be based upon what this Bible say right that's right you say I'm based on the prophet well you can't do it by one that's right now he said right the front side and the rear side of the gun y he wasn't using Old and New Testament to just Express that he was using the message right and the Bible to line you up on target right cuz either one of them messed up and You' missed it right right man but he come to show God came to and used the prophet to vindicate that this Bible is right or what it say he said we don't need nobody to interpret it to us brother brandham that's what people say and I've said it too and it's it's true to what you're thinking if you get it right brother brand come to bring us the interpretation of the Bible that's all right right but you know really he didn't come to bring us the bring us an interpretation he come to tell us what the interpretation was you said when it said back there in Genesis and there was light he said there was light he said there's your Vindication or manifestation well why can't we just study it to the point to say this must come to pass God gives you a promise it must come to pass does he ever give you a promise about something and then you seen it come to pass have you you ever done that I mean him just really tell you something and then you see it come to back you know what there ain't enough devils in hell to keep that from taking place I don't care how many they are are devils or preachers either there ain't enough of them to keep it from coming to pass when I first came into this message it was always the preachers that preached you don't have to understand the message you just believe what the prophet said you don't have to have no understanding you don't need to do it and if there's anything changes we'll tell you where it changes oh my uhhuh so now what are they doing they're telling you we're changes cuz they got the two Souls of s00 Virtues Bru is River Jordan they got the Telly where all the changes come right you know but see I wonder what brother random would do if he back here everybody said brother's coming back if it took him 3 32 years to preach statute of perfect man I believe that's right the number wise of it 30 something years how long would it take him to preach it over again to get it right that's what I've always said I've always told you what I believe about these things but I stand on what God has spoken to me yes see these things must come to pass that's right if God tell you something don't worry about it that's right I told my wife something one time you've heard me say it I was sitting up in the garden I never told what it was cuz I told her I said that'll take place she said no it won't I said it'll take place or I'll quit preaching won't preach another seron and but I meant every word of it she said well you preached your last mes because she didn't believe it take life well it did yeah I've told you many things here and said stood right here from the pull pit and said I'm basing that upon my own right you know what God spoke to me about it said you'll rain when we call for it I've also told you it won't rain until I call for it see that's all on tape I don't have to worry about it that's people out there you know they they're playing around and they got these preachers that come through and say I said this and I said that but how many of them got the tapes from 82 to where we stand today to back it up and even some earlier than that but listen Church these things must come to pass that's my whole point of bringing this about heaven and seeing how it is and wants to take place but now we're down here where these things must take place here y That's Right Heaven Don't Need No Redemption no that's right right I don't get all into other with the reconciliation cuz that that's carrying you back to reveal work righten Heaven don't need Redemption is you and I that need Redemption right amen when job said the morning star sign together the sons of God shouted for joy and the prophet said that was when they saw the Plan of Redemption they were looking down here right right amen told you that time nobody been lost right looking down here to where we would be on earth and rejoicing about it you ever just get happy and rejoice about God saving you amen right do you ever just wonder why he saved you amen when all the rest of the world was so much whole lot better than we are we and are yeah why did he save us right why did he choose us but look what about all of the scriptures that we could go through I just wrote down thing and I'd write down and then WR must come to pass must come to pass must come to pass the Bible said he'd open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing upon you that you'd not be able to contain y right you know I've seen that come to pass I'm seeing it come to pass and I'm looking forward to it coming to pass right amen that's right aren't you right I used to go out and preach and I'd never take no money we were down in Augusta one time I know you've heard this one we were down in Augusta one time and brother gave me some money I don't I would he never look at it didn't matter to me if it been a million dollars I didn't care and you tell you you don't mean that well I've give away that much so I ain't worri about it right but I got through preaching the brother gave me money and I just put it back in his pocket come out to my wife and was fixing the head home I said honey I hope you got some money kids is hungry but I get them a bite to eat on the way home she said I don't have dime I said well I don't have anything either turned around and started to leave the man walked up to me and shook my hand there was enough money in there to pay for the food I didn't go around and tell everybody you know that's what preachers do preachers will do these you know and this is way they do well I've just checked over and I really don't have no money to buy anything to eat brother and you know I know hard times and all for you I I just don't have anything the coral kids going to be hungry you you got kids you know how hungry they'll get now that's the way they do so they sell out the money I didn't tell nobody nothing that man just walked up and handed money and walked off I really don't even know who it was but you see he'll pour out the windows of Heaven amen you're looking at old boy that come from them people out on the internet don't never seen it maybe but an old boy that's 71 years old that used to plow mu all day long 7 years old I didn't have no extra par shoes we had one power a year and that it if you wore them out you walked around without with holes in they took my brother they took my Daddy's Shoes cut the end of the shoes off and nailed them back down with the old iron lash that I've got for him to wear a school and and my sisters at all life they hear him come down the hall cuz all he had was heels I'm not rich today but I'll take every one of you out to eat CU of what God's giv me right he's opened the windows of heaven right to pour out a blessing amen that you can't even contain that's right go out I've done it I went out and give out everything I had go home and didn't know nobody owed me nothing or go to the mailbox and somebody send some money it's just our right see we're the Most Blessed people you ever thought in your life amen that's right I'm not worried about what what we talking another day about that steak you know I don't know was there somewhere you I've never been in there think I can't afford it I just don't know how to eat when I get so many places I don't know how to order and if I ordered it I wouldn't know which Fork to use just honest but see you're seeing somebody that com to that where you got a nice home a good car sure it's not a brand new one but it's good gets me where I'm going right see God promised he'd do those things amen we spend a lot of our time looking at the promises in the Bible that there would be earthquakes in diverse places and we're seeing them today you know earthquakes and and things taking place that this outstanding you know but they must come to P cuz God said he would right all right the Bible then telling us and see the prophet didn't as I said have to come and interpret that he come to tell us that that was right right see he didn't change the Bible where that in verse three of what we read in Matthew in Matthew 24 there was three questions asked right we just didn't read it correctly right yep and that's three questions yep see he come to show us those things he come to tell us the Bible says there's just one God Amen right well you know the Bible already sat that but we got in our self interpretation and got it so out of line until it could not be fulfilled the way we see things right but the way God says it it must come to pass right amen see those Towers had to fall to fulfill the scripture right but the towers would fall but yeah we can look at The Towers falling but do we do we understand and follow after that in that day the light of the sun will be seven times and the bride the moon would be as the same as the sun am that's the things that we don't follow after by seeing ourselveses and saying you there is per things in the Bible yep one day there will be a change in a moment the twinkle of an eye that must come to pass because it has been written right right but it'll only come to pass when somebody right stands here right and says it right cuz it must come to pass let me say it right this message was not brought to be argued over our doct doctrinal issues or situations this message was to be to bring forth a stature of a perfect man amen and the Bible says it will come amen and it must come but then our choice is whether or not we'll accept it and believe it like I've always said I told you 30 years ago or more I said there'll be a lot of people in this message will die because they will not be able to stand here and take a change of the body so thereby they are Christians Born Again people they can't climb the statue of a perfect man that's what I saw 30 years ago or more and I haven't changed when IA since then on that point that's right you see a lot of young people in the message you see a lot of old people sure you say well old is supposed to die you see a lot of young people dying in this message I'm not de christianizing anybody right I wasn't n then my point never was to De Christian my point is I said then I may be one of them that won't be able to take that change in know word I've got to go by the grave I have no other choice the Bible says that that's right see the Bible says we've got to come like Richard said about said he'd never seen that brother random said we've got to have the stature of a perfect man y right we've got to have it it's not something that that's we talk about it's a requirement somebody's going to be changed to do that we're going to have to walk in the Statue of perfect man right and to see those things when are we going to start saying it though right must come to pass it must it it it's not a it's not a thought it's not an idea it's What God Says amen that's right now all I spent about up in heaven was to be able to say this message today all I talked about when we were talking about in heaven about 6 minutes of what we would see and what would take place and and the things now this afternoon we're going to take the things we miss because of who we are but you see this must come to pass right because God said it well if God just told me like it did Abraham PR come on he if God was just me like with me like he was brother Brandon come on brother you wouldn't want to walk in his shoes that's right amen for one day let alone a year or two that's right any true preacher of God you wouldn't want to walk in my te no that's right because sometimes they're pretty hard sometimes it's pretty rough but I've never regretted it and I've always enjoyed it that's right am because the one goal I've got in mind is get you to see this Bible the prophet's message that we were reading must come to pass it's not whether it will or not or hoping it will well I hope that's a good thought you bringing there I just I just hope it'll be no there's no such thing it must come to pass right why because God said it right and if he doesn't keep his word on one place how can I expect him to keep it in another right if you can prove that God didn't keep his word in one place how do you know whether or not he keep it any words else right you know what I like I like things like brother R say that that was Moses and Moses he said I could understand Moses how he can tell God a better way of doing something he said I come find out it was Christ in and Moses right cuz I remember the Bible back there and I used to think about it I'm talking about I used to think about it well back right the Baptist and thing you know that Moses come up there and he actually went before God and he said now Lord I'm just kind of paraphrasing it you read he said Lord he said we're out here with problems we got troubles we're we're heading to the land and all these things is in the way and said Lord you come on the scene and take care of these things or else it will be said yeah that's pretty close to paraphrase right or else it will be said that God was able to bring them out so far but not able to take them in I thought then when I heard that Prophet say that that was Christ I thought oh Lord now I see it right right but you know that man was dealing with God yeah sure you know the Bible says who is it is it Isaiah or is Elijah which one that was praying for the people or you know all of those prophets prayed for the people of their time amen you know what God heard your words you mean you tell God watch and listen if you don't if you don't take these people into the land it's going to be said that you couldn't do it y God didn't say I'm mad at him I'm upset cuz he he's doubting me he said you're right and I'm going to do it y That's right yep Moses you're going to take them in right he took them as far as he could go didn't he but you know the same Christ that was in Moses to tell God A Better Way was right over in Joshua that's right to take them in right Joshua was the man I used to love to read that I thought where did this guy Joshua when day I was thinking about where this guy Joshua come from and I begin to kind of run a study on Joshua com find out he was right there with Moses get back there and read it sometimes and just read Joshua and his doing you got to get you know what I mean you you you got the Kings and you got the uh the Chronicles and the things that you got to read different accounts and some of them will explain more and I was thinking you know you come find out Joshua was standing right there side of Moses sure and when it come to the Tabernacle or what it was the congregation and what the thing was Joshua was told you go in there go you come out it wasn't a tent and doing a different thing you know it was a Joshua's job was to stay right there he was watching Moses being trained yep then one day God said as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee right he said okay I seen it work with God so it got to work again cuz he believe what God said that's right you understand come must come to pass I hope you get my point you see up in heaven you'll see that I I haven't finished my talk but just too much time you see something up in heaven that's got to happen here right right y you say I was back there well then we got to be right here right m true now if my life back there will showing one thing and my life here show something else right where am I right something's wrong right somebody's wrong somewhere right but if I could see myself years ago see preached that matching pieces when God seen that come across there and seen that angel sweep across and preach the message you to just you live by faith they had to be man on earth right and there was a man named Martin Luther that would take that message right he recognized his day and his message because God seen it come across well he's seen it come across that's why I like Christ M of God reveal brother said see how it's unfolded down to the present hour that we're living I love that go look how much further it's unfolded that's right amen it's unfolded now from being a prophet that it came to a bride is to take that message and walk off this Earth in the same message the prophet brought how much more honor could we give to brother brandham oh I want to honor I know people and I'm not so come on folks now I've been around and he listen to a lot of people you know the prophet said if we'd honor his family oh I want to do everything I can good for his family well that's fine that's fine but what about doing something for the Living God that's living now amen right y be a little blunt lot of people send their ties up to Jeffersonville Indiana because they want to do that that's their money ain't nothing business to me I don't care cuz they going to get me one more dime might cost me some but they want to send their money up to Jeffersonville but what greater honor could you give a prophet than to pay your tith to to a five-fold Ministry minister to fulfill the Bible that's right you can't send it there to fulfill the Bible that's right now come on you know I'm not a money man and been after it so that's that's right I'll just give it away anyway so that's no problem true it's like sister Gail said one time about she said brother Dale said God gave you a bunch of people that made good money and I do thank God for you because he knew he was going to give it away that's right it may come a time we can't do it but that's it's all right right we do what we can that's right who 214 INSP power 214 anybody have a need remember
