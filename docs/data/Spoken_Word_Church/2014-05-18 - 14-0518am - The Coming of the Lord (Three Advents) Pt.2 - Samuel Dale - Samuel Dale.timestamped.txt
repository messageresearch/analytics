[1:40] good to see you about in the house the
[1:42] Lord

[1:45] back where we've been reading from

[1:53] along
[1:55] no matter what we've been speaking on
[1:56] but we want to
[1:58] that we really enjoyed Services last

[2:25] done to make everything possible
[2:28] for us to be able to Fellowship together

[2:35] eat together today because we have a lot
[2:38] of food left over we didn't have as many
[2:40] people as was anticipated but we always
[2:43] have a whole lot left over so it's
[2:45] always nice to to be able to depend on
[2:48] that and and we pray that everybody will

[3:16] um there's many missing this morning
[3:18] Wade in June is in Miami and I talked to
[3:22] him a while ago and he said to remember
[3:25] his voice because he was already getting
[3:27] kind of croaky like and he's got two
[3:29] services to do today so you know he's
[3:32] finding out what it is to put five
[3:34] services or something in a row it gets
[3:37] rough on the old voice sometimes but
[3:39] remember him in the Lord willing they're
[3:40] flying back in tomorrow and I think
[3:43] Brother Joseph is flying back in in the
[3:45] next day or two from California and

[4:26] have any feeling there so they're
[4:28] putting her through and going to put her
[4:30] through therapy and things so just

[4:46] baby has an infection that an
[4:48] antibiotics don't work they're going to

[5:45] and touch it that father that it would
[5:47] not have to have an operation for the
[5:49] infections and the things because we

[5:53] but we believe your word We Believe by
[5:56] your stripes the little one is healed so
[5:59] we thank you for it we love you and we
[6:01] thank you we just pray that you'd have
[6:03] your way this day in each one of our
[6:05] hearts and lives in Jesus name
[6:07] amen
[6:09] first Thessalonians 4.
[6:13] probably two odd scriptures for you to
[6:16] think about reading together
[6:19] because one is like speaking of the
[6:21] rapture
[6:23] called away the other speaking of his
[6:25] coming
[6:26] so that sounds like two odd things to be
[6:30] preaching or reading to scriptures to be
[6:34] able to talk on these things but think
[6:36] about what it says now first
[6:38] Thessalonians 4 15.
[6:40] for this we say unto you by the word of
[6:42] the Lord that we which are alive and
[6:44] remain unto
[6:45] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[6:48] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[6:50] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[6:52] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[6:54] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[6:56] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[6:59] then we which were alive and remain
[7:01] shall be caught up together with them in
[7:03] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[7:06] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[7:10] now
[7:11] seems like a total going away doesn't it
[7:14] all right
[7:16] and first John
[7:18] you read the whole part of the seven the
[7:21] second chapter but
[7:23] to read the 28th verse now little
[7:25] children abide in him
[7:28] that when he shall appear we may have
[7:30] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[7:34] at his
[7:36] coming that's something you may be
[7:39] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[7:41] reading of the word
[7:46] now to
[7:48] not spend much time in the background
[7:50] but to make sure
[7:53] that you follow
[7:54] what we're doing and all we're talking
[7:57] about the coming of the Lord
[8:00] all right and uh
[8:02] in doing that
[8:05] then
[8:06] it's odd to read scriptures that
[8:10] uh talk about rapture
[8:13] and then you talk about the coming
[8:16] of the Lord but
[8:19] I believe if we'll get it in the right
[8:21] understanding that we'll be able to
[8:24] comprehend
[8:25] uh what is being done
[8:27] and all because I've told you before
[8:30] probably 20 years ago maybe
[8:33] uh I said I I'm I'm not trying to go to
[8:37] heaven
[8:39] I'm not wanting you to go to heaven
[8:43] because the prophet the way he covered
[8:46] it one day he says that
[8:49] and he gave this statement he said
[8:52] when the silence in heaven now we know
[8:54] it goes into the seals goes into all
[8:56] things but I mean I'm quoting what he
[8:58] said
[9:00] he said the reason is silence in heaven
[9:02] he said there won't be anybody up there
[9:07] that's an odd statement isn't it
[9:10] you know
[9:11] why would we want to go up there if
[9:13] there's nobody up there
[9:16] and I know our human minds and our our
[9:19] thinking
[9:20] you know is rapture
[9:24] oh we're smart now we've done found out
[9:26] that there's no such thing as the word
[9:27] rapture in the Bible
[9:29] it's caught up well that's good
[9:32] that's a good understanding
[9:35] but now uh
[9:37] think about
[9:39] the things that
[9:42] we've covered
[9:45] and remember
[9:46] that
[9:50] the Lord himself shall descend from
[9:51] heaven with a shout voices for an
[9:53] archangel trumpet and brother Brown says
[9:55] he does all three
[9:58] Jesus does all three
[10:00] in the Rapture message in his descending
[10:06] well
[10:08] I know I'm carnal and I'm sorry
[10:12] uh brother Aaron would you come up to us
[10:14] a little our fan on WE we've Cut You
[10:17] Down to 71. everybody thinks it's so hot
[10:20] in here today it still ain't 71 yet
[10:23] all right because it was yeah it'd be
[10:25] turning on
[10:26] but maybe we need a fan to get a
[10:28] stirring a little bit of doing
[10:31] but
[10:33] we looking we look as human beings
[10:35] because what we've been taught the Lord
[10:37] will descend from heaven of the shower
[10:38] Oh Glory how you're great
[10:41] you know the trumpet you know on voice
[10:43] on Archangel big Angel steps down out of
[10:45] the sky and raises the dead and then we
[10:48] hear this
[10:50] you know a trumpet
[10:53] well we've got away from that
[10:57] huh
[10:59] I mean we've upgraded
[11:02] we've got away from the Hat
[11:05] we don't believe that carnality anymore
[11:08] what do you believe
[11:14] we really don't know what we believe
[11:19] you know
[11:22] but you see we found that the Shout
[11:28] was the message
[11:31] all right
[11:33] so that means that part of the rapture
[11:38] has already taken place
[11:43] because the shouts already come the
[11:45] message we believe brother Wright's
[11:47] message was the chapter
[11:49] what are you looking for some hollering
[11:52] screaming
[11:56] see even in the second part our phase is
[12:00] we'll get into it in a little bit
[12:05] see when you're talking about the coming
[12:07] of the Lord you're talking about a vast
[12:10] amount of information or happenings
[12:17] you've got
[12:19] we'll cover in a minute we've been over
[12:21] it
[12:24] that uh
[12:25] bride
[12:27] is what you're dealing with
[12:29] and he come one time to redeem second
[12:32] time he comes to
[12:34] catch his bride away the third time he
[12:37] comes with his bride now that's in his
[12:38] coming
[12:40] then you got to coming to Israel
[12:47] then you got to coming to the world
[12:51] then you got to coming to the millennium
[12:55] will cause consummate or whatever what
[12:57] you want to call a big word end up with
[12:59] the coming of the Lord
[13:03] so there's many many things to be
[13:05] covered about his coming
[13:07] we don't know what you mean
[13:09] brother you're just so this well all
[13:13] right
[13:15] but I made this statement many times
[13:20] the prophet said
[13:23] being in the wrong ranks it's a rapture
[13:27] would be no excuse
[13:29] do you need that quote
[13:33] being in the wrong Reigns at the Rapture
[13:36] be no excuse
[13:38] well you know what's wrong ranks you
[13:40] military Brothers understand it
[13:44] it's not a whole step out
[13:47] because your whole step out you're in
[13:49] Step you're just one step behind but
[13:51] you're still up two three four right
[13:55] to be out of step is to be a high for
[13:58] step
[13:59] when they're going down you're going up
[14:01] you know
[14:04] well
[14:05] that's what would show up in a great big
[14:09] parade
[14:12] we'll see
[14:13] in the wrong ranks
[14:16] now I've never preached that you've got
[14:18] to be in Lulu so don't get the garbage
[14:20] can in your mind
[14:24] to me being in the wrong ranks is
[14:27] like I've always said you you're
[14:29] supposed to take a train ride today and
[14:32] and you know you you go down to the bus
[14:34] depot
[14:36] to get you a ticket
[14:38] to ride the train
[14:40] now that might have been 30 years ago 40
[14:43] years ago that that was taking place
[14:45] because the Bus Depot Gainesville used
[14:47] to be at the train station all right but
[14:50] it's no longer there it's up in town
[14:53] my point is and you know what I'm
[14:55] talking about
[14:59] the prophet said the rapture
[15:02] paragraph 130
[15:05] 153
[15:08] you know somewhere in the Rapture used
[15:11] to be on page 15.
[15:13] of the book
[15:15] he said the Rapture is a revelation amen
[15:18] then he goes on and he says and the
[15:20] bride will be waiting for the revelation
[15:22] of the rapture
[15:24] well that's what we're doing brother
[15:25] Dale we think we've been doing 45 years
[15:29] we've been sat down waiting
[15:32] are you at the bus depot
[15:35] or the train station
[15:38] for the airport
[15:43] well it wasn't matter if the Lord's
[15:45] coming
[15:46] if he's coming to the bus depot
[15:51] you're gonna miss it
[15:54] all right
[15:57] if we need the statue of a perfect man
[16:00] to be able to make a
[16:03] Rapture or changed in
[16:08] we need somebody to teach us how to get
[16:10] it
[16:12] and brother Randall said this is a
[16:14] requirement
[16:16] to have these things
[16:18] but yet we think we're in the message
[16:24] you see the Rapture has already started
[16:27] because it's a process
[16:31] first you must have the new birth then
[16:35] once you get to New Birth you're just
[16:37] ready to start
[16:39] then you hear this message
[16:43] and that's the shout
[16:46] all right
[16:51] and it's odd the prophet would say
[16:54] paragraph 130 the rapture
[16:57] that Jesus does all three of these
[17:00] things in his descending
[17:05] yet we spent our whole thing of a going
[17:08] up
[17:12] well you don't believe in the going up
[17:14] yeah I believe in a
[17:17] but I believe there's an order to it
[17:23] I believe what the Bible says and what
[17:27] the prophet of God said
[17:30] that the Lord himself shall descend
[17:34] so why are we talking about going away
[17:38] when we really need to be thinking about
[17:40] him coming here
[17:42] because if he does all three in his
[17:44] descending
[17:46] then why are we concerned about going
[17:48] away
[17:49] I want to be where he's at don't you
[17:52] is that hard to understand
[17:56] yeah
[17:58] well
[18:00] then if the shout has already went forth
[18:03] why are we looking for a shout
[18:08] we've already heard the message
[18:12] so the Rapture is in a process it's
[18:14] already taking place but what if you
[18:16] hadn't heard the message
[18:22] I don't care what you think you're not
[18:24] in the rapture
[18:29] I know I'm hard
[18:31] all of that but
[18:33] I'm fighting my own nature of ways
[18:36] because I know I've tried to make you
[18:37] believe this message
[18:39] and I'm trying my best to get away from
[18:40] trying to make you believe it
[18:44] he said well you hadn't made me believe
[18:46] it well that's all right what I mean by
[18:49] that is that I've tried to hold you and
[18:51] pour it into you and pound on you and
[18:54] maybe that's the way it's supposed to be
[18:55] you know I'm glad I've done it
[18:58] but it's still up to you
[19:02] to accept this message
[19:05] I can't make you believe it
[19:08] but it gets so on you until you see how
[19:11] the the people are of the message and
[19:14] realizing 50 years almost of studying
[19:18] and seeing that what they're trying to
[19:20] do with this message today
[19:24] what if it is that the Lord's coming
[19:26] this way and we we're trying to go that
[19:28] away
[19:33] when we're born again I thought the
[19:35] Bible said we were resurrected sitting
[19:36] in Heavenly places
[19:38] well I thought that was already in a
[19:40] process
[19:42] but we're looking for something to
[19:44] happen
[19:47] when one of this already happened
[19:53] right
[19:55] that's all I've tried to tell you and
[19:57] and all of the carnality is my ways of
[20:00] trying to explain it
[20:02] what if you've never heard this message
[20:08] are you expecting a Rapture without this
[20:11] message I mean is everybody going is the
[20:13] whole world going in a Rapture one day
[20:18] I thought the Rapture was only far
[20:21] the Royal Seed of Abraham
[20:24] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[20:29] oh
[20:30] and yet
[20:32] everybody knows all about it but what
[20:34] are they looking for
[20:37] discussing it recently with somebody
[20:40] and they said well I admit I was looking
[20:42] out there
[20:45] wanting to go out there
[20:47] and I've come to find out
[20:49] is taking place right here
[20:51] all right
[20:53] the shout the voice of the Archangel
[20:55] what is that the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:00] right
[21:02] you said well brother Dale I thought the
[21:04] bride going to call the Dead
[21:06] I believe she will
[21:08] but it'll be the Lord Jesus Christ and
[21:10] the bride
[21:13] not going to be you and me
[21:16] I've tried to explain that how many
[21:18] years 40 Years everybody thinks about
[21:20] adoption boy I'll be glad one these days
[21:22] God adopts me and I'll just be able to
[21:25] speak that word
[21:27] i i i i i yeah
[21:32] I don't believe it that way
[21:35] I don't believe adoption is the father
[21:37] going off the scene and the son coming
[21:40] on the scene you're going back to your
[21:42] Trinity in concept
[21:44] adoption is the father coming on the
[21:47] scene in the Sun as he did back there
[21:52] is going to be Jesus Christ that raises
[21:54] the Dead
[21:57] well
[22:00] is he going to be up there and raise the
[22:02] dead or is he going to be down here and
[22:03] raise the death
[22:08] and the trumpet the prophet
[22:18] where's there catching away in the
[22:20] Gathering
[22:23] we've got to be together
[22:26] but the prophet said we'll only be
[22:27] together in the resurrection
[22:32] right
[22:34] all right
[22:35] so Jesus does three things
[22:38] in his descending
[22:43] so then evidently he's already descended
[22:45] and I'm not those that bleed back to our
[22:47] and preached it boy and blessed God he
[22:49] came in 63.
[22:55] I believe he's been here all the time
[22:58] we just haven't been recognizing it
[23:02] I don't believe he ever left
[23:04] but that's where people are preaching on
[23:06] 63 63. well that's wonderful to the
[23:10] prophet
[23:11] but what good did that do you and I
[23:16] you know
[23:17] unless it's revealed to you and I
[23:21] then what good is anything all right
[23:26] so if the Rapture is a revelation amen
[23:30] all right
[23:32] and the bride would be waiting for the
[23:34] revelation of the Rapture evidently his
[23:37] references meaning that
[23:40] you know I mean I'm carnal I'm not
[23:42] trying to interpret him I'm trying to
[23:44] say what he says
[23:45] he said Brad would be waiting so if the
[23:48] bride is to be waiting for the
[23:49] Revelation Rapture evidently at that
[23:51] time she didn't have it
[23:55] I mean you know am I right come on
[23:59] or he would have said the bride's
[24:01] already got it
[24:03] no he said she'd be waiting for the
[24:05] revelation
[24:07] well you know what our problem is is
[24:10] they're saying the whole point is us
[24:12] getting into the position that we can
[24:14] hear
[24:19] and there's many voices
[24:22] in the land
[24:26] right
[24:30] but how here we without a preacher and
[24:32] how can he preach unless he be sinned
[24:37] all right
[24:41] but now do you understand what I'm
[24:42] saying on the code I've tried to make it
[24:44] a little point because a lot of people
[24:45] are here that wasn't here and I'm not
[24:47] trying to lose that part to this go on
[24:50] so we believe that
[24:54] the Rapture is a process that's taking
[24:57] place here
[24:59] and then after that process of the Lord
[25:03] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[25:05] shout voice of an archangel trumpet
[25:07] after that takes place
[25:11] the dead in Christ shall rise right
[25:13] because that's the resurrection right
[25:15] and then we shall be changed
[25:20] and go to meet the Lord in the air
[25:23] so there's a lot of things that
[25:25] transpire before we go up any at all
[25:30] and if we're missing that
[25:33] not knowing what's going on
[25:36] how can we be prepared
[25:39] if a trumpet give an uncertain sound how
[25:42] can be prepared to battle or whatever
[25:43] you need
[25:45] right
[25:47] but see it's not
[25:50] it's not heard
[25:54] but we have our own concept
[25:57] about it
[26:00] what do you think God's going to change
[26:02] his ways to fit my concept or yours
[26:05] I don't think so
[26:07] I think we better be finding out how to
[26:10] fit into his category
[26:13] all right
[26:15] so then if the if the Rapture is
[26:18] actually him coming here and getting
[26:21] everything ready for it to take us there
[26:28] why are we looking up there for it
[26:32] why not get into the message that has
[26:35] been brought
[26:40] us our only hopes
[26:42] all right then we went on into
[26:46] the
[26:48] coming of the Lord
[26:51] that's what it said we read there and
[26:52] John you know about the
[26:54] the coming
[26:58] what are we talking about in the coming
[27:00] of the Lord
[27:02] I said while ago we have many Avenues
[27:04] many thoughts many things can be said
[27:09] do you realize how long it would take to
[27:12] preach
[27:12] the coming of the Lord
[27:15] it has took 6 000 years
[27:18] to bring it it took four to bring his
[27:22] coming
[27:25] all right
[27:30] now in his coming
[27:32] then what is it
[27:35] okay
[27:39] look at number one
[27:43] on the notes
[27:46] and think about it
[27:49] because the Lord has three advents to
[27:51] the coming of the Lord
[27:54] now I want to show you how the human
[27:56] mind works
[28:02] and show you how that we do
[28:05] and that we lose total concept of what's
[28:07] going on
[28:08] I want you to read the title of that
[28:10] message up there
[28:13] and you know sometimes I think about not
[28:15] even reading the title because your mind
[28:18] gets hooked on something
[28:22] look at the title of this message in
[28:24] 1954 718. the great coming revival and
[28:28] the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[28:33] now if I gave that first
[28:36] before reading the quote I'm going to be
[28:39] halfway through the quote before your
[28:41] human brain starts running wild
[28:44] I want to get that message boy the great
[28:47] the great coming I've never heard that
[28:50] sermon
[28:51] and I done read you the quote
[28:55] and then you go home I didn't hear that
[29:01] okay we read the title
[29:05] okay the great coming
[29:09] Revival and the outpouring of the Holy
[29:12] Spirit now
[29:15] I wake up
[29:20] now let's read the quote
[29:25] you understand see I realize what's
[29:26] going on in the human mind because I
[29:28] have one too
[29:31] it don't work too good
[29:33] I got one
[29:36] but see
[29:38] you're sitting there thinking about what
[29:40] you're going to eat for lunch
[29:45] you're thinking about what you're going
[29:47] to do this afternoon and I'm reading
[29:49] what the prophet of God said
[29:51] I didn't hear him
[29:53] I remember one time I told a brother
[29:55] that brother Brown and said a certain
[29:56] thing he said he didn't say that
[29:59] I just listened to that tape the other
[30:01] day
[30:03] and he didn't say that brother Dave
[30:06] well I just went out and got the book
[30:08] turned to the page and said here read it
[30:14] I didn't hear him say that
[30:20] what did that mean he didn't say it
[30:23] no that meant her human brain was
[30:25] triggered off onto something else
[30:27] so untrigger that booger today and let's
[30:30] listen right
[30:33] there'll be Daryl B three advents
[30:37] of the Lord now here's the way the human
[30:39] mind works
[30:42] therapy 3x that's not what it said it
[30:45] says Daryl
[30:47] see you're trying to correct me
[30:51] you're spending your time
[30:54] trying to be so smart
[30:58] to show how smart you are
[31:00] I was listening brother Carly reading
[31:02] the scripture this morning and he's
[31:03] transferred two words just like that
[31:06] well how many of you heard all you
[31:08] didn't even hear what he said you heard
[31:10] him transfer them two words
[31:16] you see one of the folks that it gets
[31:18] you say well you're just getting old and
[31:20] you're getting hateful
[31:21] I think it's about time maybe to be
[31:23] hateful in one way
[31:26] to wake you and I up to our carnality
[31:33] you start talking to somebody and you
[31:35] tell them
[31:36] and their minds done clicked and they're
[31:38] not even listening to what you're saying
[31:40] so all right now you're down far enough
[31:42] to listen what we're going to read
[31:44] there will be three advents
[31:47] of the Lord an advent means a coming or
[31:50] appearing
[31:51] you know coming into being
[31:54] the first to redeem is right
[31:56] when he died for her
[31:59] second to receive his bride when he
[32:02] comes for her
[32:04] third with his bride for the millennium
[32:08] and there will be three advance
[32:11] now
[32:14] what does he say then and one of them is
[32:17] passed
[32:20] when Advent is passed
[32:23] and the signposts are showing that we're
[32:26] near the second Advent of the Lord Jesus
[32:31] we've tried everything we've had the big
[32:32] fours in the meeting tonight
[32:35] are you listening
[32:39] one part of the coming of the Lord is
[32:42] already passed
[32:45] it took four thousand years for it to
[32:47] take place
[32:53] his first coming was what
[32:56] to redeem the bride he died for her
[33:00] all right
[33:02] now the second part of that is only
[33:05] dealing with the bride
[33:08] is not dealing with his coming to Israel
[33:10] it's not dealing with a millennium or
[33:12] the end of the world
[33:14] it's dealing with coming for his bride
[33:16] now as I said the other day take those
[33:19] scriptures
[33:20] and move them about
[33:24] and what do you got
[33:29] brother Dale at the coming of the Lord
[33:31] ever I'll see him
[33:34] then where are you going to put that
[33:36] scripture
[33:37] well we're in the internet time we got
[33:40] TV
[33:43] there is no possible human way
[33:46] right now
[33:48] for everybody
[33:51] to see the Lord coming
[33:54] I don't care how scientific you are
[33:56] there's places in this world that the
[33:58] internet's not there
[34:01] right there's places that even your
[34:03] Facebook don't work
[34:08] right
[34:10] that's what I said one of these days the
[34:11] Rapture is going to come everybody
[34:22] come on
[34:24] but look
[34:26] the second time is to receive his bride
[34:28] when he comes for her and look
[34:31] and one of them is passed and the
[34:34] signpost
[34:35] are to show us what part we're in we're
[34:38] not in his first coming
[34:42] that has already transpired two thousand
[34:44] years ago
[34:46] we're in his second coming to the bride
[34:50] not to the world
[34:56] what did he say
[34:57] in the bride coming across it's the
[35:00] rising of the Sun
[35:02] coming out of the church
[35:05] yeah
[35:06] let's just read something because I said
[35:09] think about it go ahead brother
[35:12] Anderson and pull up
[35:16] first Thessalonians 5.
[35:21] we just read first Thessalonians 4 the
[35:24] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[35:25] worship and Archangel on a trumpet
[35:29] and we had that all figured out
[35:33] we had it all figured out about hey and
[35:37] an angel comes up and he raises the dead
[35:40] and then we hear that
[35:46] that's chapter 4 verse
[35:51] 17 18.
[35:54] chapter 5 verse 1.
[35:57] what are the times in the seasons
[35:59] brethren we have no you have no need to
[36:03] write unto you
[36:05] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[36:07] day of the Lord shall cometh as a thief
[36:10] in the night
[36:13] for when they shall say peace and safety
[36:17] when they shall say we've got the
[36:20] message we know all about what's going
[36:22] on we've heard the prophet's message
[36:24] what then sudden destruction comes upon
[36:27] them as travail
[36:30] but ye Brethren are not in darkness that
[36:33] that day should overtake you as a thief
[36:38] I thought we were looking for ever I to
[36:41] see him
[36:44] that scripture is pertaining to his
[36:47] Second Coming
[36:52] that ever I'll see him
[36:54] put that dire
[36:57] Paul is telling him
[37:00] it's so marvelous but it was so
[37:02] hard for me to comprehend when brother
[37:04] Branham explaining Paul when he was
[37:07] talking about
[37:09] that he was trying his best to get out
[37:11] of people's mind that the Lord Jesus was
[37:13] coming right then
[37:16] we've all taught Paul was trying to
[37:18] explain how he was dying he was coming
[37:20] into the Run said Paul was trying to get
[37:23] it out of their mind
[37:29] that don't fit our carnality right
[37:31] brother West or what we used to be
[37:33] taught
[37:34] we was taught that Paul was trying to
[37:37] explain about the coming
[37:39] 2 000 years ago
[37:41] he goes on to say there must be a
[37:43] falling away
[37:50] trying to get it out of the mind to the
[37:52] people that God was coming right then
[37:59] we're not the children of Darkness these
[38:01] things are not supposed to come up on
[38:03] you and I
[38:04] on a war
[38:10] in the bride coming of Christ the
[38:12] prophet said coming out of the church
[38:16] well I didn't know that was the coming
[38:18] of the Lord the second stage of it or
[38:21] second Advent what do you think it was
[38:25] if it's in three advents there's three
[38:27] parts to it or whatever you want to call
[38:29] it a wording
[38:31] one of them has already transpired
[38:33] because he's already come
[38:38] and we're in the second stage of it
[38:43] of coming for the bride to take her away
[38:46] you know what he's got to be here to do
[38:48] that
[38:49] so truly Paul was right the Lord himself
[38:52] showed us send from heaven with a shout
[38:59] you remember how we went through it
[39:01] trying to emphasize it that
[39:04] you could say to Paul said Paul
[39:07] what did you mean when you said the Lord
[39:10] himself shall descend from heaven to
[39:11] shout before it's an argument what do
[39:13] you mean Paul
[39:15] well we read that from our Baptist
[39:16] Methodist Presbyterian eyes or whatever
[39:20] and we read Paul said the Lord himself
[39:23] shall descend with a great big holler
[39:25] great big screen
[39:27] and then some angels going to come up
[39:29] and raise the Dead and then we're going
[39:31] to hear a trumpet say Paul what'd you
[39:33] say
[39:34] I said what God told me to say
[39:40] that Jesus is going to do all three of
[39:42] these in his descended
[39:44] amen amen
[39:47] right
[39:50] so then we're already in the Rapture
[39:52] parties it's in phases and now we're
[39:55] talking about the second coming
[39:58] the bride the coming to the bride
[40:01] not to the world not to the Jews not to
[40:04] anything but to you and I
[40:09] that the first part of it has already
[40:11] transpired because it already come to
[40:13] redeem the bride
[40:15] now he's coming to
[40:19] me
[40:24] remember Jesus comes three times future
[40:27] home
[40:28] he comes three times
[40:32] well see you say that well you're
[40:34] talking about him coming to the Jews and
[40:36] come into the world and
[40:41] who are you talking about
[40:45] he's talking about talking about the
[40:47] three advents with three parts to you
[40:49] and I
[40:56] this is the only part I'm concerned with
[40:58] I don't know about you
[41:01] I'm not concerned with him going to
[41:03] Israel
[41:05] I'm not a Jew I'm over here
[41:09] all right
[41:12] so then we talk about well I'm going to
[41:14] come and come and it just they're just
[41:16] coming I ask you to do it many years ago
[41:19] and I'll keep asking
[41:21] Look up the word c-o-m-e
[41:28] the word come
[41:31] it has no reference to travel
[41:36] it has no reference to Journeys
[41:41] the word come literally means to be here
[41:44] that's why your message the
[41:47] parisia perusia
[41:50] people went out
[41:52] talking about his presence
[41:56] I told them then I said look I don't
[41:59] want Jesus standing beside of me because
[42:02] he'd have to kill me
[42:05] because sin can't stand in his presence
[42:10] I want him inside
[42:14] this part of the coming of the Lord I'm
[42:15] talking about is something personal to
[42:18] you and I
[42:21] you know he ain't coming after everybody
[42:25] I was talking about this morning though
[42:26] the Bible talks about if you're not
[42:28] little flock you realize there's seven
[42:31] billion people in the world today
[42:34] you know and if he was coming after one
[42:35] billion I'd be a small flock
[42:40] what does it take
[42:42] how many million I mean it takes uh ten
[42:45] hundred thousand to make a million
[42:48] I remember in school they taught us how
[42:50] big a room had to be to put one dollar
[42:51] bills
[42:53] a million of them in a big old room
[42:56] it takes 100 million uh ten hundred
[43:00] thousand to make a million it takes how
[43:03] many
[43:04] million to make a billion
[43:09] right
[43:10] so if you came after a billion
[43:13] would be great I just don't think it's
[43:15] going to be that many myself but I'm
[43:17] just making a point
[43:21] it's fear not little flock it's only for
[43:24] the Royal Seed of Abraham
[43:27] but you see we're looking for the coming
[43:29] of the Lord
[43:30] when it's already started
[43:33] right it started 2 000 years in a in a
[43:36] consummation of physical form two
[43:39] thousand years ago it took four thousand
[43:41] years for that to transpire right
[43:45] and it started because that word Advent
[43:47] means a appear you know a coming and
[43:50] doing
[43:51] but to dislocate the scriptures look
[43:53] where you and I would be
[43:57] but do not follow what the prophet had
[43:59] to say
[44:00] look where we would be
[44:05] back there according to John 1 14 the
[44:08] word was made flesh
[44:11] that was his first coming
[44:13] yeah
[44:16] amen right
[44:18] the word was made flesh
[44:21] all right now we're not
[44:23] we're not far or not are not supposed to
[44:25] be looking for a physical coming
[44:29] of a Corporal body
[44:33] I gave you these the other day I've got
[44:34] them here if you need them
[44:38] Jesus don't set foot on the Earth
[44:41] until the millennium
[44:48] right
[44:49] yet
[44:53] he becomes visible Among Us and raises
[44:55] the dead and we're going to rapture
[44:59] join his second
[45:01] order Advent or whatever you want to
[45:03] talk about it to the bride now we're not
[45:05] talking about the world to get all of it
[45:07] out of your mind say well he don't
[45:08] understand the scripture because of this
[45:10] over here I'm not talking about to
[45:12] Israel
[45:14] there will be a coming of Jesus Christ
[45:16] to Israel
[45:18] after we get out of here
[45:20] but that won't be a physical body
[45:24] that'll be two two witnesses
[45:27] the Millennium is really the second
[45:30] coming of Jesus Christ in a physical
[45:33] form
[45:36] we're not dealing with a physical form
[45:38] of his coming
[45:39] we're dealing with a spiritual form of
[45:41] his coming
[45:44] that's taking place right now
[45:48] through the revealing of his word
[45:51] amen
[45:53] I'm not looking for the skies to open
[45:55] and I see a physical body of Jesus
[45:57] Christ
[45:59] run around and said these people with
[46:00] blood on their hands you know an oil on
[46:03] their forehead he said they're saying
[46:04] that the body of Jesus is here and he
[46:06] said that's incorrect
[46:12] that's not true
[46:15] in the bride coming of Christ is coming
[46:18] out of the church
[46:20] Home Alone never was in there
[46:24] it don't make no difference
[46:26] we was born between Eve and the Beast
[46:32] which is organized religion we was born
[46:35] organizational
[46:37] we must be born again in the soul to get
[46:39] us out of these things
[46:43] and if that don't take place there's no
[46:45] need to be talking about a body
[46:48] see
[46:50] so in the bride coming of Christ
[46:53] where he comes one time to redeem his
[46:55] bride he comes back the next second part
[46:58] of it is to get his bride
[47:02] and then he's going to come back with
[47:04] his bride in the millennium
[47:07] all right
[47:09] we're only talking about the coming of
[47:11] of God to his bride
[47:15] we have to divide these things
[47:18] and what does it make any difference
[47:22] all right
[47:26] what's going to take you out of here
[47:29] right well one of these days I'm going
[47:31] to hear that Shout
[47:35] you see where you're at
[47:38] you see why that it gets hard and won't
[47:41] show human flesh
[47:43] and why did I scream out
[47:46] let's get out of our carnality
[47:50] right amen I told the Baptist I said
[47:54] why is it you keep saying we're saved
[47:56] just cause we believe
[47:59] I said the Bible don't say that
[48:02] it does I said were
[48:05] right
[48:06] I said it says he that believer right
[48:10] right and his baptized shall be saved
[48:13] believe us is a continuation
[48:18] it's not yet I believe
[48:20] I believe it's message
[48:23] I'm just waiting on the bus to pull up
[48:26] well what if it comes on a train
[48:31] you understand all of what I was
[48:32] bringing a while ago
[48:35] what if it's an airplane ride
[48:37] you're down to bus depot buying a ticket
[48:45] well you're just trying to make it like
[48:46] that you want everybody to come here
[48:49] I want you to go where God wants you to
[48:51] go
[48:53] because if you don't go where God wants
[48:56] you to go you're hindering me and I'm
[48:57] hindering you
[49:00] this has never been built upon trying to
[49:02] build a church
[49:04] it's built on one thing
[49:06] God's word
[49:08] I love everybody people don't understand
[49:11] me I love people
[49:14] I spent my life
[49:17] trying to bring this message
[49:19] down into simple language that people
[49:22] can understand it
[49:27] but you see what we're quick to quote is
[49:29] like brother random would say they're on
[49:31] the Ohio River said the voice came down
[49:33] and says your message
[49:35] will forerun the second coming
[49:38] it will
[49:42] it will
[49:46] but the second coming
[49:50] can be applied to the Jews
[49:53] and this message will go to the Jews
[49:57] so his message will forerun
[50:01] the second coming is a millennium
[50:04] without this message we don't go to the
[50:06] millennium
[50:09] so it's exactly right but yet our mind
[50:12] has put it to
[50:14] I don't understand what he's saying he's
[50:16] saying that that there's three advents
[50:18] to it all I'm worried about is a second
[50:21] coming
[50:26] well
[50:29] where is the second coming to you
[50:31] then what is it
[50:37] right that's all I've tried to get
[50:39] across church is one thing
[50:43] his message would forerun the second
[50:46] coming
[50:48] all right
[50:51] I've explained that
[50:53] this message we're going to Israel once
[50:55] we leave here
[50:57] right
[50:58] this message will put us in the
[51:00] Millennium so he's right right
[51:03] but what is the part that you and I are
[51:05] to be concerned with
[51:08] the Advent of his coming to take us away
[51:13] if you want to call it Second Coming
[51:15] that's fine
[51:18] we just get to point in your mind what
[51:20] you're talking about
[51:25] we should not even be concerned with
[51:27] thinking about the trumpet
[51:31] we should be concerned with trying to
[51:33] get Jesus Christ here that can raise the
[51:36] Dead
[51:41] amen but you see we've got it all
[51:43] figured out we just need to hear the
[51:45] trumpet well
[51:47] you get a young guy and he comes in the
[51:48] message he really is on fire he's a
[51:51] fireball and he's going everybody just
[51:53] flocks to him oh this is it this is it
[51:55] that's what we've been waiting on
[51:59] now you know what I'm saying is right
[52:02] you just don't want to admit it
[52:08] but you run after these things thinking
[52:10] it's some kind of a
[52:13] great doings
[52:19] my brother Brown said
[52:22] if they come
[52:24] with signs and wonders
[52:30] but yet
[52:31] with the same message
[52:35] you are not to hear them
[52:38] the Bible says if a man give you a sign
[52:41] and it come to pass
[52:47] when he takes you to another God
[52:49] what he used to do
[52:51] get away from him
[52:55] but yet we no no we we can't do that we
[53:01] see I'm talking about in The Bride
[53:03] coming of Christ
[53:05] I'm not talking about the Israel the
[53:07] world or anything
[53:08] I'm talking about the part you and I are
[53:10] concerned with
[53:14] I've Illustrated it over and over Martin
[53:17] Luther probably preached no telling how
[53:19] many sermons on the scripture there
[53:21] where it says the judge shall live by
[53:23] faith
[53:25] here one day that jumped off the pages
[53:28] in that man's heart
[53:30] and he challenged the world
[53:32] and started a Revival over one scripture
[53:36] let the just shall live by faith
[53:39] he was like Moses it had
[53:43] 40 years
[53:45] listening to Mama
[53:49] right
[53:51] you're delivered you to this you're
[53:53] there all of their life
[54:00] we don't believe that way I saw a movie
[54:02] one time they showed he was it was about
[54:04] probably 40 years old before we heard
[54:06] about it
[54:08] don't give a hoot watch you saw
[54:12] brother random said
[54:17] but we don't want to quote that
[54:20] run around
[54:21] and see his mama
[54:23] you told him you are not
[54:26] a son of Pharaoh's daughter
[54:30] he raised he was raised he studied
[54:33] he knew the Scrolls
[54:36] he studied 40 years
[54:41] but all it done was brought him a
[54:43] stinking dead Egyptian
[54:47] right
[54:50] but five minutes in front of a burning
[54:52] bush
[54:55] the prophet said
[54:57] meant more than all the Mama's teaching
[55:03] that's all I've ever tried to get you to
[55:05] see
[55:08] wonderful message we've heard but if
[55:10] it's not revealed where are we at
[55:15] first
[55:18] Jehovah Witness reading room
[55:27] well what about it
[55:31] what do you think about rapture
[55:34] relating to his coming
[55:39] if he don't come here we don't go there
[55:42] right
[55:44] that's right
[55:45] well why would we be concerned about
[55:47] going there when we don't even know he's
[55:49] come here
[55:54] right
[55:58] I probably said he'd become visible
[56:00] Among Us
[56:03] well brother Dale now now visible that's
[56:06] means oh yeah let's see
[56:09] Webster says visible means that that can
[56:13] be seen
[56:15] perceptible to the eye
[56:19] apparent
[56:22] not a parent you know
[56:24] Mom and Daddy a parent
[56:28] knowledge
[56:31] it means to manifest
[56:35] it means to be obvious
[56:38] visible to the eye
[56:42] the prophet said he'd be visible Among
[56:44] Us and raise the dead and we'd go into
[56:46] Rapture that's exactly the second stage
[56:48] of the Rapture right because the voice
[56:52] of the Archangel is to be the Lord Jesus
[56:55] Christ to be here among us to raise the
[56:58] dead and we're going to Rapture but not
[57:00] you're in a Corporal body
[57:05] but to be visible
[57:08] Among Us
[57:10] what do you think about when you think
[57:12] of visible
[57:14] when I see it
[57:18] if anything you can see there's no faith
[57:21] involved
[57:23] for the raptures the prophet said the
[57:25] Rapture is a revelation
[57:29] he didn't say it's what you saw the
[57:30] eyeballs
[57:35] is what's Made Alive in your heart
[57:39] right
[57:45] visible
[57:50] he said he never puts his foot on Earth
[57:52] until the church has been raptured go
[57:54] ahead let's get number six on that and I
[57:55] got a minute let's get it look what he
[57:57] said this is taken from the sardesian
[58:00] church age which is 1960 1209
[58:03] I'm jumped a whole lot this morning pool
[58:05] number six
[58:08] but let me just drop this into your
[58:11] heart
[58:12] there will never be a Jesus set a foot
[58:14] on this Earth until the church has done
[58:17] raptured and gone
[58:22] well why are we looking for a physical
[58:24] coming
[58:28] I want the scripture for a physical
[58:30] coming
[58:31] he said I've you know until the church
[58:34] is done raptured and gone home
[58:37] now you just buy that in mind because
[58:39] there will be false Christ rise up
[58:42] now why is he saying that
[58:45] you know what false Christ are going to
[58:47] do they're going to teach you a false
[58:49] Doctrine
[58:51] a doctrine that wrote her down I believe
[58:54] he's going to be visible that means he's
[58:57] going to be standing here
[59:01] false Christ
[59:07] now quote wrote around him all on the
[59:09] hands before he says
[59:12] they're saying it to physical bodies
[59:14] here he said that's contrary to the
[59:16] scripture
[59:20] what about it
[59:22] look
[59:25] false prophets arise teaching false
[59:27] Doctrine
[59:29] but Jesus will not be here on the earth
[59:31] because the trumpet sounds and he never
[59:34] comes we meet him in the air the church
[59:37] is already gone and then when Jesus
[59:39] appears it'll be the returning back the
[59:42] Gentiles goes to meet him in the air is
[59:45] that the scripture they go to meet him
[59:47] in the hour and then we'll go up and
[59:50] Jesus never puts his foot on Earth until
[59:52] the church has been raptured and took
[59:55] home and wedding supper over in heaven
[59:57] then he returns back after the Jewish
[1:00:00] remnant
[1:00:02] you're coming back after the Jews right
[1:00:03] then he comes back after not even
[1:00:05] physical to them through two witnesses
[1:00:07] then he becomes visible or physical in
[1:00:10] the millennium
[1:00:12] well yeah we know all about visible what
[1:00:14] about this when going to number
[1:00:19] go to number seven where we can read
[1:00:21] that where people just understand it or
[1:00:23] the Holy Ghost given far paragraph 51
[1:00:26] roll it on up God's waiting on me and
[1:00:29] you
[1:00:33] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:00:35] adoption time when God can pour into his
[1:00:38] church his fullness his power to his
[1:00:40] resurrection that when the church in
[1:00:42] Christ becomes so close together till
[1:00:45] Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[1:00:47] raises the dead and we go into rapture
[1:00:53] he becomes visible
[1:00:55] but not in a Corporal body right he's
[1:00:58] already been here visible
[1:01:06] I'm waiting on you to think a little bit
[1:01:08] I got the notes to read okay
[1:01:11] he's already been here visible but now
[1:01:13] where does your mind say visible
[1:01:20] you got it recorded
[1:01:23] write it down on a piece of paper what
[1:01:25] you think he's already been here visible
[1:01:31] some of you wrote down
[1:01:34] Jesus on Earth two thousand years ago
[1:01:38] some of you wrote down the great
[1:01:40] doctrine of 63.
[1:01:45] when he become here
[1:01:48] when brother Reynolds say
[1:01:53] okay but remember he's the prophet not
[1:01:56] me
[1:01:57] not you
[1:02:00] look what he says on a message call
[1:02:04] number eight proof of his resurrection
[1:02:08] 1955.
[1:02:10] 404 10.
[1:02:12] paragraph 157 I want you to notice
[1:02:15] something closer now before closing
[1:02:18] on the very early morning when Murray
[1:02:22] Magdalene and Mata
[1:02:24] was at the grave first
[1:02:31] now remember
[1:02:34] this is after he'd done been here for 30
[1:02:37] something years
[1:02:40] death burial and Resurrection right now
[1:02:42] come on
[1:02:45] Christ showed himself visible among the
[1:02:47] early risers
[1:02:51] that's after his resurrection
[1:02:54] he never showed it anymore
[1:02:58] to the span of the day off day
[1:03:02] he's visible back there
[1:03:05] not Corporal standing on Earth
[1:03:07] he said after his death burial his
[1:03:10] resurrection
[1:03:13] right
[1:03:16] and he was visible
[1:03:17] among the early risers
[1:03:21] and he never showed it any more through
[1:03:23] this fan of day until the evening time
[1:03:28] then he made himself known again
[1:03:30] where he was Alpha and omeka
[1:03:33] I'll be light in the evening time the
[1:03:36] path of Glory you're surely find
[1:03:40] visible
[1:03:42] but not corporal
[1:03:46] right
[1:03:49] he was visible to those right
[1:03:52] that saw him touched him handled him
[1:03:56] but not in that Corporal physical human
[1:03:58] part he's already been made eternal
[1:04:03] right
[1:04:04] look at the next one
[1:04:07] number nine
[1:04:12] now here's we're going to do that again
[1:04:14] because if I read the title you're going
[1:04:16] to stop and your mind's gonna cut off
[1:04:19] so we read the title then your mind Cuts
[1:04:21] back on
[1:04:23] you're sarcastic no I'm just trying to
[1:04:27] tell you the truth
[1:04:29] amen you read the title their Arrow of
[1:04:32] gods deliver a shot from a bow I never
[1:04:35] heard that message
[1:04:37] if you
[1:04:39] honey honey you ever heard that message
[1:04:41] no I never heard that message well ain't
[1:04:44] no need me reading what he said
[1:04:46] well you're still tied up into what it
[1:04:48] is now let's read what he said roll it
[1:04:51] on up
[1:04:55] God we're so glad you've got to live in
[1:04:58] God we've got one who promised us
[1:05:01] he's right here with us
[1:05:03] showing himself visible Among Us
[1:05:07] and we thank thee for it
[1:05:10] will you let your humble servant he said
[1:05:13] by predestinated gift
[1:05:16] he was visible right
[1:05:20] not down through
[1:05:22] the truth he was visible back there to
[1:05:24] the early risers he's Alpha he's Omega
[1:05:27] that didn't mean he wasn't in those ages
[1:05:29] coming down no but he wasn't visible
[1:05:34] as the prophet is covering visible
[1:05:38] yet
[1:05:40] um
[1:05:41] Martin
[1:05:43] everyone said the greatest of all the
[1:05:46] messengers he said
[1:05:47] there was never a service that A great
[1:05:50] miracle never took place
[1:05:53] in Saint Martin's Ministry
[1:05:57] yet he's talking about something visible
[1:06:02] the visibility that covers the eye that
[1:06:05] we can see or becomes apparent to the
[1:06:08] eye or can make manifest
[1:06:11] he stood there after his resurrection
[1:06:14] in a glorified state
[1:06:17] and manifested himself visibly
[1:06:22] now your Prophet is talking about is
[1:06:24] visible in the last days so it must be
[1:06:26] the same way
[1:06:28] but was it visible too
[1:06:31] remember how the prophet would stand
[1:06:33] here and say you know back there
[1:06:39] he said he was with Abraham and them and
[1:06:41] said
[1:06:42] he turned us back Sarah was in the back
[1:06:45] behind him
[1:06:46] he said now let's see if that same God
[1:06:49] what visible
[1:06:55] he said now there's a man sitting right
[1:06:57] back here behind me
[1:06:58] in this baptistry
[1:07:03] he said he was planning on getting him
[1:07:05] some new shoes
[1:07:07] but said
[1:07:09] he decided he wouldn't get him he told
[1:07:11] his wife said no need to get in the
[1:07:13] money because I'm dying
[1:07:19] now that's what he was talking about
[1:07:20] visible
[1:07:23] all right now
[1:07:27] look at the next one
[1:07:30] forgotten beatitude 61.
[1:07:37] but that real power and manifestation of
[1:07:40] the presence of God
[1:07:41] has not been seen for years and years
[1:07:44] and years
[1:07:47] we felt it
[1:07:48] and we knowed it was here
[1:07:52] and we've seen gifts work with it
[1:07:56] but when we see him come visible Among
[1:07:59] Us
[1:08:02] with power in his church
[1:08:09] are you reading
[1:08:11] on the Hem of the Garment of the master
[1:08:13] and touch it
[1:08:16] he's talking about something in his
[1:08:18] church
[1:08:19] look at the last one into a quit
[1:08:22] perseverance
[1:08:25] 1962.
[1:08:28] e 121 wrote it on up
[1:08:33] he talks about today we're looking for
[1:08:36] the Messiah and the way he did it back
[1:08:38] there
[1:08:41] God is God he can never make a decision
[1:08:44] and then change and say I'll do
[1:08:46] something else
[1:08:47] and if he's Let the church go in
[1:08:50] just on theology
[1:08:53] without showing himself visible among
[1:08:56] them like that
[1:08:57] then he's doing something for them back
[1:09:00] there
[1:09:01] he didn't do for us
[1:09:06] but he promised to do it that's what I
[1:09:08] believe and that's what he proves
[1:09:13] now back to the original quote of what
[1:09:16] it becomes visible Among Us and raised
[1:09:19] the dead and we're going to rapture
[1:09:25] what are you looking for brother Dale
[1:09:26] him to become visible Among Us and raise
[1:09:29] the dead and go into rapture
[1:09:33] no no because you're out you missed it
[1:09:39] you remember what I told you how they
[1:09:40] done it you people with diabetics you
[1:09:44] prick your finger it doesn't bleed 90 of
[1:09:47] the time now you may bleed a little bit
[1:09:50] you know what I'm talking about you milk
[1:09:52] it with your fingers and it brings the
[1:09:55] blood out
[1:09:56] right
[1:09:59] so
[1:10:01] they just put little pins around their
[1:10:04] belts and things and walk up and stick
[1:10:07] their fingers and say
[1:10:09] the Lord's going to come down it's going
[1:10:10] to be blood Among Us and look at here
[1:10:13] and then melt the blood right out of
[1:10:14] their fingers and you start screaming
[1:10:16] and hollering that the Lord Jesus is
[1:10:18] here
[1:10:22] a deceiving trick of the devil
[1:10:27] and yet if I said that to most people
[1:10:29] that have went after that and believed
[1:10:31] it they would fight me to the death
[1:10:33] about it
[1:10:35] call me a false prophet
[1:10:38] but you see if it's not in the word
[1:10:41] I don't care
[1:10:46] the word tells us what's going to happen
[1:10:47] in the end time what the Lord himself is
[1:10:49] going to descend from heaven the shout
[1:10:51] voice over an archangel the trumpet the
[1:10:53] dead in Christ shall rise first and we
[1:10:54] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:10:56] changed putting Corinthians and thoughts
[1:10:58] Thessalonians together change in a
[1:11:00] moment of tweaking of mind be caught up
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:03] but it's already in a process taking
[1:11:05] place here
[1:11:11] the coming of the Lord is here
[1:11:15] and when he comes here visible Among Us
[1:11:19] then he can take us dire physically to
[1:11:23] meet him in the air
[1:11:29] you say brother Dale
[1:11:31] what do we look for
[1:11:33] come on folks this message to be
[1:11:36] revealed
[1:11:38] in this message is everything
[1:11:43] that you have need of
[1:11:47] yeah we can be so part and we believe it
[1:11:51] if time goes on there'll be a woman in
[1:11:53] the White House
[1:11:56] time goes wrong there'll be a pope
[1:11:58] coming out of the United States
[1:12:01] time goes wrong Russia will come as your
[1:12:03] oil
[1:12:07] those are the things your Prophet said
[1:12:10] and I believe it
[1:12:13] what about going to shut down and say
[1:12:15] well can't do that until the pope comes
[1:12:18] out you know I ain't got to worry about
[1:12:19] rapture
[1:12:22] I just goof off and do what I want to
[1:12:24] when the pope comes out of the United
[1:12:26] States I'll be there
[1:12:30] we'll be ready
[1:12:31] were bus depot train Airport
[1:12:37] sitting at home
[1:12:44] you get what I'm saying
[1:12:49] if this message is not revealed to you
[1:12:51] and I there's no
[1:12:52] change for us
[1:12:54] everybody's going to be changed get it
[1:12:56] off your mind
[1:12:58] everybody's going to be changed
[1:13:00] the Bible says it will be
[1:13:03] but what is that change
[1:13:08] in a moment in the twinkling and well
[1:13:10] they spent how many years do we spent
[1:13:12] his third year as a twinkle it's because
[1:13:15] of this it's because of that
[1:13:19] a twinkle
[1:13:22] we're as bad as bad as twinkle twinkle
[1:13:24] little star how I wondered who you are
[1:13:27] or who you belong to because now they're
[1:13:29] talking about you
[1:13:32] what is a twinkle if we can figure out a
[1:13:34] twinkle and we could figure out 30
[1:13:36] minutes
[1:13:40] you know about this place of half an
[1:13:42] hour
[1:13:43] and we can figure that out
[1:13:45] brother so-and-so over here he's figured
[1:13:48] it out
[1:13:51] where you want to go
[1:13:58] but what if it's like the prophet said
[1:14:00] about all this Blood Moon
[1:14:03] turned into blood he said I can show you
[1:14:05] where that's already taken place
[1:14:10] yet everybody was ready back a few weeks
[1:14:12] ago when that blood moon was coming at a
[1:14:14] certain time
[1:14:19] right that ain't no more than the old
[1:14:22] Baptist Church
[1:14:24] Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals
[1:14:27] whatever you want to call it Catholics
[1:14:29] you know they're looking for the coming
[1:14:30] of the Lord
[1:14:36] but what if it is
[1:14:38] that the coming of the Lord is this
[1:14:40] message
[1:14:43] that you and I are supposed to be
[1:14:46] talking about
[1:14:48] what is the shout is this message
[1:14:55] and yet we're wanting to find it in some
[1:14:57] other way or some body that's got some
[1:15:00] idea or some doctrine that can penalize
[1:15:03] our beings
[1:15:09] what about it
[1:15:15] what do you think about it there's three
[1:15:18] advents to the coming of the Lord that's
[1:15:20] tied to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:23] I had to re-title if somebody on tape
[1:15:25] get it I had them to retitle it I first
[1:15:27] put it the second coming but then I
[1:15:29] retitled it to the coming of the Lord
[1:15:31] because
[1:15:32] and the second coming is a deceiving
[1:15:34] point of thinking who's he coming to
[1:15:40] is he coming to Israel as you come to
[1:15:41] the end of the world is it coming at the
[1:15:42] wife don't judge me where is it coming
[1:15:46] many Avenues to be taken about his
[1:15:49] coming
[1:15:51] but I want to talk about is coming to
[1:15:53] you and I
[1:15:58] and the first part of his coming has
[1:16:00] already transpired
[1:16:04] and we're in the midst of his second
[1:16:08] Advent
[1:16:09] which is coming to take the bride away
[1:16:13] that was when the prophet descending and
[1:16:16] the spirit of God struck the Earth to
[1:16:18] bring it forth
[1:16:21] started that process of the second
[1:16:24] Advent of his coming
[1:16:29] you want this quote
[1:16:31] the coming the spirits Prof the prophet
[1:16:34] of the spirit excuse me the spirit of
[1:16:36] the prophet
[1:16:37] he talks about his coming
[1:16:42] see this is not a brand new thing most
[1:16:43] of you have been around here you know
[1:16:45] I've been preaching this for 40
[1:16:47] something years
[1:16:49] this is not a new thought A New Concept
[1:16:51] a new idea
[1:16:54] that's why we don't get caught up by all
[1:16:56] these doctrines and little tantalizing
[1:16:59] things that will run after something
[1:17:01] that's got a little jingle to it
[1:17:04] amen what does the word say
[1:17:12] now if Satan can impersonate every gift
[1:17:16] and even pass out Supernatural gifts
[1:17:19] right
[1:17:20] then why are we worried about gifts to
[1:17:22] get us out of here yet I believe in all
[1:17:25] of the gifts
[1:17:27] and the prophet said a church that don't
[1:17:29] have the gifts in manifestation we'll
[1:17:32] have to answer to God
[1:17:36] now that's
[1:17:39] I believe in your speaking in tongues I
[1:17:42] believe in your shouting I believe in
[1:17:43] your doing I believe all that's
[1:17:45] wonderful
[1:17:49] but when you get all of that done
[1:17:53] shouting the next week won't do you no
[1:17:56] good you know what I mean shouting today
[1:17:58] next week will do you no good
[1:18:01] you're gonna need some more shouting
[1:18:02] some more emotionals more doing but if
[1:18:04] you got something to eat
[1:18:07] the word
[1:18:09] then next week you can think about it in
[1:18:11] the middle of the night
[1:18:13] he said well you know that's what he was
[1:18:14] talking about
[1:18:16] that ties together with the scriptures I
[1:18:18] can see now that the Rapture is the
[1:18:20] coming of the Lord here
[1:18:23] and then he'll take us dire
[1:18:26] once he completes the process of getting
[1:18:28] here
[1:18:30] so what am I concerned with getting him
[1:18:32] here come on musicians what am I
[1:18:34] concerned with you didn't even hear
[1:18:41] getting him here
[1:18:46] what are we let's Stand Together
[1:18:50] the three advents of his coming
[1:18:54] and he never preached a thing about
[1:18:56] Israel and uh any other things that's
[1:18:59] just like brother
[1:19:01] mode I remember years ago we were
[1:19:02] listening to this certain brother a boy
[1:19:05] he had that battle of Armageddon he had
[1:19:07] that thing down and man he was preaching
[1:19:09] it you know that these troops come down
[1:19:12] here and they come down here from China
[1:19:14] and they come from Russia and they come
[1:19:17] down and they gather around there and
[1:19:19] we're going to get dark and boy those
[1:19:21] people would just go oh I can see the
[1:19:24] Hat
[1:19:26] we went outside and brother Mo walked up
[1:19:28] to the brother of course he wouldn't
[1:19:30] he's kind of like me he wasn't too
[1:19:31] popular either but I guess that's where
[1:19:33] I learned not to be popular from was him
[1:19:35] but
[1:19:38] he asked that brother he said brother
[1:19:40] almost called his name but he said
[1:19:42] brother he said
[1:19:44] where did Brother Branham say
[1:19:47] them forces come from
[1:19:50] to fight the battle of Armageddon on the
[1:19:52] fourth seal
[1:19:57] the brother he said
[1:20:00] I don't really know
[1:20:03] I'd invite you to go home and read the
[1:20:05] fourth seal
[1:20:06] and read the battle of Armageddon
[1:20:09] he never mentions Russia he never
[1:20:11] mentions China he never mentions any of
[1:20:14] those things that's coming down in a
[1:20:16] physical form
[1:20:18] you know what he talks about
[1:20:21] the denominations coming after the bride
[1:20:26] there's your battle of Armageddon
[1:20:29] why because first is going to be here
[1:20:33] a spiritual battle
[1:20:35] then when this is all over with yes it
[1:20:38] will be Russia and China and all that
[1:20:40] because there will be a literal
[1:20:42] Armageddon
[1:20:45] but if somebody don't win this battle of
[1:20:47] the Mind the greatest battle ever Falls
[1:20:49] right
[1:20:51] if somebody don't win the battle of the
[1:20:53] Mind ain't no need to worry about
[1:20:54] nothing else
[1:20:57] we can't keep up with a footman what
[1:20:58] about when the horsemen get here
[1:21:04] if you and I can't stand and say this
[1:21:06] message is right
[1:21:08] tell these garbage can people that's on
[1:21:10] the internets and all over the world
[1:21:13] and saying that brother Brown on my road
[1:21:15] this morning said one brother used to
[1:21:17] think he made 49 mistakes and now he had
[1:21:19] 149.
[1:21:21] I want him to come and show me
[1:21:27] show me where it's at
[1:21:33] but yet that's a good brother
[1:21:36] so is the Pope
[1:21:39] how many of us have ever been shot about
[1:21:41] what we believe
[1:21:42] one of them back few were pokes back got
[1:21:44] shot because of what he was
[1:21:50] and now he so lovey-dovey he's getting
[1:21:53] to Pentecostals and everybody together
[1:21:56] them together
[1:21:59] you remember the man got up and said how
[1:22:01] many years got the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:03] Ghost they'll raise her hand he said
[1:22:05] you're everyone Catholic
[1:22:07] thank you
[1:22:08] so what are you saying
[1:22:09] and the people started finally they
[1:22:11] jerked their hand down then when he
[1:22:12] explained it they all rejoicing
[1:22:18] he says there's no such thing as a
[1:22:20] protest anymore
[1:22:22] he said the protest was over
[1:22:25] he said we're all one we come back
[1:22:27] together
[1:22:32] I don't agree with it
