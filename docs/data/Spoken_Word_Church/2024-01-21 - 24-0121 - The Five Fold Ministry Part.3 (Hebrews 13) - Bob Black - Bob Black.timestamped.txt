[0:02] God bless you Saints good to be in the
[0:04] house of the Lord this
[0:06] morning and u i i sure got to say how
[0:10] much I appreciate brother John and
[0:11] brother Aaron the last couple of weeks
[0:14] for uh for their lessons and what they
[0:16] had to
[0:20] say let's see if we can get it up there
[0:22] we
[0:23] go and bring you greetings from all the
[0:25] saints up up there in in Kentucky at
[0:27] brother Larry Harris Church um it's it's
[0:30] good to have uh fellowship with other
[0:32] believers that know they're kind of
[0:34] praying for you and and uh and believing
[0:36] the same
[0:38] thing let's let's uh go to the Lord in
[0:41] prayer before we get into our lesson
[0:43] Lord we just thank you Lord for the
[0:45] being able to gather around your word on
[0:48] this cold morning and thank God that
[0:50] we've got a a real fire lord Jesus to be
[0:53] warmed by not some pain and Fire Lord
[0:55] Jesus and I pray God that you'll just
[0:57] warm our hearts Lord Jesus this morning
[0:59] as we ga gather around your word and
[1:00] study these things out Lord God help us
[1:02] to get the true essence of what these
[1:05] things mean Lord we pray in your name
[1:09] amen so um I'm going to read 2
[1:12] Corinthians chap 3: 1-6 and then we'll
[1:15] kind of get in back into the kind of
[1:17] where we left off last time in Hebrews
[1:19] 13 um talking about remember them which
[1:22] have the rule over
[1:24] you and Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:1
[1:28] he said Do We Begin Again to commit
[1:30] ourselves or need we as some others
[1:33] Epistles of commendation to you or
[1:35] letters of commendation from you I I I I
[1:39] was it's interesting to meditate on how
[1:41] often Paul Paul is just trying to
[1:43] convince people that that he writes
[1:45] these letters too and that he preaches
[1:46] to that we know what we're talking about
[1:49] he said you are our epistle written in
[1:52] our hearts you're the evidence you're
[1:54] the you're the evidence that our
[1:56] ministry is true you are our epistle
[1:57] written in our hearts known and read of
[1:59] all men
[2:00] for as much as you are manifestly
[2:02] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[2:04] ministered by US Written not with ink
[2:07] but with the spirit of the Living God
[2:09] not in tables of stone but in fleshy
[2:12] tables of the heart and such trust have
[2:15] we through Christ to God word not that
[2:17] we are sufficient of ourselves to think
[2:20] any thing is of ourselves but our
[2:22] sufficiency is of God who also hath made
[2:26] us able Ministers of the New Testament
[2:29] not of of the letter but of the spirit
[2:32] for the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[2:36] life now there's there's something to
[2:39] really meditate on as we as we study
[2:41] this these things out in Hebrews 13 that
[2:44] that um without the spirit you the the
[2:46] spirit is what the spirit is what gives
[2:49] uh meaning to the scripture it's what
[2:51] even e even as I'm speaking the way that
[2:54] the word is conveyed actually gives uh
[2:57] backs up the meaning gives the essence
[3:00] of what I'm trying to communicate you
[3:02] know you maybe you hear like a preacher
[3:04] sometimes with a bad attitude and and it
[3:06] just comes across different maybe the
[3:08] same words technically it would be the
[3:10] same words but but it'll come because
[3:12] the spirit gives the puts the meaning to
[3:14] it even a husband uh you know tell
[3:17] saying something to his wife he can say
[3:19] something in the in the with a different
[3:21] spirit and it'll come across totally
[3:22] different so you can see what what the
[3:25] spirit does this the Holy Ghost is so
[3:28] important because because it will
[3:30] actually illuminate the word that we've
[3:33] heard and give the true meaning the true
[3:35] essence of it now look what Paul's
[3:37] saying here he says but with the spirit
[3:38] of the Living God and he's made us able
[3:42] Ministers of the New Testament and
[3:44] what's the New Testament that God would
[3:46] put to give us the same life that life
[3:49] that was in his blood the life it put
[3:52] give that give us that same life so that
[3:54] we can not just live by a letter by like
[3:57] a legalistic standpoint where we're
[3:59] trying to obey a set of rules and things
[4:01] but where he gives us his same life that
[4:03] can actually illuminate the true essence
[4:06] of the word and and make us live out the
[4:10] things that were typed in the Old
[4:11] Testament so it's actually living now
[4:14] there's the difference between a painted
[4:16] fire and a real something real they a
[4:19] painted fire might be where you could
[4:21] write the word fire or maybe you could
[4:23] read the word fire in your Bible but
[4:26] when it's really alive in you walking in
[4:29] your feed and your in your hands then
[4:31] it's something that other people can get
[4:33] warned by because it's real now so you
[4:36] can see the spirit is what gives life
[4:39] the spirit is what gives life to the
[4:42] word that we're reading about and you
[4:45] can see I've got this little this little
[4:47] illustration of the you know the the
[4:49] words coming off the page and so like
[4:51] when you're talking when you're sharing
[4:53] things the spirit is the the all these
[4:56] things that are encompassed here in this
[4:57] little slide the emotional tone
[5:00] what what is the essence when When God
[5:02] Says something to in his word what does
[5:04] it really mean and you'll never know
[5:06] what it really means unless the spirit
[5:08] illuminates it to you because the spirit
[5:11] is relationship like brother Aaron was
[5:13] sharing in his last Sunday school lesson
[5:15] communion with God the spirit is what
[5:18] brings communion where you can you
[5:20] actually know because you've got a
[5:22] relationship with God what the word is
[5:24] saying you've got the context and the
[5:26] background and not just the context
[5:28] where you can read the story but you've
[5:30] got a context where you can You've Got
[5:32] Your Own Story You've got your own
[5:34] background and you know because you've
[5:35] walked with God and you've lived through
[5:37] all these things what the word is saying
[5:40] because the spirit is Illuminating it in
[5:42] your life so that's what the spirit does
[5:45] and that's in John chapter 16 why why
[5:48] John said when he or Jesus said there in
[5:50] in John when he the spirit of Truth is
[5:53] come he will guide you into all Truth
[5:57] for he shall not speak of himself but
[5:59] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[6:02] speak and he will show you things to
[6:05] come that's the spirit of Truth the
[6:07] spirit of truth is actually guiding you
[6:10] through the word and he's not going to
[6:12] speak of himself but he's going to
[6:13] illuminate the things that have already
[6:15] been spoken as we read through the word
[6:18] we're we're reading the we're reading
[6:19] what the prophets have said what Jesus
[6:22] said what Jesus spoke for those three
[6:23] and A2 years and the spirit is taking
[6:26] those things and bringing them to life
[6:28] in your life and giving you the true
[6:30] understanding of what's really being
[6:32] spoken now it's so important to
[6:34] understand that when you read this
[6:36] scripture that we kind of been
[6:37] meditating on remember them which have
[6:39] the rule over
[6:40] you cuz you can take that scripture and
[6:43] go two ways you can go rule like brother
[6:47] brandham would explain as as he went
[6:50] through the seven Church ages that
[6:52] nickan Spirit would rule over people and
[6:55] try to control them and force them like
[6:58] Augustine of hippo got in his head that
[7:00] I'm going to if they won't believe it
[7:01] I'm just going to burn them at the steak
[7:03] I'm going to threaten them I'm going to
[7:05] drag them out on the ice and I'm going
[7:06] to say you believe what I what I tell
[7:08] you or I'm going to force you to do it
[7:11] and that nickola it's an idea that takes
[7:13] the Liberty that takes the holy ghost
[7:14] out of the church that tries to control
[7:16] people by force
[7:19] or you can take where it's actually the
[7:22] word of God is controlling you and and
[7:25] and and and taking charge over your life
[7:29] now you see those there there's such a
[7:31] big difference between those two views
[7:33] but it takes the spirit to actually
[7:35] illuminate it and present present the
[7:38] real the real truth of the thing
[7:41] remember them which have the rule over
[7:43] you not man not a man ruling over you
[7:45] and forcing you to be a Christian or
[7:47] something like that that but the the
[7:48] word being presented through a man
[7:50] that's yielded by the holy go yielded to
[7:52] the Holy Ghost where the word can
[7:54] actually Captivate you and God can speak
[7:56] to your heart and begin to draw you
[7:58] where it's not you trying to live
[8:00] according to a set of rules and trying
[8:01] to satisfy God by your works but
[8:04] actually God claiming your life and
[8:06] beginning to draw you to
[8:08] himself I think so many people have got
[8:10] in their head that that's what the
[8:12] message really is is is a bunch of
[8:14] legalistic rules but that's not it at
[8:16] all it's God grabbing you by the word
[8:19] and you yielding yourself to it and
[8:20] saying Lord I'm going to let you I'm
[8:22] going to I want you to claim my life and
[8:24] claim my heart and claim my being and
[8:26] God you hear the voice of God and and it
[8:29] it's you know the the the the real the
[8:31] truth of the thing is that some people
[8:33] just will not be able to hear God
[8:35] calling them but some people will be
[8:37] able to respond to it that's right and
[8:40] so you can't it's not by it's not by
[8:42] force it's not by grabbing somebody and
[8:44] putting them in a headlock and trying to
[8:45] drag them to it because it's it's it's
[8:48] it's God that's do it no man can come to
[8:50] the father except he draw them so it's
[8:52] God that does the drawing it's God that
[8:54] does the calling remember them which
[8:56] have the rule over you who have spoken
[8:58] unto you the word of of God whose Faith
[9:00] follow considering the end of their
[9:02] conversation now there we've got these
[9:04] two ways that you can look at this
[9:05] scripture one somebody's somebody say
[9:07] you believe it or else and on the other
[9:11] it's the voice of God calling and
[9:13] drawing and the only way that you'll
[9:15] know the true essence of not just this
[9:17] scripture but any scripture in the Bible
[9:19] all these doctrines is by the holy ghost
[9:21] in your life giving a real relationship
[9:24] with him to open up and illuminate the
[9:27] word right in Matthew chapter 23 I I I
[9:31] think it's interesting too to meditate
[9:33] on how Jesus would just he would hit at
[9:35] this this Pharisee lay out a a a
[9:38] legalistic idea that you you got to have
[9:41] all these burdens and and all these
[9:43] rules and things that you've got to
[9:44] follow like in Matthew chapter 23 where
[9:47] he said saying the scribes and the
[9:48] Pharisees sit in moses' seat all
[9:51] therefore whatsoever they bid You
[9:53] observe that that observe and do but did
[9:56] not do not ye after their works for they
[9:58] say and do not for they bind heavy
[10:01] burdens and Grievous to be born and lay
[10:04] them on men's shoulders but they
[10:06] themselves will not move them with but
[10:09] but they themselves will not move them
[10:10] with one of their fingers and now
[10:13] Matthew 23 is a good chapter because
[10:15] that whole chapter is about this concept
[10:18] that uh uh uh that the legalistic
[10:21] mindset but we're talking about remember
[10:23] them to have rule over you the rule the
[10:25] rule to be a to to to to preach a word
[10:28] that can Captivate and draw people to
[10:31] God not to the minister or not to a
[10:34] particular geographic location not to a
[10:36] particular church but to Christ and he
[10:40] gave some Apostles and some prophets in
[10:42] Ephesians chapter 4 and some evangelists
[10:44] and some pastors and teachers for the
[10:46] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[10:49] the ministry for the edifying of the
[10:51] body of Christ so last time we as we
[10:53] were kind of going through all these we
[10:55] we we ended up at teachers and we looked
[10:58] at how Apostles or Setters in order a
[11:01] man that will come in and and set a
[11:03] church get a church started and and wait
[11:05] and labor with the people until a pastor
[11:07] is established and go into a territory
[11:09] where where nobody's been before and the
[11:12] gospel hasn't been presented and go in
[11:14] and and be able to labor with people
[11:15] that don't you know don't know anything
[11:17] about Christianity many times and
[11:20] Prophets that are seers that can look
[11:21] into the lift it up and look over the
[11:23] fence and in God's eternity and come
[11:26] back and tell you things that that
[11:28] nobody else with it with that doesn't
[11:30] have that gift or's able to do an
[11:31] evangelist can stir up the people and
[11:33] preach an encouraging word and make you
[11:35] feel like man I I want to go home and
[11:37] pray some more and pastors that can that
[11:40] can counsel and labor with the people
[11:41] and deal with their troubles and like an
[11:43] ox that can bear their burdens and and
[11:45] and you can tell all your troubles and
[11:47] things to the pastor and they'll help
[11:48] you out and and teachers that will we're
[11:51] going to break down just for a few
[11:53] moments here brother Brown said a
[11:55] teacher is a special man he sits back
[11:59] under the anointing of the spirit and I
[12:01] got a little puzzle here and is able to
[12:04] take the words and put them together by
[12:07] the holy spirit that the pastor or
[12:10] evangelist either one can not compare
[12:11] with them so see well now what the what
[12:14] the teachers doing we'll we'll come
[12:16] we'll come to church maybe and we'll not
[12:19] understand like some of these complex
[12:21] things that brother R preached about and
[12:24] it seems real confusing when you've
[12:27] after you've come under the influence of
[12:28] a teacher you're you leave the building
[12:30] feeling like you know I can't understand
[12:33] some somebody will come in and like
[12:36] maybe maybe you heard an evangelist that
[12:37] preach preached it maybe a vague way to
[12:40] kind of stir up the people and they just
[12:41] couldn't WR couldn't quite nail down
[12:44] exactly the details of what's happening
[12:46] with a new birth experience or what's
[12:48] what do we do what what do we do excuse
[12:50] me at church and but a teacher will take
[12:53] these these things that are it's like a
[12:55] puzzle and will break it apart to you so
[12:58] that you believe and you're under you
[12:59] can understand and you begin to
[13:02] understand because a teacher can break
[13:04] it break it down in a way where now
[13:07] there's there's the thing with a teacher
[13:09] a teacher will not produce confusion but
[13:11] a teacher will produce Clarity a teacher
[13:14] is going to remove the confusion where
[13:17] you leave you leave satisfied that
[13:20] you're able you're getting
[13:22] something brother R said and you must be
[13:24] born again he said when you're born
[13:26] again God vindicates you that's how God
[13:29] vindicates all of his Nature by their
[13:31] fruits that's the way he vindicates his
[13:34] ministry that's right all of his
[13:36] servants are Vindicated the same way he
[13:38] vindicates nature how do you know it's a
[13:40] peach tree now this is kind of getting
[13:42] into the calling too how do you know
[13:45] what you are like like you know brother
[13:47] Le Louise probably knows when some of
[13:49] the foreign countries and stuff they
[13:51] want to know what are you are you a
[13:53] teacher are you an evangelist and so you
[13:57] know sometimes Maybe you wonder what are
[13:59] you but he said what how you know what
[14:02] you are is By The Fruit by the effect of
[14:05] your ministry where you kind of fall in
[14:07] that slot and where you are will be will
[14:10] be uh everybody will know everybody know
[14:13] will know what you are because it's it's
[14:14] like a fruit tree they everybody will
[14:16] know if you're a peach tree or apple
[14:17] tree or whatever it's it's on
[14:20] display all of his servants are
[14:22] Vindicated the same way he vindicates
[14:23] nature how do you know it's a peach tree
[14:25] cuz it brings peaches how do you know
[14:27] it's an apple tree baring apples how do
[14:29] you know it's a Christian Christian
[14:32] signs bear from it Christian Life comes
[14:34] out of it now that's I want to live a
[14:37] life so so close to God where people
[14:39] don't wonder if I'm a Christian that's
[14:42] where you have a problem if I I don't I
[14:45] think there I
[14:47] don't how do you know how do you know
[14:50] he's a teacher the word comes from him
[14:53] now what that means is if you say you're
[14:55] a teacher and everything's confusing and
[14:57] you're not able to you're not able to
[14:58] string things together and nobody know
[15:00] after you get done it's just a mess of
[15:02] confusion that are you are you a teacher
[15:05] but when you when you you can preach and
[15:08] lay it out and everybody leaves feeling
[15:10] like they really got fed and and and and
[15:13] here's the thing too they recognize that
[15:15] you study because a pre a teacher is
[15:18] going to be called to study not just
[15:20] sitting there W watching Netflix all day
[15:22] or sitting there pumping their mind full
[15:24] of a bunch of Tommy rot but they're
[15:26] going to get in the word and labor and
[15:27] study because that's that's the fruit
[15:30] that a teacher is going to Bear a
[15:32] teacher a teacher can't help but get in
[15:34] the word cuz that's what a teacher does
[15:36] how you going to have anything to teach
[15:38] if you don't labor and studying the word
[15:41] So What do teachers do teachers are
[15:43] primarily focused on explaining and
[15:45] making scripture and Doctrine clear
[15:50] making it clear educating the church in
[15:53] biblical truth what does justification
[15:56] mean what does sanctification me break
[15:59] that down if it takes 10 sermons to do
[16:01] break it down what really happen what
[16:03] what really happens when the word is
[16:05] sown in your heart and why it's
[16:07] important to come to church and break
[16:09] all those things down so the people
[16:11] leave not being confused but
[16:13] understanding what it means to be a
[16:15] Christian and deepening the
[16:18] understanding of faith brother R would
[16:20] say now now here's really what a teacher
[16:22] does a teacher he can explain the word
[16:26] so you're bound to see it somebody can
[16:30] come to church with all their ideas and
[16:32] their opinions about well I think it
[16:34] should go this way and you listen to a
[16:36] teacher that breaks it down and and and
[16:38] after you're done somebody maybe maybe
[16:41] don't know nothing about nothing will
[16:42] come forth think I you know what I
[16:44] believe I I believe I can understand
[16:47] these things I I I I see it I I you
[16:50] can't help but see it when a teacher
[16:53] runs runs it down through the scripture
[16:55] from Genesis to Revelation and breaks it
[16:58] down a way that's clear and and and adds
[17:01] Clarity to the people you're bound to
[17:03] see it if you got any eyes to see it
[17:06] with you'll see it right now that's the
[17:09] gift of a teacher not to confuse but to
[17:13] bring
[17:15] Clarity the teacher has a special gift
[17:18] some of these things I just kind of
[17:19] pulled off the the internet different
[17:21] people things are say so this isn't
[17:23] something that brother Brown said but it
[17:25] goes right along with it a teacher the
[17:27] teacher has a special gift for
[17:29] clarifying confusion and misinformation
[17:32] making complex biblical Concepts
[17:34] understandable to Their audience and a
[17:37] teacher is going to be inclined to
[17:39] thoroughly research and explore topics
[17:42] that others might find mundane are
[17:45] complex and you might believe a teacher
[17:48] is going to want to dive into Daniel 70
[17:50] weeks even though maybe nobody else
[17:52] wants to get into that and they'll dive
[17:54] into it and spend time on it and or so
[17:57] anything like that something some some
[17:59] topics like that that others may not
[18:00] approach because a teacher wants to
[18:02] bring it's their gift to the church they
[18:05] want to bring Clarity so that other
[18:06] people can understand the things that
[18:08] that many others are afraid to probe at
[18:11] so they play a crucial role in
[18:12] challenging untruths and stirring
[18:15] curiosity and hunger for the scriptures
[18:18] and this is a picture of Ezra reading
[18:20] from the scroll when all the people they
[18:22] wanted to they wanted to have their life
[18:24] straightened up in there in
[18:25] Nehemiah they were they were willing to
[18:27] sit and just listen to him and questions
[18:30] and answers brother Ram said you must
[18:32] come under teaching you say I don't need
[18:35] no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost
[18:37] has come my friends that gives me just a
[18:40] little room to doubt whether you've
[18:41] really got it or not then see the way
[18:43] you're acting with it see the thing
[18:45] you're doing now why if there is no if
[18:47] the Bible says the holy spirit is the
[18:49] teacher why did the Holy Spirit put
[18:51] teachers in the church then to set the
[18:54] church in order the same Holy Spirit
[18:57] sure we don't need these seminaries to
[18:59] go around a big bunch of men to look out
[19:00] these things the holy spirit is a
[19:02] teacher see it's a teacher and it gives
[19:05] some fellow a gift of teaching then you
[19:07] must be subject to that gift now an't
[19:10] that what an interesting Dynamic that
[19:12] you sitting there with the Holy Ghost In
[19:14] Your Heart can listen to a man that's
[19:16] got the Holy Ghost in his heart that's
[19:18] called and has a special anointing to
[19:20] study these things out that maybe in
[19:22] your in Your Capacity as a little
[19:24] housewife or something that don't don't
[19:26] have the ability to go labor and study
[19:28] these things out and and open up library
[19:31] books and and things and and run run the
[19:34] all these deep things through the
[19:35] scripture but God God puts a special
[19:38] gift in a teacher to be able to speak to
[19:40] you and it's the Holy Ghost working in
[19:42] the teacher and the in the church and
[19:44] the person sitting there the Holy Ghost
[19:46] working and all and God give that gift
[19:48] in the church so that you could
[19:51] understand and have Clarity that's why
[19:53] he said in the seven Church ages God
[19:55] raise up ministers everywhere fill them
[19:58] with with the Holy Spirit now now this
[20:00] will squash that idea that we just sit
[20:01] at home without any ministers fill them
[20:03] with the Holy Spirit and send them forth
[20:05] preaching Lord like firebrands we don't
[20:08] know what hour we only passed this away
[20:10] once we're only mortal once and thanks
[20:12] be to God for that but the next life the
[20:14] next life will not preach the gospel and
[20:17] the next life that is to come but we
[20:19] rejoice in the gospel with them of the
[20:21] ages who's accepted it with a head
[20:24] captain our lord Jesus who's all worthy
[20:26] and all praise be to him forever and
[20:29] ever these kind of quotes really
[20:32] motivate me so many times brother R
[20:34] would say you've only got so many so
[20:35] many years to have children so many
[20:37] years to live for God so many years so
[20:40] you might as well that that encourages
[20:41] me when I when you know when you're
[20:43] driving on the road and things and you
[20:44] get tired and uh traveling and thing do
[20:48] as much as you can for the for the Lord
[20:50] because you've only got this little span
[20:52] of time that's what he's saying God rais
[20:54] up ministers everywhere why you can
[20:56] preach the gospel why you can do
[20:57] something something for the Lord because
[20:59] that's that's the only thing that
[21:00] matters is what we do for others and
[21:02] what we do for God so in second Peter
[21:06] Peter saying wherefore the rather
[21:07] Brethren give diligence to make your
[21:11] calling and election sure for if you do
[21:14] these things you shall never fall now
[21:18] just I I want to just meditate on how
[21:20] God calls a minister because you really
[21:23] you really like go all the way through
[21:25] the scripture it's it's God and every
[21:28] everything the reason why you're sitting
[21:29] here in church is not because anything
[21:31] you did the reason why you got the Holy
[21:33] Ghost is because go God did it he drew
[21:36] you he called you you all you did is
[21:39] respond you just you just you just you
[21:41] just accepted the invitation and and so
[21:45] it's the same with with a minister God
[21:47] God knows the special qualities that are
[21:48] in a man and he begins to draw and woo
[21:50] him and and that's one evidence of the
[21:53] way that a minister is calling brother R
[21:55] said it's the guy that's trying to run
[21:56] from it is the one that God uses see if
[21:59] he's trying to get away from it now
[22:01] really what's what's he saying here
[22:03] trying to get away from it not not where
[22:06] somebody says you better run no but it's
[22:09] the man who realizes within themself
[22:13] that they are inadequate that that that
[22:15] what a doning challenge lays in front of
[22:18] them and they can't do it within their
[22:20] own capacity even you know you're
[22:22] sitting back there in that Pastor study
[22:24] and you're sometimes before you come out
[22:26] and like Lord I I is is it going to work
[22:29] this
[22:29] time because you can't do it of your own
[22:32] ability and and you think about all
[22:34] these examples Through the Bible of
[22:36] Jonah and Moses and Gideon and Jeremiah
[22:39] Jeremiah that say it said told told the
[22:41] Lord I I cannot speak for I am a child
[22:44] now there's a man that's running from
[22:46] his calling because he knows that in his
[22:48] own self he's inadequate and and and and
[22:51] brother Ra was going say that's that's
[22:53] how you know is something real cuz when
[22:55] you're trying when you're trying to put
[22:56] yourself into that position
[22:58] and trying to do it yourself because you
[23:00] think you're the best one for the job
[23:02] that's a good that's a good Mark that
[23:04] something's off because our depend we're
[23:07] depending on God for everything we're
[23:09] depending on God for everything that we
[23:11] say and everything we do we're trusting
[23:13] in Jesus for it he said the callings in
[23:16] me if he's trying to get away from it oh
[23:18] brother I tell you the callings in me
[23:20] but I man I'd hate to try that well
[23:24] there you are you see that that's trying
[23:26] to run if he wants to do it so bad the
[23:28] first thing you know he finds himself a
[23:30] stuffed shirt somebody that's arrogant
[23:33] somebody thinks they know more than
[23:34] everybody else oh that's that's where
[23:36] the spirit comes in if you've got the
[23:38] right Spirit it actually will open up
[23:41] doors if you if you got the right Spirit
[23:43] well you can convey it like not like
[23:45] somebody told me a minister said you
[23:47] know some some some people will get up
[23:49] behind the pullit like they've got their
[23:50] two guns blazing ready to shoot at the
[23:52] place and ready to tear set everybody in
[23:55] order but somebody that's humble that's
[23:57] that that that that that's coming with
[23:59] the right spirit because the spirit
[24:01] conveys the right meaning behind The
[24:03] Words the spirit is going to give the
[24:06] essence of what's trying to be
[24:07] communicated he said like you said God
[24:09] you give me power to move mountains I
[24:11] tell you I'll do something for you if
[24:13] you let me move mountains no he wouldn't
[24:15] he can't even move himself to the right
[24:18] attitude so he'd never move mountains
[24:21] for God oh that's that's something to
[24:24] really meditate on to have the right
[24:26] attitude we remember where brother R
[24:27] said I'd rather have the right Spirit
[24:29] I'd rather have the right spirit because
[24:31] if you got the right Spirit everything
[24:32] is going to move into place if you can
[24:35] be taught if you can be moved by the
[24:37] word then everything else will line up
[24:40] eventually but if you got the wrong
[24:42] Spirit nobody's going to be able to tell
[24:43] you anything uh and anyway I'm get off
[24:47] that questions and answers brother Ram
[24:50] said so always do this make your how you
[24:52] make your calling an election sure
[24:54] whenever you feel that you're supposed
[24:56] to do a thing first find out if a
[24:58] scripture will do it he said first I'm
[25:01] going to skip down to what's in yellow
[25:03] first see if God calls then usually I I
[25:06] watch it for myself this is me I watch
[25:08] the nature of the person and see what
[25:10] kind of a gift that they're professing
[25:13] see God will work his creature the way
[25:15] he's made him he'll make a creature if
[25:18] you see him real real flighty and going
[25:20] on and he says and the musicians can go
[25:22] ahead and come and we'll end on this the
[25:24] Lord called me for such and such to be a
[25:26] pastor now Pastor can be a flighty
[25:28] person a pastor's solid sound see God
[25:31] called me to be a teacher and watch him
[25:33] how he interprets the word see he gets
[25:35] it all mixed up and everything then you
[25:38] can tell see but then the next thing to
[25:41] do the thing to do your position is
[25:43] usually known whether you can do it or
[25:47] not I watch the nature of the person and
[25:51] see what kind of a gift that they're
[25:52] professing your position is usually
[25:55] known whether you can do it or not
[25:58] God bless you Saints we'll end right
[26:01] [Applause]
[26:08] there
