Day now look don't confuse that with tomorrow's not Veterans Day tomorrow is people that have already give their life and we memorialize the ones so we need to remember the ones that have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and in on Memorial Day we memorialize those that have passed on we have a few brother Tom several ones that who brother dick was in the Navy okay I don't remember them all but some of them that have went on some of them were in battle that we never knew but some of them made it through and now they've passed on went to be with the Lord so we memorialize them in what freedom we have we got it from winning wars same way with here we get our freedom in the Lord by winning some Wars by winning some let God plate you know we'll let him work the battle for us but we want to remember them tomorrow and also be safe be careful in what you do and we always hamburgers and hot dogs but next Sunday we're going to start with Sunday school for everyone what we're going to do is we're gonna spread everybody out and the young kids will be in the middle room where we eat and Anna will be splitting the two rooms and then sister Rachel will be outside so we need to some of you brothers Bob when everybody's finished coming in in the Sunday morning bring those white tables so that it's just a Rachel on them can sit under the under the shed out here or the awning and have their Sunday School classes but we will resent that next week also we'll have communion after the second service amen to that amen but but no foot washing at the moment and we'll see how that goes remember brother Luis he'll be preaching Wednesday night I also remember him he's on his way back from Beaufort or in that way Hilton Head preaching for Hispanic brother down there also remember June the 6th which will be not this coming Saturday but the next Saturday's Bible study we'll have our Bible study again we'll try to spread out as much as we can we'll spread out as much as we can I love Bible study if you know if you never come you need to try it sometime might help you walk a little bit June the 7th we will have second service will be a youth service so we'll announce that a little bit more next Sunday but will we've got one Sunday in between and then July the 4th we may have a special service on Saturday we're still working on that so if you got your Bibles let's turn to the book of Corinthians 1st Corinthians 10 let's just read one scripture get into art we're still in the journey of a Christian our journey of a believer and we're walking now into the book of Esther we went through the Book of Ruth and we now we're in the book of Esther so we're going to speak of a of a little girl that had a very unassuming beginning and then she became one of the most powerful people in the kingdom and then and always remember we'll give you the characters and tell you who they are and what they're doing so let's bow our heads before we get started and speak to the author the Heavenly Father Lord today we are standing here Lord knowing that things are not as they used to be but we know that you never change you're the same yesterday today and forever and Lord you will be our God if will allow you to do that through all this concern and fear that man has we see some people that literally are are shaking in their boots as we always say because they're fearful of this of this virus going around and lord we've taken the position here you know to be cautious but have faith and not have fear to have faith Lord that you'll take care of the ones that Lord faithfully do what you say Lord and not provoke you father we realize that this world has no clue what's going on and they really don't know what roadmap is ahead but Lord you've give us tomorrow's news today we don't have to literally read the newspaper to know what's heading and what's coming and what we're heading into the father it's a great time to be a Christian it's a great time to be Lord held in your arms and let you take care of us as you did through Boaz and Ruth where the great boy I stood and took the shoe off and said I now will take the possession of Naomi's property well Lord we see that happening in the world but we see it happening in our lives our lives are literally being played out through these characters in the Old Testament Lord I pray today that we'll see that in the book of Esther how Lord a little young unassuming girl becomes a mighty queen in a huge Kingdom and Lord we know that his brother they'll read this morning revelations Lord his wife has made herself ready and we're gonna rule and reign on this earth Lord you took us from the sheep coat you took us from a life of sin and despair and you made us Lord the greatest people on the face of the earth the bride of Jesus Christ an eternal bride not just one that's going to be one and past no this is an eternal bride you had us in your mind way before you said let there be light and Lord I pray today that you'll come down among us in a special way to today Lord and manifest yourself among us by the opening of the word father give us this day our daily bread we've truly assembled to hear from you Father so I pray that you be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does the revealing and you'd be the one Lord that takes over this service we ask in Jesus name Amen first Corinthians 10 let's read just the last verse we know that Moses and all went through the different things and how that God's telling us that everything they did was for an example I mean yeah I was thinking the other day we didn't go through this too much but you know when Moses when they when they had their wife what they had their Passover they clearly killed the lamb and then they left Egypt right well what's the first thing that come to water water they were baptized they went through the Red Sea in type come out on the other side and here's Miriam having a Pentecostal revival and in here here they got to go through 40 years of the wilderness of what it's kind of weird that that wilderness was named the wilderness of sin 40 years they wander through the wilderness same just like me and you what for sanctification to get rid of all the old ideas that they had the old fighters the old ones remember they all died in the wilderness all the old ones there and then God raised up a new group to do what to be circumsized and then go over into the promised land so we love that that you keep even seeing more and more even you you preach on it your study on it and I brother Dale does all of you should do the same thing you should read the Bible and then go man I didn't see that who added that because it wasn't there the last time I read it six weeks ago you know what it was it wasn't your time to see that piece of the puzzle but now we come we see when we see when we see the puzzle we see that there's what some pieces missing maybe back through time but today we got all the pieces and we even saw the picture on the box before we even started getting the puzzle put together so we know what it looks like we know it like I said before everybody's it's kind of funny in a way but it's not all the whole world is talking about Antichrist Antichrist answer and they're making it a chip and they're making it a you got to go get tested and they're putting a chip in your body and that's the Antichrist and Bill Gates is the Antichrist and Donald Trump the Antichrist and this was the Antichrist net they miss the whole thing and here we are here we are listening to all that going no no that's not what it is thank God he sent us a prophet a man that told us he said he said don't fear communism but watch it don't fear will Russia but watch it we saw the other day yesterday I think to come through the through the email that that brother Ernie sent sends us did y'all get that where Russia is condemning brother branham's books and kicking them out of the country somebody must have got one of them but where brother Burman said watch Russia watch the bear she's not dead she's just sleeping and when Russia comes down for the oil and Russian soldiers walking the streets of America somebody must have found that out and heard that and said I don't want that in our country no more but see even that's not the Antichrist the Antichrist is a system that we're already in here we're not in it but we're around it so it's just you watch people and you think man thank God for a direction that we have gods give us a direction through a prophet through the Holy Ghost through the Word of God that our puzzle looks much different than the world's puzzle and you know what that's gonna do that's gonna separate us and that's what's gonna get us in trouble with the regular world cuz regular world's going old that's the antic no no you look at that he says who's the Antichrist the Roman Catholic Church and the system and she had daughters so don't worry don't forget about the daughters in that system so so let's not I'm not making a joke but you look at the people running wild with all these different things and we know you just step back and go than in it it's got everybody fooled except the bride everybody every system its fooled except the bride of Jesus Christ amen so thank God again not for just bringing only his word but for sending us a Mordecai a little man a prophet because you're gonna see this Mordecai step on the scene and he's going to take this Hadassah our Esther and he's gonna lead her and guide her into being a queen and I love this story the book of Esther just really full of really good things so let's read the last verse 11 if you don't mind whew now all these things happen under them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come that's us that wasn't even that was that was Paul writing 2000 years ago it wasn't to him he wrote that prophetically for me and you because here we are this is we are the they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world to come you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and I was we were talking in the Bible study this morning our Sunday School class this morning where we we see that there's um there's three stages to the new birth we know that but then that's not all there is to it we see that even with everyone every type we see of the baptism of the Holy Ghost even with Abraham coming to what Abraham coming to a type by the circumcision by his faith in what God said remember he continued on and had to take a child that he had born and had to take him up on a mountain and God tested his faith and then the same way with Ruth Ruth comes to a place of resting less Boaz does to do the work for and then all of a sudden what happens to them they go forward in their revelation and have a child then end the story right then it ended the story comes when they have the child when there's a conception when you keep on going when Abraham has the promised child you understand what I'm saying you and I are not commissioned to say we were talking this morning about revelations 3:14 we were counseled to by I said we're counseled to do all these things in the end time that they weren't they didn't have to do in the first stage second days third age fourth fifth six days but in this age were required to go to full adoption we required to as brother Dale was talking about the son of man is is him that was God in human flesh there's your headstone the person of Jesus Christ now when he comes back in the end time he's not going to be in a physical body one he's going to be in him yester a many membered bride that has you'll see in a little while that Esther comes from just a poor old child to where she gets full authority in the kingdom she marries the king and he she tells him what to do basically not and you understand what I'm saying we don't tell god what to do but we are part of the plan and God don't mind if we remind him of the plan and then so he doesn't remind if we do that I love what brother Brown said he said that God doesn't mind you reminding him of what he's already said and man so you remind God how many of you I do remind God I said look God you promised I'd have my children you promised me that whatever your whatever situation you're in you promised me that and that God's not going well I don't I resent that God don't resent that God loves for you to say that because you're just telling him back what he's already said and one day we'll get a revelation of it and it'll become he'll come to fruition so let's look at now as the journey of Abraham the point we were making this morning is it's okay to be it's fine to be born again and have them have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be and you be a Christian but it's like even in even in regular life if you it's wonderful to to have a child and and there's a little Chloe sitting there you know laying there she's about the guns leave no she's not she got thumbing her mouth but she's a beautiful little girl but you know the conception and the birth was just the beginning of her life wasn't the end it's the beginning you got feed her she's sucking her thumb now she's getting a little bit extra nutrition but some dirt and some or whatever else she'd been playing with but you say that's the way God is with us he doesn't want just oh I have this wonderful baby now I'm gonna go and I'm gonna put it in a room and I'm it's so beautiful I'm gonna leave it in that room I'm not going to touch it like dad's always said that many times he looks on the wall and sees us in different stages of development and he wants you know why wish they would no you can't do that to a grunt to a person we're supposed to come on this earth and grow alright so same way we'll be in the Christian and you can't grow without being a born again born again Christian then the feeding begins then what test becomes four testimonies then the things in our life our journey just begins at the new birth same way with a lot Abraham Abraham now remember his journey started from and went through justification sanctification and you got to see that in your life I say it again if you can't see that in your life then I journey you to start over not gonna hurt a thing start over thought over go to justification to say God forgive me of my past sin go to the water repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy Oh promise sanctification because many times we look come on you know you you talk to people out in the world I said well I quit this quickly I quit this quit back with this even message people well I know I'm born again I cuz I quit smoking no I don't mean it that means that you may have got sanctified and you started coming to church and that unclean spirits driven out of you but what do you fall out what do you fishing get full up again because remember it's still open the same one can come back in what waters good and make you what a believer but it will be a mate believer no it's true believer as we look about this morning just to I want to really get into we're going to get into the book of Esther really good but I want you to keep getting what's going on here there has to be a growth stage and every one of us there has to be and you've got to identify that you are in that growth stage not that you're just I'm born again I saw you know I I pressed I mash the button and there God speaking to me through William Branham that's okay folks let me tell you how let me tell you how deceiving it is just like I've told you many times before the devil is one person right he is a literal person he's not some goofy spirit he's a person anointed cherub God made him to be his right-hand man he has never talked to three people in heaven he stopped the one person he knows there's one God because he talks to him all the time but then he turns around and he says oh there's three you see how deceiving that is the very man that's deceiving you the worst deceivers a man in those 99 percent of the truth of somebody or something right because he knows just enough to get you drawn in because look God never in his life ever was three people but Satan decides to come down to earth at Nicaea into Dark Ages and he gets inside people's brains and tells them why he must be a light substance there must be three people because it was God taught son talking to if you see what I mean he was reasoning same thing happens now so Satan's not this person is going to tell you hey listen let's don't go to church let's oh no that's probably you most of the time but the devil take you go to church but but don't believe what's going on or or wish you or somewhere else or sit there and fill your mind full of all these other things and I really don't know why I'm saying this today but maybe I'm saying it for somebody but that's our problem that's our issue that's why we that's why the children of Israel were 40 years in the wilderness of sin they were not but just a few miles miles miles from the promised land brother Brown said would twelve days make journey or something but not just a few days and two million people they weren't just a little group you walk two million people and listen you got to have cattle goats sheep lambs provisions something for bread water all that so you've got this you look out in this field and you put two million people well two million people maybe a mile long and a mile wide so they literally had to walk in circles around the promised land and have to be looking down and seeing their their shoe prints from about two or three years ago you understand what I'm saying and that's the way we've been we've been falsely taught not by message I'm talking about out in the world and then you come into the message of the hour and you know what who came with you Satan came right with you Satan came right with you come right in here and he set down in the message Church and he said you're fine you listen to tapes don't you okay what are you doing about it what's your life are you able to take what you've got and put it in these people's walk in life are you able to say that I once was a Ruth and then I had to make a decision I had to make a decision to go with Naomi I had to make a decision to go to a place that wasn't mine to go to a place you know our we all and here's our biggest problem with this coronavirus it's got us out of our comfort zone hey man yeah go ahead please say yes yes Tony you can even Amen that get us out it's got us out of our comfort zone I'm asked what he's done so what is what's God doing I hope he's getting us out of our comfort zone because the devil wants you to be lazy easy lay out a seal rich have needed nothing naked blind wretched miserable and don't know it I want us to know it I want us to know I was telling somebody yesterday we're talking I think me and Jim was talking about something I said you know it's it this thing that's happened is what God allowed to happen we know that and he did it to what try us to see where we be in the faith or not all right so and not I'm just not saying here in this building or downstairs but you're gonna see a great shaking that's going to show every time something shakes something fouled off and then every time something shake something falls off so God's just going to keep shaking they're just going to keep falling keep shaking they're gonna keep falling but the bride will never fall she can't fall she can't fail she's anointed to make the journey just like Caleb taught the endtime bride right Caleb taught the bride Caleb stood there forty years later and said I'm just as strong now as I was 40 years ago and God honored his faith by giving him a mountain God will honor your faith in your journey some ways gonna give you a mountain and that mountain is the statue of a perfect man and on top of that mountain is where you gonna have victory on top of that mountain that's where you gonna meet that man on top of the mountains where you're gonna see that you are part of this son of man I don't say movement because it's not a movement a movement is something that moves and goes away this don't go away this this is gonna move us into a body change hey man the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is great to have but we gotta have plus in this inten time it's required it's required that we have not something different but we are different we have promises in here that a lot of people don't have so that does make us different I like brother Brian said he said I hate to say it he said but God's a segregationist he don't want you to mingle with the world out there he don't want you to do that he wants you to what why do you tell Israel hey marrying your own people don't go outside why he was saying that naturally for them but also saying that spiritually for you and I don't go out and mingle and go get these different things out in the world cuz you got to bring a lot of things in maybe sometimes that you really didn't see while you're in the journey and while these people didn't see but as we go through this journey I want everyone one of you to see where you're at right now that's why I'm doing this journey of a believer not a journey of an unbeliever it's a journey of a believer somebody that believes and if we believe then we must believe on to the end it doesn't matter if you file if you if you go by the grave like brother Collins the other day what a wonderful thing what a wonderful testimony you say oh he's no he died no he's not he's more alive now than he ever has been he don't have to get up in the morning go light bill phone bill God take care of this got taken oh he's over there going oh god bless you brother branham I told him other day I said he was she said his wife said he was you know listening to a lot of tapes said he loved that voice he didn't hear a voice on the tape that morning he heard the real man I'll get cuz you know what you're gathered with your people right he was gathered with brother Branham and brother mote and all the different ones here brother Tatum and all them brother Gary and some of the ones I'm saying someone's he's really knew very well and then there's brother Branham and I bet you he just if he could have cried he would have cried but he did and he couldn't cry but he was so happy to see the guy that he had listened to all his life he could finally see that person now show me where sadness comes in that Oh departure and we know all that is sad but mine didn't know what we're living for and I'm not just living to see William Branham I'm living to see Jesus Christ but you know we don't literally see him though not yet not till the resurrection not till we meet him in the air so we're going to see brother Branham and all these different people that's went on brother Tommen and and all the ones just went on we're gonna see them first then we're gonna rejoice and then we're gonna meet Jesus in the air the one that made all this come about see you keep that in your mind as we go through this and we look in the roof let's pull this back up just a minute because we know that and I'm not I don't want anybody say well you're saying you're belittling the Holy Ghost no you got to have the whole ago but that's the beginning of your journey it's not the end that's the beginning if you're still alive that's the beginning of your journey I don't care how old you are what a great thing brother Adam walks across the curtain of time he sees this 18 year old girl run up and hug his neck and say oh my precious brother and then runs off and the angel now watch the angel there was a lot of people did that but that angel said did you recognize her he was making a point he's making a point he said you recognize her he said never seen her before in my life in other words the angel said yeah you did said she was 92 years old when she came to the Lord and got saved in your meeting and no and then brother Graham said no wonder she said my precious brother and she was so happy live 92 years in the world of sin and then come now the Prophet didn't save her let's get that the Prophet didn't save her but he brought her to Christ and Christ saved her and by that he met her over there on the other side and there was the fruit of what brother Baumann is and I believe brother Brown was like man what am I scared of now why would I be scared and here we are 18 years old and and all these people he said millions of people are saved under his ministry and we know that because it keeps it keeps happening it keeps happening it keeps happening wherever that black is it keeps happening keeps happening keeps happening this journey is not over yet but it's getting close so the journey the journey though is in four parts we have four parts of our journey to come to justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and placing our adoption are being rewarded amen so let's just don't say I'm born again no listen when I got born again that's just when the fight began it's been a fight the whole time but you know what the battles are a lot easier just like this battle that the world's fighting with this virus I'm not fighting that battle I'm not fighting that battle but Don yeah what battle that's right the petals inside here I want to get that coronavirus I love this thing right up here I ain't worried about to get you down here I'm worried about getting it up here Satan puts the virus then where does it go don't go down here goes up here in a Christian can't get in the can't get the soul can't bother the soul of an individual but he sure can't get in that brain but see we're coming though to a placing or adoption where we're brother Brahim said Jesus didn't didn't in other words he didn't have to get up every morning and say I got to be God I gotta act like God I'm Jesus I got act like him no he just acted this life out that's the same way with you and I don't make yourself odd if you walk like this you'll automatically be on to the world were the artist people that ever lived on the face of the earth thank God they call Jesus the devil they did remember I called him belzebub you know why cuz he didn't come the way they thought he should come they didn't come he didn't come the way that they came because he they had a religion they had a covering they had a denominational idea that was different from what God or Jesus Christ so the journey of Ruth journey of Abraham has four parts justifications that case of baptism Holy Ghost and placing or adoption and then we looked at the four combat beasts the lion ox man and eagle now look you and I are in the Eagle anointing but that doesn't mean that the lineart Sandman is not there that's that just shows us the whole complete plan of redemption the whole complete plan of us nobody got that we still need the bonus of the line brother Brown said and he said that same that ox was in what the Dark Ages he said the same spirit they had to make it through that dark ages now watch this he said that same spirit they had that sent them into the lion's den and was able to take that spirit of the age you have to use every day to get through your day you have to use that what sacrificial ox anointing some I've been in this message for 40 years same and then the intelligence of the man and then the Eagle anointing is where it goes up higher so we can see these things in the Bible and see these things in your walk of your life that you can say that happened to me that's my journey that's my part of life so let's go on up a little bit more to Ruth we knew that the four characters in Ruth because I want you to keep going back to Ruth a little bit just scroll it up to the next next slide there please where Ruth we you had Naomi which was the type of the old Jewish church and we saw all this or four top of the denominational Church because remember she was with Naomi but she decided to go back all right she didn't want to take a further one of the word you're gonna see somebody else do the same thing in Esther Ruth there's your Gentile bride because remember everything she done was service servant she listened she listened to Naomi she listened to that old Jewish Church because it old Jewish Church knew what she knew the ways of the Jews Ruth did not she wasn't married long force for her husband's died so she couldn't learn so she had to learn from mama churches all right everybody got that and then Boaz absolutely topped Christ and we saw all the things that happened there so now let's go to the book of Esther we're not going to deal with the Book of Numbers I still think it's just a beautiful picture though talking about the Book of Numbers and Joshua about how that two tribes and a half tribe stayed on one side of Jordan and they and then the other half tribe went across and then they were placed over there it's just that to me it's just a beautiful beautiful journey all right so let's get this straight before we get started we'll start right here we're going to go verse by verse up until probably the second chapter and then we'll stop right there so we won't be very long now remember as we go through the book of Esther the book of Esther the name of God doesn't occur one time all right but in no other book I'm reading the commentary of Scofield but in no other book of the Bible is His Providence more conspicuous why because you got a girl that said you but she's not letting everybody know that but then you've got a king that's king over I'm talking about maybe two-thirds of the whole landmass of the world he's the king over all right and there's this guy comes in named Haman and he's wanting to kill all the Jews he doesn't know Hadassah or Esther is Jew yet that revealed that to him yet so he just claimed he just says hey Haman Haman paints such a bad picture the guy says okay get rid of them and then extra finds out Mordechai finds out extra finds out about it and they're like in total distress because they're fixing to get destroyed this Kings got armies by the millions right so here's the story same thing with you and now this world looks pretty bleak but you know what the only settlement salvation and saving grace is through the bride of Jesus Christ I'm sorry but I didn't play this thing out God did and this is the way it is all right the only salvation is is through a five fold ministry that are born again that preaches the Word of God to you and you respond and receive it and then act on it that's just the way it is I love it that way cuz it's simple that's real simple but after then we're going to look at the king king of Soros I looked at we looked up the definition of his name and there is not one it's just a question mark if you look in your Hebrew lexicon it's just a question mark they don't even know where this guy he's the greatest King and ever lived but they don't know him by name hello somebody okay but we do so the king is the king Esther is the type of the bride vastaa is a type of the old denominational Church and Mordecai we know even more to come means little man so he will be the Prophet that's going to be in the background and he's going to be telling the ride our Esther what to do right there I got that say man wake up I hope we start having a revival of staying awake I'm telling ya it's just a charge to see everybody back in church it is a charge to me but some people you know I preached on revival the other day I was telling them downstairs you know it's gonna say it's sad because it's an individual revival it's not one it's not the whole church is gonna sure we're all happy to be here but you're gonna fall in a revival of your own and we see it more now social distancing and they want you to stay away from everybody well you can have your own revival Amen you can have a one-man revival or one sister revival because God never promised anything about him distancing himself from you amen so he'll be right there with you but we see that Haman when Haman comes in it's going to be interesting even the lineage of these people I went through a lot of the history on this and that's why I don't want to bore you but it's a beautiful picture to me you can read it for yourself or you can look up some of these words some of the words are just so fitting for the day and and the King even a source he has no meaning to his name we look at Esther we know that her name original her name was Hadassah because that's her Jewish name and then her name had to be changed to Esther I love somebody that style we know last time means beautiful backs they what nothing she's a pretty church John admired her in revelations chapter 17 and man we'll get into that right here real quick and then Mordecai means little man about five six and Haman is a direct descendant if you take his lineage back he's from the Amalekites what God say to do the Amalekites kill them all amen because what did what did Emily do they wouldn't let Israel pass through the land and God said no I gotta know more these people they're not even going to be entered into the lineage of of the righteous but they got in the lineage of this guy named Haman so we'll get to it and just the second fuel mine we'll go through the first chapter set the stage so now watch the story continues as Jerusalem was dispersed right before this time and a mere remnant went to Jerusalem this certain amount went to Jerusalem but a lot of them stayed because they were lazing and here's the the commentary says the mass of the nation preferred the easy and lucrative life under the Persian rule that's not a lot layout to see a lot of a state and Laodicea where we live here but we're gonna see though that God didn't forsake them just like God's not gonna forsake us he puts all these players right in to the to the world not of the world but in the world he puts Esther and Mordecai all these different ones that you're gonna see he puts them in there with the Jews basically to save them because that they still have every year it's called the day of Purim and and they celebrate in Israel that they appear iam is the day it's kinda like our Independence Day that's the day that they celebrate because they would have been wiped out on that day there was a battle and if they hadn't defended their self they would have been wiped out but you know what God's not gonna let them get wiped out just like the bride you're gonna see us and we're it we're this great big number and then we're gonna dwindle down a little bit and all these different things are gonna happen but you know what it doesn't matter if it comes down to one God's gonna have a bride one um average one you can decide whether it's you or not so let's go now through the book of Esther and let's remember Esther types the bride the king is going to he's the greatest King that ever lived at that moment King the source then you've got backstop which is his wife at the time of the story got it she's the queen she's the first one then we're gonna see a guy named Mordecai come in a little bit later but watch how this sets up now it came to pass in the days of a source that is a source which range from India alright go look in your map all the way India is a close to China all the way to Ethiopia which is over there in Africa is in the top of Ethiopia so it was all that Kingdom all across the Middle East Middle East and all the way over into India over a hundred and seven twenty seven provinces so this King was not just a king that was sitting on a throne and he had three or four subjects no this guy had we're gonna see he's got Chamberlain he's got he's got people that are and actually what what gets me is is he's got princes and Chamberlain's and this seven of them seven is so prevalent in this scripture that you it's just not odd it's God God did this God wrote this God made this come to pass alright so now let's watch these that in those days when the king of Saurus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in Shushan the palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all the princes and his servants so it's in the third year of his reign alright third year of his reign the power of Persia Medea the nobles and princes of the provinces being performed in other words he said I'm gonna have this feast and I'm going to bring all my noble people in all the people of renown I'm going to bring them in and we're gonna have this feast and what does the feast do that mean you eat so what am I saying the king told us if you want to have a feast we're gonna have one on Wednesday night at 7 o'clock we're gonna have one Sunday morning at 10:00 and Sunday morning at 2:00 whether you sleep through them or not but that's what the Kings saying he's look I want to show you I want to show you what I got King Jesus wants to show you what he's got he's not a bragger though we brag on him but he's not a bragger he wants to show you what you already got he wants to bring you into this Kingdom when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom is that not what he's doing now he's showing us the riches of his kingdom by what by Scripture and by somebody by revelation bringing something to you even by reading the wonderful Psalm that you read today that was perfect for the time when he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days even 104 score 160 days that's almost half a year and when these days were expired the King made a feast unto all the people now not just the dignitaries now everybody laity the one that you may think you're a fingernail I'm a dorm out in the house of God God doesn't forget you he made a feast unto all the people that were present and sheesh on the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace seven church ages he's called the great and the small to this feast where were white green blue hangings fashioned with cords of fine linen and purple silver rings pillars of marble the beds were of gold silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black and marble this wasn't just a plain meeting and when they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another aren't you a vessel of gold aren't you diverse one from the other aren't you different a little bit different diverse one from another and royal wine what he's going to fill these vessels he's going to fill these diverse vessels with the Holy Ghost or with the wine royal wine in abundance not just give you a little dribble no you're gonna drink - you're drunk my brother Joel said get drunk on the Holy Ghost one time it'll be a lot different than getting drunk all the way and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure so the King has invited everyone to this great feast not a person left out he's invited everybody but he had a queen at the time and this Queen at the time decided to have her own denomination and bash die now beautiful she wasn't ugly she's beautiful oh nice to look upon the king the king at one time probably loved her but it's what she did it's what caused him to turn away from her and also Vashti the Queen made a feast room for the churches in the royal house which belong to king of source in other words she went right in and said I don't want to have anything to do with your feast I'm quoting brother Branham actually I don't have anything to do with your feast I'm gonna have my own I don't like what you're doing in other words I'm gonna do it my way but watch on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with one he commanded now here is seven people may man Vista harbona Victor a began a bagasse de zefr and look at number seven carcass Matthew 24 28 that's where the carcass is there's Willy Eagle to be gether funny that it's number 7 not 4 3 6 7 and they were 7 Chamberlain's or eunuchs that served in the presence of a source the king in other words they had no other work about them except the king got it now carcass if you look at the word carcass it means the covering of a lamb Wow how about that but now what he done is he commanded these people that served in the presence of a sorcerer King to bring vast on now he's telling these seven people I want to see my wife to bring vast I'm the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty he was getting ready to present her to the world Baptist Methodist Pentecostal randomise if you're not born again whatever you want to say we can become one of the biggest denominations in the world now we got a headquarters to bring by style the Queen before the King now what to do he didn't want at that time he still wanted to use that Queen he wanted her to be queen and he wanted everybody to see her but what happened show her beauty for she was fair to look on but the Queen bashed I refused refused to come at the Kings commandment look by his minister he preached the word through them seven but actually him saying it but by his Chamberlain's they brought the message to Vashta and said the key wants to see you and bashed I says don't want to see him brother Brown said that's the same way the denominations have done that's the same way we can do we can refuse the prophet of God said a further 'men of the word they refused the further one of the word they didn't want to come to the King anymore so what happened now watch but Queen Vashti I refused to come at the Kings commandment by his Chamberlain Chamberlain's therefore was the King very wroth and his anger burned in him now he was angry look you don't refuse a king naturally that's death you refuse a king in the natural world back then and you'd they just killed you but watch what happens then the king said to the wise men which knew the times in other words they were updated on the revelation for so was the Kings manner toward all that new law and judgment and the next to him was watch these are the Kings messengers princes and there's seven of them and the next unto him was carshena shet are admah the Tarshish meh res Barcena and ma'am you can now ma'am you can is the last one and ma'am you can means faithful now watch these are seven princes of Persia and media which saw the Kings face in other words they they were that close to the king but now watch what happens because he says what shall we do into the Queen Vashti according to the law because she has not performed the commandment of the king of sorts by the chin in other words we can't just let this go on we can't just let this happen there's got to be some kind of repercussion because you can't turn God down and there be no repercussion everybody okay leg up maybe we want to have like a movie or something Entertainment folks that's all we're in we just want somebody to entertain us this is pretty entertaining to me how that always happened 4,000 years ago and I can sit here and put myself and every bit of this if you want to be identified in the word then all you gotta do is look look that's your identification what shall we do into the Queen bash now according to law because remember you know God can't work outside his law he can't just make up a word his word is 66 books of the Bible he's got to condemn her by the word amen the denominations had to be condemned by the Word of God not by God just saying I don't like him anymore no they had to do something to cause his law to come into effect and there's what the repercussion comes from thereby okay with that with just a few more minutes and then won't stop so she refused and he's like we got to do something what are you seven men decide and think we ought to do look at verse 16 also his name means dignified now who spoke the seventh guy the seventh man comes up with an idea the seventh man gets a revelation because remember they speak for the King in all of the matters so this seventh man the Lord answered before the king and the princes vast time the Queen hath not done wrong to the King only in other words she's condemned the whole world not just a feint to clean the king because watch what happens but also to all the princes into all the people that are in the provinces of King a source in other words all true Christendom this denominational ideas popped up that we don't have to do what God tells us to do we don't have to do what the game tells us to do something's got to come about because then everybody else is going to just do what they want to do they meant no headship we must have headship that's why that seventh man watch what he's fixing to say he's fixing to lay it out just like brother Branham laid it out watch the message of the hour in verse 17 through 22 that's why number seven spoke for this deed of the Queen now what is a queen shall come abroad unto all churches women or churches right in other words this father son Holy Ghost baptism is going to come out and I see and it's going to go into every woman so that they shall despise their headship in their eyes that don't make it right but in their eyes they're going to despise their headship when it shall be reported in other words when the report goes out the church is the women are going to say well if you don't have to cut your thumb if you I can cut your iron you don't have to do what God said I don't have to do what he says he's the king of source commanded by styler queen to be brought in before him but she came not in other words she refused and set up a denomination likewise what shall the ladies churches of Persia Medea say this day into all the Kings princes which have heard of the deed of the Queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath nobody got that but I watch this is memucan this is the dignified God this is another number 7 guy that has more revelation obviously than the rest of them cuz rest of them are probably just sitting there shaking their head but this guy's standing up and said look this is what would you do if it please the King let there go a royal commandment from him Bible and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and Medes that it be not altered can't change the Word of God that vast I come no more before the king in other words he's cutting her off and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she brother branham comes in and he comes into the denominational world what happens they don't want him oh yeah they do for a little while for all the the healings and all that stuff but then they start going no we don't we don't want that anymore so God says okay brother Adam here's your real message it's to a group of people that will accept you there's an Esther getting ready to come on the scene that she's going to do exactly what you tell her to do I'm gonna send her a little prophet a little uncle a little guy a razor and then we're gonna present Esther to the king listen brother branham he's not God but he did help us get dressed hey man he helped not just physically he helps us get dressed so that we can be in the King's Chamber not just be somebody out in another palace will read that when we get on into the get on into here but look that vast I come no more before in other words cut her off take all over everything away from her that I gave her and that's what God did he threw her in the bed of adultery remember the scripture and let the King give her royal estate unto another that is better than she now this is mammy Ken this is the number seven guy and when the Kings decree which he shall make shall be published eleven hundred sermons published and send it to the whole world for it is great I like that little parenthesis for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honor both the great and small what you doing when the prophet of God preached he preached headship headship headship headship it has to start with God but then it has to go to the home look and the saying please the king and the princess and the King did according to the words of mammy Ken for he sent letters 1100 em all over the world into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language and these 1100 sermons not been put in every language almost in the world and it was the words of memucan that spoken but it was the King back in the month that's the same way what happened to spread the message and every people after their language that every man looks Chabert rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people the headship of God was restored under William branham's ministry no doubt there's no doubt of that because you lose your headship when you turn against God when you decide you're gonna do something contrary to the Word of God you lose your headship you come out from under that's why brother Ram talks about when you cut your hair women when you cut your hair you've come out from another headship of your of your husband se mueve you cut yourself off with God as bashed I did she decided just like Ruth decided but she made the wrong decision so here we are backs I decided to just say I'm gonna have my own feast I'm gonna have my own church and you look in revelations 3 14 15 16 17 down to that where's Christ outside the church trying to get back in cuz bashed I had shut him out and kicked him out of his own house and locked the door but you know what he said if any man will hear my voice hear my voice and open the door I will come in and sup with him we're fixing to see this this hears musicians come let's stand to our feet here's this King now in a quandary we're gonna look at next Sunday he's in a quandary he has no wife anymore Kings gotta have a wife Kings got to have a queen he now he's cut this one off and you know what under the laws of the Medes and Persians once the law is written we're going to see in a few minutes of our next week once the law is written it cannot it cannot be altered it cannot be changed or it cannot be stricken out same way with the Word of God once it's written it can't be changed it can't be your own idea best I cannot be your idea but now we see a king but now watch here's this great king and he's very very intelligent he's got these princes over here he's got one guy that give him this idea that to make 1100 sermons and send this little guy named Mordecai and you've got the Chamberlain's over here you've got carcass and all the different ones that are sitting and hit there you say what are you saying by the way the fivefold ministry does not tell god what to do but they're right there with him and through his through what through what the king what what ma'am you can done ma'am you can call it the revelation that was inside that Kings head because the King needed a queen the king had to have a queen he couldn't have this one and he couldn't let the situation go on like it was but he couldn't change the law he couldn't just say no he just took it just took all of her power away from her and put her out there somewhere and said okay you can have your church you can have you denomination I'm just not gonna be out there I'm going to find me a bride that will dress right there like right and every time I call she'll answer didn't know what to Brian you know what you want amen god bless you that's the first stage of the Esther then I hope you enjoyed it but it's it's just something that thrills my heart to know that these people go through these things and everything everything this has been written this Bible's been written for 1,500 years or longer compiled in just about 500 years but he's still been written the book of Esther was written a long time ago but compiled several you know five hundred years ago but it's still been there to read and people have been joined it and it was a wonderful story but you and I have had a mordecai to come and bring us the love letter bring us to underline the allegory the whatever you want to call it but here's you got your surface and you've got your actors playing out but you see underneath that that's me and you look at the threes in the sevens and why does the seventh guy speak and wives Guylaine carcass and why you got a king and why you got one that you know refused herself to the king just like the in the end time that's just the way it is we're looking at the listen those people are dead and gone their bodies are somewhere in this earth but it's their dust their soul lives on somewhere but you and I are alive and when we read that we see ourselves as Esther we did see ourselves as best at one time when I was out in the world I refused a lot of things of God I don't know if you did or not but I did but then what did God do because it I gotta find a bride I gotta find a bride and I gotta send the preachers I gotta send seven Church ages I gotta send seven messengers in those seven churches and then they're gonna do exactly what my my thoughts are gonna be projected through those people and they're gonna find me a bride and guess what there's a little man named Mordecai walks in right there to seventh he walks right in and you'll see in a minute it'll be in the seventh year of the Kings reign you know this happens in the third year but he's gonna walk in on about the seventh year of the Kings reign so well

devil got ahold of me when I was young and I probably didn't serve the Lord for fifty or sixty years she said but I heard about this meeting that this little man about that tall was gonna preach and she said I just thought I'd go and see what's going on I didn't really want know that religion stuff or none of that Salvation there none of that water baptism or nothing like that and I I just I just went because my friend will my boyfriend wanted to go where my girlfriend wanted to go well you know what he done after 92 years it changed her eternal destination it didn't changed that she went to the grave that's okay but when brother ran I'm sorry she's an 18 year old girl I'll bet you when she got saved she didn't act 92 especially for a little while but she went on with the Lord though but here but but her eternal destination was changed because of one service can water baptism do it sure it's the promise that if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you're worried about having the Holy Ghost go to the water started a started a didn't go to me didn't go to see but you know what even if you started a and find out you still got the Holy Ghost you still got an a B C you still got to go
