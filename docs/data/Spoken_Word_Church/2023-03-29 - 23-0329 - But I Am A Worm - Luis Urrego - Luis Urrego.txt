22. this evening Psalms chapter 22. appreciate that song sister Lily enjoyed that I was looking over there at the uh you know I made that those calendars back in December now I didn't know when Esther was going to get married so so that's why Esther was on the uh on the calendar there I was like I looked at it I was like oh you know we're gonna miss her it won't be the same but but we're just trusting that she will uh she'll have a wonderful life from here on out amen a new a new stage in life amen and you a new a new era or a new time in her life amen Psalms chapter 22. let's start at verse one it says my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou hears not and in the ninth season and I'm not silent but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabitants the Praises of Israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst delivered them they Cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded but I am a worm and no man a reproach of man and despised of the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighteth in him does that sound like a scripture you've read somewhere else but Thou Art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts I was cast upon thee from the womb Thou Art my God from my mother's belly last verse here be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help praise the Lord you may be seated this evening amen amen I want to I want to take a little topic tonight and I want to call it but I am a worm and I'm taking it from verse six and uh I did a Sunday school lesson about this a couple of years ago where I talked about where I talked about Jesus being a worm so we're kind of revisiting this but I I wanna I wanna I wanna I know there was a lot of there were there weren't a lot of people that there at the time that are here tonight and there's some new ones listening in so I figure since being at it's Easter time we we will revisit this but I want to take a look at uh at different aspects of Psalms chapter 22 because when we look at Psalms chapter 22 here it correlates perfectly with the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ we know that it was David amen it was Christ speaking through David amen when David was saying these things even at that time at this time from According to the history and the things that I that I that I looked at there was no such thing as a crucifixion as punishment of crucifixion at the time that didn't come until years later and the Romans were the ones who ended up perfecting that hence the reason why it was the Romans that crucified Jesus and so we see here David speaking about him and we know that David he had a lot of problems in life we know he was chased by by his by his brother Absalon I'm in his son Absalon and uh he had different things he was dethroned and and multiple things happened in his life but never do we see in the history of the things that David went through where he was actually pierced in his hands or pierced through his feet and and the different things that he says here and so we know that brother Brandon even said that he David was actually a prophet and so as he was speaking here because we can see here that this when we when we look at the beginning it says to the chief musician upon agile shehar a Psalm of David it was David amen speaking by inspiration whoever was writing this down panning this down was seeing something that was not even going to take place till years hundreds of years later and so we look at here it starts with my God my God why has Thou forsaken me and we know that this is exactly what Jesus said when he was upon the cross and he said Eli Eli sabatani which means my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he was actually quoting Psalms chapter 22. amen we might he might have been quoting and he might have been saying uh uh saying Psalms 22 in his head amen but if you read if you just take a look at this whole chapter I mean it speaks almost as as more detailed about the crucifixion of Christ than even the gospels do so amen because of the things that he was suffering and yet you think that it was David but we know David was having troubles but it was it wasn't David it was David amen experiencing or seeing someone amen that was uh that was experiencing this and we know that it was Christ amen and he says my God my God why has Thou forsaken me why are thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring amen you can imagine Jesus Christ amen everybody had forsaken him at that time I mean Judas forsook him the disciples forsook him everybody had forsaken him and so now he's he's probably in his mind he's when Jesus is there dine upon the cross he's probably thinking also you Lord you forsaking me you see because he we know that Jesus was God but we know that that that he also was suffering as a human as well as a son to be an example for us you see and so he's he's crying out and he's saying my God my God why has Thou forsaken me because he's he knew that the Lord was always with him I mean and he didn't do nothing unless the father showed him first so we knew that that that God was always with him the father was always with him but here comes this instance where he is he's abandoning him and it's because Jesus became sin for us amen he wasn't a sinner [Laughter] he became sin for us amen and anything that that that is sinful amen God can't look at sin God can't can't see that God can't see that and therefore that's one of the reasons why amen he felt that his God was forsaken him because he was taking your sin and my sin remember as the song goes when he was on the cross I was on his mind and so it takes us back to predestination amen because it was God Amen he he foreknew you even before the foundation of the world right right so he for news amen and even and when he was dying on the cross amen he was doing it not for himself he was doing it for you and me and for and the Bible says that that for for many as would receive him to them gave me power to become the sons of God Amen and so he continues saying here David continue saying here oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou here is not can you imagine amen getting to a point where God is not hearing you anymore where you were used to at one point in time God you would pray God would hear you amen Lazarus come forth amen but here is an instance where Jesus remember this is Jesus fulfilling this Jesus comes to a point where he was saying my God why has thou forsaken me why don't you hear me and you know sometimes we get to a point like that David was was in situations like that you see where it feels like the Lord's not hearing our prayers it feels like those dry moments in our life like where is God where is where where is he I've been serving him for 30 40 years I go to church I pay my tithes I do what I'm supposed to do I'm nice to everybody I smile I shake I don't fall asleep at church I do everything that is great and I feel like God is not hearing me yep if it happened to Jesus how much more us you see but see God has a reason why he allows those things for in our lives amen because he knows he can get something better out of that amen again as I know I've been saying it lately a lot and God cannot come right as sometimes he might sometimes he will but not every time you call on to him that he he he he has to do it right there and then amen amen because we don't learn patience that way we don't learn how to wait and we don't learn Amen to trust in him to trust in his word oh it's hard don't you think it was hard for Jesus don't you think it was hard for David when he was whatever he was expressing here whatever was going on in his life so many some say that this was during the time when maybe Absalom was chasing him I don't know but obviously we know that David went through some difficult times in his life where he felt like God was not hearing him and how much more us it feels like God but he promised that he would never leave us nor forsake us amen so if he's if he promised that he would never leave us nor forsake us then that means he that he is listening to your prayer he just wants to answer it in his time praise the Lord Jesus oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou here is not and in the night season and then and am not silent verse 3 but Thou Art holy oh that thou inhabitants the Praises of Israel amen so even though God was not hearing David amen he still goes ahead and worships him do you inhabit the Praises Lord Jesus Oh I may not have it right now I may not get it right at this very moment but Lord I praise you anyhow Lord you inhabit my Praises you you you deserve all my praise and all my glory amen in your time lord Jesus praise the Lord but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabitants the Praises of Israel our fathers trusted indeed verse 4 they trusted and thou didst deliver them they Cried unto thee and were delivered he's bringing now David speaking about the things that God had done for them in the past and were delivered they trusted indeed and were not confounded amen you will not be confounded when you put your whole trust in the Lord amen because he will never let you down young people he won't ever let you down amen when you get to a point in life amen where it's confusion and I know some of you are in ages where it's it's confusing where should I do what should I what should I believe what should I amen stay with what you what what you know what you have learned already stay with that and maybe maybe you may not understand it fully but stay with it and eventually eventually it will come to fruition right keep adding more more water on top of that and what is water water is the word keep adding more word to that word that you already heard that rhymes almost but keep adding more word to that word that you already heard and eventually that word is gonna bring something amen a reality a true experience in your life amen amen oh I know it's confusing yeah I was I was 13 at one time I was 14. I was 15 I was 16. right it's a bit confusing it's it's times of confusion I understand many changes and different things taking place but God promised amen that he would lead us and guide us unto all truth just stay with what you already have amen stay with what you already have and just move on with that and then let God just keep feeding that and let God Amen that will continue to grow it's just like a tree amen a tree ain't gonna grow any other way unless you give it water and and sunlight give it water and sunlight give it word and church word in church word in church eventually you will grow eventually you will get to a point amen word on top of word and I always say you know that that that that you know we all need showers right we all need to take a shower right so when you need when you take a shower I hope that you use soap because you know you can take a shower with just water and really you don't really come out really that clean you still come out greasy [Laughter] right I'm just I'm just being honest you need to have some soap some some some some lathering up I always say that soap is kind of like the fivefold ministry amen kind of scrub you down a little bit but you still need that water in there to gonna go ahead and wash that out right and the soap won't work unless there's water the soap won't work unless there's there's there's there's there's there's there's there's there's word there right so this is not the soap that does it just the soap it needs the water as well in order to be to get fully clean right I like that I like using that analogy hey man so we need a five-fold Ministry amen we need the word amen and they both work together to help you get to a point where where you need to get to perfect the bride Amen to perfect his people to clean you up amen that's a good shower right there man uh when I'm in Nicaragua or Honduras say man and that's it you know it's sweaty it's hot in those places I gotta have me some soap ain't that right Nyla I gotta have me some so I gotta have me some shampoo right yeah that's when you that's when you feel clean all right all right let's get back to this got you all smiling there for a moment so David continues here our fathers trusted indeed they trusted and thou did US delivered them verse five they Cried unto them were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded now this is where I want to get to Amen to verse six and he says here something very strange and remember this is David this is Christ speaking through David right and he says here he says but I am a worm and no man what is he talking about amen but I am a worm you know why didn't he say we know that that a worm is is the lowest uh it's one of the lowest little creatures that that you could possibly you know a little earthworm right you see him probably on the side of the road dead sometimes after a rain you know they're and they harden up and stuff and they get it's nasty but it's the lowest of the lowest but why did did God why did David not say there I I you know but I am a roach I mean the roaches are just as nasty I mean I don't like roaches where I am something else I am I am I'm this but he he said here I am a worm now when he says this here he's not speaking about a worm like you and me think a worm is right so so so this is where I want to get it the brothers could bring up the uh the the my my my thing here my connection I got some slides here I wanna show maybe we can try again all right let me try this one here not showing how about this right here all right something's coming up all right okay can you see that all right okay all right so in Matthew chapter 27 verse verse 46 we see there that and Jesus and this is when Jesus was dying and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying that is to say my God my God why has Thou forsaken me and so we've we're there at verse six now brother Branham says this he says this and look the scripture had said that was going to happen exactly word by word the way it was even David hundreds of years before that about 800 years cried the very same thing that he said on the cross all right and no doubt that in the temple that morning think about this right here no doubt that in the temple that morning they might have sang that same song Psalms chapter 22 my God my God why has Thou forsaken me in the temple singing about it and the god that they claimed they served they were crucifying think about that if you're going to be doing you can be doing a service for God and thinking that you uh are are are you know just doing what you're supposed to do in reality it not be the will of God remember brother Brandon said you know doing God of service without it being his will we can be so busy for God sometimes and then it not really be his will amen so we see that this scripture is talking about Christ and and and so that's the question we were asking why does he call himself a a worm amen now in in Job chapter 25 verse 3 it says this is there any number of in of his armies and upon whom doth not his light arise how then can man be justified with God or how can he be clean that is born of a woman behold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight says here how much less man that that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm so they're referring to that that worm here and it's interesting that it's also verse six as well just like verse 6 and Psalms chapter 22. now the word the word scarlet is used several times in the scriptures amen uh for example we know about the Scarlet thread that that that that that the um Rahab brought down when when when she uh when the children of Israel were to take the the Jericho and so uh that speaks of scarlet and so when you ever whenever you look at that word scarlet in the Hebrew lexicon the word or the word Crimson right which rep which means red it's the word Shani or Shani which means this Scarlet Crimson properly it says properly the insect caucus alysses which is the dried body of the female yielding coloring matter from which has made the dye used for cloth to color crimson Scarlet or Crimson all right so it's referring to a a worm and an animal that word where whenever you see it the meaning of the word scarlet goes hand in hand with the meaning of the word Crimson in the Hebrew lexicon and you see this here in Isaiah chapter 1 verse 8 18 which says come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool praise the Lord Jesus amen thank God Amen that our sins that they're not just covered they're washed they're done away with if you've truly repented of your sins if you've truly asked God to forgive me he just doesn't put a covering over because when there's a covering over something if I put a covering over this Pulpit that doesn't mean the pulpit is not there anymore the pulpit is still there it's just under a covering right but when God Amen takes care of your sins he eradicates them completely amen so what that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ amen we know that it's the literal blood wouldn't be able to do anything for you right but we know it's the spirit behind the under the under the blood amen that that that's what does the power praise the Lord Brother Brandon said that you can have the the blood of Jesus Christ a gallon of blood here and just pour it all over you of the the literal blood of Jesus Christ and as and as reverently and as as as we would try to make sure it won't spill but you can go ahead and pour that on you and it wouldn't do anything for you it's the spirit amen behind under that blood that cover that not just covers but takes away your sin eradicates your sin so that word there is Scarlet in the in in in Isaiah is the word Tola and it and and and and watch what this word means it means worms scar Scarlet stuff Crimson worm it goes back and it says the female caucus alysses Scarlet stuff Crimson Scarlet the dye made from the dried body of the female of the worm caucus alysses a worm maggot worm grub the worm caucus alysses so that's very interesting that that is the same word that is referring back to Psalms chapter 22 verse 6 where David says I am a worm but we know that it was Christ speaking through David right praise the Lord Jesus so this word Tola is the same word used for the word or the word worm in Exodus chapter 16 when they were talking about that if they left the Manna out you know too long if bread worms is the same word there Tola um and made it stink so the general Hebrew word in the Bible for worm is Rima which means a maggot or a common Worm but the word that was used in Psalms chapter 22 to describe Jesus was Tola or Tola off which is the same word in Hebrew for the word Crimson or Scarlet amen trying to go so trying to go a little quicker here so are you are you all following me yeah all right all right so this is very interesting because when a couple of years ago when I was looking into this um I was looking actually at the token and then I got into looking into it and then I got into reading this and then and then I started looking into that why why is it that he says I'm a worm and got to look into it and here we are but but I believe saints that that God doesn't put things in the word just to put him there and if you truly believe that the word of God is inspired by God then they're there for a purpose they have a purpose and as I said God said what he said and he meant what he said right they're there for a reason it's just up to you and me Amen to take and dig into them and see what he meant right amen praise the Lord because it's all beneficial for us it's all beneficial for us so in looking at this at this at this worm it's it's interesting I know you you probably some of you can't read that text there but I'll just read it for you the the dry bodies of the females uh uh uh of a scale insect or the caucus alysses uh Allied to the coquine insect and found on several species of Oak near the Mediterranean and old and old Israel so this worm that David is referring to here is is found in Israel in those Mediterranean areas in ancient days the dead bodies of the female crimson worms were scraped from the tree and I'm going to show you some pictures here in just a moment dried and then ground into a powder that was used to dye their cloth and garments as Scarlet or red color they're about the size of a little pea that's how that's how big these are and when the crushed worm was also used to make medicine that helps the heart beat smoothly think about that very interesting and then later on we're going to see that their bodies turn into a white wax that's used to make shellac which is a preservative of wood so there's the picture right there of that of that worm right there the caucus elysius or the Scarlet worm in other words now some of these they're a little older but uh you can see they're not 4K or HD all right this right here this is a an older picture that this is a uh from the temple Institute they're in Israel they were showing a demonstration of this little worm and and and and and he's going to show uh he's take he take he's got boiled water here and he's take he takes one little worm one little worm like that one of those little pea-sized worms and he and he dissolves it inside the and you see how red it's turning all right now remember what represents red crimson the blood right and you see and that's just one one little one little worm that does that right there yeah and they would use that this is an example of some some thread that they that they've died with that with that worm you can go on YouTube right now and you can search uh videos of people actually dying uh using this little worm and dying threads and things with with the dial this little worm this was the same dye that the priests used to use to dye their their garments in the Old Testament and also the the the coverings that were used for the Tabernacle as well so and this is right here this is they're they're going out and Gathering the little worm out there and they're taking it and and it and it latches onto the tree so it kind of looks like it's part of the tree but that actually has a representation and so this is what it this is what it looks like right now those or those right there those actually have eggs under them and so they uh their babies under there and so they they formed this hard shell and so this is right here this is when after they have ripped them off the tree and you can see those are eggs inside and there's a little closer shot with them now they take these this right here they crush them and then they they color dye they they use it for for coloring all right so what does what does all this talking about worms have to do with Jesus and Easter all right he says here but I am a worm and no man a reproach of man and despised of the people amen many many people we know despise Jesus Christ many people despise Jesus Christ today you know they don't even want to hear his name on TV and I've I've watched little clips of of newscasts where where where uh compilations of newscasts like Fox News and CNN and different things and there's somebody there talking about Jesus and how with their thanking Jesus for this that or the other and as soon as as soon as they they cut the feet off multiple times has happened they they they cut the feet off you can't tell me that's coincidence they don't want to hear the word of the word Jesus they don't want they don't want Christianity to be propagated they do anything to stop it and so um I think lately uh I don't I don't I haven't looked too much into it but in in Israel they're they're saying that they don't even want people to preach Jesus there in Israel so I don't I don't know how how where that's going to go but we just know that the world is heading to a place where they don't even want to hear they don't want to hear anything that you have to say about God anything about God no there's a people there's going to be faithful no matter what the word no what the world or how the world goes there is a people that's going to stay faithful to the word I'm not ashamed of this gospel you don't need to be ashamed of the word you don't need to be ashamed of the Gospel amen if this gospel amen will cause me to to to to go to my death will so be it my Lord did it for me amen why could not do it for him praise the Lord amen if it causes me to to suffer persecution will so be it it's worth it amen amen much more worth it than living in in this world in this present condition so to many people Jesus was irrelevant at that time you know Isaiah said that he had no Beauty in him that we should desire there was nothing beautiful about Jesus amen he he even looked older than what he was amen and so that's why David amen he says I am a worm Jesus speaking I am a worm you know you could go by walking by these trees they're in Israel and you would probably notice that there was a worm there on that tree or a little grub something insignificant but yet has so much power because one little worm amen can do a lot it could die the pre the garments the the garments of the priests if people just realize how much how much power is in the in the word amen in the Lord all right let's go a little quicker so just real quick amen and I'll just kind of paraphrase this when when this worm it comes time for her to have babies what she does is she goes and attaches herself to this tree to a tree and make sure that she doesn't she is she cannot be moved she attaches herself to that tree this is according to to the things I've read so I've kind of put it here a little bit some of it she attaches herself to the tree and she has her babies She lays the eggs and and so when When She lays the eggs she she makes she puts on this covering this hard covering or this hard shell around herself that's why that's why we saw it and it looked hard and kind of white looking that's the shell it's a protection and so when the when when the babies hatch and the eggs hatch they need to eat something right so according to what according to what I was reading they actually eat off this this grub this worm because there's nowhere else for it she can't she can't go and get food for them and they have no way to eat they have to eat so they start eating off the mom think about where that is amen we feed off the body word Jesus said I am the bread of life right I am the true bread that comes out of Heaven amen and and and and we get fed amen what feeds me is the word I can't really fully get fed off of anything else amen what truly feeds me amen my real me is the word of God other things are interesting other things are nice amen but what truly feeds the true Christian or the True Believer is the word of God Amen we have nowhere else to go Peter said where else can I go you are the only one that has the words of eternal life we are here under this shell of protection amen where else can we do and so these babies are there eating and they feed off the body word of their mom right praise the Lord Jesus and so as they're feeding amen and they get to a point the mom knows that they the the they're growing so she has to let them go right before she lets them go she she immediately covers them with this with this Crimson goo and this Crimson goo is it's in order to protect them amen it's the Crimson goo that protects us amen [Laughter] praise the Lord amen she protects him with this Crimson die and that dye gets all over the tree and everything and I'll show you pictures here in just a moment of what that looks like but it's all over and that's when she dies and the little and the little and the little worms or the little the sons or the daughters and the daughters I mean they have a new life ready to move on right all right so here's here's the little tree there's there's the the worm again it attach itself once on the tree the Crimson worm then attaches itself to the tree it makes sure it's secure because the body of the worm will eventually be the shelter for the young which are born it is so strongly and permanently stuck to the wood that the shell cannot be removed without tearing its bodies completely apart and killing it her body turns into a shell for protection of her babies it was not the nails that held Our Savior to the cross it was love when the baby worms or larva hatch they stay under the shell not only does the mother's body give protection for the babies but it also provides them with food the babies feed on the living body of the mother all right so that's a picture I showed you all ago that those are the eggs that were that were inside that's the shell right there under the mother all right Matthew 26 26 27 says and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body all right hence the reason saints that I want you to look we're going to take communion this Sunday the importance of communion to a believer it's so so it's so great right partaking of communion because it's commemorating Amen what Jesus told us to do right it's not a suggestion Jesus says I suggest that you eat my body you know and and take eat my bread and drink my blood no he said take eat this is my body do this whenever you do it do it in remembrance of me right and then John 6 53 57 says then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whoso eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is me indeed and my blood is drinking deed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me now we know that Jesus is speaking there spiritually right eating off him is eating the word amen right we don't literally eat the body and the Flesh of Jesus Christ or drink his blood because we're not vampires and the Catholics amen they they believe in in trans trans I forget transubstestiation translation [Laughter] where they literally believe that the that the wafer that I used to take when I was in the Catholic Church my wife's taking it I know sister Anna Canard she's been she's been there they literally believe that that round wafer turns into the literal body of Jesus Christ and then when you're drinking the wine you're drinking the literal blood of Jesus Christ but we know that's not scriptural and we know that's not what Jesus was talking about so when we take communion where it's representations of his body representations of his blood right praise the Lord after just a few days of feeding on the living body of the mother the young worms grow and the mother dies it then secretes them so secretes that that that that Crimson blood uh Matthew 26 28 says for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins Romans 5 9 says much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him praise the Lord what does that look like that's that is right there that's when the mother has completely killed herself but in killing herself or in dying she's covering her little young and it's so much Crimson that falls out that that that that it that it stains the the the the tree amen don't it look like that praise the Lord Jesus amen thank God for his for the blood-stained cross amen thank God for that what he did for us amen there's another another one of the stains there and I believe that on the right is the little babies ready to do their part right but they're covered and they're stained with the mothers with their mother's Crimson wax crimson amen amen the Christian amen can't get can't go without the blood of Jesus Christ Christianity isn't Christianity if there's no blood I mean it was like that at the beginning in Genesis that had to be Bloodshed in order to cover Adam and Eve amen there has to be blood or even a man to cover you in this hour thank God that he did it once and for all he doesn't have to constantly die for you and me he did it once and that's enough yeah hey man and it's up to you if you go to him for that for forgiveness of your sins praise the Lord amen so we see that this is this is this is they use this this to for the priests garments and also the Tabernacle Matthew 12 40 says for as Jonas was three days and three nights on the whole the whole belly so shall the son of man for three days and three nights in the in the heart of the earth so this is very interesting right here on the morning of the fourth day the worm has pulled the head and tail together and is now in the shape of a heart on the tree but it is no longer crimson it is now wax which is white as snow they can still harvest the wax and use it to make shellac a preservative wood the resurrection of Jesus Christ which serves as a preservative of the message of the Cross amen we know that that without the resurrection there is no And so there's the white the white right there that's after three days after they it has turned red or she releases this red this redness turns into this white wax which we know what happened on the Resurrection Day on the third day right the Eighth Day a new beginning remember what Isaiah said though your sins be a Scarlet they shall be white as snow right praise the Lord Psalms chapter 22 amen I am a worm and no man does that make a little bit more sense to you I am a worm it's not just saying that I am then oh I'm just it's there for a reason praise the Lord Jesus there's the white the whiteness there of the of the and they use that and they take that and use it for wax amen Psalms 22 14 David continues saying here I am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint look what he says here my heart is like Wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels I don't think that that was there for just to be there and then in in the previous verses he talks about I am a worm Isaiah 1 18 come now let us reason together says the Lord though your sins be a Scarlet that's the word Shani they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson that's the word Tola they shall be as War so the two words aren't as they're on the same in the same verse praise the Lord also the Crimson worm is a very fragrant when it's crushed they say they say that there's an odor that comes up when when when they crush it and and you can go to YouTube and you can actually see people crushing the little worm and making dye out of this little worm Ephesians 5 1 tells us be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also has loved us and had given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor praise the Lord crushed worm was also used for medicine to help the heart beat smoothly amen but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed praise the Lord for that amen so in a sense that's another reason Jesus become a worm to be kind of abate hey man kind of a bait in order to to to do full Redemption amen I like this God needed to sink his teeth of anger into something his appetite of holy wrath needed to be fed but Jesus didn't want him to feed on us amen you know we we deserved hell we deserve punishment we each and every one of us deserve what Jesus suffered on this on the cross and more but I'm so thankful that he took it for us amen and so when we're looking at at Easter coming up amen just think about amen just think about the things he suffered for us amen and how I should have taken I should have been in that place and he was I was on I was on his mind amen the whole time he was he was on that tree the whole time he was on that cross God has a purpose with all scripture and so II Timothy 3 16 tells us all scripture is given by inspiration of God amen all scripture I think this is the last the last I want you to read with me Psalms 22 31 well I have it right here that's it's the last verse there of this chapter and it's interesting because uh just go home this is your homework go home read the whole chapter and there's other things there that you'll see that it's talking about the crucifixion of Jesus but look what it says in the last verse in verse 31 it says it says there they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this amen let's read the the I'm gonna read the the previous verse let me see here 22 um some Psalms 20 okay it's a seed Shall Serve him it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation amen So speaking of of the of the future right they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born a new birth that he hath done this and when you look at when you look at that word that there or that phrase that he hath done this when you read it in the in the original in the original Hebrew we're almost done but when you read it in the region of Hebrew is only one word and it's the word I saw which means finished complete and what did Jesus say there on the on the cross when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen it's complete Saints there is no excuse for you to carry your sin this afternoon it is done it's already done as the scripture as the song says we can be free from our from our condemnation we can be free from the guilt of sin because he's already taken it on the cross of Calvary for you he became a worm so that you don't become it praise the Lord Jesus amen I hope you loved I hope you you you you you learned something from there and take that with you you can look at it through it yourself and study it out but let's just think about these things as Easter's getting ready to come up and uh and uh let's just stand to our feet we're finishing up nice and early praise the Lord hey man let's just bow our heads as the musicians come I want to sing uh um um that song uh key of G um the blood will never lose its power I had I had the song here uh 319. let's just buy our heads if anybody has a need of prayer we're more than glad to pray with you amen but you asked the Lord there where you're at God is more than able amen if tonight anybody needs salvation or doesn't even know if they have the Holy Ghost
