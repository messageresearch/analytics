and uh back home uh for a minute for a second we're going be on the road again but um let's go ahead and turn over to Genesis 135-15 and um just take a little topic tonight prepared for his Pro prepared for the promises and uh before we read this let's just go into the word to the author Lord we're so grateful be to be able to gather around your word tonight Lord Jesus and Lord like our Prophet told us it's like look into the Sheep music and if we can just get into the the rhythm of what's laying here in the word and Lord if the conductor the spirit of the conductor can tell us what's what's laying here and what we're supposed to be doing we can just see how everything's supposed to unfold I pray God that you'll be with us tonight Lord just enter in enter into that Rhythm of the word Lord Jesus that enter into the rhythm of the the music for the sage Lord Jesus so that we know our we can find Our Place be with us tonight Lord we pray and you just bless this little service Lord here in the middle of the week and give us strength Lord God help us in the hour that we're living in Lord we pray in your name and uh so as we read this scripture just think about Abraham and all of the things that God had promised him and before before he could see all those promises come to pass he had to be completely separated from any unbelief from anything that was contrary to God's word so that he could see the promised son made manifest and uh so we'll read from verse 5 and it says and lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and Tents and the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a Strife between the Herdman of Abram's cattle and the her of Lot's cattle and the Canaanite and the perizzite dwell then in the land and Abram said unto lot let there not let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my Herdman and thy Herdman for we be Brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou wil take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that is well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the guard of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto Zoar then lot chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East and they separated themselves the one from the other Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot dwell dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and thy seed forever God bless you you may be seated the Lord out his Blessing to the reading of the word all you think about all the promises that are laying here in the in the in the Bible for us but if we can just separate ourselves from unbelief and just lay claim to God's word I I was preaching this this past Sunday on how God doesn't forget his promises that we've got a God that that when God makes a promise he he he he he's going to back it up and he's just trusting in us he's relying on us to take just take him at his word and and you see here where we've got a story of of Abraham and and and lot both having different desires a lot wanted to see you know a type of the carnal believer that wants to see how close they can get to the to to Sodom and gomorra and the the things of the world but Abraham Abraham uh once once he was separated from lot then he could be visited by melkisedek then melkisedek could come and break the bread and the wine with him and then he could unfold all of these Mysteries of the the the promised son and I I think today sure surely we can see that in our own lives how that uh when you truly are separated from all unbelief and see unbelief just drop away from you and you see it maybe like right away into the sunset then we've got a promise that the son of man will be manifest in our lives and we've got a promise that that man that that child that's that what we've been waiting on all these years will be manifest in our sight and brother Brandon would say he said our thought of God's word calling a total separation we only know this by as we read the word and see the word manifest and you know all all through the scripture is a story of how the word when the word is being preached the word actually will create a separation it separates it like it separated Abraham and lot it separates in in the very beginning in the beginning in Genesis 1:3 we find that God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from the darkness and how did he do it he did it by his spoken word so the word of God actually began to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning so does it remain even until this day and later on in this sermon brother ROM would explain that even even the day when we're in a meeting when the word is going forth it actually separates it separates the true and the false it separates it actually will cause your unbelief to begin dropping away the word of God when it's received in a penitent heart it's going to cause you to begin believing and begin it changes the way you think you see and in Genesis 1 chapter 2 or chapter 1: 2 to 4 it says the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved on the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and the and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness I think surely that we can see how that mirrors our own our own uh uh Christian experience how our life was all in chaos and then we heard the word of God and then that word took our life that was in chaos and darkness and actually begin to mold it and begin to separate us from the things of the world I you know just looking at if you can look back in your own experience maybe maybe you used to hang around with the wrong crowd and hang around with people that were smoking and vaping and drinking alcohol and and cussing like Sailors but then you heard the word and it be to it it caught your attention and begin to draw you away from that and so it separated you from that Old group of friends you know it it truly will separate you it makes you it makes you not want to hang around that anymore I I saw that even in my my children's life my Zach used to work out with some a group of fans and they weren't the best group of friends to have and but once he got saved he met one of them one time in the in the in the gas station parking lot and he's like I just can't hang around that person anymore why because the he heard the word of God and it and it separates you it it changes things and separ I thank God that God can take chaos and turn it into order now there's one way you can tell the difference between the devil doing something and and God doing something the devil is going to always be an author of chaos chaos and darkness where and confusion where you don't know what's going on and you're you're just what what what is wrong and what is Right wondering whether somebody's telling the truth or not that's what the the devil is the author of confusion that's one thing I always want to stand when I when I preach and when I when I declare what I believe I I want people to know where I stand and what I believe on things because because that's what God is all about that's what light is the the the God is the author of light and life and illumination and taking chaos and tearing down uh tearing down all those things that represent darkness and chaos and bringing order just like Babylon Babylon was the symbol of of confusion when all their their language was turned to where they couldn't understand each other's language that's the total opposite of God giving knowledge and understanding I I I love when you read the book of John John constantly says well we know we know we know over and over again he says we know because God brings understanding and and and and and Revelation and truth and order to the thing and so you can see how the word actually actually separates light and darkness and Chaos and Order it actually produces a separation and 2 Corinthians 4:6 Paul said for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of G of the glory of God and the face of Jesus Christ now there our new birth parallels what God did in the creation where he he took chaos and and Shone light the light of his word and and and brought order out of chaos and now he's doing Paul's saying he did the same thing with our hearts who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness our dark reprobate heart uh that didn't want nothing to do with God and God cused the light to shine to shine out of that Darkness to shine in our heart to give light of the knowledge of the glory of God and even in second Peter 1:19 now this is one of my favorite scriptures cuz Peter is talking about he's saying we we saw all these things I was there up on the mount Transfiguration when we heard a voice I was there when we saw so many wonderful things but he said but now we got a more sure word of Prophecy and what more sure word of Prophecy is that the light that as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts the the new birth that's what the new birth is the light of God's word to take that darkness and that chaotic old life and change you to separate you so that you ain't like you used to be now that's kind of the that's kind of the centerpiece of this message tonight is that we got to be separated that's what the new birth does that's what the Holiness of God does is it SE SE sanctification is another word for separated and when you're separated from the things of the world you don't want to go back to that anymore you're separated and you're cleaned up and you're like like a nerite in the old Old Testament you're you're separated from it and you're you've God has taken you and removed you from that to where your conscience has been cleaned out you don't want that anymore you don't want all that you don't want to look at that nastiness anymore you don't want to you don't want to drink those things you used to drink you don't want to smoke the things that you used to smoke you've been cleaned out and in every stage of your journey you got to be separated before God can do something in your life you want the new birth for first you got to be Sanctified in your soul and then God can manifest his promises to you you want to see the son of man manifested in your midst you got to be cleaned out you got to be separated and then you can see that promise you want a body change you got to be cleaned out you got to be separated you got to be separated from your own ideas from your own will you got to be cleaned out if you want to see God manifested in fullness God's light always brings Clarity and it removes confusion and it REM removes Darkness now all these stories in the old Testament God through his light he separated the darkness and and separated light he separated he even separated the water from the land in the beginning and how did he do it in every case he did it by his word God spoke and the water was separated from the land so brother R said he had a reason for that now now look listen to that real quick how he how he did that in the in in Genesis chapter 1 God said he spoke it let there be a firmament in the midst of the Waters and let it divide the waters from the waters now if you want to paint a picture if you could see like a cross-section of of the sky and the and the ocean there's the whales swimming underneath and there's the water and he divided that water from the water that's in the atmosphere this got clouds and the air that we breathe now come on now we're not talking about some Dome over the Earth or some nonsense like that we're talking about what the Bible speaks of that the firmament the firmament is the the Bible calls it the the heavens the heaven is the firmament you look up in the sky and in the daytime the ocean water is reflected off of the the sky and it bounces back and you can see it looks blue but at night time you can see the like the Bible refers to the all the stars that are painted in the firmament and God is telling us here in the Bible the uh Moses actually is telling us here in the Bible that he divided by his word he divided the water that is in the atmosphere and the water that is under the ocean with all the the Seas and and he divided it by his word and in Genesis 1:9 he said and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together under one place and let the dry land appear so so again he divided by his word he divided all the water that was just floating around he divided it from the land and caused the land to appear it was his word that separated it's his word that separated during the on the seven days of creation it is his word that separates today you see even but even just now as I'm speaking these words it's his word that separates that'll make you think is he telling the truth is that really true or what's true my own ideas my own conception about what the Bible says or is it true what the Bible says about it what's true and the word actually going forth will separate the truth from the false it will SE separate Faith from unbelief how do we know that because the Bible says in Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword the word is like a sword what does it do it separates it says P piercing even to the dividing aund of Soul and Spirit that the word of God can actually separate and divide so you know what we're talking about when we're preaching about flesh and spirit and soul you know where where the word is hidden and of the joints and Mary and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen oh that's really what the preaching of the Gospel is to do it's to not stroke our fur like a kitty that you don't want to upset but it's actually to prick us and make us examine ourselves and and see where we are and what our state is because what it's to it's it's actually like Jesus said in Matthew 10 the word was not given to bring peace but it was actually given to separate to bring division oh you you know you go to a home where where the the father and mother maybe believe in just a nice tape Ministry or something and the other people believe in in things a little bit different way and you can't help but have a Division One Believes going to church the other doesn't believe going to church and you can't help if you stand on what you believe you can't help but be divided there's going to be a divide a division oh but I don't want to be divided from God I want to believe what we might be divided from one another but if we'll keep looking to Christ so that we're United with him he's the one I want to be United with and I want to be separated from all of my unbelief and separated from all of my ideas and separated from all of my will and fully United with him and you'll never be United with God until you're totally separated from all of your unbelief that's what Jesus said think not that I am come to send peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against your mother-in-law and a man's foes shall they be of his own household now you know that doesn't mean that we disrespect our mother and father that doesn't mean that we don't honor somebody that's older than us but what it does mean is that you're going to have to stand on what you believe sooner or later and you can't you can't say well I believe this but I'm going to be opposite of that you you you've got to the word of God is what separates us from other separates us from a different walk how could Abraham and lot walk together if lot was leaning toward Sodom and Abraham was leaning toward a personal encounter with mized it's going to separate you sooner or later it's the word was sent to separate that's why John 177 177 says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth and sanctification means separation how how were they Sanctified how were they cleansed by the word of God that actually was was preached for three and a half years until it began to uh bring about a change in their life to where they they begin to leave the old way Peter P you know Peter and them they were probably fishing and and and spouting off some things that they should not to be saying and and you know Peter was renowned for uh uh fishing naked and all that kind of stuff but I tell you what you get Sanctified and you'll start leaving all that old rough way behind it'll begin to change you it'll begin to separate you from your past so that you are changed that's what sanctification means to se set apart or separate for a holy purpose now aren't you glad sitting here tonight that God wants you to be used for a holy purpose aren't you glad that that's what the gospel was for to make you holy to make you clean we we were talking the other night just sitting around about how people in the world they they think a lot of times that their friends are there to help them but really if you really examine it your friends in the world just want to drag you down and keep you keep you in the in like the Crab Pot like crabs being bold alive and it's crabs reaching up to pull you try to get out of the pot and you're friends are reaching down to grab boy I'm I'm enjoying this wine this afternoon wouldn't you like some I'm I'm sure enjoying this I'm enjoying this television show well don't you want to tune in and watch this television show that you know no Christian has any business watching it and your and your friends that you think are so good will drag you down but I tell you what the word of God will separate you and clean you up and and separate you from those old ungodly friends and those old ungodly ways that you ain't got no business hanging around God's word God is light and his word is light and his light is life and that it will separate you from all the darkness all the nonsense of the world nothing likes Darkness but a bunch of cockroaches scrambling around behind the fridge and and all the dark places but you turn on the light you turn on the light and all that will scatter and I I had to put in my disclaimer not not my house I did I did get in trouble recently I preached that at a church and and I didn't put the disclaimer in that didn't sound right so I got to put that disclaimer in not my house but you know you know we've all you go to school you go to a place that a public place or something that's got got bugs and things but you turn on the light and all that will scatter now look it's the same way in the in the gospel if you want to get real of a problem in your life if you want to overcome something bring it to the light oh the gospel is not about doing some shady business in the darkness over in some back alley some some sidebar discussion but you want to get you want to really overcome and get deliverance and do things the right way you bring it into the light and Shine the light on it you want to get rid of something and have a family discussion and get all the family together and say we're going to air this out out in public where everybody knows what's going on and we're going to shine The Gospel Light on this until we've overcome if you want to get rid of that pornography devil then get it out in the light and and confess it and say I'm done with this thing if you want to get rid of them problems in your house get it in the light and you you watch it run away like a cockroach brother R will say now today if God has made a promise and when that promise is Vindicated then that is light that is the light of the day when the word is a Vindicator the word for the hour is a vindictive I thank I thank God tonight that we're we believe in a live word and a live present day light not oh you know we talk about how we're we're preaching we're preaching meat we're preaching the real word but this is not word this is not meat from some bygone day this is not meat like from Martin Luther John Wesley either the Pentecostal day but this is a present tense reality I think that's what differentiates from us from all the all the other churches of the world is this is alive this is not just some theology or something but there's power in this to deliver you and I I think that's that's what brother Bron was talking about when he said an eagle's got to eat fresh meat fresh meat like you go down into the river and an eagle fishes out a trout and it ain't just a trout that it catches it's got some Decay to it but it's it's got some some it's it's still thrashing around a little bit in other words words it still got some blood pulsing in it and that's what we want to Feast on today we want to Feast on the present tense reality of a living God with some meat that's still got some life in it that's what I want to serve every time I preach I want to preach a word that's got some life some power in it that will deliver you not something to just memorize some quotes or just learn some theology but something that will change every fiber of your being something that'll make you walk right and live right and talk right something that will separate you from the things of the world and make you live holy and make you be a real son and daughter of God that's why John 1:4 says in him was life and the life was the light of men the life was the light of men oh every promise in God's word is light amen he separated in Genesis life from death and Genesis CH 3:24 it says so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and there's that sword again a flaming sword a sword to divide to prevent them from going back I'm Sor what's God doing he's separating Holiness from unbelief and he's placing a sword between to separate unbelief that unclean un look look what what they had gotten themselves into almost something like forgive me if this sounds wrong but almost something it sounds like you you'd find it on Jerry Springer or haraldo or one of all that mess that they had turned into what what do you mean you you got a child of a beast and you almost like you who who's your daddy who one of them situations was like well who's your come on now I'm not trying to make light but this is a real thing and God said go cuz God's like I I I can't you can't come and eat from the Tree of Life in that condition oh all that nonsense and you see that's how some the devil the devil will get us in situations like that in life where your life is just all messed up in chaos and God how how is God going to fulfill his promises in in a situation like that he's got to have a holy being that he can work through he's got to have a holy life that he can fulfill his promises in and that's why he put that flaming sword there which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life you can't eat from the Tree of Life if you ain't living a holy life you can't eat from this tree of life if you ain't separated oh church if you want to eat from this tree of life you got to get your life cleaned up and how better way to get your life cleaned up by the word let the word begin to get a subject oh let the word begin to move in your life and it you'll watch all that unbelief and everything begin to drop away because the Tree of Life separates and access to the Tree of Life requires separation oh Eve questioned just one little phase of God's word brother Bram said if we believe the word of God it is the Word of Life to us but if we question the word of God it's death to us do you see what brother Ram's message is molding us into to a place where we don't doubt not one thing we're not like Sarah sitting back in the tent snickering at the promise of the son of man we're not like lot wanting to go down to the Sodom and Eden or we're not like the children of Israel wanting their leaks and onions back where they came from but we're we're we're we're the the unbelief is dropping away from our life to where we can believe truly that all things are possible that's our problem that we just can't grasp that these promises laying here in the word are really for us even now we're battling it out is it really for me is it really here here on this on this Wednesday night meeting in the middle of the week is all these promises really for me can I hear in the middle of the week after I've been working hard all week can I really get a fresh outpouring of the Holy Ghost is the power of God still manifested in my life and you know that brother R said that's what lot typed the type of somebody who says well I don't know if the days of Miracles are passed or not I don't know if the promises of God are really true I don't know if discernment really is true I don't know if the word will do what it says it will but the word of God is still operating it's still separating and it will do what it says it'll do because there's a God backing it up that doesn't forget his promises that's what Isaiah chapter 60 said behold the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising God will continually continually has been separating and that's what he's doing tonight he's still speaking his Word of Life to those who want to believe it and the world is in Gross Darkness he said you can see it in every meeting he separates Faith from unbelief he speaks out he declares himself to those who will believe and have faith in him he's separating separating and every meeting separating separating separating until the final separation when they'll separate the sheep from the goats he's separating separating and you know that Hebrew word Nazir there's a Hebrew word Nazir that means consecrated or separated now if you're a Nazir to be a Nazir you have to take a vow to be separated to be consecrated and the kind of vow you have to take is called a Nazarite vow and that Nazarite vow means I I'm I'm doing away with all of my own will I I'm doing away with I I I'm separating myself to totally totally to God and when you separate yourself by taking a Nazarite vow it symbolized a total dedication to God now brother BR didn't explain these things just so we'd learn about it but he explained it so that it would Inspire something in us so when we go home there's something stirring within us that I want to be like like that I want to be separated to God so much that God can use me that he can come down and speak to me in the cool of the evening like he did Adam and speak to me like he did Abraham and reveal himself to me like he did Moses in the burning bush I want to be identified with those characters I want to be separated like Samson was it emphasized Holiness and separation from worldly pleasures and impurities if you're going to be a nerite you can't be drinking alcohol cuz you're separated oh oh but we've got so carried away and today well I think I can take a little tody every now and then I think I can get all caught up and all the stuff that the world is doing but if you're going to be a Nazarite you can't do it if you're going to be a real if you're going to be the antitype of the what the levitical priests were you can't be go you got to stay away from that stuff and it a Nazarite vow produces something that is visible visible in the life of the believer you know they got Samson had his seven long locks that everywhere he went they could look and see well he has taken a vow of separation and that's true in in the life of our sisters today you you when you go through Walmart everybody will look at you because you are different and that's what God wants us to be he wants us to be different he don't want us to look like the world and look like the trash and the Holiness of the world but he wants to I'm sorry if that offend you but listen it's like a garbage can out there and forgive me if that offends you that I use the word trash but that is it's a garbage can out there and God doesn't call you to live like a garbage can he doesn't call you to look at the smut and trash of the world but he's called you to live a holy clean life and God is going to have a holy clean life I feel like screaming out like brother Ram did when he saw that church walking by at the end and he said get in line you got to get in line if you want to take a Rapture you got to get in line and it's going to be visible a Nazarite vow is going to be visible where somebody can look at you the world can look at you and say that person is separate they've been separated to something maybe they don't understand what it is but they know that you ain't like them you ain't like them something has got a hold of you and the Nazarite vow required personal sacrifice and discipline I wonder tonight how many of us could say that we're really disciplined I I like what Brother Richard Wilson said he said make time for the word it's my life and sometimes we get it we get that frame in our mind well I I I got to make time to read my Bible I got to make time to read re to to to pray but is it really your life then if you got to set aside time and you got to lay aside all that nastiness on TV to make time for God is it really your life it's supposed to be your life if you love it it'll be your life it'll be your everything it'll be your all if you're really in love with Jesus Christ and the numb the CH sixth chapter a Nazarite call was to separate themselves from all the world separated separated nothing nothing of the world separated no strong drink and no contact with the dead you got to stay away from any dead thing anything that will bring will cause you any kind of a hindrance no contact with the dead and no razors which is why our sisters don't cut their hair because it's a separation you're showing you're that's what Paul said you you don't cut your hair because of the angels and the angels are the ministering spirits that bring you the word and so you're not cutting your hair because you believe the word of God that has been preached and it is a visible sign to you that you are subject to the word of God that has been held over your life that's why brother Rand would say today when we see our sisters wearing long hair as the Bible said they should I think it's a Nazarite sign that they want to follow the lord listen what he said no matter what the price no matter what the price well people at school make fun of me yeah but God's Got Your Back people at work make fun of me yeah but God's on your side listen when when the time comes when when people are getting laid off and and and people are losing their jobs and and and people that you graduate with can't find work oh it'll be good to have God on your side and we're not doing thing we're not working to get a reward but I tell you what God looks and sees when you got faith and you're living a separated life because because you're in love with him and you're want to live for him God knows God knows if you're a real believer he knows if you're a real Abraham if you're a real believer like that I'm telling you it's good to be separated I thank God that God has given us the ability to live a separated holy life that's clean that's Sanctified that's set apart from the world and oh when we go to bed at night that our whole home can have an atmosphere of peace and it's not chaos with the television playing all kinds of stuff on it but we're living in a in a God God can change the atmosphere of our being and change the atmosphere of our mind so that we're not living all called up with all these mind battles and things like the world brother said I believe tonight that every man woman every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of God is a Nazarite under the Lord because they have separated themselves from the cares of the world and whatever the world has got to say you are a separated people holy unto the Lord now when brother R was preaching this this this quotee is from another message he said you are not the same as them and later on this message he'll get to the point there's silver dollars and there's pennies you ain't the same you are a separated people oh God don't want you to be the same he don't want you to be the same as everybody out there you are different and you are different because of the the effect that the word has had on your life not by any particular goodness or something righteousness in yourself but the effect that the word has had on your life has changed you and that has made you a separated people holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of God the Holy Spirit brother said in the message the token he said the holy spirit is an eternal token written across your heart soul make up Mind Body everything else that you are a separated person from unbelief you're a separated person from the things of the world you are separated from Death you're separated from everything and you are a product that God has sealed into the kingdom by his holy spirit that's through separation is the only way to bring light now listen education can't do it and we're not talking about education at the school we're talking about education in the church education won't do it am learning and rot memorization and just learning everything oh but you got to have a personal revelation of Jesus Christ Science can't do it history and math can't do it but God has one way of bringing light to you that's when you're ready to separate yourself from all the things of the world and all the cares of the world and cling only to God's promised word now that's that's been the problem all down Through the Ages hadn't it people not don't want to separate right Eve went out and unbelieved and she just never really got into in her head that she had done something wrong she just didn't want to separate from that always carrying along well I I think surely there's something good that come out of this that's our problem isn't it we think our way is the right way to do it and we're just not ready to separate oursel we're not ready to be a real Nazarite you know brother Brown said now this is a maybe a choker Paul was a Nazarite he was separated now now listen that means that Paul was a Nazarite then I can be a Nazarite and you can be a Nazarite a real Nazarite cuz a Nazarite is a nazer that is separated somebody that has left everything behind Paul was separated from his Orthodox Church to the word of the Living God he said it is a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only unto God and Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that separate at from the cares of the world she is separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we live in oh praise God that means when you go into the supermarket aisle and see how the world's dressing or you see how all your friends dressing you don't have to dress like that where everybody can see every curve and every dimple and everything every everything about you and there's no no secret left to be revealed but you don't have to live like that you are separated from that she is separated from the traditions of churches she is separated only to God and God is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride oh and that's our identification brother R would say that is your credentials as a Believer aren't you glad tonight that we've got that as an identification you know you know going through your Christian Journey people want to identify you and label you as this or that right but we don't have to we don't have to go by how they label us they might label us as a Pentecostal or a charismatic and you know people will try to label you by what church you go to oh well oh you come from Lula or whatever they'll put that label on you and that might mean different things to different people might Pentecostal charismatic fundamental whatever they might put you know they tried to put a label on Jesus that he was beelove but that wasn't his identification that wasn't his credentials our credentials come from the word of God and brother BR said the only credential that a Believer has is the word of God living in him declaring Jesus Christ lives in that person it's the only credential you need that's the only credential we need people will put labels on you and tell you this and that and tell you you look weird you look funny because you're living a separated life what kind of a oddl looking thing must a Nazarite been with his his Seven Locks hanging down from the back of his head oh but he didn't take his identification from what people called him but boy the word of God said about him and oh praise God when I look into the word and I can be identified with what the word of God says I am and be glad I I can be glad to live a so holy separated life he said that's a separated Nazarite unto the Lord separated for the word's sake separate yourself from the woman of this world join yourself to the Bel blessings that God has promised to every believer lot was like a perfect type of the lukewarm carnal-minded believer today that still wants to cling with what their tradition says instead of taking what the word says yeah I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to find a place to helicopter in I y'all I I don't like going over 45 minutes on is that I'm trying to he said when the second Adam was created in the womb of a woman and came to the world he was a Nazarite to the word of God so Jesus's whole life was totally separated from the cradle all the way to the culmination of his ministry there was oh you think about what an example Jesus was there was no unbelief found in him nowhere he said who can condemn me of sin sin is unbelief if I haven't done just what was prophesied for this age if I haven't met the requirements of what Messiah is supposed to do then don't believe me search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me tell you who he is so there's our real identification when the scripture says the scripture said who he was and the scripture will say who you are because every scripture that speaks of Jesus also speaks of you because you're part of him and you're wrapped up in him he he said that's why he said that Greater Works than these shall you do because you're going to do the same thing you're going to act the same way because the same life that was in Jesus is in you and that makes you a separated set aart people and any real born again Christian is a Nazarite totally separated oh there's a question for us tonight how separated are we all always brother Bram said the word requires total and complete separation Jesus said let every man's word be a lie let mine be true and that should guide the compass of our life something pops into our mind that's contrary to the word cast it down I I can't I can't agree with that I'm not going forward with that it's not possible it's not true the devil that's that's the devil the devil's tactic is to give us some reasonable out just something reasonable and then we'll accept it something reasonable come come with well I I it it's reasonable to think that the doctor's report is true oh but if God's word says contrary to that take God's word because he he God backs up his promises Isaiah was separated from the church World Moses was separated from the church world and all the prophets and Jesus and the apostles and and and all the way down to Abraham who was a separated person from the world GE God told him separate yourself from your Kindred and from all of the unbelief and come out into a world that you've never walked in before and amongst a people that you've never known before come out and separate yourself from anybody that would be contrary to what you're believing that you would be a Nazarite under the Lord because he was holding a promise of a son and you know today we're holding that same promise not the promise of Isaac but we're holding a promise of a son to see God fully manifested in our lives and he's not going to be fully manifested until we separate from all unbelief Abraham had to separate he had to leave C he had to separate from his father and from his mother and from his Kindred and what separated him tonight because he believed that God was able to keep the promise that he had given he believed and lot did not lot could not believe that the days of P the days of Miracles were not passed he went down into Sodom and gamorra after all that but Abraham held on and God in a human form sat down before him and talked and Sarah was almost a hundred years old laughed because the angel said I will visit you according to the time of promise now now here's and I'm going to be closing in just a second but here's the strange one of the strangest things that brother random would ever say is that all believers are not the same that lot lot was like a penny and Abraham was like a silver dollar lot wanted the world lot he brother would say you pull out a bunch of change there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars dollars all in coins now that's where the world is in God's hand there's some people that just can have a Penny's worth of it and God can only use them in a penny way that's all all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because God uses penni sometimes lot was just a penny Abraham was a silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots to make in Abraham now how do we know which one we are if the if our credentials are the word of God and the word of God is our identification that's how we know what we are if I identify myself with Abraham if I identify myself with lot that tells what we are so when you read the Bible oh that's what the the power of the Gospel is when you get along in the morning time with your coffee and you're reading through the Bible it's actually it it's like taking a DNA test it identifies back to show you who your daddy is it identifies back to show where you come from to identify you it is your identification and it will show you what you are oh this morning I want or tonight I want to encourage you I I I don't want to just have a little Penny amount of Faith but I want to have enough faith in my life I want to have enough enough separation from unbelief to where if I want if I desire something big from God and we're talking about a promised son you're going to have to have silver dollar Faith to see the promised son you can't have a little Penny faith and see the son of man revealed in your life you got to have silver dollar faith brother Brown even said he said in one place we got to have we got we can barely have of faith for a two twoth how are we going to take a Rapture how are you going to take a Rapture with a little Penny Faith oh and see how he's identifying us with our faith God don't care what you look like or how you part your hair or but he cares about your faith do you believe his word and your faith is tied to how he's looking at you are you are you somebody that was going to believe everything he said or you somebody that's going to can't can't can't really can't really believe that he's still a present in tense help that there's still power in this gospel oh lot was just a penny and Abraham was a silver dollar he said he can only take a Penny's worth that's all he's got so you see people that say I don't believe in healing I don't believe in these things just know it's a penny but just let him alone see just a Penny's worth so that's all he can buy don't stop him just let him alone remember that's just all the farther he can go he said he lot couldn't believe in discernment and the powers of God that's promise for this day but I might not be able to understand all that's in there but I believe it it's God's word I want to separate myself from anything that's contrary to it that's right how do we separate ourselves we get into the rhythm of the word get into the word because the rhythm of the word as you're going through the Sheep music it'll tell you what's coming up and and and I'm trying to make it short here but brother R going say the sheet music will tell you whether you're an Abraham or whether you're a lot and what's going to happen next what's coming up down the road it'll tell you all these things if we'll just get in the rhythm of the word to separate ourselves fully from unbelief fully from the word fully so that we can take God at his word if God said it and you know as the musicians come forward the bride will be separated the bride will be totally separated from the world the bride has to be separated to move into the promises if God promised it you can have access to it but you got to separate yourself from your unbelief brother R will say these words are you willing to separate yourself tonight from all unbelief to hear the word of the Lord if you'll do it and believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever these things what he has promised to do we see him doing it we see him we've seen so many things that God has done uh this weekend I was talking to Zach and Lily and Lily was telling us about her her brother brother-in-law how he got electrocuted and his shoulder was shattered his the socket was shattered in his shoulder and they were going to have to do all this surgery on him but you know what the the church got together and they prayed and they got some saints together that believed that the power of God was still real and they did another X-Ray when he went back to the doctor and there wasn't nothing wrong and the doctor was mixed mystified they gathered around because that shoulder that they had seen was shattered and he couldn't use it was completely healed and oh that's why tonight we're not talking about just some meat from some bygone age but we're talking about some meat with some blood in it some meat that's still pulsing some they still got some thrashing around in it like a little trout that an eagle just pulls out of the stream there's some life in it it's not something dead it's not something dead from byone asan tonight I invite you as we stand to our feet if you need something tonight I believe that we can have confidence in a present tense Living God if we'll just SE separate oursel lay down our unbelief lay down all those carnal ideas that the devil's trying to throw at us to say well you can't have it it's it's too late it's it's beyond the reach of anything that God can do well that's what the doctor said when when they looked at his shattered shoulder but that ain't what God Said and that ain't what those Believers said when they laid hands on him that oh we're serving a god is still God he's still the same yesterday today and forever and tonight maybe remember all those times maybe years ago that God come on the scene for you and remember that and let that lift up your faith to to so that you realize that that same God that was with you then he's still with you today if you can just believe him you love the Lord let's worship him if you have a need come forward and we'll be glad to pray with you thou strong [Music] oh Jesus keep me he'll keep you when you can't keep yourself he's the one that's doing it will be satisfied [Music] as as I walk let me walk close to thee [Music] just a

you'll get that closer walk by walking through the word so I brother Ryan brought up these uh I I I suppose it's a little gift from sister Alicia to um and brother John to um to brother Dale and sister Dale and you're asking if the ministers could come and just pray over these amen so brother Aaron and brother Louise brother Wade if y'all come and would us pray over these at this time and yes
