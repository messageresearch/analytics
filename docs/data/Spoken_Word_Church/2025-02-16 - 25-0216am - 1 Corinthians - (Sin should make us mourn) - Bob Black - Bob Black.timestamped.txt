[0:00] the devil he gets upset sometimes um we
[0:04] had a good time yesterday didn't
[0:06] we and uh good to see a full house this
[0:09] morning and all of our friends and
[0:12] family that we haven't seen in a while
[0:14] and uh so we're just going to continue
[0:16] from uh in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and
[0:18] just take a little topic that sin should
[0:20] make us mourn it should uh you know when
[0:24] we start just kind of getting complacent
[0:25] and see things uh uh you know know this
[0:30] is before we pray this is kind of a
[0:33] difficult thing to talk about what to to
[0:35] read through what Paul's saying here in
[0:37] 1 Corinthians chapter 5
[0:39] because it it makes people nervous when
[0:42] you start going through these things but
[0:44] what we're just going to do is we're
[0:45] going to it's like stacking sticks for a
[0:47] campfire we're just we're just laying
[0:49] sticks out this morning and uh and let
[0:52] the chips fall where they may and study
[0:55] this out and uh we we'll just uh tackle
[0:58] it from that perspective let's go to the
[1:00] Lord in prayer Lord God we're so
[1:02] grateful Lord that we can come to you
[1:04] not through the blood of the of bus and
[1:07] goats this morning but through the blood
[1:08] of the Lamb of God and we come Lord
[1:10] Jesus Lord expecting Lord that you will
[1:13] teach us and instruct us and guide us
[1:15] through these scriptures that we're
[1:16] reading this morning by the holy ghost
[1:18] that you've given unto us Lord Jesus
[1:20] that we can Lord look through the eyes
[1:22] of that Holy Ghost teacher Lord God and
[1:24] give us the true meaning and the true
[1:26] essence of what we're studying out Lord
[1:27] Jesus and make these things real to us
[1:29] Lord we ask Lord your blessing upon the
[1:31] service today Lord God that you'll be
[1:33] with brother Burley as he's preparing
[1:34] Lord Jesus be with us all of us Lord
[1:36] that our hearts will be receptive Lord
[1:38] Jesus to receive what you have for us
[1:40] today Lord and give us exactly what we
[1:42] have need of Lord we pray God that
[1:44] you'll just bless us now in your name
[1:47] amen so uh and and uh we'll just kind of
[1:50] backtrack a little bit and and I don't
[1:52] have any slides I'm just going to just
[1:54] kind of talk through some of these
[1:55] scriptures but he said uh in verse one
[1:59] of chapter 5 it's reported commonly that
[2:02] there is fornication among you and uh
[2:05] and and I I I love that to kind of tie
[2:08] the uh if you tie the run this through
[2:10] from 1 Corinthians over to Second
[2:12] Corinthians in 1 Corinthians he's really
[2:15] uh getting the whip out in second
[2:17] Corinthians and if you want to read
[2:20] where uh he's Recon this person is
[2:22] reconciled and the church is reconciling
[2:24] everything boy Paul's pouring on the
[2:27] praise he's like now you youve hel
[2:30] handled everything with Zeal you were so
[2:32] zealous zealous to to get everything
[2:34] straightened up and and and so and and
[2:37] that's how the right reaction when
[2:40] there's something wrong in our lives or
[2:42] something wrong in in a church body or
[2:44] anything like that if we if we look at
[2:46] it like the way that the Corinthians
[2:48] were looking at it first with just
[2:50] apathy and complacency oh well then
[2:54] that's the problem that Paul's trying to
[2:56] address but if we'll look at it like
[2:58] they did in 2 Corinthians with Zeal
[3:00] ready to get things straightened up
[3:02] ready to come with desperation then
[3:05] that's when God can come in our midst
[3:06] and really move so he said it's reported
[3:09] commonly that there is fornication among
[3:11] you and such fornication as is not so
[3:13] much as named among the Gentiles that
[3:15] one should have his father's
[3:17] wife and of course their reaction wasn't
[3:19] that great he said you are puffed
[3:21] up and have not rather mourn that he
[3:24] hath done this thing might be taken away
[3:26] from you so there's where I'm getting
[3:29] the topic from that sin should make us
[3:31] mourn it should not our reaction should
[3:34] not be to get all puffed up and and and
[3:36] and and respond in that negative way but
[3:38] to to to be afflicted because that
[3:42] something's wrong in our
[3:44] midst and you know uh our body is is a
[3:48] temple and and we're all part of a
[3:51] collective body of Believers if you know
[3:54] if there's anything wrong in your body
[3:55] in the natural like cancer or something
[3:57] that Springs up it begins to affect the
[3:59] whole body
[4:00] if sickness affects your and one little
[4:03] cell one little wrong cell can start to
[4:05] affect your whole body and bring you
[4:06] down in weakness and and bring you to a
[4:09] place where you can't even get out of
[4:10] the bed well take apply that to this to
[4:13] to the church what Paul's saying here is
[4:15] that it's not good for for you to just
[4:18] Overlook things in the body of Believers
[4:20] because one one little thing wrong in
[4:23] the body of
[4:24] Believers can cause well you know you've
[4:27] got unbelievers coming in and they look
[4:30] and they see somebody that's proc
[4:31] proclaiming to proclaiming to be a
[4:33] Christian but they're not live they're
[4:36] living in a blatant violation of what we
[4:39] know to be the gospel teaching and
[4:42] they'll start to say well where's your
[4:44] testimony what what are what's what's
[4:47] going on with your life and it begins to
[4:50] it it can damage the whole church
[4:52] because of just leaving something
[4:55] undone so Sin Sin left unchecked can can
[4:58] anybody just like in your
[5:00] natural body just a little a little
[5:02] illness you know the the flu is going
[5:04] around you know you get a little just
[5:06] one little think I've seen those little
[5:08] things where they they'll they'll show
[5:10] how much flu can can just you
[5:12] and bring you down right well the same
[5:15] thing in the body of Christ is is the
[5:17] point that we're trying to make now you
[5:18] keep reading down through through uh 1
[5:20] Corinthians 5 and Paul starts making the
[5:23] point he Compares it to the Feast of
[5:25] unleavened bread which we'll get to in a
[5:28] second that he's saying Purge out
[5:29] therefore the old leaven in other words
[5:32] it's time to get cleaned up and now if
[5:34] you go study out in in the Old Testament
[5:36] where they they had the Feast of
[5:38] Passover where they went behind the the
[5:40] shed blood and they ate the the lamb and
[5:42] then the very next day they entered into
[5:44] the Feast of unleavened bread which is
[5:46] is time to get out and that that seven
[5:49] days where they were journeying from
[5:51] from under that under that blood and and
[5:55] God made a way for them to get out of
[5:57] Egypt 7even days of of of of traversing
[6:00] Into the Wilderness they did it so fast
[6:02] that they didn't have time for the for
[6:04] the bread to rise and all those kind of
[6:06] things so it's it's typing getting rid
[6:09] of the old life leaving leaving that old
[6:11] life and so what's what's Paul really
[6:14] expressing here in 1 Corinthians chapter
[6:15] 5 is that when you're born again things
[6:18] are going to begin to change in your
[6:20] life and you're going to get rid of that
[6:22] that old leaven is going to be left away
[6:25] that the the old Covenant the old life
[6:28] all of that is going to be
[6:30] done away with and and Christ makes us
[6:32] as he says a new lump a new lump now
[6:35] without without leav so in other words
[6:37] in other words the Holy Ghost cleans you
[6:39] up now there's so many messages where
[6:42] brother R talked about this concept like
[6:44] the Paradox we we know the Paradox you
[6:46] are the Paradox because a paradox is
[6:48] when when something miraculous happens
[6:50] and it's miraculous that God can take
[6:52] somebody that's got an old nasty
[6:54] horrible life and can change them can
[6:57] change them and make them different so
[6:59] that's what he saying the Corinthians
[7:01] got it in they're maybe got this state
[7:02] of apathy where they're they're not
[7:04] expecting change anymore they've got all
[7:07] the doctrine they've got maybe they
[7:09] they've heard the teachings of Paul or
[7:11] whatnot and they just get apathetic and
[7:13] and forget that that the sticks have got
[7:16] to be lit that the campfire has got to
[7:18] be on fire it's not good enough just to
[7:20] have the sticks piled up and they got
[7:23] all puffed up in a cloud of confusion
[7:27] and
[7:28] Chaos now that's that's what you know
[7:30] Satan deliberately he creates Confusion
[7:32] by perverting what God has made into
[7:34] something
[7:35] untrue he mixes up what is
[7:38] right with what is wrong and that's what
[7:42] causes doubt and leads individuals away
[7:44] from the clear unadulterated word of God
[7:47] and now so the Corinthians got a little
[7:49] bit mixed up in other words they they
[7:51] had become mixed up in what their focus
[7:53] should be they were indifferent to sin
[7:56] they were failing to mourn because of
[7:58] Pride all buffed up and
[8:00] self-satisfaction now now is that isn't
[8:03] that just a terrible place to be I I I
[8:06] love to study out like the character of
[8:07] people throughout the scripture look at
[8:09] the character they they they got
[8:10] self-satisfied with their state of Li
[8:14] probably you know had a lot of material
[8:16] wealth and things and and that was good
[8:18] enough for him but Paul's really
[8:21] bringing the whip to them that it
[8:23] matters when we sin right it it matters
[8:27] when when things off-kilter in a body of
[8:31] Believers it matters when something's
[8:33] wrong in your own spiritual life because
[8:37] it it and it and it also it matters what
[8:40] we endorse it matters what you put your
[8:42] hand to and say well I'm going to
[8:44] endorse something that's wrong or
[8:46] something that's not right you say like
[8:48] like the Corinthians say Well it it
[8:50] ain't that bad we'll just Overlook it
[8:53] ain't that bad but it was bad enough
[8:55] it's like if a little cancer shell in
[8:57] the body is bad enough to take care of
[8:58] that thing get get go to the doctor and
[9:01] get it get it taken care of go through
[9:02] the prayer line whatever you need to do
[9:05] cuz just as your temple must be kept
[9:07] clean the church has got to be kept
[9:10] clean in other words get the leaven out
[9:13] get get all the leaven out and you know
[9:15] if if you really study out what Levan is
[9:17] leevan is just it's just a little unseen
[9:20] little particle leen's in air you put
[9:22] out some Sour of bread and and and Le
[9:26] yeast can can just fall into it just
[9:27] from the air it's every just a little
[9:29] bit of that can cause the whole the
[9:32] whole dough to rise just a little bit
[9:34] will actually permeate through every
[9:36] little particle of of the dough and
[9:38] before long it's it's it's it's caused a
[9:41] reaction in the whole
[9:43] thing the same thing with sin you let a
[9:46] little little little small little thing
[9:48] begin to take place and it'll grow and
[9:49] grow and grow I mean you could see that
[9:51] same pattern through the seals just
[9:53] something that starts small actually
[9:55] will grow and grow grow until whoa it's
[9:58] just it's taking over
[10:00] right so allow an unrepented sin to
[10:03] persist creates us what does it do it
[10:05] creates a stumbling block to the
[10:07] individual it makes it more difficult it
[10:11] makes it it's it creates a stumbling
[10:12] block to the individual as well as to
[10:15] others it makes it more difficult for
[10:18] the church to represent the
[10:20] gospel now now that isn't that how the
[10:23] gospel Works people people out out there
[10:25] in the world will see your life and then
[10:27] they want to know more about it
[10:29] and then then they find out to get to
[10:31] the life to get to the blood you got to
[10:33] go through the word and then they start
[10:35] asking questions about the word what do
[10:37] you believe but what's first is the life
[10:41] that life that blood the life is in the
[10:43] blood so then you got you got things
[10:46] that that you're not living right it
[10:48] makes it more difficult for the church
[10:49] to represent the gospel and then it
[10:52] damages the church's witness cuz the
[10:54] life don't look right and then it
[10:57] affects your unity and it might
[10:59] encourage the same behavior in others
[11:01] now now that's the real the real
[11:03] terrible thing is when when you got
[11:05] young people and unbelievers and what
[11:07] not sitting in the church and they look
[11:08] and see what well they're they're doing
[11:10] it then I I can do it too and then it
[11:13] just skews the whole message of the
[11:15] gospel because the life is not right
[11:18] that's right and so what Paul's trying
[11:20] to express here as he frames everything
[11:22] up in First Corinthians five is every
[11:24] believer is accountable before God every
[11:28] you know you think about that that if
[11:29] something wrong is wrong in the church
[11:31] like that and brother I've got quotes
[11:33] where brother R would say if you see
[11:34] something in the church it's you it's
[11:36] your
[11:37] responsibility to to go to that person
[11:39] and say brother you ain't living right
[11:42] right you ain't you ain't doing right
[11:43] you're not you're not living what the
[11:45] gospel
[11:46] teaches CU inconsistency between CL
[11:49] claiming to be born being born again and
[11:51] continued sin sinful Behavior can lead
[11:54] to Serious
[11:56] consequences so the Corinthians were
[11:58] they were they were satisfied without
[12:01] change you know you know sometimes maybe
[12:04] maybe we in this present day can kind of
[12:06] get in that mode just maybe like the
[12:08] Corinthians were that it's it's fine
[12:10] just to kind of come to church and and
[12:12] just kind of be a be a part of the of
[12:14] the thing I I think you know it's so
[12:16] hard for us to get away from that
[12:18] Baptist idea sometimes that have have
[12:20] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[12:22] believed that just because you're part
[12:24] of the group that that does not mean
[12:27] that that's that's the end of the story
[12:29] it's not good enough just to like we use
[12:32] that campfire analogy again it's not
[12:33] good enough just to stack up the sticks
[12:36] and say well I've got all the sticks of
[12:38] the doctrine but it's got to actually be
[12:40] lit it's got to be on fire and we stack
[12:43] up all the mechanics we pile up all the
[12:45] mechanics we got our nice stack of
[12:47] mechanics but the Dynamics have got to
[12:49] be present it's got to be on fire and
[12:51] what is the Dynamics it's the Life of
[12:54] Christ actually lived in you not not
[12:57] coming to church and saying I'm a
[12:58] Christian but then there's fornication
[13:00] coming to church and and Paul would lay
[13:02] out all his list coming to church join
[13:05] the join the church but then you revile
[13:07] your wife you you Grail against your
[13:09] wife and Paul that was part of part of
[13:12] Paul's list of things that you're not
[13:13] going to inherit the kingdom of God if
[13:15] you're a reviler if you're drunken if
[13:17] you're if you're Covetous if you just
[13:19] want to he all these things to yourself
[13:21] and you just can't you want to have what
[13:23] the neighbor has and all these things
[13:25] because what what what's he getting to
[13:27] the The Life of Christ has got got to be
[13:29] manifest in the church the fruits have
[13:32] got to be present so what compromise
[13:35] compromise like the Corinthians we're
[13:37] willing to do compromise leads the
[13:38] church to start resembling an
[13:41] organization it it loses its
[13:44] distinctiveness but you think about that
[13:47] that we've got to be distinct that's
[13:49] that when you had started adhering to
[13:50] the word it makes you dress different it
[13:53] makes you walk different it makes you
[13:54] look different you don't you don't drink
[13:56] anymore you don't gamble anymore there's
[13:59] change and brother BR would say in the
[14:01] testimony of a true witness he said
[14:03] God's word is a true W witness right and
[14:06] God's word said in the last days there
[14:08] would come perilous
[14:10] times and men's Hearts would fail them
[14:12] for fear and perplexed of times and
[14:14] distress between the Nations and there'd
[14:16] come a falling away from the church and
[14:19] men would rise up and showing themselves
[14:22] big dignitaries and so forth and would
[14:25] power away from the church and have a
[14:27] form of godliness and deny the real
[14:30] power of
[14:31] God Church joining he spoke of the
[14:35] church getting in that condition and he
[14:38] he talked about how that the church
[14:40] would just become a lodge rather than a
[14:42] vibrant holy Community thus jeopardizing
[14:44] its mission to preach the gospel instead
[14:47] of striving for Holiness the church
[14:49] starts to adopt worldly isms and
[14:52] compromises that turn the church into a
[14:55] place defined by tradition and human
[14:57] standards rather than by God God's word
[15:00] you know you list out all those isms
[15:02] Calvinism Armenian ISM trinitarianism
[15:04] denominationalism ecumenicalism romanism
[15:07] nickan ISM bism and all those things are
[15:10] are just summing up just a cold formal
[15:14] religion where it's not something that
[15:16] you can get warned by it's not something
[15:18] that's alive now that's the problem with
[15:21] the Corinthians is
[15:23] that this person wasn't alive and Paul's
[15:27] Paul's framing it up that this that kind
[15:29] of thing in your life should should make
[15:31] you
[15:32] mourn if go if sin is left unchecked
[15:35] God's judgment is inevitable the Bible
[15:37] says that if you if you if you get if
[15:40] you start forgetting about the first
[15:42] works then he'll actually take your
[15:44] Candlestick out of his place except you
[15:46] repent he'll actually remove the
[15:49] Candlestick so the Church of the Living
[15:51] God is not to tolerate fornication in
[15:53] any of his forms not spiritual not
[15:56] natural hey you know what fornication
[15:58] really is
[16:00] is is when you turn away you're turning
[16:04] away a turning of your soul and spirit
[16:06] away from his word and his promises in
[16:09] favor of something counterfeit or some
[16:11] other worldly influence instead of
[16:13] looking to God's promise you start
[16:15] looking to something else and you start
[16:18] giving your heart to something else same
[16:20] thing in the natural instead of giving
[16:22] your heart to your wife you start giving
[16:24] your heart to something else and brother
[16:27] R said and God keeps his word he's he
[16:28] said they commit spiritual fornication
[16:31] they let their congregations
[16:33] paint their women wear shorts they let
[16:37] them go out and dress like the world and
[16:39] never condemn it they let the men smoke
[16:41] a social cigarette and take a drink of
[16:44] liquor they let them have their little
[16:46] card parties and play pool in the
[16:47] basement and have the proms and dances
[16:50] in the church and soup suppers and every
[16:51] other thing and teach their little petty
[16:54] theology instead of word of the Living
[16:56] God you know that's the truth it's Petty
[16:59] juvenile cissified I don't know what of
[17:01] the devil in in Christ's name I condemn
[17:04] it in the light of God's word and say we
[17:07] must be a
[17:08] regenerated Holy Ghost inspired Born
[17:11] Again walk in Walking In humility and
[17:13] the presence of God to ever make the
[17:16] Rapture in the days to
[17:20] come now this is Paul Paul's laying out
[17:24] that if you see something like this in
[17:25] the church and we're just study we're
[17:27] just walking through these scriptures
[17:29] then it must cause you to mourn so much
[17:31] until you're willing to start kind of
[17:34] removing that person from your
[17:36] fellowship you in other words you don't
[17:38] endorse you don't endorse somebody
[17:40] that's
[17:41] blatantly smoking that weed somebody
[17:45] that's blatantly living in fornication
[17:48] somebody that's blatantly uh you know
[17:50] living say Crossing that line and say
[17:52] what I'm I'm I'm a born again Christian
[17:54] I'm a Christian but their life is not
[17:57] manifesting it blatantly like
[18:03] that and you know I I I I've just been
[18:06] kind of thinking about how our our mind
[18:08] looks at things you know as we hear the
[18:11] word it our the word is actually shaping
[18:14] up it's changing our life and it's
[18:16] changing the way that we look at things
[18:18] and and that's that was the Corinthians
[18:20] problem they were they were unwilling to
[18:23] judge correctly that there was a problem
[18:26] in their midst and now you can you can
[18:28] even see that kind of thing and in just
[18:30] the natural just look around I I I I I I
[18:34] us I was I'm just going to throw this
[18:36] out there I was I was watching a
[18:38] situation unfold years ago where where
[18:41] there was a situation of fornication and
[18:43] I I watched how people would react that
[18:45] they would almost endorse that situation
[18:49] well that don't they deserve to be happy
[18:52] and it's like these Christians will look
[18:54] at a situation like that and say well
[18:56] that person deserves to be happy it's
[18:59] because their mind is not framing things
[19:01] up correctly and not able to judge you
[19:04] know I don't care how much desire you
[19:06] have to be happy if you look at someone
[19:08] that's blatantly living in sin then then
[19:11] it it's not according to the word it's
[19:14] wrong now that's what Paul was saying in
[19:16] verse three he said I'm not even there
[19:18] with you I'm absent in body but present
[19:21] in spirit I've already judged already
[19:24] and in other words I I know y'all are
[19:26] not doing right as though I were present
[19:29] concerning him that hath so done this
[19:30] deed in the name of our Lord Jesus
[19:33] Christ when ye are gathered together in
[19:35] my spirit with the power of our Lord
[19:37] Jesus Christ to deliver such and one
[19:39] unto Satan for the destruction of the
[19:41] flesh that the spirit may be saved in
[19:44] the day of the Lord Jesus so Paul what
[19:47] he saying he's recognized that this
[19:49] believer's Behavior was so out of line
[19:52] with the
[19:53] gospel something got to happen right so
[19:56] out of line with the gospel
[19:59] so he is saying the person's got to be
[20:01] expelled from the church fellowship and
[20:03] that that safe environment of Believers
[20:05] where everybody's endorsing that kind of
[20:07] behavior and left to face the
[20:09] consequences of his
[20:11] sin you know the consequences of your
[20:14] sin if you were to stay in that kind of
[20:15] a situation where you're living in a
[20:18] place of fornication or something you
[20:19] know the Bible says that adulterers go
[20:21] to hell I said one of Paul's list in 1
[20:24] Corinthians chapter 6 the very next
[20:25] chapter he said know ye not that the
[20:28] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[20:29] kingdom of God right be not deceived
[20:32] neither
[20:33] fornicators nor
[20:35] idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate
[20:39] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[20:42] nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards
[20:46] nor revilers nor
[20:48] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[20:51] of God so there's consequences of living
[20:54] in a state where you you think you're
[20:56] right but you're you're Li life has not
[20:59] been changed and it's not bearing the
[21:01] characteristics of
[21:05] Christ this this kind of this kind of
[21:07] talk is is kind of hard is it right you
[21:11] you can feel the atmosphere everybody's
[21:12] kind of drawing up and whatnot because
[21:14] it's it gets down you know you can lay
[21:16] out that we've got to have uh the
[21:18] stature of a perfect man and you got to
[21:20] grow come to maturity but when you get
[21:22] down into the weeds of what your
[21:23] character is that your character has got
[21:25] to got to actually represent the Life of
[21:27] Christ and you know brother Brandon
[21:29] would actually say in one place he said
[21:31] if you want to know whether whether
[21:32] you're born again or not if you're if
[21:34] you're a child of the first Adam you're
[21:36] going to act like the first Adam but if
[21:39] you're a child of the second Adam you're
[21:41] going to act like they did on the day of
[21:43] Pentecost another words when the fire
[21:45] got lit on the day of Pentecost it
[21:47] caused a change in their life and where
[21:49] those old things that old Covenant the
[21:51] old leav drops away and God transforms
[21:55] your life and you begin to act
[21:57] different and Paul PA was say he said I
[21:59] I wrote unto you in an epistle and in
[22:02] verse n he said I wrote unto you in an
[22:03] epistle not to company with fornicators
[22:06] in other words he's saying don't
[22:08] tolerate don't tolerate unrepentant sin
[22:11] among those who claim to belong to God
[22:15] now that was the problem with the
[22:16] Corinthians that's a problem that's a
[22:18] problem still today in Le out of seir
[22:21] that we just we just put up we put up
[22:22] with the Devil the devil come at our
[22:24] home and and and and we'll just well
[22:26] we'll just put up with it we'll we
[22:29] we you know we'll make list like Paul we
[22:31] can make a list like Paul of all the
[22:33] things that we put up with but it still
[22:34] stands true that we we uh he he's trying
[22:37] to say don't tolerate it brother R would
[22:40] say God telling the Holy Holy Church
[22:42] which is his body here on Earth that now
[22:45] this is after the Old Testament and the
[22:47] new telling a man that was so filthy and
[22:49] dirty amongst the people that he lived
[22:51] with his own father's wife said such a
[22:54] thing in the body of Christ you Church
[22:56] turn him over to the devil for the
[22:58] destruction
[22:59] see God permits the and when he has got
[23:01] somebody has to see done to put a whip
[23:03] on somebody he'll turn an evil spirit
[23:06] loose on them so that they'll torment
[23:07] that person and bring them
[23:10] back in Hebrews chapter 7 he said don't
[23:13] never let nothing hinder this
[23:15] church if it does you're guilty each one
[23:18] of
[23:19] you each one of us are
[23:22] guilty and you and your different
[23:25] churches if something is going wrong in
[23:27] your church you're guilty because you're
[23:29] the overseer of that church it ain't up
[23:32] to the pastor it ain't up to the Deacon
[23:34] board it's up to you you individual
[23:37] could go to that brother and see if you
[23:40] can have him
[23:41] reconcile if not then take two or three
[23:43] with you then come back he won't hear
[23:46] that tell it to the church then he's
[23:47] dismissed from the kingdom of God God
[23:49] said if you dismiss him there I'll
[23:51] dismiss him here if you went through
[23:53] this order then he'll turn the devil
[23:55] loose to him for the destruction of his
[23:57] flesh and then he'll come back that's
[23:59] right that's the way to make him come
[24:00] back if he's a child of God he'll come
[24:03] back if he isn't why he'll go on and
[24:05] then the devil will send him on to his
[24:07] eternal place now that you you think
[24:10] that that's what the Church of the
[24:11] Living God is supposed to be that when
[24:13] you come to church you come with an awe
[24:15] and a reverence to know that there's a
[24:17] standard that you got to live by come
[24:19] with that fear of God that that there's
[24:21] a body of Believers that are Towing the
[24:23] line and we've got to tow the line too
[24:26] you know there's that story brother I'm
[24:27] told of of the little Wesley rasmusen
[24:29] who was a pastor son and I I'll tell the
[24:31] story and then we'll
[24:32] stop that where he said uh Wesley Matt
[24:35] rasmusen was was was uh it's in the
[24:38] message why are we not a
[24:39] denomination he wasn't living right he
[24:41] was he was living out in the world and
[24:44] and the Pastor said it was his the
[24:46] pastor's son he said I'm I'm I'm giving
[24:48] him till such and such a time to to make
[24:51] it right and and and get right with God
[24:54] and he was up behind the platform and
[24:56] looking at the clock and the clock you
[24:58] know struck the time and he said all he
[25:00] said brother randam said I just I'm
[25:02] we're now going to turn him over to the
[25:04] devil for the destruction of the Flesh
[25:06] in other words we ain't endorsing that
[25:10] anymore and and uh and brother R said
[25:13] that's all was said nothing went on for
[25:15] a week or two maybe a month or two and
[25:18] one night old Wesley took
[25:21] sick and now this this is not just a
[25:24] lesson for the church it's a lesson for
[25:25] your families as well right you pray
[25:28] like this for your children say Lord if
[25:30] you need to squeeze them through the
[25:32] wine press my children squeeze them a
[25:34] little bit put them through the ringer
[25:37] right God will get to move God will God
[25:40] God can use the devil as a
[25:42] tool he'll reach over in his toolbox and
[25:45] let a devil go to work and one night old
[25:48] Wesley took sick and when he got sick he
[25:51] kept getting
[25:52] sicker he called the doctor I I I'm
[25:55] going to step back and just say this I
[25:58] lot of people think that my family looks
[26:00] perfect on the outside but if you know
[26:02] me really good some of yall know me
[26:04] enough to know the challenges that I've
[26:06] faced with some of my children as
[26:08] they've grown up and and you know the
[26:10] challenges and and there's things like
[26:13] this that maybe you don't know all the
[26:15] details but but
[26:18] you and I I can't share all the details
[26:21] cuz it ain't my testimony to share but
[26:24] but you watch you you turn things over
[26:26] to God and God can God can do this is
[26:31] real God can begin to do
[26:35] something where where after it's all
[26:38] said and done then maybe you look at it
[26:40] and say well bless God brother Bob's
[26:42] family's perfect or whatever but you
[26:45] don't see all the behind the scenes you
[26:47] don't see all the travail and the
[26:49] turmoil and the late nights of prayer
[26:51] and the and and watching the devil
[26:54] actually do something that God is
[26:56] allowing to mold to move and you don't
[26:59] see all of
[27:00] that and and so one night old Wesley
[27:03] took sick and when he got sick he kept
[27:05] getting sicker he called the doctor the
[27:07] doctor come up and examined it he had a
[27:10] fever of 105 couldn't find no reason for
[27:13] it he just kept getting sicker doctor
[27:15] said boy I don't know what's happened to
[27:17] you he didn't know what to do he said
[27:19] we'll we'll call a specialist they
[27:21] called a specialist and a specialist
[27:23] come in there they took him over to the
[27:25] hospital examined him everything else he
[27:27] said I just can't tell you the boy just
[27:29] looks deathly his wife standing there
[27:31] crying and everything like that and the
[27:33] children standing around the bed and
[27:35] everyone like that he said he's going
[27:37] that's all his pulse and respiration is
[27:39] just going down all the
[27:41] time and he said call Daddy the
[27:44] musicians can go ahead and come oh yeah
[27:47] that's the way to do it call
[27:50] daddy and his daddy run out there to the
[27:53] hospital real quick to see him he said
[27:55] Daddy I can't now but God hears my words
[27:59] I'll make everything right I'll make it
[28:01] right yes I
[28:04] will and right then his
[28:06] respiration begin to come back normal
[28:09] and the following Sunday he was up
[28:12] before the church he said I have sinned
[28:14] before God in the presence of this
[28:16] church I refuse to hear the pastor's
[28:18] words I refuse to hear the Deacon here
[28:21] I'm asking the church to forgive me for
[28:22] the evil that I've done like that God
[28:25] has spared my life I tell you he lined
[28:27] up right right that's what it's got to
[28:30] be if you'll just do it God's way now
[28:34] that that seems harsh in everything as
[28:36] we meditate on these things that Paul
[28:38] said but that's how you have a real
[28:40] power God fill the Holy Ghost fill life
[28:43] and that's how you have a holy ghost
[28:45] filled church as you approach it with
[28:47] fear and trembling with Zeal like they
[28:49] had in second Corinthians and then
[28:51] you'll see something God do something
[28:53] God bless you
[29:06] [Music]
[29:07] right
