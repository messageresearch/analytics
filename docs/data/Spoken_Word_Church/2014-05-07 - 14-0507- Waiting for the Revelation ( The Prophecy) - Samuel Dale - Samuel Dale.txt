Ville and NOA is not going to be able to be with us he's he's having a lot of trouble with his um neopac ever how you pronounce those big words are the problem with his feet and he said it was even a burden to uh going down to the grocery store and back so pray for him and you know and hold him up before the Lord and the Lord willing brother uh Douglas will be here preaching for us for the weekend so just remember preaching no excuse me he'll be preaching Saturday night he said I'm coming down and sat down and listen to you Sunday morning I said okay you preach Saturday night I'll try to preach the rest of it but know just remember that remember brother Douglas remember that all right that all the announcements that we've got we generally have something uh now this will be Mother's Day coming up and you know we generally we uh have the Father's Day weekend and we all go up into the mountains together and and have a little time fellowshipping you know for two or three days and uh you know so what we've got is a little surprise for you maybe this coming wife came up with a good idea this coming Sunday to all of the married women because you don't want to say uh mothers because some you know maybe don't have any children but they are potentials and they are still women so they're sisters so we'll have a sisters you know thing something this coming Sunday for each and every one of you and that'll that'll take care of it all right now I've been trying to get something across and once we finish the series is back behind this I told you we were going to just pick some things and talk about it along the way you know and and be able to uh to cover some things and I I had it lined up to go a certain way tonight well I'm not going to be able to probably go that way so you know just bear with me because you know I want to I want to be a help and I want to be one thing I want you and I to see a reality amen of re realization you know who we are and what we're doing amen because what use is it to just go to church and be good and you know a lot of people in the world are doing that today and they'll just pass on and be whatever they are in their time and ages or whatever you know it's between them and the Lord but see we've got to have something real to not just talk about it right brother we'll get to that the Lord willing in the message in a minute but just remember that okay Hebrews 11 father we thank you for everything and We Praise Your Great Name and truly you are God and change not and in being that way we can depend upon you to help us and Aid us be with each one remember the sick among us and you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe it and just have your way Lord in the service tonight and as we speak about you you come on the scene and bring your word to pass among us because we believe it we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness and guide us in you and keep us in Jesus name amen Hebrews 11 very familiar scripture with all of us right now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen now hope the word hope and the Bible it to us it means hoping hoping you know but in the Bible terminologies it's it's something that's real right it's not that you're hoping for it that's it's not something outd that you're hoping right if it is it's not a faith all right see that that's the point I want us to see see so when we read the Bible and we talk about Hope and see against hope or was it Paul was saying about Abraham believed in Hope see it wouldn't wouldn't just a hope well I hope I'm saved you know I hope I no no it's got to be a reality now Faith is the substance of things hope far now remember it's a substance amen whatever you're Desiring that's what faith is right if you can accept it that way the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speak by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him but before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he was maybe will be sometime can be you know that's the way our mind translates it right but that's not what the Bible saying for he that cometh to God must believe that he is right now and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we were talking about you know this past Sunday speaking on the Rapture and talking about that the the word rapture is not even in the Bible it means to be caught away and Paul covers it you know that we'll be caught up to meet the Lord in the hour see it's not something that is um the point I want you to get is my my main thing is it's changed the sermon so I I've got to change my thinking because you know not that I was wrong in what I doing it was just the approach that that came to me to change over to a different way all right but see I'm trying to get you and I to see one thing Faith now is the substance so now you're you're searching for something you're hunting for it you're Desiring it healing salvation whatever well see then you got to come to a place to be able to see that you actually have the substance he said but now now but brother Dale now see that's where our old good old religious ways you know I don't want to say that I'm Healed when I'm not because I don't want to make God a liar you already made him a liar when you won't say what he says he says you're healed right all right so why can't we say that we're healed all right see because Faith then being the substance of that it if you were searching after something you know uh you know remember one comes to mind sister Kathy lost her pocketbook well you know we prayed and you know what our pocketbook came back well see somebody touched God in a situation that it brought to p a substance right and it would have been great if somebody had have called her up on the phone and said well I you know I found your pocketbook he said Glory I found she found my pocket or they found my pocketbook but said I lost it well you you don't have a substance do you are are you understanding it see this person over here had the substance for a little while but they lost the substance right well that's that's the point of what I'm wanting you and I to do brother B said you prayed for you're healed so you have the substance he said but then you let it come back he said and you lose your faith he said really what you lose is your substance he said you still have your confession and you can call that Faith you know but that's not faith that goes on that's a hope that we use as hoping as something where the Bible is not using it that way it's using it as a positive statement you know like when it says I know well that's not well I hope or yeah I know yeah yeah people say yeah I know I know but bring it down to a reality faith is the substance all right now we were talking about the Rapture and we hadn't covered all of it we'll get a little bit more maybe the Lord willing Sunday but we're talking about how that we're being caught up all right now if you can't see it as something real or a tangible something and you know what I mean by tangible I mean that you have it but nobody else can see it if have you ever been healed I mean the Lord spoke to you and you was healed all right now all right see then you had something that nobody else didn't have now they had it for themselves right but they didn't have what you had you had a substance they got a confession amen but like I said then you can lose the confession see the lady would say I've got your pocketbook it's yours I know it's your name in it but I lost it my husband throw it in the trash you know thinking it wouldn't mine you know something happened see what you done you lost a tangible all right now you ever notice brother R said you're saved as long as you keep your confession all right he said as long as you keep your confession all right well then we to keep confessing it I was talking to a lady today getting a haircut I said when you got something that's not a like a caner or something I said then you can you can do different in healing you you can confess your way into it and I said you just start saying by Stripes I'm Healed and you just keep saying by Stripes I'm Healed you know what one day you walk away with what you're confessing because you're saying what God says right but now we found out the Rapture is being called away and I told you that the way I see it the way I believe it I believe the day you got born again that you started a process right that will eventually be made totally manifest in the whole being to come into reality of Redemption all right see then this is the day that we're to do this how long have I preached on recognizing your day in this message to try to get us to see to talk about the things to talk about even the brother randam and the great Miracles and the great signs and wonders that took place in his ministry and I'm not saying this derogatory I'm saying it correctly even with that confession that word he brought he went by the grave now that's not throwing off on him you know people say oh you th no no I'm I'm trying to that's truth isn't it yeah but you don't understand well I know I don't understand that that's why I'm depending on the Lord amen amen now see then if we talk about the Rapture as a process just like the stature of a perfect man he born again at Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God coming on out to The Headstone it's a process in our lives that's taking place on all right now to me then the Rapture is that way it's it's the point that we are being caught up all right now in doing that then we've already as the prophet we brought out Sunday said the Lord Jesus does these three things in his descending outout the voice of the Archangel and the trumpet right you remember that Sunday we were dealing with it all right now the Lord does that in his descending okay but Rapture is going that way what do you want to call it stepping into another dimension whatever you make it but it's being caught up all right so the day we got bornn again we were caught up into as Paul calls it that's why I've got two messages and I'm going with it but Paul calls it Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the new birth puts you and I in Heavenly places where in the soul amen it will bring the body under subjection to that yes but it begins by raising that person spiritually speaking as we'd call it in the soul up into another dimension or whatever you want to call it all right so then it's Heavenly places and he gave us many spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus according to Ephesians 1:3 and see we look at the pyramid and we see those blessings and we see Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience all right we go into Paul and it's love joy peace goodness meekness gentleness Etc spiritual blessings in spiritual Heavenly places now we used to and you know it's not throwing off on the way it's the way we was but we used to our basis of thinking of Salvation was I believe I'm saved I hope I'm saved maybe I'm saved or I believe I'm saved well then you had the others that had the positive attitude you know there are people that are positive there are people that are um middle phase of pro and then there's people that just don't have much you know profession all right now if you asked me when I was in the Baptist had have said was you saved i' said yes cuz I was one of those positive thinkers I was 18 years old before I was converted so it wasn't a point of just you know somebody talking me into it I've told you about it when I told the the people I said I live a better life than your Deacon board lives and you're trying to get me to be saved you need to go back and talk to them you know but the thing of it was in one day I came to a reality of a of a fact that I believe then in being positive all right and not just saying well I hope I'm saved I was PR out in the Baptist Church but was not even through the Born Again experience I've told you about that I got that later but I had a positive attitude or thoughts in my mind about salvation all right but you know yourself that a lot of people never had those positive points so they wavered up and down and in and out and we had one man that every time he'd have a Revival he'd come to the church and he'd go to the Altar and he'd cry and he said I got it this time You' never make it to the second night but I heard one day he finally did well thank God you know I hope he did you know but my point is he got something that night that stirred his heart but yet it never made an anchor in the soul of something real or he wouldn't have been that way we see raised up sitting in Heavenly places by the new birth now listen to what I'm saying you that claim the new birth before you heard of this message and I I believe in it I I believe there were a lot of people had the new birth I can go back and show you where brother Brown said he met people had the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost 50 years before he come along all right I believe in that all right but my point is this do you realize that if you really did receive the new birth now then you didn't have to wait for this message to get the new birth earth right amen you had it and you were sitting in Heavenly places and that's why when you heard the message I believe that all right see then it meant something to you right amen why because you were not just a h Hazard flim flamy or whatever the words would be for Christian as we'd call it that's up and down and in and out and it was at least settled enough on Christianity to go to church to be good we start living right you know paying you tithe living for the Lord serving God see this message didn't bring the New Birth now come on listen to what I'm saying now so hold it right I believe in a birth of the message yes sir but I believe the new birth it came on the day of Pentecost ausa Street Pentecost according to your Prophet 1906 where everybody know what I'm saying was the same holy ghost that fell on the de of Pentecost that's what he said so now you argue with brother Brown you can say you don't believe it all you want to so if you say you don't believe it you think he's wrong right you say I just can't see that well then you mean he's wrong and you're right cuz you can't see right but you see that new birth that you received brought those Pentecostals who really had the new birth into Heavenly places justification brought Luther and the people of that day who received that new birth into Heavenly places Wesley Baptist Methodist Presbyterian whatever Heavenly places by the new birth all right so then God already as I've tried to explain to you when he gave you that new birth he laid claim on that body that you're living in that's right that's why we don't believe in getting a new body and on another body some different body we believe in this body made new all right now in that then the Rapture started the day you received Jesus Christ all right now I didn't say it was over with right because it put you in Heavenly places all right now in the Bible then was written a prophecy now that's where I told brother Joe and him to put waiting for the Revelation the prophecy on to the people where they can listen you know until the Bible is made known to you it's only a prophecy that's right I don't care how much you can read how much you can talk about you can talk about one God you can give me all the scriptures you can show me all the doings you you know you put every little little dot to every a little thing you know but until it's revealed it's a prophecy all right there was a prophecy put in the Bible by a great man and remember now how I explain prophecy to a prophet I attempted to you know over time like this when non saw chariots josling in the streets he saw 2014 you know uh 85 downtown Atlanta you know and if it have been anything that he could have explained that with he would have wrote down Buicks and O mobiles and Cadillacs Etc running like lightning with the headlights on and you know all right but yet he couldn't explain it that way so he had to write it down the way he his words of that day so he saw chariots joshing in the street but you know to him it was real all right see I believe when a prophet brings the Scriptures it may not be even real to anyone else cuz he may be speaking of a future event but to to him it's a reality do you understand to him it's real all right and that's why brother around would say I'm not saying he's coming said I'm saying he's here all right a reality of realities or or a revelation into it a substance but you see he spoke like Paul spoke so there was a prophecy in the Bible now do you follow my line up you had a new birth Luther had it wesler had it Pentecost had it every age had the new birth every age had the holy ghost in the New Birth all right but there was something sealed up in the word and it was was there in first Thessalonians that would be pointing Paul would be pointing 2,000 years right to the end time but the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout well now that was different the I'm I'm having to stay away from some of the messages that that I got but remember on the coming of the Lord you got a lot of scriptures to be lined up and if you get them lined up wrong you got a problem right so we got to get everything lined up and to see it correctly to understand it they had that new birth down to the ages they were resurrected sitting in Heavenly places even those early church ages up to to Columba was up into here where it says holy spirit but now not The Headstone because the prophet said it wouldn't all right but he said it will come well that was a prophecy when Paul said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout you know what I don't doubt what he didn't see the very end time right now I I know I'm funny the way I think and that's all right for me to say that Paul saw the end time he didn't necessarily see everything transpiring all of the doing I'm not talking like that I'm talking about that he saw the situation he knew something was going to happen I believe if You' have said Paul you have just said that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an arang angel in a trumpet now what do you mean you know what he said what I said you know right he said what I said I said the Lord would descend but what did we have for 2,000 years we don't know we don't understand a shout oh you know B of an AR Angel great sweep and a Trum but if you said Paul is that what you mean he just said no I mean what I said I said the Lord shall descend right well even though it said that who emphasized that point you know come on go through your your Scholars and things see if they emphasize that point but you're come a prophet he used that scripture I've looked at him over about two or three weeks now this is scanning through you know and looking at things like that don't tell them how many times he preached and use the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel a trumpet but then one day he made an outstanding statement that brought a Clarity to what he was saying he said Jesus does all three of these in his descending well you know what that was what Paul said right Paul said the Lord will descend from the heaven now let's bring Paul and brother randam together and make it in terminology of the day he said Paul what did you see he said I saw the Lord descend said one day he's coming and said not his first coming cuz said that's over with right we'll get back to these things later he is first com remember he comes three times he comes one time to get his bride he comes second time I mean one time to redeem his bride second time to get his bride third time with his bride all right he covers three times but there's more comings than those three you got to coming to Israel you got the coming to 144,000 you got the coming to different situations that are in the Bible and if you don't get them lined up correctly then you you you won't follow it which Paul if you could have got him to have said it he said one of these days there's going to be a message come forth that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen that's right and said that will be what I tried to say of his descending see but when God said write it down he said put it down as a shout well you know Paul writes down shout but Paul is sitting there knowing what he's doing and then he says there'll be a voice of an archangel now we're taking Paul and brother brandom and bringing it to the day do you understand me Paul would say the voice of the Archangel you said Paul who's the Archangel he would have said what do you mean who's the Archangel he's the angel of the Covenant he said Jesus Christ he said I just got through telling you the Lord I just got through saying Jesus will descend with a message and said Jesus was the one that raised the dead he said well how do you know that's right because when I go over and read the Rapture message that's exactly what the prophet said took place and will take place read the rapture he said the same loud voice that raised Lazarus well well I thought Archangel would be some kind of doing something I'm not throwing no Stones I just say things and then but that's what everybody's got it all figured out but we're going to go back in the scriptures Paul would you you agree let's see what let me see if I can get to quote but R said if Luther was here today he' believe this message now that's verbatim but I'll be glad to find the statement part of it in order to be sensible enough to know it without having to have it as a direct quote you ought to know that's the truth amen right Paul saw the Lord descending with a message and the Archangel would the resurrection and there'd be a trumpet to call the people and that trumpet would have to deal with dealing with taking us to the Rapture taking Israel to the right come on a trumpet all right now brother brandom and Paul is saying the same thing but yet when Paul said it it was hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent right but revealed to the prophet because that's scripture right Amos 3 and 7 or whatever I believe that's right isn't it he does nothing but he revealed his secret to the prophets all right when that Prophet was preaching could he tell us something different from the Bible no he was telling us what the Bible said so Paul said Jesus does all three of these things as he descends but yet in his statement then and writing it down it's not that he was trying to be deceiving but he wrote what the Lord wanted him to write right a shout voice Archangel a trumpet we see BR brandom didn't have to come to change the writing of the Bible but what did he say that was to be he said it says what it means and means what it says so that was our trouble it never said there'd be a great big holl take place hey can't you just see all oh everybody here now it's on internet everybody around the world could hear the voice of the Lord through the internet that's not the Bible then we try to figure out the Archangel and what's that then we try to figure out the trumpet and what's that but listen to what I'm getting at the day you receive that new birth it raised you into Heavenly places now listen to the way I say it you heard a message or you could have never been saved are you with me you heard a message come on see then you were told by Paul believe in your heart confess with your mouth there's nobody ever been saved there's nowhere in the Bible that the holy ghost ever fell that there wasn't a message being preached right all right well see then for you to get the new birth you heard the message I I believe that this man right over here in a a non-denominational church could be used of God to preach and a person could get born again but the problem is they're not going to stay with him right that's not throwing off nobody I put the credit to where it is and what it's doing he' be counted for leading that sheep to Christ but the Sheep has to go on to get some sheep food right so you had to hear a message before you could be born again right well why would there be any trouble then what would be the trouble of believing that the Lord would descend with a message and that that message would be his actual coming amen it's not physical the new birth is not physical is it no it's a spiritual happening and see then we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places by the new birth right we heard a message to get born again so then when it come that this message would come forth now we know and believe as I said prophecy Paul what are you saying Paul putting all together in his language of his speech he said we now have the new birth we now have Christ in you the hope of glory we now have the life that I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God what said Paul you seem to be pointing to a future time when you said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven he said that's what I'm doing I'm pointing to 2,000 years later maybe not telling how far or whatever and you say well Paul all right now you've prophesied or something what should we do you know he said well let me just turn over here and let Jude tell you what to do said because he believes what I believe all right Jude what should we do he said earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered done to the Saints let's let Peter talk about this Rapture this caught away Peter says being born again add to your faith virture knowledge Temperance patience godliness a preparation you remember I mentioned it the other day because brother Mo preached that years ago and it really was outstanding to me waiting a place to be waiting now when you receive the new birth at Faith sure we'll go with it that you get a portion of these things okay you get a portion of love but that's not the love of The Headstone not that the love of The Headstone is something different a different thing it's just more of it right right amen all right and Paul says there's going to be a falling away right that was a prophecy these things in other words he's explaining these things can't take place until a fallen away comes well you know how I preach that I see the biggest falling way is right now for the people that are falling away from this message that used to they would not say one word against a prophet now they're telling how wrong he is that's the falling away because remember to fall away you got to be somewhere to fall from right I can't fall off the top of the house I'm not up there but I can fall off of this little 6 in platform right but you understand what I'm saying I'm taking the Bible and letting it say what brother randam has said and letting brother randam say what the Bible has said see then here he comes here comes a man on the scene in the 40s 30s and things and he begins to preach and he begins to tell us about these things the faith of the fathers the great things he begins to preach those things unto us and he can he goes with Jude of earnestly contending for the faith how many times has he used that and as I said a moment ago how many times does he use the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of Archangel and trumpet out of Thessalonians he's believing in something in a reality but yet he knows there's something wrong he comes up in there pretty close to the seals and I'll find you the messages but he said I've lost the love for the people I said Lord help me he comes in and he starts telling the visions and the things that that people dreams had had in the thing right prior like in the sir what time is it and he gets over after a while and he makes this statement he said if this is not that said I'm going to just go into them mountains I'm paraphrasing it with a lot of messages right you know it's right I'm going going into them mountains and taking neither food nor water and I ain't coming out of there until God speaks to me he said because you can't go no I can't go no further it gets on spoken words Original Seed he says Lord this is paraphrasing almost perfect verb Lord I got him out on the limb What Can I Do Lord said pick up your pen and write he says and as of as yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled how many times did he preach Malachi 4 between before 1962 How many times did he talk about it being fulfilled yet the Lord said it's not fulfilled yet well what was he going to do you he doesn't know where to go and what to do he said he didn't I'm taking neither food nor water he said I can't go on this way but yet the Lord made him and he sees the great things or the opening of the seals the great points that he goes through he goes through all of his ministry that we could spend hours of growth developments coming up through to see what he was doing but to run it through in a hurry he gets over and right before his death and he preaches a message called The Rapture that's where he said Jesus does all these three things in his descending but you want to go back and run your computer just run shout voice Archangel trumpet and see if brother Ram didn't talk about Jesus being the Archangel see if he didn't talk about the shout being the message that wasn't the first time he spoke of it and he talked about a trumpet he even said I believe it's 10 virgins he said a gospel trumpet or something we mentioned the trumpet and he tells you he said Israel was always gathered by the trumpets but you see it became a reality now to Paul it was a prophecy because it could not be fulfilled did you listen to what I said now he saw it to him it was reality but nobody could make that manifest why because it was a prophecy when that Prophet came out there and speak speaking that day it was no longer longer a prophecy to him did you see where I said it to him he was the only one in the world that understood according to records They said that he asked them on the future home how many of them understood what he said and had a while said he said I can count on my hands how many understood about the future home that's a Simple Plan of Redemption but get what I'm talking about now right in the ending of the winding up his ministry he speaks of something and I'll listen to what I'm saying now and you'll get it reason it changed the part in my message I'll get the rest of it later when he began to speak that message that day it was no longer a prophecy to him it was a reality now listen because at that time the message had already went forth he only preached a few sermons after the Rapture message the message had already been preached now watch come from a prophecy to reality that's what I'm trying to explain a prophet when he sees something it's a reality he's standing there in his message so I've asked you get in that message read it read it read it read it listen to it it's hard to follow him sometimes in the way he's saying things but he's standing there talking about a message well one of these days brother brandham you going to bring a message remember man said to him one day he said with your ability you could write a 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation he said trying to trap me it's because you can't add to the word so now he couldn't had to Paul right here comes a man then that's already progressed into what he stood and said he said Jesus does all three of his these in his descending in other words he could have said if you listen to the message you'll hear him say this words but not in out of the open to make it to me why because it's not to the world Amen he's standing there knowing that three and a half years before then he started a message a message you know what then that's why he could say Jesus is not coming he's here to him the Lord Jesus descended right he was standing there present tense 1965 or whatever you want to call it knowing the message had already come and that a part of the Rapture had already happened then he turns around and he starts speaking of the voice of the Archangel and he said the same voice that raised Lazarus is the voice of the Archangel he knew the word he had already brought had brought Jesus Christ to the Earth not in a Corporal body no you don't do that until we meet him in the A and go to the Millennium right but he'll become visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go into Rapture come on he's standing there had already walked through and probably maybe halfway through the sermon he begins to realize that the message had already been brought and in that message is the voice of the Archangel there is no voice of the Archangel outside the message of the word of God what are you looking for theor of the Archangel is Jesus Christ who's going to raise the dead now I know a lot of people's got their ideas about raising the dead and who's going to do it and what's going to take place that's all right that's your business I just stay where I've been all these years were the message if it hasn't brought Jesus Christ to you that this Prophet brought you need to go back and listen that's have you ever noticed a message brother Brown called it raising Jesus from history now what does he mean raising Jesus from history you mean there was a time that the name Jesus wouldn't never you wouldn't even used at all or anything are we that dumb what does it mean raising Jesus from history when we took him and made him a trinity we made a historical God out of him and to see him correctly and who he really is he's raised from history into a reality the same Lord Jesus that spoke back there will be here to speak again right it won't be just you and me folks well I've never believed that you know a lot of people thought boy bless God one of these days I'll say it I said you can't say it to you get it that's right I said that in 60 something 68 I I can still say it today everybody saying one of these days we going to speak that word I said you can't speak it till you get it and what I meant then was just what I mean now until it becomes a reality of a revelation from Hebrews 11 the substance when brother R said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying the substance of all Mighty God outside of the Corporal body is on the Earth where he was at now what about it but yet what are we looking for well brother so and so is going somebody one of these everybody's got their own ideas ain't they but I hope you understand what I tried to say tonight Paul said Jesus Will descend from heaven one day and he'll do all three of these things he'll bring a message he'll bring he'll be the voice of the Archangel and he'll sound a trumpet it'll carry us out of here call us up you said no he didn't say it that way was that the way brother randam said it then that's what Paul said right are you listening if that's right according to what brother brandham say and that's what Paul said but it was a mystery but there comes a time when all Mysteries are fulfilled there comes a time when all prophecy is fulfilled now let me explain a prophecy for second you know with all of our being all of our thinking all of our hopes all of our our U life is built on one thing it's built on whether the sun rises tomorrow or not right you know the sunrising tomorrow is a prophecy because it's not here once it gets here it's today you remember what I was trying to bring the I am the everpresent for eternity all of that you know Sister Gil when we step into tomorrow and the sun rises and brother G dick gets up and he goes down to Hardies or Wendy's or wherever he goes and gets him a biscuit it's real but today that's a prophecy that's how close we're living that's right that's how close we're living if you're following me the point is one thing Paul said it brother brandom explained what it was now swallow see the day he explained that in 1965 you know what you and I received a prophecy that's right of a future event amen he said how do you why do you say that you making it positive you know it was positive to him it wasn't positive to you and I so it's a prophecy but once it comes off of that page into your heart can I quote brother brandom it can be questioned as long as it lays in the book is that the way he said it but he said when it comes off them pages into your heart he said it can't be questioned no more why because you got a substance church that's what I've tried to preach for 45 years the past three months I've dealt more on that than anything is to try to get you and I to see the positive point of where we are and that we must see who we are and what we're doing and not just talk about it and go to church and be good and all that's wonderful but we done that when we had that new birth we done that when we was the Baptist the Methodist the Presbyterian the things right I didn't come in this message to learn not to drink alcohol and smoke a cigarette this message didn't tell me not to Tar down my neighbors pasture fence if I tore down his fence and Mama found it out I was going to go get the cows and put them up and put up the fence then I going to get a whooping right would you see brother Brandon people are say brother Brandon brought the me boy it brought me from this and it brought me from that well amen if it did right right I'm not saying that's wrong but the new birth ought have took care of a lot of things there shouldn't be anything in the new birth where you talk about drinking gambling smoking running around with women cussing stuff like there shouldn't there shouldn't be anything anything that in the New Birth even if just Luther's messenger the just shall live by faith you wouldn't have that he wouldn't want to live like the devil and go down and pay his Penance that was the things he was against when he seen that you I shall live by faith but are you with me resurrected sitting in Heavenly places you know that Ephesians 1 and 20 says that Jesus was raised up and sit in Heavenly places at the right hand right the power just in the New Birth it brings us power just a new birth brings us power you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost ghost has come upon you and you'll be my Witnesses no I'm trying to explain it church that we look back and say this is that when this is not even that there was a day when brother randam walked out there and he in that message he probably stopped and he says Lord the messages already went forth you know the Lord Jesus one day walked into the temple took the book turned over Isaiah he read binded up to brokenhearted he said this day this scripture is fulfilled amen well you know what it wasn't fulfilled the day before right why because it was not a possession of Eternity a a revelation unto him come on you say what well the Bible said he grew in Grace and knowledge so go ahead but listen church just because the prophet preached it doesn't mean we have it right it's when the same God speaks to our hearts from what he said right God wrote my quoting brother brandom God wrote Moses interpreted God wrote by Paul brother randam interpreted now wait a minute wait a minute just don't jump before I get through okay he couldn't bring anything different from the original interpretation so he turned us back to the original interpretation CU brother brandham could not interpret it was the Holy Ghost in brother brandham that could speak that's why like I said when he got on the spoken words of Ral seed he was out on a limb and stopped in no way that he could go any further and the Lord said pick up your pen and right he says as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled as of yet now listening to me I'll quit as of yet the message had not progress into the position to be the shout that Paul saw come on I believe brother brandom I believe what he was doing and he was a prophet and nobody stands before a prophet but in brother Brown's early Ministry read statue of perfect man and see if he don't say on it I just got this the other day and that's actually added to your faith virtue not if you read it so you know what the before that other day he didn't know that but yet go back to uh intervail is the old title where he said God wants to use every being of your fiber he wants to feel you he wants you to walk as instrumentality of Christianity but you see one day it went from just being the new birth and he started teaching the statue of a perfect man Faith virtue knowledge temper coming up but then one day when he had gotten that done because that was what was written in the Bible the faith of the fathers and when that was completed then the Lord says Malachi 4 is not fulfilled three and a half years later he's standing preaching or somewhere thereabouts and he said the Lord has descended from heaven with a shout Jesus has done all three of these here in his descending we see we're still looking out there that's all I've tried to say what you think about me forget it just take what say it my whole life has been based on not what's out there I get sick and tired of people talking about what's coming I know there's things to come yes but when all you preach is things to come things to come one day one day I've got it already there we'll pick it up Sunday where brother around says our problem we're living below our privilege what is our privilege to know that these things has already happened and US believe it amen to know that the word has done been brought to you and I are we looking for another Prophet to come what are we looking for someone to straighten out everything I found anything need to be straightened myself I've been at it 40 something years and I've put out the challenge they put it all out to the people do right R around made these mistakes R around I challenge anybody in the world come show me where he made a mistake now don't be stupid or silly like I told sister Barbara's husband that day when he told me there was contradictions in the Bible I said please don't be cuz it's a verse very intelligent man he is and I said please don't be to the point of saying they was two Blind Men and there was one blind man which one is it one or two I said was two different men writing and what they saw oh I don't mean he's dumb he's very very intelligent intelligent intelligent man but his point was that David had one scripture said he had 4,000 chariots and the other scripture said he had 40,000 chariots which one did he have I said he had 40,000 he had 36 of them in one place and 4,000 in the other one I said don't be silly with contradictions that's not contradictions that's different people writing show me where brother Brandon was contrary to the Bible am that's right amen cuz our only hope is that he was right come on we've walked away from organized religion right do we claim that we claim we come out of denominations and this and that and the other and we' walked away from them and don't want to go back that's right well then we've got all our hopes based on one thing amen if read a right somebody better get here in a hurry that's right am oh my I like what brother randam said when he was talking about Peter and him saying this is that or one to them or Peter said it I think this is that it was spoken of he said if this ain't that let me keep this till that gets here well for 45 or almost 50 years now I've pressed one thing get ready that's it we got to be ready for what's coming we're not changed yet we look at each other no problem with it so then there's something to come but if we're not standing here ready what's coming will do us no good right we we got to know what's coming you think the devil ain't going to try to impersonate everything my Lord I told him that 40 something years ago I said the devil's going to do everything he can to impersonate the things brother brandom talked about in his ministry well you better believe one thing if God starts moving Satan moves cuz he's got to throw off I had one in here I'll get back to it Sunday where brother around said discrediting God's word that Satan's attacked he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here far Satan will be powerless before her of course we don't need to study the message we just wait brother so and so come along somebody come along and explain it to us when we what's he going to explain to you if you don't know and how are you going to know where brother R said it or not it's like the brother he said told me Sunday the HEK there I gave it to you excuse me I gave a book I need keep that one brother Paul the Black Brothers just been here two or three times I supposed to give it to him but you can have that I'll give him another cuz Hank wants him too but I told him I said what do you think you know he said listen he said while you was preaching said I sat there and my wife saw him counting or somebody did somebody told me sister Anna so I'm counting and I said you know you got seven ads you better look add to your faith virture don't add Faith cuz he make eight add to your fa said he was sitting there counting well you know what it meant something he said I'd like to have that book he said because I believe the Lord spoke to me about something that we need to grow up in that that we start at the bottom I thought I know people that's been in this message 50 years that don't know that come on musicians let's stand listen church I know I've been horrible everything in the world but I ain't one thing I drive for one thing if it's drive if it's for hard for me to drive I'll drive to try my best to pound it into you and I I'm not looking for the Lord to come I'm looking at his coming I'm not looking for a message to come I've heard the message that has come I know where the Archangel is at he's on Earth and it's Jesus Christ Living in his people right and the trumpet is simply taking us up the calling upward the trumpet when are we going to see that those things had already taken place but yet we're still looking for it well I don't see this and I don't see that that's why for years folks used a brother used to come here and all he done was went around and wrote articles and things and I'm not against him I loved him do anything I did for him anything in the world for him but I beg God to please not do nothing while he was here you say brother Dale I know it I'm sorry well I begged him I said God don't do nothing when that man is here because if you do he's going to announce to the world this that or the other and it won't be on account of the word I said people to start flocking into here just because of something that that's happened the Dead's raised the sick healed this that and the other I said don't do it while is's here he said you're I know it I'm sorry but I believe one thing I believe God has Vindicated through right here in this little church building all we have need of to believe a Rapture is in process cuz we've seen the sick healed we've seen the dead raised that's what Paul asked me in the office he said you said you had seen the dead raised I said yes sir of five or six times we've seen it he said you mean literally raised I said yes sir he said I thought you was just talking about spiritually raised or something you know that we raised up and the dead that Sinners had raised up become Christians I said no no we have seen the dead raised but you don't have to worry about now it ain't go it go out on the world the internet if it went out years ago they'd have flocked in here but it won't now my people's already got their mind set they've already got it set on this what they believe and you know what they say well the Bible says if a man give you a sign and it come to pass and he takes you to another God don't believe him and that Lula church is trying to carry you to another God because we believe in two Lords Two Souls seven Thunder virtues you know River Jordans and we're taking you to this God they're taking you to another God don't worry about it it ain't going to build this church it ain't going to fill it up if I thought that we'd already have a 500,000 seat capacity but I know we're not going to need what we got because some are not going to be able to stand just slowly grinding and they'll find some excuse for leaving what is it go ahead brother 194 in the red book day of redemption amen nations are breaking Israel waking the signs in the Bible for the the Gentiles day numbered were Horrors encumbered eternity soon will unfold the day of redemption is here men's are failing for fear I like the way Hank says thing it's blunt did you mean to say I'm my father one I said Yep by the new birth I'm my father one well
