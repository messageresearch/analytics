nervous when you freeze I said no I've never been nervous and so I get so nervous I get so sick I almost throw up I said well brother let me tell you something and I go somewhere to minister I said you know when I walk in my dad's home I'm not nervous are your kids nervous when they come to see you or kids are you nervous when you come see your dad right no you're not nervous when you get up to the door you know you said we're going to see we're going to see uh you know our brother here brother rolling one we're gonna go see Dad oh no this is just family it is an extension of the family I just got back from the Philippines I've spent three weeks over there and I've been back for two weeks and and I told him I said just family doesn't matter where they're from doesn't matter how they speak you know what country they're from we're all family we should be all playing God delicious settle down relax you're nervous don't be nervous I'm just part of the family I'm just one of the crazy Brothers you admit yes we all have them amen like from Mike here yeah it's the odds one of them Lacy sits on the front row I think maybe that's where they can watch him because we had a house of Lord if you got your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Matthew and get started now if I pause for a moment I am collecting my boss because I am a southerner and it takes people to think but brother Louise is interpreting for the for the uh Guatemalans there I didn't know that blue Guatemala Alabama yeah Walton Alabama chapter 17. don't have all my clothes down here it takes a lot for me to come it's a big entourage you know you have to take care of me so I didn't pay him the same man so you only need to help them in Matthew chapter 17. we will start with first eight unless about eight before we get started did Heavenly Father we pray Lord today yes Lord you would absolutely be the preeminent one in this service do not be a bystander to record our thoughts and actions because lord they're all against you but father you come down and you take over this service yes give me the speaker you be the hero you be the one that does the revealing Lord you be the one that takes over lord from the front to the back we ask your blessings on the people here father the the family members that we we have here in Mobile and the ones that from different parts and yes we pray father that you would bless them today yes brother Matthew Warren bless him Wednesday that have a part in the service board all the way from the front to the back and she'll give them a special blessing amen we pray that you'll be with us today Lord give us the words to speak if there be any sick among us you said you sent your word in heels yes yes and delivered them from their destruction so as the word goes forward many times Lord we've seen you heal people just sitting in their seats father truly that's the way you want it for that's the Gentile way is to just believe and it will happen father forgive us of our sins and many mistakes that we make against you Lord we pray that you would be with the church back home Lord we always thank you that you've been with a missionary on the foreign amen Matthew 17 verse 8. we all know what happened here this was mouth Transfiguration but Jesus comes down off of the mountain and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw an old man say Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples obviously were confused they ask him saying wild things they described to the last must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them he lies truly shall first come and restore all things bless you because remember we're going a little bit further and we see that Jesus was speaking of John the Baptist in that scripture but that scripture has a twofold meaning yes and we're talking about now a resurrection and the son of man Jesus said until the sun man be risen again do not speak of this visions of no man so we're going to speak on today though we're going to take a little line uh you know there's many ways to get to New York there's not just one way in a several ways but we're all going to get to the same spot but we may take a little different rap so we're going to speak on today a masterpiece family because obviously in my wife and I were talking on the way you see people that and and not saying anything about denominations uh the people remember brother rounds said do not say anything about the people they're good people it's just the denomination that's got a bound right but remember we had to have a prophet in the end time he come and indicted a generation yes or the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ those people are are worshiping a god of 2 000 years ago they got him off the cross but turned right around and put him back on the cross right amen amen amen so now we see here though that this scripture is being fulfilled because of Son of Man obviously if they crucified him the second time to them he's dead right again the man he's dead absolutely amen you see how the deception is but but Jesus was prophesying until the son of man be risen again amen from the dead yeah man so we're looking at not a physical Resurrection today but a spiritual Resurrection yes all right resurrecting City in the Bible says and how many places all right so we're going to look and see because remember he didn't say until the Son of God be risen again right he said until the son of man be rich amen right because there is a different dispensation it's the same God yes it's the same God but in another manifestation now look the son of God was back in the beginning amen amen amen God was back in the beginning son of man didn't come until 2000 years ago right man that's right so we're looking down as we say again not at a physical Resurrection but a spiritual Resurrection but in turn once that spiritual Resurrection happens it's going to create a natural Resurrection that's right the graves are going to open well actually the graves won't open because it's going to be a secret amen Paul was so full of the Holy Ghost that today that they cut his head off you know when he stepped over over in that sixth Dimension he didn't have to pick his head up off the ground and put it back on his shoulder so that theophany was so strong at the time and there he stood Eternal being with God until I believe that the same way with the resurrection you're not going to have to dig him out of the ground they're going to come up and they're going to be in that glorified body right and if I start preaching Slow Me Down come on Louise you okay back then okay all right let's read the first quote let's get this started here we're going to look to and see two things we're going to look at the Son of God in the son of land is everybody okay all right so one's got to be risen again Son of God can't die Amen brother some God can't die man so a man had to die amen all right brother uh Jesus was very specific when he said the son of man must be risen against right from the dead all right so let's look at the first quote and Watchman one of the night 1960 and I'm going to read this kind of slow I'm gonna we're gonna be here for just a little bit because there's no second service so we're going to pile two anymore amen all right you got anywhere else you need to go no sir okay all right I know what the ball game or something long you might want to watch it you know I told somebody the other day we can sit for four hours on a deer stand and never moved if people go fill up a stadium up in Alabama and what do they do they sit there like that no no they screen their lungs out they wear weird clothes yeah and I'm sorry if you think this is where this is a Philippines it's just called the Barone and there's nothing wrong with a baroque amen because I don't like those ghosts of bondage around my head and I told the Churchill the baby brother Bob or somebody said you don't like me preaching in your pajamas I said look the Bible say we're not so aware didn't say about wearing ties and Glory we're gonna wear robes yeah let's get used to it now we're gonna wear a rogue amen and over the Matthew you don't mind I know he does I wish I had one okay I'll send you one all right okay Watchmen water the knife 1960. let's just enjoy the word of God today okay it will be a little bit slow today and just bear with me for our brothers here and also for what I've got to color yeah brother Brown said Washington part of the night he said the same Ministry that the sun went down then the same light he went down in it's coming again in the resurrection power and The Morning Star is reflecting that life then we cry Watchman what of the night hallelujah hallelujah the morning cometh in the night also now we're in the dark time the layout of seeing Church age man lukewarm not able to stand the things of God but remember we're to be called out of that this is me talking we're called out of that exactly right Andrew what the perfect life yeah brother Randall also says next and Abraham restored and then we'll get started because look if if if the son of man has to be risen again we've got to track all the way back and go back before right around says back before the Eternal we've got to go back and see how the god brings a grip for people because remember he said it's not going to rise again for himself right he's Rising again for you he's Rising again for his children that's right and I hope that you're part of that family thank you amen uh I didn't have a choice being Adele I was born Adele amen amen Abraham restored 1961. notice watch what what what it is God in human flesh and God would represent himself again in human flesh just before the coming of the son of man what flesh you're fine amen My Flesh word of God God coming down from heaven God longing for Fellowship yes how people it seems to be that there's no there's so much mental theology about it you fail to get the discernment of the spirit that's right amen you're gonna fail to get it but God you say oh that was just in brother Brown I beg your partner this is not a one-man show he bought a one-man message there we there will never be a message like that before but I thought now it was coming to the people amen that's the way I believe that's it brother amen I I see people they they they're looking for something to come it's like my dad always says he said for six thousand years man has been trying to prove that God's in heaven but for six thousand years God's been trying to prove it he never left the Earth amen are we going to heaven or is having him Hey listen we're just going to step over in the sixth Dimension God's going to clean this thing off we're going to step right back in here man hey don't remember what we lost in the garden when God's going to restore well what do we have in the garden Adam and Eve was the god of the earth amen amen right that's right that's a problem with Satan Satan so Eve said you'll be like God she should have looked at him and said I'm already in God that's right amen amen right I'm already in God Amen so you'll be like going if Adam would have been there he just said no I am gone amen thank you manifest in another form and that's exactly why Adam was that's right so without him being that way guess what you and I to be restored back have got to become the same way amen amen you've got to come back to that my brothers and sisters back to the beginning or the original because remember Redemption is not replacement that's right is that right whatever we lost in the garden that's what we're going back to yeah and before the fall Adam and Eve walk before God with no fear they talked to their daddy every day amen that's right with no fear first time happening in the garden what was the first thing Adam said after the fall I was afraid yes and answer we got to get rid of that fear the Fear Factor is this flesh that's right amen amen just a little bit we'll see though that God uses that flaw yes to Perfection because you remember people let me give you a little hint God always wanted to meet his children in human flesh amen yes Adam and Eve were in human flesh when God talked to them in the cool of the day amen amen so we're going back to that yeah amen yeah but we're just gonna have to take change because remember this was brought by Mom and Dad not by God Almighty right the way it should have been so let's go back into the beginning let's go to one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible again this is one 26 and 27 brothers and everything started in in book dances right yeah that's right and let's break this down because we have got to look where this masterpiece family came from you know if I was the looking brother Berlin um I'm sure he's got a family album bigger than most it probably looks like a book of life we can laugh a little bit Kim hey yeah probably that's it but you know what I'm not in it why I'm his brother but when they have a family reunion why do they call why don't you call me when we have your family reunion wow I'm not part of your family physically amen amen right same way with God he's not going to invite the devil's kids to the family reunion that's right that's right man he's only going to buy his children amen God's not going to adopt the devil's kids are going to adopt his children amen amen those Devil's kids didn't come from him that's right that's what we're going back to Genesis one and let's read Genesis one 26 through verse 28. let's break this down for just a minute everybody all right say amen amen got to see this origin of this masterpiece family because you know where it's going to culminate right right here that's right amen the devil's going to be destroyed here the reason the difference in the denomination of the world they think we're going to get something bad you got to have something here to get there with amen all right say he's going to be destroyed Redemption doesn't happen in heaven Redemption happens on Earth okay all right so we're all right now just having a family reunion today amen the origin of this masterpiece family Genesis 126 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them something plural yes sir I think in Alabama they teach them as plural rights there is plural okay all right and let them have white demand amen oh the fish of the scene over the foul the air and over the cattle and over all the earth now this is God speaking so it's God comes to pass that's right amen the Eternal thoughts of God listen you and I can change our mind but God cannot change he has one thought and that thought is eternal he has no wasted mood amen you and I have a lot of wasted mood God does not have any ways to move and he says that one time it's going to happen so here's God now watch what he's doing he's over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created in him male and female created in them amen and God blessed them now whatever this dream is or whatever God is doing he's already blessing amen amen amen God bless them and God said unto them so he's speaking to them yes amen be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it yes amen I like that amen they have dominion over the fish of the scene over the fall of the United over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so let's break it down for that but let's read what brother Randall says in Christ The Mystery of God revealed 1963. yes because now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve that's right and he had a motive in doing it amen that's it right he had a motive in doing it yes man amen why he was possible let me just explained that he was father he wanted to be impossible without children you can't be a father that's right that's right amen you can't be a father without having children right now so the attribute of father was getting ready to be displayed here in Genesis 1 26. he had a motive in doing in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star out of molecule or anything he was God but he exactly wasn't gone at that time because God is an object to worship and there was nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love and him was to be father and him was to be son and him was to be Savior and he wants to be a Healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were already in God Amen well that's God's great plan it took a prophet of God to go back into the mind of God and to see exactly what was going on I mean exactly didn't listen to us Amen brother and sister this message they you may you may hear somebody say there's flaws in this message but let me tell you something the essence of this message is absolutely the mind of God made my life there's nothing with it the wrong is here and it's not here right that's what I believe yeah it is I don't believe there's any flaw in God Amen right and there's not another Messenger to come so this is it thank you Lord amen we're done for it we think there's something else coming all right so let's break this down just a little bit because looking in at Genesis 1 26 you're looking it says God created well in our human mind we look at the word created and we think well there's nothing and then God created when I look if this is the part of God and it was created it had a beginning it's going to have to have an ending that's right so this word created is not exactly the way you see we see it I'm going to explain that because remember this Genesis 1 26 man is an expression of God himself right amen amen not another person that's right amen amen as an expression of God himself and God said let us make man in our image so God created man in his own image so what's going to look like look like a human right amen he's not a he's not a Casper the Friendly Ghost he's not a blob he's not he's not a yeah sure he manifests himself in light and all these different things and then clouds but not human that's right he's a person only human praise God well if he's not then you're not right because I think you said right here he created us any damage amen amen all right so God created now that word created in the great means to shape fashion not and so because watch in the Book of Genesis we see the word god 30 times in Genesis 1. now that word expressed in Genesis 1 of God is Elohim self-existing one right right so now he's he's creating something off of himself and he's still God Amen that's right amen so this must be a part of God Amen yes not a separate identity from God Amen but another part of God that he's getting ready to express and if you're a part of God and you have to be Eternal amen amen nothing there's nothing in God if it's not Eternal amen amen that's right man so if this is the part of God then it's Eternal you say well well preacher how are you going to get that word created you know there was a car in the Garden of Eden right Michael saying amen amen there was a car in the garden to me all cars were in the garden of me that's right yep right what did man do Man created right right our fashion our form he took all the elements that were already here and as everybody understands what happened Amen brother this was in the Garden of Eden so there's nothing on this Earth that wasn't in the earth to start with that's right amen God put everything in the earth so so Man created the car by taking all the plastic and the Rubber and the metal and all these oars and all these things put together and so what does man do man just took something that was already here yes and brought something into view that you could see amen same way with God right we were always with God Amen we had it wasn't a time when we wasn't with them and they said my children were always in me amen yes sir amen well if you get a revelation that's all right amen but now look so God created our formed man what did he do he brought something so that someone can see or understand he created man in his own image in the image of God created in him male and female created in them and God what bless them now remember the word image the word image is a lightness or a reflection yeah if you look in the mirror you don't see I don't see this brother I see him without because that's the image that's projected into the mirror so that's the way God was because I believe when God went down and talked to Adam and Eve before the fall I believe Adam will look at him and say man I look just like it I guess they'll start my day amen what do you think it sounds like that's my dad amen and God looks down at Adam and says that's my boy he walks and talks just like me amen if I like what brother Elise was preaching his church the other day he said uh Adam was so in tune with God that that when Adam you know Adam starts naming the animals God's going no no no no no don't paint that elephant no no no uh when Adam said that's an elephant God said that's exactly what I was thinking man that's exactly what I'm about it back to when we speak it's exactly right now the problem is is we filter it down and say what we want exactly we say what we want to say and all right God's already said amen so we got to take what God's already said get it down here so you and I that's why the son of man's got to be here right amen amen amen not Immortal flesh but in your flesh yes everybody all right say amen yeah Bible says God bless them verse 28 blessed means to be blessed or be adored to praise I love my children yeah yeah okay how bad they are awesome they're mine they came from me God's the same way he'll never ask you how long it took you to come to church he'll just say thank God I knew you were coming yeah he knows the days that you're going to make it so don't worry about that but then he keeps talking he said God said and then be fruitful wow now anything being fruitful means is to have a lot of children obviously you have that Revelation down here we're doing the same thing at our place you know we got some of the borderline people up here see what you started be fruitful the Bible says this is from the original and the Greek it says to show fruitfulness or to bear fruit amen be fruitful bear fruit in other words loud joy peace long suffering that's what we're that's actually the characteristics of God if we I have the characteristics of my father because I have the gene of my father inmate amen amen that's the mess up I have the gene of my natural father and me what we got to do is get the genome and then you know what we'll start acting like the rest of the family and the Bible says you have two sets to multiply that's another thing it says to become great not just to multiply in number but to become great God is bestowing all these blessings and you know what he hadn't put them in human flesh yet that's right amen that's right yeah yeah and he put him in human flesh in Genesis 1 26 this is a spirit man's gospel all right amen amen to lead to leave the animals the prophet of God said just like the Holy Spirit leads the people today and I believe that's what he was and amen amen but multiply become great the Bible says too he says to replenish fullness abundance what's he telling you to do multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it Adam had complete dominion over this Earth yes God in other words says look Adam I'll Take Care Of Heaven you take care of her I'm going to be the BG and you can't be the big Gene but you beat a little kid amen amen Adam gave me a little big G but he loves you because God told him to be a little bit right and when God spoke it it's got to happen amen amen what happened was is we got lost in the fall right and that Dominion are the title deed if you want to call it is that okay Adam lost the title Deeds right in other words Adam lost the family album that's right right yeah amen got it right it wasn't a title you want a title that you hand somebody says no God told Adam right here to multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion right so that's what God wanted Adam to do amen well when Adam lost that in the fall God said okay buddy son you can't do that anymore nothing can come through to you but death all right and that's all right nothing can come through you but there but I'm gonna come back amen I'm going to actually take that book in my bosom and I'm going to hide it amen I'm gonna take that book and I'm the father it's my book to start with amen amen amen I'm the head of the family I was just going to give my son responsibility to bring this in into being but you can't do it anymore son I'm gonna have to do it all right man because remember Adam got out and thought he could say good evening the prophet of God said he found out when he got out he couldn't get back in why he wanted to be a kid right yeah he was a little kid that's right there was no attribute in Adam to be a savior that's right Adam couldn't give his life for anything right amen right only God can do that so the VG had to come amen amen the seed of a woman God but is everybody okay because I can skip a lot of clothes if you can understand what this Genesis 126. it's a spirit man or brother round calls it a theophany right man which is God being able to be seen what God's doing he's condescending cutting down so that our finite mind can understand an infant of God Amen that's right see in our finite mind we don't know how many kids we're going to have but God is in for the Mind looked down two times last time I preached here on on uh foreknowledge God form you right then he could predestinate amen and that's what had to be foreign knowledge first and then he could look down through time see where all of his children would land and he'd just say okay that's what it's going to be but I'm gonna have to come and redeem that group of people amen because they can't save theirself right how many of us saved ourselves I didn't think so sir amen you can't save yourself amen amen but you know what the father can say to you amen father can come and do it he's not the power amen so he's a daddy he's the one that we came from amen everybody all right say amen amen all right so we can skip a few of these quotes here then that'll help us get along and it won't be three or four o'clock when we get finished let's read one questions in actions 1953 brother Louise you've been okay back there okay everything's fine I think he's good he can he can handle it he's a good addition to our church in other words we praise God he insisted Christine and the girl with his fit right in so great yeah God orchestrates this penis he puts it together questions asked for 1953 so now God created man his own image in his own likeness what kind of man did he create a spirit man now you'll notice after he made all the creation and created Spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question will find it that God gave Dominion of the cattle and fish and everything to the man but in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle to lead the beasts of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the Believers today amen now listen I do not believe when I thought said that we were back there with God we were in God in gene form we were not back there as Souls he said you were nothing all right you were laughing that makes you feel good but only in God Amen that's right God's Great mind he had us in his mind in gene form amen because the only way I can produce children is by my genetics all right amen they say I walk like my grandfather well mine doesn't fall like my grandfather because he doesn't have my grandfather's jeans in it but I have my grandfather's jeans the only way I can see this brothers and sisters is to look natural that's right amen so look at the natural the things we see in the natural that's right of being a father and being a son and having the attributes of my dad amen same thing when you get the new birth that brings the attribute so if you're a real God yeah the way we should imagine well the one that Adam and Eve was going to be able to produce amen amen but God so preserve this or the prophet of God said God took a picture of you hallelujah amen for the foundation of the world let's read that from 9964 questions and answers Steve but this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things comes right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you was 16 or 18. right yeah R20 that's your best when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great file our family album amen because only his kids are in his album right right amen and then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice amen amen but by for knowledge he knew what choice you would make so therefore predetermined amen amen amen because that looks like you're going down a straight line you can't do anything different no you still got a choice so you're still a free more agent even after you're born again you got free moral agency you can go by the Graver you can take a body chain you listen to the word of you that's right amen amen better choice today amen but the picture is the main thing then you become a servant of God him for knowing it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it now that picture is in God's Great Gallery up there we're preserved in God there's no way you can't make it if you're already in that album amen amen but it's because of what he saw you do when you got here listen even Cain could be saved yeah that's right the people in the nation don't believe that I do because it's a Bible amen the Bible says if you'll do as your brother that's exactly right you will be accepted sure God and you came wasn't going to do it right but he had to give him a choice that's right brother Matthew there's no way God can be just because he's the greatest judge that ever lived right but remember we can go to a court and a judge can do things wrong but you go to the court of God that's right he's already seen you do it amen amen he's already seen it happen amen that's right all right so he knows what's going to he knows how to judge and he could be a judge you can't come up to the white Throne judgment and God condemned this one and save this one if this one doesn't say Lord you never never he said yes I did they'll give you the date and the hour that he came to you to try to save your soul that's right and he'll stay there before you turn me down amen if not then he did choose one over the other and he can't do that not may have just thought he cannot do that amen so it is your choice amen I don't care who you think you are absolutely it's still your choice that's right brother Brown had a choice he had to be born again yes right amen a lot of the Prophet oh he's born in private but he hadn't been born again amen absolutely right brother you must be born again right if any Born Again puts you in this family that's right but remember now let's just look Adam lost the ability in the Garden of Eden but all wasn't lost the father takes the book yes he does and he holds on to that book Thank God but he presents that book in the Old Testament and types and shouting that's right amen that's right he comes down as Melchizedek what theophany amen amen amen that's something of God that's not the son of man that was the son of God that's right that's right amen amen gotta get a little slow here the Son of God is the creator that's the Son of God before the foundation of the world that's the creator of God amen amen amen amen that's the spirit God the Holy Ghost amen that's right amen right son of man is the one that was put in flesh right man it's not a man is God in human flesh right so the sun god in Revelation was even in the Old Testament in types and shadows but he did come down for one moment just to show the faith Seed of Abraham that in a final end we're gonna have to meet that same person just like Abraham about that man yes but that man couldn't say to Abraham yes amen it's good brother no Cassidy could not save Abraham that's right amen because it was a created body that's right now what happened in the fall proves that that created body couldn't save us yes it had to be born of a woman for a woman pollution came that's where it had to be cleaned as it came through amen but that was Melchizedek yeah that was God in human flesh sir for one moment meeting Abraham amen amen amen so and then what do you do you just step right back into eternity left that flesh just dust just go right back to the Earth man so that couldn't be your savior or Redeemer because remember Adam didn't felt didn't fall in his soul he fell in his excuse me fell in his flash right yeah the flesh is what had to be redeemed come on Amen listen the song God doesn't need Redemption that's right that's right he never sinned today hey let me give you one more thing here Genesis 1 26 man never sinned the day in his life this is 126 man that's right because remember the Holy Ghost came on the damn Pentecost but they didn't have enough Revelation yes to get this man changed amen right amen why well David took a Rapture if you didn't all right yeah amen Rapture right Praise You Lord the Raptor's here yeah man this is a Rapture because the revelation of the son of man God in human flesh has to be here Lord God Amen property of God see God in your flesh though that's right but in my flesh Amen brother praise God is that good that's good amen now it was one of my second most favorite scriptures let's go to Isaiah 53. amen 53. so let's look Adam lost the book that's right why you turning Adam lost the book of eternal life amen amen amen no one came Eternal lack Rider amen hello hey man any Old Testament they didn't even have the new birth they had an anointing of the Holy Ghost right right amen that's right a lot of information don't believe that I no Abraham's not a son of God show me in the Bible where he said the Bible calls him a friend of God right they had an anointing of the Holy Ghost goes around people the blood of bulls and goats couldn't get in that soul and say that okay the blood of wolves and goats can't save you it just pushes your sin to Calvary now when Calvary happened they go back and say Abraham your faith has saved you Isaiah Joseph all those ones in the Old Testament absolutely God in faith but in in the book of of Hebrews 11 it says they die not receiving the promise that's right what is the promise in your soul amen amen not an anointing the anointing to come on David and David could prophesy in the first person just like he was hanging on the cross that's right and when Adam million would come off from David you think David had the Holy Ghost in his soul no no the way the reason he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul swing had spring killed right that's right right and committed adultery right yeah probably go spilled person wouldn't do that that's right amen all right so God preserve that because remember Jesus the first sermon he preached was the Kingdom of Heaven is in hand yes amen and he said look he said the least in this kingdom is greater than John the Baptist praise God the least the weakest the weakest Born Again believer is greater than John the Baptist so they had an anointing on their flesh and God honored their faith but they are not the children of God in the Old Testament no they died in faith looking what even Paul Paul stands and looks in Hebrews 11 40 and he says they without us yes that's right they without us cannot be made white perfect amen I believe if you have the new birth today you're perfect amen so if they didn't have the new birth but when you come over to hear Paul says they without us cannot be made perfect amen all right Paul became obey him again you're laughing the rest over here because Paul said that that's right they without us when Paul died he became available because you walk over here today and you say they without us cannot be made perfect amen they can't come out of that great without you and I come into Perfection Hallelujah Isaiah 53 9 and he made his grave with the wicked right everybody don't like say amen amen we're doing pretty good bro Louise you're doing good you okay yeah okay I want everybody to see so I mean some people want everybody to see me I just want everybody to understand what the word says that's right it's great with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth praise God look at Isaiah 53 10. get it please the Lord and bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul his soul he said God's got a soul God is a soul amen God's only Soul there ever was that's right amen right Jesus said don't he said don't worry about the man who can grow up can't destroy the flesh right you should you worry about the mannequin destroy the soul God's Gonna welcome destroy us all that's right man all right God give you a soul he can take so away from it the look at this I love this when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his family yeah Hallelujah he had to go to Calgary and make an offering because you and I were bottomed up inside of that man yeah and I called Jesus Christ when he came he came here with us in him we didn't come here without him and us that's right amen yeah that's good brother amen amen all right say amen back there William you slipping amen all right Sam you doing okay yo about one son caught a shirt except for that pink tie it's not Coral that's pink gotta wake you up a little bit Gary please the Lord to prove him you have plenty of degree when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin when did he do that at Calvary right again the soul of God was in that man amen and that soul of God is where that seed comes from us right and man not my natural ones of a man you know I come by the spoken word of God amen amen that's why I always say Jesus hung there from six o'clock you know I mean from four o'clock three o'clock six o'clock yeah you know mine you get a call overnight you can't call over two of his name he was on the cross yeah I was always mine don't worry he wasn't dying for himself amen he didn't have to die that's right he was dying for me he was dying for him for his children because we were bottled up inside of that man called Jesus and there's no way for us to get out thank God thank you oh God unless he gave his soul an offering for sin yeah he shall see his seed praise God for his Gene his genetics his children he shall prolong his days in the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his wife Soul yes and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity thank God therefore Elijah divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil of the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death now listen God didn't die your soul don't die when you leave this world Amen that's right yes that's right amen amen amen right somebody said one time my God can't die but my God played the active part of that sure coaching again right here he says what shall pour out his soul unto death he played the part of death you can't kill God I can't kill brother Matthew like I said about Paul they chopped his head off right he was more alive than he was when he dropped his head off the soul inside of him was so much more real in them than the man that they take his head off like I said I didn't have to pick his head up that's right crazy man it's good bro you love more he poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bore the sin of many and made an intercession to the transgressive and we don't want to happen on Friday when Jesus was crucified prophet of God said God tore that soul out of that man well you know what the body died that's right that was our sacrifice that was the lamb that was the sacrifice the flesh was the sacrifice the flesh took the Strife God never took a Strife in his soul he took the stripes in his body for me and you his soul came out of the body but now remember one thing he wasn't finished Hallelujah that's right probably God said his work wasn't done that's right and I want to announce something to you today when he went to hell Caprice for those souls in prison I went with him that's right so you've already been to him you ain't got to go to hell no more you've already been there amen if you were in that theophany drive right yes Jesus when he went to hell you went with him and you don't have to go again because he's already paid prize his soul a ransom glory to God amen amen he'd have to pay dollars he paid it with his life he said my children now will be set free Satan you'll have any property you don't own anything you don't have the keys to your own house amen I'm going back up there and I'm going to come back 10 days later yes oh we love the resurrection I love it I love the resurrection but if he had to come back 10 days later in the hearts of them people that's right his job was not complete that's right but he did brother he 10 days later on today of Pentecost they were in that Upper Room sir Amen brother around and say God sent his soul back in the form of the Holy Ghost and filled those Believers with the Holy Ghost listen I've always said Satan if he would have left Jesus alone he would have only had to fight one Jesus so when he killed Jesus 10 days later that was 128. Amen in the next sermon then three thousand little Jesus said man he's having a fifth having a heart attack himself he's going what I killed one and I've already got 3120 Amen in one day Hallelujah compared to the church ages look at the millions of little Jesus is the same time to deal with he's bless his heart oh sure he's got his own thing that's right but it's not part of God yeah man get on the Lord amen man you gotta love him because he gave his soul of Ransom he actually sent his soul to hell yes he did for me and you that's right you know what we can't take ours down there so Satan says hey I got a little I got something I got to talk to you about but when God walks down there in Saint Lucie gone he's like hey man I really don't want you now yeah that's right that's right I don't want to talk to you anymore that's what I've always said you know Jesus in human flesh he's walking he looks at Legion and all those demons you know we I've always told the brothers in church I said look don't ever negotiate with the demon right when Jesus walks up to Legion the first thing they said to him was that's right Son of God why are you here amen I've always said the devil knew who God was but when he walked in front of the Pharisees the religious people today they said you're a devil all right right Pharisees is your devil Jesus and and Jesus walks out in front of a legion for the devils and they said you're the Son of God right what are you doing here before our time but you know what they felt that Spirit yes they did they felt that Spirit they knew that Spirit of Jesus Christ was more powerful than anything amen into the hearts of the blue now the son of God was the creator amen I still is I say was here's the Creator God Amen And that son of God moved into a a realm of Flesh Hebrews 10 5 a body down has prepared me right so the Son of God is in that flesh and that's called the son of man right yeah let's go back up just a little bit here with Jesus because that was he was the son of man right he wasn't a song man he was decent man yeah he was Big G in human flesh amen amen remember back he was BG he wasn't he had full control so he was Benji and human flesh so here's the son of man walking on the Earth showing and what happened in the parable in there in Matthew 13 is where remember he said a sword goes out to Soul he said who's the sower he said the son of man what's the seed the seed as to what children of the Kingdom you and I are the children of the kingdom and I am is that true say Amen are the children of what the family we're the family members amen so actually Jesus had to come here to show the word into the Earth because what are we feeding off of what are we living off of you and I'm a weak okay when we uh I don't like to say God the Holy Ghost but you get the Holy Ghost the other day you're alive and die and go to hell but Jesus you ever get party that's not good that's right but to handle the new birth amen that's gone in your soul yes God you burn out that old nature and put himself that's what come from the foundation of the world and it comes brother Randall says it vulcanize it yes that's right amen he vulcanizes you can't tell any difference because remember the prophet of God he said this is my eye God gave it to me amen because God give me the Holy Ghost it's mine now amen all right amen it's mine it's my possession it's what I had before the foundation of the world he loved if I was able to come the way we were supposed to come but we weren't we weren't and you don't want to go I didn't have a heart attack no this is the way it was supposed to be all right man don't worry about it Jesus came but I want to read you a quote that a lot of people want just it stumps people let me read it right here in this option 1960. brother Brown says inheritance by predestination I inherited something yes what inheritance question mark there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me in an area that's right Jesus never left you an inheritance right think about what I've been talking about Amen brother Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only come down and paid for your inheritance amen aren't you to your inheritance I am the way the truth in your life amen Christ but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world amen amen God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first amen there's the book The Inheritance was first God saw yes and he put that in a book and preserve it doesn't matter what anybody does you can't destroy that image when God said blessing man let us wait man that image will never be the same amen you kill this all you want to but the real image of me will never be destroyed amen amen when Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left you an inheritance right he came to pay yeah it gets you back to your inheritance he only come down and pay for your inheritance remember he gave his soul a ransom a ransom is if I take this Brethren I put him in a in a in a cell and I say look I want some money Ransom money yes I want some Ransom money for this brother well that's what God did remember the brother promise said Satan put us in a pawn shop right right amen that's right man now Jesus didn't bring us that eternal life we already had it the reason he came was we already had amen amen he just came to open the door right Amen to get us out of the pawn shop that's right man thank you Lord God give me your inheritance your inheritance was first saying exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved and He sent Jesus to save those he already told hallelujah amen amen hallelujah I love that but listen to this this is this is even better in Revelation chapter five churches book we still believe you read interpreting amen thank you it's not a woman's book or leave the hell's book right I don't mind saying stuff like that I'm sorry I think it's stupid yeah go ahead man Amen brother Brandon proofread that book that's right so you know what that's right that's good enough for me I hate all these you're not supposed to hate when God hate sin right yeah so if God's in me I hate sin all right amen okay I hate saying I hate these people they say well this is that and this and that and this wasn't this God approved all of it bro this is God proved it all right I'm saying a prophet stands before no one except God himself amen amen so if you if you supersede that and put yourself and say that you can correct the prophet them right you look what you've just done yeah that's the Antichrist man that's one that wants to be closer to God that's exactly man you have super seated that and come around and say oh brother Brown's wrong or didn't he Jesus Christ 1961 brother rammsteady breaks the seal reveals gives us gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited yes amen amen becoming kinsman redeemer because remember he did inherit flesh right amen amen amen amen and freely gives it out to us it all belongs to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people oh what a great father yeah thank you Jesus what a horrible father even the Bible says that if a son asks for a fish and you give him a stone right right oh no we got a father that he knew what we wanted before we wanted it already there before we need it everybody all right say amen amen but here we look excuse me the apostles and we see we go back to our scripture in Matthew where the son of man be risen again because we know that some man died two thousand years ago and that's what the world is celebrating the resurrection of that man right man but somewhere he got buried again yeah yes if if brother Bradham indicted the generation for the crucifixion of Christ they killed him again brother Ryan said put into an open shame so obviously if they killed him they had to bury him right that's why Jesus said the son of man had to be risen again from the dead and Elijah had to come and restore all things so we're sitting right in the middle of this of this resurrection of the son of man amen amen amen the Risen again but what is it it's the family members of God that's right it's not the devil's kids listen it this wasn't for Luther I'm sorry but I'm going to make a statement Luther couldn't preach this message today amen that's true Right Wesley didn't preach this message like I'm preaching by the way even Peter when Jesus looked at Peter and I know this may be controversial but you know what I'm controversial I just don't like to be normal I'm not normal okay but Jesus asked Peter a question said who your man say I the son of man am right Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God that's right right Peter only had a son of God in Revelation he did not answer that question the way Jesus presented it to him right because the son of man Revelation was hid until 2000 years later in this end time do you hear what I'm saying do you understand amen Peter said Thou Art of Christ the son of the Living God he didn't say the word for some land he didn't say thou regarding human Collective men prophesied the son of man Revelation though was was preserved for this time right here when Jesus died and resurrected and when he ascended he sent back that son of God's revelation amen amen because if anybody would have ever got the son of man Revelation there is the body chain my mind there is what you and I are living for today that's right amen you and I are not here to go by Wesley's message or Luther's message or Pentecostal message or even even Paul Irene is they had their heart right I am not and not belittling the Apostle Paul right but Paul was a great Revelation he had if he would have got the son of man Revelation they either took a Rapture in the first church but God held back amen because he listen he can't go over his word because he said the son of man was risen again from the dead and then he went right straight to a lies truly shall come first never short all things right yes Elijah the ministry the forthcoming obliga had to come and restore all things before that son of man in Revelation could be made on the face of this earth right amen right look what we got amen sure Son of God of Revelation was held the people down through the church ages but they died they're in a grave they're waiting on us they're waiting on somebody to receive a revelation that the son of man's not coming right brother he's him amen that's right thank you Lord now the physical body of Jesus Christ will not come here until the Millennium that's right Brothers but it's a strong man had to be risen again from the dead there's got to be a son man of Revelation you and I like this I just read that quote to you brother I don't say God in human flesh in you that's right amen that's right run around look in Oneness now buddy if you want to read a book one this is good book three amen 1962 brother Ryan said now don't you see the great picture okay we and flesh are different we're like a byproduct a creative being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen not some other spirit but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit listen what about what about God listen listen to me just saying what about God here's the great God the Eternal God he can speak things into existence he can speak things out of existence he created everything amen but yet because of the bar of the word he can't be here with his family like he wants to be right because of what sin this thing's exactly right that's the bar or the enmity The Amity was a division between God and man God had to pull away from him because God can't stand right amen amen now he looks at your soul every day and says that that's my children they're Eternal right but we still got to deal with this this is what we got to deal with right here man amen look not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined in wedlock to the eternal see how God planned that we should be not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real Union and offspring of the almighty amen done by holy Union in other words not by the ones of your parents but by the Spoken Word season right before the foundation of the world that we should have come by the spoken word of God Amen I believe through Adam and Eve it takes two three weeks there of management and all my ministering there was was uh maturity you know right God's not going to come back for a baby bride right right so he's not coming back for a bunch of baby rhymes that's right it's always coming back for a while you're a grown woman amen somebody who knows what to do with the word of God Amen so we're joined in wedlock to the Eternal yes see how God planted that we should not be different but him not some other being or some other tribe but a real Union and offspring of the almighty yes done by holy Union holy yeah the body comes from mother and father but the spirit comes from God God is separating himself as Adam was separated then watch it's a continuation paragraph 21. on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating himself and setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together what a master builder well if he's a master builder and he built this we shouldn't be a masterpiece family that's right amen amen God putting himself together then with that group of people together what does it do brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together yes and today in this great separation that we're living in denominational differences and things what a Pity what a disgrace and I say the same thing about this message sure that's right amen right that's what I'm telling you people if you don't have the essence of this message this will kill you where do you think they get there where do you think they get their quotes and when Anthony come on brother they get their documents from what the brother Ryan what brother random said right amen but if you don't get the very essence of what he was saying Essence is what the variable if you smell something it's the essence you get the essence not exactly what's written on a paper Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood are we supposed to all be vampires right no we're supposed to get in Revelation of what he was talking about man same thing with brother random amen there were things he said to confuse the wise and prove it yes amen amen amen amen amen but reveal them to white babies Amen in other words his family how do you think a father is not going to give his family or his children something wrong that's right so he's going to bring you you number one you got to see that you're in the family that's right number two you guys see that your daddy's talking to you amen you ain't got to see all the things that you get the responsibilities of the family yeah cut your back but look paragraph 23. joined in handling wedlock to the Eternal God part of him part of God and flesh I became Brandon because of my father around him you become part of your father and mother but in spirit we become in Union with God we are a part of God thank you Lord amen that's what Dave Genesis 1 26 man was a part of God yeah he's not a Shepherd identity from God thank you Lord amen and it was God made manifest in another form amen called The Bride or his family members amen spoken words Regional

Headstone yes we'll be the Super Church a super race as they near the headstones they will be much like him so much like him even will be in his very image yes and in order to be United with him they will be one amen they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God you still believe in what the prophet says amen amen 1963 paragraph 146. when I think of it I just see denominations pass off the scene and everything else just goes see when I see God's Great purpose revealing himself yeah and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead body and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into the people yeah right amen that he could have the preeminence is the oversight and the leading amen amen amen the complete fullness of the godhead Bible

years yeah yeah waiting for us to come to a place but he gets down in the church ages and he gets down don't move he gets down he rubs that image my Lord amen amen amen oh you did your job amen Irene yes you did you go hey look if somebody would have walked in the room because it all started with just a square piece of concrete is that right exactly it started with a square piece of ground and and to to the untrained eyes that look at it and said it's just a rock yeah right right but that image was always amen yes sir that's it and break off the big chunks right and now he's got down to the little chunks right beautiful and he's getting into defense praise God her brother Matthew he's got so close to his work he hadn't really seen it hey man sir beautiful brother he steps back and he goes thank me that's my son amen that's my family that's right he goes just like your daddy he said now speak amen amen I'm finished talking about you you speak for your family amen all right amen this is not a one-man show hallelujah oh man you can't speak your body changes you're gonna have to see this during the very end and then God has given you the ability to speak he took that sword in the word and he looked back and he said he said Adam you speak right yeah you call whatever that is amen bro you call back if you don't want that trail whatever you move it I'm not gonna lose it amen he's come down to the end time right and he's made us so free amen he has given us freedom and liberty in this word of God to say that you and I yeah yes are the final boys under our messenger messenger's gone but the message lives on brother Graham said Rapture and faith lies in these books he didn't say home he said in yeah own these books and tapes is where we get all these false doctrines right yeah but if you get in these books amen that's where you get the essence of the true relationship speak the word of God yeah start speaking amen he said what if you don't work what if he does man remember if we have the mind of God you won't speak anything anything out of water if this guy's doing the speaking remember why didn't he tell him he said look take no fall right amen take off off the day when you walk up I'm the daddy here I'm running control and I'm the one that's going to take over but you know what I'm not going to be down here to do it I'm gonna do it through you that's the way till I chose it and that's the way I believe it yeah we love you with all my heart we love you people I hope the day they see the Lord before the foundation of the world you had a plan and that plan was not for you to be here on Earth to finish this up in human flesh amen yes Lord but your plan was to be in your children amen and them being in human flesh yeah thank God that son of man Ministry being made alive risen again coming out of those Creeds and denominations you brought us a prophet Lord that can go up so high he could look at all different directions the Lord not only him but he brought a bride up to that level and where even the apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists were given for the perfecting of the Saints you could raise up into that atmosphere Lord and see into eternity and absolutely see what the prophet saw Lord amen amen not that we're prophets but you told us we were a little Messiah Hallelujah you told us that we were little gods and you're God it's a little Gina amen father I pray that now we take control yes Father not only we're not ever going to take control of this world but we're going to take control of this flesh this world if we walk in first yes Lord and then father after that we will have complete Dominion he said in Revelations 5 will be Kings and Priests and we'll Reign on this Earth father after redemption's over but it's not over yet amen yes it's not over yet life anymore there's still some that needs to come in yes there's still some of us that needs to come to a maturity Lord where you can praise God you can trust what we speak because the prophet of God's saying there that power without character is satanic yes Lord we have the power amen I pray God that you give us the character you'll be able to use the word of God yes in the Eternal way that you wanted to end you say Eternal absolutely the word of God is eternal and if we become the word of God then absolutely we'll be coming in the same life I praise you and bless each one Lord is here bless the pastor the ones that are assembled here Lord the ones that are they're visiting just be with them right here with Jesus we know you're here amen because we brought you here with us but now I pray Lord that we was without limitations that we freely let you work yes you'd have the preeminence that the fullness of the godhead father who would be in The Bride of Jesus Christ and that you truly can look at us and say I'm proud that they're my children what a proud papa to look down on his children and say that's they're acting just like they're dead but thank you Lord for all things we ask you blessings Jesus name is he ah yes holy holy I will bless his name again hear it no one else foreign God's gave us a commission yes God give us commission to grow up amen and where we don't end our brain we use the what the mind of God that's right amen and forgetting the word puts you in the mind of God that's right something else you get in the word of God and then what you can do is it's like I told him many times before I don't know anything about electricity and I hate to be shocked awesome so I am fearful of even that light socket over there I I don't I wouldn't even take the cover off that why I'm not skilled in what to do with electricity but now a master electrician that does it every day that's nothing to him right he opens that up does his work don't even have to cut power off right he scare me to death why because I'm not trained in what I'm doing same way with God God can't use you and you're going to be scared to use a word of God unless you're trained in the word of God right so how you do that brother I've said read your Bible and practice that's right that's it that's real hard and it is yeah it's real hard yeah so read your Bible and pray and get closer to God that's right stay in the message of the hours amen amen when you come up to something speak the word of God yes speak the word of God Don't Be Afraid amen a lot of Heavens don't be impressive daddy gotta eat something yeah you know what he's going to say speak all right yes the master builder does not make mistakes you're not a mistake being here so just take that sword of God go forward speak the word of God and watch God back it up he'll have to the only way to get that dead those dead things on the ground is for us to be able to speak to where God lives and not speak it frivolously not speaking on our own mind but we are in the mind of God and speak what he says then they're going to come out of the ground yeah there's nothing to hold them back that's right the resurrection is the next thing that's yeah because we don't get our body changed till after the resurrection Yeah man so the resurrection that's next that's right that's the next thing we're looking at is the resurrection of the Dead God bless amen praise God I appreciate that word today amen hard not to you know carry it on a little bit after all that good work amen we appreciate that you heard something so mildly important today my brothers and sisters I believe we heard the express stop to Jehovah and then God stops Express amen through the truth that he's brought to his children these last days Amen brother sisters we can't make ourselves into that image but his word and his Spirit has the power to transform us into that image amen I appreciate that ministering today it's just like this Bible where the Timothy is a mirror and sometimes when you go on in around your day-to-day life that devil he tries to huff and puff all that hot air and put that that moisture up on your mirror and try to fog it up so when you look down at your mirror it don't look too good then you can't see your reflection in the mirror like you need to let God sends somebody like a precious brother like brother Wade or a minister brother in spite of the spirit to bring that word he brings a nice soft cloth and wipes that nasty devil humidity off that mirror lets you see a little better and then I agree I see myself today erase God Amen as that Ministry was going forth but otherwise I see myself on Calvary I see myself in hell I see myself in the book right I see myself descending Out of Heaven I see my son believe that in time testimony of Jesus Christ and that's what brother Minister do you have to see yourself and the Plan of Redemption amen amen does anybody any specific prayer about anything before we go today anything at all that we can stand in agreement with you about well let me ask my sister-in-law foreign how many would say to us today that you want more and more in your life to seize your true identity in Christ if you want to make it more clearer you let the Holy Ghost make it more up here amen the heavenly father sees those hands amen amen amen well I'm gonna uh just take a few minutes and ask the Lord for His blessings and I'd like for a little brother David our Guatemalan brother to come out

you're going to have his same characteristics you're going to have it the same way he acts as in the physical father if you're child of your father you're gonna have to act the same way as your
