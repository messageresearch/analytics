Lord just settle our weary Soul father of all the different things that Lord we having to to worry with in life Lord and just for a few minutes just for a few minutes as the priest would take the blood back into the holy of holies and and when that curtain would drop it'd be dead silent it would just be you and the priest well father I pray that today Lord we drop the curtain behind us of the world and the things and the thoughts and the ideas and the and the um things that we have to do in our job and just for a few moments Lord let's let us listen to you father we ask you to be ones that are sick be the ones that are not with us Lord we pray for sister fra and the different ones Lord the ones that are going for test um Dad's going for test I think Monday or so and then my test is going to be on the 25th of August I pray Lord that you would just be with the hand of the surgeon and different things and and the technicians and we pray that you everything would be just fine for your honor and Glory just bless us now Lord and further in this service in Jesus name we pray amen the Bible says in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth I know y'all can't see that sorry about that I missed the step y'all can goad and be seated sorry about that thinking about other stuff and but what you just hang on a minute technology technology okay look all right now that better okay h John 3:3 say Jesus answered and said that's kind of what we're going to speak on tonight is the new birth because it is one of the most ill taught subjects I believe if you took and and and maybe went to a a restaurant and and just walked up to a table and says are you a Christian if they say yes say well what do you what how do you get how did you get saved you'll get a lot of different ideas and opinions and and you'll get a lot of well I did this and I did that and I started going to church or I cried or I or I shook a pastor's hand and I I move my letter into the Baptist Church and I did this in the Methodist Church and I was baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost and you also get all these different ideas but there's got to be one truth when Jesus said verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again one one birth all right now remember your first birth is your problem all right and without the second birth your first birth is going to be your problem still all right but after you get born here to be a flesh person and we'll talk about that in a minute Jesus tells Nicodemus except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God and that's our problem maybe in the message I I just happened to uh I I don't think I'll ever do that again but I got on YouTube and to believe the sign people were on and I kind of clicked on it don't even waste your time don't even waste your time amen I mean unless you unless you believe whatever sign they believe I change my name if I believe the sign I don't know what kind of sign they believe in but I know one thing's for sure they really are ridiculing brother brandham and call him all kind of faults and a liar and all these different things so and they're trying to save people from the the message well thank God he saved me from that am man thank God he saved me from that and gave me an understanding I mean they're playing clips of brother Donnie and different ones and brother Tim pu and all you know saying what they say about the the whole thing but I just want to ask him one thing if brother Brandon was not the messenger of Malachi 4 God's got to send us one cuz he said in the Bible he had to send us one before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord they can't take out Malachi 4 they say stay with the Bible well let's stay with the Bible Malachi 4 says God going to send us a prophet that would turn us around from where we were well if he don't send them then God's a liar right but God's already sent him we know that but I they must be looking for something else but what they need is is they need for Jesus to say very verely I say unto you except you be born of water and spirit you cannot enter the kingdom of God or in other words you can't understand the kingdom of God and and and and what gets me is is is the whole time the the the brother was talking he was talking about the Holy Spirit told me this and the Holy Spirit told me that his holy spirit's got to be different from mine cuz it ain't telling me the same thing it was telling him one of us is wrong all right but I'll I'll hang my soul on what I'm seeing here all right I I'm I'm sold out but just don't even worry about that believe the sign Bunch let me just put it this way their Folly are hours will be made manifest so don't worry when we come to the end of the road one of us is going to be false and the other one is going to be true all right so I'm not going to sit here and and and preach sermon after sermon of why brother brand we think he was a prophet if you don't know that by now then you're going to be deceived you really are going to be deceived all right cuz remember it would almost deceive the very elect the Bible says if it were possible it would get so close to where it would confuse her and that's what's happening now there's a lot of confusion in the message number one about the New Birth they say some say that it's this and some say even in the message that it's that and some say that you that you just realize and it's kind of like a light switch you know you you always had the power you just turn the light switch on and you start believe in the message well that's I don't believe that I'll tell you where brother B talks about that here in just a minute and I really appreciate this one quote that that God gave me uh yesterday to put in here and Marvel not that I said unto you now look he told Nicodemus Nicodemus is probably going he said Marvel not Nicodemus you know the whole disertation was is you're the teacher you're the number one guy uh and even Nicodemus said we know you're a teacher sent from God well then when he tells then when the teacher that sent from God tells him Nicodemus what to do it's kind of like us Lord what can we do what can we do well do the a b and c and you don't do one of them and you wonder why God didn't do something for you well do ABC always believe Christ but Marvel not that I say unto you you must be born again brother R says and you must be born again says God bless his word now I want to take the subject this morning of Jesus's first Doctrine the first doctrine of Jesus was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine he's talking about Sunday school and he says look I have thought in my heart that this is something that seems puzzling to the people we hear so much about it all the time I thought it would be good this morning if we could search the subject clear it out and that's the first beginning you must be born again and it's the very deep one we find out that there's so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say You must be born again but each one has their different interpretation to that what it means to be born again and and you know you youd say well I know I'm born again because of XYZ I know I'm born again and everybody's got their place to put that you know I was born again because all right but we know according to what we see in this church that we know that we have to go through justification we have to go through sanctification and then we go to the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is an inward filling it's not an anointing and we got to know the difference right all right because the anointing can look and feel like the true Holy Ghost and can be the true Holy Ghost that's right but you can be deceived in your soul and not let him in ain't that what anointing ones is brother Brown said you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day in your life on your spirit on your second realm and die and go to hell because your soul and and we'll read it here just a minute that's that same group that comes up and says have I not have I not have I not have I not have I not cast out Devils have I not preached your message have I not done this have I not done that and he says depart from me I never knew you in other words never had an intimate relationship with you now brother R said look there must be and is a truth somewhere so now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again it says You must be born again not you ought to you must be born again now watch no matter how much that we try to think we're right in saying a Creed or joining a church or saying we always was eternal you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God so what changes you the actual New Birth is what changes you all right it doesn't change you what's he saying it doesn't I didn't he didn't say the new birth he's saying all that Creed and stuff that don't change you your Creed joining Church change your idea or your good intentions although as good as may seem it's still not right there's something got to happen the new birth is an experience all right every one of you sisters that have had children like I said Sunday you were there when it happened and and unless you were just not silly you knew what was going on when it was going on when the birth was happening all right so it was an experience it was something you went through water blood and spirit just like the new birth water blood and spirit so the new birth is an experience something that takes place so it is not that that brings the new birth which is what the Creeds that's not what brings in you birth a different churches say well you accept this or believe that that's it's all right but it isn't and that's what people doubt they if you believe the message you got to be born again no the devil believes it more than you do cuz he studies it more than you do then people that believe the sign I believe they study the message more than we do they have their little quotes and little things and all those stuff they say brother R this brother r that they can study all they want to now to begin with to base back the reason we have to be born again because the Bible teaches us that we were all born in sin shapen in iniquity and come to this world acute little liar then that shows us that our nature to begin with is sinful to start with we're no good to begin with so we cannot claim anything by our shrewdness that's why I said we if we boast that we're in the message and and we were always was this eternal group and we always this and always that where's this where's this our nature is sinful to begin with all right and God will not dwell in an unclean vessel so there's not God in there and the devil there at the same time it's one or the other not both all right everybody with me all right so we cannot claim anything by our shess our sincerity how great we are how little we are or whatever more we're all together wrong to begin with boy that puts us all on a Level Playing Field brother George it just makes no big eyes no little use everybody's the same you all got to be born again to be the bride thereby with me to be the bride you have to be born of the spirit of God the old nature burned out the new nature put in a new creature a new creation in Christ Jesus we are all together wrong to begin with and there is nothing that can do about it you had nothing to do to get you here but now when you got here and you come to the age of accountability you then have something to do with it all right so we come here and we see that Joel two says it shall come to pass that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters are prophesy and your old men will dream dreams young men will see visions and you know what this is doing this is this is broadening uh the brush that God has has the the stroke that God has give to the world he's give everybody a chance he threw it out there now listen we do we do preach an exclusive gospel all right hang on we do CU God said separate yes sir all right God said separate yourself that was what Israel's problem they didn't separate theirself but God says you separate yourself and then when he got sent us a prophet thank God one day he told brother brandom and through prophecy he said now I call you bride well see that separated us from the church cuz the church is going to go through the tribulation but the bride will not go through the tribulation why cuz the bride is Born Again of the spirit of God in their soul and they're a new creation a new creature but he's still going to pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh there people are going to going to receive the Holy Ghost as an anointing y foolish virgin will will keep that on them for a period of time but I read it to you in a minute where brother Brandman comes says it comes down to one thing that's the word it comes down to the word it's nothing else but the word of God being preached in its truth and in its entirety yes all right cuz listen listen the Baptists have truth but they don't have truth in its entirety the methodists have truth but they don't have truth in his entirety and if you don't grow up in God and you're just still a little baby with the Holy Ghost and you're still having uh um diaper issues or feeding issues or eating issues there's something wrong with you you got to grow up you're supposed to grow up God wants us to grow up listen he requires that we grow up that's right all right if he requires we grow up though he has to give us the simplest way to do that and ever we make it hard he doesn't we make it hard to grow Hebrews 9:6 now when these things were thus ordained it's talking about the priest going back into the Tabernacle now watch but into the second went the high priest alone so he went into the holy of holies with the blood which he offered for himself and for the people verse 8 says and the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as yet the first Tabernacle was yet standing in other words while the law was in effect there was no new birth right and and and that's a revelation that a lot of people in the message don't have that there was no new birth until the day of Pentecost now there was fings there was anointings there was things that came on John the Baptist got the Holy Ghost but he didn't get the new birse I mean the Bible even tells us in the Book of John it says the Holy Ghost was not get given because Jesus had not been glorified in other words he not died yet he had to die to release that life that's why he was that's why Nicodemus really couldn't understand cuz there stood Jesus with every bit of that inside of him and that Shield of flesh is what shielded him from the priest knowing who he was right you a man making yourself God no it was God making himself a man but they couldn't understand that so while the first Tabernacle was standing there was an ordinance that a priest went behind the veil with the blood for every person in Israel and those who accepted it were free for another year but remember it didn't make the come or there un perfect it only pushed his sin to the next year I know it's Elementary but we got to get to somewhere and there's a lot of young people here that need to know that they need to be born again all right we're going to have a lot of problems but if you'll get born again I'll promise you it'll help you get through them so see that's what gives me a a confidence because in the Old Testament if you were a child and you went to school you had to go to a high priest or you had to depend on a high priest to go sacrifice something for you but now now you have something to do with it children you come to the throne of grace you come up here bowling as we did Sunday and we prayed the prayer of faith that everybody was going to be covered everybody was going to be that going to get the best grades this year I believe than they ever got before if they'll just let the Lord do it okay I believe that so in the Old Testament is always a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect so pertaining to the conscience and then we continue on but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building what was it he's talking about his body neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place where Calvary he went to Calvary and then he died and they put him in a tomb and he when he come out of that tomb that was a perfect Tabernacle that's exactly I come from God I go to God all power in heaven and Earth's been given unto me he come to a position listen he didn't say that any time during his life he could steal the water he could steal the storm he could make water into wine he could do a lot of those things but he never stood and said all power in heaven and Earth's been given unto me cuz he had to die first he had to die to release that life so that we can have have a savior that died amen a God that died for me and resurrected and then was able to not just go somewhere and sit down under a tree and say okay I got it and you're not getting any no he died for me and you that's why I love brother B he said never forget Calvary I don't care if you can preach the seals the plagues the vials Daniel 70 weeks which we have and covered over and over but if you ever forget where you came from if you ever forget Calvary you're in trouble you forgot it the first place you need to go back all right neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained look he obtained Eternal Redemption for us remember the quote that always stumbles people in adoption series he brother Brown said Jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance your inheritance was before the foundation of the world it was Genesis 1:26 that was your inheritance he brought you a way back to get to that inheritance cuz remember he said your inheritance was first it was barred there was no way it could happen anymore that Genesis 126 and 27 man was bottled up in Jesus Christ and there was no way to get out until the testator died all right because the remember of The Testament is not in force we'll read it right here and for this cause he is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were under of the first testament which are called they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance all right I like Eternal inheritance there's inheritances that come down here on the earth that's very temporal even gifts are temporal amen for what a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it has no strength it has no strength while the man standing there but when that man dies and goes away but the promise for him to come back it wasn't that the lamb died and you never saw the lamb anymore because that lamb soul never or Spirit never could come back on you into you and change you make you different that's why Moses and all the different ones had power they had an anointing without the Holy Ghost without the character of the Holy Ghost and they did what they did and as brother Bob was talking about Sunday and and many many times we've went through this but there was a promise given in Genesis 3:15 he said I'll put iny in other words he said you're going to have children you're going to be sorrowful you're going to have to live under your husband talking about the wife you're going to bring children in sorrow and man you're going to have to dig the ground by the sweat of your brow and from ashes you came from or dust you came from from dust you going back if he'd have left it at that we had no hope but he didn't he said but I will put enmity I'll put enmity between the seed of the woman and your seed in other words I'm coming back as the seed of the woman that's the promise I'm going to bring you even the promise of Joel that I pour out my spirit on All Flesh was not that he was going to put the Holy Ghost in every person but it was available for every person to have if they wanted it amen all right everybody with me on that all right that wasn't the promise there was a promise everybody was going to get an opportunity but the promise was not that every person that just breathes a breath of life is going to get the Holy Ghost amen so there is a special group of people there is a special group of people that's going to get the new birth look God God having provided some better thing for us now wait a minute he provided some pretty good stuff in that Old Testament he provided all these different prophets to prophesy and do Great Mighty wonders and part a sea and and and live in a whale and do all these different things and and come out on the end of a flood that's pretty powerful but God said he provided something better for me and you which was what that we could walk around on this Earth with the Holy Ghost in our soul and be moved and directed by that Holy Ghost not just an anointing come on us and then we're just uh you know rank center after that no God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so somewhere they are not complete whatever you want to think that's your business I'm just going to tell you I don't think they got a glorified body because to me that's the epitome that's the Apex when we come to The Headstone and we are changed in the moment in the twink of I we have reached that full promise and we're bringing a whole group with us we're bringing ages with us ages of people that have waited the prophets even Jesus stood and he said all these prophets they yearned to see this day and they didn't but you're looking at it well guess what is Jesus Christ not back again then you're looking at it you're looking at the day he talked about the day of the Lord amen then acts 238 tells us number one you got to do is repent and then be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise what the promise of the Holy Ghost in your soul is it to you to your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and he's still calling he's still calling he's still calling people to repentance to give them that promise all right cuz somebody's going to be Kings and Priests cuz that's what the Bible said all right Blasphemous names brother Brown said look now I believe that the reason there's so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit is not correctly taught I believe if the baptism is taught just say the baptism well see that would be just like said automobile you know but there's plenty of them there's a lot of different ones there's different parts that go in that automobile all right same thing and they work different but the Holy Ghost said look now when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that so it's not just God dumping on you it's you got to go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know and sanctification and we'll get to it in a minute you know we talk about the unclean Spirit going out we talk about uh I didn't find that quote but I need to find it where brother Brown says says that your name goes on the book of sanctification as a Believer all right so you start cuz in justification what are you doing you're be Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and he saves you and that's about it that's just it you're you're at a place where God you forgive me but I'm still wandering around here because remember that same Spirit hadn't even left the house yet in Luke it's left the house in sanctification in justification it's still there tormenting you every day that's the tough that's a tough part to get over all right but if you'll let God do it it'll be an easy part and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that huh see there's a lot goes with that and here is what I think that God is proving is that the holy spirit is here that's what I said we we've got to come to a conclusion somewhere that the Holy Ghost inside of me and you are is right that's right and everything else is wrong see because they're coming to the conclusion on the believe of people that the Holy Ghost is in them and that's what's correct and everybody else is wrong well there's got to be something somewhere as brother rown said there's got to be an absolute so if if if we need to look for another absolute please Lord we've wasted 60s something years by listening to tapes and books and and and preaching this message if you if if it's what they say that brother Brown was a liar and you don't you know I mean come on how could a man stand that had been to Hell twice he stands one day and he says I'll be held accountable if I'm lying to you I mean how could a man stand there that you can't deny that's what I want to tell them one day I really don't somebody's tried to you know talk to them but there's really no sense in trying to talk to them only God can help them but but you see there had to be something Supernatural in brother R's life he couldn't go through 50 something years and keep all this line up and and and be able to look in another dimension and go into and tell the truth at least they listen at least he did tell the truth when he was in another dimension when when he was talking to somebody and said you're from so and so and you they can't deny that they can't right so he has been in another region that me and you have not been in and they have not been in he was in a place and he saw death he saw hell he saw those hideous things why in the world would he standing in the pull pit knowing that's where he's going if he's trying to lie to people I I just don't get it so let's continue on everybody all right brother R said things that are to be he said now the only way that you can be a son and daughter of God now look you have to have eternal life now here's a quote I want to bring you this one then I'll bring you another one because some read this in the message that you come here with eternal life now that's a belief now brother Bob he knows for a fact I've sat and talked to him so is he so it's not a it's not hearsay they literally believe that you came here with some kind of form seed spot dot of eternal life in your soul somewhere right brother Aaron has two we've all we've all met them because it's prevalent in the message cuz they take these quotes and they twist them around but I want you to listen to this now the only way that you can be now watch why didn't he say well you already a son and daughter of God he starts out right here telling you that the only way you can be a son and daughter of God because you have to you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always not a doubt that Genesis 126 man did not develop over time it was any eternity with God but it was in the mind of God it was not a little seed running around in his loins like we do as men to have children everybody with me on that it's not a little dot or a little spot it's by predestination by him seeing by forn knowledge that you would come here and want it and he had it for you now look watch to be a Son of God you had to be in him always in him not him in you praise God we wouldn't need salvation if he was always in us if we came here with us and him he did but we didn't come here with him and us we come here with a potential we come here with with um as brother R said the woman at the well she had representation that's right in other words when God stood out there in Genesis 1:26 and he let us make man our own image there was a group of people that was that was formulated in his mind called your name and my name there was no place that it began though if you had a beginning in that part you are dead amen CU Adolf Hitler had a part in that he was in the thoughts of God but not the Eternal section that Genesis 26 man is the Eternal section of the book of life right it's not just the Book of Life not the whole book it's a section of the book now watch the gene of your life now watch the gene of your life that you're sitting in today came from your parents y'all can say Amen anytime you want to okay the gene of your life that I'm looking at came from an act between your father and your mother that was was this released and that came down and right and then God give you a soul right and as we read the quote before you were born lost you were born in a way that God never intended for you to be born right born in sin shap in iniquity I read all that but now look the gene of your life comma spiritual life now we move it over it's not what Mom and Daddy brought it's not that genetics that God's that brother R's talking about now watch the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God so he separated it himself from the genetics you have now to the gene seed that you were before the foundation of the world everybody with me okay I want you to get this because you will hear this I'll probably hear it this weekend sadly the gene of your life your spiritual life now that's your spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule now listen your stinking body was not there's a separation he's talking about the gene seed of your Eternal part that was in the mind of God the Genesis 126 man all right was in God the Father before there was even a molecule see look and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene life that was in God as a Son of God now look and you're expressed look after after his word come in you now if you always had it when was there in after huh we believe brother Brown was a prophet right we believe all the quotes every one of them we got to take them all they you know you can take certain over here and make your Doctrine correct but you got to take every one of them that's what I've always liked about brother Dale he would take every quote that seemed contrary and every quote that was that was uh we believe in this but now I don't know about this but he'd take both of them put them right together that's right right that's what we told him at the meeting one time you know about Daniel 70 weeks we said look we can take both all these quotes and put them together you have to totally deny this whole book over here to make your Doctrine right am most of yall some of y'all were there you have to deny these quotes I how can you deny quote amen that's right that's like denying the Bible am look you are expressing no I'm sorry after his word has come in you to to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you now listen you were not expressing God's life when you were a sinner I'm not even going to ask you did you I'm going to tell you you didn't but there was representation in God not in you right you are expressing God's life in you now look he's saying now after the words come in you you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son and daughter of God therefore you get what I mean congregation says amen I doubt that a lot of them teach what they teach you are and now look you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate watch wherever you are God knew by for knowledge God knew that you would be here right because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes okay everybody with me you had to be what if you were there watch if you ever if you've got eternal life he wasn't talking to the sinner he was talking to people that were born again if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life well sure you had a natural life that was dying but you had a soul inside of you that was yearning for God and when God Bur burn that old nature out he put what he put that Genesis 126 eternal life inside of you to me that makes it so simple and that is the Plan of Salvation I was lost now I'm found there is no Plan of Salvation if he always was eternal and all of a sudden you just figured out who you are that takes away justification takes away sanctification see what I mean but it's very prevalent so be careful I just listen I just I don't deny that I was lost right I don't deny that the things I did God might have been around somewhere but he had a great big Shield up and he was looking through the blood he was not looking through his M his eyes cuz they would have been very angry but he was looking through a shield of blood knowing that one day he would hear my he'd hear my voice through that blood he say oh I knew you would if I present it to you I knew you would cuz I saw you before the foundation of the world that's much better than him just picking and going now I'll take you and not you I'm I've got one for you but I don't have one for you sorry and and you're you're getting one whether you want it or not no that don't ain't the way God is now we know brother Brown taught us that's not what God did and he didn't put us in a tube and pull us through right that's not predestination predestination is predetermined by for knowledge he saw what You' do therefore he could predestinate to me that's very simple now look if you've got eternal life then it it all it always was eternal life well you can't make it not and God before there was a foundation world look knew that you would be here by what for somebody say it for knowledge knowing all things now watch here's the kicker and when the word or the water the washing of water of the word fell upon you I thought you already had it when it fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father see you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children Sons and Daughters of God of the Living God look if it be that eternal life dwells in you that's righten to me that's so simple Ezekiel 36 now we've been through this we'll go through it just for a few minutes he's talking to Israel he he's telling Israel I'm bringing you back all right I'm going to get a gentile bride but I'm bringing you back too you've been you've been like and see I TP my I look at myself with Israel cuz remember remember our first husband was not God our first husband was a devil right and he had to die that we can what be reborn through Christ right now look oh House of Israel but for my Holy Name sake which you have profaned among the Heathen Heathen wherever you went that's me and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen who's the Heathen us which you have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayith the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in you the only God they're ever going to see is you before their eyes for I will take you from among the Heathen now look hold on he's separating now I'm going to take you from the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land what is Our Land like I said Sunday our land is not a piece of property our land is not a piece of dirt but it is a piece of dirt your dirt you walked in here with it you walked in here with your city your possession and you walked in here with your land today so I will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean praise God from all your filthiness and from all your Idols we all had them will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you now here's your journey here's justification he's going to give you a new heart cuz man you had a Stony heart you didn't care about God you a care about nobody maybe your own self and a new spirit now he's going to give you a new heart and a new spirit now that's not the Holy Spirit but it is part of your journey everybody with me all right stay awake and a new spirit will th put now look within you cuz remember when he puts that Spirit he's talking about which is not the Holy Spirit but it is a spirit from God and even brother Brown says he gives you a new spirit so that you can what live with your own self that's what he said all right and that God can live with you so what does he do when he gives you a new spirit now in sanctification how do you get that new spirit well read it in just a minute you're Washed by the Water of the word that's why you can be justified and not be Sanctified you can be justified believe on the Lord Jesus Christ come right here he'll forgive you of your sins right that's a promise but now when you get up and you go out that door you still got that same guy in you right that made you do the things you just got rid of thank God for a teaching of the prophet and brother Dale and and the brothers were associated with all of us cuz I knew then in say in justification I was I was just beginning was just I was just right at the place to where God could use me or could could could you know wait a minute God finds you not you find God God found you right you just made yourself available all right so I made myself available but you know what I did I didn't say well bless God I got it y'all didn't see me for another three years two years no I knew then I had to come I had to sit and let the water wash me I had to let that thing push that unclean Spirit out cuz well look he said I'll put a my a new spirit not not the Holy Spirit a new spirit within you so when that Spirit comes in brother George now them demons I ain't talking about yours I'm talking about mine and everybody else's they don't go and say Here's a basket of fruit thank you for letting me stay at your house no he looks at you and he says I'll be back buddy I like this place this is my house that's what the Bible says it says calls it his house when the unclean Spirit goes out the devil says I'm going back to my house I felt comfortable in there you have made me totally uncomfortable that's what happens when you're sitting here and you're doing this at church some of you you don't you don't need discernment when you start hitting somebody's soul and a lot of times got that door but if you'll sit here long enough he promised us he'll give us a new spirit and that Spirit though is a holy spirit now I said it wasn't but it is you understand what I mean it's not the Holy Spirit to birth you right but it is the Holy Spirit to push cuz remember can't be two and there at the same time devil and God so you got to push him out so so that spirit's going to come in and push him out by what by the word by you studying like you didn't study before like you come to church like you didn't never come to church before all right pushes it out but remember he don't lock the door yet because you got some work to do right unclean Spirit goes out all right I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of Flesh why because your heart was mad upset angry angry at you angry at the world angry at the preacher angry at everybody but I'll give you a heart of Flesh in other words so I can reach in there and be like the Potter be like the Potter I can Mash that thing down and I can remake the pot and you know how you make a BT you make it from the inside out when you put that thing down the wheel you start punching in first and then you pull it up right from the inside out and you know what it takes if you watch a Potter it takes water they keep having to throw water why cuz he wants you wet he don't want you a dry Christian he don't want you to sit here and go that's right no wait a minute some of y'all raise your hand you'd have to go to the K to the chiropractor to get it put back down well you get happy about other stuff you might as well get happy about the Lord I was somewhere the other day and I'm like wow yeah wow have you ever had a wow moment and wasn't when the blue lights were in your River mirror we talked about that Sunday we won't talk about that in the morning but now look so he pushes out the unclean Spirit right you start coming to church brother Brown said your name goes on the book as a as a as a religious person or a religious order that's what happened to Judas do you know literally there was an unclean Spirit pushed out of Judas because brother Brown said Judas was under sanctification so there was an unclean Spirit pushed out but what happened he may not have believed who Jesus really was and the devil came right back in and said let's get him let's get him so don't let that happen don't stay in sanctification so long that you just become religious religious because when the unclean Spirit goes out I mean we all know some of us clean house better than others but that's okay never has bothered me one way or the other but but have you ever you know you you put on a clean pair of clothes you've been out working all day you know grease everywhere and you clean yourself up wash yourself up scour up real good put you on a good set of clothes don't you feel better that's the same way it should be in sanctification you should feel better you should feel that there's a load been lifted off of you you should feel that that that Lord now start working on me cuz he didn't work on you in justification cuz they were still that unclean Spirit there saying nuh ain't letting you in but when you started coming to church and you started doing the things of God and you started trying trying to do better you're going to fail everybody's going to fail cuz remember those unclean spirits are going to come back but get up and go again listen listen I thank God this is not a oneand done thing I like that person called Grace now not greasy Grace but I like Grace cuz Grace gives you a chance in your Fallen condition so he's going to give you a heart of Flesh in other words so start working on you and you can start raising your hands and if you were all old crusty old thing and you never smiled and you never got happy and uh the world was always against you and and you know you hated everybody and everybody hated you but boy when you come under sanctification I I'm talking about me you you can take your whatever experience you got it's like man this is good amen and you know what helped me more than anything I was in a support group you talking about a support group when you come among Believers that have the new birth that know what you're talking about and says I can help you if you need any help to me that's the greatest thing you'll ever get I don't know how you cannot become a Christian and isolate yourself you know who isolates you right divide and conquer the devil divides you from the fold and he will kill you but now watch then he said I will put I who God I I will put my spirit now here we go I will put my spirit within you and cause you in other words in sanctification and I'll just go and say this and even in justification a lot of you sisters you rebelled against not cutting your hair you rebelled against I know some of you come in and it was like I I see that but some didn't some of you still having problem now but um well you can get quiet if you want to I can see it I'm not stupid I can see pain on the face and I can see fingernails and I can see this and that and the other you need to stop it or you well you've been taught long enough and I'll put my spirit with within you and cause you to walk in my statutes so when you get the new birth it becomes a joy it becomes a joy for for sister junor not to cut her hair it becomes a joy for her not to wear pants it becomes a joy for all of you to be the sisters and the men be the brothers it's a joy this should be a joy that's why I said you should be happy if you're not happy that unclean Spirit has come back and it is tormenting you and tormenting you and tormenting you kick that guy [Applause] out why how by the washing of the water of the word that's why when we get in trouble don't leave the flock right on I don't care if none of them likes you and you don't like none of them if that's true you need to get find another crowd right amen brother Boyd struggled a lot amen I kind of walked through his journey with him right he struggled a lot I say a lot we all have a lot that we struggle with he struggled with certain things I struggle with certain things right but he persevered he never left the fold he never disappeared and that's okay brother George I'm not you know I'm talking about you you know I'm talking about you you know brother I'm I'm how about you buddy you know that right I love you man you're back you're here but don't leave listen cling on to something talk to somebody I better not you know when somebody leaves a church don't let them just drift out in the ocean I don't know why this is but I'm amen why let him drift okay that's why I called brother George and I'd have kept calling him till he answered and I'd have found where he lived and I'd have found him why because I went after somebody you need to go after somebody amen Jun left the church all them years ago this church long time ago no nobody ever called her to see why nobody H sister Gail Addison did I'm sorry one person that's not good that's not good you say well you know I don't want to get in their business I'm in the business of saving people I'm in the business of helping people's lives all right that's my business that's what I get if I get paid that's what I get paid for I don't get paid to just make you feel good if I did we'd have all kind we'd have popcorn and we'd do fireworks and we'd make ice cream and all that stuff during service kids calm down we're not going to do that but it's not it's for saving souls and you start drifting out guess what's going to happen the devil's going to get a hold of you cuz I promise you God's not the one that sent you out there that's right God said come here amen come to me all that are heavy burdened come unto me don't leave me and then he's told us he'd never leave us or forsake us just life lesson somebody disappears let's find them all right and I will put my spirit now that my spirit is God right all right that is what brother R was talking about the eternal life there's only one form and that's eternal life and that emanates from God Almighty all right everybody with me all right so now this we know that this is the burner this is the Holy Ghost in fire that they're talking about when Jesus is telling them go to The Upper Room in other words till you be endued with power from on high this is that power and look and cause you to love to come to church cause you to love to study cause you to love to live a good Christian Life cause you to be a better person to be a better Christian in front of your employees or employer or different or whatever you want to say and you shall keep my judgments and do them look that didn't say begrudgingly or that didn't say I'm going to beat you to do them you shall keep my judgments and do them right proba like what the preacher said the other day he said you do not have to beg a Christian to keep coming to church you don't the other ones you do but Christians you don't Romans 5 vers1 says therefore being justified by what faith this is all based on faith that's based on everything's based on faith amen how many of you saw Jesus down on the cross how many of you saw him resurrect then you got to have it by faith you got to have this whole thing is based brother Brown said this whole thing is faced based on faith believing that what I'm telling you that a man did 2,000 years ago is the truth happen just as sure as we're sitting here today but you got to believe it CU there's a lot of people don't so therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have what access by faith into this grace where when wherewith we stand wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believe not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and then we see that water baptism is our next step then sanctification where we were talking about giving a new heart for this is the will of God even your sanctification Now look for this is the will of God right even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication you say well I don't do that well that can mean a lot of things all right spiritually and physically that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel now when the unclean Spirit goes out see that's a new that's a new thing to you everybody listen just for a minute that's a new thing to you right you were comfortable with what you did before you could go buy a six-pack and not have to look around everybody and make sure the cameras didn't get you and nobody you know your neighbor didn't come in right you just didn't go there anymore you didn't even feel comfortable that every one of you should know how to possess your vessel in sanctification and honor they sanctification you know how by the washing of the water of the word you know how to overcome remember it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome the situation Matthew 12:43 says when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeketh rest and findeth none in other words he's out there where it's dry and and and he's bothered because he can't sit down inside your soul and he can't find rest then he said I will return to my house from whence I came out of and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnish he's like man there's room in here now so he goes and gets seven other demons more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation so how are they going to be Sanctified John 17 says sanctify them what through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so I have sent them into the world he did not pray brother George that that he'd take us out of the world he prayed that we would be Overcomers in the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth 1 Corinthians 6:9 says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators let that sink in idolators let that sink in adulter ERS effeminate look that word up nor abusers of themselves with mankind thieves Covetous drunks dope smokers extortioners H swindlers shall enter or inherit the kingdom of God all right we're done done I'm going to let that Zoom a little bit more I'm going so we're done we're finished that's it the Apostle Paul had them in his congregation too he said and such were some of you but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God how powerful is it that's pretty powerful there's nothing you can do outside of about blaspheming the Holy Ghost that you can't be delivered from come on somebody and get bornn again everybody with me so let's go look for the birth just for a minute so he said I'm going to put my spirit I'm going to put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them Matthew 3:11 say I indeed baptize you with water this is John but he that cometh after me is mightier than I who so shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire he's not just going to just give you the Holy Ghost he didn't just put that lick of fire over the top of them of the 120 that that that thing just disappeared right inside of them right and it didn't go out right don't think when it goes inside you it's supposed to go out no it's supposed to burn all that junk out inside of you and what keep burning keep you clean John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you I like what brother Jason Jackson was saying this weekend which we all go through it I mean we read a book and we listen to a tape and we we just comb through it of course ministers we comb through it a little more maybe than y'all do cuz we're looking for something and then some other preacher gets up and preaches something else at a different angle at a different subject and he make he quotes out of that same book you've been reading for the past two weeks or that same tape that you listen to and you swear somebody put that in there but I like what he said and I believe the same thing it wasn't your time so that was withheld from you you didn't need that to and don't get me wrong you didn't need that to convolute all that cuz you were bringing a subject to you you were bringing a subject all right everybody with me but then when you're when you need that God just pulls his hand back cuz he says right here he said I will bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you acts 1 verse 4 says being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem this is Jesus but wait for the promise of the father Father which he said ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence in other words 11 days later on the day of Pentecost when they therefore were come together they asked said Lord will thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel they didn't even understand what he was talking about and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times of the seasons which the father's put in his own power but you shall receive power after not realize you always won not realize you seed this seed woke up inside of you that's not what he said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is what come upon you it wasn't there it come upon you right and you shall be Witnesses in Jerusalem Judea Samaria uttermost parts of the earth that's us thank God acts 2:4 they were all what filled filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave him utterance acts 9 191 when he came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus find his certain disciples he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe in other words he was watching their their he was sitting in their congregation and he KN he knew there was one thing lacking being a prophet he knew they needed the Holy Ghost he knew they were doing a good job under sanctification they were teaching and they were doing but he knew they were not going to go any further till the Holy Ghost came on those people have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed that's my question tonight have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message and they said unto him we don't know what you're talking about we have not read that book yet we have not listened to that tape yet we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them how are you baptized they said John John was good listen John was a prophet but remember John came to introduce the Messiah not to give people the Holy Ghost Paul came in an open door to bring the Gentiles and get the Holy Ghost to them right amen then Paul said John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that you should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this in other words when they heard this they're like whoa we have never heard this before right but we perceive and believe that something else needs to happen in my life even apollis could get a preacher now to agree he didn't have the new birth there'd be a fight and when Paul had laid hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied if you continue on down through there they all got the Holy Ghost it was a real strong powerful Church there was 12 of them all right Romans 5:5 say hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad what in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us Ephesians 4:29 said let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to you of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption all right grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed and when you're sealed that demon can't get back in because you got all of God in your soul that's exactly what happens that's why the new birth is ill taught because there's still roots of bitterness there's still wrath but look he says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor evil speaking look be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake forgive you let me read this in church order 1958 brother we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but look but it's possible that that same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things he shouldn't do filthy habits of the flesh all right so he's teaching us correct that's justification then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord because remember God won't dwell in an unclean vessel he won't use an unclean person all right so you got to get that unclean Spirit out we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13:12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament now remember sanctification couldn't be taught in the Old Testament there was nothing to sanctify the believer right and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which were living are now living and we also believe that after that person has been Sanctified unclean habits has gone from the person he is a Believer now look sanctification he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate so listen these are definite steps that's why I read this quote these are definite steps that brother breaks them all apart and he says now you're a candidate not that you're going to he he said he didn't didn't say now you're automatically now going to be born again he said you're a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the believer just as many times he's taught like we taught it here one time before you pick up a glass well when when you pick up a glass I don't care how dirty it is if you need a drink of water you picked it up for a purpose so God in justification he picked you up for a purpose but you was dirty filthy had all kind of and everything inside of you but by the washing of the water of the word are putting it in a real good environment of soap and water it got cleaned up then you took that same glass and you poured water in it because remember Sanctified is set aside cleaned and set aside for service in service is the filling and you drink it right very simple so justification is picking it up to use it with a purpose in in heart that's what God does to The Sinner he's still filthy everybody understand that he's still filthy then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service not in service for service in the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service he's talking about literal vessels he ain't talking about people right all right now look we believe that the holy spirit is putting that same vessel in service that's why brother Brown said you shouldn't preach without having the Holy Ghost you shouldn't you shouldn't be a deacon you shouldn't have offices without having the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you are put in service for the Lord now if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right let's read this quote real quick I think this is yeah let's read this real quick and then we'll close works of Faith expressed 1965 now remember this is after the seals broke so a lot of people in the message think that brother brandham changed his way of the of of getting born again after the seals broke all right well let's read 1965 now remember you're in a cycle of three but you're one person like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of three but one person y'all excuse EXC me but these you teeth I keep biting my keep biting my cheek I've lost so much weight I don't feel good chewing on my chewing on my mouth but one person look three attributes of the same God fatherhood three offices like fatherhood sunship Holy Ghost and you are Body Spirit and soul we know that but now watch he said now the outside body has five inlets to it to contact your Earthly home C taste feel smelling here that has nothing to do with your spiritual zero zero why can see so I must be up no you see because you're a human and but listen your sight and all these things can be misinterpreted remember I told you Junes got to to make our our soap that smells like dirt brother George ain't no dirt in it at all it's a chemical in a bottle that we drop into the soap that smells just exactly like dirt but it is not dirt so yours it it just fools all your SE taste feel smelling here all right the inside which is a spirit has five senses conscious love and so forth let me go through a memory reason conscious affection and Imagination but the inside of that the soul has one thing and that's where you live the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things watch this and you do it but that don't mean you're saved think of it Caiaphas prophesied Judas cast out Devils see the spirit anointed him this rain falls on the just and the unjust the weeds can Rejoice with the wheat but it's what it is at the core there's where you can intellectuals can and say oh sure that looks good I believe that I still don't do it no sir the spirit can actually make witness of it and still it isn't so because if that Soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out of here but it cannot be real you can act healing watch this you can act like you have you can act like you receive it now watch this Christians can act like they're Christians H let me read that again Christians can act like they're Christians I'm reading quote and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean they're saved that's exactly right see the spirit can be there look the real genuine Spirit we not even getting into anointed ones because we don't have time but it is next the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's God eternal life it all now look it always was eternal life what eternal life was already eternal life not your soul it came from God it goes to God it's the soul what the soul you have now not that you got another Soul it's the soul that's regenerated now listen your soul came from God it doesn't matter if you're a sinner or a saint so you had to have not an exchange of your soul or you'd be another person but God come in and clean the nature of that old of your soul out and put his nature in really simple which is the what is the nature of God eternal life so we'll stop right there let's stand our feet come on musicians I like I love that quote Christians can act like they're Christian and act like they're ever so good at it I get to this point in anointings where many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in th name look prophesied Caiaphas prophesied the truth and in thy name cast out Devils Judas can say that and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew now that word knew is not like me knowing s Anna it's like me knowing sister Jim right like Adam knew his wife Eve if you look that word up you'll see that it's a relationship different than just shaking hands and knowing somebody so depart from me I in other words I never had an intimate relationship with you depart from me ye that work iniquity then he talks about the anointing
