[4:56] his wonderful exceeding blessings in
[4:58] this hour
[4:59] Amen we are blessed people in this hour
[5:02] amen I believe that and where no matter
[5:04] if the things are bleak no matter things
[5:06] look look bad amen but I believe that we
[5:09] are blessed people still because God's
[5:12] in control Amen you and I you and me may
[5:15] not be in control but God is and God's
[5:18] very aware that you and I his bride is
[5:20] still here on this earth and that's all
[5:23] he cares about
[5:24] amen praise God so so we're just going
[5:28] to go ahead and go to the word but we're
[5:31] gonna read from Isaiah chapter 26 Isaiah
[5:34] chapter 26
[5:38] Isaiah 26
[5:40] we'll start at verse 1 I'm gonna read
[5:43] verse 1 through 8 and then I'm gonna
[5:46] read verses 17 through verse 21 Bible
[5:49] says here Isaiah in that day shall this
[5:52] song be sung in the land of Judah
[5:54] we have straw we have a strong City
[5:57] salvation will God a point for walls and
[6:00] bulwarks open ye the gates that the
[6:03] righteous nation which keepeth the truth
[6:05] may enter in that will keep him in
[6:09] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[6:12] thee
[6:13] because he trusted in thee trust ye in
[6:18] the Lord forever
[6:20] for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
[6:23] strength let's go down to verse 17 pay
[6:28] attention to these verses like as a
[6:31] woman with child that draw earth near
[6:33] the time of her delivery is in pain and
[6:36] cries out and her pains so have we been
[6:40] in thy sight O Lord we have been with
[6:44] child we have been in pain we have as it
[6:48] were brought forth wind we have not raw
[6:51] any deliverance in the earth neither
[6:53] have the inhabitants of the world fallen
[6:55] the dead man shall live together with my
[7:00] dead body shall they arise awake and
[7:03] sing ye that dwell and dust for thy due
[7:07] is as the dew of herbs and the earth
[7:10] shall cast out the dead amen come my
[7:15] people enter thou into thy chambers and
[7:18] shut thy doors about thee hide thyself
[7:21] as it were for a little moment until the
[7:24] indignation be over past for behold the
[7:28] Lord cometh out of his place to punish
[7:31] the inhabitants of the earth for their
[7:33] iniquity the earth also shall disclose
[7:36] her blood and shall no more cover her
[7:40] slain I want you to keep in mind saying
[7:43] to that as we read these things you know
[7:45] the Bible said and the Bible has
[7:49] compound meanings amen
[7:52] so it can be talking this is applying to
[7:54] to Israel they men but I believe also
[7:56] it's applying to us in this hour amen I
[7:59] was looking at this scripture in it and
[8:01] it the other day and I noticed this you
[8:04] may have read it before not but I
[8:06] thought it was very appropriate
[8:07] especially when this hour that we're
[8:09] living in and I just wanted to title
[8:11] this amen this call it shut in with God
[8:14] shut in with God amen so we're gonna
[8:16] look at something here in just a moment
[8:17] then you just pray for us maybe the Lord
[8:20] will give us something that can help us
[8:22] during this hour amen
[8:23] let's just borrow hats our precious
[8:26] Heavenly Father we come be
[8:27] for you Lord once again we thank you
[8:29] Lord for the opportunity that we have to
[8:32] open back the pages of your word Lord
[8:33] and father we know the Lord Jesus that
[8:36] without you we are nothing father God
[8:38] without you Lord God we would surely
[8:40] fall Lord where would we be father if it
[8:43] wasn't for your mercy and grace in this
[8:45] hour Lord God father some of us would be
[8:47] in a hospital Lord God some of us would
[8:49] be fathered maybe in a jail cell Lord
[8:52] and some of us father maybe in a casket
[8:54] dead Lord God but Lord Jesus who do you
[8:58] father God to bring us father got into
[9:01] this very hour that we are living in
[9:03] father because Lord you have promised in
[9:06] your word that you would have abroad
[9:07] without spot or wrinkle Lord Jesus and I
[9:10] believe father God with all my heart
[9:12] that that's that's the people that I'm
[9:14] standing here with in this building in
[9:16] this our Lord Jesus and Lord God you or
[9:19] you will have a many membered brought
[9:20] and you do have a many member brought in
[9:22] this our Father throughout all the world
[9:25] Lord Jesus and I pray that you help us
[9:27] to step into that promise Lord God
[9:29] because father God it is father God real
[9:33] and it is your truth lord I ask that
[9:35] you'd meet the needs amongst us now
[9:37] father God speak to us through your word
[9:39] Lord Jesus and help me to get aside Lord
[9:42] Jesus so that you'd speak only father
[9:44] God what you desire for your people to
[9:46] hear Lord God and not my own words but
[9:48] your words Lord we commit ourselves into
[9:51] you now commit this time can continue to
[9:53] be with brother Wade Lord and traveling
[9:55] bring them back safely and father God
[9:57] would just thank you once again for your
[9:59] blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[10:01] amen god bless you Saint you may be
[10:03] seated in this hour amen
[10:11] amen so we want to look at something
[10:14] here because I believe as you and as you
[10:20] and I know you know we've experienced in
[10:22] the past few months some pretty abrupt
[10:25] changes and and all of us can definitely
[10:29] feel that those changes have impacted us
[10:31] one way or another and I don't think
[10:34] anybody in this world could say that
[10:36] these changes have not impacted us amen
[10:39] but you know most of us in our mind
[10:43] would have never fathomed Amen how
[10:45] quickly society and the way of life
[10:47] would have changed the way it was two
[10:50] months ago it's completely different
[10:52] today Amen we went had never fathomed
[10:55] that things would have turned out like
[10:57] this
[10:58] and the things to turn in a blink of an
[11:02] eye amen panic and fear you know has
[11:05] struck the the land has struck the
[11:07] people of the world you go out to the
[11:10] store you know yesterday we were out in
[11:12] them in the in the market and you can
[11:14] just see it in their eyes you can see it
[11:16] in the people's eyes there they're not
[11:18] reacting the same it's totally different
[11:20] of course that's all you can see is
[11:22] their eyes but but you can just see it
[11:27] it's it's totally changed them amen and
[11:30] it's completely it's completely fulfills
[11:35] what what God said in the word amen that
[11:38] then the last days man's hearts will be
[11:40] failing them for fear for the things
[11:42] that would come to pass mning on the
[11:46] earth amen
[11:47] we're seeing before our very eyes an
[11:49] economy that had been flourishing amen
[11:51] for the past three and a half years they
[11:54] had been growing amen we've seen it in
[11:57] two months completely tanked record
[11:59] numbers of unemployment business is
[12:02] shutting down people in lines four or
[12:06] five hours in cars waiting for just some
[12:08] free groceries it's totally different
[12:11] people who had stable jobs for many
[12:13] years now don't even have business now
[12:16] they're facing businesses shutting down
[12:18] now they're facing layoffs and
[12:21] looking for unemployment something that
[12:23] they've never even done before and
[12:25] that's what we're seeing in this hour
[12:26] amen and we are also seeing Amen where
[12:30] where the assembling of ourselves
[12:32] together to worship has been hindered
[12:35] something that you are not have at least
[12:38] in my lifetime I've never seen the way
[12:41] it has been hindered in this hour the
[12:44] way that you and I in this hour we
[12:48] desires the true son and daughter of God
[12:50] desire to fulfill what it says there in
[12:53] Hebrews where it says do not forsake
[12:55] themselves of your SEM assembling
[12:57] together we desire that as a true son
[13:00] and daughter of God yet is being
[13:02] hindered in this hour and and you know
[13:05] what saints it might be hindered the way
[13:07] it is right now and it probably may get
[13:09] worse later down the road but you know
[13:11] what the thing is that we need to we
[13:14] need to ask ourselves things are still
[13:18] you still have food on your table you
[13:20] still have clothes on your back we still
[13:22] can open the church doors and we still
[13:25] can see one another we could still call
[13:28] one another we could still talk one
[13:30] another even if it is through text or
[13:31] whatever amen but a my couple point in
[13:34] time where none of we're not going to be
[13:36] able to even walk through those doors
[13:38] what if it comes to that point in time
[13:40] because brother Branham even talked
[13:41] about these things they might turn these
[13:44] churches into storehouses now I'm not
[13:47] trying to bring fear I'm not trying to
[13:48] bring panic but I'm trying to get to a
[13:50] point what are you going to do then if
[13:55] you are not allowing this opportunity
[13:59] right now to experience and to draw
[14:01] closer to God because I believe God is
[14:04] very mindful that his bride is here on
[14:07] earth and he only cares about two things
[14:09] fulfilling his word and for his bride to
[14:11] get ready amen so if he if that's the
[14:14] only things he took that he cares about
[14:16] and if you are struggling in this hour
[14:18] to even take the opportunity to draw
[14:21] closer to God to get in his word to pray
[14:24] more to seek Him more to let him talk
[14:28] back to you because I believe we have
[14:29] more time than we ever had before
[14:32] I believe that with all my heart I know
[14:35] I have and if you are not getting into
[14:38] God in this hour and you think that you
[14:40] could just still live life the way Amen
[14:43] that means you have a spiritual personal
[14:45] problem that you need help from God
[14:48] because things are going to get worse
[14:50] later on churches are going to close and
[14:53] you're not going to have a physical
[14:55] place to worship and what then you
[14:57] better be in Christ you better be in his
[14:59] word you better be in a personal
[15:02] relationship with God because the
[15:04] government's not going to save you
[15:05] nobody is going to save you only God in
[15:08] his word his name Amen
[15:09] there's a strong tower Amen in this hour
[15:11] for you and I for those that love Him
[15:15] praise God
[15:17] so we know that God is coming back for
[15:20] his bride you know in the midst of this
[15:23] panic and confusion God is only
[15:25] concerned about coming to get that
[15:27] little bride God isn't concerned about
[15:30] you and I remember he said that he would
[15:32] not put more on a stay where we could
[15:35] handle right he said that in his word
[15:38] now we still have it easy yes we do
[15:42] this isn't nothing amen it could get a
[15:48] little bit more squeezed later on a
[15:50] little bit more squeeze later down the
[15:52] road what will you do then what will you
[15:56] do then what attitude will you have then
[15:59] amen and I believe that right now this
[16:02] is a little time for us to get ready for
[16:04] that this is that's how God don't see it
[16:08] as a bleak thing as a you know as a as a
[16:12] terrible thing see it as an opportunity
[16:14] for you and I in this hour because I
[16:16] believe it's an opportunity for us in
[16:18] this hour amen and and he he made a
[16:22] promise God made a promise to her
[16:24] through his word and she's believing
[16:26] that promise we're believing that
[16:28] promise that God is going to fulfill
[16:30] that promise amen that he has made to us
[16:32] through his word and you know it reminds
[16:34] me of that story that brother Brown told
[16:36] about that little girl that little
[16:38] washed girl who was looking who was
[16:41] minding her own business and she was the
[16:43] not as
[16:44] pretty as the girls the local girls in
[16:46] the town and she was just minding her
[16:48] own business doing her work just being a
[16:50] just a little washed girl and there came
[16:54] one time a man from another state a rich
[16:58] a rich young man looking for a bride he
[17:01] was looking for a woman that he wanted
[17:03] to marry and he went to that specific
[17:05] town to find himself a wife he looked at
[17:08] all the the neighboring all the girls in
[17:10] the town and there just none of them
[17:13] could fit hit what he was looking for
[17:15] they they were they look pretty they had
[17:18] beautiful clothes they might even have
[17:20] come from lines of families that were
[17:23] rich but you know what it didn't fit
[17:25] what he was looking for until he saw
[17:27] that little washed girl and that little
[17:29] washed girl a man had a character in her
[17:32] a man that he had not seen in any of the
[17:35] other ones but he saw it in her and she
[17:38] just kept to mind her business minding
[17:40] her business and probably what drawed
[17:41] her to his attention his day she wasn't
[17:44] there trying to get his attention that's
[17:47] that's a good girl young man if you are
[17:50] if you see her just telling you this you
[17:53] see girls they were trying to get your
[17:54] attention you better believe that might
[17:56] be a one to stay away from I'm just
[17:58] telling you young people she was not
[18:01] there trying to flirt with him she was
[18:03] not there trying to get his attention
[18:05] amen she was just minding her business
[18:08] and he said that's the one I want so he
[18:10] went up to her and he said are you
[18:12] willing to marry me and she said yes but
[18:15] she but he said all right I'll come back
[18:17] a year from now and that stood to her
[18:21] that was such a great thing for her and
[18:23] it was it was locked in in her for a
[18:28] whole year that's all she had in her
[18:30] mind he's coming for me the same time
[18:33] next year
[18:33] amen he's coming for me that he promised
[18:36] it and I believe it and everything she
[18:40] did a man it was because she was wanted
[18:42] for that promise to be fulfilled amen
[18:45] it was she was so concentrated on that
[18:47] promise she was locked down by that
[18:49] promise made to her she couldn't do
[18:51] anything but to keep that promise in the
[18:53] forefront of everything that she did and
[18:56] you know what says that little
[18:57] girl that that young girl amen and we
[18:59] know the story eventually he came back
[19:01] the same year and took her away people
[19:04] filled his promise and brother Brian
[19:06] typed that as the bride and crying
[19:09] Christ amen
[19:10] God has promised us in this hour great
[19:13] things to take place we're still looking
[19:17] for a resurrection to take place what a
[19:19] great promise that we have in this hour
[19:21] that the dead Saints shall rise amen and
[19:24] that we are going to see them physically
[19:26] walk among us and after that a rapture a
[19:30] man to meet him in the sky I don't know
[19:33] of any greater thing than that Saints
[19:35] that trumps any any virus that trumps
[19:37] anything going on right now with the
[19:40] government that trumps anything amen
[19:41] look into those things amen that trumps
[19:44] it all amen
[19:45] but you know what that little girl that
[19:48] young watch girl she was probably in her
[19:50] room it secretly every day every now and
[19:53] then in the little room that she was
[19:54] looking at she would look at herself in
[19:56] the mirror and say how could she he
[19:58] choose me how in the world could he
[20:00] choose me and she'd look at herself I'm
[20:02] not like the other girls I mean look at
[20:04] the pretty gowns they have look at what
[20:06] they have and yet what came back to her
[20:09] was that promise that promise was what
[20:12] motivated her but he said Amen he said
[20:16] that he was coming back I don't know why
[20:18] but he said he was and I'm just gonna
[20:21] and she would maybe look and see how
[20:23] that that wedding gown she would
[20:25] eventually she eventually got that
[20:27] wedding gown and she would try it on
[20:29] every now and then just like you and I a
[20:30] man should be being dressed on a daily
[20:33] basis with that wedding gown that word
[20:36] and she would look and see it knit and
[20:40] injure yes it looks good it looks good
[20:43] but she would then she would have to
[20:44] take it off because eventually that
[20:46] marriages was gonna take place she
[20:48] wanted to preserve it amen
[20:51] for us Saints in this out we need to
[20:53] keep that wedding garment on amen
[20:56] consistently amen praise God and and
[21:00] just to move on eventually eventually
[21:02] Saints that promise that was made to her
[21:04] became a reality to her amen
[21:08] and the same thing with us Saints that
[21:10] promise
[21:10] that was made to us through his word
[21:12] will become a reality to you and I it
[21:15] may not feel like it right now it may
[21:18] not even look like it right now but I
[21:19] believe that it is becoming that reality
[21:22] there's things that we see that we saw
[21:25] as a shadow the things that we see as a
[21:28] shadow will eventually become the
[21:30] reality amen
[21:31] you will be able to touch it and feel it
[21:34] amen
[21:35] praise God so we've been hearing that
[21:40] term locked down a lot lately and and
[21:43] and I was looking I was looking at what
[21:45] that term means and it in two meanings
[21:49] that caught my attention was a state of
[21:51] isolation or restricted access
[21:53] instituted as a security measure another
[21:56] one is a freeze or a pause now we see it
[22:01] in the end of physical amen but we also
[22:03] know remember I always keep this in the
[22:06] forefront God still has his people here
[22:09] on earth you and I are still are if
[22:12] you're part of the Bride of Christ you
[22:14] and me are still here on earth nothing
[22:16] can be whole nothing can be it can be
[22:18] follows without God knowing about it
[22:21] nothing can be follows or can or can
[22:23] hurt us without God not not not knowing
[22:26] or allowing it in our lives if it
[22:29] happened to job and that was in the old
[22:31] test and how much more in the house
[22:32] under the new birth with the Holy Ghost
[22:35] that's that promise stands firmly and I
[22:39] know that it stinks that we have to stay
[22:41] locked in and we have to end out and you
[22:43] know we thank God for a little bit of
[22:45] opening seems like some governments are
[22:47] opening them back up a little bit more
[22:49] but you know what Saints to you and I we
[22:52] should still be shut in spiritually we
[23:00] should still be shut in do you realize
[23:03] that maybe God is allowing this because
[23:07] you're so in you're so caught up you
[23:10] were so caught up two months ago with
[23:11] your daily routine of life with your
[23:14] with your with with the constant things
[23:16] of this way of this world dragging you
[23:19] down and God's given you an opportunity
[23:22] get in and get shut in with him now it's
[23:27] the time you know it was when Elijah
[23:29] amen he heard him through the through
[23:32] the Thunder roaring through the cyclone
[23:34] passing by through the Lightning
[23:36] flashing but it was when that still
[23:38] small voice came in that he said yes God
[23:42] is here and he heard from God and it's
[23:46] in that still small voice that God wants
[23:48] to talk to you and he's been trying to
[23:50] talk to his people throughout this whole
[23:52] time let's just say 50 years he's been
[23:57] trying to speak to us in a still small
[23:59] voice but we don't we fail to hear him
[24:02] because we allow everything else in our
[24:04] lives to drown that still small voice
[24:06] out we allow TV we allow movies with our
[24:10] video games we allow people we allow the
[24:12] news we allow everything around us with
[24:14] jobs and even family to draw that step
[24:18] that's still small voice out of our
[24:20] lives but now you have no excuse now you
[24:27] we have no excuse amen
[24:30] you know one thing's for sure Saints got
[24:33] with this I've said God's allowing it it
[24:35] doesn't matter what you or I personally
[24:38] think about what's happening you know
[24:40] you have your opinion I may have my
[24:42] opinion but one thing's for certain god
[24:44] amen is on the scene it is in control
[24:48] amen god amen it still has a many
[24:52] membered bride in this our living on
[24:54] this earth that is going to fulfill that
[24:56] promise amen
[24:58] somebody is going to manifest Jesus
[25:00] Christ even in this kovat 19 hour amen
[25:05] because he promised that he that there
[25:07] would be a bride without spot or wrinkle
[25:10] amen it doesn't matter
[25:13] but God is very mindful that his little
[25:16] bride is still here on earth praise God
[25:20] and you know I personally like I said I
[25:24] personally believe that the things that
[25:25] are unfolding at this time our
[25:27] opportunities for you and I to get in
[25:30] tune with God to get in tune with God
[25:33] amen this is an opportunity for God
[25:36] to fulfill his promise of having a broad
[25:39] without spot or wrinkle they meant
[25:40] through you through you in this hour
[25:44] it's so easy to get caught up with the
[25:46] with the physical things of this life
[25:48] look what second Corinthians chapter
[25:49] four says if the brothers can bring that
[25:52] up so you can read it along with me
[25:53] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 17
[25:55] says Paul saying for our light
[25:57] affliction which is but for a moment I
[26:01] think that with it's a light affliction
[26:04] because none of us are in a hospital
[26:06] right now none of us are are we still
[26:08] are eating steak we're still we're still
[26:10] enjoying entertainment and things as
[26:13] such for our light affliction which is
[26:15] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[26:18] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[26:19] glory verse eighteen while we look not
[26:23] at the things which are seen but at the
[26:26] things which are not seen for the things
[26:29] which are seen are temporal but the
[26:32] things which are not seen are eternal
[26:35] amen
[26:36] praise God those are the things that we
[26:38] need to look at amen we can get so
[26:41] caught up with the news we could get so
[26:43] caught up with what's going on amen but
[26:46] those are things that are seen it's the
[26:48] things that are unseen that God is
[26:50] trying to get our attention with and
[26:52] that's what we try we shun away because
[26:56] it's not so glamorous and it's not so
[26:59] pretty and I don't understand it but
[27:03] that's the only thing that's gonna those
[27:05] are the things that are gonna change
[27:05] your body those are the things the
[27:10] things that are not seen is what will
[27:11] change your body the things that are not
[27:14] seen is what will bring the dead from
[27:16] the ground amen
[27:19] those are the things that that that
[27:21] matter in this life because look the
[27:23] things that are seen are temporal the
[27:25] Bible says but the things which are not
[27:27] seen are eternal just as eternal as that
[27:31] word that's in you right now
[27:34] amen right praise God so what should we
[27:37] be looking at and so this one a good go
[27:43] with this in into the the heart of the
[27:47] message I guess because Saints in there
[27:49] are many
[27:50] instances in the scripture where being
[27:52] shut-in was a necessity for both safety
[27:55] and spiritual reasons and you could see
[27:57] it in many different scriptures in many
[27:59] different passages let's look at for
[28:02] example Noah and his family Noah and his
[28:05] family shut-in the ark safe from the
[28:08] storm now God was the one who told him
[28:13] to build that Ark God was the one who
[28:17] said I have found no grace and nobody
[28:20] else but Noah and it was it was it was
[28:24] big I guess Noah had believed God's Word
[28:27] before then God wouldn't didn't mine to
[28:30] give him his word to go build an ark
[28:32] amen so he built that Ark took God by
[28:35] his promise he'd never seen rain he'd
[28:37] never seen anything like that but he he
[28:40] believed God and he went on and took out
[28:43] of his promise and look what Genesis 716
[28:45] says and they that went in went in male
[28:48] and female of all flesh as God had
[28:50] commanded him and watched the Lord shut
[28:53] him in and the Lord shut him in it was
[28:58] the Lord that shut Noah and his family
[29:00] in and as they were shut in God was
[29:03] still in control chaos was outside the
[29:07] world was dying the world was drowning
[29:09] the animals were dying nature was in
[29:12] chaos but he was safe in the Ark of God
[29:16] he was safe because he was in his
[29:19] promise he was an obedience to his word
[29:22] amen and that's what God wants us to be
[29:26] in this our Saints to be in obedience to
[29:29] his word when you are in obedience to
[29:32] his word amen then God can it God is
[29:34] able to take you out out of out of a
[29:38] tutu to keep you safe in this hour when
[29:41] you are in obedience to his word amen
[29:45] when you believe his word God can keep
[29:48] you safe in this hour let's look at for
[29:50] example the children of Israel when they
[29:52] first ate the Passover there's another
[29:55] look what what look what Exodus 12 21 23
[29:59] says or it says then Moses called for
[30:01] all the elders of Israel and said unto
[30:03] them draw
[30:03] out and take you a lamb according to
[30:06] your families and kill the Passover and
[30:08] ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip
[30:10] it in the blood that is in the basin and
[30:12] strike the lentil and the two side posts
[30:15] with the blood that is in the basin and
[30:17] none of you shall go out at the door for
[30:20] his house until the morning and we know
[30:23] that it was because the death angel was
[30:25] coming through but you know what Saints
[30:29] they had to obey the prophets word first
[30:33] because otherwise whether they were out
[30:35] or they were in there's the angel if
[30:38] they didn't obey that word the angel was
[30:39] still gonna what is going to get that
[30:41] firstborn they had to be in obedience to
[30:45] that word they had to be amen and then
[30:48] it was inside there it was inside there
[30:51] that they did they were able to gather
[30:53] with their families and feed off the
[30:56] lamb
[30:57] have communion with one another and with
[31:02] the lamb eat off the land and you know
[31:10] what they had to eat all of it not just
[31:13] a little bit but all of it they had to
[31:16] eat so it was a time for them that God
[31:18] allowed Hey look the Angel of Death is
[31:20] out here in this hour amen but you can
[31:24] be safe inside amen nope not physically
[31:27] I don't mean physically but I'm talking
[31:29] about you safe ins in Christ amen
[31:32] feeding off of him eating off his word
[31:35] amen and that word changing you from the
[31:37] inside out preparing you for deliverance
[31:41] in this hour amen
[31:42] because it's going home time Saints it's
[31:45] going home time and for the Lord will
[31:48] pass through to smite the Egyptians and
[31:50] when he seeth the blood upon the lintel
[31:53] and on the two posts the Lord will pass
[31:55] over the door and will not suffer the
[31:57] destroyer to come in unto your houses to
[31:59] smite you amen praise God
[32:02] how many thank God for that amen
[32:05] another example we can look at is God
[32:08] watching over David shutting him in in
[32:11] the caves from Saul you know it was God
[32:15] that led David amen
[32:17] through in his lifetime sure David make
[32:20] mistakes and sure David fell and David
[32:22] did his own thing at times but you know
[32:24] what God was in control of his life amen
[32:28] he knew his heart David had a heart Amen
[32:32] that I want I want to serve God I want
[32:35] that that's he's the only one that that
[32:37] fulfills my life killing a giant in
[32:40] fulfill his life being the king didn't
[32:44] fulfill his life but the only thing that
[32:46] fulfill his life is being in constant
[32:48] fellowship with him in his word amen and
[32:51] he expresses this throughout the Psalms
[32:53] many times look what songs fifty seven
[32:56] one says he says to the chief musician
[32:58] out to shift mix them of David when he
[33:01] fled from Saul in the cave be merciful
[33:05] unto me O God be merciful unto me for my
[33:07] soul trusteth in DEA in the shadow of
[33:10] thy wings will I make my refuge until
[33:13] these calamities be over passed there
[33:17] was a time it was a time of worrying and
[33:21] in frightened during this time that he
[33:23] was being chased chased down by Saul
[33:26] because he knew that Saul wanted his
[33:28] life and say Satan in this hour wants
[33:30] your life he would do anything he could
[33:33] if he could take your life oh my but you
[33:37] know what God has hidden us Amen
[33:39] especially his little bride he has
[33:40] hidden us in his bosom in that spiritual
[33:43] cave amen we're not even Satan can do
[33:45] anything to us unless God allows it amen
[33:49] unless God permits it amen he cannot
[33:52] hurt one hair on top of your head amen
[33:57] you know I was reading I was listening
[33:59] to this Jewish rabbi the other day and
[34:01] he brought out something very
[34:02] interesting he said David one time was
[34:06] and you may have heard this but one time
[34:09] David was walking through the fields
[34:11] when he was younger caring for his dad's
[34:13] sheep and he was just looking at nature
[34:17] and how and how nature would produce
[34:19] something they would give back something
[34:22] the honeybee would give back honey
[34:25] you know the the the the the the calf
[34:29] would give
[34:31] meet you see the cow would give me the
[34:33] or give milk
[34:35] the the sheep would give wool a man they
[34:38] would give back something and then he
[34:40] started he was walking and he noticed
[34:42] the spider he noticed a little spider
[34:45] and he said he could not pinpoint why it
[34:47] was the reason for the spider he said
[34:50] what is the reason for the spider and so
[34:54] later later on years down the road when
[34:58] he came to this point in his life where
[35:00] saul was was was was chasing him he went
[35:03] into a cave and saul was nearby but
[35:09] there was a little spider that had made
[35:12] a little spider web at the entrance of
[35:14] the cave and saul and his men then
[35:18] bothered looking into that cave because
[35:21] they do you think there was anybody in
[35:22] there because of the little spider web
[35:25] and they just walked by now this is a
[35:28] this is according to the I think it was
[35:30] in the Talmud the the Hebrew Talmud and
[35:33] I don't know if it's true or not but he
[35:36] they would realize there is a purpose
[35:38] for all things all things have a purpose
[35:41] it was in that moment that little
[35:44] insignificant spider amen you might know
[35:47] it's saying in the corner and it's
[35:48] probably just sitting there doing it you
[35:50] think it's not doing anything but God
[35:52] has it there for a purpose and you know
[35:55] what a spider has one of the strongest
[35:57] materials there isn't in the world and
[36:00] that's their web that little bitty thing
[36:03] could be a little small bitty spider not
[36:06] necessarily a big one but the size of
[36:08] your hand but it could it could be a
[36:10] little spider God has a purpose for all
[36:11] that just as these little times as these
[36:14] times that we have saints we don't may
[36:16] not understand them but God has a
[36:17] purpose for all of it sings God has a
[36:20] purpose for why we are here in this hour
[36:23] with so many few people God has a
[36:26] purpose for amen it's it's difficult
[36:30] especially for us ministers do not get
[36:34] the sisters amens too
[36:36] a man but it's it's God knows the reason
[36:42] why a man God knows the reason why you
[36:47] know we look at Jesus another example
[36:49] Jesus being shut in there was a time
[36:52] where he had to be shut in with God you
[36:55] know he had he he was within himself he
[36:59] was a human just as much as he was God
[37:01] and and he was he didn't want to go and
[37:05] die on that cross humanly Ethan wants
[37:08] him but he knew something deep down and
[37:11] in him caused them and would push him
[37:14] this must needs to be happen in the read
[37:17] and the thing that that pushed him was
[37:19] not really the fact to do it but it was
[37:22] because the word needed to be fulfilled
[37:24] there were scriptures in the Bible that
[37:27] needed to be fulfilled even right there
[37:29] on the cross so many promises and so
[37:32] many scriptures were fulfilled even just
[37:35] right there on the cross but Jesus came
[37:36] to that point that he had to die to
[37:38] himself he got down and he said Lord let
[37:41] it not be my will but thy will be done
[37:43] it was in the secret of the night while
[37:46] the disciples were sleeping and nobody
[37:49] knew anything about it but God was doing
[37:51] something supernatural there in the min
[37:53] in that moment and God gave him the
[37:57] strength amen and angels came down and
[37:59] ministered to him amen and you and I in
[38:02] this hour we cried we have to have our
[38:04] own gets M&E amen
[38:06] could it be this time could it be this
[38:09] is the time for us to have our own gets
[38:11] M&E amen
[38:13] you may not understand it and you may
[38:16] not want to go through it you know what
[38:19] Saints a battle in my mind this is me
[38:23] speaking but I battle in my mind humanly
[38:25] speaking because I think of my daughters
[38:28] I think of my wife I think of my family
[38:31] I think of their innocency and I think
[38:34] of what what what could happen to them
[38:37] but yet I have to I have to sit and say
[38:40] Lord you promised in your word that you
[38:42] would give me my children you promised
[38:44] in your word that none that you
[38:46] you would you would protect not just me
[38:49] but you would protect my family as well
[38:51] they men you promised it in your word
[38:56] Lord and you have to believe God's Word
[39:00] and get down and say Lord this is what
[39:02] you promised and so this is what I'm
[39:04] gonna act upon is that there's no sense
[39:06] of me and worrying there's no sense in
[39:09] me and in amen
[39:10] when there's still glorious things to
[39:13] look forward to and I know that those
[39:15] scriptures still need to be fulfilled
[39:17] and I'm gonna be here to fulfill them by
[39:20] God's grace I'm gonna be here to see a
[39:23] resurrection amen by God's grace God
[39:27] doesn't take me before that and I
[39:29] believe that you desire the same thing
[39:31] as well amen so Jesus he had to isolate
[39:34] himself from the world in order to
[39:37] receive strength from from on high amen
[39:40] and then another great thing that took
[39:42] place is deal 120 120 in the upper room
[39:46] they had to shut themselves in yeah they
[39:49] had to shut themselves in in order for
[39:51] them to receive power amen to go and and
[39:54] do what they did afterwards we know this
[39:56] story I'm not going to dwell there but
[39:58] they were scared they were scared of the
[40:00] Sanhedrin they were scared of the the
[40:02] Jews out there they were scared all they
[40:05] had was just the promise of Jesus and
[40:07] with that promise a man they went in but
[40:11] they came out with much more than that
[40:13] better than that fulfill in their lives
[40:15] amen because why they shut themselves in
[40:18] it was just damning God and said Lord
[40:19] you said in your you said before you
[40:22] ascended yeah that you would do this and
[40:26] you would send the Holy Ghost amen and
[40:28] we believe it and that settles it and
[40:30] God did the rest well do you want that
[40:34] in your life and decide or we're gonna
[40:37] just go just sit back and look at that
[40:40] news and be afraid and scared and and
[40:43] and or do you want to come out with
[40:46] power from on high
[40:47] amen I believe we need to be sensitive
[40:50] sensible I'm not saying for us not to be
[40:52] sensible but there should be something
[40:55] within us a man that that's more than
[40:57] what's going on in this earth they meant
[41:00] draws you to a greater promise than CNN
[41:02] and in the NBC amen and that's his word
[41:07] that's his promise yes you notice that
[41:10] that that pyramid this this this smaller
[41:13] pyramid is much smaller it's a smaller
[41:17] little little little little putt and
[41:19] nobody knows anything about Harley
[41:21] that's where God wants to meet us amen
[41:25] and that little secret that in that
[41:28] little secret room amen you know if you
[41:32] look back at the woman at the well you
[41:34] know she had she had life going on she
[41:36] had five husbands and we know but and
[41:41] living her life and and probably just it
[41:44] was a daily routine amen but one day she
[41:47] went again to the well as she had
[41:50] accustomed to go every day at noon after
[41:55] all the other girls had gone she had to
[41:59] go there by herself but she couldn't be
[42:02] with the other girls who were pure and
[42:04] virgin and she was she was marked by the
[42:09] world
[42:09] she was marked but one time there was
[42:13] the Lord Jesus right there in that in
[42:16] that well right there sitting right
[42:19] there next to that well and you better
[42:21] believe he knew exactly why he was there
[42:23] cuz the Bible says so he knew exactly
[42:27] what was gonna happen and he was not
[42:29] afraid to be seen with a woman that was
[42:31] marked read by society he wasn't scared
[42:35] of that he was looking for that soul he
[42:38] was looking for he was looking Amen to
[42:40] have to have something change in her
[42:42] life and right there when she took the
[42:47] time to talk to the word when she took a
[42:51] little secret away from from this from
[42:54] the main city away from from society she
[42:57] right there where the well of water was
[42:59] there was a physical well of water but
[43:01] yet the real well of water was the one
[43:03] talking to her talking to her and
[43:06] because she took that time God was able
[43:09] to do something great for her in that
[43:11] out discerned her life
[43:13] she she went running to the gum see a
[43:16] man who told me the things that I've
[43:18] done and you know that's what can happen
[43:21] to you and I when we get in secret with
[43:23] God amen nobody has to know
[43:26] amen nobody has to know but you and God
[43:29] and when you and when you take God at
[43:32] His Word and you say Lord I believe your
[43:34] word and that settles it Lord Here I am
[43:36] talk to me he but I believe he'll speak
[43:38] back to you sometimes we think that we
[43:41] have to do all of the speaking when we
[43:43] pray when we but is God also wants to
[43:46] talk to us God also wants to talk to us
[43:49] through his word and if you just stay
[43:50] still sometimes you he'll even put
[43:53] things in your mind and in your heart
[43:55] that's how that's happened to me because
[43:58] the Bible says that it'll be the Holy
[43:59] Ghost speaking through you amen those
[44:02] things that are needful in this hour
[44:04] amen amen I'm almost done Saints do you
[44:07] remember that little secret brew roomed
[44:09] that brother branham's saw there in that
[44:11] vision now if you read in Psalms chapter
[44:15] 91 verse 1 Psalms 91 Bible says here he
[44:22] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[44:24] Most High shall abide under the shadow
[44:28] of the Almighty amen and it's
[44:33] interesting that David put it that way
[44:34] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[44:37] the Most High not not that that not that
[44:41] that stays there for a little of
[44:43] temporarily amen but that dwelleth in
[44:45] amen you dwell in your home you don't
[44:49] just stay there three days out of the
[44:51] year you dwell in it 365 days of the
[44:55] years you know unless we're in a hotel

[48:00] potatoes
[48:01] we still need to plant for life we still
[48:03] as if God was if as Jesus was coming in
[48:06] a hundred years but the brother branham
[48:08] said you need to live your life as if
[48:09] you use coming tomorrow so are we living
[48:13] our lives as if he's coming today
[48:15] tonight this tomorrow morning or we're
[48:20] just so consumed about what we need to
[48:22] do about our businesses are about a
[48:23] career about marriage about all these
[48:26] things amen you may not even get to that
[48:28] point you may not even get to that point
[48:32] I would love to see my my daughter's
[48:35] married I don't know if I'll get to that
[48:37] point but you know what I better do
[48:40] everything I can for them amen

[48:49] eat for the eternal build your treasures
[48:52] put your treasures in heaven amen put
[48:54] your treasures in heaven Jesus say amen
[48:58] look what brother Branham says you're
[49:00] going back to this secret place now
[49:02] Jesus told us to enter into our closet
[49:05] and when thou has shut the door pray to
[49:08] thy father which is in secret again
[49:11] there's the shutting of the door there's
[49:13] the shutting in amen but the brown says
[49:16] here in this in this message he says
[49:18] let's just go down to the area down here
[49:21] and it says go up a little bit okay and
[49:26] it left me and around and it went right
[49:32] down over the top of that of that
[49:34] audience and went and stood over the top
[49:37] of that little building and then settled
[49:39] down on top of it
[49:40] and this is when brother Branham was
[49:42] having the vision about that little that
[49:43] little room that little room where the
[49:46] people were going in sick and they were
[49:49] coming out healed and then when it did
[49:52] this one that was standing
[49:54] by me but behind me the same voice the
[49:57] Angels voice he said I'll meet you in
[49:59] there and this is the third pool but
[50:02] nobody will know nothing about it
[50:05] and I personally believe that that third
[50:08] pool is the opening of the word in the
[50:10] side in you and I Saints amen and I said
[50:14] well I don't understand why in there why
[50:17] there you know why not in the church
[50:20] well why not ending in in Rome why not
[50:24] in Jeffersonville why not in Arizona huh
[50:27] he said it will not be a public show
[50:30] this time hey man hey God God's not
[50:34] interested in in public shows God not
[50:37] interested in in clowning around for the
[50:39] devil like brother Browne said when
[50:41] Jesus was being tempted by Satan and I
[50:43] said I don't understand going into that
[50:44] closet like that and he said is not it
[50:47] written by our Lord when thou pray us be
[50:49] not like the hypocrites who like to be
[50:52] heard before man but enter into the
[50:54] secret closet and pray to the Father who
[50:57] see if in secret and he who see it in
[50:59] secret shall reward thee openly it's
[51:01] perfectly to the scripture every time
[51:03] and I said I understand a man next ness
[51:06] scripture I mean next quote he said
[51:10] watch and this woman when she come out
[51:11] of there on the ambulance stretcher she
[51:13] was pushing the stretcher out the other
[51:15] side and she said the lady asked her
[51:17] with the said what happened she said I
[51:20] don't know it just happened she said
[51:21] I've been in this stretcher said I've
[51:23] been down in bed for years and Here Come
[51:25] the man out packing his crutches and
[51:28] they asked him what said he didn't know
[51:30] and he was coming to the platform to
[51:31] testify and I said I don't understand
[51:33] that in there see brother Branham didn't
[51:35] understand that in there he didn't
[51:37] understand the division and watch watch
[51:41] what he says and watch he's always
[51:42] scriptural he said they're not our Lord
[51:44] say when they'll praise beam I like the
[51:46] hypocrites they'd like to make a show
[51:47] said enter into the secret closet and
[51:49] when you've done so close the door then
[51:51] pray to your father and what see if in
[51:53] secret in he see if in secret shall
[51:56] reward thee openly and he said you
[51:58] remember that name that you were hunting
[52:00] that time that you dreamed about and I
[52:03] said yes he said I'll meet you in there
[52:06] this time it won't be a public show and
[52:08] the vision left me now what's
[52:10] interesting that he tells him to
[52:11] remember that name that you were hunting
[52:13] that time next next quote god only has
[52:19] one meeting place he said over there in
[52:22] the book of Exodus that I have chosen
[52:23] the place to put my name and that's the
[52:26] only place that I'll meet people and he
[52:27] has chose a place to put his name and
[52:31] where he puts his name that's where he
[52:34] met Israel he has got a place that he
[52:37] meets his church today and he chose that
[52:40] name and that name is Jesus Christ and
[52:45] there is where he meets the true
[52:47] believer when he is in Jesus Christ
[52:51] that's where God chose to put his name
[52:53] you say God's name he said I came in my
[52:57] father's name so that's where God put
[52:59] his name was in Christ and in Christ is
[53:02] where we can all meet under the shed
[53:04] blood and there have real true
[53:06] Fellowship amen and I like what brother
[53:09] Dale said this morning you know about
[53:11] about I forgot the thought now towards
[53:15] the end he said something regarding the
[53:18] us that that uh yeah forget that I
[53:23] forgot now anyways but that Christ being
[53:28] the firstfruits amen and yes brother
[53:31] Brandon was the first was was the way
[53:32] she fame and Wade in this hour a member
[53:35] that needs to also be applied to a many
[53:38] member bribe as well they meant Amen
[53:40] because it's the same Christ amen well
[53:43] we we are under that same name as well
[53:45] amen
[53:46] praise God it's in Christ where we can
[53:49] all meet under the shed blood and there
[53:51] have true real fellowship and I don't
[53:54] know if there's a there's one more here
[53:56] or not
[53:56] praise God God's chosen place of worship
[54:01] my friends I don't want to hurt feelings
[54:03] but I am responsible for a message and
[54:05] that message has come out of this mess
[54:08] and if I ask you to come out where am I
[54:11] going to take you to would I take you to
[54:13] the Branum Tabernacle it's as much fault
[54:16] as any of the rest of them so it's not a
[54:19] physical
[54:20] building it's not in a physical location
[54:22] and it's not an amen it's in Christ they
[54:25] men that's in Christ but there's one
[54:28] place I can take you to where you're
[54:30] safe and protected from death that's in
[54:33] Jesus Christ God's place of worship
[54:36] that's the place I'm introducing to you
[54:38] tonight
[54:39] where God put his name where he promised
[54:42] he would meet every person that come in
[54:45] there he would worship with him and
[54:47] feast with him that's in Christ not in
[54:50] no church no Tabernacle amen so it it
[54:56] God is not doing this again he kept
[54:59] reiterating it's not a public show he
[55:01] kept reiterating it's a secret thing
[55:03] amen
[55:05] and and I believe that is spiritual in
[55:07] this hour because right now this walk
[55:11] with God is between you and God amen
[55:14] it's between you and God it's not
[55:17] between me and brother Dale although
[55:18] brother Dale they meant he be how can be
[55:22] uh he can uh what's the word I'm looking
[55:25] for my mind escapes me yeah he can he
[55:31] can forget the word anyways we can all
[55:36] we can all receive from one another in
[55:40] other words you see but it's it's a
[55:43] relationship between you and God right
[55:46] it's between your god it's it's not
[55:48] between me and Zach and it's not between
[55:50] me and brother Tony it's between you and
[55:52] God and thus our Amen it's in that
[55:55] secret place Amen shut in with God now
[55:59] it's not even it's not even necessarily
[56:01] in your closet door at your house
[56:05] although Jesus said that's where you
[56:07] should pray in a secret place it's not
[56:10] necessarily that Amen it's wherever you
[56:14] hold that name of Christ on high Amen
[56:17] that's where you can meet Christ amen
[56:20] and this hour and I believe it can be
[56:22] anywhere praise the Lord I believe it
[56:27] can be wherever God has pushed you you
[56:29] know proverbs 18:10 says the name of the
[56:31] Lord is a strong tower
[56:34] the righteous runneth into it and are
[56:36] safe amen so great things are in store
[56:41] for the bride in this our Saints you
[56:45] know and like I said a resurrection is
[56:47] coming I want to finish here with these
[56:49] last three verses here the brothers can
[56:52] can bring back Isaiah chapter 26 again
[56:56] and we'll start at verse 19 and we'll
[56:58] finish with this amen Isaiah or we'll
[57:03] start at verse 17 sorry Isaiah 26 like
[57:09] like as a woman with child that draw
[57:11] with near the time of her delivery is in
[57:14] pain and cries out in her pangs so have
[57:18] we been in the sight of Lord Amen I hope
[57:22] that that's that's that's how you are
[57:25] within you amen
[57:26] every day of your life amen should be a
[57:29] revival for you you know we just came
[57:31] out brother Wade preaching a serious on
[57:33] the revival Amen it's a it's a personal
[57:35] thing it's a thing that like I said
[57:38] between you and God in this hour Amen
[57:41] it's a secret thing that the world will
[57:43] not know anything about but it's so
[57:45] powerful that it's gonna resurrect the
[57:47] dead it's so powerful that it's going to
[57:50] take us in a rapture it's so powerful
[57:52] that's going to give us amen to fulfill
[57:55] and to and to show forth everything that
[57:58] needs to be manifested in order for us
[58:00] to fulfill his word because God has done
[58:03] his part now he's entrusted for us to do
[58:06] our part amen and we can only do it only
[58:13] through the Holy Spirit only through
[58:15] only through his through his power it's
[58:17] not your power it's not it's not it's
[58:19] not my power but it's God's power in
[58:22] this hour amen the power of the Holy
[58:24] Ghost in this hour and it's not the wind
[58:27] and it's not the the rain and it's not
[58:30] the Thunder Bay man but it's something
[58:31] secret that I don't even hear you don't
[58:35] even hear but God doing something
[58:37] powerful in our lives like as a woman
[58:40] with child that draws near the time of
[58:41] her delivery is in pain and cries out in
[58:44] her pangs so have we been in the sight
[58:46] of the Lord we should be with child
[58:47] right now get ready to be delivered to
[58:50] deliver we should be in other words
[58:53] that's talking about pregnancy a woman
[58:55] pregnant we should be pregnant with
[58:58] Christ amen
[58:59] get ready to deliver amen in this hour
[59:01] and it's painful I've never been through
[59:04] it but I've seen my wife go through it
[59:07] and I know it's not fun cuz I saw her
[59:10] and I helped her and and and it's not
[59:14] fun don't worry there were other other
[59:18] nurses and stuff around at the same time
[59:19] I wasn't just there by myself but verse
[59:25] 18 says we have been with child we have
[59:28] been in pain we have as it were brought
[59:31] forth wind we have not robbed any
[59:32] deliverance in the earth neither have
[59:35] the inhabitants of the world fallen you

[59:53] really get sad yes it's sad and I
[59:57] understand especially their a family
[59:59] member but but if they were if they were
[1:00:01] if they were in Christ amen that to me
[1:00:04] is brings a joy inside of me amen and I
[1:00:07] feel excited and it's almost like an
[1:00:09] envious I want to be in that place to
[1:00:11] not have to go through through these
[1:00:13] things that are taking place in this
[1:00:15] hour and not be under that Amen but you
[1:00:18] know what Saints again God has you and I
[1:00:21] here in this hour Amen because brother
[1:00:24] dick had fulfilled his part now it's you
[1:00:27] and I turn to fulfill our part amen
[1:00:32] verse 19 die dead man shall live
[1:00:36] together with my dead body shall they
[1:00:39] arise
[1:00:40] amen awake and sing ye that dwell in
[1:00:43] dust for that I do is as the dew of
[1:00:46] herbs and the earth shall cast out the
[1:00:48] dead the earth there's gonna point kind
[1:00:51] of point on where that's gonna be
[1:00:52] fulfilled amen that's gonna be fulfilled
[1:00:57] Christ resurrection
[1:00:59] a man is the pledge and the
[1:01:01] earnest of the dead in Christ amen
[1:01:04] Christ's resurrection is that is that is
[1:01:07] that earnest that God has given the dead
[1:01:09] that have come that have also died in
[1:01:12] Christ because he lives but they also
[1:01:15] will live amen
[1:01:17] praise God now now because we have that
[1:01:22] promise verse 19 we have that promise
[1:01:24] that the dead shall live and then verse
[1:01:27] 20 says in 2 so come my people enter
[1:01:29] thou into thy chambers and shut thy
[1:01:33] doors about thee hide thyself as it were
[1:01:37] for a little moment until the
[1:01:39] indignation be over past because we have
[1:01:43] these promises amen it's time for us to
[1:01:45] shut ourselves in with God with these
[1:01:48] promises with that word the promise that
[1:01:50] he said he's gonna come and come back
[1:01:52] for us amen and for us to meet him in
[1:01:55] the air praise God for behold the Lord
[1:01:59] cometh out of his place to punish the
[1:02:02] inhabitants of the earth for their
[1:02:03] iniquity and we know that's going to
[1:02:05] happen all the kings and all the rulers
[1:02:08] and all the people that think that
[1:02:10] they're in charge don't know that God's
[1:02:14] somebody's somebody's in charge there
[1:02:18] they're gonna be punished they think
[1:02:19] they're in control God's the one who's
[1:02:21] ultimately in control the inhabitants
[1:02:25] they will punish the inhabitants of the
[1:02:26] earth for their iniquity the earth also
[1:02:29] shall disclose her blood and shall no
[1:02:32] more cover her slain there's no way
[1:02:35] sayings that when you when they're
[1:02:37] powerful people in this hour with Christ
[1:02:39] in you to prevent Paul said to prevent
[1:02:42] from those resurrecting out of the
[1:02:44] ground or those coming out coming uh
[1:02:47] coming back the dead in Christ rising
[1:02:49] amen there there's no way for us to
[1:02:52] hinder that I meant that that leads to
[1:02:54] that Amen when we are shut in and died
[1:02:57] amen I hope you all understood my
[1:03:01] thought
[1:03:02] amen sometimes you know you get these
[1:03:04] thoughts in your head and there's you

[1:03:42] may not see it but it's gonna be between
[1:03:47] you and God
