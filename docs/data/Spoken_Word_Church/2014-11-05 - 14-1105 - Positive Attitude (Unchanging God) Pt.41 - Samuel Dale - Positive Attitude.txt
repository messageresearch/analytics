I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart let your desire pour out your power and love as we sing ing in love out of your glory pour out your power and love as we change I want to see you you amen and amen if that's your desire you make a way to see you good to see everybody in the house or the Lord if you'd like sure Stern to Malachi 3 and then we'll go to Hebrews 13 Malachi 3 Hebrews 13. remember all of the announcements I know you have prayed about these but uh Sister Sarah said her father brother Hermann Garland has a herniated disc in his spine and severe spinal canal is narrowing causing a lot of problems for him walking so remember that for brother brother Hermann gollard and I know you've already prayed but remember the different ones that are sick remember brother dick and and for Abby and for Deanna and sister Gabriel called and said she was having a severe headache remember these you know the different ones and and all and also remember there is we would make the announcements of the ministers meeting coming up this Saturday if you're going with Wade to brother altice to The Minister's meeting make sure and let him know all right then fellowship meeting coming up third Saturday at brother Tony's on December the 14th will be our Thanksgiving Christmas time together remember watch night will be brother William borla one will be with us ministering the Lord willing and brother Samuel Reyes up in Gainesville he's announcing he's meeting that he's having in which is uh this month uh November the 28th through the 30th he's inviting us all to come and be with him there in the the services and also just remember these we always miss announcements anything else what Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace your love your understanding thank you for all things and we just Praise Your Great Name truly Lord You Are God and you change not so we can depend upon that Lord Just Have Your Way let your loving grace be with each one of us remember the sick ones Among Us those that are not here tonight viewing by internet we pray that you were just the same presence that would be here as we Minister your word would be there with them and that could reach down and touch them and deliver each one we love you and we thank you this guiding direct each one of us and guide us especially tonight in what to be and said and let your love and understanding be with us forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness in Jesus name amen Malachi 3 will start with verse 2. but who may abide today of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth now remember we're down here in the end in the coming and appearing being two different things but he's appearing now so we ought to at least be able to relate to that all right and it says and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a Refiner's Fire and like Fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier silver he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years I will come nearer to you to judgment and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the Widow and the fatherless and that turn aside to stranger from his right and fear it not me saith the Lord of hosts now once for I am the Lord I change not now watch therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed now he's just not saying that I'm I'm God and I change not you know he puts it to them fact that if he changed they'd be consumed so you ought to remember that to all of us if he don't keep his word what good is it right if he changes what good is it right all right Hebrews 13 7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith father considering the end of their conversation now once we read Hebrews 13 8 but we don't do number seven to go with it see whose Faith father considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now you'd say well brother Dale I wrote this down where I'd remember it do you think your conversation that means manner of conversation that means manner of life in other words everything involved Doctrine uh living uh talking you know and all uh do you think that what you do try to do and preach or whatever is the same as the Bible says in Hebrews 13 8. I'm trying I'm trying very very very hard to be just that and to be that sure of the word of God that's that's the way I stand that's what I've always stood for amen I've always tried to believe this message as being something personal to you and I to not just be a Doctrine an idea or a concept or or some doings I've always believed it to try to bring us closer to Jesus Christ than ever and I've made myself clear about even today when they're trying to say brother random was wrong here and wrong darn this that and the other well there's one thing about it this message has led me to Jesus Christ so thy glory in that you know of what has been brought to me and then I'm not worried about the other parts I just you know we this is no new thing we've been there and I told you about it see that back in the 70s they come up with a lot of different things well back then you had a lot of the old people of the message a lot of the church people of the message were staunch enough to look at this young generation of peoples and and the people and tell them say just shut up we don't care nothing about talking about it he's led us to Christ we see now it's not dark so now they're just running wild about the message we're trying to show what this is and that is I told Brother Ernie the other day we were talking about that one what is it um the sign I believe the sign I said I'd at least take that believe off you know I mean I he said well I've thought about contact or something like that they ought to take that off because I believe the truth of the hour and I believe if he is has or ever will be God he's the same now we change right we are human beings we change but yet God's word don't change but now God by his word not changing our conversation should never change right you know I mean are they going to come along now and talk you out of what you believe you know are they going to deprogram you you know and try to get out of you what you believe would you be able to see so what are we doing that's what I've tried my best to be plain to you and tried to speak about a positive attitude because I'm telling you right now you me every one of us you me every one of us will fall for Satan's lie if we don't have a personal revelation a positive revelation a positive attitude about God's word oh no we never will well you want to take the rest of the night and start naming just click on that catch the sign things and just see how many of these preachers that got up and preached it they'd never turn against this message well you know somebody ordered to speak to him and tell them that you're a bunch of liars and somebody got you out with a hamburger or a hot dog one because they got you away from the truth all right but see then that's just you know but that's not nothing to do with you and I no amen that's true what everybody does has nothing to do with you and I it's a personal experience with Jesus Christ it's got to be that way see it's got to be something real all right now do you think I I still want to stay on Hebrews 13 8. for a little bit then we'll go into the thought for tonight of how that God does not change because I believe that relates to that but but do you believe that you know you could you could go out and you could ask um anybody religious any religious form and say do you believe Hebrews 13 8 has to be the word of God now how many people would you think outside of the Freaks and Fanatics and idiots you know how many do you think would say no I don't believe that that said I swear by that that's just as much as John 3 16. but said then you see you then you would try to say well explain it to me well in their explaining to you what they think of Hebrews 13 8. uh look what's come up in the message Two Souls Two Lords seven Thunder versus Etc et cetera et cetera et cetera River Jordans all kind of doctrines do they believe Hebrews 13 8 I say no but who are you I'm me who are you solve a problem I say what I believe you ought to be able to say what you believe now but my point is people would try and watch it because that's what I was trying to get across the last time we're speaking on Hebrews 13 8. that see people's actions and reactions will determine whether or not they really believe Hebrews 13 8 to be right yours mine all of our actions and reactions you know will prove whether we rarely Believe It or Not amen and remember now if we can show that he's not the same do you realize what people are doing with that if you can show that he's not the same then the rest of God's word is incorrect also because you wouldn't know what to believe you know right all right see then watch the actions and reactions or watch people trying to explain and as they try to explain see you'll see that they are not believing him to be the signing yes but he just don't do today like he used to do you don't believe he's Hebrews 13 9. explain I mean come on well it only was only 12 Apostles is that a great church teaching me nobody else got the Holy Ghost for Tim 12. well we're quick to say that's wrong and to use the rest of the scriptures to back it up to show that that's an incorrect statement but then we come over to the day and we say but he don't heal like he used to she will say that well brother Branham had great signs and wonders but we're we don't see that no more well then God changed somewhere I'm honest now you you get upset with me do what you want to about the way I State thing I just try to tell the truth to you because I'm trying to save your soul and mine too if you think that God is not the same today as he was when the prophet was here now I've explained that over and over we're not looking for no one person Ministry no sir Ray but the ministry of Jesus Christ is around the world in a many-membered body or else you're saying God changed see we're quick to explain that in the days of Luther they didn't have the great things that they had on the day of Pentecost that might be true but you know it was the cause of it was the people of the day all right did that change God come on that's all the simple I was trying to explain did that change God you remember how we were dealing with with and we'll get to some quotes here in a minute about it about positive you know partial to perfect realizations brother Brandon would use negative to positive but just remember brother random is negative is a very positive because there's no such thing in God as a negative we want to come up and say well and try to justify and say well really it's supposed to be partial realization to perfect why you don't have to explain it you don't have to explain it because to me negative we've got an electricians sitting right back there you know that negative is more positive than all your positives you think it ain't right pull it off your electric lights all the things won't work without the negative but that negative is a very positive outfit you understand what I was trying to get at see even in Luther's day yes they were not the great signs and wonders may be following but that didn't change God he was positive then he's always been positive he's never been negative there's no negative to it you're not correcting brother Branham was right it goes from negative to positive amen amen but just remember the most negative of negative of negative of God is a very very positive of all positives right right see that's all I've tried to explain see another way I believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is around the world in the bride of Christ foreign artists don't see it then you're saying God is wrong then you're saying God changed his mind somewhere you can't quote Hebrews 13 8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever you can't say that so the rest of your Bible is wrong see why it relates to that it doesn't say his manner of conversation about uh this or that or the other or what it says his manner of conversation and said you check it out to see whether it's Hebrews 13 8. because see there can't be any negativism but remember now my point y'all keep making it the most negative point that you could ever find in God would be is part more powerful and positive than all of the things that we can think about then why would we let things you know into our minds of people to make doubt coming along well he just don't do today like he used to do I want you to do it safe as far as I'm concerned as far as I see it now you gotta hope but if you're saying that he doesn't do it then you're saying God's wrong yes but I've just never seen anything outside of brother Brown's meat amen that was God's Gift in place and doing right more in one service than Jesus in the whole or even more in one service I'll say it for a long self then all of the things in the book of Acts of the accounts or the healings and the signs and wonders and read around them in one service it would be more signs and wonders than that all right all right so now you're back to what used to be said years ago said all God was he poured into Christ oh Christ was born in brother Branham he died and took it with him and we ain't got nothing but you see that's not the damaging part it's not the damaging part of the people who are related back to thinking about brother Branham and the ministry and the signs and expecting him to come back and the things that their way that's not no damage in effect the damaging effect is you and I where Satan can enter our minds and try to talk to us about God's word that's that's why I'm sorry I know that I've always been strong and hard about things because to me there's no gray area in God there's no small amount of God the smallest amount of God is the greatest of anything that we could think of all right but you see we let those things enter our mind and that's what's killing us remember back a few weeks ago a few months ago or something and I was preaching about death and what it was and to death to be our interpretation of God's word which is contrary to the truth our thoughts we're not brother Dale don't you think that that that that brother has a right to believe what he wants to believe yeah I sure do goats couldn't believe all they won't do sheep can't do it sheep can only follow God's word but you see there's nothing negative it can't be anything negative well there you're straight now brother random I ain't straighten it out I'm saying what he says so let's read what he says okay sister said the other day he said somebody said brother Dale said he said something and said I'm sitting there saying my friend didn't say it said he posted up on the screen let me read it well all right look what he said on Abraham preached in 1956 1208 e14 which is the number one on the notes let's just think about it all right showing Abraham's election God calls Man by election for knowledge no man can come to me except my father draws him first all that comes I'll give them eternal life and raise him up at the last days that settles him I'm so happy to know this one thing friend that Christian Christianity has no negative nothing to it then come back to this right look now Christianity has no negative nothing to it it's everything absolutely positive a man that becomes a child of God has a positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has a positive hold on him with the Assurance by almighty God by an oath to himself that he will raise him up in the last days to take him to Glory there's not no if or and or nothing it's something that's positive all right look at the next one here he him verse 56 12 15. 11. you talking about my stripes chastisement of our peace look what he said everything is in past tense by stripes on heal you know everything's in past tense it's done done we'll read that when we get them down all right there's no negative at all in Christianity it's all positive done paid for it's finished amen that make method is almost Shout again wouldn't it think of it it's all completed all finished our only thought is not many things God cannot do nothing else it's already completed Christ stood right here what's now Christ stood right here tonight and you'd say Christ heal me what would he say I've already done it you could cry Satan what did he say already done it all right so then where would we have the right to come up in any way to think about right well I'll tell you what I thought don't you think I got her no if you're a Christian you don't have a right to think well you're just trying to make us think what you think well am I wrong that's all I say is what I say it so far right amen amen that there's no negativism in God there's nothing negative amen that the greatest negative you could think of in Christianity is the greatest positive than all satan could ever come up with amen you remember this one I love this quote go ahead with number three proving his word in 64. now if you belong to a church that don't believe he's the same yesterday today and forever the same in every way get away from it you see one and I've got to believe the positive of all positives and try to teach the positive of all positives and the basis when I've tried my best to explain ever Doctrine ever thought ever thing that brought a random preached through the serpent seed the Daniel 70 weeks the CEOs the marriage in divorce the predestinated seeds you know predestination for knowledge all right why because at least I want you to know what I believe then if you think it's not right according to Hebrews 13 8 you you you're supposed to go somewhere else that's as good as I can say it I mean I don't want to run nobody off never have but if the truth runs you off what do I need to say my brother colleague's been here since 1971 right at your life you mean if there's something I could say to him that would cause him to leave you know well why don't you tell me what it is and I'll say it you get it save us all a lot of trouble just come and tell me to say it because how can you do it if what I preach can't let you know what I am and what I believe at least you don't have to worry about what I believe you know what I believe because I tell you right or wrong good or bad look at the next one blind Bartimaeus now the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever right and he's got to be the same in principle the same in power oh he don't have as much power today as he used to have why because people don't believe he's got the power he used to have right he's got to be the same in principle he's got to say the same in power the same in every way only the Corporal body and he's using us he doesn't need a Corporal body he's using us it didn't change the Hebrews 13 8 for him to leave in a bodily form and come back in a bodily form in a bride that made Hebrews 13 8 correct see Jesus don't have any hands but yours and mine see we are the what he's Divine we're the branches is that right Divine don't bear fruit the branches bear fruit is that right you don't take the fruit off the vine you take it off the branch but what about it do you believe it look at the next one the mighty conqueror e61 . and this this Bible said that he has risen from the dead that he is the same yesterday today and forever then he's got to be the same in Resurrection he's got to be the same in power you've got to be the same in principle he's got to be the same in every way except a cardinal body now what was that interpretation of cardinal the other day I kept looking up trying to find out why he would use the word cardinal and I'll go ahead and of most important that's what the Cardinal part means of most important you say well he just well maybe he did but he used it two or three times so that's all right but it's of most importance in every way except a most important way of a body this body the Corporal body of of his is sitting at the right hand of God Almighty and Glory do you believe that he's sitting at the right hand of God Almighty and Glory make an intercession think about it now remember this one go ahead sir as we would see Jesus 61. 409 e22 and then if Hebrews 13 8 said it is the same yesterday today and forever then he's got to be the same in Principle as I'm in power to sign in every way that he was yesterday or he isn't the same someone say he's the same in a certain way no he's the same the scripture says that he's the same that was is today and will be forever but he's just in a certain way no well he he don't heal like he used to he don't save like he used to I know I won't get through in time to do it so I'll probably after a while just quit and ask you one question and I want you to be thinking on it how many of you have been healed well I preach in this 41 sermons there's enough hands of Life the rest of the night and yet you don't believe he's the same if brother Branham was just here we could hear from God that's a gift but remember he says my gift quote will not heal you my gift cannot save you that's what he said he said it's your faith in God so what do you think about it no see someone said he's the same in a certain way look at the next one Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever number seven it's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever the same same in power same in manifestations the same in every way that he was then he is now are the scriptures wrong okay blessed be his name or the scripture is wrong look at the next one sir we would see Jesus 1961. Jesus said wherever two or three are gathered in my name they're all be in the midst and then that has to bring him in our presence now see we could stop and explain each one of these and spend a night on it then if he is here the invisible Christ okay then why can we not see him like those Greeks wanted to see him verse the same in every way except the Cardinal body Corporal body rather he's the same Christ all right well now like I said a moment ago he was great in this age but not great in that one there is a whole message in the church ages that declares him to be the same in every age so now you're going to argue with him about it not me no so let's just read two or three of these and then we'll get to the point all right go ahead with number nine Christ is the mystery of God reveal look what he said what makes it what was it making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same works that Jesus did Paul did the same and they seen God the great father that had demonstrated in the burning bush had demonstrated it to Paul and here he was being demonstrated well now Paul is not not Paul's not God the God Was the Same right come on and he's the same in every age God's threefold minor yesterday today and forever what Redeemer in his church preeminence in his coming King and then going on from perfect from there same in every age is a man here or turn on the lights 19 number 10. 1964 turn on the lights paragraph 61-62 a man is known by his credentials the credentials of the word of God if he is sent by the word of God and with the word of God same in every age it's always been you know but I just can't see it back on Luther and Western him and there's trinitarians I know that I'm the one that told you those are you know I'm quick to say those things but the God's the same people are not the same but to God's Society that's all I'm trying to explain see we can't live by yesterday's light yesterday's lightest history we know nothing about it but just remember yesterday the light to us is a foundation for what we believe in now right come on we know nothing about it you can't get warm today by the Sun that shines yesterday that's what's the matter with the churches today that what's the matter with the people they're trying to live by what happened yesterday you can't warm by painted fire certainly not it has no heat to it huh look at the next one a trial 1964. number 11. how can you people say that the apostolic age ceased where did you get it how can you people say that he's not the same in every age but you know there's people that are around the world teaching that now here's my main point okay if he's not the same in every way that he ever was now right now then what all I've read to you which showed it you know something's wrong with us but you see I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever I've taught it I believe it I believe the same God that stood before the foundation of the world as the great eternal condescended into the word the same God and says let thy be in that same God come on down to the Bible and stood on Earth and that same God wrote around and said that walked the shores of Galilee is here tonight then what about it how can a Vine come out and bear today can go out and burn orange or this day by our pumpkin it would have to change his life and in Malachi the third chapter God says I am God and I change not what he was then he is today and he always was and always will be taking it to Malachi 3. that I'm God and I change not what he was then he is today and he always was and always will be now the reason God does not work in ages and things is very simple it's exactly like it was when Jesus was here on Earth you remember he went in to pray for a little girl you know what he done he run everybody out you remember that you run everybody out you know that he came into a city God himself came into a city I'm quoting scripture and he left that City because they would not receive it he could not do great wonders in that City because of their unbelief but did that change him come on be sensible the same God walked in the city same God walked out of the city right it's not in your fault because God can't work he's waiting on somebody I was looking at them today and just run off a bunch of them he's waiting on somebody to call him on the scene he waiting on somebody to wake him up and you know what you don't have to haul and scream to wake him up you know how easy it is to wake God up you don't have to call him on the phone you know how to holler and scream you don't have to shout Glory Hallelujah all that's well and good all you got to do is believe what he said just believe what he's saying well I I believe it all but a certain why is the people of this message got tape services and things like that because they say they want it straight from the prophet well you know what I've always been blunt and don't mind saying that if I had to put up with what most of these church people has to put up with under their pastors I'd go to a tape service or probably just stay at home and play the tapes no problem because you see I want somebody to tell me about the Jesus in their life and you know how I checked out to see where it's right or Not by the Jesus in my life everybody remember that statement how do I check a Doctrine to so two Lords River Jordans except how do I check doctrines by my new birth well who are you I'm me who are you all right that doesn't impress me that's what people want to do they want to blow and blow it doesn't impress me I just go right on down the road believe in what I believe he said I'm God and I changed not and remember what we read there if not the sons of Jacob would be consumed do you realize folks what that means that if you in any way can show that God changed anywhere then there is no God I don't give a hoot what you think you show me where he's changed anywhere and we'll all go home and sit down and forget it because we might as well because there is no God you just don't understand brother Dale my God changed where'd he change come on I'm sorry don't worry about it I'm not invited to go preach nowhere and I'm to the place now that I just turned it down anyway why because I've already seen you can't convert people you can't convert people there's no way to convert anybody if you do you get them in with a hot dog you get them out the hamburger you can convert them to a doctor and somebody else can convert them to their Doctrine that's why I'm just happy to stay at home and try my best to help those that would listen to it look what he says on number 12 go ahead this is taken from the unchangeable God working in an unexpectable way we find that out that the church has changed and the people changes the road changes the scene changes the politics changes but there's one thing that does not change that's God he Remains the Same I am God and I change not no matter how long it is God has never changed one bit and he cannot change what a place the reason he cannot change is because he is infinite anything that's infinite cannot change anything that's infinite can change now are we back to some statements that he made he said God if God healed the first person he said anybody else ever reached that place they're going to have to be healed you know the first person that he healed was not a born-again Christian is in the Old Testament he said the first person that was saved if anybody ever reaches that same place he said God's obligated to save him we talk about the great Seed of Abraham what was the great Seed of Abraham a man that when God spoke to him he believed him he believed him get up get out of here you had a good living a good family a good everything was perfect where you want me to go wouldn't that be something would it be something for you to you to go to you daddy-in-law because that would have been it would have been the other I mean or your daddy or your family and you say I'm leaving well where are you going I don't know well how long it's going to take to get it I don't know well how come you're going because God told me well who's this God I don't know you ever met him no you ever seen him no come on I wish I could spend about a year on Abraham preaching man a man without the new birth believing God and he simply walks out with him has he ever spoke to you what about it go to number 13 Hebrews chapter 6. now if if we'll get down and be real sincere and really come for one purpose that's to learn I want to learn too the Bible is written said it's the scriptures are of no private interpretation that means the scripture must interpret scripture see each scripture must interpret the other all the way through the Bible to make it one great thing because God can't change because these he's the unchangeable god right go with the next God identifying himself by his characteristics there's characteristics never fails it always is the same and remember His characteristics the characteristics of God cannot fail if it does then God has failed and the Bible said in Hebrews 13 8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever therefore he is the unchangeable god whatever character he was at the beginning he's still that same character now stop there to point out where brother Brown said one time he said I used to think that Jesus loved me and God hated me you remember that one he said I found out one day they were the self-sane person right every way he worked anytime he ever done anything he does this the same way every time if he doesn't it's his character has changed me and his characteristics would display something that wasn't of God see so we wouldn't know her Revelations chapter 4. number 15. it must be the whole Bible not just part of it because God don't change what he was in Genesis he is today and what he was in the middle age he's always the same see now in Genesis when there are these cherubims that's how I come to find them I had to go back and to find out what they was at the beginning is that simple and watch what he says here on why Christ speak 1963. now Moses gave away to that and he said his faith paralyzed the world now you remember how that goes the story of Moses he was down and out but once he stepped out there on his faith he paralyzed the world with it all right either your faith will paralyze glamor or either the glamor will paralyze your faith now you have to take one or the other and you see the Bible don't change God don't change he's the unchangeable god so then what's paralyzing her was paralyzing you and I right I think you got it enough of it let me give you the life's part drop down to number 20. and we'll take that roll up to 20. those in between are the same pointings look what he says now this is from 356 Church age book Lady of sin Church age now let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only to the false Church to repent in this verse he's talking to his elect they have some repenting to do many of his children are still in those false churches now I wish you would uh move up just a little bit in your thinking because when he says a denomination or false churches you you put that in the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian the Pentecostals uh moving on up to the brown of ice okay that's what I'm talking about okay let's move up to the brand of miles all right many of his children are still in those false churches there are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5 14 awake thou that sleep us and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light to be asleep is not to be dead these are sleeping amongst the dead that you remember Paul wanted to be raised from Out Among the dead remember these are sleeping amongst the dead they are out there in the dead denominations they're floating around with them God Cries Out wake up repent of your Folly here they are lending their influence giving their time and their money actually their life very lives to these Antichrist organizations and all the while thinking it's all right they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn toward truth yes this is the age that most needs to repent but will it will it bring back the word will it again enthrone the holy spirit in men's lives will it again Reverend Jesus as the only savior I say not for the next verse reveals just astounding and shocking truth of the clothes of this age behold I stand at the door and knock he's not out there knocking on them Church doors trying to get in that should have been out of your mind a long time ago he's knocking at our heart's door trying to get in and if he's already in there but yet we're tied up with all of this other stuff where are we at he said well what's that got to do about Hebrews 13 8. for an unchanging God because most people don't believe foreign even though they have the message they read it they they cherish it they like some people we knew of you know they played tapes 24 hours a day in their home but where can you get the truth to them right right am I arrogant sarcastic hateful Okay I accept all of that but is it the truth now will you accept that amen amen you see it's not how much we know about this message is how much of this message has been revealed to us don't you think they can have a right to believe sure billy goat oh you want to you believe what you want to that's right but if it ain't according to Hebrews 13 8 I don't care what you believe and they ride if he's not the same in every way then the Bible's wrong and you and I have been found to be fooled to try to believe something that's not right but you know what I kind of believe that down through time has proven a lot of things about the word of God to be right I believe there's 68 million that died under Catholicism for what they believed is enough proof I believe all of the early church that were killed for what they believe you know have you ever thought about what they were doing in the Dark Ages you ever thought about somebody standing there with an animal to pull them apart on each end and the priest says all you got to do is is just recant your belief and said what I mean by that is said you believe Jesus don't you yes yeah I believe him were you believing to be God don't you yeah I believe him but you don't believe the way we explain it no because it's not according to Hebrews 13 8. do you understand what I'm getting at couldn't you just call class just a little bit you think you're the only ones got the truth I'm the only one that I know of has got it bad enough put it in the internet I don't worry about it but you know what if you can't say that there's something wrong with your experience that don't exalt me that exalts Jesus Christ anybody listen if you can't say you got the truth then there's something wrong with you I'm just loud and mouth smart attic enough to put it out on the internet and say come on show me where I missed it well because if I'm believing to be the same he's the same now I believe somebody's got the truth don't you I started off by saying I believe what I believe I believe what I believe not the offline statements the things that have also something that we do silly stupid stuff I'm talking about the one true and living God I'm talking about the Daniel 70 weeks the seals a minute to you out there on the internet is your pastor preached those things well now my pastor he's afraid of that he's afraid he might get confused when you go tell the old boy he already is and tell him brother Dale said that you said would you or not be that sarcastic Why Can't We Be what's the matter with you well I don't want to hurt nobody's feelings I don't either because I have feelings too but what about the truth I thought we believe the Bible said You shall know the truth I didn't know it says we shall know part truth but you see that's why I put out what I believe but the others won't tell you what to believe they'll pity better run over here they put invade around over there and a little you know but I thought truth was true I didn't know they would put one Faith one Lord one baptism one God and father of our Lord Jesus our lord Jesus Christ I thought that was what the Bible said but you see Church that's what I said to start with how many of you have been healed in the past few months there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen no that's been healed but yet God don't work like he used to where do you get that right to say that but you think the devil don't fight boy you know oh he's up now fighting hard sitting down in the woods in the night laying in the bed and all at once Here Comes his spirit wait I didn't tell him what went on you don't know it till now here come this spirit I couldn't breathe I couldn't move I couldn't breathe it was just so but yet I was conscious enough to know that hey I'm still breathing they just stayed there that's raised up and set up Wade had to get up and go to the bathroom I took that opportunity to slide on my clothes and and I did I told him I said I've got to go to the bathroom too we came back around and I said just go ahead inside I'm going to stay out here a little while I sat there for two and a half hour with that Spirit pressing cutting off my breathing and doing but you know what I say I said Lord let's be a good place to go from if it's over with and now I'm no fear none whatsoever I would have to breathe deep to get up to be able to breathe I sat there by the fire and just prayed and you know what I called every one of your name who said Lord take care of them it still didn't tell way nothing about it next night it was different I knew better than to move around very much so I set up on the side of the bed and you know that smothering the presence wasn't there there was another presence I called all of your names again for an hour or so I said Lord there's something wrong somewhere until you take care of it when Wade got up we got up that morning I said why did something wrong I don't know what it is there's something wrong but I've prayed about it that was a time Brother Gary was having some problems I've done that many times we wondered each one of you that when you come on my mind I pray for you because you see I believe God is society I believe he's the same now as he ever was there ain't no devil in hell can secure this man but you see our first check like I did years ago when a great pain struck me down through I've told you about it down through my rectum I did like it was ripping me to pieces and I immediately jumped up out of the bed and the devil said you went against brother so and so now you got cancer and a rectum it's going to kill you I got up went in the bathroom blood came out I stood there and I said Lord you know one thing for sure I've never had no problems with that brother or anybody else you know I love people and I want to help them no fish is my time to die let it go ahead but you know that I have no troubles three months before I tell my wife anything about it because she worries about me but you see the devil can't get you until God's truly here and when he's through with you he can get you anyway it don't matter who's there right I'm saying that there's God is still here and he's the same amen that he ever was and you that were healed you just remember a lot of times it wasn't because we prayed for you he was your faith I wish I had all not to explain that it's not how good I am or what it is but if you can believe that that person that prays for you is in contact with God will come down and heal you he'll deliver because he's unchanging but just remember don't think he won't let up on you sure I went on called the doctor and said hey can you give me something for coughing I get it about every three months anyway he sends me something I'm taking pills for it that's Glory Hallelujah thank God for healing no matter how he brings it to us but I'm just saying well some of you just like to stand up and just testify a minute about what you got we'll get to get the well I guess it's over there just tell about your healing and like I said remember you don't have to be prayed for you got to believe it oh boy's got it he's born already bro Sam I'd like to say a couple of things here uh you all know that I have a lot of trouble with diabetes there ain't nothing but a devil now God's letting this bride be tested above measure sure because we got to be tested to prove to Satan that we're going to stand in Hebrew 13 8. now I don't know how to say this I'm just going to say it uh last night or yesterday started yesterday evening my sugar shot up to 300 plus well didn't do nothing to to get it but I got so beyond myself I was so bad until I I didn't hardly know if I was coming to going and what I'm saying is Hebrews 13 8 is the only thing the same God that started this thing is the same God that starts in exactly and that's Malachi 4. right I was so I was so I didn't even a Peggy couldn't even talk to me and I was where I checked my sugar at that my counter anybody been in my house they know who I do it and I was right there and and I walked around toward the front of the house and come back and come back to my study right there and and I I was I was tried on Hebrews 13 8. that's what I'm trying to say I don't I don't know I know I can't get this out but you have to stand and know that he's God when you don't see nothing you know he said it be certain of God he says when you've done everything everything and there's nothing between you and God he said then you've got to know that he's God right and that's Hebrews 13 8 exactly you got to stand there but I'd like to cherish to to remember me uh when I said a while ago that I'm already healed all the devils in hell has fought me about this for 45 years going into the four to six years but he still lost because I've got that God Amen I can take that God or God can take me back to where he put my name on the land of the book of life before the foundation of the world and that name is his attribute and and he showed me that he showed he's took me back and showed me where he put my name there he said and he also told me that that he knew the deceitfulness of Satan and what he was going to do when I got here so he went ahead and put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that holds me and that's Hebrews 13 8 right that's the word of God it's a word you we can say Jesus Christ the same yesterday forever in the day and forever but what we're saying is the word never changes right the word is God he is God he always will be God and he'll do exactly but see you can say with his stripes you're healed for 45 years and it'd be true he says no matter how much Faith you got it won't alter the predestinated will of God he's got a journey from you that's what he told me and showed me when he carried me back but back before the beginning now people I don't know how other people does I don't know that I just know my experience I know what God's done in my life and I believe the word I believe that Jesus is the same and I believe that there ain't no devil in the hell could keep his diabetes on me I don't know when God's got his own time and and and I but I believe him amen and I've been healed I've been healed praise God I am healed amen there ain't no devil in hell can preach me out of it take me out here they told me out of it it's mine God himself that in the beginning give it to me he saw me healed he'll see me he'll crippled up you don't see them bypass surgeries and aneurysms he don't see that he brought he what he's seen was he'd bring me through them all right so I'm Healed I mean I'm Healed ain't nobody take it away from you but I'll tell you you talk about I could be here a rest of the night who's next yeah who's next there's somebody that's like brother Boyd I believe then you have your hand up oh okay oh oh okay yeah Brother Gary this is a couple of weeks ago and this has happened me uh many times but I was uh I would get in these situations where I would be struggling and fighting for every breath I took and it was uh just a a terror it really terrorizes you when you're suffocating you're actually suffocating and brother they'll call me that day and and I I thought I was dying I really did because the presence of death was there and I don't know if you sensed it when you came over but it was brother Dale said I'm coming over there and he came over I was in the bed and he didn't pray well I think he did at the end you know but we sat there for about 20 minutes and we talked about the word and he just said a very quick short prayer at the end of that when he left I got up I vacuumed the house I went on my exercise walk I was totally and completely delivered to that thing but I tell you if you if you've never experienced the presence of death it's it's real and and it's I guess it's another realm that you can pick it up but I just thank God amen who's next brother Cauley I just want to say lots of times when I'm sleeping I have I was having what I thought was seeing sometimes everything I think is a heart attack yeah but uh it was turned out to be acid free floods and it was get so bad at times that if I could I choked myself to get it to go away but I kept praying and talking to the Lord and having people here at the church to pray for me too and finally it just went away but then nice I I know I told a few people that I've fallen out of bed a lot of times but you know it's just like Satan the next time you know next time I get you but the last time I fell out of bed I thought somebody threw me out of bed and come close to hitting me in the eye from from the side my ear around to my face which which is swell up really bad for a while but I know that Christ is real I know that the healing has already been taken care of so I'm not I'm not worried anymore about it whatever happens happens only thing I tried to is make sure that I believe Christ and keep him amen first and whatever happens just happens right thank you Lord for for looking out for him and taking care of them amen that's it he'll do that he'll take care of him he'll be enacted anybody I guess it was about uh two weeks ago I had to go to the kidney doctor and I went up for prayer but before I went out during the service side I kept having real bad heart pains so I took a Nitro and the doctor said it could take two you take that third one you go straight to the hospital well I took that one and it just kept on and I said I'm going up for prayer for for when I go to the kidney doctor and I said when I do it's hard problem is going to leave me and it did and I thank the Lord for that right praise the Lord amen he'll do it he'll take care of it anybody else yeah I know a lot of you told me said brother Dale I was healed well I believe it he's he's the same he he just he's wanting us to believe because when it comes down to a poetry when you're laying like I was the other night when you can't breathe you know why me wait wait up I knew what it was he could pray with me yeah but I knew try this when I turned son in I said I'll just say daylight came he come out at 5 30 started cooking breakfast he didn't even know I'd been out there all night let me tell that but the next night it was different it was one of those nights that when you know there's something wrong somewhere but I'm not a prophet so I can't tell you where it's at yeah I just believe it now just call your name and say well Lord it's somewhere or something's wrong then somebody come along later and say will this happen or that happened brother Gary was talking he said did I had a problem the other night I said was it about three in the morning he said yeah I said that enough for me because I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever all he wants us to do is believe it you know just believe him and accept it he'll take care of it anybody else before right you know one more but go ahead with yours well um I was diagnosed with that big fibroid when I was pregnant with Sarah and my doctor said we'll schedule an operation six months after delivery and I went in for my six months and thank God we didn't have to do it it shrunk and I thank God for healing me and even if it comes back again it's same devil it doesn't make a difference God still healed me because it doesn't change his word so I'm hanging on that Sarah wants to talk too yeah go ahead brother yeah I just remember through a call in 2007 I had osteomyelitis and I was leading song service one day up here on Sunday Afternoon brother Nick was out of town in the afternoon service and the pain struck me so bad I didn't know what was going on I just began to sweat really bad but I've had like four kidney stones and this is probably 10 times worse than any kidney stone I'd ever had and got through that day and then we went to the hospital and then you came with me we spent a couple of hours there and the whole time they were saying we don't know if it's cancer we don't know what it is and it it took about three days I think to figure it out and they actually had to get the CDC involved to really figure out narrow down what it was but but what it was was that osteomyelitis was that bone dying literally dying and that pain was so great that I would just literally cry out I'd work all day and cry out to God to take me that's how bad the pain was I would land the floor and just my whole family be around me I'd work all day and just cry myself to sleep crying out for God to take me and he put me in a port in my chest with both drawn blood once a week and gave me 2 500 milliliters of Vancomycin which is a drip about the biggest bag you can get I took every day for church for work I had to go to the hospital but allowed me to go sit among cancer patients in there and the O'Connor ecology lab I guess it's called and brother dick and I think brother Gary and some of them come up here and we were just brother dick bring his guitar and we'd sing and so it put me in a place other when it showed me that just people worse off than I was but what I'm saying as part of a testimony in all that I saw where my blood was drawn it was pure almost wide in the bowel because of the triglycerides and come and get prayed for and go back on the next blood draw a week later it's completely gone and I have to this day I've not had any instance where I have a backache back pain I could still carry feed sacks on each solder I have no problem with my back because God touched me and all that but he also showed me one thing and that is you got to keep your faith and you got to keep your focus on the fact that you're healed and you got to claim it right because if there's this lady at work right now told me just this week she said I went had a CAT scan and they she said something that might have thought I had a mini stroke and I said what's your confession and she says I don't think anything something happened but I don't believe it's that and she said on the next day after CAT scan she said I haven't heard anything and I said well you know no news is good news I said what are you claiming she says I don't know something happened I said I'm claiming that there's nothing there right and I asked her today I said what'd they find out she said well there was nothing there and I said that's what you've got to believe you know yeah but it's just amazing I'm telling you you can doubt you can talk yourself right into the grave exactly and that's where that's what's wrong with so many people and when they say I hope it really hurts me when somebody says I hope right you know because I stand there and correct him I said but I believe you know or you you should believe because brother Aaron did a wonderful message one time on Hope the hopes now it's not what's going to get you it's I believe in believing amen but I just thank you that he touched me but the prayers of the Saints when we all come together praying that's the key thing I don't think that we come together to each other enough to know that pray for this brother right now right we need to do more of that right because there's definitely here so you just call out people's name and I just appreciate that positive attitude that's what do we need for the board Rachel and how to say it and um I'm really um when I was uh sick three weeks ago and um I'm not normally one to get sick and so um I think what it was was well the doctor was saying it was was mastitis is with just an infection when ladies get when they're nursing their babies and stuff and so um well they said it was that but I don't know because it was the sickest I've ever ever ever felt in my life it was um just somebody touching my skin it was just it I was like I couldn't even stand and be touched and I was just I was running a fever and everything but it was the worst I've ever felt and so on that Sunday I stayed home from church and Joseph um Joseph brought I think Jonas and or Josiah to church with him and he told everybody here you know what was wrong with me why I wasn't hearing everything and um I'm going to be honest and just tell you that I didn't have the sense to really think about asking for prayer and I didn't ask Joseph and I didn't ask anybody and um and so I got better after that and about two days later I don't know if I don't think I'm saying this right but just the other day I was thinking about it and thinking about how awful I felt and how sick I was and stuff and the thought came to me and I believe it was God and he said see there I was mindful of you even when you didn't have the sense to ask prepare yourself yes and I believe that it was Joseph coming here and telling the Saints to pray for me and telling him what was wrong with me and you guys knew automatically to pray for me and I I know Joseph was probably praying for me but I never actually sat there and asked him to pray for me and so you know that's the way God healed me and that was the worst I think that's the worst I've ever felt in my life and so that that's my I don't think that came out right but it made sense in my head and Jonas wants a microphone where he can say hallelujah little filler sits back there and said Hallelujah right who'll be next suspicious I'd like to say one of the things especially for the people that's got ongoing afflictions things that's been with them for years like Brother Gary they they born with them but God is still God sure and if you can believe you know Joe they say he went for a year in all this Affliction he has and he didn't doubt God he was so bad he wanted to be hit in the ground to the Past but I can only speak for my and I'm glad I could slow down a little bit I was ready to start flying a while ago but uh God heals me every second of my life because because this thing that he has allowed to come on me has brought me to to the faith that that I have he's brought me to I that I believe him in spite of every devil there he is but every every minute every second that I live God gives it to me sure I don't mean it I feel great and all because older I get seems like the worse it gets you know but I I still maintain that God is the God of all creation right and he healed me when he put my name on the land Book of Life he sees me heal and I'm coming to it he said it is here it's here with me now because he's inside my soul but I I like to say this just one one time the people that has these things and we all you know like sister Rachel God did that for her for a purpose so that next time and Satan is going to come yes one thing you can you can kill and he's coming now worse than he's ever come and he's more deceptive now than he's ever been he's more evil than that if you could say that than he's ever been and he is trying to get us off of what you preach tonight you've got to know that he's God right and and if you don't know him by the word then I don't see how you could know him no you have to study yourself God you've got to you've got to he did something for me last Thursday night bro Sam I was in one of those States I mean I I don't mean that I was aggravated now I was I mean that he was trying to kill me and I and I went through there and and every time I checked my sugar he was higher higher and I wasn't doing anything higher and higher and higher he just goes Plum out of sight and I walked I took the familiar trip back toward the door to my garage door and done a a 180 and went back into my study and God is my witness i s I come and sat down in my chair and I sat there and I reached and I got my books to lay in there and I picked up the greatest battle ever fought and I just read just a little bit I preached on it many years and I believe it I know that it's the truth but I didn't feel satisfied I just laid it down and I picked up Abraham's Royal seed I did the same thing in in this one here but it didn't feel satisfied I I just laid it down I knew it was the truth and I picked up the reality of living realities of God the reality is of God and then when I sat down I sat there I was just sitting looking figures in the other room and a word come in my mind just it was just there and I took a recent got my Bible off my end table and reached over and and I knew the word I knew that Paul had said it but I wanted to see I couldn't remember right off because I was going through so much that I that I that I was trying to remember where I was at and I just went to the reference and I found two two scriptures and then I won't go into all that but when I read those scriptures God began to speak to him and showed me what he has had me doing to this present moment he he the the ministry that he has called me to he's he he showed me he I mean he showed me I mean I I don't know what anybody believes you believe me or not that's immaterial to me I can't help it I just have to say what you say I say what I believe and I believe God's doing he showed me that he showed me in these two scriptures he showed in all at once whatever that was that was that was pressing me down like you that had me I mean I I thought I would die I thought I was going to die and he just took it away but I but I just wanted the people to know that every second you live you're in Pearl if it wasn't for God Satan would kill you and you better praise God that you ain't got some of these afflictions and some of these people that are we are we see somebody like that right there like brother Dale said you ought to go to praying right you ought to see what the scripture says if somebody comes and prayed for and they don't get healed it ought to put the whole church into desperation we ought to see these things right I'm sorry I just I just but I'm tell I mean in my own self so I know what Brother Gary is talking about when you get up you wake up and you know that you wasn't supposed to woke up walk up your sugar so low and it don't even rest on the machine and you're struggling you're trying to get to the kitchen to get you something that would would and and you you feel like you just barely moving somebody else is carrying you yeah time after time after day out today a week after week year after year it goes on it wears you down but the God of all creation has saved my soul and he's got something laid up for me right see I mean here he he's not waiting he's given to me here and got something waiting sure amen anybody else before we go brother Ryan while he's getting back to him I just wish you would get the video and watch the Ryan's testimony I've got a picture in the office in there that says the baby that Faith brought and that's little Sarah back there that I want another picture to put in there the faith that kept a baby from being taken because I believe it I believe it go ahead that's all I was going to say is during my testimony actually I forgot to mention that that I I recognized when all that went on with Ava that uh it was during the positive attitude series that you were preaching on that and I thought well Lord this timing is perfect and as it always is his timing is perfect but he healed her and all of us many times through this series so thank the Lord amen hey man anybody else before we go we will uh we should do me one favor bow your head and close your eyes someone told me just recently in private I said brother Dale I got a problem you don't have it anymore Lord Jesus thank you for the night thank you for the people that believed Hebrews 13 8. and I believe that your God and your chains not Lord then that way we're not consumed because we got something we can believe in we just ask you to help us guide us Let Your Love be made manifest Among Us may your word take the pre Eminence in our hearts in our lives that we may be what you want us to be we love you we thank you in Jesus name let's just saying stand and saying I love him anybody have a need before we go I love you I I love you because he first loved me just mine salvation let's sing it to one another as you're leaving I love and always foreign
