TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to make ready. Father, her the bride has made herself ready. So we pray that you would just help us, Father, with these portion of the words that we'll be reading today and we'll be teaching and expounding, Father, that it would uh prepare our hearts, Father, for worship and then for the preaching of the word later this morning. We ask these things in the mighty name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. See if this thing connects right in. Two. [clears throat] Wonderful. So, this this morning we're going to be talking about seed life. you know, the life that's in the seed, how the word is a seed, typifying uh the the plant life, the botanical life, the the different uh sources of life and plant types of lives, and how God said it all from the beginning. So, you know, and the question I I want to ask ourselves is why seed? Why did life have to come by way of seed? you know in the plant life we see and animal human god's word it just think about that you know ask yourselves you know why didn't it come in another way you have rocks we have other forms of life you have different things that that are didn't come by the way of seed in in the creation but if you really group what really did come by seed it just really puts it into perspective you know why why did it have to come by seed you know why did humans have to come and reproduce by seed why seed you know so again the topic being seed life so in my study I found these types of seed there's another one I'll touch upon uh here uh throughout but most basic form and even how the Bible starts it starts off with plants starts off with botanical life you know it says let their earth yield uh grass and trees so you have plant life they have the seed of plant life and I think it's so beautiful how it says that whose seed seed is in itself and it's a reproduction and it's the original life and then you have animal life then we have human life and then you have the seed of God Christ the word &gt;&gt; but then there's the seed of discrepancy brother Brandham also toned it the seed of the serpent so see follow the seed the seed line and it's just amazing to see as we read these scriptures just put that into perspective sometimes we're talking about these different forms of of seed and it's just amazing how life had to come by a little tiny little thing by seed. And I'll do a little type and a little contrast right now with something that the closest thing man has been able to come up with and that is like a microchip, right? Something that is got artificial life or not life, intelligence, something that's got function if you will and that we use. It was man-made and it can accomplish a lot and they can make them real small. But see it's just it's it's it doesn't it falls short from the real life from the original life anything of course that we create and of course there's also where you take take a seed or plant life and you modify or you pervert it or you genetically engineer it and how it comes with limitations how it it it stops and it might not reproduce itself after the second and and so forth. So it it just let's just look about the seed. Let's let's let's talk about how precious it is that God decided to reproduce plant, animal, humans, and even the the enemy, right? Um tries to copy that and then himself, God um through through a seed in type. So living things I I I wanted to put a kids dictionary uh definition for just life or living things. So, keep it real simple is living things are I remember helping my daughter in um about two years ago in a in a school project and she was trying to define what living things were and we came up with a simple thing was just things that and the word reproduce is is big on that but things that it's organisms that can grow so like a rock right cannot grow itself uh move breathe or or take in nutrients and reproduce themselves. So, I just I like it. I think it's simple, right? It's it's something that's got to have a little bit of movement. It's got to have uh grow and it's got to be able to uh change shape [clears throat] and form and it's got to be able to reproduce but it's got to have these different factors at the same time &gt;&gt; right so I put a depiction here so you can just be clear in our mind you have the plant right that that um all grass all everything it comes from a seed everything we see all the beautiful landscapes you know housed in a mountain and a valley flowers God chose to come in the form of a seed. Then we have, you know, animal life, right? And it reproduces after its own kind. Then we have human life depicted here by a mother holding a baby, right? But then we have, you know, a new birth by the individual and depicted here by somebody reading their Bible, receiving the life of Christ. And then then we have, you know, believers sharing and and bringing forth the word in other believers, right? of course, God God doing the work. &gt;&gt; So, I just think that's that's really what what um God had an interest in the seed. You when you read the Bible, um I was astonished there was like 257 just hits just for the word seed. That's not looking into other words like offsprings or errors and other words that mean the same thing. And I was just uh amazed when I was reading how much care God takes to protect the seed and the seed line. And sometimes people were called seed themselves. And it says and and then it brought forth uh seed meaning even though it's already born but they still call him seed. So I just think it's beautiful um how God chose to bring forth life through seed on the plants on the animals on humans on a Christian a believer. And um again the enemy wants to copy that by the seed of discrepancy and the seed of serpent the serpent seed. So just taking a step back here we have uh Genesis 1:11. And the first time the word seed I found it says, "And God said, let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself." So that was the miracle of reproduction, right? That it just wouldn't stop there. It's that same seed that once was could have procreated all the orange trees we know. And to me that's powerful is is to is to have that kind of a adaptive life source where housed in a little pocket in a little in a in a little bag of a seed that is that it's lays there and it's able to bring out everything that was in it and then whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and God blessed them. So this is now the man and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply. This is a commandment that was given. This is before the u the incident had happened and replenish the earth and it says to sub subdue it right over the fish of the and the the animals of the earth and all that. And then once once it starts getting interesting is when he says in Genesis 3:15 it says and God excuse me and I God uh will put enmity between thee talking of the serpent that's the serpent the woman and between thy seed and her seed. And I'll show an example here. Of course, it's depicted as her seed because it was talking about the woman. We know is is the seed of of human. And it says uh and later on we know that brother random says that seed was Christ, right? And it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel. So just to depict here how even though it talked about the woman seed in this place and another place I found that it called it the woman conceive the seed but we know of course the seed come from comes from the male. It says, "Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, if a woman have conceived seed, see, so it's saying her seed because it was a seed that was in her at the time and born a man child, you know, and then it goes on to say that it would be unclean for seven days and so forth, days of separations in the law." So, and then there's another place where it kept on calling it the woman seed, but as we know, everywhere else in the Bible, it talks about the man men having the seed. And here we find in Genesis 4:25, "And Adam knew his wife again, and she bare a son, and called his name Seth, for God said, she the woman hath appointed me another seed." See, instead of Abel, whom Cain slew, and this is where, if you know, the distinction between the seeds started to be made known, &gt;&gt; appointed me another seed. And it says in Genesis 7:3 of fowls also of the air by sevens. This is a time of Noah and the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. So God was very careful to keep all the seed alive in in in the flood right humanly speaking the animals and as of course we know the the uh the plant life was able to sustain itself. And in here um this is an example where a promise being made for seed for Noah and then also for Abraham in the same page here. So God spake unto Noah and to his sons with him saying and I behold I established my covenant with you and with your seed after you. And to Abraham said and behold to me thou hast given no seed. He said, "And Abraham said, behold, to me, thou has given no seed, and lo, one born in my house is my heir." So, it's just amazing how the seed the seed uh the Bible talks so much about the seed in in six Genesis 16 says, "And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply that seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for the multitudes." We know that promise was also made to to Abraham. And in Exodus we find where it says and the house of Israel called the name thereof mana and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. So in the Bible it speaks a lot about seed. It speaks a lot about different plants of seed and I I didn't have time to look into all the the details of that but I just know that that mana itself right the type of the word is also here being uh um it's being typified as a seed as a coriander seed. So let's look at this illustration here. So you'll see in the on the picture there's a a seed and then there's like a a small tree or a ceiling. This is a quote from brother Brandon where it says, "Let us see God and the word is like a seed." That was from Luke. And then he's skipping. He says, "Did you know that every orange that will ever be in that tree is in it when it's just about one inch tall?" Did you know that? Sure. It is where it comes from the seed. See, now the only thing it is is just planted out, set out. And in the same message in the same the next verse it says the next quote it says and it was to and it has to draw it it sucks water from the earth and gets nourishment and when it drinks in water it pushes out limbs drinks in more water pushes out leaves drinks in more water pushes out blossom drinks in more water pushes out oranges. It just keeps drinking and pushing out and it has to drink. Just reminds me so much, right? The to encourage us, right, that once you've been born of God, right, you just have to be drinking of his life, partaking, you know, being washed by the water of the word, just continue to draw new nutrients and nourishment like the sheep, right? Where he doesn't have to worry about reproducing wool. You just have to, you know, walk this life, be connected to to him, just keep on drinking and pushing out. I just think it's beautiful that in here it says that all the many bullshos of oranges that were ever going to be was at one time in something the size of of a seed. &gt;&gt; And and to me, it's just a the mystery that all life as we know it has come with something that uh it's a seed and those forms of organisms we spoke about. In Psalm 37 says, "For the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints," that's his seed. They are preserved forever. But the seed of the wicked, it shall be cut off. I was doing a little study to find out like if you put seed and if you bury it and if it does not bring forth if if it and for the most part they don't necessarily rotten is what I read. they can actually just remain there and then you know they can bring forth life in the future. That to me that was an encouragement to know that that you know with situations with wayward ones with loved ones it's just to be patient right &gt;&gt; and and and God's word will do the work right it's like somebody said you know you don't just plant a seed and then bury it back up to see if it's it's coming alive you just got to commit it because if it's not coming in in this season it might come in in the very next one &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; Amen's word said so he said let there be light as we heard brother random in the message this morning. He spoke these things into existence. I remember a brother um retirement age and he had a in Arizona, you know, it's it's hard to grow anything in Arizona, but he had a the most luscious 2acres I've ever seen in Arizona ever. They're full of green grass, all kinds of trees, and then just he pointed out to the to the tree and he says, you know, that's that's the word of God manifested there. He said you know God spoke that let he said everything it's that verse that he says let it seed be with in itself &gt;&gt; God's word original seed he said that he literally that's God's spoken word right there manifested &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and it just really spoke to me much you know because he he had that conviction and that faith &gt;&gt; how much more are we able to say about ourselves right once we've been of course we had the human life but when we've been b born by his spirit &gt;&gt; right so I like this message quote the great warrior 55 David did if you said to me brother Brandham give me an oak tree it says you're from down in southern Indiana where they have the big white oak and so forth give me an oak tree and I'll give you an acorn well you've got a oak tree potentially it is in the seed form but it's an oak tree you've got say but but it's an oak tree you've got it in an acorn when we take God's word we got it in seed form when we can accept divine healing by God's word that settles it amen we have patience for that right brothers &gt;&gt; sometimes uh that's where we tested a lot because we we've we've been healed we experienced healing but sometimes there's that one thing that just bothers throughout life and you see healing touch and all that but it's just it settles it once you it will grow it will grow it will manifest you know and we know that there's miracles and sometimes there's a process of healing those are the ones that I think require the most faith but that settles it somewhere deep in in the same sentence the next sentence it says take the old acorn and bury in the ground and stand off there and watch her for a little while and she and see what takes takes place, your oak tree comes right up on it. Cut up comes right up with it. It says because the life is in the seed and God's word is a seed and it's alive. See, to me, it's a mystery how much how much life can be compacted in that small little um orange seed. If you can just simply receive it, take it out of the Bible and said, "It means me. By his stripes, I am healed." Right? Amen. Then you got something. See, substance faith. That's right. All the demons could not stop you from it. No matter what anybody would say, you wouldn't believe it because you know where you're standing. Isn't that amazing? When you have that true faith, that conviction. So every time we hit God's word, let's go to planning. You know, we we hear something, you say, "It's me." Plant it in that heart, meditate on it, pray on it, you know, take time outside to yourself and and have faith that it will grow and it will manifest. It is God's word. &gt;&gt; Have faith, you know, in the life, the seed life. In Psalms 126, it says, "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy." I always wonder that, you know, why why would a sewer be out there crying and and sewing and one time um this word came alive to me at the time when my father-in-law was um in the process of communicating with me and giving her daughter into marriage and it it just opened up to me. You know, there's certain things that you have to plant in your lives that are harder than others. You know, if you just got a little bit of seed from your neighbor and you're just throwing it out, you're not going to be crying. But if you have something that means is near and dear to you, that means a lot to you, it's different. I I saw this. So it says, "They that sew in tears, you know, shall reap in joy." But it doesn't mean they're not going to sew in tears. Verse six, he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, something that's really precious to you, &gt;&gt; shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheets with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. And one time I had a photo with my wife and I in Arizona went to an apple um orchard and I had my wife when she was running with with the daughter and with the son and just running and I took a photo and I put the scripture and I sent it to my father-in-law and said see that's not where you get the the rejoicing part. [laughter] Now that's the she's part you know when um you had to go through all the decision making and the process of believing God for what he was planning you know what he was surrendering and committing to to the ground to you know bring forth more to to giving up and that's just a type now but um I think about it in your life think about why why would you go sewing seed crying or weeping so there are certain things that we We do got to uh we know that later on we'll find out where it says unless a seed is planted and dies it remains alone &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but see but once it sprouts out it brings life &gt;&gt; amen so just just take that in your life you know there are certain things we know that we have to sacrifice that we had to surrender that we had to give up right and at that time you know it's it's um there's there's tears there's weep But just know that if it's um you're doing it in good faith, you know, God will God will honor your faith. In Isaiah 65, it says, "They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble, for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord." See, and their offspring with them. So just again sewing and sewing seed and knowing that it won't be in vain and that the work of the Lord all that you do does not return back to him void. &gt;&gt; It accomplishes what he sent out to to do. Acts 13:23 of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus. See, this is Paul when he was speaking about David. And you know, if you don't think that seed matters and all that, just think of genealogy. I mean, I just read in Matthew where it um it says that from Abraham to David, it was 14 generations. And from um David to Christ, it says 14 generations. Just how precise. I was looking at some of the pilgrim pilgrim um voyage uh of William Brad Ford and of Plymouth Foundation and some of that and just seeing how some of the people that were dropped into the water and were were able to get saved and all that. I'm just thinking how they became like George Washington's you know they were basically George Washington's father you know grandfather or such and so many others that have you know done something in life and just just to think how God had to watch watch your seed line your in the natural right and then in the spiritual as well but just knowing how God preserves the seed and and you you can't um you can't but help to know that it was it was a of course it was God's purpose behind it. It was designed like how can you have 14 generations from Abraham to David and promising to David, oh your seed, your seed, your seed and then all the way to David and then your seed, the root of David, uh the root of Jesse, you know, and so forth. And then how precise 14:14. So genealogy, you see that all all played out through Acts 17, it says, "For in him we live, we move." Remember one of the definitions of being alive was something that has uh it's an organism that um that grows that moves that breathe everything that has breath praise the Lord and that can reproduce. Amen. So a rock is not an example of that. A plant, animal, humans are Christians and so forth. For in him we live. So we're a living thing. We move and we have our being like we sustain our being in him. as certain also of your own poet has said, for we are also his offspring. It's just amazing to know that you're God's direct offspring once you're born again, &gt;&gt; born of his spirit. Galatians 3:16, now to Abraham and his seed. So notice there's no S in there where the promise made. He saith not and to seeds with an S meaning multiple as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? I mean to Abraham how amazing it is that he was promised that Christ will be brought about from his seed. &gt;&gt; And you know it's amazing. And it makes you wonder, you know, the miracle that happened when he was able to give him the promise when he couldn't have seed and they were both, I read, fertile. I mean, um, infertile. Both of them were. I read it in the Bible this last night. So, naturally speaking, it was impossible. So, this is some supernatural miracle seed in the natural and in the spiritual &gt;&gt; in this case. Galatians 3:29. And if you be Christ, then are the Abraham seed. And you know to me that's powerful verse because a lot of times we read you know in the Old Testament Abraham and to his seed and to his seed and to his seed and you know a lot of times we feel like we're not Jew right but here it is and if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed &gt;&gt; with no s and heirs that's seed too according to the promise. So that promise was very supernatural. is God's own word. And again, you know, being born again, it's a Bible term. First Peter 1:23, I know it gets preached a lot because that's what the basis of our faith is, but it it's being born again. It says right here, word for word, &gt;&gt; not of corruptible seed, not of the seed of discrepancy, not of the serpent seed, but of the incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. So God shows it this way. He's typifying. Just look at a plant. Just have patience. You know, there's a birth seedling germination, right? Seeing then it then it comes forth. You know, take heed what you what you plant. Um my father planted um a tree and it was kind of very small. He said, "You should have just gone with the original seed, you know, with like just go buy an one organic orange instead of he planted an orange tree instead of, you know, the one you bought at the Walmart and then you planted it." So he didn't listen. So he planted it. This is like 20 years ago or more. So he planted it and here he is. He has it. Every two, three years it gets some kind of sour something lemon orange. He knows what it is. It's I know a lot of types of oranges, but this is like I don't even know what it is. I mean I know the lemon orange, lemon, limes and all kinds of things. This is like like this is not even what you call ornamental orange. I'm talking about and sometimes like you squeeze the thing and no juice comes out. And so the only thing that's good for right now is shade. I'll give it that. I mean, my my my mom washes her clothes outside kind of old style with the with the washer. And um they love it because of the shade, but here we are 20, 30 years later and just, you know, it's it's only going to do what was in that seed. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So especially things that are longstanding in your life, let let's plant the good, you know, the good principle &gt;&gt; being born again of the seed incorrupt incorruptible. So Genesis 22, we'll wrap it up here. That in blessings I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and and and [clears throat] the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy. So seed of the promises, many promises again born again again here 1 John 3:9, whosoever is born of God does not commit sin. That means you don't have that unbelieving nature. For his seed remainth in him and he cannot sin. He cannot doubt as a day in day out from the inside of the soul out because he is born of God. First John 3:9. That's anorthy scripture. 1 John 3:9. And just here, I Jesus very clear who's speaking in Revelations have sent my angel to testify unto thee these things in the churches. So he's the one that sent the the angels to testify in the churches. I am the rude. So first person speaking and the offspring of David. You know what was said in Matthew that from the fourth generation. So that's the seed there. He said I'm the seed of David and the bride and morning star. And we know of course there's the the parable of the swer. We're not going to get into it but it says the seed is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the parable &gt;&gt; in Romans 8:17. Just a few more scriptures. And if children, then heirs, that's seed. Heirs of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him that we may also be that we may be also glorified together again. So that's that's our promise. And then u think two more scriptures. Verily, verily, I say unto you, except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it brings forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; Man, it's transformed, right? It's transformed from that seed life and it manifests what was in it and it goes forth and it has the it's alive. It can reproduce. It can move. It can grow. And it just means amazing that it can result back in the original the original life. I think this is the last quote that we have. The spoken word is the original seed. But oh God, where there's a germ of life come from the real seed that God proved it was his seed. He rose him up again. See that through that life that's going over the original seed like was given to Eve over his real church is bringing forth life again through the birth through the womb of the his bride. See? Oh, it's rich and glorious. I give it a little time to study and it it'll sink in. He's that seed. He's that seed that was produced by the word of God. Be it unto me according to thy word. There's the seed. See, taking the word. Taking the word. See? And it says seed life. God bless you, brothers.
