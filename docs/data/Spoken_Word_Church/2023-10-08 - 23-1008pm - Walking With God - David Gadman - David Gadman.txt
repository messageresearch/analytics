background this song we've been probably trying to sing this like almost a year now and um every time I put it off sister Monica be like um I'll give you your R now um I didn't realize that she could have played piano until one day we was going through the song cuz originally Zoe was supposed to play and she's like well I've been working with her I was like you can play the piano I was like come on girl let's do this and she could you turn it red and um so since then we've been trying to practice the song and um sister Monica has done really good practicing with me and I play pray that this song is a blessing to your soul this evening [Music] maybe you never walked a day in sin and you never had to lift you from a life so black that light couldn't enter in maybe he never came at night to dry your eyes so swollen by the tears because of pain and sorrow no hope of Tomorrow down through the years but he did it for me Jesus you did it for me and I can't help but praise him when I think think of what I I used to be I was Redeemed by his grace I've been washed in his blood he took my shame upon his back on that Crimson Flood now every time I hear the word something in my heart is stirred I can feel feel the Praises rumbling in my soul maybe you never felt lost and alone and you never felt a burning hell could someday be your home maybe you never needed someone to set you free but I know someone that needed him and that someone is me he did it for me Jesus you did it for me and I can't help but praise him when I think of what I I used to be I was Redeemed by by his grace

gather his children what a reunion Heaven's hope will lead us home as they gathered in secret all hope had been lost the great king that that would lead them had been nailed to a cross but after three

didn't get mad at us we preached for them again back in August and so and then preached for them also back in March so but anyway just wanted to go by the leadership of the Lord amen so we appreciate the Lord appreciate y'all amen and so just want to read you something before we get started and I thought this was pretty good you you might have heard it before you know I you know you hate to sometimes you read things and you know then before long it's on Facebook or whatever somebody said I seen that that was posted you know and you always you know I like being a grandpa or you know they call me Paul Paul call hard I like being that but you know Facebook and all that took joy out of it you know cuz they they said hey have you seen this picture cuz everybody wants to show them that you know picture you know M oh I've done seen that yeah yeah on Facebook and all that stuff so that takes all the joy you know of it but but I appreciate being a you know just it makes us so we you would have never thought we'd arve but here we are you know I can hear Brother br on tape talking about his kids his grandkids and they we're there amen so let me read this to you it's called two viewpoints said Mike went to church one Sunday morning he ordered the organist miss a note during the Prelude and it bothered him immensely he observed two teenagers passing notes when everybody was supposed to be bowed in silent prayer he thought the Usher was watching to see what he put in the offering plate and irritated him he winced as he caught the pastor and six grammar eras during the course of the sermon in the closing hymn as the closing hymn was being sung he slipped out the side door and said what a waste of time what a weird assortment of Hypocrites and jerks Robert went to church one Sunday morning the organist played an arrangement of Wesley's love divine and he thrilled to the beauty and inspiration of it he listened attentively as a Young Man shared with the congregation the difference Jesus Christ made in his life he was happy to see his church take a special offering for people made homeless by a terrible flood and felt a sense of fulfillment to give over and above his tithe it especially appreciate the morning message it gave him the strength he needed to face a new week his heart beat with joy as he saw a young man respond to the invitation following the sermon and commit his life to Christ he felt the warmth and fellowship of God's people at worship and as he walked out the doors of the church his cup was overflowing and he thought how can a person worship here not feel his holy and divine presence interesting thing is both of these men went to the same church on the same Sunday morning but each man found exactly what he was looking for your church has much to offer each week why not come and search for the right thing each week as you worship I thought that was real good ameny we got to come and we got to expect to receive something from God the prophet of God said you get what you expect amen so I come tonight expecting are this afternoon expecting to see more of God Amen expecting him to just do the impossible amen cuz all things are possible to them that believe amen I appreciate that let's stand together again tonight amen amen he has a lot to offer amen it's just like this somebody said well ma is listen t one man said my he called me a buzzard he said that's something he called me an eagle amen depends on what you're looking for he am man you say well if you're looking for a Hollywood Showmanship you come to the wrong place Jesus even told them about John the Baptist what wouldn't you out to see a reed shaken by the wind not John did you go see a somebody that's uh dressed in a in King's cloth and it's not John did you go see somebody not John amen but you he said aren't you a prophet and more than a prophet amen I appreciate the Lord this to se and if you have your Bibles turn with me to the Book of Genesis this the fifth chapter coming from two places of scripture this afternoon Genesis 5 and then over in Genesis chapter 6 how many's got a need this afternoon let us just bow our heads Heavenly Father once again we approach you this afternoon Lord father now Lord we we had one service and it's history Lord God and Father here we are again this afternoon and tired maybe from you know being here all day father but Lord I pray Lord that may you just take all the tness and sleepiness away from us father and may we zero in on what you have for us this afternoon father and father I pray Lord God that you saw the hands Lord you know what was behind each and every hand before it was raised father Lord we're needy people I'm a needy person Lord Jesus and I pray Lord that you just come and and take Lord every need that's in here this afternoon Lord God and just Lord would you touch and heal Lord if that's the situation whatever it may be maybe there's people financial trouble maybe there's people domestic trouble whatever it may be father but Lord I'm here to declare Lord God that you can fulfill every need no matter what it is there's Lord you told Abraham you asked them the question is there anything too hard for the Lord there's nothing too hard for you Lord this afternoon father you're still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so Lord we just ask Lord that you meet every need this afternoon Lord and Lord as we would read your word father I believe the words already anointed just anoint lips to speak it anoint hearts and ears to receive it father for you we have a promise and you said when that word goes out it would not return back void for it to go out and accomplish what it is meant to accomplish may it do that this afternoon for we ask these things in the lovely name of Jesus Christ and God's people said amen Genesis the 5th chapter 22nd verse it says and Enoch walked with God and he begat methusa 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him then over there in the sixth chapter Genesis the eighth and Ninth verses of the sixth chapter said but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generation and Noah walked with God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated this afternoon I like to take little for a thought maybe try not to hold you too long Walking with God Amen Walking with God and Lord as we start here I was thinking along the lines you know here we are and uh uh I was thinking here in and we read in Genesis and it said but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and and and and Noah was a a righteousness preacher preached 120 years and had the same message that it was going to rain because we know what the the the story entails about how that God got tired of uh uh uh uh what the men were doing what the women were doing just seeing everywhere and all this and their their very thoughts were evil and everything and and so but but Noah the Bible says found Grace in his sight amen that's what I want to do and I hope I trust that I do and I hope each and every one of us do this afternoon is find Grace in the sight of the Lord amen I might not find favor and Grace in your side but if I can find favor and Grace in The Lord's Side that's what I want and so we see here that Noah said he would said these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his Generations I think that's you said well how can that be I think that's what God was talking his thoughts about Noah amen hey our thoughts hey we make mistakes we've done this but our thoughts in his mind were perfect I like that amen outside of him we're nothing but with him we're everything with him we're perfect this afternoon Hallelujah and so I think about Noah and I think about all this and I think about the way the world was going brother the Lord over there in the scripture when Jes was said as it was in the days of Noah they were married giving in marriage they planted they built and all that you never seen the likes of it today the building going on all this going on it's a it's a repeat of of back then and he said as it was when the in the days of when the son of man shall be revealed I thought about Noah you know here he was and all that how that he started now I I I I we're fixing to go somewhere to Branson here next weekend and I I've heard about S and S maybe you have they got one I think up in Pennsylvania and they have different things we're going to go see Esther and all that but anyway my son-in-law had a deal had a video about Noah and I look I looked at it and I thought it was real good and here it was Noah living in a day where they said Hey listen was a scientific age you know and God had said hey I'm tired of the way the people are doing I'm going to I'm going to send uh I'm going to destroy a man upon the face of the Earth but you knowah said I here's what I want you to do build me an ark he said build me for the saving of your uh household so building so many inches wide so many inches tall so many you know wide tall and all that long and all that and how that he started building well in this film it depicted now whether Noah had a brother I don't know but how this story how it depicted that Noah had a brother and he came around he was talking to his brother blly brother yeah he said no what are you doing and he Noah be to testify to his brother tell him what he was doing said now you know we're be we were raised right we were taught right and we were taught the things of God and said now look how everybody has gotten away from the things that we've been taught isn't that about the way it is today amen and he begin to share with his brother and his brother said what about this he said well God spoke to me told me to build this both for the sav of my family yeah he said you really believe that Noah now Noah couldn't explain it but he said I believe it with all my heart amen and I I believe it with all my heart and so M how it went on and and dur that fil his his brother goes to the mayor of the city and said Hey listen what's your brother doing down there he said well he he claims that God spoke to him that God's going to send a flood he's the T away everybody's been acting he's TI God has TI of the way everybody's been doing and he's going to destroy man from upon the face of the Earth yeah he said you go down there and tell your brother if he don't join us he can't buy nothing else to be help him build that boat with tell him he's a fanatic tell him say hey I talked to these and we got scientific research we can shoot up there in the Stars we got instruments and surely there's no water up there what's he talking about and so maybe he went back hey just the way it is today amen people don't want to hey people think we're kind of crazy man followers and all this amen but hey if God's revealed it to us let us walk in the way that God has revealed to us amen and he went back and he told no and no said Hey listen I don't care all I know is God said it's going to rain amen and that's what I'm standing on is that God said it was going to rain and he kept preaching and amen and even to the time that Noah entered the Ark he was still preaching you know the story how they came and they thought he was crazy they thought Noah we can do this we can do this surely ain't going to rain and they kept on but till one day it was too late and I tell you brothers and sisters one of these days it's going to be too late for me and you so what we need to do we need to walk with God regardless of what anybody else says cuz one of these days it's going to be too late Hallelujah and so so let me just look now what I want to do for the next few minutes now is look at Enoch's walk with God and look and see and compare our walk because the prophet of God said Enoch was a type of the raptured church now let us look at Enoch's walk and see how he walked and I hope our walk is like his walk amen so the Bible says I believe what is meant by Enoch's walk I think his walk was pleasing to God if you look in Hebrews the 11th chapter the 5th and six verse it says by faith Enoch was translated right right that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God I wonder if we've got that testimony tonight amen that we our walk and our life pleases God that's what I want now I may not please brother uh uh wait I may not please brother Homer but I want to please God not saying that I would do anything to offend these brothers I love these brothers but my walk has got to please God if it don't please anybody else it's got to please God so Enoch I think he didn't care he just wanted to please God verse 6 says but without faith is impossible to please him now we find out that the prophet Ty teaches us that faith is a revelation amen a revelation of what God wants us to do in the hour that we're living in not only that but a revelation of how he wants us to live in the hour that we're living in not only that but a revelation of how our walk should please God said by faith a't amen but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is we first come to God we must believe that God is God is what God Is A Healer God is a deliverer God is this amen he he God is our is our is our way maker he's our provider that's what he is said he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he can do the impossible that he can take my life he can take your life and change it totally around I've seen it do it before I've seen it I remember hey can I just share can I just be myself this afternoon amen I don't know if it's been told here or not but it what it somebody had told another brother and he called me up on the phone and said hey I seen your girlfriend now let me explain that to you amen there's a friend of mine by the name of Mike wheeler and I met him one day when I was living out in ellaa Texas and so we was going to church or or I was and trying to live right being a teenager you know how sometimes it's kind of hey we didn't have it as hard as some of these teenagers have it today hey you know I mean hey come on now you know but hey I I I I feel for you you know we we got all the hey y'all got all these kind of video games and stuff and sometimes you don't see nobody you don't see them you know and all they're on is on this all the time they got real good thumbs and stuff you know and all that you know I think sometimes it's nonsense amen man and I I understand hey maybe there may not be nothing wrong and I'm just hey wrong with them things but hey somewhere along the line we got to put God first absolutely amen so anyway I begin to talk to him how I met he was walking down the street and I love football I that was my life I mean I could tell you all the things and everything and so I had a football in my hand and he would and I see him walking and I didn't know him from Adam and I threw that football on him and said here catch and he dropped it I said you dummy you can't catch that ball what's the matter with you and we got acquainted and we got to talk and I got to witnessing to him I just 15 16 years old about he about the same age and I just started talking to him witnessing to him you know and I tell him I said what would Jesus do he said I don't know I didn't Liv in Jesus's day and so one day he came to church brother Wade he had hair down to here and an elderly sister bless her heart she's in glory now thought it was my girlfriend and said David brought his girlfriend to church today I told Brother Homer that I ain't going to tell you what he said but anyway anyway so anyway he come and he go and he come I still witness to him and there was something about it brother Wade I couldn't he Amen brother I couldn't give up amen I just couldn't brother Bob I just couldn't give up I just talked to him a witness to him five years later I mean we friends I didn't do what he did sometimes he said hey why don't you come I said we we're going to church today he said Sunday he said yeah what say he what said what about Sunday afternoon I said well we going back to church chch Sunday afternoon man you know you couldn't believe that but I talked to him and and so one day we was riding down the road he said David I was driving the car he said David I got to get my life right with God I said well when are you going to do it he hit on the door and he said I'll promise you tomorrow I'll be in this was on a Saturday night he said I promise you tomorrow I'll be in church somewhere I may not be in your church but I'll be in church somewhere he came to church God got a hold of him amen he plays a guitar in the church every now and then he leads singing until this day God can do the impossible amen Oh we must believe that he is amen that he can do the impossible and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now I looked up that word diligently and it means an energetic application absolutely so that means that I'm going to put everything I got into serving God I'm going to put everything hey if I was younger and I and I did this on a Friday night or Saturday night go to a ball game or whatever I'd put everything I got into that ball game if I was a ball game fiend or whatever or a dance fi or whatever amen well what about coming to the house of God and putting everything you got into serving God into worshiping God Amen you don't have to wait for brother Wade you don't have to wait for the song ler but there should be something in your heart say God I love you God I appreciate you he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him H amen so I think that was what was meant by Enoch's walk it was pleasing no special deed there was no special gift but by faith right the Bible says amen amen another thing thing about Enoch's walk amen he realized in the divine presence of almighty God right now you can't walk or let me say it like this some of us I used to work on a public job brother Way D did just some of you and you know sometimes when you work in a public job especially if they don't go to the same church you do they're just you know and they may claim to be Christians and they may do be all sometimes you get you work every day with that person and sometimes you around that person more than you are with your own family working and so you get to know a little bit about them you know what turns them on and what turns them off you know what buttons to push and what buttons not to push so hey you know just cuz you can't I don't believe you can walk work with somebody or walk with somebody every day and not know a little bit about them well what about our walk with Christ amen Enoch the Bible says Enoch walked with God and I believe he realized in the divine presence amen every day there wasn't a day go by that he didn't walk with God and he didn't have fellowship and communion with god oh imagine he might have called him Papa God hallelujah and he he knew all Enoch knew about God and God knew about Enoch I think about that woman over in Memphis when brother bam said Annie won't you pray and when she knelt down and begin to pray my you know sheal with him before amen I hope that was with us tonight that our walk can be that way with God tonight amen that he knows so much about us amen hallelujah amen in other words sometimes working with somebody you share the same interest I hope Walking with God tonight and not only tonight but every day we share the same interest hallelujah we're traveling in the same direction amen not not opposite directions but we're going in the same directions and we're traveling at the same Pace amen they used to tell me the older folks used to tell me when they came to the church cuz they some of them walked to church back in the old days back in the days of the tent revivals and stuff and said the only way they had to get home at because they stayed at church all day and all the way they had to get back home the sun was done down they had to go by Lantern light and they said if you got ahead of the light you messed up if you got the laging behind the light you messed up we got to keep the same Pace we got to walk in the light as he is the light as he shs lights as we walk in the light cuz if we get ahead of the light we'll mess up if we get behind the light we'll mess up so you got to be walking the same direction the same Pace no distractions yeah amen hallelujah you see people driving all the time on their cell phones and stuff distractions amen you see people in this life that's trying to walk with but they got distractions oh God let us get rid of the distractions amen and just walk with him whatever may be distracting us from a fully walk with God Amen and another thing about his walk it was heartfelt amen I believe my walk should be heartfelt in other words amen I believe when I come to the house of God oh and I say Amen or I say praise the Lord or I lift my hands and say hallelujah or whatever it is I don't want to just be going you know how it is they said David are you working are you just going through the motions are you doing this are you just going through the motions are you doing this or you just sweeping everything under the rug I don't want to go through the motions tonight I don't want to just sweep everything under the rug but I want it to be heartfelt when I say amen I want it to be heartfelt when I raise my hands I want I want something on the inside from the inside to really mean it I want to come from way down inside rivers of Living Water springing up to everlasting life amen hallelujah oh my want another thing I want to be his friend he called Abraham his friend and Abraham we were the RO Seed of Abraham I believe he'll be our friend amen another thing about Enoch's walk it was one of great communication amen I believe he had great communication oh that's what I want you take two two people married man and woman there's got to be some communication yeah you as a husband you ever invited somebody over your house you didn't tell your wife or your you as a wife you invited somebody and you didn't tell your husband you got to have some kind of communication around amen oh God help us sometimes you get in trouble hey I I went to work and and they want us you know sometimes how you misunderstood like like uh we had to go I had a where I was working at we had two women supervisors one on the North End of the plant one on the south end of the plant and them two couldn't get alone so what they did they made us go to interaction management classes one Wednesday for a whole month out of that whole month we had to go every Wednesday for a whole month and the other group had to go the next month every Wednesday for a whole month one thing he did he got us out of work for a day he got us we got paid for it but they talked about communication they told us to write a w on a piece of paper well what would you write she said I didn't say a w I said a w he said sometimes it's miscommunication and you don't understand amen it's miscommunication oh my and they had they had about leadership they got a jump rope and tied to and blindfolded everybody except the leader and you had to put your hands on that jump rope about four or five of us and the leader was blindfolded the rest as was and they made the leader would in they we going up a set of steps and you had to be confidence in your leader oh God help us to be confidence in you as we're walking with you amen and have great communication amen I want great God whatever you want me to do help me to communicate with you and the only way I can communicate with you is through prayer amen and dedication of my life help me to have great communication I believe Enoch had that great communication he could tell him his Sorrows yes Hall in prayer yeah amen he could tell him and show him his joy and praise Hal hallelujah thank you Lord I love you Lord he could show his joy and praise he could like I said he could tell him his sorrows and prayer he could tell them his confess his oh confess his sin we have an advocate anybody body sin and says any man said we have an advocate with Jesus Christ the righteousness amen and you know what about him if you confess to him he won't put it on Facebook hallelujah amen it'll be just between you and almighty God amen hallelujah amen amen that's what hey he had joy in Praise sorry in prayer they talked about confessed your sins he had a continuous walk it wasn't just a day or two or just on Sunday morning Sunday afternoon but I believe it was every day another thing about Enoch's walk it was a life that was Progressive in other words I believe he enjoyed more amen and the more he enjoyed the more he understood and the more he understood the more he loved amen and the more he loved the more he could receive and the more he could receive the more he could give out amen that's what I want to do I want my life to be that Progressive I want my walk to be that Progressive that I can enjoy more I can understand more I can love more I can receive more and I can give out more hallelujah amen it was one that was Progressive another thing about Enoch's walk I believe it was a holy life yeah I believe it was one of Holiness amen cuz I believe God will never walk outside the way of Holiness amen the Bible says the Lord has no company with the unjust and the rebellious amen but it was a holy life amen I believe his life was pleasing it was one of great communication amen he realized in the divine presence amen and also it was AO oh he wanted to make sure everything was holy holy unto the Lord holy holy unto the Lord you remember when the priests when they went behind the veil they were dressed right amen they were they they they had the right kind of garment on the right kind of shoes on the right kind of hat on everything was right a bell and a pomegranate b and a pomegranate and when they walked it walked it rang out holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy unto the Lord amen and they say that Legend in history says that they tied a rope around the priest's ankle because the priest was the only one that could go back there and if if he died that's how they did drag him out now you know how they told that he was dead his Bell stopped ringing oh God help us God let us not let not our Bell don't let our Bells stop ringing but may we keep ringing holy holy unto the Lord amen it's not a dead church not a dead religion amen but it's alive forever more and we're walking holy holy unto the Lord amen another thing about Enoch's life it was a happy one like I said

of the shadow of death I'm I'm right there with them oh what what a happy life amen to walk with the almighty God just think of the privilege that mean you got hey man if if the president would call

what I'd have done if I had but I thank God for his protection amen hallelujah he's he's a protector amen it's a safe one amen he'll keep us from all evil he'll keep us from diseases he'll keep us from these things amen another thing about Enoch's walk it was one of Honor just to walk with the King of Kings and the Lord of lords what an honor what a privilege it is that he chose me amen hey like I quoted that song this morning never in my wildest dreams whatever I think I see for the age I was he he could have easily passed me by for the age I was living in was poor wretched blind amen but here we are thank God hey I thought it's going to all be over but here we are still fighting the greatest battle ever fought but we're going to keep pressing CU there's going to be a bride he promised it there's going to be somebody that's going to get out of here in a Rapture amen I may have to go by the way of the Grave brother W may have to go by the way of the Grave some of you but there's going to be a people that's alive and remain and going to take a body change that's just say the Lord by the prophet of God Amen Hallelujah I'm so glad amen he called my name it wasn't like David gab but something on the inside tore themselves loose don't wonder job was fix to cry and they said don't we John we found one worthy amen amen the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed amen he's worthy John turned thought he's going to see a li but he's seen a bloody lamb Hallelujah my my my my it's just great to walk with the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen he could have chose somebody else oh but I'm glad he chose me amen now let me be a faithful amen servant let me walk with you Lord amen amen I may make mistakes but let my mistakes be stepping stones to others Amen Let Me Be an influence to others Lord amen oh it's an honor another thing about his walk it was one that was noteworthy right all it said was he not walk with God right what else needs to be said that's right when you like that brother wait to be put on your Tombstone when it came back or whatever and brother way Dell the day you were born the day you died and it says and he walked with God what what an opportunity man what a thing to be oh that's all it was said and Enoch walked with God who needs much details just that he walked with God oh God I don't need much details tonight just that I walk with God just that I took God in his word just that I serve God with all my heart he might have been a public man I don't know if he worked out anywhere or not but you know what he had a testimony and others oh I want my life to be an influence wherever I go whatever I do hey man I remember one time there's a lady came to our church years ago and she come and she's going home now I didn't know she was going on I lost contact with her you know how it is sometimes you like to pull up thing I seen her obituary when she died I said my you know and I talked to her and she come to church I invited her she come to church her and friend of mine I helped him clean some buildings part time he come and they were boyfriend and girlfriend they Liv together and she said David I think it's all right you know and all that so I said well I said okay let me ask you a question said you think it's all right but let me say what the other people think and she said oh you know and she come to church you can ask my wife she lived out there and maybe I wouldn't preach maybe our pastor would preach or whatever and she' leave out there and tears would be rolling down her eyes amen I don't know where she stood with the Lord but I hope that my life was an influence amen oh he made his life I believe Enoch's life was an influence to those around him amen maybe to his children or whatever it was amen also I believe he was a family man the Bible says he begat sons and daughters and maybe you know how hey I I I I I do it like this a lot of people told me brother homers told me a lot of people even myself when first come up I remember when we first came in the message 1969 my I still got them records that my dad had the great Harlot and all that stuff little red records and everything and that you know the real to reals and stuff like that hey and many times my mom and dad brother Homer even myself when I became a married and got a family sometimes you had to wait till it was Plum quiet to house everything was settled down and then you could listen and absorb so maybe he was a family man maybe he had to wait till every night till everything was settled down and he could say Lord what would you have me to know today Papa God what would you want your servant he KN to know oh my just oh he he was he he oh he still was a family man he still walked with God Amen the Bible say he lived in an evil age is a day of mockers and despisers where few love God church and state were proposing Alliance fashion and pleasure Ru the hour and unhollow compromise was the order of the day right amen but you know what he still walked with God now I don't know where I put this paper it may be at home but I had a paper where this one writer writes about the conditions between Enoch and the flood and I'm just going to kind of paraphrase it but he said there's sin everywhere yep Conformity to the world y the sethites and the Canaanites and said it was mixed marriages and things were just hey amen World everywhere amen where and and and Longevity they thinking they had long life could live long and then they put the Judgment of God out of the picture they didn't think they they they thought man judgment who cares about judgment we're going to eat drink and be married and that's how it was and he he took his he took his thoughts from Psalms 14:1 where it says the fool has said in his heart there's no God Amen hey he don't just say it like that they come out and say but the way they live and the way they act and their attitude proves that they they're saying that there's no God or they think there's no God and the the dress the the way they dress was evil the way they walk was evil their ways were evil their thoughts were evil their imaginations were evil their designs were evil but you know what all that was evil but in all that Noah and Enoch both without the Holy Ghost like me you have it the Bible says they walk with God hallelujah they could in the conditions that they had what about me and you with the Holy Ghost with God on the inside of us amen oh we are be like David said I feel like running through a troop and jumping over a high wall Heen hallelujah hallelujah what a walk amen what a walk amen and the Bible says over there he bore witness in other words he could not be be silent hey sometimes we can't be silent if you got to say something sometimes hey set in love now sometimes if you can't sit with words just let let your life live it amen but Enoch bore witness he he couldn't keep still amen we used to sing a song back in Pentecost I just you know it says Hey I just can't keep it to myself I got to tell somebody else and when the Fire gets the burning way down the inside amen I just can't help it I got to tell somebody else amen I just got to tell somebody else brother Wade if I can't tell him anything but how the candle got lit amen and the Bible says over there in Jude the 14th and 15th chapter says uh 14th and 15th verse excuse me and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesy to these saying behold the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his Saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly Deeds which I have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him right that's a mouthful in it brother Brandon says like this on show the father 1954 he said I can see him when he died his soul went down into the regions of the lost I can see him knock at the door of the Lost somebody says who is it open the doors and there're the mingling souls they in prison waiting for the day of judgment he said you are to be believed Enoch you are have believed the prophets I'm the Virgin born son of God that Enoch said it'd come with 10 thousands of his Saints I'm he I'm the one and everything was written of me in my father's word I have confirmed it y on the cross it's finished Clos the doors that's all of it they had to recognize amen can you imagine there he was get down there knocks on the gates the doors of hell oh Satan comes up there says you're here you finally arrived I thought I got you when I got Noah I thought I had you when I had Moses and Jesus said hey I'm him I'm him grabbed the keys from his side kicked him back in there slammed the doors and he went to unlock some more doors amen the Bible says he left captivity captive gave sent gifts unto men he started unlocking some door here come Abraham amen he said my God Sarah that's him that's the one I seen coming down the dusty road that day I call him Elohim that's the one I told my servant to go kill get a young tnder cat kill it amen and we ate sat under the old oak tree drank uh ate cornbread drank milk and had some beef amen that's him Sarah that's the one that said hey I'd have a son that's him imagine job looked through he said my God that's him that's the one I caught the vision amen though the skin worms destroy my body yet my flesh I'll see him and that's him amen David said that's him that's him that's the one I prophesied that I said I'll not leaveing soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to seek corruption I like these banjos around here I bet old David got a little heavily on that harp amen when he seen him said that's him that's the one amen hallelujah amen hallelujah yes that's him they had to recognize amen oh I'm glad that's what I want my walk to be like amen another thing about his walk I think he finished his work early how many's ever went to work and you finished your work early God they said go ahead and go on home you'll still get paid for your eight hours but you done a good job just going home oh I believe he had his he done done his work had a testimony and he traveled faster and reached his home sooner than anybody else and and he was a young man in that day compared to the one hey 365 years let me know that there's young people that can live this if you'll just surrender your life to Christ if he did it back then and we talked about the conditions and young man what about you young people today amen just give God your life just surrender to God and walk with him and the Lord will see you through he'll see you through amen hey he's seen us through he'll see you through there said brother call different ones that old amen some of them hey they've already lived past their lot of time but they're here and they can testify that God's been with him that God's kept them that has a walk with God Amen there probably been some heartaches there's probably been some mistakes there probably been some failures but God has kept them seen them through every heartache every trial every battle and you young people today he can see you through Hallelujah he can see you through amen hallelujah hallelujah see he had to be translated Flesh and Blood can't inherit the kingdom of God the Bible said that God took him amen you lord said he was not yes for God took him now America has astronauts Russia has cosmonauts but God has wasnot amen one of these days this bride's going to be a wasnot amen and she was not for God took her some morning between 6 and 9ine you can look for me but I'll be gone amen oh just over there one of these days I'm going to grab that woman back there by the hand amen her gray hair be gone I'll have a forehead of ha I said come on let's take a body change together hallelujah amen let's take one together amen no all our heartaches all our trials everything will be all over the amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my now said God took him amen I don't know if anybody saw him when he left like they saw an Elijah they seen Jesus I don't know maybe they did maybe they don't but I I know the scripture says God took him right maybe he was missed can you imagine somebody said one day I was out in Arkansas years ago somebody was cutting wood and brother Homer tells me that if you used to live in Arkansas their license plate used to say land of opportunity they don't know more said when you get an opportunity you need to leave but they said back then back then they invented jobs they didn't have no job they just invented one and and so I can imagine amen oh I can imagine this guy was saying hey I don't know why I cutting this wood up far maybe I'm going to just leave it for somebody when I leave here amen come on over just take my place take my car everything maybe he was Miss he was not found I don't know if they went out look hey Elijah they sought for him they sent 50 men of the sons of the prophets went out and searched him but they couldn't find them oh one of these days we're going to be gone amen I'm going to be gone amen grave going to hold this body down hallelujah amen I'm ready to get out of here sir maybe Enoch's departure maybe was a testimony a lot of people may be doubted a change your body a Rapture oh but there's a change of body coming there's a reward for the righteous amen now can I read you some few quotes then let me just read you these and we'll try to hurry amen listen he said I can take him a little time anyway but anyway he by itself 1954 and you're here to fulfill it too he said just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to right or left hand just keep moving on not like this if someone comes up if something comes up in the church walk with God on Hallelujah he says if sickness strikes you walk with God amen if the neighbor don't like you walk with God and Keep On Walking with God a not one day walk like that yes sir and let me just stop here he said Enoch one day walk like that I can see oh Enoch is kind of reminds me these two sisters one time and they were talking they was just fellowshipping back and forth talking said man did you hear that message the other night oh brother Wade he sure did shell the corn M they was just talking about the services and talking about the goodness of the Lord and one of them sister said Hey listen look what time it is said I got to get me going home she said oh we're having so much

want to come back anymore says amen walk with God doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah doctor said you can't well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that Covenant that he give you that he confirm it just walk with God then he says don't pattern yourself after somebody of the world you pattern yourself after him see watch him watch his life don't act like so and so does sister Susie or brother Jackson or whoever it may be don't don't act like them you just walk with him fill my way every day with love as I walk with that Heavenly Dove just stay right there watch how it sweetens you and cuts all the world away oh my you don't care what the people says you're walking with God again 1961 or greater than Solomon is here but you know when something is moving in your heart to find God you don't know no fear right amen you said Hey listen can I walk brother brandom can I you really he said you really walk you really hunger to walk he said God's putting in your heart you say I might make a mistake what mistake God will take you through it don't you never worry that if God is telling you in your heart say brother I would like to be I like to preach the whole gospel but I'm afraid to they'll excommunicate me they take my papers away from me he said throw it back at them and start walking with God hallelujah he said throw it back at him and start walking with God that's what I want to do can I go on just a little bit further amen just give me about how many give me five more minutes 5 10 15 oh Pentecostal trick amen hallelujah amen 1961 only believe he said wouldn't that be nice if we had a testimony like that Brethren I'd do only that which pleases God he said wouldn't that be wonderful like Enoch walked with God he said 500 years and had a testimony that he pleased God he didn't have to die he just went up just in a little afternoon stroll he just started walking out and just thought well I've been in here on Earth long enough I'll just walk on up and just started by faith he thought well I've been here long enough so I'm kind of tired of being around here I think I'll just stroll on up till I hit the milky white way and just walk on up and knock on the door heyen ah I remember that song I'm going to pass Jupiter Neptune and Mars amen and run up the milky white hallelujah amen all I feel like running amen what was that brother used to sing that song I feel like running all the way home amen oh sometimes I feel like running I think I could run back to Alabama and back amen amen hallu no wonder brother BR when he seen that black man get up there and preach little he said man if he got on somebody like that what would he do if he get on me and young man he said my goodness he said he he he said he got up there said he didn't preach what the other preachers was preaching he took him over and brought them over from their horizontal rainbow amen where were you J when laid the foundation of the world the sons God shouted for Joy amen all this and all of a sudden he said it hit him he jumped up pled his heels together went tiptoeing off that platform said you don't even have enough room up here for me preach said man he had more room than what I have back up amen it just something about it that just hey just walking with God there just something about it that stirs you amen oh hallelujah it's better than a ball game hey it's it's better than all them things I ain't knocking if you go hey that that's up to you but it's better than that amen you said when somebody kicked the touchdown some about one of these days somebody's going to make a touchdown in a Rapture amen somebody's going to make a touchdown with the body change hallelujah oh let me be a part of it amen they used to say you remember when brother Brown was here he they say well brother Brown and they disfellowship one another because one group said he's coming back on a white cloud there other group said he's coming back on a White Horse He said what difference does it make as long as he's coming oh god oh we ought to love one another I mean I understand hey there's some out there that's kind of ridiculous and everything and you got to watch it you got to watch the Bible says watch try the spirits how do you try by the word of God Amen but hey why we should love one another and pray for one another this going to blow your mind I pray for brother Billy Paul I pray for Brother Joseph amen and I hope that they know me they pray for for me amen hey I think brother B said hey if if you don't pray for me pray for my f I think he would want you a prophet of God he would want you to pray for him his great you know in the adoption series I think it's in the adoption series brother wa you may correct me on this but in the adoption series one time I think he said it's his was his heart's desire he said I come walking in a church one day Mama in my arm he said Becky on the piano Sarah on the organ and said and and Joseph in the pull pit as a man's desire that's what his desire was heyy what great desire it's our desire we want to see our kids saved we want to see our love that's our desire as a human being he why not pray for one another amen hey we are two that's only way we going to make it amen oh he said when I feel death listen he just went on through the air he did that by faith the Bible said he did oh when I feel death come knocking around my door I want to have that kind of Faith don't you just say well so long old world I ain't going to walk away I'm going to walk away from you now now and just start walking on just walk right on up and pass the moon and the stars strip the milky white way and go into the Spheres and fears and out the fears just go on into Glory he said that's right again 1965 he said let's take another he said this is the Easter seal he said let's take another man with this quickening power there's a man Way Long Ago by the name of Enoch when a new thing came along when something came along and said well now we have to go back to the old school or this or that or the other Enoch walk with God whatever God said do now listen to this I thought this was motion brother man he said whatever God said do Enoch never miss one word can you imagine never miss one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God yes he was an eagle that had been called to that day hallelujah how do you know all I can say is is maybe God show brother bradam that right you know people want to say well he missed it here he missed it there let me ask you a question the first time ever Janis and Jers was mentioned in the Bible who mentioned him Paul is it this Janice and Jers now and it didn't say what their names was back there in Exodus and all that but I believe God showed Paul hey if he showed Paul can't he show brother brandom amen said he never missed one word whatever God said he just wouldn't done it God help us to do that help me to do that said he walked with God what was he he was the son of God eag and when come time he was so full of that quickening power remember he had walked 500 years or more before God not one time had he missed his word not one time did he misbehave himself that's right not one time did he do but kept the testimony everything that God told him to do he wouldn't done it right listen no argument about it you're still working on me Lord he just would and done it no matter what anybody else thought he just would and done it why he was full of that quickening power amen and when it come time for that old man to die God just sitting down the letter and he walked up home he quickened him and took his mortal body up in the Rapture amen that's that quicking power oh God that's that's that's what we got today that that quicking power amen hallelujah let's stand together tonight Walking with God that's what I want to do I got one more it's on my phone let me pull it up I thought this was real good find it real quick I put these in my phone I put them on uh after I get through program them in my computer I put them on PDF and you know every now then you get something after you preach a message and if you preach it again or whatever somewhere else or whatever something you know or somebody said something man you just said man I go along with this you got you know just let me read you I somewhere this was in somebody's study and I thought this was real good I thought my listen what he says this is on Father the hour has come 1956 he said now Jehoshaphat his son raising up to take his place had a good background to look at upon to see that when a man now listen what he says to see that when a man will walk for God and walk with God God will walk with that man when a man will walk for God and with God God will walk with that man but when that same individual turns his back from God then God just lets him shift for hisself and we find out it's very sad thing when we have to shift for ourselves that's right brother oh God yeah I don't want to have to shift for myself brother K I have it hard enough right now let alone brother Wade shifting for myself do you want to walk with God toight do you want to shift for yourself or do you want to walk with him he said when a man will walk with God and for God God will walk with him but when that same individual turns away God will let him shift for himself let's B our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just love you so much and Lord just Lord maybe I got a little bit beside myself Lord forgive me Lord there's something about your word father and what it's done not only for me but I Lord Jesus Lord I just want to walk with you Lord father we've seen what kind of walk had we seen what kind of walk he knock had Lord Lord and Lord we've seen where that riter about the conditions all their ways were evil their designs were evil their
