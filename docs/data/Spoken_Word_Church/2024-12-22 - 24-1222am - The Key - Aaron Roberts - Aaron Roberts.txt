========================================

amen so uh as we start this morning let's just all bow our heads and pray heavenly father it's a great opportunity to be in your house with those of like Precious faith and father we just pray that everything is said and done will be for your honor and Glory we just pray that Lord you just bless brother Bob as he comes bring the word to us Lord and as we look into the scripture this morning Lord for this Sunday school lesson we just pray that you just come and help help us and Lord just bless our words and Lord just speak to each heart and each life those that are listening in Lord the ones that couldn't be here with us we just pray that you'll be with them also commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen this morning I talk about a little bit about the time of year and uh looking at the the life of of Jesus and you know we understand this is not the the time that Jesus was born but we recognize this is the time that we recognize and we give thanks for the gift of God that came whatever time of the year we know the prophet said it was in in April but you know it should be that we we should be honoring and thanking God for that gift every single day and you know it it's it's kind of interesting you see people that you know um you know as brother Ram talked about there's a lot of people that they spend a lot of time and it becomes such a uh a worldly and uh it's more about a financial kind of uh holiday and celebration and and you know then other people they're they're always on the polar opposite of that and you know they they don't want to have anything to do with it and you know it's it's all Pagan and you know there there's there's no good there's no benefit in it and you know it's just like you know I can't believe anybody would have anything to do with any of it and you know but but you know like brother bam said you got to you got to look in the middle you know you you you got to you got to find that center point I mean because you can you can go either way too far but you got to find the right meaning and you that's that's the main thing about this time of year you know I I was talking to a a guy at work and um we were we were talking about um the holidays and we were talking about different things and you know the way the way I look at it we were we were talking about you know kids and you know raising kids and you know about the holidays and all kinds of these things and it and I said it's sad that people spend more time talking about Santa Claus and and all of these things than they do about Jesus and I said because the greatest gift that you're ever going to have the greatest gift that you're ever going to give your children is Sal is the Plan of Salvation to bring them to a knowledge of Jesus Christ it's not you know because everybody talks about um all of the the financial things and you know all the monetary things all that's going to pass away but the greatest gift that we've ever received has been Jesus Christ in our life he came and took on our took on flesh he C he came from glory and condescended to be like you and I and you know as as as brother R was talking one time you know you you look at this great uh expectation that the the great Scholars and the Pharisees and all had of what was going to take place but you know he came the way the word said was going to come he had a humble lowly birth he came like you and I did very humble and so he came to live the same kind of life to experience the same things that you and I experience and he and he stepped down into that to to be like you and I that we might be like him and you you see that you know when you have these your kids and you realize you know the free gift is a gift of Salvation Jesus Christ coming and living in you taking up residence in you but when he when he came and I was like that's the same thing about giving a gift and receiving a gift this time of year I always think about it's not what the gift is but in the spirit in which it's given somebody took the time to buy something for you whether it's little or not how no matter how big it is you know if somebody takes the time to think of you and take their hard-earned money and they go out and buy something for you you know I really I really honor that because you know that means something to me that somebody would do that and it and it's you know so it I I was telling the guy at work see that is the type of the time that in which we're living Christ came to take on our our sin he came and as just as the scripture said he had to be born to be just like us that that he might be able to die in our stead but you know you you see how but to understand the the time in which we live how how everybody misses these things and you know but to understand the scripture was spoke spoken of what was going to take place and you know we we we miss the the import importance of things and that's the reason why I I entitled this the key because many things are so locked up to people they're so bound they don't understand things but they don't realize that Jesus Christ is the key he's what will unlock these things because there's a lot of mysteries like just like in the days of Jesus when he came they didn't understand his his birth they didn't understand what he was fulfilling but he kept pointing them back to the scripture to tell them he said search the scriptures and them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me he kept pointing them back to the word to tell them and you know the there in in Luke and Luke 4 you know when when Jesus comes into the temple that day you know he's speaking and he he goes to the priest and he takes the word takes the word of Isaiah and he walks up there and the priest hands him the scroll and he opens it up and he begins to read and so he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised so when he was reading about that he was telling them what he came to do he came to this this is what he came to do he's pointing them back to the scripture what the what the prophet had said and so here he is he's speaking because he came to bring those that were captive he bring to set them free here he come it come here's the Liberty that you have the freedom that you have is in Jesus Christ and so you have you have this Liberty and so you know because they they were bound as brother Bram talked about you know the the scripture uh we'll read it here in a minute but you know there in the scripture when Jesus was talking about he he told rebuke the lawyers and the FES he said because you won't go in and You Hinder them that would go in but they have the opportunity but you are holding them back and so here they are he's he's bringing this this message of Liberty and freedom and you know brother Bram says you know in in the message the patriarch Abraham he says how many of you feel bound feel the pressure of the enemy you know how how many you know because we all live under pressure we have all we all have struggles and problems and and all these things but you know we look at how all these things but see when you when you think about all these pressures and and you you you feel Bound by things and things hold you back but you know God God didn't come for us to live like this he came that that we might have Liberty and have freedom that we might walk in in the in the liberty of the word and to be free and you know you take you take the word as it as it comes and you know there in the in the scripture you know when when you look back at the the the Christmas story there and you know Gabriel comes to Zacharias and you know he's he's talking to him about having a son and you know and he's like well how can these things be but you know God still had a plan that was going to take place whether he believed it or not God was going to fulfill his word you know he said well you know what you're not going to be able to talk until your son's born but you know here's here's this little humble virgin receiving the same visitation and takes that word and says be it unto me according to Thy word you know she had she had that that belief you know brother says one of the keys that we have that unlocks these things is faith faith is the key to unlock these things and so if you have if you have faith to believe and and and you look at the testimony that she carried to Elizabeth no no no doubt she she was confused about all this who who else had ever had this experience take place but here come Mary and her faith come up there and told her listen the Fulfillment of Isaiah is coming the Messiah the gab Gabriel has come told me these things and here she was these six months without any any life of John moving or anything but you brother said all it took was her speaking that name of Jesus and he leaped in his mother's womb and that's all it takes this morning is the name of Jesus I think about that song I speak the name of Jesus over every situation every Power that comes against you I speak the name of Jesus because that's that's what would break every yoke every every bondage Every Chain every prison door that binds you it's faith in Jesus and when when we think about well we just think about a a baby in a Manger no no that was Deliverance just like just like when when amram and Joseph Ed was out praying for years and and praying for a deliverer in in Egypt they were God's people and they had a promise they and that promise was to them and they had to wait all those years but you know what it never changed their prayer it never changed their belief in what God was going to do for them and here and here a son was born under the penalty of death all those other young babies were killed but you know what God had his hand on Moses to bring forth a deliverer and you know what they acted in faith to carry and took care of that boy and sent him out in that little Ark but you know what he went but he went to the exact place that God wanted him to go to go through the things that he had to go through but you know what you know what their their their faith didn't change when Moses was born and they had to send him down the Nile they didn't change their because you know what he's the deliverer all those years because what happened the next thing you know we see Joseph bed has got Moses again and he's sitting on her lap and she's teaching him you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter you're the deliverer you've got a calling of God on your life and it's like but you know he didn't he didn't stay in the plan of God and allow God to do the work he got to the point where he's like well I can do it in my own self but God wanted him to do it in the time frame because you know after he had went through all the great things of of Egypt and and reached such a high Pinnacle in his career and all the things that he had experienced then all of a sudden God had him on the backside of the desert herd and sheep and he thinks he's the lowest thing in the world in the world and he wouldn't amount to Hill of beans but what was it God said it took 40 years to put that in him it took 40 years to get it out of him and he went through all of that and he got to the by going through all of that he got him to the place where God could use him and then God come to him and speak to him through a pillar of fire and speak to him and tell him listen now I want you to fulfill what you've always been what you've known now you didn't believe it you had your doubts you know it's like how how you going to be this great deliverer on the backside of a desert nobody knows you're there when you when you've had the greatest things you've experienced the greatest things in the world and it's like well I've reached the bottom but no God still had his hand on him to bring him to the place where God wanted to use him and it's like now and the first thing out of moses' mouth well well I I can't do this because I can't speak you know I gotta have I got you know I've got got my excuses but you know what God had answers for his excuses it's like listen who created a man's mouth it didn't change the fact that whatever whatever happened in your life gonna set you back if if God if God has called you to do something then you know what there's a path and a way for you to get there if God's called you to be a son and daughter of God and live in the freedom and the Liberty in which Christ is because if we're in Christ and we're we're a new creature we're a new creation then you know we can live in the liberty of the word and it's like well we feel Bound by things well you know what that he is here this morning for us to be free because the scripture tells us whom the son has set free is free indeed then if that if he has if he has set us free then we are free but many times the problem is is we lack the key that it takes to unlock these things see it it'll see brother says in the name of Jesus Christ see it's so powerful tonight and he said if we understood that see it ought to be among the people here tonight brother Ram said and he said ought what ought it to do to a sick man or a sick woman if the if the word is true and it's went forth then you can set you can be free from those things he's here the same yesterday today and forever if he's ever done it once then he's here to do it again says brother BR said Jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now if Jesus is the door to all these promises of God faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God he said faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does not faith in his finished work it's these keys that we're speaking on when he's speaking of the key brother R says you know when you he says it was the key to the door that stopped the mouths of lions it unlocked the prison doors he said it quenched the violence of fire escaping the edge of the sword brought back the dead back to life again it was Faith the key of faith in the Living God he said that hand that man that woman who can take that key of Faith they can unlock every promise God made see the key is here he said any correct key has levers on the inside of the lock and it takes a certain form a certain shape of them keys to turn those levers and just one little lever out of the way will mess the whole thing up but so we have to follow exactly exactly the right way I was I've been I've been kind of looking at this for a little bit and I uh was went looking for a filing cabinet I want want a two drawer just a little one and so I looking for one that wasn't cost you an arm and a leg and uh so I I've went around some of these uh Liquidator places and you know secondhand stores and everything trying to find one well I found one and they had so I went to go look at it well by the time I got there they had already sold it but the lady said well I've got another one and because I I saw it and she saidwell I can't sell that one and I was likew why can't you sell it and she's likew because uh we don't have any keys to it and so I I you know we was looking around and I asked her I said well how much will you take for that one and I kept trying you know she was just w i i don't know so I you know finally I said well I mean really what what would you take for it and she said I'll give it to you she said well I can't sell it CU it ain't got any keys to it but you know I was talking to Richard yesterday so I took it I took it home I was like listen there's more than one way to skin a cat I mean I've I've I've had to drill out many locks in my lifetime people lose their keys or whatever and I've drill I've drilled out locks before and just put in a new lock with new keys but Richard went over looked at I showed it to him and he went over and took a picture of the lock and he looked it up he said well you can buy a key for it on Amazon you can you can get a but the the problem is is see when when people look at things they have they have it right in their mids but the problem is they say Well it it it doesn't do me any good but the problem is is they don't know what the key is the key to unlock it it was very simple but they miss that how many how many times is brother Brown all through the scripture we see so many people they miss the plan of God God right in their midst and here's God speaking to them and the problem is is they don't recognize what the key to their problem is you know brother Brown continues on and he was talking about and and the meetings and everything and he says when he's speaking of the the the meetings and all he says that's what I want to do to you you to do rather he's speaking he said it's prayer that I depend on and he's he's asked you know talking about people praying about the meetings and he said that's the secret of all the mysteries of God that's the key that opens the door to everything of God is prayer if you pray and believe when you pray then believe that you receive what you asked for and God will make it known he says see and the other one in in the message from the KE key to the door brother says therefore I believe in the Full Gospel every word of God that turns the power of God loose that turns his blessings to the people it's the key to the door that's unlocks it so what did Brother Brown tell tell us if you want to get closer to God what what did he say that you had to do read your Bible and pray so here's one quote where brother Bram says prayer is what's going to unlock these things but the other one he said every word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and so we have today we have what we need but like brother brandom said there's many times we're too afraid to act on it we have what we have need of and so you see people come bound and you know they they're locked in certain situations and chains of circumstance or whatever and but you know what God has come here to make you free to free you from these things what's the greatest gift that you can have is eternal life and what comes with eternal life the blessings of God all the blessings that come that that are part of the of the the word of God that are blessings to you see all what what comes from having the word what comes from these things the gift of God the blessings of God the fruits of the spirit they belong to you you can you can have those I uh I want to share this I had a I don't I don't want to embarrass her but uh I had a I had a dream some just a few weeks ago and uh I was sitting there and I was on a train there was several of people from here in the church was on this train riding and I was sitting on a bench by myself and kayle Black come over there and my dream she come over sit down beside me and we got to talking well she gave me these stickers these little colorful stickers and everything had all these different things on it but we got talking and then she got up walked off well I got to looking through the through the stickers and I was as I was flipping through them you know it was like meekness and gentleness and longsuffering and peace and joy and I you know it just kept reading all these all these on these stickers had all these things and it was just like man that's that's what but when I got to the last one the last one was bigger that all the rest of them had a great big sticker it was great in big and boss gold emboss thing big fancy one and it had two words on it it said the substance and you know I I thought about that you know you see all of those peace and joy and longsuffering and meekness and gentleness and then you got virtue knowledge Temperance patience God but what is the one that that all that hinges on what's the most important one is have faith is the substance and if you have the substance this morning then you know what you can claim all the rest of them that's the main one is having that substance and it's a and it's a free gift this morning you know brother I'm talking about claiming your healing well the first thing you got to to do is believe it in your mental faculty you got to believe that God has healed you that the word speaks to you don't believe don't speak to anybody else by his stripes I'm Healed then then it's not anybody else that word is mine you know I when they took me to the when went to the hospital 26 months ago I went to the hospital I had a cardiac Ari me and I had had it for a while and nobody I had told anybody but I I just I just knew something was wrong and I when I went to the doctor because I couldn't I I just couldn't function anymore and I really thought I had a heart problem when they got me to Northeast Georgia they were checking me out and they like you don't have a heart problem they couldn't find anything wrong with me they run cholesterol everything they said the only problem that you got is your a1c's high you got high blood sugar which I didn't know that called cars cardiac arhythmia but I do now but you know when I went through all that and you know I told myself how long do I have to be on this medicine that's that's the one goal to get off the medicine you know because I don't I don't want to be on it forever God didn't call us to be on it you know what I mean I thank God for medicine I thank God for hospitals and doctors but you know what I got my faith in the great physician he's the one that carries you through because all they're going to do is give you a pill that's going to treat a symptom and they're going to give you another pill to treat another symptom but you know you know it's just like they put you on they put you on something for sugar it ain't long they got you on something for cholesterol the next one they got you a heart peel or blood pressure peel why because it starts messing with your body but I told him I was like listen I don't want to be on this thing and it's like well you know they they give you mixed signals like whether whether or not you can get off of this thing or not it's like well one of them said well you might be able to no well I don't know you may have to be on it for a while but you know what I I got the medical advice but I got one that's a divinely written medical advice that come from glory and it said I can be free of that and it's taken me 26 months and I knew one of the things I was going to have to do is I was going to have to learn how to control my appetite and you know what it's a it was a battle but you know what it's a battle that I won through Jesus Christ you know you struggle with things but the scripture told me I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me and I thank God that my A1C came down and I'm off the I'm off the medicine amen because God Is A Healer but he'll also bring you through the trials and and the battles that you've got to fight but you know what don't give up because he'll be right there with you when you're weak he is strong I'm so glad that I've got one to lean on and that's what I want you to know this morning Jesus Christ came as a free gift to you yes and all those Redemptive blessings belong to you in Christ Jesus amen God bless you have sister Esther come this morning [Applause]
