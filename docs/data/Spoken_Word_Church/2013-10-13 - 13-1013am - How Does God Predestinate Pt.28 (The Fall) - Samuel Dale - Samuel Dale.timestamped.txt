[3:06] Corinthians 11 Heavenly Father we thank
[3:09] you for this day in your grace thank you
[3:13] for being you and revealing yourself
[3:15] unto us and we pray that you would just
[3:17] guide us now as we attempt to speak
[3:19] about you and that your love and
[3:22] understanding would be each with each
[3:23] and every one of us bless those that are
[3:26] not here remember the sick among us you
[3:28] sense your word you and healed us and
[3:31] delivered from destruction so we believe
[3:33] you we just ask you now to have your way
[3:35] with each one of us and teach us to wait
[3:38] Lord upon you because in waiting we can
[3:41] trly come to a place of patience and we
[3:44] need that so much forgive our sins as we
[3:47] keep saying unto you because we want to
[3:49] be clean and left in you as white guide
[3:52] us now and keep us in Jesus name
[3:56] amen Romans
[3:58] 8 we've read this scripture now 28 times
[4:02] so you ought to know it by heart but uh
[4:06] we just keep on
[4:07] going and we know that all things work
[4:10] together for good to them that love God
[4:12] to them who are the called according to
[4:13] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[4:16] did also predestinate to be conformed to
[4:19] the image of his son that he might be
[4:21] the firstborn among many Brethren
[4:23] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[4:26] he also called and whom he called them
[4:28] he also Justified
[4:30] in whom he justified them he also
[4:33] glorified what shall we then say to
[4:35] these things all of that's right what
[4:37] can we say if God be for us who can be
[4:41] against us right so let's turn over
[4:45] to um 2
[4:47] Corinthians
[4:51] 11 beginning with verse
[4:55] one would to God you could bear you
[4:58] could bear with me a little while in my
[5:00] Folly and indeed bear with me for I am
[5:03] jealous over you with Godly jealousy for
[5:05] I have espouse you to one husband that I
[5:07] might present you as a Chase virgin to
[5:09] Christ but I fear lest by any means as
[5:12] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[5:14] subtility so your mind should be
[5:17] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[5:20] Christ for he that cometh preacheth
[5:22] another Jesus whom we have not preached
[5:25] or if you receive another Spirit which
[5:28] you have not received or another gospel
[5:30] which you have
[5:32] not accepted you might well bear with
[5:35] him you may be seated the Lord add his
[5:38] Blessing to the reading of the word
[5:43] now as I keep saying we're and we read
[5:47] there in Romans all the time about
[5:50] the the
[5:52] predestination and uh knowing that now
[5:56] in our studies we've got over far enough
[5:58] that we can talk about as we did this
[6:00] past Wednesday about
[6:03] predestination and how that you know
[6:05] we're getting down to the uh Garden of
[6:09] Eden the time of man the creation and
[6:11] things and we can can talk about those
[6:15] things that uh you know are pertaining
[6:18] unto us and we can see then that God
[6:21] does predestinate but how does he
[6:24] predestinate he said he predestinated by
[6:27] for knowledge all right so that's simple
[6:30] for knowledge is God knowing before what
[6:34] would take place upon Earth and if he
[6:36] doesn't know that then why worry about
[6:39] worshiping him what kind of a god do you
[6:41] think you're serving if you if you can't
[6:44] put it all to confidence in him to know
[6:47] all things before the world would ever
[6:49] begin you know and all of that then why
[6:52] would you worry and be in any form or
[6:55] concerned about uh life just go on eat
[6:58] drink and be merried because tomorrow
[7:00] you die but I believe that God who knows
[7:06] all
[7:07] things could before the world look down
[7:09] through time and see who would be saved
[7:11] and who wouldn't be
[7:13] saved so he could predestinate by his
[7:17] full knowledge right then we've covered
[7:19] over and over how that that the the
[7:22] prophet of God covering the message of
[7:25] showing us that for knowledge comes
[7:28] first God doesn't predestinate by his
[7:31] desires because he desired that
[7:33] everybody be saved all right so for
[7:36] knowledge comes before predestination
[7:38] then that way predestination is not a
[7:40] bad word because predestination is
[7:43] Destiny determined
[7:45] beforehand all right looking at it that
[7:47] way we can
[7:48] see that there is nothing happens
[7:52] without God knowing
[7:54] it my way of expressing it is kind of
[7:56] carnal but it gets to point across but
[8:00] see God he never had to go to the moon
[8:03] and be on the moon CU it wouldn't
[8:05] anybody up
[8:06] there but when man first traveled
[8:10] there and back then his journey was
[8:13] there and back with them to record that
[8:16] because that would make him having all
[8:18] of it but he knew before the world what
[8:21] we would be doing in this end time and
[8:23] and and the way things would be all
[8:27] right but then this past Wednesday we
[8:29] got down to coming to the Garden of Eden
[8:33] and talking about what would be
[8:35] happening in the Garden of Eden and then
[8:37] we we picked up to the point that if we
[8:40] can look at something to happen or going
[8:42] on then we can cover
[8:45] predestination we can talk about God
[8:48] forne all things we can see that he did
[8:52] and that he had everything
[8:54] ready you know before mankind
[8:58] came he also had the the point is we was
[9:01] trying to bring out
[9:02] Wednesday he also had the part that uh
[9:06] we don't like to talk about would be the
[9:09] Fallen condition of mankind he knew that
[9:13] if he made Satan Lucifer son of the
[9:16] morning is who he
[9:18] made he knew if he made him that he'd
[9:21] fall he said well then what he do he
[9:23] permitted it to be that way he didn't
[9:25] make him that way he makes no one wrong
[9:28] that's right right we make ourselves
[9:30] wrong that's right see we are the ones
[9:33] when we come to a time of called free
[9:35] moral agency coming to a time of age of
[9:38] accountability uh whatever the words you
[9:40] want to use uh we come to the places
[9:43] that we can start making our own
[9:46] choice and that's where the problem is
[9:49] is when we
[9:50] choose because we a lot of times we
[9:53] choose as as we covered Wednesday we
[9:56] choose off of the tree of knowledge of
[9:57] Good and Evil and and it is a knowledge
[9:59] of Good and Evil it's enough good to be
[10:04] good you know but then it'll be evil to
[10:07] go with it you know I appreciate as I
[10:10] always say I appreciate riding to to
[10:12] church in a in a car I don't want to
[10:15] ride in a wagon and M and wagon you know
[10:18] I appreciate but yet there's more people
[10:20] killed with cars every year than killed
[10:22] in a
[10:23] war so what have we made we've ate off
[10:27] the tree of knowledge and wound up being
[10:29] a scientific world but it's killing
[10:32] everything you know and and and doing
[10:35] that then we don't want to keep eating
[10:37] off of that tree we want to get on to
[10:39] the tree of life because we covered
[10:41] there in Genesis where it talks about
[10:43] there was two trees in the garden one
[10:46] was a tree of life the other one was a
[10:49] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all
[10:52] right now then knowing
[10:55] that God didn't just put those things
[10:57] there by accident
[11:00] you know and why would be he be so
[11:02] specific as to speaking of of calling
[11:06] them
[11:07] trees because in the Bible we we read
[11:09] there you know and talking about in the
[11:12] scriptures where I believe it was balum
[11:15] he called man
[11:17] trees we see we know that because we
[11:20] know that that John was said about him
[11:23] said the ax was laid at the FR at the
[11:24] root of the tree he wasn't talking about
[11:27] cutting down the timber he was talking
[11:29] about the Pharisees and Sadducees the
[11:32] religious leaders of that day all right
[11:36] then man is referred to in the Bible as
[11:39] trees you know walking as as being those
[11:43] trees all right then we know that the
[11:46] tree of
[11:47] life would have to be Jesus
[11:50] Christ all right that's simple that's
[11:52] that's no problem to comprehend a tree
[11:55] of life because Jesus said that he was
[11:57] that tree or he was the bread that came
[12:00] down in the wilderness he was the
[12:03] life so there'd be no problem
[12:05] considering the tree of life being there
[12:08] but who is this tree of knowledge of
[12:10] Good and Evil now if the tree of life
[12:12] was a person which was Christ then the
[12:16] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil would
[12:19] be a person also and that was the person
[12:21] of Satan in his Fallen condition we call
[12:25] him the devil Satan uh he's called many
[12:28] things in the in the scripture and he's
[12:30] called to actually started out as being
[12:32] the anointed cherub he was created
[12:35] perfect in his creation but then he went
[12:39] in his own reasoning because he was
[12:42] given the ability to
[12:45] reason right all right and that ability
[12:49] to reason would make him
[12:51] fall okay now see then he comes to the
[12:55] garden and what does he
[12:57] do what is the first thing he does we'll
[13:00] get more on this afternoon of picking up
[13:03] the point uh of of what took place in
[13:05] the
[13:07] garden and uh I tell you right up front
[13:10] I don't believe they ate an apple and
[13:12] found out they were naked I just never
[13:14] have you know what about 50 years now I
[13:17] haven't believed that uh because if
[13:21] apples make you know your naked then
[13:23] we'll we'll just plant a bunch of apple
[13:25] trees but that's not what lets you know
[13:27] you're naked it's the it's the other
[13:30] parts and all you say well what happened
[13:32] in the garden we we'll get back more on
[13:34] that this afternoon because we've got to
[13:37] see
[13:38] first what happens in the spiritual
[13:41] realm right before the Physical Realm
[13:44] comes into being see and that's way most
[13:46] people would just cover you your
[13:48] physical happening and and tell you this
[13:50] happened and that happened and and all
[13:52] like that but I will tell you this much
[13:54] as I said Wednesday night if man had had
[13:57] have even listened to the Bible in in a
[14:00] sensible way then Darwin wouldn't have
[14:03] had his problem and I'm glad he didn't
[14:06] because it might have caused a lot of
[14:08] other trouble but you remember Darwin
[14:10] brought up the theory of evolution and
[14:12] it this animal evolved Higher and Higher
[14:15] and Higher and Higher and he came to the
[14:17] monkey but when he got to the monkey he
[14:19] couldn't get between the man and the
[14:21] monkey because he could not get the
[14:23] relationship to connect between those
[14:26] two but if he went back in the garden
[14:29] and read there in the Bible he would
[14:31] have found the Bible said that the
[14:32] serpent was the most subst of all Beast
[14:36] right a beast is an upright creature a
[14:38] serpent is a snake or a lizard formed
[14:41] crawling on the ground and if it if
[14:43] Darwin would just known that and
[14:46] remember that Beast could
[14:48] talk it talked to
[14:51] Eve all right so it was not just uh you
[14:54] know some form of doing but the main guy
[14:58] that I want you to deal with we'll get
[15:00] to that this afternoon but the main part
[15:02] I want to deal with is that Satan what
[15:06] caused him to
[15:10] fall he became exalted within his own
[15:14] thinking you would have to say
[15:18] that and he said I'll extend above the
[15:21] clouds I'll be like the most high see he
[15:26] wanted the the he had the ability in
[15:29] heaven to control a lot of things in his
[15:32] creation but then when he was cast out
[15:35] he came to Earth and in that he's began
[15:38] to try to get us to do the same thing
[15:42] that he did is to do
[15:46] what
[15:49] reason reason out
[15:51] things well brother Dale don't you think
[15:53] that it's that it's all right to reason
[15:55] yeah if it's according to the word right
[15:58] cuz the Bible said come let us reason
[16:00] together though your sins be as Scarlet
[16:02] there'll be white as snow that's fine
[16:04] reasoning is fine if it's based upon the
[16:09] word but when it gets off the word we
[16:11] get into our own
[16:13] reasonings all right Satan became
[16:16] exalted in his own thinking and he
[16:19] wanted to take over
[16:20] heaven so what did he
[16:22] do he went out and he be to talk to the
[16:26] angels and the Bible says a third heard
[16:28] of him listen to his reasoning that's
[16:32] right and what was that reasoning
[16:35] about he was trying to show those
[16:39] angels his
[16:41] knowledge his understanding his great
[16:45] wisdom right and and he did he had a
[16:49] great
[16:50] understanding right because of being
[16:53] there when God created the world and and
[16:56] all of the things and and is the prophet
[16:58] said one day he had a knowledge of the
[17:01] principles of
[17:02] life so he knew what was going on on
[17:05] Earth and how it was brought down and
[17:07] and go look at your scientific side of
[17:11] mankind and you'll see that it's
[17:13] constantly in the form of reasoning it
[17:16] says there in Genesis the imagination of
[17:18] man's mind is continually evil now where
[17:22] did he get that
[17:25] from where did he get the evilness from
[17:30] why did it wind up to be
[17:33] that Cain and Abel would be in the
[17:36] garden and they both come to a worship
[17:39] time you've read that in the scriptures
[17:41] you ain't go over to Genesis 1 2 3 4 and
[17:44] all through there and read it and you
[17:46] find
[17:48] that Cain
[17:50] offered his beautiful offering of the
[17:53] flowers the Earth the things and Abel
[17:57] offered the blood of a
[17:59] lamb well Cain got
[18:03] mad right and he wind up killing
[18:07] able the first murder was caused by
[18:11] reasoning
[18:14] knowledge Satan wanted to inroad into
[18:17] Mankind and he got an inroad as we'll
[18:18] get to in a little
[18:20] bit and that inroad is still here today
[18:23] that's why I read that in in Corinthians
[18:26] there Wednesday and read it again today
[18:30] is that Paul would say that let Satan
[18:33] through his
[18:36] subtility deceive us like he did
[18:40] Eve all right so now it had to begin in
[18:44] the garden in some way that would tie
[18:47] together in what Paul is
[18:50] covering and if we'll look at it
[18:52] correctly we'll
[18:55] see but if you you're following the
[18:57] point now now so here in the garden you
[18:59] you see the situation you see Adam and
[19:01] Eve and you see the animals you see
[19:04] everything in perfect
[19:05] order all right and then when you do you
[19:09] see
[19:11] that there's a tree of knowledge of Good
[19:14] and
[19:15] Evil and all at once this
[19:20] Beast upright creature not
[19:23] a monkey dragging his knuckles or a
[19:26] snake crawling on the ground he was made
[19:28] a snake read your Bible off that off
[19:32] your your legs will come off and you'll
[19:35] be on your bedet crawling so he must
[19:37] have walked some other way but he began
[19:40] to talk to Eve he began to reason with
[19:42] her and that was her
[19:44] problem was listening to her
[19:47] reasoning all
[19:49] right you see that's the worst thing in
[19:52] the world but the greatest thing could
[19:54] ever be thought of
[19:56] too as I said on one side if we reason
[19:59] we're like Eve we
[20:01] fall but on the other
[20:05] side God says come let us
[20:08] reason all
[20:10] right as long as we stay on the tree of
[20:13] life which is the word of
[20:16] God we can talk about those things study
[20:19] those things out and all but when we get
[20:21] over onto the tree of knowledge of Good
[20:24] and Evil we wind up like mankind is
[20:26] today and and the world you know and all
[20:29] of the things it's so scientific until
[20:32] you know it's just
[20:34] almost uh unbelievable what mankind can
[20:37] do you know he he he can take you in now
[20:40] and lay you on a bed take this machine
[20:43] and run over
[20:44] you and it just covers everything and
[20:48] and shows every little flaw you've got
[20:50] and and and every little bump you got
[20:53] inside of you or any kind of a a of of a
[20:56] cancer or anything you know
[20:58] that they can just view the whole
[21:01] body you know it's amazing all right but
[21:04] now
[21:07] listen this comes from the Tree of
[21:11] knowledge that we've grown used
[21:15] to all right but in the garden as are
[21:17] saying Wednesday you had the tree of
[21:19] life and the tree of knowledge so it was
[21:21] told at Eve as we'll get back this
[21:23] afternoon that you know Adam and Eve you
[21:27] can eat of every tree in the
[21:29] garden but you can't eat of that tree of
[21:31] knowledge of Good and
[21:33] Evil all right so they were able even to
[21:36] eat of the tree of
[21:38] life because Adam's youth was
[21:40] continually being renewed each day you
[21:43] know his body was not Eternal his his
[21:47] soul is was
[21:49] eternal because God breathed into his
[21:51] nostril he became a living Soul all
[21:54] right but
[21:57] then as we see it we look at that tree
[22:02] there and we see if the tree of life is
[22:05] Jesus Christ and the tree of knowledge
[22:07] of Good and Evil would be
[22:10] Satan and the scripture says there in
[22:12] Ezekiel said talks about the devil and
[22:14] said you was in the garden all right
[22:17] now so now we're watching it come to the
[22:21] point of seeing
[22:24] life and that's what we want to look at
[22:26] this morning
[22:28] to look at life and see it in the
[22:30] correct
[22:32] order
[22:34] because right up here in this part we
[22:36] call the brain the head that's our
[22:41] trouble that's the Avenue that Satan can
[22:45] use to talk to you and I he could even
[22:47] use that to talk to Jesus out there in
[22:49] the
[22:50] desert because he can enter through that
[22:53] realm of
[22:55] reasoning and to try to get us to think
[22:59] about things you ever heard the old
[23:02] isn't it
[23:04] reasonable well that's a good point but
[23:07] most of the time when you say isn't it
[23:10] reasonable is you're going contrary to
[23:13] what is
[23:14] reasonable right you're going to turn
[23:17] away from something that's reasonable to
[23:19] being something that you're reasoning
[23:21] out yourself okay so now think about
[23:26] it we won't cover much about it but Adam
[23:30] in his
[23:33] condition he would not listen to
[23:36] Satan in history of
[23:41] knowledge but Eve
[23:45] did she listened to him all right see
[23:49] Adam was the original
[23:52] creation but Eve was in Adam right and
[23:55] she was taken from Adam if you read your
[23:57] Bible
[23:58] and made him a help meet all
[24:01] right
[24:03] and when you see him then coming into
[24:06] being you see Adam as
[24:09] being the original
[24:12] creation back to Genesis studied a
[24:15] little bit he made male and female he
[24:17] made the dog he made the cat made the
[24:18] horses made the animals you know male
[24:21] and female but then when he come to Adam
[24:23] he only just made a man but he made him
[24:25] male and female that's your Bible read
[24:28] it and when he did he took that feminist
[24:31] part out of Adam and and made Eve so she
[24:35] was not in the original Creation in
[24:39] physical form as the animals were but
[24:43] she was in Adam that was a beautiful
[24:45] place for her to be and as long as she
[24:47] had stayed with what was right there
[24:50] wouldn't have been any
[24:51] trouble because her spiritual
[24:55] being her soul was in
[24:59] Adam all
[25:01] right the prophet says even her theophan
[25:04] soul was in
[25:05] Adam all right
[25:08] now but her physical
[25:11] body was not a body running around
[25:13] inside of
[25:15] Adam it just simply is explaining it so
[25:19] he took a rib from Adam and he made
[25:22] Eve and when he made Eve a free moral
[25:26] agent made Adam one all
[25:29] so remember we don't blame e for
[25:32] everything the Adam of Bible says in
[25:35] Adam all die so you'll find out we had
[25:38] to take our part too all right but now
[25:42] knowing it see we can watch it unfold in
[25:45] the garden what God is
[25:48] doing and how that his original creation
[25:52] can't go wrong you look out at the
[25:55] animals you see them still just like
[25:57] they've always always been male and
[26:00] female but yet because of the Fall you
[26:02] wind up with a with a a polygamy point
[26:05] that come into view and then you wind up
[26:07] with one buck and many
[26:09] Do's but that's still
[26:12] original because of the way they were
[26:14] brought but Eve was made not in an
[26:17] original condition but being in Adam
[26:20] then when she was taken from Adam and
[26:22] her spiritual being taken
[26:24] from Adam and placed within the body
[26:29] she became her own identity person
[26:32] whatever you want to call
[26:35] it but
[26:38] yet when Satan begin to talk to
[26:43] her to bring his
[26:47] knowledge she accepted that
[26:51] knowledge and that's where the trouble
[26:52] is
[26:54] today we hang on the tree of knowledge
[26:58] amen
[27:00] now that's why you have Bible schools
[27:03] that's why you
[27:06] have over a thousand different
[27:08] denominations and
[27:11] beliefs that's why you have close to
[27:14] that many and what's called end time
[27:16] message people you know different ideas
[27:20] and
[27:21] opinions is because of the tree of
[27:24] knowledge of Good and Evil now there
[27:28] wouldn't be but one B one uh
[27:32] church if everybody had the
[27:35] same understanding right that's right
[27:39] but by God permitting us to be able to
[27:43] reason things
[27:45] out then we would wind up being to where
[27:49] we would take our own
[27:51] thoughts instead of God's
[27:54] word all right and doing that then it
[27:57] would cause many many churches to come
[28:00] into being that would differ with each
[28:02] other and we all claim to be going to
[28:05] the same Heaven you know but I guess
[28:08] when we get up there there's going to be
[28:09] a little place for this group and a
[28:10] little place for that one I don't think
[28:14] so but I'm not concerned about that what
[28:17] I'm concerned about is what we
[28:20] read that Satan through his
[28:24] subtility would be able to do in the end
[28:27] time the same thing especially here in
[28:30] the end of it
[28:31] all that he started out in the garden by
[28:34] getting people to
[28:39] reason trying to reason it
[28:44] out we'll say I
[28:48] think
[28:50] right well it's okay if it's according
[28:53] to the
[28:55] word but when we say I think
[28:58] and it doesn't line up with the word
[29:00] then we already to know what tree we're
[29:02] eating off
[29:06] of
[29:07] right because the tree of life there's
[29:11] only one tree of life and that's Jesus
[29:15] Christ there's only one word of
[29:20] God but mankind has Twisted it into
[29:23] every form it could be thought
[29:25] of until now
[29:27] you you you know people can't even
[29:29] hardly trust the reading of the
[29:33] Bible why because they got their own
[29:36] ideas I
[29:38] think see now you show me where we got a
[29:42] right to
[29:45] think you said but now wait a minute now
[29:48] we're supposed to be no Christians have
[29:52] no rights whatsoever right we give up
[29:55] our rights to accept Jesus Christ
[29:59] am our rights and our things is our
[30:02] problems because that's the tree of
[30:04] knowledge of Good and
[30:06] Evil that's come by
[30:10] Satan talking to you and
[30:12] I you say well he's not too powerful he
[30:15] can't well he was powerful enough till
[30:17] he offered Jesus the whole world and all
[30:20] of the governments and the things
[30:23] and he said I'll give it to you if you
[30:25] fall down worship me that's right
[30:29] well see then off of that tree of
[30:33] knowledge God knew that if he gave us
[30:36] the ability he knew first as I said
[30:39] Wednesday if he gave Satan the ability
[30:42] Satan would fall for
[30:44] it if he gave him free moral agency he'd
[30:47] fall for it he knew if we were placed on
[30:49] free moral agency we would fall for
[30:52] it because we begin to
[30:56] reason and can't you see that
[30:59] beautiful little girl walking around in
[31:01] the
[31:02] garden you know what about a beautiful
[31:05] place a Utopia you you know or something
[31:08] you'd call it no problems no the animals
[31:12] were there no
[31:14] problems dinosaurs were in the garden
[31:16] you cannot annihilate those things
[31:20] because they got enough bones to put
[31:21] together to show you they were
[31:23] somewhere all right so all of that was
[31:25] there but no problem the line was there
[31:27] the tiger was there the bar was
[31:30] there but there was no problem why
[31:33] because sin had not come into being all
[31:37] right but what about a beautiful little
[31:39] girl that's that said she's in the
[31:41] garden and you know her and
[31:45] Adam and they're having a wonderful
[31:48] time cuz time is not counted back there
[31:52] so they wouldn't aging they wouldn't go
[31:54] older you know they were just having a
[31:56] good time
[31:58] but yet here come the
[32:02] devil Satan and he begins to try to get
[32:06] to
[32:07] Eve cuz he knows he can't get
[32:10] Adam but he gets to Eve and he begins to
[32:13] get her to
[32:16] reason don't you
[32:19] think and what if she said now she done
[32:22] a good
[32:23] job she told him that we're able to eat
[32:27] of every tree that's in the
[32:29] garden we said we're not able to eat off
[32:32] that tree of
[32:33] knowledge like I said we get to it more
[32:36] this afternoon but that's a funny
[32:38] looking tree I I've never seen an apple
[32:40] tree where it said underneath the bottom
[32:43] of it a sign and said this is the tree
[32:45] of knowledge if you you get a belly a
[32:48] from eating apples you don't get
[32:51] knowledge all right and see then when
[32:54] you come down to it then that tree of
[32:58] knowledge was Satan reasoning with Eve
[33:01] and she began to listen to
[33:04] him she began to take what he was
[33:09] saying and he was telling her
[33:12] said you can do this you she said no no
[33:15] no
[33:16] no as long as she stayed with that word
[33:18] everything was okay so she started out
[33:21] telling him no no no we can't do this we
[33:24] can eat of every tree in the Garden but
[33:28] this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[33:30] we can't eat of that because we do God
[33:33] has said we'll
[33:36] die well all satan said was is you shall
[33:39] not surely
[33:42] die
[33:44] right right just a little simple point
[33:47] that he brought in and she began to
[33:51] reason she began to
[33:54] listen to what he was saying
[34:00] how far how far off are we
[34:05] today in our
[34:09] listening it wouldn't be any problem
[34:13] preaching if everybody had the same
[34:15] thoughts that's right but we're human
[34:18] beings we're permitted to the right to
[34:21] think I said
[34:24] permitted God allowed us to think out
[34:30] things but see what does the word
[34:34] say if the word says that there's one
[34:39] God then where would we have any right
[34:41] to think about well I think it's a
[34:45] trinity now that's the devil's lie cuz
[34:47] there's no Trinity in the Bible it's not
[34:50] there it's not
[34:54] nothing but yet we think that we have a
[34:56] right right to reason things
[35:00] out see that's what what happened in the
[35:03] garden when you come to Cain and
[35:06] Abel Cain reasoned it
[35:09] out he thought mama ate an
[35:12] apple or fruit or some form so he works
[35:16] like everything a good
[35:18] man worked day in and day out and raised
[35:21] a garden a crop trees of you
[35:25] know
[35:27] and he brought an offering that was
[35:30] beautiful and God rejected
[35:33] it and they said well to go then he gets
[35:36] all mad because Abel tells him
[35:39] said now
[35:42] listen mom and daddy didn't eat no
[35:46] apple said you're born in your blood
[35:49] from your Mom and Daddy's blood blood
[35:52] coming from the
[35:53] daddy said you're born that way
[35:57] well Kain just got all tore up about
[36:01] it if you want to get people upset with
[36:04] you cross their
[36:06] Doctrine right just cross what they
[36:11] think and you'll see them raise up yeah
[36:15] but and then they'll say to you know you
[36:17] do to me I know I I don't have to have
[36:20] discernment I read I look at faces
[36:23] enough a lot of times here and say he's
[36:25] saying I don't agree with that well come
[36:28] and show me where I'm off the
[36:31] word and if I ain't off the word then
[36:33] what right are you got to think any
[36:35] other
[36:36] way right that's why I preach as hard as
[36:40] I do with a challenge to you if you can
[36:42] see see that I'm off the word come to me
[36:46] and tell me about it don't go tell
[36:47] everybody else cuz I ain't helping
[36:51] nothing all right but even she begins to
[36:55] reason
[36:59] and in her reasoning
[37:01] doing it put a situation into
[37:05] mankind that we say is lost or situation
[37:08] no you
[37:10] know and if we keep on reasoning
[37:14] folks those say goes we going to die
[37:17] right I mean that's just plain language
[37:19] right we going to die why because we're
[37:22] still eating off that tree of knowledge
[37:24] right but if we lay that down and take
[37:26] the word of God yes
[37:30] sir now I've never been one that tried
[37:33] to make you believe
[37:36] anything I've never been one to even try
[37:38] to make my wife or my kids uh grandkids
[37:41] and great grandkids coming on now I've
[37:44] never tried to make you believe
[37:48] anything all I've asked you to do is
[37:51] just pray
[37:53] am and read your Bible right
[37:57] and see what it says right if I tell you
[38:01] what it says then there's no problem
[38:03] with it
[38:06] right now if I lie to
[38:09] you but you see that's up to
[38:12] you I I've never worried about preaching
[38:15] because of one
[38:17] thing it's up to
[38:20] you to keep your end of the line
[38:24] straight you can reason all you want
[38:27] too but you better remember one thing
[38:30] you're going to have to come back to the
[38:34] word see wasn't it reasonable there in
[38:37] the garden I mean there in the The
[38:39] Temptations of the Lord
[38:41] Jesus he said make these stones to bread
[38:44] you're
[38:45] hungry that was reasonable cuz he
[38:49] was he told him said get behind
[38:53] me why because he was getting all for
[38:55] the thing
[38:58] he could have turned that stones into
[39:03] bread but yet he wouldn't go to let it
[39:06] be a reasonable
[39:08] Factor he said it is
[39:11] written Now Eve told the
[39:15] Beast the serpent the snake the things
[39:17] you want to call it whatever you want to
[39:19] bring it he could talk and it did Eve
[39:22] told him
[39:24] said we can't eat of that
[39:27] tree if we do we'll
[39:31] die Satan through his subtility begin to
[39:34] talk to her and say now God loves
[39:38] you you he's not going to kill
[39:43] you you know no no no he's not going to
[39:47] do that he's going to he he loves you
[39:49] too much to
[39:54] do but yet
[39:58] he did she did
[40:00] die all right reasonable
[40:04] factors see we go back and learn
[40:08] reason it says the day you eat thereof
[40:11] that day you'll
[40:13] die
[40:15] well she
[40:19] ate and the devil said see you're not
[40:24] dead right
[40:27] that added more reasoning to her
[40:30] reasoning said you're not
[40:33] dead but see the Bible says a th000
[40:36] years the day and the day is a th
[40:38] years no man's ever lived the oldest man
[40:41] is meusel 969 years all right no man's
[40:45] ever lived to be a thousand years old
[40:49] yet all right see then we reason Eve
[40:52] could reason and say but I didn't die I
[40:55] ate it I didn't die
[40:56] Adam said eve you're wrong to do that I
[40:59] didn't
[41:04] die see there's
[41:07] reasoning without taking the Bible to be
[41:10] the answer to all things
[41:13] right we want to reason it upon our
[41:16] abilities to think things out to make it
[41:19] look more
[41:23] beautiful
[41:25] right you see Satan's approach to
[41:29] Eve was through the ability to get her
[41:32] to
[41:35] reason get her to think about some
[41:38] things all
[41:40] right now let's just read a little
[41:45] bit we believe God sent a
[41:48] prophet but I make it plain to you I
[41:52] always make it plain to everybody I
[41:54] don't believe the man was God right
[41:57] right
[42:00] no don't believe that we don't have no
[42:02] such thing but yet there is followers of
[42:04] this message around the country that
[42:06] believe he's
[42:08] God well he died so that order took all
[42:12] that out but that's all right he got
[42:14] killed and a car wrecked but that didn't
[42:16] solve that they're still believing it
[42:18] why because they're still eating off the
[42:19] tree of knowledge of Good and
[42:21] Evil all right we believe that God was
[42:25] promised in his word to send us a
[42:26] prophet Malachi
[42:28] 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations
[42:32] 10:7 days are the voice of the seventh
[42:34] angel when he begins to sound the
[42:36] mysteries of God would be finished as he
[42:38] have declared to his servants the
[42:40] prophets I believe
[42:43] that but I also believe one thing that I
[42:47] wish I could talk to everybody that
[42:49] claims to be the followers of the
[42:50] message about it it's fine to say what
[42:53] brother Brown
[42:55] said but you could kill yourself doing
[42:59] that I'm going to show it in just a
[43:01] minute here in the
[43:03] quote because you reason out what he's
[43:05] saying and you're going to
[43:11] die why because he was a human mortal
[43:14] that spoke as human
[43:18] Mortals but yet the message he
[43:22] brought is perfect but yet the human man
[43:26] himself was
[43:27] not the message he brought to us I
[43:30] wanted i' I've spent all of my time
[43:32] almost 50 years
[43:35] now showing people to where the things
[43:38] are not
[43:39] incorrect we just need to wait a little
[43:41] while
[43:43] amen and God will reveal it to
[43:46] us all
[43:49] right but you see
[43:51] then by
[43:53] sin originating in or Heaven as we call
[43:58] it Satan in his disbelieving when he
[44:02] came down he started get Eve to
[44:04] disbelieve and when he did he brought
[44:06] her to a
[44:07] state and I want you to think about
[44:10] it not just women now but I want you to
[44:13] think about all
[44:16] mankind see one when truth is presented
[44:20] to you what is the first
[44:25] reaction
[44:27] when truth is presented to you what's
[44:28] your first reaction I don't believe that
[44:31] that's right right that's
[44:34] right why because the word of God is not
[44:38] the tree of
[44:43] knowledge as I said you go in the Bible
[44:45] and you find out knowledge is only used
[44:47] where it says knowledge puffeth up but
[44:50] you look the rest of it up and run the
[44:51] word knowledge it has a lot of good
[44:53] meaning to
[44:54] it
[44:56] why because we need the knowledge of
[44:59] God we need understanding of God we need
[45:02] the
[45:03] truth but think about it now in your own
[45:05] Sal what's the first thing that happens
[45:07] when somebody presents something to you
[45:09] that you're not accustomed to you
[45:12] haven't heard it I don't believe
[45:16] that right I mean we all done
[45:19] it come
[45:21] on but see then after a while you begin
[45:24] to read
[45:27] and you begin to see
[45:30] hey that's
[45:34] true but yet still in the human
[45:38] mind see God lives in a realm called
[45:44] faith we live in a realm called
[45:50] reality the Bible said it was revealed
[45:53] unto
[45:54] Abel
[45:57] all
[45:58] right but it doesn't say it was revealed
[46:00] under
[46:03] Cain there's a lot of difference in a
[46:05] revelation and a natural head
[46:10] knowledge all right so then when it
[46:13] comes down
[46:14] that we see Mankind in the way he's made
[46:19] and what he
[46:22] is as I said to start with then your
[46:24] battle starts right here
[46:29] now irregardless of what you think about
[46:32] how great a revelation you got remember
[46:35] it started in your
[46:37] head no it was in my heart how did it
[46:42] get
[46:46] there the Bible says faith cometh by
[46:51] what hearing and hearing by the word of
[46:55] God
[46:58] so it's the best to go back somebody
[46:59] talks to you about something and you you
[47:01] look at it and you say well I don't see
[47:03] that well I don't just throw it
[47:05] away take it and sit down and
[47:09] read you know and the basic thing too is
[47:12] to ask somebody said well where's it in
[47:14] the Bible Well I I can't find it but
[47:17] it's in there
[47:22] well you might have the wrong idea too
[47:26] you know
[47:27] what get a Bible and start reading it
[47:29] that's why I love for people to read the
[47:32] scriptures I love for you to read the
[47:36] Bible cuz in that you'll find a lot of
[47:41] things but you see just to look at a
[47:44] natural person that's why that we've
[47:46] covered it when God made the animals and
[47:49] things see the animal has a spiritual
[47:52] part of his life he can do certain
[47:55] amount of reasonings
[47:57] Etc but he still goes right on building
[48:00] the same bird nest that he built 4,000
[48:03] 6,000 years
[48:05] ago it doesn't change we mankind have
[48:08] taken them and got dogs to talk and
[48:11] horses to count and everything else but
[48:14] pigs to run to the right stall but it's
[48:16] all on account of feeding and petting
[48:18] and and stuff like that that you train
[48:20] them uh you can't just walk up to a dog
[48:22] and say hello dog how you doing
[48:28] well ain't you going to talk to me no
[48:32] they can't do
[48:34] that that's the part of the human being
[48:36] that were that
[48:39] what man has a
[48:42] soul within
[48:44] him and that soul is the is the ability
[48:48] to do a lot of
[48:51] things look at mankind as I said a while
[48:53] ago and what they've done with the fact
[48:55] of being able to think things
[48:57] out see I talk to the soul of the
[49:00] individuals not to your body and your
[49:02] spirit because your body and your spirit
[49:05] is that's just part of you but the real
[49:07] part is the inward part of you whether
[49:09] you're saved or lost the Soul at in the
[49:12] individual is the real
[49:16] you but yet let's look at a Mankind and
[49:20] see what he is go ahead pull up number
[49:22] seven brother uh Anderson glad to have
[49:25] brother Anderson back he was out in
[49:27] California for a while and uh we missed
[49:32] him done a lot of juggling to the books
[49:34] in the back room to get everything to
[49:36] where they could run their internet
[49:37] system but look at number
[49:40] seven I'd invite you to read the message
[49:43] called the greatest battle ever fought
[49:45] over and over and over and over and over
[49:48] and then read it again right because
[49:51] that's what I do with the Bible but
[49:53] let's think about Mankind now now to see
[49:56] what approach Satan can use upon you and
[49:59] I and it's used the seventh grade
[50:01] education man to explain it to us all
[50:04] right let's look at paragraph 68 when
[50:06] this great battle started on Earth there
[50:09] had to be a mutual meeting place there
[50:12] had to be a place selected for the
[50:13] battle to begin and for the battle to
[50:14] rage and that Battle Ground begins in
[50:17] the human
[50:19] mind the human mind there is where the
[50:22] battle starts the human mind was chosen
[50:24] for the place of the battle where it was
[50:27] began and that is because that decisions
[50:30] are made from the mind the head all
[50:33] right
[50:35] now the
[50:37] mind the
[50:40] head I like the way the prophet will
[50:42] explain things because we use the words
[50:45] as we want to and when he'll say
[50:48] something he'll say the mind we see a
[50:51] lot of people Jo I got the mind of
[50:53] Christ well you don't have have the mind
[50:55] of Christ if you're not born again and
[50:57] you still don't have the head of Christ
[50:59] you can call old head you want to and
[51:00] say he's my head all you want to but
[51:02] that old head of your still running like
[51:04] mine right it's a bunch of garbage
[51:08] can your human brain ain't nothing but a
[51:11] uh highly Technical Machine anyway
[51:13] because it it's just the greatest
[51:16] computer could ever be as a human brain
[51:18] CU it never been a computer if it have
[51:20] been a human brain for for it to work
[51:22] with all right but think about it now to
[51:25] see ision are made in the mind so where
[51:28] did he attack
[51:31] Eve with reasoning in her mind her
[51:35] head all right now being the head
[51:41] part let's go on down this little bit
[51:43] brother go on paragraph
[51:45] 72 cuz I like the way a simple
[51:48] terminology man can explain
[51:51] things really don't
[51:54] know
[51:56] Bring It On Up paragraph 72 number eight
[52:00] all right now if you'll sit down when
[52:02] you get
[52:05] home and you draw three little
[52:09] rings you'll find out that the outside
[52:12] body has five senses is contacted by
[52:15] that c taste feel smelling here that's
[52:18] your body see you you got that to
[52:20] contact the world all right that's the
[52:22] five senses that controls the human body
[52:26] all right now what's inside of the body
[52:28] is a
[52:29] soul and we're going to show something
[52:31] in a minute so hold on to that all
[52:33] right and that soul is controlled
[52:37] by the second realm of man is controlled
[52:40] by
[52:42] what imagination conscience memory
[52:45] reason
[52:48] affections so you don't love with your
[52:50] body you display love with your body you
[52:52] love with your
[52:53] spirit all right now
[52:56] now but the spirit is only has one sense
[53:00] the spirit let's get it the spirit has
[53:02] one sense and that sense is either
[53:04] dominates it is Faith or doubt all right
[53:08] that's exactly there's only one Avenue
[53:10] to it that's free moral agency you can
[53:13] accept doubt or you can accept Faith
[53:15] either one you want to therefore Satan
[53:18] begin at the principle part to cause the
[53:20] spirit of man to doubt God's word God
[53:24] begins to get a to straighten it up all
[53:27] right the three Realms of
[53:34] man outside body C taste feel smelling
[53:38] here inside of the man in the second
[53:40] realm is memory reason conscience
[53:44] factions imaginations Etc right second
[53:48] real of man the Third Realm of man is
[53:51] the center part of you and I which is
[53:53] either Faith or doubt
[53:56] if we're lost it's doubt if we're born
[53:58] again it's
[53:59] Faith right if you're saved it's faith
[54:03] if you're lost it's
[54:05] doubt so that's the the reasoning
[54:07] factors are part of
[54:10] mankind
[54:13] now to just show you how that
[54:16] even we
[54:20] are let's bring some something up right
[54:24] here
[54:26] because as I
[54:27] said Satan tries to get us to
[54:32] reason that's his ability is to make us
[54:35] reason you say I don't reason brother
[54:37] Dale I live by
[54:41] faith well pray for the rest of the
[54:43] world cuz you're the only
[54:45] one that's doing that rest of the worlds
[54:49] living in a realm here that we live
[54:51] every day you know every day we live off
[54:53] of sea taste Feld smell in here right
[54:57] that's your contact that's what you're
[54:58] doing right now the second realm of the
[55:01] individual is memory reason conscience
[55:04] affections and things and in
[55:10] that is where that we start
[55:13] our part of
[55:18] understanding but then there's a realm
[55:20] of mankind which is the center
[55:22] realm that as I said has Faith or doubt
[55:25] out to
[55:26] it one or the other it's it'll dominate
[55:29] us it's Faith or doubt all right see
[55:33] Satan can get us to reason where's that
[55:37] at you don't reason with your
[55:41] brain your brain is I said just a highly
[55:44] mechanized computer system of a bunch of
[55:46] cells and things that don't ask me how
[55:48] it works and science don't even know
[55:50] that works but they still know it works
[55:52] I know it works too cuz I'm looking at
[55:54] it all
[55:56] right see Tes field smelling here is
[55:59] just your Earthly
[56:02] realm well Satan didn't have to bother
[56:05] with
[56:08] that that came later as to the body
[56:11] bringing into being the things he went
[56:15] straight to the second
[56:18] real of
[56:20] mankind which is memory reason conscious
[56:23] affections
[56:26] Etc and he began to try to get Eve to
[56:32] reason as he did he he got contact with
[56:39] her all
[56:41] right it's impossible to do wrong with a
[56:45] body the Bible says a body is without
[56:48] the spirit is dead that's right right I
[56:52] mean this body you say well you know
[56:55] my body I do no you don't love with your
[56:59] body you display love with your body
[57:02] amen you got to love with the second
[57:05] realm which is the spirit realm of
[57:07] mankind are the reasoning
[57:10] factors all
[57:13] right if not then why is it that you hit
[57:16] a man in the head and the body's
[57:18] paralyze and that takes care of
[57:22] him he's laying there totally paralyzed
[57:25] can't do
[57:27] anything
[57:29] right but he can still
[57:33] think his memory reason conscious and
[57:36] things is still working
[57:38] right see there's where Satan
[57:42] attacks he attacks in that second real
[57:45] of
[57:47] mankind to get us to reason upon the
[57:49] word of God that's
[57:52] right but yet is the same thing as I've
[57:54] said
[57:56] that we when somebody contacts us we say
[58:00] they present something to us we don't
[58:02] have understood before haven't seen
[58:04] before a new
[58:05] doctrine his man would
[58:08] say we say well I don't believe that but
[58:12] how come it is after a while something
[58:14] that I said you begin to read for
[58:16] yourself that's right and study and
[58:19] think it out and as you do you come to a
[58:23] place that you say
[58:26] well you
[58:27] know there's no other way it can be than
[58:29] what that brother told
[58:31] me you
[58:33] know I mean he told me the right way to
[58:35] be baptized is in the name of the Lord
[58:37] Jesus
[58:38] Christ he said all of my life we've been
[58:40] taught it was Father Son and Holy
[58:44] Ghost see but that's reasoning cuz I can
[58:48] show you in your encyclopedia just go
[58:49] home and read
[58:52] it you show me in the Bible anywhere
[58:55] that anybody was baptized father son
[58:57] Holy
[58:58] Ghost I've offered $110,000 for
[59:04] that you say you're a smart e no I ain't
[59:07] a smart etic I'm
[59:11] sincere my whole life is built on
[59:13] whether the word of God is true or not
[59:15] amen I don't know what you think that's
[59:17] right and if it's true I want everything
[59:19] put behind
[59:21] it
[59:22] right but you see in the Bible they
[59:25] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ or
[59:27] Lord Jesus Christ the Catholic Church
[59:30] came along and about 3:25 ad they begin
[59:33] to talk about it it developed by
[59:36] 606 that's in your history at the Nan
[59:38] Council they begin to get the mood of
[59:41] baptism to Father Son and Holy
[59:44] Ghost right we're not the only group of
[59:47] people in the end time that baptized in
[59:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[59:51] got a lot of Pentecostal people today or
[59:53] has been doing that ever since back in
[59:55] the in the beginnings that back in the
[59:56] 30s and all the 40s they become to
[59:59] developing from the Oneness idea coming
[1:00:02] on over to the uh some of the other
[1:00:05] churches and they baptized in the name
[1:00:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ we're not the
[1:00:08] only little group of people there's
[1:00:11] plenty of people out there in
[1:00:12] denominational churches that's been
[1:00:14] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:15] Christ but most of them are baptized
[1:00:18] father son Holy Ghost why because they
[1:00:21] reasoned it
[1:00:22] out but the words tell us what to
[1:00:26] do see if we're reasoning then it's not
[1:00:29] according to God's
[1:00:31] word so since somebody present something
[1:00:33] to
[1:00:34] you you say well I don't I don't I don't
[1:00:37] believe
[1:00:38] that but then you go read a while and
[1:00:41] then something happens and you
[1:00:44] say well you
[1:00:49] know irregardless of what I think about
[1:00:52] those
[1:00:53] people you
[1:00:55] know they're telling me the truth right
[1:00:59] see you've got into the reasoning
[1:01:04] factors you got into the ability to
[1:01:06] think things out for
[1:01:09] yourself but most people you know they
[1:01:11] say well I was baptized this way and I'm
[1:01:14] going to stay this way okay go
[1:01:18] ahead I ain't trying to convince you of
[1:01:20] nothing I'm just
[1:01:23] illustrating
[1:01:25] of what I'm talking about the reasoning
[1:01:27] factor of the of the devil just
[1:01:29] illustrating in a common little form to
[1:01:32] us to think
[1:01:34] about God's word is the only thing
[1:01:37] that's
[1:01:39] reasonable ain't nothing else
[1:01:43] reasonable you think that they're crazy
[1:01:46] in the medical realm I was reading here
[1:01:48] the other day I probably told you about
[1:01:50] it but somewhere around 4,000 years ago
[1:01:54] they was already Drilling holdes in
[1:01:56] people's head to try to let them the
[1:01:58] pressure off is what they were doing but
[1:02:01] they thought there was devils in there
[1:02:02] that got in there and they drill holes
[1:02:04] in the people's head to try to you know
[1:02:07] George Washington's today they get sick
[1:02:10] what they do pluck your toenails and
[1:02:13] your fingernails and bleed your
[1:02:14] pint killed a lot of people but that was
[1:02:18] a tree of knowledge you know what a lot
[1:02:19] of people got better because the body
[1:02:22] started supplying more blood cells and
[1:02:24] things you know all right you think they
[1:02:27] do that
[1:02:29] now you know
[1:02:32] no you see they they've learned too much
[1:02:36] all right but it's about time we've
[1:02:38] learned
[1:02:38] something the word of God is either
[1:02:41] right or
[1:02:41] wrong it's right let's believe it if
[1:02:44] it's wrong let's get away from
[1:02:46] it and if the word of God cannot be kept
[1:02:49] correctly let's eat drink and be merry
[1:02:51] CU what are we worried about it right
[1:02:55] you
[1:02:57] know why are you concerned about
[1:03:01] it if you don't believe the word of God
[1:03:03] Is
[1:03:06] Right W worry about anything else go
[1:03:09] live like the
[1:03:10] devil why because there is no God
[1:03:13] evidently if he can't keep his word
[1:03:16] straight but see if we do believe he is
[1:03:18] and we have something something within
[1:03:20] us that that leans to the point of of
[1:03:23] Desire iring to learn the
[1:03:27] truth and thank God for that desire that
[1:03:31] thought you know and it'll bring a lot
[1:03:34] of things into
[1:03:37] being but you see we try to reason that
[1:03:40] part
[1:03:42] out and as Eve you begin to reason with
[1:03:47] Satan and if you got a scoffield
[1:03:50] Bible there where it's talking to the
[1:03:53] Beast
[1:03:56] look down there and read it scofi is I
[1:03:59] don't go all with scofi but it is a good
[1:04:03] point he had a little
[1:04:06] knowledge you know
[1:04:09] what let's see if I can find it in a
[1:04:14] hurry I just wanted to read you what
[1:04:16] little knowledge Scofield
[1:04:23] had
[1:04:24] he said the serpent in his adamic
[1:04:29] form
[1:04:30] listen is not thought to be of as a w
[1:04:35] you know wiggling ring
[1:04:38] reptile that is the effect of the curse
[1:04:40] from
[1:04:42] Genesis the creature which lent itself
[1:04:45] to Satan May well have been the most
[1:04:47] beautiful as it was the most subtile of
[1:04:51] creatures less than
[1:04:53] man traces of that beauty remain despite
[1:04:56] the
[1:04:59] curse every movement of a serpent is
[1:05:04] graceful and in many species are
[1:05:06] beautifully
[1:05:07] colored and that's what a author is
[1:05:14] writing the Scofield bible is not done
[1:05:17] by scoffield you know he didn't write it
[1:05:20] he he he just took the King James and
[1:05:22] began to expound upon it
[1:05:25] all right so that Beast was not a snake
[1:05:30] it was made a
[1:05:32] snake all right so we can look at that
[1:05:34] and say hey that's
[1:05:37] reasonable you understand what I just
[1:05:41] done I just done what I was saying that
[1:05:43] I've been trying to preach about
[1:05:45] doing is to take your mind and to show
[1:05:48] you
[1:05:49] that see when you first think about it
[1:05:52] you said no I don't believe that
[1:05:54] but then somebody reads something simple
[1:05:56] to you or Express something simple to
[1:05:59] you and then you begin to move into a
[1:06:02] realm of thinking well you
[1:06:07] know they've got a
[1:06:09] point let me bear with this a little
[1:06:11] while and see what goes
[1:06:13] on all
[1:06:15] right but listen let me get this point
[1:06:20] right here in while I'm on the
[1:06:22] thought and and then this afternoon
[1:06:24] we'll pick back up with the other but
[1:06:27] remember Eve began to
[1:06:32] reason
[1:06:35] okay
[1:06:37] now I just read
[1:06:39] you from the screen you out on
[1:06:43] internet and in
[1:06:45] 1962
[1:06:47] 311 1962 was the greatest battle ever
[1:06:50] fought priest in Jeffersonville
[1:06:52] Indiana that the prophet Prophet was
[1:06:54] explaining the three Realms of
[1:06:58] man and he explains them as the first
[1:07:02] Rim the body see taste feel smelling
[1:07:04] here the second real the
[1:07:09] soul but he says it's got five senses
[1:07:11] memory reason conscience affections Etc
[1:07:14] did you read
[1:07:16] that then he said then the spirit of man
[1:07:19] is the center of man all
[1:07:22] right
[1:07:24] that's the five senses that control the
[1:07:26] body c tast f all right inside the body
[1:07:29] is a
[1:07:30] soul and the soul is controlled by
[1:07:32] imagination conscious memory reason
[1:07:35] affections that's the things that
[1:07:37] controls the soul are you looking at
[1:07:39] it right but then the spirit has only
[1:07:41] one
[1:07:43] sense so he's saying Body Soul
[1:07:49] Spirit okay now I got a bunch of them
[1:07:51] written down here but we won't use them
[1:07:52] all so brother
[1:07:55] uh Anderson to save
[1:07:58] trouble jump all the way to
[1:08:00] 21 going to be hard to
[1:08:04] do now
[1:08:07] remember this is one realm this is one
[1:08:10] Rim this is one Rim
[1:08:14] Body Soul
[1:08:18] Spirit
[1:08:21] okay now look what he's going to say
[1:08:26] this is taken from leadership 1965
[1:08:29] 1207 now look here you are an outside
[1:08:31] person you have five senses that control
[1:08:34] the outside body God gave you five
[1:08:36] senses to contact him you're EXC not
[1:08:39] excuse me five censes not to contact him
[1:08:42] your Earthly it's your Earthly home you
[1:08:44] contact see tast feel smelling here then
[1:08:46] you have a spirit on inside of that it
[1:08:49] has five
[1:08:51] Outlets conscience love so forth five
[1:08:54] Outlets that you contact the spirit
[1:08:56] world with that but with your spirit
[1:08:58] your physical contacts are physical your
[1:09:01] spiritual contacts are spiritual but
[1:09:03] inside of that you've got a soul and
[1:09:05] that soul is that Gene that come from
[1:09:08] God all right so now here
[1:09:12] is
[1:09:16] reasoning I gave you two
[1:09:19] quotes one reading contrary to the other
[1:09:22] one seemingly
[1:09:27] so now you're going to reason that
[1:09:29] out you know what you're going to reason
[1:09:31] with you're going to reason it with
[1:09:34] whatever you
[1:09:39] want because you believe that your soul
[1:09:42] is the second real and your spirit is
[1:09:45] the center you're going to reason that
[1:09:47] you believe that your spirit is the
[1:09:49] second rim and your soul is the center
[1:09:51] Rim you're going to reason with that
[1:09:58] that's what I don't understand about the
[1:09:59] people of the message they've tried to
[1:10:00] find so many contrary things seemingly
[1:10:03] in the message but they don't even
[1:10:04] really go after the
[1:10:07] truth that's it
[1:10:10] amen I'm just making a
[1:10:16] point you say well which one's right
[1:10:18] brother Dale both of
[1:10:22] them
[1:10:24] you just ain't reading
[1:10:27] right you're in Satan's lie and
[1:10:31] listening to him reason with your
[1:10:33] factors that's
[1:10:37] right up until about 65 brother random
[1:10:40] taught
[1:10:41] it Body Soul
[1:10:44] Spirit then he changed and he taught
[1:10:46] Body Spirit and
[1:10:50] soul and you know he was correct both
[1:10:52] times you say how could that be because
[1:10:55] you don't understand go in the Bible and
[1:10:58] run the word soul and show me the
[1:11:00] difference between the soul of man or
[1:11:02] the soul of God or take the word spirit
[1:11:04] and run it to see whether there's a
[1:11:05] difference in the word spirit for God or
[1:11:07] the word spirit for man the only way you
[1:11:10] can Define it is to find out what it's
[1:11:12] talking
[1:11:13] about
[1:11:15] right when you find out what it's
[1:11:17] talking about then you can Define it
[1:11:20] right all
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:25] so then the prophet was defining it as
[1:11:27] Body Soul and Spirit then he was
[1:11:30] defining it as body spirit and soul but
[1:11:34] my Point's always been one
[1:11:36] thing see a revelation will bring it all
[1:11:38] together and you'll say that he wasn't
[1:11:40] wrong and didn't have to correct
[1:11:42] it why because he always gave realm
[1:11:46] number one see taste feel smell and
[1:11:50] hear real number two no matter matter
[1:11:53] what he called it he gave it memory
[1:11:56] reason conscience
[1:11:59] affections realm number three he always
[1:12:02] gave it one sense Faith or
[1:12:07] doubt now you got it together you don't
[1:12:09] have to tear up the message and throw it
[1:12:14] away but see then when you get into the
[1:12:16] doctrines of the people of the message
[1:12:18] with the two Soul Doctrine people they
[1:12:21] quoted a lot of old tapes
[1:12:24] as
[1:12:26] soul and trying to make that to CER Rim
[1:12:29] when brother rner was making it to
[1:12:30] Second R so it corrected a lot of
[1:12:34] things if you'll just simply
[1:12:37] read it like reading the Bible in the
[1:12:40] basis of read the
[1:12:42] Bible the Bible says in Matthew 28:19
[1:12:46] the Lord Jesus told him to go baptize in
[1:12:49] the name of the father and of the son
[1:12:51] and of the Holy Ghost right
[1:12:54] that's Matthew 2819 that's
[1:12:58] Bible a few days later Peter is standing
[1:13:01] on the day of
[1:13:05] Pentecost and they said men and Brethren
[1:13:07] what must we do to be saved Peter said
[1:13:09] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:13:11] in the name of Jesus
[1:13:12] Christ for the remission of sins and
[1:13:16] then you read all the way through the
[1:13:17] Bible that they use Lord Jesus or Jesus
[1:13:20] Christ and they never use Father Son and
[1:13:22] Holy Ghost till they Catholic Church
[1:13:24] come along later and started using
[1:13:27] it why would those disciples in direct
[1:13:31] Disobedience to what Jesus had said why
[1:13:34] would they not baptize Father Son and
[1:13:36] Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost they
[1:13:41] did they
[1:13:43] did cuz when you baptize in the name of
[1:13:46] the Lord Jesus Christ you're baptizing
[1:13:48] Father Son and Holy Ghost father son
[1:13:51] Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:56] that's simple ain't
[1:14:00] it but you see our wisdom will make it
[1:14:02] go to what we want that's right yeah but
[1:14:05] the Catholic Church they're thousands of
[1:14:07] years old and and you know they got the
[1:14:09] truth
[1:14:10] well go with it
[1:14:13] right forget it but if something bothers
[1:14:17] you amen that's it about that that you
[1:14:21] read one thing here and you read this
[1:14:22] here
[1:14:27] if it does in the message people as who
[1:14:29] I'm talking to now if you read something
[1:14:31] that sounds contrary one to the other
[1:14:34] sit down and think about it amen you
[1:14:36] might find
[1:14:38] out that is
[1:14:41] right but you might also find the devil
[1:14:44] in his reasoning
[1:14:46] ability has tried to bring you to a
[1:14:49] place to where you can't accept
[1:14:52] truth
[1:14:57] because that's the
[1:14:59] fall see what happened in the garden
[1:15:01] later is just a
[1:15:04] manifestation a physical happening an
[1:15:07] act that took
[1:15:09] place but what happened to Eve first was
[1:15:12] Satan got to her mind and got her to
[1:15:15] reason right that's exactly what's
[1:15:18] happening right here today to you and
[1:15:21] I we're reasoning out things in our
[1:15:26] reasoning factor that our our mind is
[1:15:29] our
[1:15:31] brain but yet our memory reason
[1:15:34] conscious affections and things has to
[1:15:36] work through that brain and that's
[1:15:38] called the spirit realm of
[1:15:42] mankind and see that way you can take
[1:15:44] the message and it's right you can take
[1:15:46] the Bible and it's
[1:15:50] right Paul says that you're justified by
[1:15:55] faith but we read James and it seemed
[1:15:58] like he says we're justified by
[1:16:00] works both of them is
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:05] true CU Paul is talking about what God
[1:16:08] sees of faith and James is talking about
[1:16:13] what man sees or what we see in each
[1:16:15] other so both of them's right see you
[1:16:17] don't have to change the
[1:16:19] Bible or you don't have to read and say
[1:16:21] well that don't sound right to this over
[1:16:22] here
[1:16:24] just sit down there and think about it
[1:16:25] for just a little while you might find
[1:16:28] out that's the only way it could be said
[1:16:29] to be
[1:16:32] right come on Brothers you might find
[1:16:35] the truth laying
[1:16:39] there
[1:16:41] amen the Bible says there's just one
[1:16:43] true and living
[1:16:45] God but yet the world teaches a trinity
[1:16:48] where did they get it
[1:16:50] from because of people reasoning
[1:16:56] reasoning Factor develops into it not
[1:16:58] the
[1:17:00] Bible sit down with the Bible and read
[1:17:03] it read it for
[1:17:06] yourself but don't just read one
[1:17:11] page read it all the way
[1:17:15] through and then come show me it's
[1:17:20] wrong he come show me the word of is
[1:17:24] wrong ah you just hard-headed well good
[1:17:27] I'm hard-headed so what are
[1:17:30] you two old hard heads run together joce
[1:17:34] and Danny looking at each other grinning
[1:17:36] they said they know two hard heads runs
[1:17:43] together but you know it works out after
[1:17:46] a
[1:17:47] while I mean they're still
[1:17:52] together
[1:17:53] but think about
[1:17:55] it so the word of God is
[1:17:58] true it tells us what happened in the
[1:18:01] garden but first it tells us what
[1:18:02] happened to Eve in her thinking
[1:18:09] ability and you know she still thinks
[1:18:11] she's
[1:18:14] right
[1:18:16] right the church still thinks he
[1:18:21] right not arguing with
[1:18:27] nobody I'm just trying to preach the
[1:18:30] truth and just read it right out of the
[1:18:33] word and see what it
[1:18:34] says but also know that Satan can enter
[1:18:38] in to your mind and mind and try to get
[1:18:40] us to
[1:18:41] reason try to get us to think about
[1:18:44] these
[1:18:49] things but God said come let us reason
[1:18:53] there's only one way God will ever
[1:18:55] reason with you that's with the
[1:18:59] word he W reason with you he just tells
[1:19:02] you what it says then we find out it's
[1:19:04] the only thing that is reasonable let's
[1:19:06] stand think on these
[1:19:09] things 231 231 is power 231 anybody have
