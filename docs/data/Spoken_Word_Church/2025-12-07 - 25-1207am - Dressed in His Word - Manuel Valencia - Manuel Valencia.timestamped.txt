[0:00] Sunday school study the there was um the
[0:02] Lord changed the topic and I I just
[0:05] found out last night that uh this
[0:07] morning that there's uh the children had
[0:09] done a little work downstairs and it's
[0:11] precisely the the title of the topic. I
[0:13] just think it's very special you know
[0:15] it's encouraging to know
[0:18] praise the Lord. Let me get the set up.
[0:29] Number two.
[0:41] Yeah. The title today of the Bible study
[0:43] will be dressed in his word.
[0:45] I think it's such a special uh time in
[0:48] this age, right? The Lord has given us
[0:50] eyesap to see and the privilege to be uh
[0:53] clothed and dressed on his word.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; As the brothers get uh they set up, we
[1:02] we'll pray. We'll bow our heads where we
[1:04] are sitting. Heavenly Father, we're
[1:05] delighted to be here in your presence
[1:07] today. We're so thankful that we can
[1:08] have the confidence that your word has
[1:10] the power, Father, to to equip us, to
[1:12] dress us, to give us strength, to do so
[1:14] many things. But today, we'll we'll ask
[1:16] you that you open up, Father, the
[1:18] revelation of how your Bible is uh is
[1:21] the dressing, Father, of your church and
[1:23] of your little bride. And we're so
[1:24] grateful, Father, this day. And we're
[1:27] thankful, Father, that we can call upon
[1:29] you, that we can study your scriptures
[1:30] and and see all these things knitted
[1:32] throughout uh the entire Bible. And in
[1:35] the same way you knit the fabric,
[1:36] Father, of your word in the believer. So
[1:38] we ask today that you do a special
[1:40] miracle, Father, of uh of uh revealing
[1:43] this word to us and may you just anchor
[1:45] it in our souls. I pray in the name of
[1:46] Jesus Christ the Lord. Amen. Well,
[1:49] praise the Lord. So dressed in his word.
[1:51] So the first time we find somebody being
[1:53] dressed was in Genesis and that is in
[1:55] Genesis 3:201. I'll be going through a
[1:58] lot of scriptures really quickly, so
[1:59] won't have time to be flipping through
[2:00] them today, but I have them up here. So,
[2:02] and Adam called his wife's name Eve
[2:05] because she was the mother of all
[2:07] living. Interesting here, right? That
[2:09] that they connects those two.
[2:11] Being a mother means there's a
[2:13] conception. And Adam also and and his
[2:16] wife did the Lord God make coats of
[2:20] skins and clothe them, you know. So, the
[2:23] the first time it was leather, right? It
[2:24] was coats. It's an animal life. Of
[2:26] course, blood was shed. But um the
[2:28] purpose of being clothed is in general I
[2:30] put some notes here is it's to cover a
[2:32] shame or nakedness as we saw but it's
[2:34] also to cover from the weather from the
[2:36] elements and it protects from injuries
[2:38] right uh and mainly it's identify as who
[2:41] you are and what you believe and we'll
[2:43] find that brother Brandham touched up on
[2:45] uh on the topic of the policeman having
[2:47] the authority and he talked about the
[2:49] bride being reviewed. So I believe it
[2:51] matters what you wear of course
[2:53] externally but also we are as persons
[2:55] right we're always displaying also the
[2:57] spiritual clothing that we're clothed
[2:59] with right
[3:00] &gt;&gt; so that's what we'll see today so talk
[3:02] about natural clothing
[3:04] so the Bible makes distinctions there
[3:07] are clothes of services right the priest
[3:09] so to do service in the holy place and
[3:11] the holy garments for Aaron the priest
[3:14] and the garments of his sons to minister
[3:16] in in the priest's office so then we see
[3:19] that God provided the lambs. It says the
[3:21] lambs are for thy clothing and the goats
[3:23] are for the price of the field.
[3:27] So we find that the king's daughter is
[3:29] all glorious within. Her clothing is of
[3:33] raw gold is written in here. And we'll
[3:35] find um the different materials that we
[3:38] find for clothing. We see we see linen.
[3:41] We see different materials like
[3:44] sackloth. We see the Bible talk about
[3:47] silk and scarlet and purple and blue and
[3:50] different either types or colors all
[3:53] signifying something. But you know it is
[3:55] important to be covered. This Bible
[3:56] verse stuck to me when I read it um
[3:59] myself
[4:00] uh just reading through the Bible is one
[4:02] of those Bible verses where you never
[4:03] heard it before but you read it
[4:04] yourself. Nemiah 4:23
[4:07] um so neither I nor my brethren nor my
[4:11] servants nor the men of the guard which
[4:15] followed me none of us put off our
[4:17] clothes. So they were consecrating and
[4:19] it says saving meaning except that
[4:22] everyone put off them off for washing.
[4:25] So this is a time of consecration that
[4:27] was happening. Of course you know Nemiah
[4:29] was a building of of um building up
[4:32] again. So the um the concept here is
[4:36] that
[4:37] we are supposed to be clothed.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; I think that when when we go up and
[4:41] about, when we go, wherever we go,
[4:42] whatever we do, we we are supposed to be
[4:44] reflecting, displaying something, right?
[4:46] Physically, of course, but I I believe
[4:48] spiritually of course uh and and we
[4:51] should not be caught without our clothes
[4:52] off. Of course, the Bible talks a lot
[4:53] about, you know, protecting of uh of our
[4:55] nakedness and and of shame. And I
[4:58] believe that's what this word does and
[5:00] that's what this message came to do for
[5:01] us. And and here we find in Psalm 109 it
[5:05] says, "Let my adversaries be clothed
[5:07] with shame and let them cover themselves
[5:09] with their own confusion so at the
[5:12] mantle of confusion as with the mantle."
[5:16] See, we find in Proverbs 31
[5:19] um the the virtuous woman. So we find
[5:22] where it says, "She maketh herself
[5:23] coverings of tapestry. Her clothing is
[5:26] silk and purple." I just always loved,
[5:29] you know, the Proverbs 31, the the uh
[5:32] virtuous woman. And I've always could
[5:34] visualize that, right? It's a woman that
[5:36] um it's laboring to ensure that her and
[5:40] her family is is clothed, right? And
[5:42] that it's covered and that it's uh ready
[5:44] for the in this case for the element,
[5:46] for the winter. So, I think this Bible
[5:48] uh this God's word, this message has
[5:50] closed us and and it and it has a
[5:52] utility behind it. It is not just a
[5:56] display. It is a display, but it also
[5:58] has it's an empower and an authority
[6:00] that follows that. It's it's um it's in
[6:03] I wish we could see in the unseen,
[6:05] right? You know, I know we know Solomon
[6:06] spoke about um the the grass and the and
[6:10] the lay leaves and the flowers being
[6:12] covered and and being uh being clothed
[6:14] uh and that not even Solomon was clothed
[6:17] in in such a glory. And it says and then
[6:20] in other places it says if God cares
[6:21] about the grass and talking about you
[6:23] know the feeding the birds and all that
[6:25] how much more does he care of dressing
[6:26] the grass how much does he care about
[6:28] about you? So it is important it is
[6:30] important what we're dressed and clothe
[6:32] upon. In Mark 1 we see 16 and John was
[6:36] clothed with camel's hair and with the
[6:39] girdle of skin about his loins and he
[6:43] did eat locust and wild honey. So the
[6:45] Bible's very descriptive, right? Always
[6:47] describing what everybody had their own
[6:49] purpose. And it's interesting because
[6:51] then we find Jesus was clothed with with
[6:52] linen, right? So see, it all has its
[6:55] place. It all has his uh it's uh its
[6:58] purpose. So Elijah second uh Kings, we
[7:02] find out that um Eli Elijah, he was
[7:06] going up. He said, "Oh, you asked for a
[7:08] hard thing." When he wanted a double
[7:09] portion, right? So see that mantle
[7:11] represented a double portion because
[7:12] that's what he asked for. And he said,
[7:15] "If you see me if you see me going up,
[7:18] then then you'll you will, right?" Uh
[7:21] but then verse 12, it says, "And Elisha
[7:24] saw it. He saw the he saw him going up
[7:27] and he cried, "My father, my father, the
[7:30] chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
[7:32] thereof, and he saw him no more." And he
[7:36] took hold of his own clothes and rent
[7:38] them in two pieces and took up also the
[7:43] mantle of Elijah and that fell from him
[7:47] and went back and stood by the bank of
[7:49] Jordan to continue the work right in the
[7:51] ministry. I think it's beautiful that we
[7:53] have a mantle of grace this time. We
[7:55] have clothes of righteousness. So
[7:57] talking about spiritual clothing now and
[7:58] I'll make this a short Sunday school
[8:00] teaching because I know we got an event
[8:01] later today. So Isaiah 61:10,
[8:05] it says, "I will greatly rejoice in the
[8:08] Lord. My soul shall be joyful in my
[8:11] God." Scriptures we read last Sunday
[8:13] because we were talking about joy. But
[8:15] it's also fitting here because it says,
[8:16] "For he hath clothed me with the
[8:19] garments of salvation."
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He hath covered me with the robe
[8:25] of righteousness
[8:27] as a bridegroom deckth himself with
[8:30] ornaments. All this has done is is
[8:32] picture a bride who decking himself with
[8:35] ornaments and as a bride adornneth
[8:38] herself with her jewels. I'm thankful
[8:41] that we've read you know that the bride
[8:43] has made herself ready and uh was
[8:45] meditating a lot about the 10 virgins.
[8:48] It's not written in the Bible as so, but
[8:49] we do know that uh the cry was at
[8:51] midnight and we do know that um that the
[8:55] others didn't make it in time, right?
[8:58] And they went to sleep. And usually
[8:59] people go to sleep, they some of us put
[9:01] our pajamas on. And I just think it's
[9:03] important, you know, that it's the
[9:05] vigilance, you know, the the fact that
[9:07] they were they had their lives, they had
[9:09] they were their oil was there and that
[9:12] they were uh ready and expectantly
[9:14] waiting. May the Lord find us that way
[9:16] here. So in Job 29 it says it it was a
[9:20] parable. That's the first verse how it
[9:21] speaks about how Job spoke a parable. So
[9:23] all this was in a parable. But then he
[9:26] says, "I put on righteousness and it
[9:28] clothed me. My judgments was as a robe
[9:33] and a diadem." See a lot of parallels
[9:36] here about robes and raignments and
[9:38] coverings and
[9:41] and being clothed and being dressed.
[9:43] Here's an example in Galatians 3:27.
[9:47] For as many of you as have been baptized
[9:51] into Christ
[9:53] have put on Christ. In a lot of other
[9:56] translations, here's an example. One, it
[9:58] says have clothed yourself with Christ.
[10:02] So put on, right? It's something you put
[10:04] on as a display, as a something you you
[10:07] carry with you. In 2 Chronicles 6:41, it
[10:10] says, "Now therefore arise, O Lord, into
[10:12] thy resting place. Thou in the ark of
[10:16] thy strength, let thy priest, O Lord, be
[10:21] clothed with salvation, and let the
[10:24] saints rejoice in goodness. Amen. So in
[10:29] first Peter, it says, "Likewise, ye
[10:31] younger, submit yourselves unto the
[10:33] elder.
[10:34] Yep. All of you be subject one to
[10:37] another and be clothed with humility."
[10:40] See, it's it's the attributes of of
[10:43] God's word and display. I can only
[10:46] imagine, right, if you actually could
[10:47] see in the other dimension, right?
[10:48] Because clothing, what we have external
[10:50] is a representation of the spiritual is
[10:54] the different ornaments, the different
[10:55] jewels and what they represent and the
[10:57] different aspects of of the of of God's
[11:01] spiritual dimension, right? Where we can
[11:02] just see somebody being clothed in
[11:05] righteousness and humility and having a
[11:08] robe. So it actually makes distinctions.
[11:10] There's clothes, there's dress, there's
[11:12] rains, there's garments, there is actual
[11:16] there's different layers. Sometimes
[11:17] people wear a mantle, sometimes they
[11:18] wear a scarf. And it's just beautiful
[11:21] how it's typifying. But if you could see
[11:22] that in the other dimension, you
[11:23] probably just see and we'll see how
[11:25] Jesus when he was went into Mount
[11:26] Transfiguration, right? His um he he was
[11:30] wearing natural clothes, but all of a
[11:32] sudden, I believe their eyes were open,
[11:34] right? Because they say they saw they
[11:36] saw
[11:38] um they saw into the other dimension,
[11:40] right? They saw the others coming in and
[11:42] joining and they saw Jesus uh it began
[11:45] by his countenance being transfigured
[11:47] and being uh shining and then he says
[11:49] that his linen was white as as snow as
[11:52] is glistening. Amen. So it clothe
[11:55] humility for God raises resisteth the
[11:58] proud and giveth grace to the humble
[12:01] again. And so speaking here about being
[12:03] dressed in his word in Revelations 1:3
[12:05] says, "And in the midst of the seven
[12:07] candlesticks, one like unto the son of
[12:12] man clothed with a garment down to the
[12:15] foot and gird about the paps with the
[12:18] golden griddle girdles." And here an
[12:21] interesting fact I found that in the
[12:22] message in 54, brother Man was speaking
[12:24] on uh the seven church ages. That was
[12:26] the title of the message. We know it's
[12:28] back in 54 I believe it was. Um but one
[12:31] of the interesting parts is that he
[12:32] typified the bride on here. He's just
[12:34] mentioning here that you know speaking
[12:36] about about the paths and the different
[12:38] things and he actually outlined every
[12:39] single one of these because it says it
[12:41] does say like unto the son of man. And
[12:44] um it's a it's it's an interesting
[12:46] parallel there that I found. But in here
[12:48] it says he that overcomemeth
[12:51] the same shall be clothed with white gar
[12:54] raignments and I will not blot out his
[12:57] name out of the book of life. speaking
[12:59] to different groups here. But I will
[13:01] confess his name before my father and
[13:03] before his angels.
[13:05] In in Luke, we see that but the father
[13:09] saith to his servants, bring forth the
[13:11] best robe
[13:14] and put it on him and put a ring on his
[13:17] hands and shoes on his feet. Just
[13:20] thinking about the elements of um how
[13:24] God made provisions, right? how
[13:27] how um the children of Israel talked
[13:29] about how their clothes did not wax old
[13:32] and their feet did not um and their
[13:34] shoes did not um
[13:37] did did not stop functioning. Anyway, I
[13:39] forgot how I read it, but um I just
[13:41] think it's beautiful how I grew up from
[13:43] a generation where my father um they had
[13:46] no shoes. They literally walked around
[13:48] without shoes. And so my father's uh
[13:51] father, my grandfather being a shoe
[13:52] maker, as I mentioned before, you'll see
[13:54] the whole school class with nobody had
[13:56] shoes on except my dad.
[13:59] Yeah. It was made out of just leather
[14:01] and then little nails that you put like
[14:03] on a little edge. And then what they
[14:05] would get is old tire rods from just the
[14:07] road. They would cut those out. That's
[14:10] what they would be the that would be the
[14:11] sole of your feet, of your shoe. And I
[14:14] just think it's special, you know, that
[14:15] God made provision for for us. And here
[14:18] it's it's the prodigal son. And that's
[14:21] all of us, right? The Lord puts on his
[14:23] best robe on us. You know, uh when I
[14:26] didn't put on the notes here, um
[14:29] but uh when Jesus uh it was at the
[14:32] cross, it talked about how they rent his
[14:34] clothes. And in one place it says they
[14:36] rented in four pieces and how they
[14:39] actually put on another kingly royal clo
[14:42] on him and mocked them, you know,
[14:44] saying, "Hey, king of the Jews." and
[14:46] they actually kneel down. Makes me
[14:48] wonder, you know, if they were really
[14:49] fulfilling a prophecy even though they
[14:51] were mocking, right? But they were he he
[14:54] was being clothed even in his cross.
[14:57] Clothing matters. What we're clothed
[14:59] about and what we hear about uh it does
[15:01] matter.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Isaiah 61 it says to appoint
[15:05] unto them that mourn in signs. So the
[15:07] bride to give unto them beauty for
[15:10] ashes, the oil of joy for mourning and
[15:14] the garments of praise. I love that
[15:16] song, right? Put on the garments of
[15:18] praise. It says for the spirit of
[15:20] heaviness like against the spirit of
[15:22] heaviness, right? And I just think it's
[15:24] amazing that um even when we're
[15:25] praising, we're displaying garments.
[15:28] We're displaying um our garments of
[15:31] praise unto him that they might be
[15:33] called trees of righteousness,
[15:36] the planting of the Lord that he might
[15:39] be glorified. Amen.
[15:41] So we find here second Corinthians it
[15:43] says for this we groan earnestly desire
[15:46] to be clothed
[15:49] &gt;&gt; upon with our house which is uh from
[15:52] heaven. For if so be that being clothed,
[15:56] we shall not be found naked.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; For we that are in the in this
[16:02] tabernacle do grown, being burdened, not
[16:06] for that we would be unclothed,
[16:10] but clothed upon that mortality might be
[16:13] swallowed up in life. Amen. So this life
[16:17] that we walk, this blessed message that
[16:20] we live, this blessed Bible, it's
[16:22] preparing a bride and it's a type,
[16:24] right? It's clothing her and I think if
[16:25] you could see it and remember we we'll
[16:28] show the Bible the message quote here
[16:31] where brother Brandon was saw a bride in
[16:33] review
[16:34] and it actually says that it uh it
[16:38] brought joy to his heart. In one place
[16:40] it says that that will be my crowning of
[16:41] my ministry is is to take the the word
[16:45] the clothes of the word
[16:48] and to be able to dress the bride and
[16:51] prepare her for this message. Let us not
[16:54] take for granted that we've been um that
[16:57] these things have been revealed to us.
[16:59] Awake,
[17:01] awake, put on thy strength, oh Zion, oh
[17:04] bride. Put on thy beautiful garments,
[17:08] oh Jerusalem, the holy city.
[17:11] For henceforth there shall no more come
[17:15] into thee the uncircumcised
[17:17] and the unclean. What a beautiful
[17:20] promise, right? I was going to teach
[17:22] today on um the progression of sin. So I
[17:25] think we're having it easy today. So
[17:26] bear with me as I as I developed this
[17:29] this uh title. Um, for some reason late
[17:32] last night, um, I had almost all the way
[17:34] done, but I think that's for another
[17:36] time because it it just closed up on me.
[17:39] So, you're having it easy this morning,
[17:40] huh? Going to be easy on us. All right.
[17:43] Zechariah 3. Now Joshua was clothed with
[17:46] filthy garments and stood therefore
[17:49] before the angel. And he answered and
[17:52] spake unto those that stood before him,
[17:54] saying, Take away thy filthy garments
[17:57] from him. See, it matters. And this is
[18:00] Joshua talking about, this is
[18:01] Zachchariah. So this is Joshua talking
[18:03] about a priest Joshua named Joshua. And
[18:05] unto him he said, "Behold, I have caused
[18:08] thine iniquity to pass from thee." So it
[18:11] always goes with it, right? There's
[18:12] always a a letting go of an old garment
[18:14] to get the new one, and I will clothe
[18:17] thee with the change of raignment. And
[18:19] in Matthew 22, um it says 11 through 12.
[18:23] And when the king came in to see the
[18:25] guests, so this is the wedding, right?
[18:28] He saw there a man which had not a
[18:31] wedding garment.
[18:33] See, and he said unto him, friend, how
[18:37] cometh thou in hither not having a
[18:40] wedding garment?
[18:41] &gt;&gt; You must have that wedding garment.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; I believe it's been said that uh in that
[18:46] tradition that was your invitation is
[18:47] you your wedding garment that that was
[18:50] your it was provided for the guests and
[18:52] that's what you would wear for the
[18:54] wedding. And he was speechless. He knew
[18:57] like you could see the culture here. He
[18:59] could have just said, "Oh, what's
[19:00] wrong?" You know, what's wrong about my
[19:02] jeans? But he he knew.
[19:06] Revelation 16:15, "Behold, I come as a
[19:09] thief.
[19:11] Bless blessed is he that watchth and
[19:14] keepeth his garments." We need it. We
[19:17] need our garments lest we walk naked and
[19:20] they see his shame.
[19:24] And here in Galatians 3:18, it says, "I
[19:26] counsel thee to buy of me, not just gold
[19:28] tried in the fire."
[19:30] But then it says, "Gold the fire that
[19:32] thou mayest be rich." And so that means
[19:34] you also have to buy white rain that
[19:38] thou mayest be clothed and that thy
[19:41] shame thy nakedness do not appear and
[19:46] anoint thine eyes with Isaps
[19:48] that thou mayest see. See his message
[19:51] came to give us Isa but again came to
[19:53] give us gold tried in the fire but also
[19:54] came gave us a white raignment by of me.
[19:59] So just briefly going to go over God's
[20:01] raignments in Psalm it says the Lord
[20:04] reignth he is clothed with majesty the
[20:06] Lord is clothed with strength. See see
[20:09] the virtues here wherewith he had ged
[20:12] himself the world also is established
[20:15] that it cannot be moved. Matthew says he
[20:19] went to Pilate and be begged the body of
[20:22] Jesus. Then Pilate commanded this is um
[20:25] Joseph of Joseph the the one that gave
[20:29] him his tomb. Then Pilate commanded the
[20:31] body to be delivered. And when Joseph
[20:34] had taken the body, he wrapped
[20:38] it in clean clothes. Never seen it that
[20:40] way. His body needed to be wrapped and
[20:44] it was wrapped in clean clothes. You can
[20:46] imagine the condition of the body. And
[20:49] to me, it's interesting that he came
[20:51] wrapped
[20:53] and he left wrapped. In Luke 2:12,
[20:56] beautiful connection here. It says,
[20:59] "And this shall be a sign unto you, ye
[21:03] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[21:06] cloth lying in a manger." I think it's
[21:10] beautiful. Must have been linen. I wish
[21:12] I wish I could have I kept on looking to
[21:13] see if I if it was linen, but you know
[21:15] the day it must have been linen. But I
[21:17] know in the earlier scriptures it did
[21:18] say that he was wrapped in clean clean
[21:20] cloth. It says clean linen cloth. And in
[21:24] Mark five we see for she said if I may
[21:27] touch by the by but by his clothes I
[21:31] will be whole. You know the his uh the
[21:34] hem of his garment. In Revelation 10,
[21:36] I'll wrap it up here a couple minutes.
[21:38] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[21:40] from heaven clothed with a cloud. What
[21:42] kind of clothing is that? Look how
[21:44] beautiful that is. A mighty angel.
[21:46] Revelations 10:1.
[21:48] And a rainbow was upon his head.
[21:52] And his face was as it were the sun and
[21:56] his feet as pillar of fire. He's just
[21:58] taking care of the clothes, the feet.
[22:00] It's just beautiful. It's a beautiful
[22:02] type.
[22:04] I think if we could see into other
[22:05] dimension, we'd be surprised. you know
[22:07] what a Christian looks like when they're
[22:09] walking in the attributes of God. Psalm
[22:11] 104:2, "Who coverth thyself with light
[22:15] as a with a garment." So, you can see
[22:17] you would see somebody who's uh covered
[22:19] with light when they're walking around
[22:20] as if it was a garment. Probably has a
[22:22] structure to it. Who stretches out the
[22:25] heavens like a curtain this case? I
[22:26] think it might be talking about um the
[22:28] Lord. Matthew 17 and was transfigured
[22:32] before them and his face did shine as
[22:34] the sun and his raignment was white as
[22:38] the light and again same same uh his
[22:41] countenance was like lightning and his
[22:44] reignment white as snow. Amen. The
[22:47] policeman so the uniform right it
[22:50] represented not just power but authority
[22:52] right it says it takes authority. So and
[22:54] the author and the church has an
[22:56] authority from Jesus Christ. Just a
[22:58] couple more quotes here. In my name,
[23:00] they shall cast out devils, speak with
[23:01] new tongues. If they take up serpents or
[23:03] deadly things, it it'll not harm them.
[23:07] If they lay their hands on the sick,
[23:09] they shall recover. That's his given
[23:12] authority. Now, what if the same little
[23:15] policeman is afraid to raise his hand
[23:18] and step out in that traffic? He better
[23:21] take off that uniform, present the badge
[23:23] back because he'll never make a
[23:26] policeman. Neither will he ever make a
[23:29] believer as long as we're afraid to
[23:31] exercise the authority that's been given
[23:34] us by Jesus Christ. And that authority
[23:36] was represented with the uniform with
[23:38] the policeman uniform. We have victory.
[23:40] We don't have to have any we don't have
[23:43] to fight for victory. We already have
[23:46] victory. He conquered it for us. Not us.
[23:48] He conquered it for us. We are not the
[23:51] mighty conqueror. He is the mighty
[23:53] conqueror. Amen. And here he find out it
[23:56] just typifying that I'll read what's
[23:59] highlighted here and then it says one of
[24:02] these days with his beautiful bride all
[24:05] clothed and made herself ready though he
[24:09] has scars in his hands nailed prince he
[24:12] will stand as a king the king of kings
[24:15] and the lord of lords I want to see that
[24:18] someday and here's the bride in review
[24:21] there came up that little bride lovely
[24:23] in the vision
[24:25] And I not think about this and not think
[24:28] about it just sitting here watching
[24:30] outside and there come the bride. I
[24:33] heard a voice by the side of me saying
[24:36] here is a preview of the bride and she
[24:39] came by. I noticed her
[24:41] the way she was very lovely, pretty
[24:44] young. She was walking just as as just a
[24:47] step as she could. Not a march, just in
[24:51] the stride of a woman. how they walk
[24:55] gracefully ladylike. That's the way she
[24:58] was walking coming up on my left side
[25:00] and she went out of my side. Just a few
[25:02] more here. And um and in here it says,
[25:05] "And I've not shun to declare to you the
[25:08] whole gospel of Jesus Christ and my
[25:10] heart's desire to meet the church which
[25:13] he died for clothed in righteousness."
[25:16] And then it says of his own blood,
[25:18] dressed in his word and the
[25:20] righteousness of his word. for his word
[25:22] can never fail.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that bride that came in review
[25:27] again, look what it says here. Now as
[25:29] she passed by, the whole back part had
[25:32] no covering at all. Then as she passed
[25:35] by, I felt faint and sickly.
[25:38] Then he said the voice, "The bride will
[25:42] come into preview again." And there the
[25:45] bride came behind her, the very same
[25:48] looking bride that passed at the
[25:50] beginning. He had seen her before in the
[25:52] vision. Then my heart jumped for joy.
[25:55] See, he saw her to know that there will
[25:59] be a bride. He's seen her. He's seen you
[26:02] in the preview. And she will be made of
[26:05] the same thing
[26:07] and clothed in the same thing.
[26:11] That the one as the one that was at the
[26:13] beginning, she is to be called and I
[26:16] know that is truth. If the truth is if
[26:19] it isn't true then every vision look how
[26:22] important he this is to him every vision
[26:24] that I've had in the back has been wrong
[26:27] meaning previously and anyone knows that
[26:30] no one thing has ever told us but what
[26:34] was truth it come to pass just and can
[26:37] you see then the filthiness of the
[26:40] modern church calling herself a church
[26:42] here's the last one I hope he will crown
[26:45] my ministry of of of this of letting me
[26:50] take the clothes of the word, the
[26:52] revealed word. He's seen her, so he know
[26:55] what he looked like. And dress his bride
[26:58] in the clothe of the word for his
[27:01] righteousness.
[27:03] And I hope he will crown me. Let me
[27:07] stand on that day. Say, behold the lamb
[27:10] of God that taketh away the sin of the
[27:14] world.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
