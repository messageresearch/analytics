========================================

so far yeah right holy hallelujah look there's a sign cool no no I'm just I'm just winging it this morning is a lady sorry mr. Peter one all right go ahead look I'll just go to our house y'all can they read longer look separately i'ma read if you want to turn into the luge a 13 and verse ATP but most of our brains are bobbing the operated on this thing that's alright just listen to me when I read it okay one two three versus four location Luke chapter 10 verse 18 and it says and he said of the deal platter and you said in the bill I'll be healed sickness ladies fall from heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven you know okay somebody would mention it lately as they repented preaching or teaching from school I'll give you the world but you just as you as you read scripture and through the course of your life things just it's like a I know brother Wade mentioned many times it's like onion skin it just keeps unfolding and unfolding and the more you talk to the more you read about it the more you see and I think this little scripture some of these little scriptures in Matthew Mark Luke and John and all the ones in the New Testament everything just begin unfolding there's so there's so much media into these little things so maybe this morning I just want to talk about something that's a little bit me a quote I like the coldest Wesley said he said when I was called to preach then I was called to study and I believe every minister is called a study and get into word and get into something so needy things and if anything in this one is a little message seems a little bit a perplexing or whatever then by all means go to go to wake up Dale and ask you about it and see if you like the brains in search description let's see if it's truly what the Bible says this little scripture has some some some real leaders talking about first of all power it's talking about a of power that you know brother Branham talked about the difference between a knowing one and and a real vote again the son of God there's a power that came to these disciple the only difference he said I give you power to tread on the surface at the power over all the enemy power to power to cast out Devils power to particularly preach and do all those things that that forget they weren't born again and you can see that even in their lie in this stage you know Peter would he didn't quite have a grasp of what Jesus purpose was when he said Jesus don't know you're not going down on the cross and everything ain't easy turnaround said get behind me Satan because he was he didn't have a revelation to understanding of what the word looks so there's a power that comes from being annoyed and having a power that comes on your life that just that anointing falling on you but there's a different power that could that comes with the life of Christ himself coming it in telling you the power become sons of God the power of you make in the image of God in the image of who he is you know we talk about the word a lot that's kind of something that we you know we say we're based on the word I wonder sometimes if we really understand what the word means the word is not just the letters on the page the word the word is not just the intellectual understanding of what the word is not just being a repeat like a pair that it's what a preacher says when a word is the rip the word the person of Jesus Christ is the person and that person is who gives you power when that person comes to live that's out of you to make you in the image of what was written before the foundation the world that person is living and that person is give powering you to becoming to the English of your maker that person that that that's does you know the letters of the page really almost they to really give power to the letters on the page something hasn't had to happen at Calvary something something had to happen it devil so filled in Jesus's ministry and what it was was that these words that were on the page had to be put inside a flesh and when that word is on the pages put inside a flesh there becomes the gospel because Paul said I cannot even word old but I came to you in power and the demonstration of the Spirit and much assurance because it's not just letters on a page but it's the power of the gospel is priests power to deliver maminta stre has power to power lay on our hands power to preach the word and that's what the preaching of the gospel is the power and the demonstration because it brings what was written in heaven down into earth down into your flesh and then it can make you is molded into his image so that's it you know you go through all these scriptures talk about something's being written something we're written and that's how I believe now and they say we're coming to a place where we know who what was written and we can identify ourselves in the scripture we can look in the scripture and see the scripture speaking of what's happening to us in this day and not so much anymore what you know we used to look at and we say well I know that God sent a prophet I know that God God he came down and vindicated on top of the pillar of fire but now you know there's something that had to happen between Jesus being manifested on the earth and Jesus taking his kingdom and what that was that it has to one had to be coming to realization in the manifestation was the revelation of a bride the mystery of a bride had to come and that's what's been happening that all through the seven churches that the bride that Gothel have been being preached and the bride is being unfolded and being declared then now that now you begin to look in the scriptures and you can see you can be identified on what the scripture says about you and you can look and say that I know that that God word is being fulfilled in my life and that is the power of the power become sons of God the power of God being made manifest in your life that you are becoming one with the word is that right let's look at God's power to transform just read this to me but you can just listen just listen you other you know whether said it's an old familiar text anything of your pastor says use down through time it's been used as it was written but yet one thing about the Word of God it never grows old because it's God it never grows old through every generation now for pretty near about twenty eight hundred years or better this word of God has been read by man priest as so forth it never does it grow old I've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time I read it I find something new that I looked over the first time right hey that's a truth but now listen if she said 'no call it is inspired it is God in letter form see it's the attributes of God speaking 4/4 and it's placed on paper now now you think you know the scripture says you when when when Jesus for smoke when God was talking to John he said where were you the sons of God shouted for joy and here he's talking about the attributes of God that what was going God before the foundation of the world now is in letter form and what didn't letter form is speaking out with the attributes of God speaking for from this page being revealed in your life and what will the nationís back there and now being made manifest in you here in flesh on earth what was in heaven is now in earth what was in what was there is now coming to be made matter deserve that's the gospel we say the gospel is just good news the gospel is God becoming making himself manifest in your flesh like like in the Old Testament when they when that pillar of fire came and dwelt the kingdom and move down into the badger skins and in a place in the side of the ark the word that your tables of stone and then when Jesus died on the cross out from his side came water blood and spirit that showing that the corrupt abroad was going to come from inside just like this tables of stone they were written that that that God's Word was inscribed by the finger of God were placed in the side they are by the finger of God and that's how you steal varieties you're writing his word in you to make his word come to pass just for his word in you if you can see if you look at God's working to see yourself identified and that gives you face because you know where you came from and you know where you're going and you know what's taking place right here he'll give you faith Hey in the revelation of who Jesus Christ is faith is the revelation of his name's putting his name the revelation of his name and you and your forehead and putting it and you're sealing him because you know who he is and because you know who he is and his word is opening up to you that you know who you are because you're part of you and that day you shall know that I am and the father you and me and I on you and all those other things because you have a revelation of Jesus Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ is unfolding you and if God is the book and the book is being unfolded to you then he said look what was the message for what was the message for the message is the revelation of Jesus Christ the message and it was not even said so much program didn't go up it didn't come so much even to tell us to be born again because we already knew that we even know that but listen as Charles Finney and now all of those preachers that preach down to the age that because the way to be born again is never changed it's always been by faith oh that was the very first Sunday School I have a priest with third tallest was that able sacrifice to able sacrifice was dedicated because he he believed God he came in with simple faith to believe and God came down he consumed his offering by fire the same way that you get the new birth wait until God comes down to consider accepts your space accept your faith and human and consumes it with the holy fire and burns out all the dross the whole thing that's not for us to be in there the one that what's the message sit for the message is set to prove to you to show to you that God thought of you before the world before the foundation of the world but that eternal thought in you was something that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's always Hebrews 13:8 he always knew you in his authority always had a plan for you to be come into this world and he were always in the mind of God you already thought when he was going to cross you or his mind when he was he was on that cross thinking about you give it up his life for you and you were only in his mind when using the garden Gethsemane crying out to God Father let this cup pass through me but never less not dying but not not modeling but I be dealing because he was he came to fulfill God's Word which is to bring forth the attributes you know the attributes the record of those attributes is the book of life the record of how they came into being by the word down through the ages the word being born spoken into existence and that's what the message is the message is to showed you that you always were in the mind of God but you bypass the word to come into flesh but now God made a way back through the word he may have way back by the mystery of the gospel he made a way back for you to hear the word and believe it accept it and then become one with the word so by this message by the gospel that we've heard we know where we came from we know who we are and we know where we're going back and now give us reaction face because when the bribe against realized who she is all those other things she'll be able to begin to be able to have a testimony should be able to be able to speak the word because her self is moving away herself she she's back at home and the father's beginning speaking her because she's realizing who she is everything all right yeah just saying that break it up some more what I can let me read this quote I didn't know the resume of the ages program said because I want to get this about the annoying one there's a different you know we shouldn't be we shouldn't be afraid to get in the anointing because we might feel like you might be an anointed one that don't be afraid to get into it because in the church age book refers to get in the spirit and get in the spirit for a revelation he said does it this very moment we in the complete fulfillment of Matthew but it's a much different were possible they shall deceive the very elect and in doing that they shall attempt to deceive the very elect while the spirit of Antichrist in the false anointing one of this last day these false ones have already come in Jesus name claiming that they have been anointed of God for the last day not now I'm a speaker wants to difference we're northern one what's the difference somebody that just on their spirit has an annoying the truth the true holy hosts are known in their flesh so what's the difference between that and a real son of God not one is going to look correct school they're going to be signs and wonders following all those different kind of things it doing things maybe raising the dead even those cast out Devils and all those things but there's a difference between that and the lie that person of Jesus Christ coming and stepping inside of that person and causing them to know the order to understand the word because when you understand the word you're becoming part of the word you're being made in the image of God and that's the difference between the power of an anointed one and the power of the Son of God give you power to these sons of God didn't believe power to be sons of God that gives you power to be made in the image of God that God becoming tabernacle himself inside of you so listen to the rest of this quote they are the false messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but are they one with the word that's program asking that question never they have added to it or taken from that no one denies that the Spirit of God manifesting a gifts his opponent but like Balaam they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word of bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain see there's another evidence about your motives and objectives is your motive an objective to get United with a word no matter what the cost is your motive an objective to lay down your position in the church your position in the community or whatever other people think about you to die yourself so that you can become one with the word are you interested in your own personal gain your own personal motives it comes down to your personal motives to listen to what he says yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas when a ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong spirit and motivating them of course now a brother who speaks about seed it can be a little bit confusion if you're not in tune with what he's talking about because there was a feedback there before the foundation of the world when that attributes are being made manifested in him and then to be see down you have to receive the word you have to hear the word and that word has to be quicker than you but what that does is it can if that's that same eternal life in you when you hear the word and that comes to life it connects you back there with that eternal see you in heaven and now you can say that elijan me never advocating and there is never a heaven is the karate connected back there without eternal life that eternal sea he said yet they preach so here is it religious oh my they outshine the elected effort and zeal but it is layout of sea and not aprox where it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them that preached the second coming of Christ but deny the advent of the Prophet messenger though empowering signs and true revelation he eclipses them all is this false spirit that in the last day is so close to the real can be distinguished only by deviation from the word and that's the only way you could tell because the difference is the sons of God are coming into the image of God where over here you've got somebody that the now the word don't know or don't understand the word because they're just there after their own motives and textures and things and whenever it is calling being anti word it falls back on the one argument we have already shown to be false we get results no we have to be of God that's how it be so close to this last day of of the see the very link if it were possible but in this day I believe the very life is coming to us coming to a pinnacle coming to a whole razor edge where we can identify the two spirits in the framework of the church where we can know what the difference is because the Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword dividing in terms of the soul of the spirit a piercing even is a matter of only showing one of the difference is what the difference between the northern one and the real true believer will only goes to live with the person of Jesus Christ is down on the inside of their soul and without that sort of the word we wouldn't know the difference between soul spirit and body but we also wouldn't know the difference between anointed and in that alive being on the inside here but I'm getting Cowell away from my topic my topic was written into him written him because if you see that you're written in him and you see that you're written in in God's Word which is God in letter form then that will give you faith right faith is a revelation faith is a revelation of who you was you know I believe that Jesus began as he began to grow older and he began to see you know being in that little child form but it was a place where you know he was just a little baby and he better humanity could cry out and maybe it as his brain develops he began to learn how to other words and things may be running out in the street his model said come back here and obedient to his parents and before long his brain taught to employ his natural brain got to up began to get to a place where maybe like brother Brandon what it is then his Yugi began to see visions of things maybe his father began to speak to him and you know that's a revelation of the God is the father a different person if he's Hebrews 13:8 he's got a question brother I said who is this no kids dead is that no kids that makes somebody different than Jesus is their father somebody hid from the Sun different from the Holy Ghost he's the same yesterday today and forever he's that same person can split God into three different people though then you've got different personalities different people arguing one of these the same person and whatever that person was back there he was in Jesus Christ he's the same person now I've been putting inside of you he's going to act the same way you're going to do the same way that something God led by the Spirit of God he's going to be the same humans the smell kissing it if you if you've got a revelation of who Jesus Christ because you have a real a revelation of who God is in your life and then you have the answer to who live this milk everyday right but but the Jesus you know he began to you know he'd go and after that time that they left him in the his mom and Daddy while election and they couldn't find him and when they found him he said didn't you know I must be about my father's business he was in a temple asking I don't believe he was asking in a way I like he wanted to know the answer he was asking to probe those those priests the Pharisees and it was a probe probe their mind get something started in their mind and say well maybe I don't understand the Scriptures the way I used to go the word was being made manifest and been amiss and he was the word and he looked back in the scriptures and see himself identified with the scripture like the light when he came to the City Guard and said that this day in his scriptures fulfilled in your ear because he was looking back at the things that were promised about him not now faint spirits a little bit you know that when you look in the scripture you should be identified your life should be identifying the same way that Jesus life was identified in the scripture his whole life was was written out promised out of the scripture exactly how he born he would be born in the place that he would be born to try the he will be born from the end of the trial that he'll be preceded by messenger though the way that he spoke that song as I said he was speaking parables how you've been betrayed that about the potter's field that he'll be crucified with criminals that he'll be hated without a calls not a bowl will be broken that he would render it from the dead that he would ascend to heaven and all those things and can look back to the scripture and read about like he'd be pulled that scroll out from our lands that it's written right here is written about me and that's the proof that you have that you're born again that's the proof that you have is you're going to take a raptures when you look back in the scripture and you can identify yourself with what's written here you can see yourself in God's Word and that's how that's how you almost maybe this is a strange way to stand but when you're falling again it's almost when you've heard the message it's almost like you've been introduced to yourself not not myself it being introduced to the eternal Word of God it was predestinated coming to your heart from the foundation of the world that's why yeah you know run else may be said many times that strange statement there'll be a special scripture that's special to you because that may be that scripture that you hung on to when you were born and giving you stuff no matter what the world says I know the description is true and I know that this the Scriptures writing is sprung to life in you and they're from a scripture maybe all the other word begin to open up and just tell you the whole book became a new turbo because you're being introduced to yourself not not that's maybe a strange way of saying it but you begin to look into God's Word and see what was predestinated to come to you eternally and now it's being made manifest in your flesh the eternal writing that's why John and John 14:23 26 jesus said jesus answered and suddenly in the camara love me you will keep my words while he keep my words because the word keeper is in his heart if a man love me and my father will love it was will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keeping up my sins in the word which he here is not mine but the fathers were Sydney these things have I spoken and he being at present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you what's he bringing to your remembrance what you teaching you he's teaching you what was written before the foundation world what was written in him he's teach you about that eternal life that always was that never had beginning they never had anything at all it always existed when you become a part of God he's showing you those things he's showing you what was written like in John 12 verses 12 to 16 on the next day much people that were coming to the feast when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem two branches of palm tree and look forth to meet him and cry it was then a blessed can your visual that coming from the name of the Lord and use when he had found a young handset their own as it is written fear not daughter of Zion behold thy King cometh sitting on an axis called coat these things understood not his disciples at the first but when Jesus was glorified then remembered a that these things were written of him they were written of him in the word which is the letter of God the God and letter for that this wasn't written the first time or it might be written first time by piano paper but this was always existed in the mind of God never gone there Adam you thought it was always in him and if Jesus will in these pages if this is God and letter form then and you are part of God then you can look into Gus into the written word and see yourself come off the page problem anymore okay let me skip skip down a little bit well let me let me talk about this so both of Jesus either look at Jesus and see your life compared what he is concealing about the life of a Christian he all the things that he did typed out a Christian he was born by a word only there's between his birth in your birth is an angel a heavenly angel spoke his birth and Mary believed it by your brother earthly angel and he you better be careful speaking against the final mission because you can't hear it without without our earthly angel earth angel has to speak it for you to for you here if you understand it for you to be born again at Earth Lane when you say well well I heard it what on earth lanes will didn't you hear from the prophet then you hear from you kitty you can hear from your friends you say oh I just read in the Bible and hardly angel wrote this and earthly it was a little it was important to John and the disciples and all the ones that wrote this they wrote it it was earthly earthly messages that wrote this down so you were born by the word just the same way that he was born by the spoken word from a heavily Angeles and the spirit understand marriage woman people feel the work the there the river Jordan the unknown and came Oh only him and he said he told gentleman doesn't fulfill all righteousness because his purpose was to fulfill all the word and just moving on down the line from the anointing of the River Jordan attacks your birth all the way up to the hear ye him about Transfiguration attacks your adoption He fulfilled all these different phases in the life of the Christian and he was identified in an inscription collect by Aaron and then you can compare your life with that he spoke the word he combated Satan the same way that a Christian combats the devil he'll earnest in the 40 days of cetacean the 40 days where he he used the sword of the word against the devil you know what the word I heard somebody say this recently I thought it was so good I'm going to reuse it the sword is really useless unless you use it it can be laying it on the trail or lay down on the paper or laying around here on your shelf and it should pick it up and use it well I'm good to go do you pick up the sword and go to battle with it he learned obedience to the word Hebrews 5:8 he grew in grace look to 40 it was accepted allowed Transfiguration and all of those things he showed that he was the manifestation of what was written in God's Word now let me go - let me go to our real medial Scripture and we'll start lining up here in a few minutes Galatians chapter 4 verses 67 now this is one that's a little bit it's a little bit me and you don't have predestination right to understand this well brother Brennan was preaching on this you say you say yeah I felt like a Calvinist when I'm talking about this and they said and because ye are sons God hath set forth the spirit up your son into your hearts crying Abba Father because your sons then God says his son is spirit of you well that sounds that sounds backwards it that sounds like it should say you're you gotta get be born again first and then you can be sons what's he talkin about here and verse seven he says we're pulled out and now our Nomura servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ and we've been talking all this time about being written in him about how you would participate eternally the word is present eternally but your farm at work God God never had and youth all about you he knew that you were going to come to receive it let's see what my friend said in the Smyrna interchange in the church age book he says - but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because your sons he just realized collecting scripture again Godman set forth the spirit of the southern your cry Abba Father the verity is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as sons he did not make us sense for we were already his sons but he placed us that sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as the sons we were held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless and here this and because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart - whereby you cried father father upon whom - the spirit fall at Pentecost sons a court upholds sons while they heard the words if this scripture confuses you know Beatrice confusing - I understood it give any little bit go back because before God he always knew you he knew that when you came into the world of a born of your earthly father and mother he knew that one day you would hear the word and let it throw the wind a little bit at first but one day you would open up the door of faith and let him come inside and then that eternal life that was predestinated for you that eternal life was predestinated eternally but he knew you would receive it and when you receive that you're joined with him and so he always knew that you were going to be a son of God and because he only knew that you were going to be a silly God he's president if God it's a friend of Justin Raja there's no past and future with him it's always right now that's the simplicity of the message we're always looking to the past to the future to see what God's going to do be doing he's doing something right now you you are sons of God we because you can see yourself in orderly let me see if I can give an example let me give so an example somebody that saw herself in the word and recognized the gunner and he had always had it in his mind or finish right here and look chapter 1 26 31 this is good story we're all familiar with the angel Gabriel came to Mary and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in an erotic hail thou that art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women Losey quote from now he was quoting from the eternal mind of God and that came to be written on the thinness and letters here and then we can read their lingo back when you go back and see what God thought about Mary but the angel Gabriel knew who Mary was and what her purpose was before she had even fulfilled it and Mary knew that the Scriptures talked about how that Jesus discords in Messiah would be born in Bethlehem but she knew that I they had prophesied that a virgin will conceive but now the engine was speaking to her by what was written in the scripture and she could be identified with it now her eyes will open and she saw that scripture was about her that she had a part to play in the fulfillment of that story right it's alright that makes me feel good I look to my feet what I'm talking about man and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying in cast her mind what manner of salutation this should be in the angel said in her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he told her the name of God and I'm not going to get all this but I was going to get back to how God Rice's naming you and and now that death benefit that's a revelation of who you who you are and those kind of things but then she says very important words being unto me according to thy word and that's that's the real secret of the Christian life when you just say other what I believe it I don't know where so we just open up this to open up this like what I said you know that that shield that Paul always talked about an armor of Christian he said it was shaped like a door the shield of faith that you can open up the door of faith to God and let him come in then all of these promises can be made manifest you amen amen we'll stop right there
