[0:00] now what we're going to do is we're
[0:02] going to go back over the quotes or gene
[0:05] asked my time not here ok I'll have them
[0:07] call me myself already all right good
[0:10] thing tail all right now where we
[0:16] finished that last Sunday was because
[0:20] they want to try to not finish today but
[0:22] get close to finishing and then we're
[0:25] going to go on to the Seventh Seal
[0:27] that's all right they'll take 1 through
[0:30] 13 7 so but I want to try to either this
[0:34] this only a next time to clear
[0:36] everything up show you all the quotes
[0:38] and then kind of I think the dates and
[0:43] all we're pretty familiar and everything
[0:45] okay with the dates we've nailed them
[0:48] down pretty good but when now we got to
[0:50] look at these clothes now once you
[0:53] remember one thing watch what brother
[0:55] Graham saying in here watch what brother
[1:02] random was saying here he is going
[1:05] through the 70th week of Daniel the 70th
[1:11] week I think he's going through these
[1:13] deputy you will right now that I all
[1:17] right but I wants to watch because when
[1:21] we go into the seal quotes what's what
[1:24] he says this is where people are so
[1:26] confused because they say brother
[1:29] branham was confused or he was wrong
[1:31] because what we definitely see in this
[1:36] 6-foot purpose quote and in the one that
[1:39] we're fixing to read more brother Brown
[1:40] said this is what the Holy Spirit cut
[1:42] all night the end right now as the Holy
[1:44] Spirit confuse brother Ralph not
[1:48] confused either but I want you to watch
[1:51] how this transpires because remember
[1:53] last Sunday we showed back over here
[1:57] right here this first quote we're going
[2:00] to read one more time to be third Sunday
[2:02] a watch
[2:06] this is 1957 it was the question magic
[2:13] 20 usually take another picture damn
[2:15] stood back over the old property said
[2:16] there would be 70 or weeds yet loaded to
[2:18] the Jew and the Messiah would come to
[2:20] France and will prophesied a mess of the
[2:22] 70th weeks which was the seven years
[2:26] he's talking about the seven-year
[2:28] Ministry of Jesus Christ he's reducing
[2:31] the whole seventy weeks of Daniel into
[2:34] one week okay which is the three and a
[2:39] half year Ministry of Jesus here or back
[2:42] in a t30 and two three and a half years
[2:45] Ministry of Jesus Christ here that's why
[2:47] we show that chart that Bob had done
[2:49] before you bring that it's not an extra
[2:52] week but it's committed it really shows
[2:54] what brother was talking about because
[2:57] he reduces that down to that Mossad
[3:00] watch how many times he says my side but
[3:03] he does not say that that much in gables
[3:05] instruction see full purpose he's
[3:07] talking about that 70th week this whole
[3:11] week all right cuz look the Mossad there
[3:15] is no scripture I want somebody to bring
[3:17] scripture to me to show me that Messiah
[3:19] was to come and in the middle of the
[3:22] week be cut off there's no scripture for
[3:24] that 0 Daniel 9 says after sixty two
[3:29] weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not
[3:32] for himself right and then he verse 27
[3:36] shall make a covenant with many for one
[3:37] week that's not Jesus because that
[3:40] person breaks the Covenant and we saw
[3:42] all in here that we know it's the
[3:45] Antichrist ok so what prophesied the
[3:49] midst of the 70th which which was the
[3:51] seven years he'd be cut off in the myth
[3:54] what in the midst of that Mossad
[3:56] manosphere let son of man ministry he
[3:58] would be cut off but promise to come
[4:01] back to the Jews through two prophets
[4:03] and gather 140
[4:05] 1000 everybody got that right because he
[4:09] look there's three and a half years yet
[4:11] lauded to them to the Jews it's got
[4:13] kebaya all right Jesus was exactly
[4:16] pretty straight half years and was

[8:32] in just a minute in the midst of the
[8:37] 70th week he breaks the Antichrist
[8:39] branch his covenant with the Jews got it
[8:43] after the kiprotich rough time he breaks
[8:46] it in the middle of the week all right
[8:50] now
[8:53] how about the two prophets they'll be
[8:55] killed our God is a terrible God when
[8:57] his anger but remember that's over in
[8:58] the 70th week and the churches in glory
[9:01] the waiting supper is going on now
[9:06] that's where we seen her coming back to
[9:08] the Millennial temple over here at the
[9:10] end of the Jewish days the anointed
[9:13] everybody got that all right all right
[9:21] the 70th week this golden eagle the
[9:25] little highlight the seventh week this
[9:28] goes on during the 70th week in the
[9:31] middle of it he brings hit because he
[9:32] killed those two Pentecostal preacher
[9:34] now that pretty that's pretty uh you
[9:39] know he's he says it's seven or eight
[9:42] times so he's not just staying at one
[9:44] time and then maybe made a mistake as
[9:47] they say in the message night the moment
[9:50] he started at 70th week or seven years
[9:53] the church is gone how many times he
[9:54] said that before time all right church
[9:56] is gone can you see it friends raise up
[9:59] your hand let's not be cheer children
[10:02] let's not be playful anymore we're at
[10:04] the end time look at 191 though 69 weeks
[10:08] hit perfect buffet 69 hit perfect that's
[10:13] already been fulfilled how much more to
[10:15] left one week our seven-year 69 weeks
[10:19] are finished those 69 weeks hit perfect
[10:22] the gone way of the dudes hit perfect
[10:23] the church age hit perfect red hand down
[10:25] and to the left in church a aren't know
[10:28] what right here this is one they don't
[10:33] like
[10:35] the moment he starts the 70th week or
[10:39] seven years the church is gone how many
[10:41] time he said it this is what they Elijah
[10:44] now listen I'm quoting again re quoting
[10:47] so you won't forget and if you've got
[10:49] your book they actually highlighted it
[10:53] in the book in the Old look now if we
[10:56] did a new book then the old book gets
[10:59] paragraph 192 of the feminine week and
[11:02] he says this is what the Holy Spirit put
[11:05] upon my pen while I was writing that's
[11:10] the first out and argue with them they
[11:12] are you with that or the Holy Spirit's
[11:13] wrong one of those it and I don't see
[11:17] that he gets the wrong interpretation
[11:18] because this is what the Holy pit put on
[11:21] my pendrive all right so now whatever
[11:25] quotes we're fixing to see can't be
[11:27] contrary to that because the contention
[11:32] in the message is is that brother
[11:34] branham preach this whole three sermons
[11:36] and what's wrong and then God straighten
[11:40] him out in the seals that there's only
[11:42] three and a half years left to finish
[11:45] Daniel 72 week that's not true he can't
[11:48] break the Bible the Bible says is one
[11:49] winglet okay so you see that this is
[11:52] what those better put it on my pen while
[11:53] is right they may I ask you a question
[11:55] by go to that book show that quote
[11:57] alright so something must be happening
[12:00] though let's continue on with this one
[12:05] this is where I will preach the other
[12:07] night the 70th Jubilee making it 3430
[12:10] years all right and then he keeps on
[12:14] with 77 will be the seventh if you
[12:15] believe since the beginning of you
[12:17] believe all right all right we're at the
[12:21] end time this is close to the end of the
[12:23] message and we're here at the end of the
[12:26] age at the coming in of the 70th week
[12:33] tell me quick
[12:39] now
[12:43] i watch
[12:45] he has not said one thing about my side
[12:47] right he's given you a chronology a
[12:52] chronological order of church goes one
[12:56] will the church be gone right here
[12:58] Wimbledon if anything we begin after
[13:01] that the Pope is going to come and break
[13:05] the Covenant he's not saying anything
[13:06] about on my side remember that because
[13:10] this is what's going to happen at what
[13:14] then go back revelations 11 who you come
[13:17] about these two prophets how many is it
[13:18] uh-huh thousand two hundred three score
[13:20] day 169 three half years and when they
[13:25] shall be killed in the street right in
[13:27] the midst of this 70th we put it perfect
[13:29] right all right all right mmm now
[13:38] then i watch how sure he wants to ask
[13:40] them how many seas Daniels 70th week now
[13:43] see what the 70th week is still haven't
[13:47] said anything about my side hi all right
[13:50] now let's go to the next he breaches
[13:54] this in 1961 doesn't say another word
[13:56] about the 70th week of Daniel until
[13:58] nineteen sixty three is the evening
[14:01] messenger all right I got that notice
[14:06] that the journey to tolerance has to be
[14:08] taken away first of the Jews the end of
[14:10] the seventy weeks of Daniel takes place
[14:12] the three and a half years Mossad
[14:15] prophesied days bringing in Messiah and
[14:18] then he was cut off the Pratt's in the
[14:21] middle of the 70th week now that sounds
[14:24] like that he's cutting Jesus off right
[14:26] here in the middle of this everything we
[14:27] are as they say in the message he was
[14:30] the three and a half years did he
[14:31] preached was the first half of the 70th
[14:33] week it is according to that Messiah
[14:36] week that that ball had on the chart
[14:39] they're back out there he's talking
[14:43] about my side now he's not talking about
[14:44] events this is events and this is
[14:49] according to the Bible and this is what
[14:50] the Holy Spirit foot on his pen to write
[14:53] he can't change it to what's he talking
[14:57] about he's talking about back over in
[15:01] that quote before 1957 of bringing
[15:04] everything to seven years three and a
[15:07] half years of Jesus's ministry here
[15:08] three and a half years of Jesus's
[15:10] ministry here so when does Jesus
[15:12] prophesied in the last half of that 70th
[15:16] week that he's talking about are the
[15:18] last seven years the seven years of
[15:20] Jesus's ministry not the order in here
[15:26] all right that's when they get mixed up
[15:28] see then there's three and a half weeks
[15:30] left yet there is right there's not
[15:35] seven more years of Jesus's ministry
[15:37] level the only one week they'd only at
[15:39] three and half years of Jesus's ministry
[15:41] left he preached three and half over
[15:44] there pre-screen half here never got
[15:45] that
[15:46] he's bringing in my side watch how many
[15:48] times he says my side because one more
[15:51] time so my find me in the bout will work
[15:53] a Bible says that my side of the antigen
[15:56] we've got off in the midst of the week
[15:57] it's not in the Bible oh my god at them
[16:02] just real quick but I mean it makes
[16:05] perfect sense because we had Jesus as a
[16:07] ministry through the Holy Spirit to the
[16:09] seven churches in the juice get it
[16:12] through 720 them so journey oh
[16:14] absolutely i mean we get look let me
[16:17] interject something cuz we're going to
[16:19] get into it in the seal of maybe 6-8
[16:21] months from now the first time jesus
[16:25] preached no one understood that three
[16:27] and a half years no 100 student until
[16:34] the Holy Ghost fell and then Paul and
[16:37] Peter them picked it up by the Holy
[16:38] Spirit got the revelation of the Son of
[16:41] God we preached it before remember the
[16:43] Son of Man revelation that had been had
[16:46] been taken up the headstone to be
[16:48] rejected but he is to come back in the
[16:50] end time to do what now in the end time
[16:52] we get the full seven-course meal
[16:56] because we understand what's going to
[16:58] happen here plus we understand what
[17:00] Jesus did back there so we get that last
[17:03] seven years of Messiah ministry the Son
[17:06] of Man ministry we get it in the end
[17:08] time the full revelation of in other
[17:11] words the revelation to deter cages they
[17:14] got apart but we get a full revelation
[17:16] all right now if I got that what he
[17:20] brings him aside he was cut off the
[17:22] cramps in the middle seventies week he's
[17:24] caught up in the midst of that
[17:25] seven-year period of Jesus is preaching
[17:28] there right but you can't make him say
[17:31] anything else know what they're going to
[17:33] ask him a question in the seals and it's
[17:35] exactly what we just read and programs
[17:39] anointed Senate now there's a problem
[17:42] somewhere and he never said I was wrong
[17:45] I'm changing it he'll say you didn't get
[17:49] what I said because what what's the most
[17:52] important thing about the whole thing
[17:53] that name
[17:54] you leave that seven-year Ministry of
[17:57] Jesus Christ three and a half years to
[17:59] begin with and this grant half right
[18:01] here that's going to redeem listen look
[18:04] that's going to redeem a hundred percent
[18:06] of Christian Kingdom I said Christian
[18:11] born-again spirit filled people that's a
[18:14] hundred percent of what's going to be in
[18:16] that sixth dimension it's already in
[18:18] there now what's deeds and we're coming
[18:22] back to rule and reign for a thousand
[18:23] years so that is the most important
[18:26] these dates and time thing you know like
[18:28] I said it's not a Salvation issue but it
[18:30] is an issue that if somebody comes up to
[18:31] you and said when I brother Adam was
[18:33] wrong and damaged during the week well
[18:35] if he was wrong in one place that's what
[18:37] brother said he left the message he said
[18:38] brother Brown said if I was wrong in one
[18:40] place he said I'm wrong everywhere one
[18:43] word off got us out the garden one word
[18:45] so you think that three sermons and then
[18:48] changing it back and forth see what that
[18:52] does it puts a question brother Brown
[18:54] said marriage and divorce he preached it
[18:56] because they quit of a question and
[18:58] people's mind what was the question
[19:00] misinterpreted theology that they had
[19:03] preached down to the church ages that it
[19:04] was alright married and horse marry and
[19:06] divorce men divorce right Moses give us
[19:11] a ride to divorce when he said yeah but
[19:12] from the beginning I wasn't them Jesus
[19:15] told them that so brother branham
[19:16] bracelet back there from the beginning
[19:17] it wasn't so one man one life so watch
[19:20] this now watch here we go come up to the
[19:23] fix to the fifth seal I know watching
[19:27] the town of Daniel now the second half
[19:28] at the 70th week massage he starts
[19:31] bringing in the Messiah how long did
[19:34] Christ preached on my preaching now he's
[19:37] now talking about a chronological event
[19:39] of order in this last week he's talking
[19:42] about Jesus preaching a message all
[19:46] right but there's determined yet to the
[19:49] people remember you got a weaning talk
[19:51] about the only city it is only three and
[19:55] a half years to get the people ready but
[19:57] to get that city and all this done over
[19:59] here you've got to have more time
[20:03] and then we proved by the Bible that we
[20:05] got you 30 more days and forty five more
[20:07] days lap it over into the millennium all
[20:10] right the buddy all right with that all
[20:15] right let's read this one but now when
[20:21] it comes to dealing with his room in
[20:23] this last part of the 70th week and not
[20:26] hear the last part of this Mossad wait
[20:28] what he deals with them as a nation he
[20:30] who Oh God Jesus the Messiah all right
[20:34] okay God will completely turn from the
[20:37] Gentile okay got that yes please talking
[20:43] about Amazon message a ministry he
[20:46] wasn't in the 70th week of Daniel he
[20:48] didn't say much about the message only
[20:50] that there's three and a half years left
[20:52] of the message to the Jews all right and
[20:55] my witness some of y'all staring off
[20:56] into space all right cuz we got to deal
[21:01] with this because this is the
[21:03] contentions of people in the message he
[21:04] was wrong over here but he was right
[21:06] here but he's never even in this whole
[21:09] messy to look at it in the sealed he
[21:11] never said I was wrong he never said
[21:12] tariffs that chart he never said I was
[21:15] wrong in it but now he did when he was
[21:17] none like a white horse rider he said
[21:20] God corrected me and I come to tell you
[21:23] now what a man would be God corrected
[21:26] him and he would take being that he
[21:29] preach preach sermons not just one
[21:30] little sermon on a shed somewhere he
[21:33] preached three sermons on the end said
[21:35] the Holy Spirit put that only intend to
[21:38] write that there was one we left Africa
[21:40] after that's why I said according to the
[21:43] Bible in the province message but now
[21:44] there's only three and a half years of
[21:46] Messiah message left son man ministry
[21:50] there's only three and a half years
[21:51] letting not settle all right last strand
[21:55] half years of Daniel 70 we promise to
[21:57] the juice is people remember now they
[22:00] have to prove that this is Daniel's last
[22:01] part of the seven eight week what you've
[22:03] got a question on that watch 70 weeks
[22:07] was promised which was seven years
[22:12] he brands every bit of that stem two
[22:15] weeks of Daniel 27 years the one that
[22:17] Bob showed on the chart that yell at the
[22:19] top if you'll see it it says three and a
[22:21] half over here the Jesus preached in pre
[22:23] and half he's got free from here include
[22:24] property right which was seven years in
[22:28] the mix to the seven weeks to Messiah
[22:30] was to be taught to make sacrifice from
[22:34] South Korean having that what he told
[22:35] her mesial ministry the ministry of
[22:38] jesus christ he preached green hat cough
[22:41] in the middle of that part which was
[22:44] seven years let me see what I'm talking
[22:46] about he condensed every bit of that
[22:48] down and many many times and I don't
[22:49] have time to read him you were reading I
[22:51] told you to read the book he says which
[22:53] is seven years he breaks all the seventy
[22:56] weeks of Daniel down to seven years 13 a
[22:58] half years of ministry over there three
[22:59] and a half years of ministry here and he
[23:01] wants to cut off in the midst of that
[23:03] week but there's no scripture for that
[23:06] right now 70 wheezes problem which was
[23:10] seven years in the midst of the seven
[23:11] weeks on the side be cut off to be made
[23:14] sacrifices he would prophesize three and
[23:17] a half years and then he would be cut
[23:20] off for a sacrifice for the people and
[23:22] there is still a determined three and a
[23:24] half years is still determined for
[23:26] Israel then when Messiah was cut off the
[23:28] Jews blinded look how many times he said
[23:31] my side my side my side he's talking
[23:35] about Jesus he's not talking about this
[23:37] seventy weeks of Daniel in a
[23:38] chronological order he's talking about
[23:40] now if not he said well that's just your
[23:43] opinion well the holy spirit was wrong
[23:45] then in the seventy weeks of Daniel book
[23:50] The Holy Spirit was wrong and now the
[23:53] Holy Spirit change his mind if that's
[23:54] what we're talking about the same week
[23:56] we're not talking about the same way all
[23:59] right here we are on a sixth seal this
[24:02] was my point the other day to do some of
[24:04] the preacher now we're in a sick sealed
[24:06] God has opened five seals he's in number
[24:10] six and he's not said one thing about I
[24:12] was wrong okay because what is the seals
[24:17] the seals are Redemption the seals are
[24:20] not dates and
[24:21] than putting this here and putting that
[24:23] left it's the redemption of us and two
[24:29] people Jewish people because these two
[24:34] prophets opened the sixth seal right
[24:35] here on earth remember revelations for
[24:40] 12 19 that's not to us well whenever
[24:43] where does the seal start revelation 6 1
[24:47] but we get all the spiritual aspect of
[24:49] it the seals has to open to us before
[24:52] they'll open to the youth right all
[24:54] right okay so you see every time he's
[24:59] saying this last part of the 70th week
[25:02] he's not coming up this week he's going
[25:05] at the last part of the Messiah
[25:06] seven-year message of Jesus Christ
[25:09] everybody got that if not I won't say
[25:11] one more time if not then let's just be
[25:13] like the rest of the people in Saturday
[25:15] life are that he didn't know what he's
[25:17] talking about and got straightened him
[25:18] out remember go back to the quote the
[25:20] Holy Spirit put that only spend writing
[25:22] so listen that wasn't that book that
[25:24] dance in a week book was not in man's
[25:26] opinion that was God telling us
[25:29] something I said I onion field where you
[25:31] gotta keep peeling the onion back to get
[25:34] the real revelation because you can't
[25:36] make brother Brown say two different
[25:38] things and in him continue on in the
[25:41] greatest opening of the word that he's
[25:43] ever been in he was always already up to
[25:45] the six deal there would have been me if
[25:48] I would have been wrong and had been
[25:49] just you know so they did in all the
[25:51] other all the rest i remember the fifth
[25:52] seal Jew he said I was wrong he said I
[25:54] thought that was just sold on the offer
[25:56] crying how long he said that the fifth
[25:57] field you God was revealing it to him
[26:00] but he would come in and tell us he
[26:03] never said a word about home we're gonna
[26:04] get to that quote demented that's when
[26:09] they're supposed to be delivered what
[26:10] this life's ministry the last green hat
[26:12] here in Jesus's minute all right
[26:16] then he continued on one solar house how
[26:19] long is Daniel's having to wait last
[26:21] part of the 70 weeks 39 years so there's
[26:24] only three and a half years left of
[26:25] Jesus's ministry after we go after the
[26:28] rapture right all right now let's go to
[26:32] questions and answer I think 63 this is
[26:36] questions on the seals we want to kona
[26:41] Daniel 9.7 confirmed for a week now
[26:43] watch he he goes right over Daniel 9 27
[26:47] does not have any plan to do with Jesus
[26:49] right but now rather random what about
[26:55] this that's what the Holy Spirit on my
[26:57] pen to write but what about the standard
[27:00] 927 no watch he goes right to Jesus
[27:03] Christ what happened was confirmed the
[27:06] Covenant when Jesus Christ on earth
[27:07] preaching to the Jews he never went to
[27:09] the Gentiles at all the codes and
[27:10] ciphers going Billy Gentile devil to the
[27:12] Jews alone now remember they they cut
[27:16] him off let his blood be on us when our
[27:18] children any priest for three and a half
[27:20] years here he watch talk preach Jesus
[27:22] Christ now down to 927 any way you
[27:26] interpret Daniel 9 27 they don't talk
[27:29] about preaching and it will talk about
[27:31] Jews Oh Dana 927 said he shall confirm
[27:39] the covenant with many for one week and
[27:41] in the myth of the week you will cause
[27:42] the sacrifice and oblation to cease I'm
[27:45] about putting it verbatim there's
[27:47] nothing in there about a message
[27:49] preached by the light so he must not be
[27:53] talking about that leak but I'm like
[27:57] what mom and bro Dale's always contended
[27:59] brother branham is picking up their
[28:02] thought their thought being that there's
[28:05] seven more years left of Jesus's
[28:07] ministry because watch i'ma tell you
[28:10] that's half of the 70 week now daniel
[28:13] said he would do they bring
[28:15] that's great know what let's go to this
[28:19] let's go right down to this one that
[28:23] everybody goes to this one right here
[28:27] you have brandy Anthony NAB was looking
[28:30] at some let's say
[28:42] go back
[29:00] I had but me and Papa will get up
[29:02] something this morning I'll find it in
[29:06] my archives here and get minute well he
[29:12] didn't say that I don't think he said
[29:14] there's one
[29:24] I had it ahead of time like I said we
[29:29] got into combat 8030 and I find them in
[29:34] about 15 you find it Bree says its own
[29:40] questions and answers just like 1964
[29:47] right here here it is again I want to be
[29:51] like here's a question all right brother
[29:58] ground hope they might see this so this
[30:02] is the biggest one that all the
[30:04] preachers of the message use excuse me
[30:08] brother branham when you get a message
[30:10] on the 70 church week seventy weeks part
[30:12] of em Daniel I believe you mentioned
[30:14] that the phone last week or last seven
[30:16] years will begin when a bride was taking
[30:18] interaction how many times these want to
[30:23] ask you a question how many times did we
[30:25] just read reset win will that 70 we
[30:28] begin when the bride or the church is
[30:31] gone right that's right now watch he
[30:36] says no no no no good I name now he
[30:40] didn't say I got that wrong he said you
[30:45] got that wrong okay because the thought
[30:48] of this brother must have been was that
[30:50] they were seven years of Jesus's
[30:52] ministry level because watch he goes
[30:53] right straight again not to these events
[30:57] but not the full seven weeks now he just
[31:00] said seven times there was one week left
[31:02] after the rapture and that's what the
[31:05] Holy Spirit always pinned all right we
[31:06] must contend that that stays the same
[31:09] and that he's talking about something
[31:12] else now watch the week started when
[31:15] Jesus came on earth he never said that
[31:19] days anyway this week starts after the
[31:22] church is gone but the Messiah ministry
[31:25] started when Jesus came on earth the
[31:28] massage here he goes print show coming
[31:30] prophesied
[31:31] to the seven weeks he'll be cut off
[31:35] there's no scripture for that and Jesus
[31:39] preach know what goes to preaching Jesus
[31:41] preached exactly doing a half years
[31:44] which is half of the 70 weeks or seven
[31:46] days or seven week we'd dates he's
[31:48] talking he's going through a pretty bad
[31:50] and there's 39 years left all right to
[31:54] me it's very simple he's not talking
[31:56] about this week at all except the last
[31:59] half of that week see look you got that
[32:03] wrong he didn't say I was wrong and now
[32:05] I'm correcting it that would be the very
[32:07] time if the Holy Spirit was present
[32:09] during this time that's what what people
[32:14] the message thinking I'm the Holy Spirit
[32:16] boy you spoke about through brother
[32:17] vinyl but what about this what about the
[32:19] letter said to like wow he was probably
[32:21] wrong there no one man said that's what
[32:26] the Lord told him to write okay he shall
[32:30] come in from the side of the midst of
[32:32] the seven weeks he'll be cut off Jesus
[32:33] preach exactly three and a half years
[32:36] know why don't you watch this he goes on
[32:39] in go straight now this brother could
[32:45] this is a continuation of that question
[32:48] six then it seems like the first ran out
[32:51] years was fulfilled during the ministry
[32:54] ministry well here you've got it right
[32:58] here about Ministry of Jesus but the
[33:02] expression midst of the week seems to be
[33:04] applied only to the ant across breaking
[33:06] its covenant with know that enter Christ
[33:08] breaks is coming it at the end of the
[33:09] last three and a half years what the
[33:11] last three and a half years of Jesus man
[33:13] replace the midst of this 70th week so I
[33:16] got that bro all right as I understood
[33:20] Daniel tape the first 69 weeks ended
[33:24] when Jesus runner Jerusalem 8030 that's
[33:27] exactly what brother Brown said so he
[33:30] can if he tells him something different
[33:32] it's wrong so that the three and a half
[33:35] years of his ministry will be included
[33:37] in the stick to nine weeks and the bull
[33:39] last week or seven years would still be
[33:41] fulfilled and would begin at the Raptor
[33:43] now many times he said that the last
[33:46] week would happen after the right to the
[33:49] church no up you know brother sister
[33:51] everybody is asked question very fine
[33:54] but I believe you've got a little mixed
[33:56] up on what I said let's go back over
[34:04] here and take this book and read seven
[34:05] times just one week left out of the raft
[34:09] of the church seven time and then let's
[34:12] see how that fits with it Jesus came
[34:18] into Jerusalem that is exactly right
[34:20] that was and oh he went right straight
[34:22] in from there was crucified and he did
[34:26] promise I half of the seventy weeds
[34:28] which history and a half remember he
[34:30] condensed the whole seventy weeks of
[34:32] Daniel to one week Jesus preached three
[34:35] and a half years was cut off now he's
[34:38] got three and a half years more ministry
[34:39] left but that has nothing to do with the
[34:41] Bible he can't change brother I'm
[34:44] contains about okay Daniel 9 27 is the
[34:48] Antichrist it's not Jesus cry okay right
[34:52] because whether up listen even better
[34:54] and will tell you God doesn't ever break
[34:57] the Covenant man breaks coming no I
[35:00] never write to cover because if he shall
[35:03] prophesied heat and I'm sorry he shall
[35:05] confirm the couple minute for one week
[35:07] and then the midst of the week he'll
[35:09] know words you have caused sacrifice no
[35:11] places he's knowing him he'll do away
[35:14] with that treaty as that Jesus know not
[35:18] what what I look
[35:20] he did prophesied half of the 70 weeks
[35:22] prophesied days right to Jesus he's not
[35:24] own dates and times and bringing in the
[35:27] city he's talking about the Ministry of
[35:29] Jesus Christ during this time was to
[35:33] getting up the saints for the rapture
[35:34] church they continued on okay everybody
[35:39] got there yeah so the Messiah could
[35:45] leave if you pluck off the Gentiles and
[35:48] you put that together that's the one
[35:50] weakness I that's great and that's the
[35:53] reed moment the reason it is one week is
[35:56] because they cut him off in the first
[35:57] place if they would have accepted that
[36:00] first three and a half they to never
[36:01] been to see they broke they would be
[36:03] scripture God knew what they were doing
[36:04] I knew what they were doing at swank and
[36:08] ride because if they would have accepted
[36:10] the first three and a half years they
[36:11] never been another Korean happy they'd
[36:14] be no 70 weeks today milady been don't
[36:16] see one come up the predestination of
[36:18] God he knew what will it work so he
[36:21] brought it back and said hey I know
[36:23] they're going to cut this off they're
[36:25] gonna cut me off I know that because he
[36:29] had his eyes on that Gentile bride right
[36:31] right but that we also overlaps the 70th
[36:34] that's correct right here it overlaps
[36:37] right here we'll pull that chart up just
[36:39] a second let me read one more quote hey
[36:42] why you going back to what you were just
[36:46] reading there
[36:47] an answer when brother branham speaking
[36:50] the question is first read he serves
[36:53] talked about for seven years and they
[36:56] and then he says that you got it wrong
[36:58] me to go and the first thing does first
[37:00] singing engines is Jesus the Messiah
[37:03] right preaching right for that crown
[37:05] then right after that the sequim quote
[37:08] that he comes to the first thing he says
[37:10] is no Moses and Elijah right so it
[37:13] starts right thing because he's free so
[37:15] when he's speaking of it seven here's
[37:17] the first thing he's talking about his
[37:18] Jesus ministry the second thing he
[37:20] brings up yes he brings up Moses and
[37:23] Elijah and he says they they prophet saw
[37:26] 1200 and he says 64 days video I talked
[37:29] about the other through i have heerd
[37:30] rock layer and then he continues on and
[37:33] he's speaking and if i was a question
[37:35] product about cutting the mix in the
[37:37] midst of the lead back to my dad tries
[37:39] to know that but he's running on what
[37:41] he's talking about that seven here's he
[37:43] covers both house right together right
[37:45] now same thing here and i love community
[37:48] now in the last part this isn't
[37:50] questions and answers again 1963 down
[37:53] the last part the 70th week the last
[37:55] part of it will be during the time of
[37:56] the tribulation period after the rapture
[37:59] of the church then there's three and a
[38:01] half years here that it will be
[38:02] confirmed to them again by prophets he
[38:04] goes right through like like Aaron said
[38:07] he always goes to Jesus and Moses and
[38:11] Elijah so that's the seven-year ministry
[38:14] that he's talking about Jesus Christ the
[38:16] Messiah son of man ministry alright so
[38:19] now just to put a little clarity on that
[38:25] and we'll we'll finish right here unless
[38:27] somebody's got anything else don't watch
[38:33] Jim get kissed by what is the charge how
[38:46] are you told me to delete it I deleted
[38:48] them all right let's say Bob and charge
[38:55] Bob and chart Bob and chart harbor
[39:00] freight all right don't you move it does
[39:06] car rental do thank you all right here
[39:08] we go dance chart yeah they're so in the
[39:12] parking lot you see that huge parking
[39:13] lot sale place us a huge party line real
[39:20] quick this might take a second to load
[39:24] up something does much so many wonderful
[39:28] things on it how long would be before we
[39:31] get that charge you know Bob we have a
[39:34] few things to readjust
[39:40] well hey listen if I want to put a
[39:43] charge less like that sermon last couple
[39:45] waves years ago don't put it out I want
[39:47] to make sure that everything's covered
[39:48] so I will I don't want somebody feel you
[39:51] know what they gonna pick it apart
[39:52] though over this your hair you about
[39:55] that all right here we go pieces of it
[40:00] because really he had right down here he
[40:05] had that Jubilee sounded in the Sabbath
[40:07] months of the 49th year he'd known it
[40:09] sounds in the 50 here or the first year
[40:12] of the next cycle if I got that no Logan
[40:19] I guess
[40:24] huh what does have three forty dollars
[40:26] in a row in 72 sure that is 49 in the 49
[40:30] year cycle the cycle of it you let our
[40:32] English cheer to the honey nut
[40:36] all right right here right there is
[40:41] exactly why brother Brown was talking
[40:44] about the three and a half year gives
[40:45] his ministry here and a three and a half
[40:47] years use of ministry here not speaking
[40:51] of this whole 70th week because that's
[40:54] according to the Bible you can't break
[40:55] that that's according to the Bible
[40:57] alright Daniel 9 27 is when he breaks
[41:00] the Covenant I told him you going to
[41:02] move them bombs over there a little bit
[41:05] but here's your statesville purpose to
[41:07] me the six whole purpose again before we
[41:10] get when we finish this read your six
[41:12] volt purpose there is no way you can
[41:14] bring in our lasting right to seal up
[41:16] vision and prophecy and North the most
[41:18] holy which is us entering into the
[41:21] Millennial temple and then the valve
[41:25] Armageddon starts and destroys all of it
[41:27] and then we got to go do it again but
[41:31] this is exactly perfect my love i'm on
[41:33] the prophets message if you'll pay
[41:35] attention to what he said it okay Jesus
[41:38] was cut off in the midst of that Messiah
[41:42] Jesus's ministry not the same between
[41:44] that's the one week of Jesus's ministry
[41:46] because everything can be wrapped up
[41:49] into what he preached here and what he's
[41:52] going to preach to the Jews here
[41:53] everything everything hinges on us
[41:56] getting the revelation of this message
[41:58] of Jesus Christ and them getting the
[42:01] revelation them to use the people
[42:03] getting a revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:04] through to profits for that last half of
[42:09] that part of the 70th week that brother
[42:11] is talking about in the sealed don't
[42:14] remember the seals is redemption
[42:21] if six-fold and we only get a six seals
[42:24] will do this the six-fold purpose
[42:26] program says six steals finishes
[42:29] reduction well the six volt purpose
[42:31] finishes Israel prediction for the
[42:33] people and the city we don't need a city
[42:36] this is the city we as Gentiles have to
[42:39] build right here that for every man like
[42:42] what lewisham stone mountain defcon that
[42:46] but they literally have a temple because
[42:50] it's too Daniel and the city there's
[42:54] another key to thy people and the city
[42:57] that people only have straight after
[42:59] your ministry left absolutely but to
[43:04] build that city it's going to take that
[43:07] whole if 69 weeks is finished there's
[43:11] one week left after a true but there's
[43:13] not one week of Jesus's ministry left
[43:15] there's only three and a half years of
[43:18] Jesus mithun that's what brother random
[43:19] is talking about not putting words in
[43:21] his mouth because I'm telling you the
[43:23] Holy Spirit put on his cramped into
[43:25] right when he said in this seventy weeks
[43:27] of Daniel book The Holy Spirit didn't
[43:29] change when he preached the seal and
[43:31] he's not changed now and I've not
[43:33] changed one thing that he's big Greek
[43:34] okay so more blessing
