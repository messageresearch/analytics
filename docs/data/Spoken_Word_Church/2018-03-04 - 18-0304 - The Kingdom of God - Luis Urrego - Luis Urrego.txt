TRANSCRIPT
========================================
your brother not for stepping in amen so this morning we want to we want to see where this stop is gonna lead us you know we look at the at the Bible and we see the kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven in handy yeah I see much okay right yeah the kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven we see that it says that in the scriptures it also calls it the kingdom that's right but what is the kingdom of God what is the kingdom of heaven so we want to take this month and kind of look a little bit in depth as to what the kingdom is maybe look at this and then on the third Sunday maybe look at something else just kind of take a little break and then the last Sunday we'll finish it up but we'll see how the Lord leads so all right so the phrase the kingdom of God it started to be used at the time of John the Baptist coming now we know in the Old Testament you know it talks about the kingdom and that's something later on in Daniel where the Daniel 7 and but we'll look at that later but this process when it started being used it was in the in the New Testament even where the phrase was used interchangeably with the phrases the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom amen referring to the same thing they meant the kingdom of God it was first used in Matthew chapter 3 verse 2 and this is the scripture here says in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea verse 2 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand in other words the God's God's Word amen was coming at him they measured the the fullness of God's work amen praise God at that Amen was at him amen and so John was preaching this already of course if we know it was a revelation to him I believe it was a revelation to him right because it was God who revealed to to John the - John - John and behold the lamb of God cometh they taketh away the sin of the world amen hmm and in Matthew 4:17 Jesus says from that or the Bosma scripture says from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen praise God so we see those those there now when you look at that word kingdom in the scripture in the scripture when you look at at the what is Strong's Concordance in the Greek it's the word of Basile Ava and it means kingdom of God kingdom of heaven Kingdom General or evil guy or than Kingdom his kingdom look at this one royal power kingship Dominion rule not to be confused with an actual Kingdom but rather the right or authority to rule over a kingdom now think about that they meant because Jesus they come here to establish the physical Kingdom amen and we're gonna read we have time we're gonna read something here in just a moment when he was talking to Pilate amen he didn't come here to establish but there were people the Jews were waiting for a messiah to come to establish a physical King that's right they were waiting for somebody like brother Brad said waiting for somebody to come and stomp out the Romans and and and for political for the Jews to be a great again politically and for the days of Solomon to return say the days of Solomon work and the Jews who were wanting that back and they thought that they would get it through the Messiah that this the Messiah was supposed to come that way but we know he came a totally different way and I like that's how God that's how God works he totally bamboozles us with the way he does things right you think that God is this goal is working one way and really he's doing it the another way not sure but it comes out perfect all the time amen but he had to be born in a manger a man matter he had he had to be a dentist that doesn't collect it too keen but he had to be born in a manger so was that it wasn't it wasn't I mean they felt that he was gonna come down to quarters down to kfs the high priests come down and and established it just sit on a throne you know just kind of sit and start ruling but that's not how you can you know sometimes you know we think should do things a certain way or that's something that we see that's going on it's happening because of this and in actuality then it turns out a good example is blast last year was the last year when we had the elections yes not two years ago four years ago well everybody thought Hillary Clinton was going to get in but three-quarters of the people in the message thought that that Hillary Clinton was going to get in to fulfill that prophecy that or that that what brother Brennan said there's got to be a you know a woman in the White House or on that bed and Hillary Clinton ain't getting a dress bride I'm sure so many a lot of people left the message because of that all right you know all right the same thing with 1900 same thing with 1977 brother branham brother Brandon clearly said you know I don't prophesied that this is to come out of the Lord you're not just predict that the coming of the Lord things are looking so bleak and so dark and looking so dark by then that I the coming of the Lord you know could be eminent by that you know yes but when the things then happened exactly the way they thought it was gonna happen a lot of people took down and I heard I was I'm glad it didn't happen that time cuz 3 years laters when I was going to be born my mom and dad were just getting married in 1977 yeah you know so I had to come here to be expressed see just like you know we were talking last night and you know the Lamb of God was slain before the foundation of the world right he had to face him but but even though that took place in the mind of God it then actually happened there in heaven you know he'd even physically bleed no you know he had to come down down to earth to release his life just as we had to come down to earth so that we can receive that life I'm seeing and so I had to come down here to earth in 1980 to receive the later on machine right clutter I didn't come to the message until 1999 but I wanted to remove the 7 church ages of denominations before that time of living I bet I've been through different churches if you don't know I've been Catholic I've been Baptist I've been Wesleyan back to the Baptist Pentecostal and then message and that's the full word right there yeah I stay with that it's not with the denomination I stay with the word I praise God some people may say well you're just a you're just a church hopper you know but we call my mom and dad Church hopper but not me because I was living with them at the time but you know what my mom and dad Laure they love this message and it was God just leading them through you know it was just the Lord just they wanted something more even drug believe I'm sorry you were drugged I was drugged you were drugged you were gurgling water yeah and you know in between there you know you you get those that teenage spirit you start getting rebellion essential in the Baptist Church and but you know when God is dealing with you because listen st. John I don't know I'm going this way but all right go ahead but don't name them absolutely and and when I was when I was nine ten years old when we were when we were at the idea with the Jehovah's Witness I would sit there and read their literature at nine ten years old my mom and dad would never asked me to sit down and read their books you know or or their Watchtower magazine I would just go pick up pick up a book and start reading on my own not and it was because there was something in me that wanted to know more about God you know they wanted more and that was the only thing that I had at the time so then that you know just kind of started growing but it's God leading you short I'm a madman so this is not a physical Kingdom it's it's not to be confused with a natural Kingdom but rather the right or authority to rule over a kingdom amen praise God now I want us to read Matthew chapter 6 and listen we're gonna take our time even we got a whole month and so we're gonna just read the scriptures and kind of dissect things as uh you know I believe that it's good for us to do that sometimes it we might get a little because the title is is it internal or is it external but you might get a little carnal you know talk about some some some things because sometimes you know we we talk about you know the great things of God and it's very important you know brother weights bringing out the seals but they'll talking about salvation then you birth and all these things but sometimes there's people that have questions in their mind about external things happening in their life that they can't they can't they don't if you don't if you're not there to help them they're just as good I mean Paul talked about these things you see and we're gonna read later on something that that is very very important Paul had to deal with these things with the Corinthians with neuro medicines and so on it affects our life and it's very important for our lives amen so Matthew chapter 6 verse 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on it's not the life more than meat and the body than raiment so here Jesus is dealing with it says take no thought for your life with the were eNOS that we get sometimes in life about what am I gonna wear what am I gonna wear where am I gonna eat what am I gonna wear am I gonna sleep or where am i what am I gonna do about this bill what am I gonna do about that he said take no thought about it in other words he didn't say don't think about it cuz you have to pay your bills you realize a month later that you can pay your bills again when the power gets cut off but he said don't worry about it don't consume yourself in those things so many people get so concerned with different areas in their life and forget that there's a god that is in complete control you know when I was when I was several years back my wife and testify about this I was so consumed with conspiracy theories and I would get in conspiracy theories and I would you know and and and I was consumed by that and then one day I realized wait a second this is taking me away from the Word of God no matter how true they could be or no matter how how no matter what happened I realized that uh everything that takes place around the world is because God just wants to fulfill his word and it's preparing and the bride is really prepared amen no matter who did what or what it doesn't matter and some people get so consumed by that enough and I preached at a church one time in South Carolina and a sister came up to me afterwards and I mentioned something like that and the sister came up to me and said I started talking about how the government in the area and how it was some sort of conspiracy about the water supply and all this kind of stuff that's that sister you know why why do you consume yourself by that do you realize that if everything that needs to happen happens in order to fulfill the Word of God he said look at it that way because Satan is anointing man right her to do things but it's but if you go brother Graham said that Satan is a tool in the hands of God so whatever God has to do it you know you know let's just let's consume ourselves into work yeah man that's where we need to consume ourselves with no nor yet for your body one day ye shall put on it's not life more than meat and the body than raiment so your life is more than these external things behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them are ye not much better than this right which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature how many would like that I'm sure the tall people wouldn't care too much about that and why take ye thought for raiment why do you worry about raiment or clothing consider the lilies of the field how they grow they don't they don't tall neither do they spin in other words they don't they're not moving around they're not working and yea I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these women never think about that you know because Solomon he was the bridge probably the richest man that ever lived why is this man that ever lived probably had everything the most beautiful clothes that Kara had but he was not even clothes like these these these flowers and things you know that we see out here nature that sometimes we just just step on firemen don't even think about him one time that God was the one who gave who gave the increase wherefore if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you in other words if he clothes though the flowers the grass out in the field if he gives him their color he does all these things because all those all those things are complex what happens is nature in nature is complex but yet God is in control of all these statement how much more will he me am not able to provide especially for his children even Radice man therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles see now we are all Gentiles so we are prone to doing this then Jesus says except for after all these things do the Gentiles seek or in other words there they get consumed by all these things so I gotta work I gotta I gotta make money I got to do all these things I gotta because if I don't do it then it won't be done take a deep breath breathe deeply and say 3 2 1 1 2 3 what in the world is bothering me 3 2 1 1 2 3 what the heck is bothering me [Laughter] so 1 1 I used to watch TV yeah for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things you see you know is that you have better things so why in the world worry I don't know between my wife and me I think maybe she might tend to be a little bit more she gets it from her dad she and she tends to be the more of the worrier you know and I just I just like listen it'll get taken care of somehow but at the same time she's learned that part from me you know to not worry but at the same time I learned from her that things do need to get taken care of at times if not the ceiling will fall on your head and the termites will eat your house which happened to me in Anderson South Carolina and and I thought ah it's fine it's just sagging a little bit but it's no problem termites were eating that whole corner up so sometimes you can be too calm you see yeah there has to be a balance God is a God of balance but seek ye first the kingdom of God the man you seek seek ye first the kingdom of God in every single thing that you do or about to do ask ask the Lord about it ask him Lord is this part of your kingdom right is this what you is this is this is this in your word does this agree with your working as a team and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you now look what Jesus says it's not that uh none of these things are bad you need to have clothes you need to have a food you need to have all these things it's nice to be able to drive a nice car and these things right sure but when you seek the kingdom of God first then all these things will be added unto you right now it's not saying no God knows what you can hand on what you can't handle there are some people that can't handle money and God won't bless them with money and there they're working their life in there and they're peddling and striving and they seem like they never get where they really want to get but it's because God knows you better than you know yourself god bless you brother brother [Music] God knows you God knows you in your heart better than you know yourself that's right now there's not a lot of Christian people that are wealthy now I wonder why you know we all work we all make money we all but why is it there some of them some of some of us just a few or actually have well I honestly believe that God really knows that they can handle that can handle the money you know and they know what well I didn't the money won't handle them right they know how to handle the money you see so and they know that they can be a blessing to the bride into the ministry around the world with that money there you know and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for tomorrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof can somebody tell me what that last part means sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof who don't get a little class participation but I want to I want somebody to tell me what that means sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof nobody [Laughter] it means that what we go through in that day is already enough this right the hardships of that day is already enough for you to have to worry about these other statements and Truong insane so you you've bothered end of the day you know us that we're getting older and just a Peggy I'm sure you feel this by the end of the day you've already probably you're ready just go to sleep there isn't they still all right so nobly you have to know she's still about twenty year old but you know why consume yourself above these things when you already have so much troubles going on especially if you still have kids living in the house you know you got the run here run there with them go here and do this and yell at one for a little while and not necessarily yell at one but sometimes you have to raise your voice up now she said I should have beat you okay boy all right point all right let's continue so brother Branham says in the Smyrna Church age he says here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of God this too is need for remember he admonished take no thought for tomorrow what you shall eat or what ye shall put on your father knoweth the things you have need of he who clothes the lily and feeds the sparrow shall be much more for you these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consisteth none of the things he possesses but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all material necessities will be added unto you the people of God are not material minded they are Christ minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy rather they are on the poor side it was so in Jesus day it was true and Paul's what in Paul's day and it should be true today now brother Branham is not saying that it's bad for you to have money now but it's just that's just uh things because I'm saying the majority of us do not know how to handle money that we let money handle us oh oh it's not it's not true today for the latest series for the Laodicean age is one of vast wealth where often the criterion of spirituality is an abundance of earthly Goods that's how that's the mentality of Laodicea today and a lot of people today have a such great opportunity to have more money today especially after the internet came out you can make you can make butchers of money off the internet Lucy and so as given layer Asiya an opportunity to have more money more thing to to fulfill this you know I know a lot of the olders older generation you know they the mentality was I go to a job I work eight hours 12 hours a day I not retired you know I work 40 35 40 years but the mentality now free younger generation is totally fit our family you know they were there they want money working for them and instead of them working for money and that opportunity is out there see and so that's the reason why I believe that's the reason why Lee Rossio has you know they have money and earthly things but that doesn't mean they have got my how rich the churches and goods but how poor in spirit blessed blessed be he poor for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is not meat and drink it's not material it is within us a rich man is reaching God not inwardly thing there praise the Lord David and I started with this point about seeking the seeking first the kingdom of God because as we talk about this kingdom amen we need to seek the kingdom of God first look this is the first and foremost thing thank you so that's where that's the reason why now in Luke 18 says verse 28 then Peter said lo we have left all and followed thee speaking to Jesus and Jesus replies and says and he said unto them verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house parents or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life ever lasts mmm so when you give a sacrifice when you sacrifice of yourself when you sacrifice even your own family to obtain this kingdom yes amen there's there's a blessing for that there's been a lot there's been a lot of people a lot of Christians would have done that and God has restored you know families and things like that and then he does the miraculous when you when you let them do the miraculous events but when you sometimes they're not just speak it personally you see sometimes we kind of let the importance of spending time with your children the importance of spending time with your with your wife with your husband and the important it's so important but yet when that time is gonna sacrifice your time with God or your time to be a church or your time or your time to read the word or pray you know whatever that is a hindrance to you spiritually safely and so we need to we need to put those things in priority I love my wife I love my children but I have in the past I have let my time with God be sacrificed in order to dispense um any timing with with my children or spend some time and then I realized right a second that shouldn't have happened you see I think maybe we should have just all spent time with the Lord and it would have been better but though so nothing my wife pulls me or anything like that yeah this is a honey I'm gonna go pregnant pray me to come here and talk to me a massage you know she doesn't do that it's not that she does that but sometimes you have it in your mind I want to go do this I want to sit down and read and then something just kind of just pulls you away yeah let me tell you you regret it then I feel bad why because you you were not seeking the kingdom something else was dragging amen praise God now so it's the kingdom of God external what the kingdom of is not John six then those men verse 14 that does man when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone so here we see example of the Jews thinking having that mentality they wanted a physical Kingdom that's what they thought the Messiah was going to come in and set a physical Kingdom and stop the Romans and take us back to the golden days of Solomon but Jesus that wasn't his mentality that's not what he came here for and he departed in other words he got away from that they were gonna make him a king I don't know how the details as to as to as to that but they wanted to make him a king so they realized he was an important person maybe some of those they thought he this is the Messiah gonna be the king no but that's not what he came in another example Luke chapter 19 for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost verse 11 and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was 9 to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear so they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately a physical Kingdom should immediately appear now joseph of arimathea in mark chapter 15 i put question marks here because i get i don't know you could go both ways I'm not sure brother brother wait but he was that he was a Jew and it says Joseph of Arimathea an honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of God came and went in boldly unto Pilate and craved the body of Jesus joseph of arimathea us that's the tomb that it was Joseph's that's what he says was buried let's see me take it both ways I guess maybe he was seeking the real thing you know with the spiritual aspect of the kingdom but being a Jew he could also be thinking the same thing as well you know physical Kingdom the established and all that so and in two more scriptures Luke chapter 17 verse 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come so the Pharisees come to Jesus and ask him when is the kingdom of God supposed to be established and looking for a physical Kingdom not looking at anything spiritual right he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation now what does that mean that the kingdom of God comes without observation the kingdom of God is this is being established it's being established even now and people have no idea that it's being stubbs because why the kingdom of God is a spiritual Kingdom you are the kingdom right the kingdom of God dwells within let me see amen it's a spiritual Kingdom and nobody will know anything about it hmm that's what I was talking to uh I think I think it was brother Joe and you know we were discussing how how things are shaping up right now Billy Graham's death and and the things that are taking place around the world and and all these things and in Billy Graham's death and yet people just go on it's just like another preacher just just just died and they have no idea what the significance of that is do you know that that I don't know how if any of you watched the Billy Graham's funeral service the other day was lying one of his daughters gets up and speaks and I think she's a woman preacher yes she is okay but what she said was so interesting and she said she said my father's she said my father's death it's much more significant than his life was that's what she said she said she said um she said because I seek the kingdom first she said because she said no now listen to this because we know brother Branham he typed he typed Moses we know he typed Elisha he said because his life typed that of Moses is what she was saying right he was kind of like the Moses went off the scene but now Joshua was the one who took the children of Israel into the Promised Land right and and and then she goes now the name Joshua is the name it means Jesus right and it was Jesus the Holy Spirit that is to take the church in now this is this is this is a nominal woman talking this way I say so you know how she brings out that his death is much more so and president Trump is right there the vice president was right there and yeah type type yeah type of Billy Graham as Moses right did I say something else and I've seen that's the way around her famine they have we the understanding of the Prophet know that he was what he was given was but they put him in that position right it's kind of strange to her name blacks name blog is that her last night all right people sent this out of them call out what so let's do this so I thought that was very interesting stone a lot of people you know they have things going on around the world politically and have no idea what's not you know what's taking place mmm but blessed are your eyes for they see from the short lives yeah and your ears for the here in the same and it shouldn't alarm missus Karras that's right right it should just cause us to be me already you know know it's Louise yes brother Louise me sir call me Louis - but you know okay boy you guys here's a little more than historical perspective we do know John joking on the Baptist he was proclaiming repentance in the kingdom of God and all the Judea said was stirring so the only thing that you said they had in their thinking was okay Davis rain is gonna start again and they're they're hot were the one to do it and it's not like there weren't other people that were out there leading revolts against yeah already sure higher education a matter of fact there was one even though I think it was an Angels remember ones who may have said hey this if this comes of anything you better not fight called his dog cuz remember that other guy came and took four hundred down the desert and he disappeared yeah let him know now that was Jesus what the old one that that was me and he wasn't revolting the people around him forever yeah kind of like you know the Tim Jones of that car well they wanted the kingdom to come I mean they wanted to came out there they've been ruled by fresh by Robin for many years they wanted some release Ron when I finally found a man they think we're at least I know since the death of though oh absolutely were under the needs intrusion yeah then and then they were under the grease and together and that's all they've known as a physical Kingdom right and if it is promised right try the God that brought most took them out of the wilderness the holes of the heater that there was coming a time right but of the Torah they were like we talked all about they look at the Victorian someone's coming you know when somebody or they just dies like that the muffler's come in just like in Jesus name and the way that I was saying I hope he was in hell so like I say there's two Spears in the world spiritual things I guess we'll stop it right there no real good okay all right so uh and so this kingdom of God is not something that is observable right first 2117 neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you nobody we will be able to point out well the head is the kingdom of God there is the kingdom of God no nobody doesn't know but you know if the Word of God is the new birth is the word Amen if you have the fever x1 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel this is their disciples speaking this is after Jesus resurrection so there look they're still seeking a physical Kingdom surely here and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons now to me that seems like uh that that there will be something physical for the Jews that will be established at the Millennium no doubt right yes mm-hmm and we're gonna be part of it as well well who's gonna be sitting with them that's right right I'm not sure whether your statement worth what you're thinking your part is going to be in the millennial reign but we are going to be ruling and reigning with absolutely that's less SIA over the nation's not just over the nation's absolutely remember on the truck it's exactly so we don't know the time they didn't know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his power right so he has he has control of all these things he knows but you shall receive power now look how Jesus turns it into the spiritual he said alright but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you right and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen so again Jesus showing us that he was more concerned about because listen Saints if the kingdom of God if you can't if you can't possess your kingdom amen this kingdom here right now however in the where are you gonna reign there like you see we are we are called to be kings and priests right now in God's eyes and that's the reason why I believe that we need to start acting my kings we need to start acting like priests and we're gonna we're gonna talk about some other things Lord willing next Sunday I see to me that's the new birth absolutely she gotta remember if it was so built on buildings buildings walls temples they're looking for a physical Kingdom which they will get in the Millennium and they'll have a temple you know there but then Jesus kept saying no moving in and then when the Holy Ghost fell just a few days after that x1 they realized Peter and said okay this is what is that I remember - there you say love should be my watch want to belong to the sale we bought new ones will they're back there in the lab
