[0:04] good morning
[0:06] god bless you in the name of the lord
[0:09] we're going to today we're going to
[0:12] talk about grace
[0:16] i told you we're going to pick a pick a
[0:18] topic so
[0:19] this has been you know we were on prayer
[0:22] and now we're going to talk for a few
[0:24] minutes on
[0:24] grace um and i want to um
[0:28] just pick a couple of items if you pull
[0:31] up the
[0:32] the first meaning because listen there's
[0:35] grace graceful
[0:40] you can do something with grace and not
[0:42] even be godly
[0:44] a woman can walk down an aisle
[0:46] gracefully uh uh um
[0:49] someone can hit a baseball gracefully so
[0:52] there's there's different
[0:54] types of grace then there's
[0:57] disgrace then
[1:00] we've we all are familiar with the term
[1:03] greasy grace the brother brown brains
[1:06] the greasy grace we're not going to talk
[1:07] about greasy grace yet but we got to
[1:08] bring it in
[1:09] but we're going to talk about grace now
[1:12] the word grace
[1:14] is uh even from the hebrew lexicon
[1:16] there's one up above that i think in
[1:18] there brothers
[1:20] should be said the strong's number 25
[1:23] 80. there we go and it
[1:26] is favor charm favor
[1:30] grace elegance favor and acceptance
[1:33] so we're looking at favor finding favor
[1:36] with god
[1:38] and now like i said before don't think
[1:39] about disgrace and greasy grace let's
[1:41] think about
[1:41] grace just for a minute see that word at
[1:44] the bottom it says
[1:45] acceptance now let's go to the
[1:48] uh definition of grace in the webster's
[1:51] dictionary
[1:53] and we see brother branham tells us it
[1:55] is unmerited
[1:56] divine assistance so when you put that
[1:58] divine in there
[2:00] that has to be from god amen
[2:04] and it's not disgrace it's not
[2:06] gracefully walking it's not it's grace
[2:08] it's unmerited favor
[2:10] you didn't do anything to get this now
[2:12] this fits really good into the plan of
[2:14] redemption that we're preaching on the
[2:16] eternal plan of redemption
[2:18] because without this unmerited divine
[2:20] assistance
[2:21] you and i are dead because we're born in
[2:24] sin shape and
[2:24] iniquity we come to the world speaking
[2:26] lies doomed the prophet said and on our
[2:29] way to hell
[2:30] but look unmerited divine assistance
[2:33] given to humans
[2:36] now grace is given to human beings
[2:40] for their regeneration our
[2:42] sanctification
[2:44] think about that regeneration every one
[2:46] of us paul says follow me in the
[2:48] regeneration or the regening
[2:50] or the new birth
[2:53] there's a lot of people that are given
[2:55] grace but they're not given this kind of
[2:58] grace because
[2:59] only children of god are given divine
[3:01] grace
[3:03] amen because what happens if you don't
[3:06] have the new birth
[3:07] you're not a child of god it says this
[3:10] is a
[3:10] virtue coming from god so look
[3:14] like i said many times before man never
[3:17] developed
[3:18] grace it had to be developed by god
[3:22] right because you and i are not
[3:25] gracious people to a degree
[3:28] we're always pointing fingers it's
[3:29] always this one's fault it's always that
[3:31] one's fault
[3:32] but divine grace comes from god it's a
[3:35] virtue coming from god he knew we would
[3:37] need it and we need this right here very
[3:41] much
[3:42] divine assistance amen
[3:46] so as we go up the statue of a perfect
[3:47] man we need that divine assistance even
[3:50] after the new birth
[3:52] to get us to where we're going and look
[3:55] at this last one
[3:58] approval without grace
[4:02] we're not approved without grace we're
[4:05] sinners
[4:07] and we are sinners but saved by grace
[4:11] all right everybody with me on that and
[4:13] i want you to look we're going to look
[4:14] at a couple of
[4:15] of uh examples that are that are
[4:18] wonderful in the bible
[4:20] let's go to genesis 6 verse 8
[4:24] it says but noah found grace in the eyes
[4:27] of the lord there's only one man out of
[4:29] billions of people
[4:30] that found grace in the eyes of the lord
[4:32] in other words he found acceptance
[4:35] he failed now listen there's one thing
[4:39] it if we say it's unmerited divine
[4:41] assistance given to humans
[4:43] now you must accept that if it's in your
[4:46] regeneration
[4:48] if it's in your new birth or your
[4:49] sanctification you've got to accept it
[4:51] first
[4:53] you've got to accept grace if you don't
[4:55] accept grace then it's not going to do
[4:57] you any good
[4:58] because if you don't accept grace and i
[5:01] was reading in job
[5:03] if you'll read job if you read critical
[5:07] the critical side of job he's a pretty
[5:10] self-righteous guy
[5:12] i didn't do this i didn't do that i
[5:14] didn't do this i didn't do that and then
[5:15] the other three they're accusing him of
[5:17] all kind of things and
[5:18] then thank god elihu showed up and just
[5:21] kind of told them all to shut up
[5:23] he said stand up job we're going to talk
[5:24] about this thing and he presented grace
[5:27] to job
[5:29] i've come instead of god in other words
[5:32] he would we know that was christ
[5:34] and then god met him in a whirlwind and
[5:36] said job stand up
[5:39] i'm going to show you some grace because
[5:42] in the position that job was in he
[5:45] didn't look like he got a lot of grace
[5:49] family was gone he was probably he was a
[5:52] very wealthy man
[5:53] all of his richards are gone and he
[5:54] ended up sitting on the heap of ashes
[5:57] of his uh probably his mansion that he
[5:59] was living in
[6:00] he was sitting on the on the ash heap
[6:04] and then remember satan comes to god and
[6:07] says now
[6:08] i'll really make him deny you
[6:11] if you'll let me touch his body because
[6:13] remember god told him at first he said
[6:15] you can touch all of his possession
[6:16] but don't touch his body then he's come
[6:19] back to him he said okay you can touch
[6:20] his body but you can't take his life
[6:22] so here is uh job scraping boils off of
[6:25] his
[6:26] skin and he doesn't look like he's got a
[6:28] lot of grace but now watch what happens
[6:31] in the analogy of job like we're going
[6:34] to see
[6:35] in the analogy of boaz and ruth that we
[6:38] see
[6:38] that there was a place and i'm sure noah
[6:40] the same way nor found grace in the eyes
[6:42] of the lord
[6:43] look he he had to do something
[6:47] to get god's attention same way with
[6:51] god saying hey have you considered my
[6:53] servant job
[6:54] satan said well you got a hedge around
[6:56] him i'll make him curse you i'll make
[6:59] you just take that hedge away
[7:00] but now watch as you get to the very end
[7:02] of job what happened to job the grace of
[7:05] god comes on the scene
[7:06] gives him seven more children gives him
[7:09] double his cattle
[7:10] in other words if he was a billionaire
[7:12] he became a multi-billionaire
[7:14] but he had to go through the process so
[7:17] you and i and everything that we go
[7:18] through in our life we have to go
[7:20] through a process
[7:22] to me grace is a process sure it's
[7:24] unmerited favor but you know what it has
[7:27] to do with you
[7:29] on one end asking god to do something
[7:31] for you
[7:33] you say no that's unmerited favor god
[7:35] just dumps it be careful
[7:38] be careful that makes you self-righteous
[7:41] and we don't have any self-righteousness
[7:44] now we
[7:45] we are righteous because god see we're
[7:47] righteous because of the grace that god
[7:48] gave us
[7:49] right grace is unmerited divine
[7:52] assistance given to humans
[7:54] so it's not given to anybody else a tree
[7:56] doesn't need grace
[7:57] you and i are the only ones that need
[7:59] grace amen
[8:01] or the approval of god so in genesis 6 8
[8:04] noah found approval in the eyes of the
[8:07] lord there was no one worthy why because
[8:09] he saw job
[8:10] i mean he saw noah he saw job david
[8:14] talk about grace
[8:18] he was the apple of god's eye and i'm
[8:20] reading in psalms now and
[8:22] you see that god loved david but he
[8:24] didn't love david with
[8:26] filial love he loved him with agape love
[8:29] and agape love is what grace comes from
[8:32] grace comes from the agape love that
[8:34] that david i know
[8:36] the integrity of your heart i know what
[8:38] you really want to do
[8:40] and that's the same thing with me and
[8:41] you he won't he god knows what we really
[8:43] want when we ask him
[8:45] he knows that we might want to ask a
[8:47] miss he knows that we might want to ask
[8:49] for something that's not good
[8:53] but noah found grace in the eyes of the
[8:55] lord in other words
[8:57] noah to me noah was praying this whole
[9:00] scene of noah is that he's praying to
[9:03] god
[9:03] that god you're gonna have to do
[9:04] something with this with this world
[9:07] because it's gone
[9:08] to pot it's it's getting worse and more
[9:11] evil every day
[9:13] so noah found grace in the eyes of the
[9:14] lord and it didn't change you know like
[9:16] i said before
[9:17] prayer changes things but he knew what
[9:19] noah that noah would be the one that
[9:21] would ask for grace that would ask for
[9:23] mercy
[9:23] that would ask for the approval of god
[9:26] and so there noah
[9:27] preached 120 years under grace
[9:31] he was trying to give grace to the
[9:33] billions of people that was on the earth
[9:35] during the time of the
[9:36] before the flood and that's exactly what
[9:39] you and i when we preach the message of
[9:41] the hour when we preach christ
[9:43] that is grace being extended to me and
[9:46] you because
[9:47] we're the only ones that need it and
[9:50] grace listen grace is not
[9:52] for the future grace is for what you've
[9:55] done
[9:57] but now to god he's covered us
[10:01] through eternal redemption knowing that
[10:04] we would need grace and the other side
[10:05] like i said
[10:06] man didn't develop grace
[10:09] noah didn't find grace in the eyes of
[10:11] the republicans and
[10:13] and magistrates during no he found grace
[10:15] in the eyes of the lord
[10:17] brother brown said he was a quack they
[10:19] didn't you know he was preaching 120
[10:21] years it's going to rain and they're
[10:22] looking at him going
[10:23] staying a cloud in the sky but noah
[10:26] found grace in the eyes of the lord and
[10:27] then
[10:27] noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
[10:29] to continue on to build an ark
[10:32] because listen i believe god extends
[10:35] grace to everybody
[10:38] remember it's unmerited but it's whether
[10:40] you accept it but remember the pardon
[10:42] the pardon is not
[10:43] because what is a pardon grace a pardon
[10:46] is grace
[10:48] there was grace extended to that guy
[10:50] that killed the person and all that
[10:51] the part that brother brown talks about
[10:54] the story about the abraham lincoln
[10:56] signing the pardon
[10:57] and he said all this is no good that was
[10:59] his grace
[11:01] that was his approval he was going to be
[11:03] that whole part of him being a murderer
[11:05] was going to be done away with
[11:07] but he didn't accept it same way with me
[11:09] and you if we don't accept grace
[11:11] but now remember it can't be greasy
[11:13] grace
[11:15] or disgrace it's got to be amazing grace
[11:19] but noah found grace in the eyes of the
[11:21] lord so let's go to exodus
[11:23] 33 verse 13.
[11:26] now this is a man named moses
[11:31] and this man named moses wanted to see
[11:33] god
[11:36] he wanted to see this man he'd been
[11:38] talking to
[11:39] for all these years because here we're
[11:41] at exodus 33 they're into the wilderness
[11:44] journey and said now therefore i pray
[11:46] thee if i have found
[11:47] grace in thy sight in other words if i
[11:50] have found
[11:51] favor or approval and that's the way i
[11:54] want you to think about it today if you
[11:56] have done
[11:57] it's like brother brown says and i'll
[12:00] bring the quote later on he says when
[12:02] you've done all you can do stand
[12:04] right when you've done everything you
[12:07] can do stand right there because you
[12:08] know what
[12:09] grace is not that you're better than
[12:11] somebody else
[12:12] grace is not that you're worse than
[12:14] somebody else grace is unmerited favor
[12:16] but god knows in your heart what you
[12:18] want
[12:20] for a situation because this is what
[12:21] moses wanted for this situation he said
[12:23] lord if i found grace in your sight
[12:26] show me now thy way that i may know thee
[12:28] that i might find grace in thy sight
[12:31] or favor or acceptance and consider that
[12:34] this nation is thy people
[12:37] and the lord said my presence shall go
[12:39] with thee and i will give thee rest
[12:44] but moses wasn't satisfied with that
[12:49] he just didn't want the presence listen
[12:50] to verse 15 and he said unto him if thy
[12:52] presence go not with me
[12:54] carry us not up hence that's pretty bold
[12:59] but you know what he's doing he's taking
[13:00] god at his word because god said i'll
[13:02] take these people out by a mighty hand
[13:04] and i'll put them in the promised land
[13:06] that's what you and i got to believe for
[13:08] everything even all the way up to the
[13:10] resurrection and the rapture you've got
[13:12] to believe that god's already said it
[13:14] and then that's the place that we're
[13:15] going to go to amen
[13:17] and then what you'll find favor in the
[13:20] eyes of the lord to me this whole
[13:22] we look at grace different ways but just
[13:24] in a nutshell keep this in your mind
[13:26] in a nutshell to me grace is adoption
[13:31] because we found full favor and adoption
[13:34] we found full
[13:34] favor that where god knows that if you
[13:37] have something in your heart to ask for
[13:39] it
[13:39] it's going to be for the well-being of
[13:41] the people
[13:43] the bride of jesus christ same way with
[13:46] what's
[13:46] what's adoption being able to speak and
[13:49] god
[13:49] being able to react well now that's
[13:52] exactly what moses is doing moses said
[13:54] god if i've found favor in other words
[13:55] if i've done everything
[13:57] that i've been told to do if i found
[14:00] grace in your sight
[14:02] i want to see who you are for within
[14:04] shall it be known verse 16 hear
[14:06] that i and thy people have found grace
[14:08] in thy sight
[14:10] is it not in that thou goest with us
[14:12] question mark
[14:14] so shall we be separated i and thy
[14:16] people from all the people that are upon
[14:17] the face of the earth
[14:19] look at verse 17 and the lord said unto
[14:21] moses i will do this thing
[14:23] also that thou hast spoken now
[14:27] there's adoption will do what you spoke
[14:32] because you've met the requirements of
[14:34] the day
[14:35] you've met the acceptance of the hour
[14:37] that we're living in
[14:39] that's what we've been speaking on on
[14:40] eternal redemption it has been
[14:43] on adoption it has been on coming to
[14:45] speaking terms
[14:46] and that god can honor what you say and
[14:49] it's really god speaking it but
[14:51] you and i are going to have to be the
[14:52] vessel that it goes through same way
[14:54] with moses so shall we be separated i
[14:56] and thy people from all the people that
[14:58] upon the face of the earth
[14:59] and the lord said unto moses i will do
[15:01] this thing also that thou hast spoken
[15:03] for thou hast found grace or acceptance
[15:07] in my sight and i know thee by name
[15:11] now listen he knew moses before the
[15:13] foundation of the world
[15:15] it wasn't that he just realized well
[15:17] this is moses no he knew moses but what
[15:19] did moses do
[15:20] moses had moses had come into a position
[15:23] that his name implied
[15:26] everybody talks about new name and all
[15:28] these different things you know you
[15:29] become a christian
[15:30] when you become a christian that puts
[15:32] you in a new order that puts you in a
[15:33] new family that puts you in a new way of
[15:35] thinking
[15:36] amen because you find grace in the eyes
[15:39] of the lord
[15:42] and i know thee by name and he said i
[15:43] beseech thee
[15:45] show me thy glory and then we know that
[15:47] what did god do god
[15:49] walked by and showed him the back part
[15:51] of of his theophany
[15:53] and showed that it was a man all right
[15:55] so here we're talking about grace we're
[15:57] also talking about position so let's go
[15:59] to ruth
[16:00] two verse eight
[16:03] because i don't want grace just to be
[16:05] well it's unmerited favor and then throw
[16:06] it out there there's a lot to do
[16:08] with grace god thought enough he
[16:11] said it 160 something times in the
[16:13] scripture and brother branham he said my
[16:15] whole makeup is what
[16:16] grace we'll bring those quotes later on
[16:19] but listen to this ruth two verse eight
[16:22] then boaz said unto ruth hearst thou not
[16:24] my daughter
[16:25] go not to glean in another field neither
[16:28] go from hence but abide here fast
[16:30] by my maidens now listen he did not know
[16:33] ruth personally at this time
[16:37] but watch this let thine eyes be on the
[16:41] field that they do
[16:42] reap and go thou after them have i not
[16:45] charged the young men that they shall
[16:47] not touch thee
[16:49] thank god touched you with a
[16:51] denominational idea or touched you with
[16:53] some wrong
[16:55] that's what god's doing remember this is
[16:56] the bride in christ this is the total
[16:59] example of the bride in christ everybody
[17:00] got that
[17:03] and when there are a thirst now look
[17:04] this is the things now listen
[17:06] this message and this bible is not do's
[17:09] and don'ts but it does have a lot to do
[17:11] with what you do and a lot to do what
[17:12] you don't
[17:13] okay everybody got that then
[17:16] look but he tells her what to do in
[17:18] verse 9.
[17:19] all right don't go in another field
[17:23] i'll give you everything you need right
[17:24] here in other words i'll give you the
[17:26] word of god you need
[17:27] and drink of that which the young men
[17:29] have drawn verse 10
[17:31] then she fell on her face and bound
[17:33] herself to the ground and said unto him
[17:35] why have i found grace in thine eyes
[17:40] you ever asked the lord that yeah you
[17:41] have you should have he said lord why me
[17:45] well there's a purpose behind all that
[17:47] why have i found grace in thine eyes
[17:50] that thou should take knowledge of me
[17:54] seeing i am a stranger remember they
[17:57] never met but watch christ watch
[17:59] boaz boaz had done his homework
[18:03] he didn't she didn't just happen up on
[18:05] boaz and then he just said well i think
[18:07] you're a pretty girl and
[18:08] no he did some checking up on her right
[18:11] right
[18:12] in other words he was watching her
[18:14] before she knew he was watching her
[18:16] amen and boaz answered and said unto her
[18:19] it has fully
[18:20] been showed me
[18:23] all that thou hast done unto thy
[18:26] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[18:27] husband now
[18:30] hold on a minute the husband died
[18:33] in moab
[18:37] moab the husband had died way out there
[18:40] in the world yet he
[18:42] somehow boaz had some spies
[18:45] that could what has watched her the
[18:47] whole time wow
[18:49] thank god for that thank god we had a
[18:52] boaz to do the same thing
[18:53] and how thou has left thy father and thy
[18:55] mother and the land of thy nativity and
[18:58] our coming to a people
[19:00] which thou knewest not heretofore in
[19:03] other words you come into a christian
[19:04] realm but now watch this the lord
[19:06] recompense thy
[19:06] work and a full reward be given thee of
[19:10] the lord god of israel
[19:12] under whose wings thou art come to trust
[19:17] the lord recompensed thy work
[19:21] because she didn't raise up and say no i
[19:23] don't think i want to glean here i think
[19:24] i want to go in somewhere else no i
[19:25] really don't want the water that you
[19:26] give me i think i'll get my own
[19:28] i don't want to do this and i don't want
[19:29] to do that
[19:31] no that ruth the bride should not have
[19:34] that attitude our attitude is is what
[19:36] the lord gives us that's what we should
[19:37] take
[19:38] be happy in what the lord's give us
[19:40] right and then what's he gonna do
[19:42] then you take him at his word and then
[19:45] he has to fulfill his word
[19:47] by doing what boaz says look just stay
[19:49] in my field you ain't got nothing to
[19:51] this whole story is that a strange woman
[19:54] comes into the field and boaz
[19:58] already knows who she is
[20:01] and he gives her grace she says how do i
[20:03] find grace in thine eyes
[20:05] that you should take knowledge of me
[20:07] saying i'm a stranger
[20:08] he said the lord recompensed thy work
[20:10] and a full reward be given thee of the
[20:12] lord god of israel
[20:14] under whose wings musicians come thou
[20:16] art come
[20:17] to what see
[20:20] grace works on trust
[20:25] and that's what we go back to adoption
[20:27] works on trust
[20:29] if he can't trust you with going forward
[20:32] he's not going to give it to you because
[20:34] he's not going to
[20:35] give something out there and then it
[20:37] returned void he said everything
[20:39] he had he would give and it would never
[20:42] return void
[20:43] it would accomplish and that's what boaz
[20:44] was saying ruth stay right here
[20:47] do the things you're supposed to do stay
[20:49] in the bible stay in the message of the
[20:50] hour and i
[20:51] christ will look over you and make sure
[20:54] that everything's okay you have found
[20:56] grace in my eyes in other words
[20:58] acceptance
[20:59] or favor and that's what you and i want
[21:02] to do now we want to find
[21:04] favor in the eyes of god so our prayer
[21:07] life
[21:08] our reading our bible the different
[21:09] things that we do
[21:11] but remember it can never be greasy
[21:14] grace
[21:15] right if it's greasy grace that's sin
[21:18] and that's actually iniquity that's
[21:21] knowing to do better
[21:22] and you don't do it or not doing it if
[21:24] you know you're supposed to amen
[21:26] but ruth did exactly what boaz suggested
[21:32] and he said well i've done seeing you
[21:34] i've seen you for
[21:35] for years i've been watching over you
[21:37] for years
[21:39] and you found grace in my eyes that's my
[21:42] question it will be the next couple of
[21:44] services have you found grace in the
[21:46] eyes of the lord
[21:47] amen musicians go ahead and play
