========================================

you know and this is a topic that we all should be able to quote you know right from the Buffalo this fact that this hidden actually verbatim from the bottle and interestingly you know in coordinate interesting new this is a phrase that program didn't even use until 1960 it took him awhile you can say this phrase exactly like the way it is faith of our fathers faith of these fathers anything like that he didn't even say until 1960 what is that it's something that we've got to come to try and so down at the bottom I put this little quote for Paul speaking this to Timothy he said and he said the god of Our Fathers has chosen thee that thou should us know his will and see that just one and should us hear the voice of his mouth in that a good quote for somebody tell somebody but he is in this quote easily the god of our fathers you think about how you know even Paul is kind of looking back to a face that people that had gone before him believers and so we've looked back at the original that original face of the first church age to what what they believed their original doctrine that we've got to go back to you yeah I'm the core and y'all never go where the way he's preached brotherly this morning with the air is coming right back okay thank you yeah you don't mind I've noticed that we expanded the city school class a little more so welcome the other class the faith of our father of the father so just a little background what is faith because we're talking about we want to talk about this morning how do we get the faith of the father's yes if they're so important and what is faith and how do you get it and we you know that that scripture Hebrews 11:1 is it is very familiar to us all faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so now if you put that to to participate faith your faith is the evidence of the new birth your faith isn't evidence why is it evidence because this is substance it is the substance it's the thing this faith is the substance of God himself inside of you escalations 2:20 when you believe because his own he begins to believe it inside of you right faith is the substance the so brother Branham in that in their very first sermon that one of the you know the first sermon he recorded way back when and he was talking about faith he began to explain that story that we all know so well they he explained it a small sister that was seeking healing that if you have faith you know all things are possible him to believe and he said I can you move this off and she said no and he said well how I can do it and my face that substance the substance face which proves that faith is a it's actually something real is not something imaginary that we just like it's just the philosophy or something like in the early church that the Gnostics and so forth believe that you know all these philosophy and things about the more knowledge you could accumulate that the higher you would grow at everything but faith this is something real and so they demonstrate that he actually reached out with his faith and cause that that thing that was hanging by string to actually move and then he told the story that we got here this quote that if ever my barley knife Barlow knife and I'm Barbie Barlow we're not is only shelf at home but I believe that it's in my pocket you know that you know that causes a lot of people will stone yes but that's how how real faith is faith is is like a it clicked something into place to allow something to operate through it faith is is like a Dow u-turn to get the receiver lined up and so he demonstrated that if if the Barlow knife is on the shelf at home and you forgot it and you believe it then God can put it in your pocket because you believe it wow that's that's far-fetched that's amazing but yeah is true faith actually will make things happen faith and now brother Branham had do you talk about that he'll explain your faith in God's by his faith he said when then you know we've talked about this before come up in the prayer line and she can have her eyes crossed with his face he could uncross her eyes later on that cross back again but when God's faith took hold they would stay crossed his faith you know because he was a man of great faith he could he could do things like that that you know for us it's honestly it's almost you know it seems a little bit out of reach but yeah if you believe the scripture says all things are possible and so the faith of the fathers really is is something that's given to believers that are have reached a maturity because you wonder why why doesn't everybody have all of these different things because God is looking you know he's not gonna give something he's not gonna give the car keys to you if you're gonna go drive it off in a ditch he's not gonna give things to you if you don't know how to wield it and how to use it and what not so that the faith of the father's is there's a lot involved with that you see so let's read this quote real quick he said in faith in faith is the substance he said here in my pocket I think there's an old Barlow knife I've carried for years no I do not see that knife I did not feel that knife I did not taste that knife I did not smell that knife but I know that knife is in there how do you know because I believe it's in there now if it is not in there faith will put it in there if it's not there that chokes you I know but that's true if you believe all things are possible you afraid to take God friends you're scared now I'm out of lift that knife laying on the dresser this is sure of that nice is on the dresser right now if I believe it with all my heart it'll be in my pocket that Junction but God is able to put it there if you believe it that judge has done it but yeah we're supposed to take a body change how do we take a body change you're gonna take a body change by faith by believing something that seems impossible how do you get that faith that's what we're gonna talk about this more faith is the substance I say message brother I said if you have your faith according to your faith be it any is that right no matter how you feel you're healed in that no matter what you see you see what I mean nothing can take it out of your heart and I ain't turning it's over and I'm gonna be loud on that report well if you didn't understand it I understand no that's fine I think it's behind that way well then this right there maybe it's ours that might come from as long as they're right no matter how you feel you're here leaning out there's nothing you take it out of your heart you know that it's just a positive act right if you could only see a friend something would take place you could only know what I'm talking about something would react right now see it's a part that is right there just as positive as these other five senses these are the natural man they give God the natural man and be wrong but God so faith faith is a substance it's something is something real they can move things that can cause a reaction they'll call the reaction in your life it can change you if you just believe God work so out of how do you get faith faith comes by hearing and this is this is something I kind of want to stress to you know you can put the word right in front of somebody you can say that there's one God you must be baptized available Jesus Christ that all the different things that maybe we loaned us as simple truths but yet if someone is lacks the hearing and they won't be able to hear it and so they won't be able to your faith faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word so you can play the word ride from somebody but there it's like a something's over their eyes or something it's blocking it for the a here and what that is is all the hatred teaching the carnal doctors opinions that have blinded their eyes so when you take when you take somebody felt when God lifts the veil from their eyes you can begin to see it allows the light to come here so we'll see in a second how that that the face produces the light or our faith allows the light to come and we'll say like that and you know you that's why you can't argue somebody into the message or eight to ET anything because it takes God to take that to lift that veil from their eyes so they can actually hear what you're saying a lot of times you know you'll talk to somebody and it seems like you're making no cover a fantastic explanation or whatever but but it's just like there's available that something's sitting in between so faith comes by hearing and you can hear what the message is hear what the gospel is saying then it'll produce pain he said and this is this is little storability I was talking about how Hannah went to to heal I went down to the temple to get to pray for a child and she's crying out to God to produce a child in her and look up her mom said she knew that she's gonna have that child when the priest said she said she see the doctor explanation I'm not gonna go strong drink but I'm praying that the Lord take away my our fruits now watch he said the Lord draining you the Lord bless me this is what he lied a priest to say to her and that's all she more than nothing again I'm talking about how you get faith no one's gods priest gods priests that announced blessings on her she was at the house of God she was at the house of God and the priests announced blessings on him and he said the Lord granted you the Lord bless you now God could have put the baby in Iran don't make any difference whether it happened right there or not she had done words something our faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God she accepted it or right then with home rejoice Brady God going that the baby and then nine months little sang was born is that right why why she took God at his work she believed faith comes by hearing hearing the Word of God she heard him citing the Lord granted you the Lord blessed and she grabbed all of that and and and really I'm getting to a kind of an important concept is because stumbles a lot of people that faith comes by hearing the word because that is a big stumbling block for a lot of you a lot of people think that faith comes by by feelings and sensations in that and getting in a church service and feeling kind of normal but if you don't have the word house paint gonna go if you feel something you might have you might feel confident for a little bit but faith is gotta be for the long term Nathan's got to be when you're down in the lines there my name we get thrown into the fiery furnace like like three of your children where the circumstances aren't really set up for you to feel good at about things I think is something that faithless got to be something real okay not just something that is built on an emotion or whatever and so this dismisses this quote my brother I'm sitting persevered he said this if every sick person in here tonight could just have faith in God like George watchman did your Dell where that stands before me tonight we're at the Melton way some way you could cross it that's that's a big old statement right there no matter what your opposition is you would still crossing you would be persistent so persistent till that cancer two more whatever it is would never be able to stand there because you could cross over to the promise that God I give you meaning can only be persistent after they have heard from God you can only be persistent after you've heard the word after you've heard the word faith is only based on the Word of God because faith comes by hearing the Word of God you can't base your face on while I was in a good church service man in it and it was a lot of fun jumping around or anything you think that I'm serious that seemed real simple but yeah so many of them maybe even unconscious maybe even unconscious to the base our faith or whatever something other than the Word of God like to play I'm serious because you know you're talking to people sometimes and and they begin to really push back on the idea that the Word of God is what it's all based on the Word of God because you can't have faith without them again this is this is a little stumbling block that I was talking about the idea that because everybody likes that matchstick where you like the people who strike the mansion in your home it if you don't have something to light it to you don't have to gasoline you know something to burn then the match is going to go out if you don't have the mechanics the mechanics you see makes a way for the dynamics when you have faith in something and the Word of God then it makes a way for the Spirit work so you must have the mechanics and the more mechanics you have then the more dynamics you can have which seems the opposite to the way you would think right so so that's why when you come to church if you come to the house of God and somebody that's a little bit elevated like your pastor can look at you to look at the situation and say well you need some more antifreeze you need your your your brakes are about to go out or your engine is about to blow up you don't put some omen and they can look at the situation and say there's a problem there somewhere and and then and then the word the priest at that's why the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart many times the ministry is I said it was the minister but many times it's really not even the minister it shouldn't be it's God speaking through that minister to discern situations to discern things that make the mister don't even know about yeah that's really the way it should work is that the minister is not even that's what I like if the Minister it is is that he ate him there he's supposed to be out of way the gift is to get yourself out of the way so that God can use you then and I probably many times as we get too much in the way but if you get out of the way then the work and discern the problems that are in the church and and call out problems like new suspensions wrong there his office was messed up or whatever and and then preach that word and begin to lay a foundation so that people and the work the spirit can work the more mechanics you have the more life makes it real simple it's morning the more the more gasoline you have less the mechanics the more mechanics then the more light yeah yes strike if you strike that match God's knocking at the door if there's nothing there you just say well I don't even know anything about God I don't know you've got to hear the work so that you can say well okay now I know like like for example service II now we know when the Spirit strikes that pile of dead our gasoline you know then then it opens up when you really see Sir Percy okay and I'm on that because I've been talking to my kids about that the when you see that and the reason I'm talking about I was telling my kids about elves because there's a lot of opposition to that in them well but when you see servicing it opens up all sorts of things begin to realize why Jesus had to be born a virgin birth the original problem was in the garden what what how everything in the scripture ties together and that's how it is with all with any revelation when God ignites it and it will produce something so you can't a point is you can't you can't have to have a great movie of a spirit to see something miraculous you got to have that that word lay in your heart so back to the faith of the fathers why do we need that you're just kind of looking down through the seven churches and talking about life how you can't believe if window blinders come off of your eyes then you begin liking come in and you can see so what happened thousands of seven churches especially in the dark ages that's why it's called the dark ages so the light was the kind of hills covered up people's understanding was covered up so they could they it was this about all eating down until they hardly had any understanding of anything and you were in Sydney hey Bailey hope he'll only anything with just some of the just the basic fundamentals of Christianity it had all been eaten down and so without without that without the mechanics how would somebody in the Dark Ages be able to take a body change or things like that it would be impossible you see you got up to for the changing of the body for the changing to get your spirit lined up you you've gotta have the word and you gotta believe it so we said the nikah and this money interchange the Nicolaitans kept smothering the amount until the dark ages Luther's a - brought out the first step of grace a little light began to shine then come forth after that come John Wesley with sanctification road a little brighter and then come the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the Pentecostals bringing back again the faith of the Father but they could not keep it that way thus they had to organize it and then they started it right back into Nicolay it's in here so you see how God working through these men began to bring back but come back to John with Martin Luther John Wesley back to the moment come back to that original face bringing back but yet though still one seems to be tied up which is why God had two percent of profit leasing John one one five something about life and another scripture at the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of me and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not so what is that light that shine that light is the word but he wasn't the Walker from the beginning he was he was the water and that light that shines out is the Word of God made manifest so that's what that life you can see a home that's what this seven church ages this char signifies that the light is just a little bit of light in the dark ages eaten down and then it comes back until in Laodicea that line is pushed out of the the church system is pushed out outside a candle and you can see how there's just going to be a very small little group of people they come back to that full faith of the father's that believe the other I said in a resume of the ages talking about the dark ages and indeed for about 1,000 years the church went into the depth of blackness knowing the depths of Satan down here that you can see exactly where the nominal church was in the dark ages they left the Word of God entirely except for names and titling dhaniya than a few scriptural principles they twisted what they did take out of the Bible by changing his meaning the College of Bishops obsession with vast treatises that books declared himself infallible and they received revelation from God and spoke as done to the people all this was talked to the priest who through fear made the people believe it to the sink or the death race communication which might be worse than death it was now the church with the insured voice that took over and wild with power they drank the blood of the martyrs until the true Christians were all but exterminated and it was hardly any word left to see what comes with hardly a word left that little manifestation of the Holy Ghost our meaning were left and little manifestation of all the goats but the true vine struggled and survived God was faithful to the little flock and in spite of what role might do to their bodies God the spirit within them and the light of the truth shown back by the Holy Ghost Empire now there's another little stumbling block is that is that the idea that well they they couldn't have the new birth back in these ages they believed the word for their day and that produced like not as much light as there should be in this day because of the fewer amount of the less amount of mechanics the less gasoline will produce less life then a whole big only container won't bathtub fulla or whatever go so I'm getting to what is the faith of the father that brother Hank said and turn on the light he said these signs shall follow them to believe that's what Jesus said my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues these signs shall follow them that we shall follow them they say it's all right for the Apostles not for us that's a glare you see where that is that's saying that it's all right for the followers but I don't know if the faith of the father's could be made manifest again when you say it's all right to the impossible but not for us jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe to all the world I remember on that day that cold pre-flight free light will not dry Tennessee up today ving denies the scene it's the fondness upon the earth the business it's time for God to rise and turn on the light again make his word to lead them certainly like that cold cream won't ripen the green it certainly won't it's time for God to rise and turn on the light again how is it going to turn the like it turns the light on by order of the more words you have more like if you believe it that's another danger to the danger of just being an intellectual because I pulse it you can have all understand all mysteries and I have all knowledge and everything but yet you haven't really given yourself over to the over you have an open the door we haven't truly believed it and it's just you know really you can tell I think I really did forget to differentiate between intellectualism and a real faint is they'll produce a real faithful producing weakness because of the election ilysm just make something where you want to tell everybody how much you know and put people down but if it's real face you try to build one another up instead of putting push it consists on my down under your phone and and make it I'm like well you you don't know all the stuff on it so that's why program priests there's a man in here that can turn on the light and he said they probably took them under the wise men that follow that like to Jesus's birth he said they follow the Word of God to the light with all it was the word that brought life so will why wasn't in the day not blinded by freaks it will fall a god-given spoken words and they see the bullets of the power of God within this hour is that that's what produces life and then he told that story of the down in that cave where the little little girl got scared because the lights were turned off when I was alone then little brother there that said don't fear your little sister there's a man here I can turn on the light now of course the man our little brother was brother branham day that cried out to the bride don't fear there's a man here they can turn on the light and that's why we're not you know everybody says well you guys are following the main well you really honestly we're the only group that is not following me we're following God himself and came down and and and used people's lives he is brother Brennan's lives and now the powerful ministry to speak a word that will turn on the light so that you can see clearly and so what's it gonna do all the children back to the faith of the Father Pentecostal father back to the original faith he talks about how through the church changes day that the church is messengers stayed directly with it and was pushed out it's dated right with with the work that they had for their day even though things got screwed love things fell off all known to be seven churches until we get to the end and then God sent a prophet to take us back to the original faith the Holy Ghost is for whosoever will alien olive is in God's will for it to just be a holy man is the Holy Ghost amongst our people that's warning is showing signs and wonders that same church that evening star will reflect the same like the morning star just like that that vision brother Branham said eyes and said he he had of the like two Brides coming to a personal parading you know that he saw the bride in it that be so here's the scripture that we're all here for meeting with we hold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the pump before the coming of the Great and rippled a little or any shall turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with her so the word the word fate though the father's that exact phrase is not unity where the Bible that's where that comes from he's going to turn the heart of the children to the father's how is it going to do that house how did that happen let's talk about what is the Clayton in the park in Acts chapter 3 just that on the spirit fellow that they have Pentecost then get the priest boldly and in Acts chapter 3 verse 6 this is when they met that beggar sitting at the gate beautiful and Peter said silver and gold have I knew but such as I have give IV and the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk this next few slides I just want to really highlight not so much the power and the miracles of the early church but the characteristics of the people because of what the statute perfect man is and what the faith of the fathers is Tennessee is a mature church that knows what to do with the word that's not just talks about this not you know like like I said not just putting other people under their phone and saying how much do we know and not being like little children that that don't know how to act but these people more mature Christians that knew what the word what God one done with the word and they they like there's a quote and I think it's a statue of a perfect man where you said the slide is not from God and off they go doing it if they didn't have to go you know spend a lot of time on their knees say not are you sure this is what you want me to do they just they just ran with they they knew what God one down the door and they didn't have to have somebody convince some more upset sit through a lot of services and have the minister just preach and preach and preach until finally they were convinced but they were mature Christians mess with the faith of the fathers is it's not just a little a little child tossed around so so here in verse 12 when Peter began to give an explanation for this for this miracle he said you better visual I'm horrible year this I would look you so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk see that demonstrate I believe that he knew he knew of the mechanism by which this man was made to walk it what nothing to do with his own holiness it was that God was living inside of him and he knew how to operate that he knew how to make the thing work the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our Fathers hath glorified His Son Jesus that's how brother Branham always said that a real minister a ruminant Romanian Eve I will point to Jesus not to themself and so that's exactly what they were doing they were they were pointing the way to Jesus the next chapter for when they they all have been decorum and Peter gave an explanation for what was going on and see you and you rulers of the people and elders of Israel if we this day be examined with a good deed done to the impotent man by what means gives made holy because almond involved and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him to this man stand here before you home and then he said this very remarkable phrase it seems to be lost on many even as in this day this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head and I don't want to point out something that this later the fathers was lost that that understanding that they had at the beginning that that means the mysteries that they held was the lost and it's Neil all the way up to here with mother Brenda k1c and begin to bring the full word to us this was lost what the stench of a perfect man that that there's any kind of growth process that there's any material and you can see it you know when you listen to people on the radio in and it for preachers they they preach that you must be going in which is fantastic they preach that you must be saved and that Redemption and those kind of things but that mystery that of a birth process and maturity Romans eight Ephesians 4:11 12 all of those things that was lost this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner and so Peters saying right there that he has a revelation that is appealing because Jos gonna build a church mitties he goes on to tell about his revelation of who Jesus Christ is and they Laurel and I need to acknowledge have been then that they had been with Jesus the faith of the fathers then Acts chapter four 31 32 when after they you know they feed her to Peter and then they went back and told the disciples what had happened to him and their faith was the giri's and then getting pray and when they had prayed the place was shaking where they they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word of God of the bonus and the multitude of him that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that offer the things which he possessed it was his only but they had all things coming I think that's one example that really these each of these virtues is not for the person so much as for others virtue is to give out temperance is dealing with other patients that you can you deal with other people get a hold up to brotherly kindness and you're laying down yourself for other people like we'll see here they lay down there all their goods for other people they just took they sold the property and laid it out so that other people could have subsistence customers over or you know have something to live on they had all things in common because they were loving one another they were there was a real one of the King from believing the Word of God and they were all you know who seems like even in the message today there's a lot of division and everything still but I believe that once uniting the bride together what will unite us together is the Word of God because it will bring us to get you know on the day of Pentecost when in acts 2:38 they were even one Accord but when the spirit fell like quicken that word there was no wasn't no division or anything they went out on the street and they were they were all unwanted for believing the same thing now we went unexpressed things the same way but we're coming to the same the same razor-edge faith which is what this represents all the way down holding and word ever Blanc and the pyramid fits together just perfectly we can to stick a razor head all the way down till it's home together at the very top just just raise your feet so that we're all coming together to it to one heart one soul loving one another loving God and back to the original faint fathers just like they do not not in any mature people what a mightier matures God going back I hope not if you're going like the Pentecostal denomination then that that that wouldn't at all be a bad situation why they didn't clinic up that could be is hard to say what I all I can say is what I believe that we're going back to the to the original doc last lesson 1 milligram who said the original doctor in a regional faith the original worker that they held back me so that's because that original doctor the original face will produce the original life will take things right back to the way it was back then and then I'm gonna finish on this with because you know I I think sometimes we get something saying going up the doctrinal illness but the doctor will produce something in like it'll produce a cure the characteristic of Christ and that's what the face of the poverty is the face of the Father says God manifests that in the end people just the same way as he was banging like like this example of Stephen and they stone Stephen called upon God to say Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord not this sin to their charge now that's got to be a characteristic of Christ Oh to have somebody knocked in the head with rocks until Bloods coming out of his nose oh oh you know it was a Ben stone that was a gruesome death because you being killed by rocks and somebody being killed in that manner the crowd more forgiving most people would want vengeance or whatever then they want somebody to avenge my death that would be the the carnal natural response of me but this man had displayed the same characteristic of Jesus dying on the cross they said Father forgive well they know not what they do Lauren lay not this sin to their charge and that to me is the faith of the fathers I'm going to stop right there but the faith of the father's it is the same characteristics being displayed in you that were displayed back there because the same word that they do you now feel hope and the reason that you hold it is the cost of let me let me let me just give you a quick summary reason that they had to face the father's is because that the headstone was bad that they had stone as Christ himself he was there walking on the shores of Galilee teaching them for three and a half years telling them things so that when the spirit fell on the day of Pentecost they already had all that water now so what what's gonna what would take you back to the faith of the fathers the faith of the fathers would have to come that's what loneliness is that the little one himself with the scene with a shout the voice and and so forth the Lord Himself will come upon the scene and bring a message they had stone himself that's what that big cloud that we did have a little wall signifies is that God Himself came with a message to bring us back to the full Word of God southern that original life could be manifest in his people and now this is a long drawn-out Sunday School lesson [Music]
