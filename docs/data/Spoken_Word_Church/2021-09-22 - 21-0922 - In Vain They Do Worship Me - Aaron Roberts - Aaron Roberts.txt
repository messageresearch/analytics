ministry that we have each one of our our brothers lord that labor in the word lord we're just so thankful for them and that we just continue that you bless them lord bless the word tonight lord everything that we say and do will be for your honor and glory we ask in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen so matthew chapter 15 beginning at verse 1 says then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition for god commanded saying honor the father and mother and he's he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father his mother it is a gift but whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have you made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition you hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draweth an eye unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men amen so god bless you you may be seated tonight and i take a little title in vain they do worship me and you know the word the word vain when you look it up in in the dictionary when you go back and and you look at the definition it means in vain means a an emptiness or a a hollowness or a uselessness and so you know he said in vain do they worship me so it's a you know as a uselessness it's a useless thing that they're doing or you know it's a shallow or a hollow thing that that they're doing and you know he when jesus comes here and and the disciples or i'm sorry the pharisees and the scribes when they come you know they were so enjoying they were so connected to their tradition because you know their tradition had had taken on the same uh equivalency as the law as the as the word did and you know when they come they said you know why is it that that you have your uh disciples not wash their hands but jesus coming and he said but why is it that you transgress the commandment of god by your tradition he said hey when he come here and he said the scripture says for god commanded to honor your father and your mother you know it's the it's the first uh it's the first commandment with promise but here you come and he said why is it that but he said y'all you you've made this rule that if if you say well um i would like to help you but i can't and it and it's it's very interesting when you when you look at it is they say well everything that i have i've dedicated to god well i can't i can't help you because whatever i would use to profit you it belongs to god has been dedicated but the interesting point about that is when you look at that if it was dedicated and if and if it was consecrated it was given to god then why do they still have possession of that's right so they were here they are and they were saying well it's been dedicated to god but but i'm going to be the one that's going to be the uh caretaker of it i'm going to be in possession of it but i can't give it to you and they said well you know because now it's okay because uh we've bypassed we've bypassed the word because we've not broken the law and jesus and jesus is saying but yeah but the scripture says to honor your father and mother and and so he said that that's what it says and so when you look at how you honor your father and your mother it's not it's not just by lip service but by an expression by an action so when you do these things then you honor your father and your mother but see when he take when he goes to the scripture and he takes this as a natural scene and then when he continues on in this then he comes to isaiah and he says see you fulfilled isaiah's prophecy because he said not only do you don't you don't honor your father and your mother in a simple thing that you could do but all of a sudden now we look and he said isaiah prophesied of y'all and he said he said that the people draw now with their mouth and their lips but he said their heart is far from me and he said it's the exact same thing it's the same fulfillment of the word that they do with their father and their mother they do with god amen and it's a very simple thing because you know that you would take care of your your your parents you would try to help them but all of a sudden he takes it right back to the scripture and says he said but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men and so i want to i want to look at this tonight when he speaks of in worship what does it mean to worship and so he said in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so they laid all this you know they lay all their emphasis upon the teaching of the elders now and when we go to mark chapter 7 and and jesus speaking to the scribes and the pharisees when when they come in and mark's account of it he says for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things such like things you do and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition so you know as jesus said hey full well you've turned the word down because you've held because when you you can't place anything god will not have anybody that's going to be higher than him they're not there's not going to be any other worship but god amen he's not going to have the word take second place the word will have preeminence he will have preeminence in all things so when he said you've taken it and you've turned the word down full you reject the word the commandment of god that you can live your tradition so when when we go back and we as we were speaking previously when when the word came when the people were connected to their tradition to what what they had been taught as we talked about before when the when the people they didn't understand what to believe because even when when they you know when even when when peter and them came to jesus and they began to speak even they had questions on what he had taught because the elders had taught so many things because the priest had told such doctrines that that they were confused on things even when they saw jesus come and he preached the word to him and then he he told him he said and destroy this temple in three days i'll rise again when he came and he fulfilled the scripture and even when when he fulfilled the scripture and he told him that he would do that and he went and he spoke to cleopas on the road to emmaus and he spoke to him all along the way and he told him what would take place beforehand and when it came to pass and then when he told the disciples that i'll go meet you in galilee he said go tell my disciples and peter to come meet me and yet yet they were slow to believe what was told of them when he when he told them continue to tell them what would take place and then when he told them that they saw him when over 500 saw him resurrected standing in the body with nail prints in his hands and he stood there and he began to talk to them and yet they were still connected to an earthly kingdom that when when they when he was ready to ascend they were saying are you going to re-estate you're going to establish the kingdom now when he stood there and he told when he told pilate he said listen he said if my kingdom was of this world he said my people would stand up and fight but he said we're not of we're not of this world it's not in this kingdom right now in this earth one because i have a i'm doing a work now a ministry now but you know what all of this will come to me i will reign over all of this one day but i'm not coming to that now i'm as a servant fulfilling the scripture but he's pointing the people back to what was already written but they missed it they're still connected to that tradition and even today we have many people that that believe but you know that's the one thing that we have to get over the one thing that the word is to do is to break our own ideas our our traditions our thoughts one because we still haven't why because we're still connected to a carnal mind we still have carnality so we still have thoughts but what does the scripture tell us that we're supposed to bring all thoughts everything under subjection to the word so when when we take these things we must look to see what god wants us to do amen and you know the word worship the word worship means to honor or show reverence for a divine being or supernatural power to regard with great or extravagant respect honor or devotion a form of religious practice with its creed and ritual the act of paying divine honors to the supreme being religious reverence and homage adoration or acts of reverence paid to god or are being viewed as god so when you look at worship many people think that worship has to do with uh you know coming to come into church and uh you know we come in before before the church service and we and we sit down and we read our bible or we listen to brother branham and we get up and we sing three songs and somebody sings a special and you know as brother branham said you know somebody has an outstanding solo and we hear that and then the preacher gets up and preaches you know 45 minutes or 50 minutes and you know we sing two songs and we go home and he's like well that's my duty well that's only part of your duty but people look at worship as well i come to church and i play a musical instrument or i come to church and i sing or i come to church and i clap my hands and they say well this is worship but that's not but that's not all that is that's tied to worship as a as a script you know we say many times people always said let's worship in tithes and offerings one because that's an action so that's something else that we do but many people don't see that as worship they just say well that's something that's just something that we do but no when when you look as doing a religious practice something that you do that honors god whatever that you do honoring god is an act of worship so when it says to give homage to something homage means a special honor or respect shown publicly a formal public acknowledgement of a superior something that shows respect or attest to the worth of worth or influence of another a tribute so when you begin to look at this to understand it's a is a formal public acknowledgement not not just um a you go to a certain place as you know we go to we go to a church to worship god we do but but there's more than than just coming into this four walls and worshiping god an act of worship is something larger and and seeing worship as something that you go and do all the time you know brother branham said in in in the in the message adoption you know he was talking about being in the in heavenly places you know and and he goes and he speaks spanish he said we are assembled in heavenly he said it means the position of the believer it's the position of the believer in christ and you know when we talk about coming into heavenly places it's not the position of the person in church but it's the position of the believer in christ so you know he said he said you know when i'm prayed up and you're prayed up and the church is prayed up then we're ready to hear the message we have assembled ourselves together as saints called out baptized with the holy ghost filled with god's blessing and then he begins to talk about oh brother there you are heavenly atmosphere oh what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere now if we were sitting here because if brother branham said one time he said he said in the pews the empty pews he said if we could look into that other dimension and see the angels that are here see then then we then we'd have a whole different concept of what's going on here because if we could look into that other dimension and see what's going on then you know what we wouldn't be so tired sometimes we we wouldn't we wouldn't allow things to to hinder us so much you know you know this time of year is is one of the most uh for a lot of people's the most exciting time of the whole wide the whole year they wait for this time of year amen you know why because of a eight-letter word you know what it is football you can't spell brother no that would be dear dear dear dear no it's football i mean you got you got everybody you got you got all the clemson people out here and they're riding up and down with tiger tails hanging out the back of their car you got you got people they'll go out someplace and sit and pay hundreds of dollars to go sit in a plastic seat somewhere and don't even have a shirt on to paint their half of their body in a color sometimes two or three colors and you know if you walked out on the street the way some of those people were dressed they'd rest you but you know people dress like that so they can get on tv you know those people you know they get everywhere they everywhere they go it doesn't matter what's going on they got their big g on on their shirt their car everything every every piece of clothing that they have has got a big g on it and everywhere they go you can they can't say hello sometimes people get so excited it's like how about them dogs how about them dogs that's all i can say they can't say nothing else why cause that's football season and you know what it wouldn't matter there's people there's people's been in car wrecks broke bones all kinds of stuff and you know what they'll get in the car and go sit in the sanford stadium and wait till the ball game's over with and then they'll take them to the hospital there's been people that's had heart attacks and they sit there and say don't wait when the game got ahead when they got ahead and their team was winning they said well you can take me to the hospital now you know they excited why because there's something about football that grips them and you know i mean there's some people there's somebody fell at one time he's an alabama fan and he had a tailgating rig and everything like that and he said if alabama played on the moon he'd be taking that stuff and he'd be up there because he'd be watching him play football because that's where his his team is going to be there they get all excited about it but let me tell you something brother sister sometimes what we do is the devil allows we allow the devil to put stuff over our eyes and we don't pay attention on what's going on but you know the man the the one that created all heaven and earth created all things he spoke everything into existence he sent his son he came and died on a cross that for your sins and my sins that he paid the price that you can have healing that you can have all things that you can sit in heavenly places and he's here tonight to meet with you and speak to you but you know what people's it's a like aaron tonight brother maybe he won't be so long but see we miss our opportunity all right come on it's like well it's just brother dale or brother bob no sometimes we fail to realize it's jesus christ when we've come together in his presence he said where two or three are gathered in my name he said i'm go i'm there in the midst so when we come tonight it's not just a tradition it's not just some idea but you know we've come to hear from god and he's come to meet with you and you know what it doesn't matter whatever your problem is whatever he's already got the answer for it he's already got your answer before you even call he said i would have the answer he said i would answer so you know we if we if we this reason that we have to get into this heavenly atmosphere and allow the devil the lord to break this spell that the devil has on us to cast him out why because then we can get in the atmosphere of the holy spirit and he begins to speak to us and he begins to move and it's like well it's not just another service no no it's the time that all of a sudden the heavens open up and the glory fills the building and everybody has what they have need of but he said he said do you come in here he said but if you're prayed up and i'm prayed up he said then we can hear from heaven but you know what we don't see that as an act of worship we don't see that as worshiping god it's like we're going to come in here and clap our hands no when we prepare ourselves when we listen to the right things and we feed on the right things all week long amen when we prepare ourselves and it's not just the fivefold ministry that's to prepare ourselves but it's for every one of us to prepare ourselves for church to come into this place and you know and it's just like you know it's it's when we it's not just a a ritual but it's a life live if we can step into that heavenly atmosphere and have the heavenly sinning in heavenly places to know what god will what god can pour out his his blessings on us amen brother brahman said did you ever sit in one he said oh i've set till i would weep for joy and say god never let me leave here just heavenly places in christ jesus you know you get in you get into the atmosphere of the holy spirit sometimes it's like i don't want to leave amen and you know what this is what it's going to be like when we get out of here amen when we tell you when we when we get raptured out of here that's where it's going to be every single day all the former things are going to be passed away but an act of worship an act of worship is the things that you would do not that as as a definition what you would do to show your homage to your adoration identifying who this person is brother branham said in in god's gifts always find their places he he was speaking of the wise man he said that the wise men are clearly identified that they are offering their gift to him showing that in their heart they knew who he was and what he was going to do for them so no wonder the first thing they did they fell down perfectly in order and worshiped him before they could even understand it they fell down and worshipped him and then presented their gifts he said that's the way we have real christmas worship him then present your gift presenting your body as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god and he says he said after the wise but do you see what after the wise men did that and he's talking about mary and joseph he said but we find out they that they accepted the gifts from these wise men no wonder they were called wise men they were wise they really had wisdom if if men today would just be that wise just as wise it takes a wise man to come to christ the man that turns away from him is uh is an unwise man but it takes a wise man to come to christ so they their act of worship was not just coming and and bowing down before him but their act of worship was that they brought what he was identifying who he was because they identified the value in him they identified who he was so when they brought their gifts and testified who they who they said he was and so you know brother and said that they were wise because they saw and understood that and knew what he would do for them now in in the uh in the middle ages and in our in in the world many times in europe we find out that uh you know they had the feudal system and some of y'all probably know what that is and and for those that don't know that's not the hatfields and mccoys but but in a feudal system is when you have a a landowner who owned a large portion and he had a castle and and then he would give out so much to those that were around him but when they had they had a man that was called the word is called a vassal vassal is the is the name of the word and it's a man that has authority but he doesn't have the the authority that that the landowner did but he had people under him and he had certain things but one of the things that this man done was when he went and he always wanted to make sure that he made his allegiance and he and he gave his honor because one of the definitions is to recognize someone that's a superior to you and this man he would always know the landowner and always want to honor him and show respect to him that who he was and he said through that the man was given favor amen so here's a man that has this man that has all of his vast wealth and all of this land but you know he would come and he would swear his allegiance to this man and he would honor this man and with through that this man was given uh favor through through this man and then he would be he would be given those things that he had need of he would be blessed by lands and all these other things so then if he had a small portion then all of a sudden he had a greater portion because of his reverence to the man to this landowner in the in this system and then he would be blessed and then when this man would go out and he would do the right the right things and act correctly then that he would be even even blessed more because of the way he conducted himself and so when we see these people that that when they recognize somebody and he recognized who this who this man was and that he had power to to do things for him and he honored him not just not just with his mouth but he honored him through his actions and in the scripture we find a man that does just that to jesus we know that the centurion and and in the book of matthew you know he he came to jesus and and he spoke to jesus and he honored jesus because he knew who he was and what he could do and he said lord he said come and touch my servant because he's very sick and jesus was i was was moved by the way this man conducted himself and how he honored jesus and he said he said i will come to your house and i will heal your servant but you know what this man had the same reverence as that vassal did in the feudal system and he came and he told him he said he said lord he said he said i'm not worthy for you to come to my house he said he said lord i'm a man of authority and he said i have servants i have soldiers and he said i tell them to go and they go they'll come and they come he said my servant he said i tell him to do certain things and he does it but he said he said lord i see who you are and i see the power and authority that you have he said i'm not worthy for you to come to my house but he said i know who you are he said if you just speak the word he said my servant will be healed and you won't even have to come and jesus was so moved by this man's faith he said i'm not seeing faith like this in israel i'm so amazed by this man's uh faith but but look at the honor look at and and this being an act of worship to jesus that he brought up before him and said lord he said you don't have to do that just speak the word and that's what he did and jesus was so moved by his by his actions and it was an act of worship to him he said your servant's healed and that's all he had to say and he said from that same hour that he was healed he didn't have he didn't have to come and speak to him but he was already healed just by his act of worship brother brahm said in the message that day on calvary he said forgive me my pentecostal friends i am pentecostal but my pentecostal friends has got to a spot where there has to be a lot of fast music beating up some bands or clapping hands or tambourine to bring up a shout he said that's only emotions they play the bands before they go to battle to get people in the emotion of battle he said i believe in music i believe in cal happen of hands but i believe in these but i believe in these things that's exactly true we ought to have that but you have left the great things undone he said is that self-sacrifice life that god gives in you automatically doing that which is right because it's right just going on don't even think nothing about it just living it then what you just you see what's going on you don't you're on the highway that's what calvary meant to you on the highway open up that day for you you know there's many people that you know you know and and and i like i like i like fast music and and i like wonderful worship and all these type things but you know you know as when we're speaking of worship you know like brother branham was speaking here you know you know pentecost they made it all about the the church and this and the emotions and everything like that but you know when he turns it around he says he said the thing that has to be done the thing that you've left undone is living a life he's living a self-sacrifice life we can have worship we have a great worship but the greatest worship that if you want to worship god you want to honor god is the best thing that you can do is live the life kind of life to live the life of of jesus christ i like to honor jesus christ where he has the preeminence where he's he's the one that's honored but brother branagh was speaking when he was when he was speaking of the of the pharisees and and the sadducees and the scribes when they when they lived there you know when they went about their their business and he was talking about how how smart they were and how how brilliant and the uh ecclesiastical and all these things how they how they lived their lives and all these things but he said you know he said they had turned the commandments of god in in in traditions and he said he said you you've made them of none effect and he said you know then when when he was speaking of the life that they had lived you know it's the right kind of life because when he was speaking of them you know the the life that the scribes and the pharisees live he said you know you could trace it back generations and and all of their great-great-great-grandfathers or whatever all of them had you couldn't put a finger on their life all the things that they had done all the way through you know you could you couldn't argue with what they had done but the problem is is when when the one thing that they had to hold on to was the word was the law and when it came through it there was only one way that the word would be manifest and and brought and uh revealed was by the prophets but they had gotten away from all that and you know then they they had to well we have to find out who's in who's in charge and well you know rabbi so and so says this and this one says that and you know then it all became so muddled up that nobody knows exactly what to believe and then there's like well we're going to have these um well rabbi so-and-so says these things and you know then all of a sudden we prescribe to these things and then all of a sudden then it becomes this is more important then then what the law said and then and then we see people that that have come and he says brother brahm says he said they didn't know what to believe he said believe me it's the same thing again it's repeated itself so the same thing that they done back then is the same is the same thing that is today you know many times we have people that and we understand that and the day that an hour which we live this is this is the things that we're supposed to take place well because we know that there's going to be a falling away but you know what it's go it's a shaking time but you know what the ones that that can be shaken are going to be shaken but you know what the ones that cannot be shaken cannot be shaken but we see this you know this where we have people and you know there's there's so many people that you know they they they think that that it has to be a certain uh person a certain personality a certain a certain church you know everybody thinks well you know though you know if you go to brother so-and-so's church you know those are the people that's going to make the rapture you know it's just like you know you know i you know i we're we're living in we're living in in the greatest time because we're going by the so-and-so's church and when people get up there and they say you know if if brother branham was alive today he'd be sitting in our church listening to our pastor and you know they they become so arrogant and and it becomes such a such a uh a rebuke the way people are the way people draw and it's like no no we're not we're not trying to look for man it's not looking at a man it's not looking at a ministry it's looking at christ so when so it's not it's not just one person but it's christ when and we get to when people get to the place where they can't see christ in every and every brother and sister and it's not and it's and there's more emphasis on this one than that one you know the problem is is we we get so people get so wrapped up and it's like well you know i can't go to i can't go to a little church you know then they start looking well you know they got 200 people in their church i might be able to go there oh yeah and it's not and it's not like going and sitting and listening you know where do i get fed where where where where is it the word being preached you know all of a sudden then it seems like you know i you know i can i see something there that i don't see anywhere else that's right and you know not ever not every place is everybody's cup of tea i understand that even brother branham stood up one day and when they were asking him questions and answers and he said he said i'm not the only pebble on the beach but when we get to the place where you know everybody starts to look at the external things instead of looking at the eternal things when they start to begin to look at things that have no that have no business in the in the plan of god in the house of god and that's what they get so wrapped up in then we begin then brother brown says he said the gospel sounds in the purity of its word and its manifestation and he said they still don't get it so when the word has went forth they miss it why because they're looking at things that have no place you know it's like well you know what i could go i wouldn't go to that church because their music is not just well you know what that doesn't that doesn't change anything it's like boy i love this church we pull up in the parking lot we hear the music it's like we you know we just come in and almost have to pass out earplugs to everybody so everybody can have come in church and worship and i'm not knocking any anybody i mean if people like that that's fine but the problem is is when it comes down to the word what what is what is that what is the emphasis there you know when when as brother way just as mentioned before you know when you have when you have ministers and and you go to these ministers meeting and you talk to some of these brothers and you and you ask them and you know it's like you know certain brothers and it's so amazing they've not read certain books or they don't even own certain books of the prophet and it's like you know they they i i've been in this message 30 years and it's like well have you ever read the 70 weeks of daniel maybe once you know and there's so many things that people people they don't even know simple things i like like brother matthew bray says you know have you been in the message at least two weeks he said well then you can understand this well some people you've been in it for 30 years and they still can't understand it and it's what why is it because they don't study they don't look into the word of god they've not read the word of god so when it when they don't look into it and it's not studied and it's not an emphasis then that all we do is come to church and all this is hair and dress and and all these things and you know we try to figure out you know whether whether our young people can go this place or that place or play ball or play volleyball or whatever people put so many emphasis on those things well i don't know i don't know if you'll make it and i don't know if you're going to make it in the rapture brother i heard your kids watch cartoons i mean you think it's silly but i mean people get so wrapped up on things like that i mean what is it i mean it's so it's so silly but that's what that's what they hold on to and what is that what what is those things it's tradition well because many times it's the same thing that mama told his grandma taught him great grandma taught him it's the same thing we're we're holier than y'all because we don't do those things well you know what you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling but some people they they who praise the lord i don't put up a christmas tree and and and you know and i've heard people stand up and say if you put up a christmas tree you identify yourself to the whole world as a heathen i was like well brother branham identified himself to the whole world as a heathen and then everybody gets upset i was like well you know that's that's the rule that you said that's the standard you put out there then that's the standard oh no brother branham is different no say it's another it's another tradition that people have because you know you know when you when you look at brother branham's life people people want to put all this you know brother branham was so great and he was he you know we we honor the the prophet we honor the office that he had but you know he was still a man and he still lived he still lived a life and he still had faults and he still sinned but that didn't change what he done they did not change the message that he brought that was still an office that god used and he still spoke through the man but that didn't that didn't change any of that but you know i've heard people talk about you know when you when you begin to look at these things and and you and you see that the kind of uh you know they they try to put brother branham out ahead of everybody else and he's greater than everybody else and and you know and then they come in there well brother branham could do things and you know because he was a prophet and all these things he's like listen he had he had to be saved just like you and i had to be saved he still he still had to repent just like the rest of us had to repent now everybody puts that he was on he was on a fast track with the lord and that he didn't have to do the things that the rest of us have to do and i thought well you know what i said when was the last time any of y'all ever stayed eight hours or longer praying because you told a half a lie when he went when he told the people that he wasn't home on the tax case and he ran out the door and he told sister me to tell him i'm not home and then he went out the door and he went to pray for that baby and the lord tell him why are you putting your hands on him why you put your hands on that baby and he come back and told him said listen i can't pray for your child right now he said i got to go do something and then he went he didn't he didn't run up to green's mill and just hang out for a little bit and get on his knees and say lord you know i'm sorry and jump up and take off but you know he went up there and prayed through before he came back to play his hands on that baby i said when was the last time you done that amen and everybody thinks that you know brother branham had greasy grace many times when we began to look at the well actually when you begin to look at the life of the prophets you know what there was a higher standard that he lived by and because he lived the kind of life that he did then god honored him and was able to do the things that he was able to do and you know sometimes when we when we begin to look at things you know well that's that's one of the problems that we have in our lives is because we allow things to get slack we get likes about things when we give when we give place to the devil and then when these things happen then we wonder why things have come to the way that they have when people wonder about they well lord i've got cold in the spirit well what is the problem the lord didn't move that's right you know like brother ram said and be certain of god you know when you come to these things he said you know then you just go back through everything and you stay there and you keep going back through everything but you know sometimes we say you know we don't have time for that but you know that's what some people that's what we need we need to go back and get down and stay before god until we get an answer amen and find out what exactly is the problem just like when the children of israel you know when there was death in the camp then it's like hey it's time joshua hey time to hold up we're going to stop right here we're going to start waiting this thing out we're gonna start bringing all the tribes by and all the families and we're gonna start weeding this thing out till we figure out who's who's at fault but many times people don't want that kind of preaching why because it puts too much pressure on but you know that's what the scripture tells us in the last days that's where it's going to be that's what the word is to do and so you know you're going to have you're going to have to come to church you're either going to get better or you're going to get leave worse you're either going to draw closer to god or you're going to be further away from god but you're going to have to make you're going to have to make that decision you're going to have to come to that place here in the in the scripture we begin to look at the the scripture that that came and as as we were speaking before you know the they were the old testament when when they began to look and and the prophecies had been to go begin to go forth the prophets began to speak and and you know they began to look forward to to these prophecies and as we were speaking before you know it was the prophets that came later that pointed them back to the prophecies that came and even even when jesus came and he began to minister then he began to turn the people back and say look there isn't that's what the prophet said and the psalms and as and as you know daniel was talking about he said i understood my books and he began to look back to see what jeremiah had to say because brotherhood said a true prophet when he came he would look back to see what the previous prophets had said so he knew what was prophesied ahead of time so when he began to speak he knew if he was right or not because his message he knew his message had to line up with the previous message there was no there was no deviation just like just like when uh jeremiah and the different ones you know when when they had other prophets that would come and prophesy wrong and they would you know then he would turn them back and say well let's look and see what they said what was previously spoke of and so in the scripture we see a lot of a lot of these scriptures that they begin to point back and you know then they begin to look at these things and people not seeing what we call it but you didn't have the eye salve if you didn't have you had to have a seer to point you back to that and you know in in the scripture in matthew chapter 2 verse 23 and you're speaking of jesus and and his life and you know that that was one of the questions that the the pharisees and the scribes in them had was when they began to look back at jesus's life they began to look to find out what the prophets had previously spoken and it's like when was he in egypt you know and the scripture tells us here he says and he came and dwelt in the city of nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene now this is one question that people that they have it says the prophet said that he would be called a nazarene well then they go back to the old testament and they all stood you know calling the scripture trying to find where is this in the old testament and it's like well we can't find that but in but in isaiah 11 1 says and there shall come forth a rod out of the house of the stem of jesse a branch which shall be shall grow out of his roots so he begins to speak of of the house of jesse and the and the branch that's coming there would be a springing forth now you know people people look at this and they say well when you look at the word the branch it means though that the actual word is netster netzer but when you look at that then they say that that applies to nazareth because of the of the names and the way they they were connected and they say well we don't we don't see it that way and some say well that's what they say this this scripture is speaking when you look because when they look back at this this is they say well this is speaking of him being coming from nazareth and then a lot of people say well i don't see it that way and then they want to argue over whether it matches up or not and and it's like well you know let me tell you something the scripture says that he said he would become that he would be a nazarene the scripture says the prophet said that and he come from nazareth and he was a nazarene so whether whether or not that scripture refers to that or not that's not that's not the issue the scripture tells us that he did come from nazareth and that he was a nazarene and so you know then whether you argue over the this point whether it matches up or not that's that's irrelevant because the scripture says that he would and we know we know that not every prophecy was written in the scripture and so we you know we don't know where it was written but you know i i honestly believe that somebody spoke it it had to be spoken somewhere and somebody knew about it and it was spoken and then when when the writers came when matthew and them came in there and they began to speak of that you know what they weren't confused on that that wasn't that wasn't just some kind of hidden hocus pocus or something that was thus saith the lord so you know that's all that's all i got that's all i got to believe it was spoken and it come to pass whether we're going to split hairs over it or or not that's not that's very irrelevant and many times people have taken the scripture and that and that's that's where they want to put their emphasis on these things he's like well you know brother madam said this here and brother madam said that there and they spent all their time trying to split hairs and argue over one thing and another and it's like well let me let me tell you well have you sat down and prayed about it have you read have you allowed the lord to speak to you about it and we realized you know as as brother uh aaron mcgeary was talking about one time he said you know the one of the problems that people have in this message is is they think we have to become apologetics we're not you know because you know we're not going to know we're not going to be able to dot every eye and cross every t because if you get to the point where you can answer every question and there's no kind of hiccups and there are those kind of things that just stand out that don't match up and you have questions and everything like that he said you can't have faith but it takes faith to take god at his word and say you know this is just what he said i'm just going to believe what he said i don't i'm not i'm not here to argue over the points or or whatever i know what god showed of me i know what god revealed to me and and you know you you may not see that and that's okay but i know what god showed me what god's revealed to me and i you know and maybe you don't see that that's okay brother brown said one time he said it would be it would be a special class of people that would understand this it would be people that had supernatural understanding you know it's not it's not for the world it's not it's not for the whole world to see these things this is from uh greater than solomon is here and brethren says and and believe now he said now jesus was rebuking that generation generation for not believing his sign that he was that he was had proved to them that he was the messiah no no you know we took that last night how he was the messiah because he was the word is that right messiah means to christ the anointed one and then he was to be the king god the god prophet and there was the spirit in him and here was a spirit in him now remember the ones who really stayed with the scripture teaching they recognized him but those who went off the other with the other church in their traditions they missed it see and jesus told those teachers he said you with your traditions you take the commandments of god and make them of none effect now though what would they do with their tradition today saying the days of miracles has passed that's a tradition there's no such thing as divine healing that's tradition that's not the bible i can show you i can show any man where jesus ordained his church and commissioned it to all the world to every creature and these signs shall follow them that believe now i want somebody to show me a spot of scripture where he taken it away from the church he said it's not there it's still in the church it's the traditions that's twisted it out and he said that's the reason they did not they didn't recognize jesus so when you when you began to take these things see he began to expound to them who he was and he began to open up the scripture to them and he began to make it known but you know they had to receive that and he said they couldn't because they were so tied up in their traditions they didn't see who he was and they couldn't put their finger on who he was they couldn't they couldn't line it all up when he began to speak to the 70 and peter come to him you know and p and jesus told him said are you going to leave also and you know peter still had questions peter still had doubts he was still trying to work everything out but you know what he had a revelation he said thou art the christ the son of the living god he said and jesus said he said blessed art thou simon bar jonah he said of course flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you now that didn't change all the other problems that peter had in his life that didn't change it he was still he still had a he was still a man but still had a temper he still had faults and failures but you know what he had a revelation and he said lord whom to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life amen lord where are we going to go amen we're walking in all that we see and we and we may not have all the answers and but we know might see everything but you know what we're walking and what we see and that's what we begin to do we begin to see these things and they begin to talk about you know the traditions that everybody had and the ideas that they'd been taught but you know they had to override those things oh you know you and i we we still have questions we may still have doubts about things you know we all still have terminals about things why because you're still in a battle but you know if if god has showed you one thing if god has brought you this far that he's going to continue on he's going to continue to carry you on brother bram says and faith that was delivered to what's delivered to the saints and he was talking about he said you've taken your traditions and made them the commandments of god and none affect you but a bunch of snake in the grass he said now he said we can't stand that anybody goes to hear that stuff is that he said he can just take his church papers and walk away he said it hasn't changed a bit the seeds are coming right on trees going right on the same they didn't believe him but but why was he right and the rest of them was wrong god was with him and when after they crucified him in acts 2 4 acts 2 24 he said you men of israel said let it be known to you jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by signs and wonders and miracles which god did by him in the midst of you all that's how they know he was a man of god because god was with him performing signs and wonders he said they were sitting back saying the days of miracles has passed there's no such thing they didn't believe his his miracles but nicodemus come and told them said we know that you're a man of god because no nobody can do these things unless god be with him but they stood up and testified there was no there was no such thing as these things the guy's a a mind reader a fanatic there's nothing to him he don't even believe in our churches he don't belong to any of them thank god for that he stayed where god wanted him didn't make any difference he preached the word uncompromised he throwed like john the axe to the root of the tree let the chips fall where they wanted to what we need today is an old preacher like john the baptist amen but you know we see that today is when when the word goes forth you know then they say well we don't we don't believe those things and he said you know then they just take their papers and walk away well you can leave well that's what a lot of people do you got you got people that they want to claim to know so much and to be so revelated and have a certain place and they're and they run from pillar to post and they never sat under nobody any length of time and they never tried to learn anything but they want to tell you how to live your life you know and you see these people and they so wrapped up in trying to tell everybody how to live and how to do everything and it's like you know the bible has a name for that you know what that's called that's called a busybody and everybody's in everybody else's business you see these people jump up the first thing they do he's like well do you believe so-and-so has the holy ghost do you see the kind of life they live and it's like well let me tell you something brother sister the only thing i need to worry about is whether i got it or not and you need to worry about whether you got it or not you know brother they always talk about how the old pentecostals you know they always like to they're going to discern your spirit by looking at you an eye and they're going to look you and i will discern your spirit but you know they you know they get so wrapped up in all these things and you know and you you're so you know it's so and it's and it's like listen you need you need to worry about yourself you know the scripture is it's a very interesting thing i was i was looking and you know um in the in the scripture when i believe was paul when he was speaking of a busybody no i might be on on a tangent right now but that's all right i'll be back uh but you know he puts murder and and theft and all these other things in that same group and it's so amazing because do you know real and what's so amazing is you don't realize when you when you people are well i'm trying to help well you know what if you're not if you're not led of the holy ghost to do that you don't realize you can do more harm than good absolutely you're not you're not a you're not a help you're a hindrance you can be right in the way you know he didn't he didn't say you know uh busybody's in the same class as being getting mad or getting angry but you know he's a he you know when he when he lists these things he's like you know you don't need to murder people well you know and then he's like look you're destroying you know you're you're a fail you're a thief and don't be a busybody either one because you can do the exact same thing what you can you can murder some you can you can destroy somebody's influence you're you're a hindrance if you're still because you know you can take something from somebody you can be you can be more of a hindrance and hurt to somebody then you can be a help well i'm just i'm just trying to i'm just trying you know that's the reason that you know when when you speak then then the life that that you live you know it's you don't have to preach somebody a sermon live a sermon and it's like well you know i you know the lord told me to tell you this and the lord told me to tell you that and it's like well you know you know you see these people and it's like well you know it's like the lord told me to tell you this and the lord told me to tell you that it's like well let me tell you something the bible said and he said and then you meet these people and say well let me tell you what the bible says the bible says is that forsake not the assembling of yourselves together well why are you assembling the the prophet told us that you need to have a pastor and sit under them who's your pastor you know where do you where do you pay tithes so when we begin to look at you know we've got people's answers and people people want to share with you it's like well you know will you tell you tell me where you where the life that you live it's like well you know i would i would much rather just just hold my you know just hold my peace and wait for the lord to speak to me before i tell somebody something because i don't know if they're in the position to receive it but i would much rather i would much rather just wait until the whole you know the lord you know it's just like paul when paul was walking and it was on the the road and the and the girl with the spirit kept you know was walking behind them and kept identifying who they were well you know he didn't just turn around the first time that she said that and said and rebuked that thing but you know he he was long suffering and he began to walk with that for a while and then when the lord spoke to him then he could tell that thing to leave her and many times you know we need to come to the place where we can we can wait on the lord and have the lord speak to us that we and when we speak to somebody then then it's the right time you know there's many times that pastors have people say well well you know there's something going on in the church or you know something's happened or whatever and it's like well the pastor's not said anything about it you know it's like you know and i know times that people have said things about brother dale it's like well why hadn't brother dale said this why hadn't brother dale said that or or anything and it's like why because you know what he's me he's waiting on the lord he's like you know you're not you're not privy to the things that he is and when you when you become the pastor then you can make those decisions but when people come to those things and it's like listen he said i'm i'm not in that position so you know what i'm not trying to second-guess him he's like well i don't want to be in that position but the one thing that i can do is is pray and i can pray for him then it's like you know what lord hey you know i just i can do this this this is what i can do because if not then you become a hindrance and then as the scripture says we should not have any schisms in the body but but all of a sudden these things happen and people wonder why these things have happened it's because people allow themselves to get out of place to get out of position amen so i'm trying to i'm trying to stop but y'all just pray for me but you know i you know because everything that we do is an act of worship everything that everything that we do and you know as the scripture tells us in in psalms he said he said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight you know and every and everything that we do let me be honored to god because you know the things that we meditate on you know brother brown was talking about the things that you meditate on the things that you feed on then it becomes a you know an act it becomes a word and it becomes a thought an action so it's the things that you feed on the things that you looking at and how what you know then all of a sudden that's how you live why because you're creating that atmosphere and so if we would come that we always look to god always look always have him before us you know the thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee as david said you know we always put these things out before us that we don't always you know get out of place but do the things that are honorable to god to fulfill the word and and you know to be led of the spirit here in in matthew finishing i'm going to finish this the the last part of the the reading here from matthew 15 when when uh jesus spoke to the the disciples and he said by their commandment by your commandments you've made the word of god known effect and ver and verse 10 says and he called the multitude and he said unto him to them hear and understand he said no not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that but thou that thou that the pharise no sorry he said but that not that which goeth into the mouth that follows with a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth the man then came his disciples and said unto him know us thou that that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying and he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up he said let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch and then answered peter and said unto them declare unto us this parable and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding do not yet ye understand yet understand that whatsoever enter into the mouth go into the belly and is cast out into the drought but those things which proceed out of mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceedeth evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts fault witness blasphemies these are the things which to follow man but to eat with unwashed hand and washing hands defile followeth not a man so we'll begin to speak in this when jesus began to to speak of this and it's to understand what what comes out of a man you know they were so the pharisees were so connected to the external to what was on the outside what was looking but god looked on the heart and he said what's on the inside you know they were so connected that that you know with the external and the life that they live and how how close it was and and all these things but when they didn't recognize the word and even those that recognized the word did not believe the word even when jesus began to speak to the the pharisees and the scribes and he began to point the scripture out to him and identify who he was and you know he said he said he said if i hadn't come he said you'd had a covering he said you'd have been okay but he said you've seen this and you've heard this and he told them then then you'll be responsible for this you don't have a covering anymore and they were going to have to answer for that but he said he said the things that were inside of a man not not the outside when peter was asking him about those things what's what comes from the inside the scripture says from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so what do you feed on the things that you do you know there's a a song and i can't and i can't remember who's saying it but uh y'all y'all might know it but you know it's a little song called every little thing i say and do ought to be pleasing to the lord every little thing i say and do ought to be pleasing to the lord and and what's the other part of it every every little thing in my life ought to reflect the lord jesus christ everything i say and do ought to be pleasing to the lord so when we come to to worship everything we all everything that we see in our lives we ought to see that as an act of worship let's all stand have the have the musicians coming i didn't think i'd go this long tonight but you know everything that we do i just you know that we see it as an act of worship that when when we see these things in our lives you know when you know when you see the certain times you see people it's got things wrong with them and you know it's it's so in medically people have things wrong with them and i've known i've known people has had it you know they had infections and and different things and and you know and and then they said well i'm okay i'm okay and they just continue to go on and you know and it's like well i'm okay i'm going i'll make it but you know everybody else around them sees it you know you're getting worse you're not making it you're not going to make it and then people people's like well you know i i felt funny the other day but you know i just kept going going then all of a sudden they take him to the hospital and said you know what if you wasn't here within the hour you'd have been dead and it's like well you know i i i thought it was gonna be okay and there's people that's this i i knew a man that he had epilepsy and you know he kept having problems with it and instead of going to the doctor he just stayed home and you know it's like you need to you need to go see the doctor you need to find out about this you need to get well then all of a sudden nobody heard from him they went to his house they found him dead and he was he'd got up in the middle of night went to the bathroom went back to bed and fell before he got there and it's the same thing with you and i you know sometimes the lord will speak to us about things and we'll say well i'll be okay i'll be okay and it's like no the lord's speaking to you need to do something about that when the word comes and it's like well you know then you know we say well you know i i love the lord and i want i want to do so i want to serve the lord i want to do these things and it's like you know you know when we come to church and we want to worship god and we want to we want to adore him and we we want to honor him and we want to we want to show that we want to magnify him and we want to have a public acknowledgement of what he's done for us but when he comes and he speaks to us and then if we don't act on that then you know what that's not that's not an honor that's not that's not adoration that's not a part that's not a a public acknowledgement of his glory but if we don't act on that then you know what we then we've then we've turned him away and we've dishonored him and if we and if we if we are so you know if we see things in our lives and you know we say we love the lord and we want to worship him then everything that we do every little thing that we do is an honor to him to live the life right and i want to live the way he wants me to live i'm gonna quit i'm gonna preach all night anyway go ahead brother amen i am thinking of
