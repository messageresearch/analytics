this privilege of being in the house amen Jamaica we a man in family amen we greet the family of God Amen and we're certainly glad to be here we certainly glad for the hospitality that we've receive each time we are here and not only that but it seems like my family is a part of your family amen it's a few places that I've gone to where I know most of the people and most persons know me and so I'm no stranger to you amen as a matter of fact I I say this and I say this everywhere that this is a place where my early Christian life and my life as a pastor and a preacher I was taught the message of the hour amen where I can extend that amen um wherever I go and um you know I thank God that um I've taken that gospel of Christ and the message of the hour you know I've been to South Africa Zimbabwe I've been to Zambia Nigeria I've been to Ghana I've been to Liberia serilon I've been to Kenya and Uganda amen amen by God's grace amen by the grace of God Amen praise God so we could tell you many things that Hasen happen in the field and back home and wherever we go but we certainly thank God for his grace and his mercies towards us and like our Prophet says that no church no matter what its practice he said no matter how intellectual or fundamental you want to be he said that church cannot strive until the Supernatural is made known among the people and he say something that you can talk to that can talk back to you so I said when the supernatural becomes natural in your midst amen then you know it's the maturing of the sons of God Amen praise God so amen very simple things we speak um the greatest thing that we can do is to take the word of God um by the light that the message has shown on the word and break it to the people so that our children cannot understand it you know if we say we preach a mystery and we think we've got a revelation of that and the younger ones can't understand it then the mystery is just in our head amen but uh Rebecca had to know for certain exactly how heac is or else when she see him in the field she would have thought she had seen a stranger amen but he's not a stranger to us today we know exactly who he is and the only way you can truly know who you are is to first know who he is amen cuz you're a reflection of who he is amen so we're going to go to the scriptures this morning glad to have my wife and um you know I greet you also from the children who you know we empty nesters you know children live now in Canada and um but you know because of the way Technologies today we've not missed each other we see each other we talk to each other many times for the day amen and so so we thank God for that experience amen so we want to turn to uh the Book of Genesis the SE chapter um Genesis chapter 1 and I'll read verse 26 and 27 and then we will move from there but let us bow our heads and talk to the author of the word amen our great God and Father I want to thank you God for this privilege that you have G to given to us to be in your house and Lord God every time the doors are open it's not the building oh God that is sacred but Lord God it is you in our lives that has transform us oh God by Your Word Heavenly Father we pray that oh God we preach things oh God naturally among the people that Lord God they might see Jesus Christ this morning Lord remember remember those that are sick and Afflicted those that are without this morning Lord God we the bride of Christ are gathered Lord God in your name we pray that You' be their midst this morning to feed the flck of God with the word of God and Father we thank you God to help us to move ourselves out of the way that you can be glorified today have your own way as we thank and believe you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen so in Genesis 1 26 you know it very well you could recite it and God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea I want you to notice that he said and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the he here and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created e them may the Lord had his Blessing to the word this morning you may be seated you know this is my third week here this morning and um you know I had to come before because we have you know just a a little business that we do back home and others are depending on us so I had to leave Fring and um I came on the 14th and um she came uh two weeks after then when we leave here here God's willing I'm going back home and she'll be going to see the girls you know in Canada but you know um she she had a ticket to come fly out of monteo bay and um you know just share a little testimony with you and um we know there's a bus that travel out of Kingston maybe five times a day you know you have different ones going all the way to the airport so going to the airport now from linstead which for for us driving would have been just about 2 and a half hours really but now it it cost just so small for you to take the bus and to go to the airport very convenient so uh I was trying to buy her ticket on the bus you know online to but the website was going all over the place and I I didn't get a chance to do it so um Monday morning when she was supposed to um fly out Monday in the day she had a I think one after some a flight after 1:00 so she had to be on the bus at 6:30 leaving Spanish town so I might call her to see if she was up and she was up so I said remember you got to get there early cuz you don't have a ticket you got to go to get a ticket but something said but why don't you go and check now if you can actually get the ticket and when I went on the site of the bus you know it showed me that there's no seat left on the bus oh my goodness so I I looked then that was a 6:30 bus I look at the the 8:00 bus and there's no seat I look at the 12:00 bus and there's no seat so I the only seat was available two seats available on the 530 bus now our her flight is just after 1:00 so I said oh my Lord what will I do now so I called her and tell her I said Hey listen we got to get somebody to take you to the airport you know and so you know this is the last minute really that we we're going to go and um you know so she was calling the sister that was supposed to just take her 20 minutes into Spanish down really to get the bus and so and to make new Arrangements but something said to me I mean pray and so I was going on my knees at the side of the bed to pray and you know you you have a notification on your phone and I hear it so I look and when I look somebody had sent me a text and it says so it was a script but then then it says but God but God and I went down and I prayed and I said but God you're are rich in Mercy and you give to us exactly what we have need of and I just feel that assurance that everything is going to be all right and I got back up and I walk around and I said well let me check again and I went back on the bus I went in and when I check there was two seats there so I bought one amen amen you know we we serve a God who uh make the impossible possible now I don't know if somebody drop out or but that's not my business I only know that what I ask him for he gives it to me amen praise God so I call her back and says well that's all right you can take your time cuz you've got a confirmed seat on the bus amen praise God hallelujah now we want to look at the word here that we've read in Genesis 1:26 and I'll go to Genesis 2:7 in a little while and I continue this afternoon to look at his condescending you know it says God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created them now God created not a man because sometimes we want to think that God created Adam no but God created man the whole man now this was the thought the expression of God that in the mind of God I want to be a father so I'm going to create man so when God has that thought that thought of God is eternal so God did not create just Adam but he created every every redeemed human being was in the thoughts of God Amen and if that is not so then when we get over to predestination then we can't find ourselves if we can't find it back in the thought of God so we were in the mind of God before the world begin yes sir so don't think that the scripture refer to only one man no but it refers to the whole redeemed creation now in the message demonology 1953 amen here brother Bram now putting that into perspective he said but your soul was made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image Hallelujah so you didn't come afterwards amen I was spoken in the mind of God the same time that Adam came is that right so there is a part of me if I've got a new birth that is eternal in God Amen that in the beginning God when he said I want man I I need somebody to worship me you a part of that is that right Amen in his own image but man in his own image see and then he made male and female before he ever had a man in the dust of the earth amen then over in question and answer 1962 he said now now notice in Genesis again 1:26 God created the the Wales of the sea he done everything and made the creation made man in his own image made man not a man the whole man hallelujah amen all of them in his own image see and after the image of God created he them male and female created him but like that amen so we notice then that now where are you in the beginning Hallelujah that day when God created man in his own image yes my expression from God was also created it's not only Adam cuz we think that he created Adam and then from Genesis 1:26 then he go to Genesis 27 with Adam but no you see in Genesis 2:7 he brought Adam from his thought into expression amen hallelujah but where were you you were there hallelujah praise God so Genesis now he said but then Genesis 2:7 Adam was first expressed it was form thought of God hallelujah that's what he was hallelujah amen physical tangible from the pool Gene let us says from the the the pool of thought that God have half man from Genesis 1: 126 27 amen so now he's carrying on is creation but the first that that first creation of man let us say but I was a part of it am amen so when I say I'm a part of my savior I didn't come when I when I come from my mother and father I I didn't come when I hear the word of God when God said let us made man in our image I was in the image of God not you the person not you the person but that Gene of God Amen that you will carry from the new birth you are already there Hallelujah so the exposition of the seven Church H he said in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the in the mind of God eternally so if you're in the mind of God eternally you never had a beginning there and you never add an end you're always there Hallelujah though not express until each comfort in the designated Hallelujah decreed season amen as each member came forth it become Express and took its place in the body thus this bride is eternal spoken word seed bride hallelujah amen and though as she's feminine in designation she's also called the body of Christ amen so we're looking now where we were before hallelujah amen let us continue to bring it amen but you see we were there before God wanted it so amen but the rest of his attribute taughts children should be Express w w without the sex act before that came in you were there am amen but by creation the spoken word until Genesis 3 when the fall is that right amen then everything is going to be spoken of is that right but you were before the fall amen you were before the fall amen so in Romans 3:23 the Bible says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God now amen in that expression am me Paul was really expressing something that was before he was now speaking of Genesis 3 but the bride does not come because of Genesis 3 you came in Genesis 1:27 Hallelujah so you said well but I'm bound because I was born in sin and shamed in iniquity you see that's what the devil tells you but what does God say to you I I brought you before that is that right you were before that amen so in 1 Peter 1:23 being born again yes not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which lie and abided forever now when the fall came amen you could not come forth by the way Adam come and Adam was a Son of God in the Old Testament he never he came before The Fall Adam was before the fall amen the life of God in you was before the fall amen but this man this is an unbeliever because he came in the fall you see so your life today is depicted by who is leading you if you're being led by this man then you're an unbeliever and even if amen there's a gene that speak of you in the mind of God if you're out of your position you're in this man there's only one way to reap the benefit of your eternal life you got to step out of the flesh the Bible says he that is in the flesh cannot please God nor indeed can be so you cannot stand outside of your position and said well you know I'm predestinated seed of God and I will not be lost you're going to be lost if you're in a backl condition you're lost is that right but when you're in your position you can speak like God speak but if you're out of your position amen and and that is why we need the washing of the Water by the word hey don't let nobody fool you if this word don't wash you amen you'll never stand in position is that right amen Moses had left them for 40 amen for for 40 days let us look at Israel back then you you see they they crossed the Red Sea and when they crossed the Red Sea what a jubilee they had Miriam took the tambourine anden they sing and they dance and holy dance amen but but Moses now went upon the mountain to seal yes what God has given to them Hallelujah and the people begin to look for something else just a few days without the washing of the prophet and they begin to start to look for something else that you know what they did they they took ID idolatry went in the camp they begin to take out their hearings and their chains and their their BRAC and their B is that what the Bible said and they melt them into a golden Cal and Aon said behold your God that take you out of Egypt why how quickly they went there because the prophet amen was missing from their midst and they weren't being Washed by the prophet so now they begin to dance the the same people that a few days back danc and holy dance they now begin to dance a devilish dance I like dancing but you got to be dancing to the right thing amen hallelujah and I want to say to you you see people said well you know it's all right Hallelujah if we put them back and and all Hey listen because of the spirit of idolatry when we took them off we never put them back hello hello and anytime you see they start coming back into the house of God idolatry is also coming back amen you you might not lie that but that's the truth amen hallelujah amen praise praise God now a dead in sin somebody who's dead in sin well list say we're we're born in sin and we are shapen in iniquity so we are formed in sin because the the human desire was involved Hallelujah so therefore you're annihilated from God amen amen and a man that's dying his sin is annihilated from God according to Ezekiel that's what the Bible said if such a one is originally Hallelujah an attribute thought of God in Genesis 1:27 then God created the whole man Hallelujah and a part of God's thought is dead amen amen abolutely but the thoughts of God is eternal amen hallelujah and so no matter what the devil does on this side he cannot stop the plan of God in your life H what the bride of Christ ought to do is to stand in your predestinated position sir the word of God hallelujah now people say today well you you know we put the message aside we put the the prophet's voice aside or we call it the voice of God and we we're going back to our Bible but we have the Bible for all these years and we didn't even know what was there it was right there written on the pages but there was no light Hallelujah and so this one said this means this and this one said that means that you know why because they're all in darkness but if the light shine then you're no longer presuming you know exactly what is there amen hallelujah glory in Blasphemous names paragraph 185 he said now they take the scriptures from back come on and God breathed the breath into the nostril and he become a living Soul now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of breath was he breathing before God breathe is Breath of Life into him what kind of breath he was a breathing living man well then if that be so then every animal is a living Soul amen and the Breath of God brings a new birth you hold that amen so CA they breathe hallelujah amen a human soul or human soul and all together that Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice he would have been sufficient so brother the argument don't stand Hallelujah you must be born again Hallelujah but what good did the breath that breathe of ET that breath of eternal life amen then he become a living Soul a soul that can't die amen now watch now we're going to get into honey plump to our elbow he said notice breath he said breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostril and he become a living Soul cuz God's breath not what nature done but what God did breathe the breath of life amen into this nutal and he become a living Soul amen hallelujah now we we're looking at that portion we want to move into another Direction now now a question is when God said let us make man in our image in Genesis 1:26 who was he talking to amen amen who was he talking to now let us look at Genesis 1:26 again and God said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the hair and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth Hallelujah God is one and as many titles or attribute is that right to express himself hallelujah amen at any point in time God Express himself by his attribute amen so it's either his title his office his attribute whatever we're want to call it but his father his son and he is the Holy Ghost are you with me and has always been the same person all the time there is one God hallelujah and none else so in Ephesians 4 and verse 6 he said one God and Father of all amen who is above all father and through all the son and in you all the holy spirit amen amen hallelujah Glory it literally it it it really depends on your viewpoint on how you see the scripture now in Isaiah 45 and verse 22 the Bible says look unto me and be saved amen all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else look unto me and be saved amen he said for I am God therefore it's projecting God as your savior Hallelujah and he said and if I am your savior there's none else hallelujah amen so in the message Look Away to Jesus paragraph 216 he said so many of you that claim to have the Holy Ghost look and see the second person of a trinity claiming to have the Holy Ghost but you're looking and you're said I see the second person of the Trinity amen when it's not even mentioned in the bible there is no such a thing the word Trinity is not even in the Bible but yet when you look at Jesus you regard him as the the the third person or the second person of a trinity and that's the reason you don't get anywhere Amen in paragraph 217 he said you know what he said I am God and there is none other beside me sir in other words when I stand there's none beside me there there there there is one God Amen but we've got to look now at his expression amen we got to get it there amen hallelujah amen he said no so it depends on what you're looking at if you want to put some little mcot boy and whole man with beard and so forth if that's the way you look at Jesus as being some different person from God you are looking wrong you don't see it and if you will focus your mind to God's word there's only one way we can get it not by theology to God's word the tree will be one see but your ecclesiastical glasses get out of focus when you try to make him three and not one the question is who was he talking to I want you to bear that in mind amen Look Away to Jesus paragraph 222 but it depends on what you are looking at what do you see when you do look remember you can only see him as you look at him through the word where is he through the word amen hallelujah you can't look at him through a textbook you can't look at him through a Creed Hallelujah you will how you will see two or three gods or everything else in them Creed but look at him through the word and you'll see that he is Emmanuel God made flesh Among Us he said I am God and beside me there is none other he is God one God Amen Hallelujah so Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth one God Amen hey I tell you this thank God he sent us an elaser in this hour right amen have you ever think where you would be if God never set us a voice in this hour we would be there in the Rue choir singing God in three persons Blessed Trinity that's where we would have been but God set us a voice we would be back there in Pentecost preaching a god like your finger amen hallelujah Glory but let us look now the word God was translated from the Hebrew word Elohim meaning self-existing one you all know that hallelujah amen all dwelling all by himself that was what he was way before the creation of all things even man in the adopted me adoption 605 15E paragraph 99 he said let me before we go any further go back to Genesis 1:26 when God made man before he made man he call himself l l l eloh h amen hello him the word means in Hebrew the self-existing one all by himself nothing exists before him that's right it was all the existence there were there ever was self-existing one L Ella hello him means all sufficient all powerful mighty self-existing one Hallelujah so we say then before God was God hallelujah there's no textbooks that ever say that amen no Theologian have expressed that but a prophet says before God was God amen hallelujah when he was Elohim back before the beginning that was before the beginning

theophany 2 Corinthians 51 if we Hur the house in this Tabernacle be dissolved we've got an Assembly of God high up in the heavens that's not made with hands but in this we're groaning because we don't know but our house in heaven knows this this is terrestial but he is Celestial amen is that another you no it's the same you but he puts you here to be tested and tried and we many times talk about job he said have you considered my servant job but God said the same about you and you're looking at the present display God's looking at himself because his attributes went out and every attribute that go out will come back to God that God will be all in all this trial that you're going through is nothing for the glory that God will reveal in you Hallelujah my M I like that yes sir we got to know who he is if we're going to know who we are amen hallelujah knowing that that he know that this great attribute in him would project something Yonder that could be saved could be saved could be saved you know why you can be saved hello because you're a part of God that's it there's parts of the creation that cannot be saved but you can be saved you can be saved not because you were created Created no there's things that were created by God that will go in unated but you can be saved because you are the thought of God God and the thoughts of God are Eternal and so you are Eternal in God that's right no devil can stop you right amen hallelujah and you got to know who you are when you approach the enemy you got to know the authority that's in your mouth amen this week we were laying hands on people and pray for them but we don't even have to lay hands if we know who we are I was down in Liberia and I was through preaching and the young people was at the altar and you know brother Caleb you can he touch me on the shoulder he said brother K there's a woman here that's possessed with a devil you want to pray for her I said yes amen cuz the anointing is already there he's there and when I turned around they were holding her from coming towards me because that demon want to reach out but I didn't touch her I I said in the name of Jesus Christ and come out of her and she lose all her strength and they didn't have to hold her no more she swiveled down on the ground amen and even when church was over she was still snoring on the floor she needed rest she had struggled with that power of that demon inside of her she was like a Raging Bull but when God take that from her her body needed rest and she was sleeping on the ground you got to know who he is that you know who you are amen hallelujah then when he did that by for knowledge he looked down and saw everyone that would accept it you know why you accept it it's not because you're bright no it's not because you're good yeah you even know that among your siblings yes if if you be fair there were some that should have received this and you should have been damned to hell but by the grace of God somebody said I received God when I was a child and I've never left but there's another one that said I run away the devil had a f day with my life it's not because I wanted to come back but because God rich in Mercy but God but God but God rich in Mercy for his great love wear L us when we were dead in Tres and sin he projected that love I don't care what Satan does I see a part of myself that's why he sought me and he bought me in his redeeming blood amen hallelujah and then by doing so he said to say that the only way I can do it was will come down myself and make flesh and take the sin of man upon Him brother Wade everything that you committed when you went away he took that upon himself hallelujah amen amen he died for me that I might be the one that's worshiped because he's God the object of worship amen I see reason to love him right here hallelujah amen it's not the preacher will preach to you no no no it's not your grandmother prayed all all night over your soul no it's God it is God it is God hallelujah amen glory so now he's no longer hello him self-existing no no no no no no he's no longer at him to Nester uhuh his children that went out of him come back to him amen you understand that amen what children brother keep me Hallelujah is now Jehovah because he exists with his family Hallelujah am his manifested attributes Hallelujah the manifestation of the Son of God amen hallelujah amen so now let us look at him quickly so firstly amen if Hallelujah form was the first form was light called the pillar of fire right and that Pillar of Fire amen hallelujah the logos the word the sh kind of Glory that's his first birth God giving birth to himself amen now if if I was to draw this cuz sometimes when you look at my notes only me can understand it because it's not in words it's in symbol right and and I usually Express things as a pyramid so you see when we speak of the Eternal god brother how do you draw that on a board right an eternal God that fill all time space and Eternity I I cannot project it I cannot draw it I cannot write that on a piece of paper amen the Eternal God right amen but in order for my mind to conceive it he become the logos he gave birth to himself brother Bram said a tangible form a light a pillar of fire amen that I can look at that is why this pill of fire when we saw that we should never put William Brandon's picture there we put the half man head of Christ he said the best of my knowledge that's what I saw it is him amen hallelujah amen glory to God yes sir so there a pillar of fire the logos you must not make any mistake about that the Eternal God cannot be fathomed with a pen and paper no the eternal spirit amen so when he said let us make man in our image it has not yet appeared but we shall be but this we know oh hallelujah amen glory to God Amen I'm trying to reach you now hallelujah amen so the logos was the invisible Holy Spirit the eternal spirit made visible image and tangible that was the form he came also on the day of Pentecost amen amen the same God that speak the world into existence and like to say that same God came on the day of Pentecost and he has not left because that same God meet you that day oh hallelujah amen glory when you said I have the new birth the same one meet with you oh may I say am and when he met you your life could never be the same again amen years ago his brother Dale taught us he said fate the bottom of the pyramid you're born again experience and then you had virtue and knowledge and tell but you want me to tell you something everything that you need was in that seed nothing excluded was in that seed that came and he begins to build that experience amen and you said ah he's building what a glory he's building he's building hey can I say storms of your maturing what he was doing he was Destroy what you are so when I say from Faith to Virtue he was destroying what I am you can take the oroscope and if they say you Bor cor under a certain sign people can look at you know you and said Ah that's exactly what we is that's exactly the way he is that's exactly the way you are and the they reading of this characteristic that was the old nature when the new birth begin to bring you into that image oh Hallelujah can I say like this it's your six se that I'm a Gideon that destroy who you are there is a butterfly in every caterpillar but in order for that butterfly to come out of that caterpillar that caterpillar is going to be destroyed it's got to have am a Gideon so he can have a metamorphosis amen and you've got to have an armagideon destroying who you are because when he transform you nothing nothing of who you were is still there Hallelujah don't let them fool you nothing of what you were but now you're coming into the image of who he is amen you can take your Bible and hold it like the prophet or hold it like your favorite preacher that's stupidity because that's not the image that God if that's the image that God is bringing you to oh Hallelujah brother brandham that when he look and he think of himself and he saw that man in that overall he said that's who I should have been that's what I wanted that's what in my Gene but that's not what God wants God wants a picture of himself there's going to be a day when you look in the mirror it's not the picture of your daddy or your mama no not the jeans of your family Lage but the picture of God amen hallelujah amen yes sir Hallelujah so the marked in the beginning time frame an eternal time a creation time yes amen that's what he's doing the lust the light was not all of the eternal spirit but it represent the eternal spirit it was an emissary y right of an eternal spirit a a a and discharging a displaying Hallelujah a channel an outlet am is that right of God thoughts amen hallelujah the logos was the begotten son amen amen yes hallelujah amen that the Bible said from the bosom meaning the belly the heart of the father declaring the invisible eternal spirit John 1:18 amen amen so John 1:18 it says no man had seen God at any time get that clear in your head if I draw it on paper what would I put would I put the pill the picture of a square yeah it has boundaries do I draw a line amen it's got boundaries with the Eternal God cannot be represent it can't be represent come on except he reflected himself the logos that I see the pillar of fire he come in a form that my mind can channel can understand a concept of who he is listen until that day of your change you never never can reflect that eternal spirit amen hallelujah amen so John 1:18 no man had seen God at any time the only begotten son is the logos which is in the bosom the belly the heart of the father Hallelujah Elohim the eternal spirit e the logos as declared God amen amen hallelujah oh we could take scripture after the scripture now amen hallelujah so the next scripture now Hallelujah s John 1 1-5 in the beginning was the word that's the logos and the Word was with God yes sir and the Word was God amen amen now that's my mind picture of God Amen the same was in the beginning with God and he said all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life is the light of man and the light Shone in darkness and the Darkness comprehended not when the Bible says comprehended not it did not mean it did not understand it it dispel it to nothingness right so light replace the darkness in other words the darkness and the light could not be together so when the light project there was no Darkness that's what it means it says it comprehend it not amen hallelujah amen it did not show that you and I are the Train the Angels cherubim creatures the seraphim came first Hallelujah in expression but the word the logos the pillar of fire the sh kind of Glory Hallelujah not the teony no not the theophany the logos amen let let me say this quickly to you you see the logos is like a veil yeah and in that Veil The teapon is there Amen in the eternal spirit God the logos is there but until he project him the logos Veil can't come out now so let me say this now so when he project himself as a logos if the logos should speak of him he says my father yeah right and when from that Veil the logos the the theophany steps out the theophany say of that Veil that I come from my father and when that logos that theophan remember now the theophany neither eat nor sleep but when he met Abraham he put on 16 elements and he heat with Abraham and he refers back to the he said my father and so Jesus when he came he said my father I come from my my father cuz it's constantly giving birth to himself hallelujah amen amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah the word the logos was made Lord Jesus Christ amen hading even before he was manifested in the flesh yes terrestial visible was the agency of creation so the word is a e person the person the name Jesus was the father's name amen Lord Jesus Christen and he receive me not so Jesus was say let me let's TT in John 5:43 I am come in my father's name is that what he said said right I come in my father's name amen Lord Jesus Christ amen and he received me not he said if another shall come in his own name him he shall receive you know why they could not receive him in his father's name cuz they didn't know his father and neither do they know [Music] him so theology we realize now cannot recognize God and if theology does not recognize him the church and all its denomination is lost right cuz they preach a concept of God that can never materialize in a body amen hallelujah amen so the Apostle Paul puts it in in Colossians 1:15 yeah amen he said who is the image yes so I'm reflecting now St John 5:43 amen I am come in my father's name and so Paul now in Colossians 1:15 said who is the image of the invisible God Amen Hallelujah the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are iner visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or Dominion or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him yes sir and for him Hallelujah and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church amen hallelujah who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence preeminence now let me say this to you that in all things he might have preeminence now in Christ The Mystery of God reveal I personally believe when brother Brandon preached Christ The Mystery of God revealed he was preaching the seventh seal amen amen the coming of the Lord that he might reveal himself completely in Jesus Christ what of you to do with that right amen there's nothing you can do about that God reveal himself completely in Jesus Christ but number two that he might have preeminence he might be the first person he might have the leading among the body of believer amen listen church if God don't have the leading in your life you are not of God he's got to mean more to you than the breath you breathe then your wife your husband your children he's got to be first person your reason for living amen therefore it's not your desire it's not your thought it's not who you think that you are or aspire to be if God don't have preeminence in your life there will never be a restoration back to the Garden of Eden all Redemption would have been lost can you do that by yourself I tell you before the only way it can be done is by the word of God Supreme deity has got to stand up in your life and live in your life everything that you do therefore you know the church the church are not to be where we come to yeah when we have nothing else to do you see we don't come if it's too hot yeah we don't come if it's too cold hey we don't come if there's a ball game going on we don't come if somebody is sick there is so many things we we put before the perfecting of our soul am amen but Brethren if you look back when Israel was in the wilderness and the Tabernacle of Moses was set up every tribe their Direction was set towards the Tabernacle that's where the shakina glory comes down it was a central theme of their existence no matter what tribe they belong to no matter what they do the Tabernacle was a central theme of their existence cuz that's where the Ark of the Covenant and The Mercy Seat was Brethren they were without the Holy Ghost that's right they call it the Tabernacle of weight because they had to wait on the day of atonement to see if God one more year would have accepted the blood of an innocent substitute for our lives but today today the Holy Ghost oh the Holy Ghost bring you back to the image of Jesus Christ Brethren if we're going to leave out of here if we're going to leave out of here Christ must have preeminence preeminence first person in our lives amen it must not be just something that we do and we join a lodge We join a church this is more than church amen this is God revealing himself amen into his creation and God took the cream we say the cream but God took himself and place it in the creation we walk among Common People amen but Christ in you Christ in you is a hope of glory and the only God this world is ever see will ever see is a God that dwells in you and so when God step or when that logos comes out of God God gave birth to himself God begot God Amen so sometimes you you even talk to yourself and some of you do it more than some really and you know that's good for your mental capacity really cuz you know the the psychologist says you can always talk to yourself but when you when you begin to answer yourself then then you're you you're you're totally gone so I could be by myself said self how you feel today if self ever answer me I got to go to the Asylum amen but God amen but God when he saw Hallelujah himself coming into tangible being am Hallelujah he was so perfect in his expression and projection that God says let us make man yeah amen exactly right amen hallelujah yes sir he couldn't talk to me I was a thought but he speak yes through the logos right cuz through him created all things amen and the devil knowing who you are that you come from God and you're going back to God amen amen he bring you through everything of this world can give to you it put you in broken homes your marriage is broken your children is going astray everything it caus a catastrophe in your life he puts everything there you you lose focus and Direction and and the desires of the this world become so cloudy your mind that you're losing where you're coming from but

that he could do to you but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherein he Lov us even when we were dead in sin has Quicken us together with Christ by by grace are you saved hallelujah it's the grace of God and and I like what he says there in Romans he said for you're predestined unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ am no matter what the devil do you're going to find your position I'm going to find my position and I'll tell you boo devil cuz I'm going to walk in it and there's coming a day when when even God look at me the only thing he's going to see is [Music]
