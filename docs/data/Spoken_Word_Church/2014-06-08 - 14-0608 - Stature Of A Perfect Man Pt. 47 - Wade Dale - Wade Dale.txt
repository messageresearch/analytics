TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all and we're talking about godliness and we've been talking on godliness for a couple of times and we are going to uh continue the thought because there's really not there's really not a quote that we can quote you and say well this is this is how to be Godly there's not a scripture except the whole Bible that tells you how to have godliness so to be like God is going to be that we we are now we are now to have a god Consciousness everybody getting that we have to have a god Consciousness when we did the things of the world we didn't have a god Consciousness now God might have been dwelling with us but we overrode that and did our own Consciousness we drank we smoked we run around we did all the things of the world because we had no God Consciousness now God maybe was dealing and he was guiding you through life especially you know if you're born again now you know for one thing that God was looking for you looking after you when you were born as a baby all right um actually preserved you before the foundation of the world you just didn't know it's what we're talking about last night the Bible study the condescending of God is Not So that God can understand himself better it's so that we can understand God he knows who he is and he also knows who we are and like I was saying you say well sometimes this is hard or that's hard or listen if there was a better way to understand God we would be in that way that's right we we there would be an understanding that we would you know if God said well the easiest way is for is for all of us to like the color blue well then we would allow all like the color blue I'm just making for an example but he didn't he made it to where we can understand God as he condescends toward man we're able to ascend toward him and you can't understand a supernatural god with natural thought it's not natural Temperance it's not natural knowledge it's not natural patience some people have part of these virtues and don't have the new birth they're just as sinful as sinner can be all right so you can't just say well that person's patient boy they must be a Christian no they ain't got one thing to do with it that's right we got to become a Christian first then when we see patience take over like we was talking about last night and like I said Wednesday night and I'm sorry if it hurts you feeling feelings but how you going to overcome sitting at home right you cannot overcome sitting at home and the Bible says to the Overcomer that's right will I give these things you got to have something to overcome if this was just so easy and we can come to church when we wanted to and we can study when we want to and we can do what then you know then God is a grand dead just lets us get by with everything but he's not he's a father he said look this is the formula you got to go by and if you don't like you must not be one of mine that's right backl to lost one of the two we got to come down to where you see that it's honing people down here you see Faith it's big wi it's it's something that you have to establish everything you have on faith right everything you have has to be established on faith that's right now virtu is a little more narrow knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness sister Johnny and I were talking briefly about brotherly kindness that's going to be the worst one for us right right for us it's going to be the worst one cuz that means you got to love that guy that done something to you and you got to love him as much as you love yourself that's going to be tough and you got to really mean it not just say oh well I you know I forgive them or or you know you always hear this one and it's okay to say well you were forgiven before you asked but still you got to ask ask you understand what I'm saying you said I asked a man yesterday we were buying some or we were swapping some be equipment stuff and he gave me a hive and and I told him I apologize for something you know for that if nothing if it wasn't right what we swapped out he said I'll use forgiven before you got here and that's okay but you can't just use as a cough out and then saying yourself say well I'm going to be forgiven anyway so why no no you got to ask forgiveness it's a conf of the mouth it's like sister John and I were talking really God don't care what you put in think about that God don't care what you put in that's right he never has said that he said what proceedeth out right of the mouth that's right right in the scripture what proceedeth out he said it's not what it goes out in the draw and all that he said what's proceeding from your mouth of course it's going to proceed from what's in what you feed it but God God wants us to display it not just what would it be if we just had it all and then went and went into a cave and and lived a Hermit life that's not what God wants he wants us to display that's what this statue of a perfect man is it's God on display to the people the only God they're ever going to see is when we live that statue of a perfect man so really it's not it's not because you can take in what about the guy that can quote the whole Bible right he may not even be born again if he's not born again he sure ain't got another virtues so it's not what you take in you see what I'm saying I mean you some of you look a little puzzled but you can memorize the message right you can memorize every quote but unless it comes out right in your own Revelation and it can't be contrary to what goes in either that's right got to be the same but like I said last night it does it have to be every single a quote B like that quote right there do we have to read it every no we read quotes and then we expound on it that's right and it's not that we fill in the blanks I've heard people say fill in the blanks no you don't fill in the blanks brother that leav any blanks we read between the lines we know what he was saying and we're expounding on that the word is all important the word created all of this and and like you said we take in the holy spirit will dig that and throw it out and the word that comes out the word we speak is going to change our body that's right your your your body change will not come from one creature speaking and your body change that's not that way anymore brother Brown said it's an individual affair with God is what comes from the inside now what you got on the inside is going to change you one way or the other but you chain started at a new birth cuz it was an inward work we all maybe look the same but we begin as we were talking about last night um and maybe you don't understand this so let me explain it to you there's casting out of devils and then there's that devil that resides in your soul that nature that you're giving at Birth to me that's too different it's not too different devils but it's two different manifestations that's true because you can you can somebody can have a a ling Spirit on them or let's say that one that brother Bram did about the woman that she was in the insane asylum and and they went and went to all the places and she couldn't find rest and brother Brandon by the discernment of the Holy Spirit brought something out in her life that she had done 20 years ago and that was so deep down inside of her well see that was a devil on her right it was a demon well see he cast that thing off of of her and then she went on to confess and live a normal life Christian she he said Christian okay so that was a demon that could be cast out just like that but now in this walk of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost I was thinking about last night when we were talking about that it says the unclean Spirit goes out of a man it didn't say the unclean spirit is cast out of the man now we know it's being cast out by the word but it can be doing it can be doing in stages gradually right everybody understand that because your walk in sanctification is is I got either if I'm smoking then I I can either do like God did me and he just said that's it you don't have to worry about it no more and I the next day I didn't want anymore the tobacco but some people can kind of go through sanctification and that unclean Spirit can go out in stages that's right anybody understand what I'm saying so so what I'm saying the new birth is different than being possessed by a demon you can be possessed by a demon and have a demon of whatever you want to call it that's and that can be cast out right by prayer in the name of Jesus Christ that can be cast out yes on that sister she was a Sunday school teacher that's correct and brother had prayed for her mhm and that he that's right until he had a discernment on her cuz he she held it inside of her exactly so even brother praying for you and you don't confess right that's right so that put what I'm saying you understand what I'm saying though casting out of devil is something that could be instantaneous you can have that thing cast off of you and you know in an instant but now in the Walk of a Christian Life it could take a year it could take 6 months it that's why I said don't worry about it but you I'd worry about it if it was 5 years but I don't know where your mark is but you know my Mark I guess I want it instantaneous I want it I wanton instantly godone but God has to work on that and then like somebody I think was Susan or somebody said you look back and go well I don't do that no more sister John said some of the things that used to bother me he said she said wasn't it just like it bothered me and then it was gone it was like you go through a process and then one day God will have somebody cut you off on the road or something and that old thing won't rise up anymore and you go it's gone we see it just it went out of the person it it left because of the word that you took in the more word words you pack in he's got to leave because that devil I don't care what you want to call him he hates a word oh yeah he hates the truth of the word he hates the truth of the word he doesn't mind the word cuz it's what you take in but when you try to when you put it out and God comes into you it's like I was saying Wednesday night and I love those quotes on on my guide is you do these things you do these things and then it's the God's responsibility to take you the rest of the way that's right amen it's like me and Donnie we had to get to Texas to meet the guide and then the GU did his job right you know so we had something that we had to do we had to walk through justification sanctification into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then that guide began to lead us and guide us into all truth sure he was leading us and guiding us into all truth when we said God forgive my soul but but you weren't fully in the body you weren't fully up to where you can grow up in a stature not a statue that's right it's a stature it's height development growth development but that's what we're trying to get over Wednesday night is we preach in this church a journey that's right most people just preach that it's just beli in the prophet's message and I've heard them out of their own mouth their own mouth well it's believ in the message of the hour that's right well you know the devil believes part of it at least some he had to see the manifestation of it and I hope he sees the manifestation of it now it's what makes him mad okay so so he's he's right here that's right it's the two spirits in the framework of the church message church right not out there in here and what's going to discern that guide that guide's going to discern which way we go but now we can override that remember like I said we can greet the Holy Spirit we cannot go up the statute of perfect man as far as we we allow that to work that's right Hey listen when God said you are Gods Heen it that's right and brother rown said you're a little God it doesn't matter if you're he said you're a born a Son of God whether you're whether you're not born again whether you born again or not cuz you come from and had the characteristics of God that's right what that you do but over time that nature that you're born under it erodes and it covers and like brother Brown said it blackens that Soul it blackens all that out and you're a devil I mean you're letting the devil take over then the Holy Ghost comes in with fire burns that burns that old nature out and puts his nature in that's right now that's at a new birth but now sanctification and all that they go out the little things that we do go out at at different times that's right and remember even when you're born again you're still going to have trouble that's right but like I said before if if if you're if if you go to church less now than you did when you first got born again or thought that you got born again maybe you didn't get born again that's what the Bible says and much more as a day approaches and then we get you know you look around and you see people not here so you wonder what uh what's leading and guiding them I'm tell you something the devil's real amen and he's right here amen he ain't somewhere else that's right if he can defeat us he's got it whooped but all those promises that we read there in Psalms how God was going to restore right well he's going to restore he's going to restore a bride he promised he would so somebody's going to do it and we have to decide whether we're in thaten we're in that camp or not all right I ain't talking about a man's Camp either that's right let's read second Peter and U speak just a minute Simon Peter servant Apostle Jesus Christ to them that have obtained obtained they went out and got it kingdom of God is taken by force you got to remember that this thing's got to be taken by force right you know Bob did a wonderful job of that obtain like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertains unto life that's what we're talking about now and godliness there knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this in other words besides your new birth Ain that what he saying cuz that's how much a new birth from verse 1 through 4 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and brother kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be bar nor un fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ in other words that gives you that God Consciousness it gives you that cuz remember let me State this um I guess lightly there's only a few people have ever reached right there at brotherly kindness only a few people in this world from the day of Pentecostal now from the day of Pentecostal now there's only been a few I'm talking about a few people have attained to that brotherly kindness right there where it says cuz that's the faith of the fathers right right now the 120 in the upper room had it but the 3,000 downstairs didn't I don't know how many of them grew into it but it couldn't have been many because after that happened it started eroding back down the other way right right so it didn't go up it went back down amen the first three Ages were okay but after that after the dogmas and all from n and all that took over it started eroding the word of God and nobody even reached hardly you know look at Columbus age brother said all they had was a confession that they were Jesus Christ that they believed in Jesus Christ and they were saved and they were killed that's all they didn't have virtue knowledge temper patience God and brotherly kindness they just got in the body they just got in the body squeezed in and then they were killed so they didn't have that manifestation of all the word then you look at Martin Luther like I was telling um s over here Martin Luther had one little slot that's right that was the just shall live by faith and it wasn't that God didn't care that he didn't go up the statue of perfect man he started building again I will restore with that the just shall live by faith right there Foundation then Wesley come through and he didn't get the full word he got part word so he could part talk about virtue part talk about knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness okay right part of it but still he was a trinitarian still he baptized name Father Son and Holy Ghost so he wasn't he wasn't all the total of the positive right right all right so there's Wesley then the Pentecostals come along and they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother R said they cabbage down on that so they stayed down here if they had had some Holy Ghost knowledge they wouldn't cabbage down on it sure they had a little piece of it everybody gets a little bit of it at the new birth you get a little piece of all this cuz you know what you better act like that when even when you're born again try to act Godly anyway you know I mean you got God in you so you must have to have some kind of characteristic of God that's right right so don't just say well I'm born again now I need godliness well you're born again with a little bit of godliness but that's the fullness of godliness that's when you act then that's when you're like I said your whole and listen don't get me wrong it's not our whole being we still have to work we still have to live we still have problems at home children parents grandparents I mean you still got all that to deal with that's true but godliness is a god consciousness of I used to raise up and do that now I don't anymore I used to to me like I told you before godliness looks down through patience Temperance knowledge back down to your new birth that's right see godliness looks right down through here right and check to me it checked you up that's right cuz see this is going going to check you up on every bit of them that's right cuz remember you don't just get virtue and then put the book over here virtue you don't just put the book over there and say well I'm done that's right now you don't graduate right from from virtue virtue grade to knowledge grade you know you don't get a deploma you get your diploma right here when you get a body change that God robes you in that whatever they call that thing that you wear with the icky on your head you know your uh graduation Ro but that's up here that's not down here sure you birth into the body but God wants somebody to manifest him and he's been looking for it all down through time since he gave the new birth of that 120 in the upper room which were birthed right here they had all this look at Peter and Paul like I was saying Wednesday night look at Peter and Paul a little confrontation well you know what Peter could have had no brotherly kindness and he said well bless God Paul ain't not he my pastor yeah that's easy for people to say now I ain't my pastor I Ain got to listen to but Peter I'm sure Peter said Paul you're right I'm sorry forgive me probably asked his whole congregation said forgive me sure it's not written there but you know what they went on they were brothers they had brotherly kindness they didn't separate that's right that's why a prophet had come right to restore all the word yeah put all this back together none of them had the word that we thought no people think that brother B come to tell us have dress whatever whatever get and the Pentecost done that not all that stff that's right so brother Bram come to restore the word that's the only reason God s why other reason did he send it the poor thing went through all kind of situations and whatever yep he didn't just send him just to be s and then he sent to restore all that word and it was God restoring the word but he was showing it through a man that could live it that's right a man that could live it and He restored it and there it was so we can look at our example and and and watch this there wasn't many people that made it to he very small amount right mhm why is that not supported by iPad put on here this is hard but there's not many people that made it here now look there's only a couple people made it to he yes Jesus Christ and brother Brown amen that we that we know that did in the past right now we got people now that that is coming to this cuz that's required that's a requirement for The Headstone to be put over and kept the people off so we know that that's very very narrow and there's only small amount of people but you know what you can say Well it can't be me well then you then it won't that's right then it won't be you if you say well I can't do it then then you won't that's right what's Brother D going to start preaching on positive attitude and this ain't a this ain't a Feelgood I hope he gets into this is not uh um what is that Christian Science where you know good thoughts mean good things and bad thoughts mean bad things no it's it's not one them but brother BR said a positive mental attitude toward the word of God will bring that to pass a positive mental attitude toward the word now if we don't live the word does he have to do that no he doesn't but if we live the word the best we can he will come to those promises and he will give them to us let me read this in first Timothy that Divine love there the two that had full right which was not just hair and dress and honestly all that should went out right down here that's right before Faith Comes the brother said you can't get a holy ghost filled woman put on a pair of pants or cut her hair then that's down here that ain't even we ain't even talking about that up here right we past that that's why I said Wednesday night we've been wasting time on do's and don't get on to this right here and all them do CU see sanctification is right down here that's right right right sanctification is down here before you even get that when you get that right there that's the faith of God that's not your faith that's right that's the faith of almighty God Amen and you won't do those things so what are we into now everybody's preaching well we got to be up here up here up here here that's okay but how you get there first you got to start down here cuz you can't preach you don't you don't need to preach hair and Dr dress anywhere in here you're wasting time that's right and I know there's people come to in it you got to preach it to but still there's a time when you got to say okay if you're still cutting your hair you're lost come to the altar get born again right don't sit in the church and say amen and Hallelujah and all that just forget it but right here is taking that man Christ Jesus and making him live in you without controversy great is the mystery of godliness so it's a mystery why is it a mystery cuz you're living it in the world don't know it right that's true God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up in the glory then 1 Timothy 4:6 says if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine where un to thou Hast attained but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness which is of god Consciousness for bodly exercise profited little but godliness is profitable unto all things all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come so in other words he's not just going to see that's the problem with a lot of people even in the message well when we get over there or when brother brandom comes or when the Holy Ghost finally come we're going to get to be living right right here the Bible says God is profitable to All Things having promise of the life that now is and that of which is to come so it's the promise of now that's right and that which is to come see to me it's just a cop out for people to say Well when brother Brown comes back to me that's lazy people that's right that's lazy people that says brother R's going to come back and he's going to tell me all these things and he's going to give me he ain't Jesus Christ Jesus Christ he said was here so brother Brown must have took him with him and we don't got nothing no I don't believe that that's right I believe the only way brother R's going to get out of the Grave is because we believe all what he preaches and get a revelation now listen to what Timothy or what Paul summed this up in Timothy 1 Timothy 4:9 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation he sums it up I mean Paul's pretty you know you think I'm blunt but you ought to read Paul sometimes this is a faithful saying and worthy of all that acceptation so whatever he said above that which was what I just told you you need to accept it and it's faithful because it happens now and it happens then all right same way with here but now look 2 Timothy 3:5 brings it over and saying having a form of godliness but denying the power thou of from such turn away so there's people that's going to be so close to Godliness but deny the power thereof like brother Dale was talking about the you know people that are that's going to have great manifestations uh you hear that Jeff Jenkins and and actually they took it off you see they took number one off number one he was like boy this brother over in South America South Africa he eclipses brother brandham and signs and wonders well that's the biggest lie that ever was told on the face of this Earth there's nobody a clip brother Bram in signs and wonders except Jesus Christ and brother brand said he had more Jesus Christ had that's right so forget that baloney so whoever the man is over there if he ain't if he ain't born again it's just signs of Wonders I'm sorry but they took that first video off you know that didn't I still got it cuz Joe sent me that link so I keep I keep it on my link but you see a man that's untaught and unskillful that what first thing they do they get defensive right start fighting things and that's what he's doing that's what that man's doing he's fighting stuff he's fighting things he's heard all the junk in the message and and you know thank God we still preach justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and we preach a furtherment of the Holy Ghost that after you get it we preach that the God's going to take you on through amen and we got to go up the statute of a perfect man it's not just something it's brother brand wasted you know a sermon on tape no it's a requirement something where we you know what it's something that no other age has been able to do except this age right that's true Jesus did it in his time cuz he was almighty God he was The Headstone amen so he was the first fruit see everybody says brother R was the first fruit no Jesus was the first fruit he was the first one to come brother brandom was the next one to come and we have to follow his message that's right right which is the message of The Headstone amen it's not a message of William Bram over here and Jesus Christ over here that's right it's Jesus Christ head of all things that's right and then brother brandom's here he got drawn up into it right opening of the seals and all those things and bringing the message so that we could come up cuz remember the sheath wave was the first one to come to maturity the first head that come out in that whole field the priest walked through that whole field every day and the first sheath that popped open he would gather a bunch of it and he would wave it over the field well that field wasn't mature yet it was just those ones that he had in his hand right so you got Jesus Christ brother BR being an an example for us and yeah that was waved over us cuz we were all little bitty plants that were trying to come to maturity so there's a way if you say well a man with a seventh grade education if he can attain to it then so can we cuz seventh grade education doesn't matter to me whether he was educated with a PhD or if he had third grade education Peter done pretty good and couldn't even write his name what I see with the statute of prop man is the faith is our foundation God's Building us building a mansion those are all levels of the Mansion right well those actually that's your building right that's what you're going to live in in the future home right there that's your building it's the stature of a perfect man that's the building that you're going to live on so I mean that's just the way it's going to be that you're building your future home right now Jesus said I go away to prepare place but I'll come unto you what do you do he brought the building on the day of Pentecost he started with the faith on bottom of the pyramid bir 120 through that statute were perfect man then he continued on with you and I so all right let's go I can see why the perfect word had to go down early in the church sure had be sure see they didn't have all the wording Harvest Right the seals weren't open
