[2:32] uh I saw this morning early this morning
[2:35] when the FAA had their glitch with their
[2:37] computer system everything shut down and
[2:40] no flights going anywhere and uh
[2:43] he said they were going to talk to the
[2:44] airline to see about where they were
[2:46] going and
[2:47] he said well we missed our flight
[2:49] and I got to thinking about it I was
[2:51] like well no
[2:52] you'll be on the right flight
[2:54] that wasn't your flight
[2:56] you know that's the flight you want to
[2:57] get on but that's not your flight
[3:00] the Lord Works everything out he's in
[3:01] control of everything so
[3:04] kind of what we're gonna look at tonight
[3:08] uh
[3:10] I know somebody somebody posted one of
[3:13] the scriptures that we're going to look
[3:15] at tonight and uh
[3:18] you know God has all things in control
[3:20] and you know what he ain't worried about
[3:23] nothing he ain't surprised by nothing

[3:34] Lord will bless brother Louise and
[3:36] brother Bob and them on the trip
[3:38] you know
[3:40] things hit snags but you know that just
[3:42] means there's going to be a greater
[3:43] blessing down the road so
[3:46] I've never I've never seen the devil try
[3:47] to stop something that you know the one
[3:50] God didn't bless if you try to try to do
[3:52] something for work a god Devil's always
[3:54] going to be there to stop it or he's
[3:55] going to try to stop it but
[3:58] that's all right Lord knows what he's
[4:00] doing
[4:01] amen well if you have your Bibles

[7:03] upon them bless the services
[7:05] Lord bless your bride around the world
[7:07] commit all things to you in the name of
[7:09] Jesus Christ amen
[7:12] amen Romans chapter 3 beginning of verse
[7:14] 9. it says now we know
[7:17] that what things so ever the law will
[7:18] saith it's saith to them that are under
[7:20] the law that every mouth may be stopped
[7:23] and all the world may become guilty
[7:25] before God therefore by the Deeds of the
[7:27] law there shall no flesh be justified in
[7:30] his sight for by the law is the
[7:32] knowledge of sin but now the
[7:34] righteousness of God
[7:37] but the righteous god without the law is
[7:39] manifested being witnessed by the law
[7:41] and the prophets even the righteousness
[7:43] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[7:46] upon all unto all and upon all them that
[7:49] believe for there is no difference for
[7:52] all have sinned and come short of the
[7:53] glory of God being justified freely by
[7:56] his grace through the Redemption
[7:58] that is in Christ Jesus
[8:02] who God set forth to be a propitiation
[8:05] through faith in his blood to declare
[8:07] his righteousness for the remission of
[8:09] sins that are passed through the
[8:11] forbearance of God to declare I say at
[8:14] this time his righteousness that he
[8:15] might be just in the justifier of him
[8:18] which believeth in Jesus
[8:22] and then chapter First Corinthians
[8:25] chapter 10
[8:27] . it's on the screen
[8:29] he says moreover Brethren I would not
[8:31] have ye
[8:34] that ye should be ignorant how that all
[8:37] our fathers were under the cloud and all
[8:39] passed through the sea and were all
[8:41] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[8:43] the sea and did all eat the same
[8:46] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[8:48] same spiritual drink and they drink of
[8:51] that spiritual rock that followed them
[8:54] and that rock was Christ but with many
[8:57] of them God was not well pleased for
[8:59] they were overthrown
[9:01] in the wilderness amen God bless you
[9:03] tonight you have your seats
[9:06] and I I titled this to know and not be
[9:09] ignorant of and
[9:11] uh
[9:13] I took these two passages scripture
[9:16] because
[9:19] Romans 3
[9:22] he says
[9:24] and we know
[9:27] we know that whatso
[9:29] that what things so ever the law saith
[9:31] it is to them that under law that every
[9:34] mouth may be stopped in all the world
[9:36] may be guilty before God
[9:40] and then here it says I would not have
[9:43] you ignorant
[9:45] and so I was I've kind of looked at this
[9:48] a little bit at different times and just
[9:49] I I you know it's interesting when you
[9:52] read the scripture and when you start to
[9:53] get into the scripture and how different
[9:57] writers and mainly this is the Apostle
[9:59] Paul but you get into some of the things
[10:01] that Apostle John says and Peter says it
[10:04] sometimes but uh the way they they word
[10:07] the way it's worded it's always it
[10:09] always stands out to me a little bit and
[10:12] so uh I just want to kind of look at at
[10:14] some of this tonight but um
[10:18] when it when it talks about
[10:20] here in the in the scripture and it
[10:23] gives a lot of places where
[10:26] Paul says we know
[10:28] and you know sometimes when you look at
[10:32] you think really we know
[10:34] and it's interesting when you start to
[10:36] read some of the scriptures that Paul
[10:37] says that we know
[10:39] and then when you look at some of the
[10:40] scriptures that uh
[10:42] when he says we shouldn't be ignorant of
[10:45] these things and when you begin to look
[10:47] at at some of these they're they're
[10:48] quite interesting and uh most of the
[10:51] time
[10:52] people kind of they don't quote all of
[10:55] this scripture but they only quote part
[10:56] of this scripture and it's Romans 8 28
[10:59] and and Paul says
[11:02] he says and we know
[11:04] that all things work together for good
[11:06] most people just say all things work
[11:07] together for the good
[11:09] well Paul says we know this
[11:12] who are they called according to his
[11:13] purpose
[11:15] because we know this why because the
[11:17] spirit that's inside of us is speaking
[11:20] to us and uh makes an assurance to us so
[11:23] that's why he says this is this is
[11:24] Assurance to us that it the spirit is
[11:27] making Assurance to us reveals to this
[11:30] that it all works out
[11:32] because that's that's the way that's the
[11:34] way the the law of God works
[11:37] he said we all it all works out to the
[11:39] good
[11:41] but first Thessalonians and most of the
[11:44] time if you ask people said if you ask
[11:47] them these are the two scriptures if you
[11:49] said
[11:49] um where the Bible says we know
[11:52] most people quote Romans 8 28 because
[11:55] that's where it says we know most people
[11:56] think of that and if you ask somebody
[11:58] where would where does it say we're not
[11:59] supposed to be ignorant of anything and
[12:02] most of the time most people will quote
[12:04] first Thessalonians 4 13. they said I
[12:07] would not have ignorant Brethren
[12:08] concerning them that are asleep that we
[12:09] you saw or not even as other which have
[12:11] no hope
[12:12] so when Paul looks at this and he's
[12:15] saying well these are things that we
[12:17] should know and these are things that we
[12:19] shouldn't be ignorant of
[12:21] and so when you when you begin to look
[12:23] at some of these uh different scriptures
[12:25] here where he talks about these things
[12:27] and you know we understand that and
[12:30] we'll look at some of these scriptures
[12:33] but you know I always always
[12:36] take comfort in this and always and I
[12:38] really like the way that it's written
[12:40] because you know it didn't say that we
[12:42] wouldn't have sorrow
[12:44] we wouldn't have stress we wouldn't have
[12:46] problems but you know what there's a you
[12:48] know The Human Condition the the human
[12:50] person your emotions you're going you're
[12:53] going to have sorrow you're going to
[12:55] have pain you're going to have grief but
[12:56] he said don't sorrow like those sorrow
[13:00] you know we're only separated from our
[13:02] loved ones for a short period of time
[13:04] sometimes it feels like sometimes it
[13:07] feels like an eternity
[13:09] but really when you look at it you know
[13:10] we're only separated them for just a
[13:12] short period of time
[13:14] and when when you realize you know
[13:15] they've gone on and you know those that
[13:18] have passed on they're in a they're in a
[13:20] better place than we are
[13:22] you know you think about you know all of
[13:25] all of how wonderful it is to be a past
[13:27] on and and to be in that place and you
[13:30] know they don't have to deal with all
[13:31] the things that we have to
[13:33] and we're we're left here but you know
[13:34] what it's it's us that we can have
[13:37] comfort because we know where they're at
[13:38] and you know what it won't be long they
[13:41] will be changing this we'll be leaving
[13:43] this uh past house it'll be it'll be a
[13:45] change because we're gonna they're gonna
[13:47] one of these days we're gonna meet them
[13:49] they're going to be coming back to meet
[13:51] us here
[13:52] and it's not going to be long and so you
[13:54] know we have comfort in that just
[13:56] because they're they're not they're gone
[13:58] from our site but you know what they're
[13:59] they're us with Jesus they're in the
[14:02] presence of God now but you know there's
[14:03] coming a time they're going to come back
[14:05] and we're going to have fellowship and
[14:07] so we know it's not that long so we
[14:08] don't have to worry because you know
[14:09] what there's people that you know when
[14:10] they gone they don't have anything
[14:12] beyond this realm they don't have
[14:14] anything beyond this like this is it
[14:16] when when they leave here there there's
[14:18] there is no there is no peace there's
[14:22] not this is the best life they're ever
[14:23] going to live
[14:24] when they when they leave here this is
[14:26] this is the best they've ever had
[14:29] but thank God there is a way made that
[14:32] that for us that have that have received
[14:35] the eternal life of when we receive what
[14:37] God has given us if we receive the grace
[14:39] of God you know what we haven't even
[14:41] begun to understand what God has for us
[14:44] we haven't even begun to scratch the
[14:46] surface of what God has for us or what
[14:49] lays ahead of us because you know he
[14:51] said that eyes can has not seen or ear
[14:53] heard neither has it entered into the
[14:54] heart of man
[14:56] so we don't know how good it's going to
[14:58] be
[14:59] but it's going to it's wonderful it's
[15:01] glorious
[15:04] and you know that's why that's what I'm
[15:06] looking forward to because I believe it
[15:07] won't be long
[15:12] now
[15:13] here
[15:15] I just want to uh I got a few scriptures
[15:18] here that I I put down and you know
[15:21] just show you a few of the scriptures
[15:23] and I just want to read these right
[15:25] quick but
[15:26] um
[15:27] where where Paul talks about and uh
[15:31] I think we got John also in here and but
[15:35] uh
[15:36] where he talks about using just the
[15:38] phrase We Know
[15:40] and uh Brett says Romans 7 14 says for
[15:45] we know that the law was spiritual but I
[15:47] am carnal sold under sin
[15:50] Romans 8 22 says for we know that the
[15:52] whole creation groaneth and travaaleth
[15:53] and pain together until now
[15:56] First Corinthians 8 1 says now it's
[15:58] touching things unto Idols we know that
[16:01] we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth
[16:03] up but charityth edify First Corinthians
[16:06] 8 4 says as concerning therefore the
[16:08] eating of those things which are offered
[16:10] in sacrifice unto Idols we know that an
[16:13] idol is nothing in the world and that
[16:15] there is nothing but other there's none
[16:19] other God but one
[16:21] and then First Corinthians 13 9 says for
[16:24] we know in part and we prophesy in part
[16:27] and second Corinthians 5 1 says for we
[16:30] know that if our Earthly house or this
[16:33] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[16:34] building of God and house not made with
[16:36] hands Eternal in the heavens
[16:40] and then First Corinthians I mean sorry
[16:42] first Timothy 8 1 says but we know that
[16:45] the law is good if a man used it
[16:47] lawfully
[16:49] and then the Apostle John in first John
[16:51] says 3 3 14 says we know that we have
[16:54] passed from Death unto life because we
[16:56] have loved the Brethren he that loveth
[16:58] not his brother abideth in death so just
[17:02] just a few scriptures I wanted to read
[17:04] that shows you where where he says we
[17:06] know we know we know and then also if
[17:10] we're if they'll scroll up then here's
[17:12] just a few that that Paul talks about
[17:15] about not being ignorant and it says for
[17:18] I would not Brethren that ye should be
[17:20] ignorant of this mystery unless you
[17:22] should be wise in your own conceit that
[17:24] blindness in part is happened to Israel
[17:27] until the fullness of the Gentiles be
[17:29] come in
[17:31] and he says First Corinthians 12 1 says
[17:33] I'm concerning spiritual gifts Brethren
[17:34] I would not have you ignorant
[17:37] second Corinthians 8 1 says but we would
[17:40] not Brethren have you ignorant of our
[17:41] trouble which came to us in Asia that we
[17:43] were pressed out of measure above
[17:46] strength and so much that we despair
[17:48] even of life
[17:51] and then second Peter 8 3 8 says but
[17:55] beloved be not ignorant of this one
[17:57] thing that one day with the Lord is a
[17:59] thousand years and a thousand years as
[18:01] one day
[18:03] so I just wanted to read that to you
[18:04] there's just a few scriptures that I had
[18:06] where Paul was and the scripture talks
[18:09] about knowing and to not be ignorant of
[18:12] and so there's you know there's you
[18:14] could spend a lot of time looking at
[18:16] each one of them and but I just wanted
[18:18] to look at a thought tonight and uh just
[18:22] look at a few things that that the
[18:24] prophet had to say but just to know that
[18:27] you know these are things that we know
[18:29] to know these things and not be ignorant
[18:32] of and you know Peter said you know he
[18:35] said stir up that he wanted to stir up
[18:37] your pure mind in a way of remembrance
[18:38] of these things not that you know not
[18:40] that you've heard these things before
[18:42] but it's good to go back home and just
[18:43] stir your mind and look at these things
[18:46] and realize who you are and
[18:51] just take a look at
[18:52] what the scripture has
[18:55] them you know many times when
[18:58] uh when you look at the word
[19:01] no and you know many times when people
[19:03] say you
[19:04] you know and
[19:07] when you're looking at things and if you
[19:08] have children you'll hear that a lot
[19:11] especially as they get to become
[19:12] teenagers you know because they always I
[19:14] know
[19:15] I know
[19:16] and you can tell them one thing and they
[19:19] know they know the problem is is they
[19:22] don't follow what you tell them but they
[19:24] know
[19:26] and they're real quick they say I'm not
[19:29] I know I know I know
[19:31] and he's like don't go outside don't do
[19:33] this don't make sure you do this take
[19:35] that with you I know I know
[19:37] and then there's all of a sudden uh they
[19:40] can't find their fault
[19:42] they can't find their shoes
[19:44] thank you for their homework
[19:46] and if you tell them go put that away
[19:48] put that up I know I know I know
[19:51] but they don't
[19:54] I said I already a story there was
[19:56] something about this this mom she
[19:58] started charging her family five dollars
[20:00] every time they had her look for
[20:02] something that was lost
[20:04] because she kept trying to tell him all
[20:05] the time about putting away their things
[20:07] and taking care of things and you know
[20:09] she got tired of you know trying to
[20:11] instruct them on what to do the next
[20:12] thing you know they're coming Mama
[20:13] where's my shoes what Mama wears this
[20:15] where's that so she started charging him
[20:16] five dollars after two years she bought
[20:18] her a new car
[20:20] well because people were telling them
[20:22] well I know I know
[20:25] well it it behooves us not to just be
[20:28] hearers of the word but uh but it's
[20:30] important to be doers of the word to be
[20:33] made to follow the word not just to know
[20:35] the word
[20:36] because you can know the word but the
[20:38] word just understanding the word just
[20:40] having mental knowledge of something
[20:41] doesn't help you
[20:43] but it's got to be something that takes
[20:44] place on the inside
[20:46] it's got to be something that we do
[20:50] and I was thinking and I I believe it
[20:53] was brother Dale many years ago he
[20:55] preached a message called I know
[20:58] and you know he started out just real
[21:01] simple saying I know and you know I know
[21:03] that the Bible is true
[21:05] I know Jesus loves me
[21:08] but then you know what it just started
[21:10] growing from there I know I know
[21:14] I know I know as as you come up through
[21:16] the statue of a perfect man I know what
[21:18] the new birth is
[21:20] and it just becomes I know what the
[21:21] seals are you just begin to climb
[21:23] through the scripture you start out I
[21:25] know
[21:25] you start out just at the bottom but you
[21:27] know as you go I know I don't you know I
[21:30] don't know if anybody else knows that
[21:31] and you may have confusion about it but
[21:33] this is something I know
[21:35] I know
[21:36] I walk this I've experienced this so
[21:39] this is mine
[21:40] I've had this experience I can tell you
[21:42] I know this I know this for a fact
[21:46] and that's one of the time sometimes
[21:47] when we go through things and we wonder
[21:50] where God's letting us know
[21:53] you know many times we go through we
[21:55] struggle with things with with you know
[21:58] problems and and diseases and situations
[22:01] like well I don't know if I can make it
[22:04] it's like well I don't see a way out
[22:08] what God wants you to know that there is
[22:10] a way out
[22:12] the thing is is you you can't say well I
[22:15] don't know
[22:16] I know
[22:19] well they say that when they don't look
[22:20] like there's a way inside I don't know
[22:22] what way should I go I know the way
[22:25] Jesus said I am the way
[22:28] so when I'm looking for a way that I'm
[22:30] trying to the problem is sometimes I'm
[22:31] trying to figure it out myself
[22:34] but the problem is is I don't go to the
[22:36] one that's got the answer
[22:38] so when I when I'm trying to figure it
[22:40] out myself I'm lacking because I don't
[22:42] know
[22:44] but he does
[22:46] so if I say well Lord I'm just gonna I'm
[22:48] just going to wait on you because they
[22:49] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[22:51] their strength so he's the one that has
[22:53] the way he he is the way he has the
[22:55] answer so that's what I'm gonna wait on
[22:57] him
[22:59] so if I just wait oh the Lord I'm just
[23:00] going to ask you
[23:03] I'm just gonna I'm just gonna lay this
[23:04] I'm gonna put my trust in you I'm just
[23:06] going to wait on you to give me an
[23:08] answer
[23:09] because if I try to I get frustrated I
[23:13] get worried and all these things but you
[23:15] know I have not put my trust in you
[23:19] but if we know that we can just wait on
[23:21] him and put our confidence in him wait
[23:24] on him
[23:25] he has the answer
[23:31] so he did you know because many times he
[23:34] didn't say that he was going to you know
[23:35] it's not always it's not always going to
[23:37] be a Divine Healing it's not always
[23:39] going to be miracles
[23:43] as but you know what if you wait on him
[23:45] because by his stripes we're already
[23:46] healed
[23:49] so before I ever got sick I was already
[23:51] healed
[23:54] so you know he was already the Healer
[23:55] before I ever got sick
[23:59] you know because the devil was already
[24:01] defeated before we ever got started
[24:04] but we don't see it that way
[24:08] because you know when you have when you
[24:11] have children when they're little then
[24:12] they they come to you know I remember
[24:14] when when especially Levi you know
[24:17] dad's a fixer
[24:21] I worked I worked at Chuck E cheese and
[24:23] I worked on machines and I was a fixer I
[24:26] got in maintenance and I was a fixer
[24:30] man I could hang everything from the
[24:32] Moon and just whatever it didn't matter
[24:34] I could fix it because I was a fixer
[24:38] had all the confidence in the world in
[24:39] me
[24:41] I work on stuff we got pictures of him
[24:43] he was trying I was working on a vacuum
[24:45] cleaner at the house he's in there
[24:47] trying to help me had a screwdriver man
[24:49] he was going to get in and work on that
[24:50] thing
[24:51] but he had confidence in me
[24:54] just simple childlike faith
[24:58] and you know that's all it takes
[25:01] that's all God is looking for simple
[25:05] childlike Faith just like that just that
[25:08] simple
[25:10] if we can just have that kind of
[25:11] confidence in him
[25:18] okay
[25:20] and here in the
[25:21] in the scripture when Paul's when Paul's
[25:25] speaking here of the scriptures we were
[25:27] reading tonight
[25:29] would get into
[25:31] even a few more scriptures tonight but
[25:34] when we begin to look here at the
[25:37] look at the children of Israel in their
[25:39] and their Journey as they were passing
[25:41] through and all the things that they had
[25:43] to face
[25:46] when all the things they had went
[25:47] through
[25:50] this is from the this is from the
[25:52] message from that time
[25:55] and brother Bram says and I was thinking
[25:57] of the assurance
[25:58] of our going over
[26:01] he said and then we noticed that one
[26:03] time God's children were slaves down in
[26:05] Egypt they throwed them bread moldy
[26:07] rotten whatever it was they had to eat
[26:10] it they ravished their girls they killed
[26:12] their sons anything they would
[26:15] and then was the people of God that's
[26:18] right
[26:19] now and so they were slaves and they
[26:22] could not help it
[26:23] but one day coming down out of the
[26:25] Wilderness come a prophet with a pill or
[26:27] fire over him and he told them the word
[26:30] of God that there was a land flowing
[26:32] with milk and honey that God had
[26:34] promised Abraham he'd take his children
[26:36] to and his promise was a Vindicated of
[26:39] being of God by the signs and wonders
[26:42] that he did while he was in Egypt and
[26:44] the people believed this man
[26:46] and he come out of Egypt the children of
[26:49] Israel did
[26:51] and came to the place of kadus Borneo
[26:53] which any scholar knows that Candice
[26:56] Barney at one time was the Judgment seat
[26:58] of the world
[27:00] that's where Israel met her judgment
[27:02] when she failed to believe the sign and
[27:05] they brought back the grapes and things
[27:07] from the land
[27:10] and he says now remember nobody had ever
[27:13] been in this land in their group
[27:17] they had heard of it Faith cometh by
[27:19] hearing and God made the promise you get
[27:22] it God made the promise and here comes
[27:24] Moses The Runaway prophet in there with
[27:27] Vindicated signs and proving that it was
[27:29] God taking them to this land that they'd
[27:32] never seen
[27:33] what a perfect type of today none of us
[27:36] has ever been over notice when they come
[27:38] to catus Barney of the the Judgment seat
[27:41] they had a great warrior among them
[27:43] named Joshua which means Jehovah's
[27:46] savior Joshua when he crossed over
[27:48] Jordan into that promised land and he
[27:50] returned back with the evidence that it
[27:51] was a good land he had grapes two men
[27:54] packed a bunch they could taste the
[27:56] Heavenly things from over in the
[27:57] promised land the good land flowing with
[28:00] milk and honey then come back to prove
[28:01] that the land was truth that God's word
[28:04] was exactly what Moses had said it was
[28:06] through the inspiration of God it was
[28:10] there
[28:11] foreign
[28:14] then continuing on
[28:16] scroll up just a little bit he says and
[28:18] they could have their own houses they
[28:20] could have their own homes documents of
[28:22] course they had to fight every inch of
[28:23] the road they took
[28:25] God told Joshua Joshua that whatever
[28:28] everywhere The Souls of your feet sits
[28:31] that's possession that's the way it is
[28:33] today everywhere the soles of your feet
[28:35] sit it's possession just keep walking
[28:38] Footprints means possession just take it
[28:40] and remember they had to fight every
[28:43] inch of the way some people can just
[28:45] take the two-handed sword and fight just
[28:47] a little bit of Shadow away some can cut
[28:51] through to Divine Healing every promise
[28:52] of God with it that's right the word is
[28:55] a sword that takes Faith to yield that
[28:57] sword that's right faith in the promised
[28:59] word now we notice that when they come
[29:02] back and they said that
[29:05] they could have their homes and so forth
[29:07] Israel crossed over into the promised
[29:09] land Built Homes raised children lived
[29:11] in peace and all the rest of the Nations
[29:13] respected them
[29:15] what a wonderful thing
[29:18] so when we talk about the the children
[29:20] of Israel and their and their Journey
[29:23] you know when God told Abraham that he
[29:26] said you know you're going to your
[29:28] descendants are going to sojourn in a
[29:30] Strange Land you have all this that
[29:32] you're going to have to go through but
[29:33] I've got a place for you we're going on
[29:36] a journey
[29:38] and when when the scriptures that we
[29:39] were reading that Paul was talking about
[29:41] you know when when he began to look at
[29:43] the the journey that the children of
[29:45] Israel had been on
[29:47] and the promise that was made the
[29:50] promise was made long before they ever
[29:51] some of those children never were born
[29:53] didn't even ever see Abraham didn't know
[29:55] anything about them except what they
[29:57] were been told but they told them there
[29:59] was a land that he had been promised
[30:01] that his four their forefather had
[30:03] walked
[30:05] his feet Abraham's Footprints were Laden
[30:07] laid in Canaan
[30:10] and he said you know what he promised
[30:12] that to us
[30:14] that was my promise
[30:16] that was somebody else's promise that
[30:18] was my promise he promised it to me
[30:23] but the problem was he said they stepped
[30:25] down there and they got stuck in Egypt
[30:28] and as they said in Egypt they their
[30:31] their mindset was just Egypt all they
[30:34] saw was Egypt that all they all like all
[30:36] I looked is brother I'm talking about
[30:37] they were down there and all they were
[30:39] under their task Masters and all they
[30:41] could say was Egypt
[30:44] and you know all they could say was all
[30:47] the bondage and and all the destruction
[30:49] and death and all this kind the misery
[30:51] that laid there that's all they saw they
[30:54] never saw anything else but as but in
[30:56] all that God's trying to reach them and
[30:58] tell them you know what you've got to
[30:59] land
[31:00] you've got a promise
[31:02] you've got to get up and go
[31:04] but you know when they got tired of
[31:06] being in Egypt
[31:08] now they didn't just sit down there and
[31:10] moan and groan because God come to Moses
[31:12] and began to speak to tell Moses he said
[31:15] I've heard to cry of my people by the
[31:18] reason of their task Masters so when
[31:20] they got to the place where they got
[31:21] tired of being down there and tired of
[31:23] going through all the things they've
[31:24] been through then they began to cry out
[31:25] to God because they realized you know
[31:27] what I've got a promise greater than
[31:28] this this is not my place to be this
[31:31] ain't what God promised me God promised
[31:34] me something greater than this and
[31:35] that's what I want amen I don't have to
[31:38] I don't have to be a Slave
[31:40] I might be a slave today but there's a
[31:42] day coming I don't have to be a Slave
[31:46] amen and so when they come to that place
[31:47] when the god when they begin to crowd
[31:49] then God sent the deliverer to them
[31:54] and guess what they sent a deliverer God
[31:56] sent a deliverer to them that had
[31:58] problems
[32:03] you know because everybody's like well
[32:05] you know everybody wants somebody that's
[32:07] that's you know everything's so right
[32:09] and so perfect and so pure
[32:12] but you know what you're not gonna find
[32:13] a human like that
[32:17] you know God's going to work through to
[32:19] you human Frailty and guess what if we
[32:21] look at everybody everybody's got faults
[32:23] everybody's got failures everybody's got
[32:24] problems
[32:26] right but you know what when you realize
[32:28] that it's not it's not the flash that
[32:30] you're looking at
[32:31] God don't want us looking at flesh we're
[32:33] not leaning on flesh but you know what
[32:36] it's God has come inside a flesh and
[32:38] that's what we're looking at God is
[32:41] inside a flesh
[32:43] God God is tabernacled in flesh and
[32:45] that's what he's using to to reach the
[32:48] people that's what he's using to speak
[32:50] that's what he's using to minister
[32:52] through
[32:54] and so you know and ever you know when
[32:56] we look at people everybody wants to
[32:57] know what kind of ministry when
[32:59] everybody looks well you know it's just
[33:00] the preachers or or you know no it's not
[33:03] everybody has a Ministry
[33:06] if you're part of the body of Christ you
[33:08] know what because you have a part to
[33:10] play in the in the body you're part of
[33:12] the ministry
[33:15] and everybody you know because you know
[33:17] I don't know what to do
[33:19] you know what you're you are to be an
[33:21] example to the world
[33:24] there's you know brother Mike said what
[33:26] can you do he said what are the two
[33:28] things that get closer to God he said
[33:29] read your Bible and pray
[33:32] well you know what if you want if you
[33:33] want to be a a benefit to people if you
[33:36] want to minister to somebody then pray
[33:38] right and if you got nobody else to pray
[33:41] then you pray twice for me
[33:45] but you know what if you can pray then
[33:47] you know what God God can work relaxed
[33:50] man
[33:50] you know what you know it does it does
[33:53] it doesn't it doesn't take a lot of
[33:54] intelligence
[33:56] you know because you know what the
[33:58] scripture tells us that you know if we
[34:00] have because when we don't know what to
[34:03] pray
[34:04] the scripture says that the spirit will
[34:06] speak
[34:08] with groaning so cannot be uttered
[34:12] so you know what when you when because
[34:14] when you know how many times have you
[34:16] begin to pray and you and you don't even
[34:18] know what to pray and all of a sudden
[34:19] the words become to come through your
[34:21] mouth and sometimes you will be amazed
[34:23] at what you're praying
[34:27] and you begin to pray over a situation
[34:29] and you're saying words to over a
[34:31] situation and you don't even know it's
[34:33] like why was I praying that and somebody
[34:35] comes back and says you said well you
[34:37] spoke exactly what needed to be said why
[34:39] because it's not you speaking
[34:41] but when we can yield to the Holy Spirit
[34:43] then the Holy Spirit can speak through
[34:45] us because he knows what needs to be
[34:47] said
[34:50] you know I tell everybody the worst the
[34:52] worst thing the worst mistake I ever
[34:54] made or one of the worst mistakes I ever
[34:56] made in my life that I still think about
[34:59] I I still to this day it bothers me
[35:04] brother Harold Hildebrandt came in and
[35:06] he preached in in Ruth North Carolina
[35:09] all week and he come preach Sunday here
[35:11] and he was sitting right over here and I
[35:13] was sitting we were standing right
[35:14] beside him
[35:15] and his his voice was gone
[35:18] that Sunday morning he could just barely
[35:20] whisper
[35:22] and the Lord kept telling me to lay my
[35:24] hands on him
[35:27] and he kept telling me you need to get
[35:29] just just and it's like get the brothers
[35:31] to pray he always need to pray over him
[35:33] his voice is gone
[35:35] and it was so it was so strong and you
[35:38] know I just I fought that and I fought
[35:40] that I felt that and it's like why
[35:42] because
[35:44] you know we sometimes we don't think we
[35:46] don't think we're worthy enough we don't
[35:48] think we ought to be doing that
[35:49] well if the Lord's gonna speak why did
[35:51] Brother why didn't brother Dale have the
[35:53] the why didn't the Lord speak to brother
[35:54] Dale to do that
[35:57] because you know what sometimes God's
[35:59] going to speak to you to see what you
[36:00] will do
[36:03] because everybody thinks well you know
[36:04] what it's got to be brother Dale or
[36:06] brother Wade or brother Bob because if
[36:07] it's not one of them or brother Terence
[36:09] you know then then you know it's we we
[36:11] can't we can't wait on somebody else to
[36:13] do it
[36:15] but Joe I I I got a quote in here I want
[36:19] to read later you know what brother I'm
[36:20] talking about having Divine Healing and
[36:22] taking place you know he said you know
[36:23] everybody's waiting on on the Evangelist
[36:26] to come he says you know he doesn't take
[36:27] the Evangelist prayer
[36:30] it's anybody's prayer
[36:33] but you know everybody's waiting on
[36:34] somebody and you know and I I never did
[36:36] I never did pray for brother Hildebrandt
[36:38] when he was standing here and you know
[36:40] that's that's bothered me for years
[36:45] and you know when he come out to preach
[36:47] the second service you know he could
[36:49] hardly he was even worse than he was
[36:50] that morning he just barely whispered I
[36:52] I was I was
[36:53] hey I've said it just felt like this
[36:56] great weight was sitting on me I was so
[36:58] I was under such condemnation
[37:03] and it's like you know what if that ever
[37:05] happens to me again I'm I'm not doing
[37:07] this again I may be wrong but you know
[37:10] if I feel if I feel led to do something
[37:12] I may be out of line but you know I
[37:14] would I would much rather do something
[37:17] because brother Randall said you know if
[37:18] you have the the desire to do something
[37:20] or you have the call to do something he
[37:22] said check it by the word
[37:26] well then you know what then it's our
[37:28] it's our responsibility as a body
[37:32] not well you know it's me you know I'm
[37:34] not like everybody else
[37:38] see we we get and it's good to be humble
[37:42] but sometimes people try to get so
[37:43] humble that we get out of our position
[37:45] we get out of our place that's not where
[37:47] God wants us to be
[37:49] right yeah we can be we're late we're at
[37:52] least in the body we say well I'm the
[37:54] least in the Kingdom as Paul said but
[37:56] you know what that doesn't mean that God
[37:58] can't speak to us and use us if we get
[38:00] to the place and we get so and we get so
[38:02] humble that we that we're useless
[38:06] that God's not going to speak no
[38:08] we shouldn't think higher than we that
[38:10] we are but we shouldn't get to the place
[38:12] where God's not well I can't the God
[38:14] can't use me
[38:17] because you know that that's not part of
[38:19] the body
[38:20] that's not benefit to anybody
[38:24] but you know when I got to that place
[38:25] you know I thought you know Lord if if
[38:27] something comes to me I I never get away
[38:29] from I I just have to
[38:32] and brother after brother Danny Fountain
[38:34] had his accident
[38:38] I was sitting back here
[38:41] and the Lord began to it just same it
[38:44] was just all I pray for brother Dane he
[38:46] was I think he was sitting over here in
[38:48] a chair
[38:49] and I called all the brothers said we
[38:50] got to pray for today I don't know why I
[38:52] don't know why
[38:55] but we we just all got together over
[38:57] here and prayed over him
[39:00] and you know anytime the Lord just deals
[39:03] with me in a way like that
[39:06] you know it's like you know we don't
[39:08] want to speak to people or we see people
[39:10] coming down the street or or certain
[39:12] situations you know if if the Lord
[39:14] begins to deal with me he's like Lord
[39:15] you know either either stop me because I
[39:18] I just I just feel so impressed to do
[39:20] stuff
[39:24] but he said he said those that are sons
[39:26] of God are led by the spirit of God
[39:29] but sometimes we don't want to we we we
[39:31] get to the place that we you know we're
[39:33] feel like that we're So Unworthy
[39:36] that we can't be used of God that God
[39:38] can't speak to me
[39:40] to do you know it's like well you know
[39:42] somebody else said no
[39:44] sometimes God uses us
[39:47] God's going to speak to you to speak to
[39:49] somebody
[39:53] it's not always it's not always the
[39:55] preachers
[40:01] foreign
[40:02] but you know when when God Called Moses
[40:05] to go down there and be a deliverer we
[40:07] know that you know Moses he had his
[40:09] faults and he had his failures
[40:13] here's a man that was the second highest
[40:15] man there in all of Egypt
[40:17] this great leader in Egypt but you know
[40:19] God told him he said that's not your
[40:21] position
[40:22] you know through his mom told him he
[40:24] said listen that's not you're not you're
[40:26] not one of them
[40:28] that's not who you are
[40:30] you're a deliverer you're a Hebrew
[40:35] God didn't call you to sit on the throne
[40:37] in Egypt
[40:40] brother Brown said that you know it took
[40:42] all those years of him having all of
[40:44] that education and all of that learning
[40:47] all of that that he went through in
[40:48] Egypt
[40:49] had 40 Years of all that great knowledge
[40:52] and all that beat in you know taught
[40:54] into him learned all that stuff and then
[40:56] it took 40 years to get it out of him
[41:00] and why because those 40 years that he
[41:02] was there to see and understand how all
[41:05] that was the great great nation the
[41:08] great Empire of Egypt
[41:12] and had everything at his fingertips
[41:16] and then the next thing you know he's a
[41:18] nobody in the desert watching over sheep
[41:25] nobody knew he was there and nobody
[41:27] cared
[41:29] but you know that's where God wanted him
[41:32] why because it molded Moses into who he
[41:35] was
[41:37] and when when he got to the place where
[41:39] God wanted him to be after all that he
[41:41] had been through and all things that he
[41:42] had seen and all that he had suffered
[41:45] then guess what God had a supernatural
[41:48] event for him
[41:50] met him in a burning bush and began to
[41:52] speak to him
[41:54] he said you know what you you know what
[41:56] you were called to be you're called to
[41:58] be a deliverer
[41:59] that's your job that's what your calling
[42:02] is that's what and now it's time for you
[42:04] to go forth
[42:07] and in the in the midst of of him
[42:09] calling him and telling Moses this is
[42:11] what God God's called you to this
[42:15] and he's like oh I I can't do this I
[42:18] can't speak I don't I don't I don't have
[42:20] you know I'm So Unworthy it can't be me
[42:25] and what God do God began to tell him
[42:27] listen you are the one that's going to
[42:29] deliver these people and I'm going to be
[42:30] with you and I'm going to give you two
[42:32] signs to show the people that you're
[42:34] gonna that you're gonna be the one
[42:37] and you're not going alone but you're
[42:40] going to have a mouthpiece you're going
[42:42] to have a prophet go with you and that's
[42:43] your brother
[42:44] you're going down there but you know
[42:46] you're going to be the one that's going
[42:47] to stand before pharaoh and telling the
[42:50] the days of my people being in bondage
[42:53] are over with
[42:54] you're going to go in front of and tell
[42:56] them let my people go
[43:00] he's like oh no I'm not going to let him
[43:02] go
[43:03] but you know all the things that that
[43:05] Moses went through you know
[43:08] God was with him and God led him all the
[43:10] way through all of that
[43:12] and God was leading him and dealing with
[43:14] him the whole time
[43:15] and told him said listen I'm going to
[43:17] harden Pharaoh's heart
[43:19] and he's not going to let y'all go
[43:23] but you know what you're still going to
[43:24] go down there and tell him let my people
[43:26] go
[43:28] but don't worry because you know what in
[43:30] the end it's going to happen
[43:34] now here he has to go down there and the
[43:36] greatest and the greatest nation in the
[43:38] world and the greatest
[43:40] Empire
[43:41] of all the whole world and he's got to
[43:43] go down there
[43:47] after living 40 years on the backside of
[43:49] the desert dealing with sheep
[43:52] he didn't look like nobody nobody wanted
[43:54] to see
[43:56] but you know what it wasn't the position
[43:58] that he was in it's the God that he had
[44:00] it's the God that he served his God made
[44:03] God made a way for him
[44:06] he went before pharaoh and told her he
[44:08] said you're gonna let my people go
[44:11] but we don't understand that when all
[44:13] that took place and God put him in the
[44:15] right position to be there why because
[44:17] it was going to tear down all of Egypt
[44:22] because he said well guess what you
[44:24] don't want to let him go that's fine
[44:26] guess what we got to wait take care of
[44:27] this
[44:28] we've got we've got these plaques
[44:31] and each one of these plagues are going
[44:33] to attack each one of your Gods your
[44:34] deities we're going to tear them all
[44:35] down
[44:37] and everything that went forth every
[44:39] time that Moses was doing something he
[44:41] was showing that God was the one in
[44:42] control he was the one that was leading
[44:44] all this not anything that the Pharaoh
[44:47] had or anything that Egypt had
[44:51] and it began to show the people that
[44:53] were there
[44:54] he began to show the children of Israel
[44:56] that you know what God had a way for
[44:58] them that God after after you sing all
[45:01] of that and living all of that that
[45:03] Egypt had and all the gods and and
[45:05] everything then you know what all of a
[45:08] sudden when Moses come and said you know
[45:10] what that's fine he said we're just
[45:11] going to turn all the waters to blood
[45:15] the Mighty the Mighty the mighty Nile
[45:18] River and all these things and began to
[45:20] see how each one of those the Flies and
[45:22] the fleas and the frogs and the Darkness
[45:24] all these things that took place each
[45:26] one of those things that came to them
[45:27] was showing that their gods didn't have
[45:29] any control over that
[45:31] right but Moses began to tell the people
[45:34] look this is the same God that's leading
[45:36] you out look at this miracle that's took
[45:38] in place
[45:39] look what took place here well look what
[45:42] take place here and all the way as it
[45:44] goes along God doing the work before
[45:45] them showing and he's the one that's
[45:47] going to lead you out
[45:50] and it just kept taking place and kept
[45:52] taking place but you know then finally
[45:54] when they got to the place then God told
[45:56] them that now it's the time after the
[45:58] after the death of the firstborn now
[46:00] it's time to go get ready
[46:03] when they began to see all these things
[46:05] it's like yeah I I can see now's the
[46:07] time to get ready and to go we gotta we
[46:09] got to follow the word of Moses we got
[46:10] we've got to get our shoes on we got to
[46:12] get our staff we got to get ready Now's
[46:14] the Time to get out
[46:16] and when they when they got out and to
[46:18] leave and they began to eat the lamb and
[46:20] take the blood and put it on the
[46:22] doorposts and all those things and get
[46:23] ready to go
[46:25] after they'd seen all those Miracles
[46:27] take place and God had brought them that
[46:29] far and brought him into the to a place
[46:31] to get out the and they seen all that
[46:34] all the Miracles that had taken place
[46:36] and then they began to walk out
[46:39] it's it's a mind-blowing situation
[46:41] because before that they were down there
[46:43] and they saw no way it was totally
[46:45] hopeless that was absolutely nothing
[46:46] that was going to take them out of that
[46:50] why because they were so in the in the
[46:53] in had that all ingrained in them all
[46:56] about Egypt how wonderful How Great and
[46:58] Mighty Egypt was
[47:00] until God come began to deal with them
[47:02] and show them what what he had done
[47:08] they had they they went from absolutely
[47:10] doing nothing moving in no Direction
[47:14] until God began to speak to him and you
[47:16] know what they got ready to walk out
[47:20] God began to do do something that they
[47:23] would you know what I'm ready to go I'm
[47:25] eating this with lamb and I'm getting
[47:26] out of here
[47:29] and two and a half million people began
[47:31] to get up and walk out
[47:35] and you know it's in America when you
[47:37] when you think about it that's a what a
[47:38] what a mind-blowing miracle that was
[47:40] that they got together and left
[47:46] if you if you've been under such bondage
[47:48] for so long
[47:51] and you never had anything to yourself
[47:54] but now there's a way made and you're
[47:56] actually leaving the bondage you're
[47:58] actually walking out
[48:02] I mean what a mind-blowing experience to
[48:04] realize you know after I've lived in
[48:06] this my my dad's been in this bondage my
[48:09] grandparents been in this bondage and
[48:10] now I'm walking out
[48:13] after 400 years of my ancestors being
[48:15] down here I'm leaving
[48:17] and I'm walking out
[48:20] to say What miracles took place for me
[48:23] to have that happen to me when that
[48:25] happened and I began to walk out then
[48:27] then when the when Pharaoh's Army began
[48:29] to chase them then all of a sudden they
[48:31] were paralyzed with fear
[48:34] they were back in a bondage again
[48:36] because now oh no here they come
[48:40] why because God wanted real you know
[48:42] what I've did I've defeated them all the
[48:44] way up till now
[48:46] they've been defeated every single time
[48:51] and there's Moses crying to God
[48:56] but what do you want him to see
[49:00] there's another great Victory ahead of
[49:02] you
[49:08] right here it is now you're coming up he
[49:10] said he said this this Army this this
[49:13] enemy that you see
[49:15] your oppression
[49:17] all all of this that you've been through
[49:19] all the way up till now
[49:21] he said this he said this Army that you
[49:24] see
[49:25] he said you'll never see him again
[49:30] but you know what they had to get to the
[49:32] place where God could lead them to the
[49:34] place that they got when they got to the
[49:36] place where God wanted them to get to
[49:39] then when Moses is down there crying he
[49:41] said why are you crying to me Moses he
[49:43] said speak the word and go forward
[49:47] did he give Moses they give Moses the
[49:49] words to speak and the Y and the Red Sea
[49:52] opened
[49:53] he knew which way to go because God was
[49:55] leading him it wasn't Moses playing it
[49:58] wasn't Moses intelligence it was the
[50:00] plan of God God was leading him and he
[50:02] began to speak the waters opened
[50:06] and here they are walking on dry ground
[50:10] here they are walking across on dry two
[50:13] and a half million people
[50:16] when you step out there every single day
[50:18] then you see this Mighty River
[50:21] that Chicago probably couldn't hardly
[50:23] see all the way across it
[50:25] it's great see all this water everywhere
[50:31] no telling how deep it was
[50:37] when you when you come to this then you
[50:39] see it all of a sudden the water's
[50:41] parked
[50:42] and you see these giant walls of water
[50:44] on each side of you
[50:48] and I'm sure it wasn't no and what I'm
[50:49] sure it wasn't no 36 inch wide path that
[50:51] they were walking
[50:56] so here here it is this great expanse
[50:59] has opened up in front of them
[51:02] and it's dry all the way across
[51:07] this Supernatural is happening in front
[51:09] of them and here they are walking all
[51:11] this way in front on this dry ground
[51:15] Supernatural happening everywhere
[51:17] they're seeing this great happening here
[51:19] they are going out
[51:23] and they're worried about the Army
[51:24] that's coming behind them
[51:27] but the word is already told them listen
[51:29] don't you worry about him coming behind
[51:30] you
[51:32] that's not a problem he said because
[51:34] you'll never see them anymore after
[51:36] today
[51:37] right
[51:38] why because they were because God called
[51:41] the children of Israel to go one way
[51:44] and they the Egyptian Army wasn't
[51:47] designed to go that way God didn't call
[51:49] them to go that way
[51:51] but they started to try to go the exact
[51:53] same way
[51:55] and when they got to the right place
[51:58] and guess what
[52:00] God pulled his hands back the waters
[52:03] come back and washed them all away and
[52:05] drowned them
[52:08] and here they are all destroyed and then
[52:10] all of a sudden you know now now they're
[52:11] over there tambourines and clapping and
[52:14] everybody's so happy
[52:17] but you know what all that rejoicing
[52:21] they come all that way
[52:23] and they're rejoicing with short-lived
[52:27] because the next time they had a bump in
[52:30] the road
[52:31] next time they had a little bit of
[52:33] problems everything every time every
[52:36] little discomfort that they had
[52:39] they stopped and had to complain well I
[52:42] don't like this and I don't like that we
[52:43] don't have any water
[52:46] and you're out here trying to kill us
[52:50] when the whole time he God's trying to
[52:53] tell him listen I got you a place
[52:55] and I'm trying to take you there and you
[52:57] know what all The Supernaturals happened
[52:58] all the way in front of you to show you
[53:00] that I'm right here leading you
[53:04] but they've missed they've missed the
[53:06] supernatural
[53:09] and don't believe that God is actually
[53:11] trying to move them
[53:13] and lead them to the place
[53:21] but God was
[53:23] faithful all the way in everywhere that
[53:25] he went leading them and show him that
[53:28] he was in charge that he was leading
[53:29] them
[53:36] but they didn't have faith to believe
[53:40] after all that they had seen after all
[53:42] that they had heard
[53:45] as they were leaving they still
[53:47] complaining
[53:48] still have you know oh we could just go
[53:51] back
[53:54] who wants to go back
[53:57] all right
[54:00] no there's something greater
[54:03] when you got two and a half million
[54:05] people marching along and all of a
[54:07] sudden you got you got
[54:10] all you know all of
[54:12] these are complaining and you only got
[54:15] two
[54:17] that come out of all of that
[54:20] two that come out of all of that and you
[54:22] know they had their minds set on what
[54:24] God had promised them
[54:27] here was two and a half million people
[54:28] coming out seeing the supernatural God
[54:30] lead them all the way
[54:32] and when they when they murmured and
[54:34] complained you know what God forgave and
[54:35] said come on let's go
[54:37] give them what they had need of fed them
[54:39] took care of them
[54:42] never got sick never got old never had
[54:44] problems God taken care of them the
[54:46] whole way
[54:49] but they never could they never could
[54:51] get to the place to realize you know
[54:53] God's leading me and I have confidence
[54:55] in that you know I'm going into that
[54:56] land
[54:59] when they got to kadish Barney and told
[55:01] them it's time to go you know they they
[55:03] couldn't fight even after when he
[55:05] brought the evidence back
[55:07] and showed them what was in the land
[55:12] when the when the spies gave the report
[55:14] and told them listen that's exactly the
[55:16] way it is in the in the land just like
[55:18] the way he said it was
[55:21] and you got you got 10 people that have
[55:23] walked through that land
[55:27] ten spies those 10 Witnesses when they
[55:31] went through that land and said hey it's
[55:33] exactly what he said
[55:35] but you know what
[55:37] we are we are not strong enough to take
[55:39] them
[55:41] I know I know that I know that God was
[55:44] the one that that brought us out of
[55:46] Egypt when we when we were in bondage
[55:50] and and all we never had anything and
[55:52] all the problems that we had down there
[55:53] and we walked up there to the Red Sea
[55:56] and it parted and you know and all the
[55:58] things and we seen the water come out of
[55:59] the rock and all these things that we've
[56:01] seen and witnessed but you know what
[56:03] God's not God's not we're not able
[56:07] to what it wasn't them that got that far
[56:10] all right
[56:13] it wasn't God it was God it had led them
[56:15] that far and everything that they had
[56:16] God was the one that brought them that
[56:18] far it wasn't them right
[56:23] right but you here's here the children
[56:25] of Israel when they get there but there
[56:27] was two so hey
[56:28] when they begin to the crowd we can't we
[56:31] can't we're we're so small you know and
[56:34] we look like grasshoppers in their sight
[56:36] it's it's so bad it's so bad
[56:39] and here's here's Joshua and Caleb
[56:42] trying to steal the people
[56:44] trying to get the hysteria down so they
[56:47] can tell them say listen this is what
[56:49] God Said
[56:51] God brought us this far and he's going
[56:53] to carry us all the way
[56:55] and then whatever you have need of God
[56:57] will meet your need
[56:58] because God gave it to us
[57:01] now the only thing that we got to do is
[57:03] go forward
[57:05] that's all we got to do we got to go
[57:07] forward and walk in it
[57:10] because you know what the battle's not
[57:11] mine it's his
[57:14] why because he's the one that promised
[57:16] it to us
[57:18] but you know what they they couldn't
[57:19] they couldn't accept what God had done
[57:21] for them
[57:23] but you got to you but you got to walk
[57:25] forward
[57:26] you got to take what God Said and move
[57:28] forward
[57:32] now this is this is from the message the
[57:34] True Vine and faults Vine
[57:36] and brother Brown is is speaking to a
[57:39] to a lady in the in the in the prayer
[57:41] line and he says he said what do you
[57:43] think sister he said Do you believe with
[57:45] all your heart
[57:46] he said all right if you believe it's
[57:48] for you
[57:50] he said God honors Believers isn't that
[57:53] right
[57:54] but to him that believeth if I didn't
[57:57] say one thing to you
[57:59] and laid hands on you do you believe
[58:01] you'd be healed anyhow don't you see I
[58:05] like that kind of Faith have faith in
[58:07] God
[58:12] and we'll go to the next quote there and
[58:15] and and so here's here's brother Brandon
[58:17] he's speaking of people this is from the
[58:19] second hand rope and you know he's
[58:21] speaking of people
[58:23] and you know they're they're going to
[58:26] you know when brother talks about them
[58:27] going to a witch because they had faith
[58:29] in her that when they went to her that
[58:31] they could get healed
[58:34] and he says but the poor people that's
[58:36] approaching coming they're thinking
[58:37] they're approaching God and God has to
[58:40] honor faith
[58:42] I don't care where it's at and they
[58:45] approach God through the witch they
[58:47] think they're coming to God coming
[58:49] through there and God's got to honor
[58:51] that faith
[58:55] so that's what God honors is their faith
[58:58] because they believe they're approaching
[58:59] God through that situation
[59:01] and that's what God was looking for he
[59:03] was looking for them to have faith
[59:05] because he brought them all that way he
[59:07] showed them all the evidence and he
[59:08] brought them all that way and showing
[59:10] them where they were at but they had to
[59:12] have faith in what God Said
[59:14] they had to have faith to believe what
[59:16] God had said
[59:19] and it come and showed it to him
[59:22] and if we could just put our faith in
[59:24] and understand that that we could
[59:26] overcome
[59:28] if we have faith in what God Said
[59:32] that's right and as you know as as the
[59:34] scripture we were reading you know all
[59:36] the things that the children of Israel
[59:37] had been through and all the things that
[59:39] they had seen
[59:41] because you know what the scripture says
[59:43] they it was not mixed with faith
[59:46] all the word that they'd heard was not
[59:48] mixed by with faith
[59:53] and this is from the message
[59:54] desperations
[1:00:02] and brother I'm talking about
[1:00:04] being overseas and and
[1:00:08] the the meetings and and everything
[1:00:11] and he and he says and he's talking he
[1:00:13] said and we gotta we got to get the
[1:00:15] seasons where it's not raining and
[1:00:17] pouring down rain
[1:00:19] and those people sitting out there
[1:00:22] I've seen people sit out there with
[1:00:23] their hair just stringing down Fine
[1:00:25] dress people
[1:00:27] and just just sit in that rain all day
[1:00:31] just sat there and it's just pouring and
[1:00:33] thundering and lightning and storms blow
[1:00:35] and them just weaving back and forth
[1:00:38] against one another like that setting
[1:00:39] right there wait till you come to pray
[1:00:42] for them
[1:00:44] see now you know God honors Faith like
[1:00:48] that
[1:00:48] he does
[1:00:51] and he says you've got to do something
[1:00:53] for God to honor
[1:00:55] see you show him the people that's got
[1:00:58] everything handed to them so easy they
[1:01:00] don't usually they they don't do nothing
[1:01:03] for it you see you've got to the gift is
[1:01:06] free that is true but you've got to it
[1:01:09] seems like that you know
[1:01:12] like they say if he was born with a
[1:01:15] silver spoon you've heard that you don't
[1:01:17] appreciate but when you have to work for
[1:01:19] it you appreciate the value of it
[1:01:23] you know and brother random was talking
[1:01:26] about
[1:01:27] one time he he was talking about being
[1:01:30] over
[1:01:32] in the in the the uh over season and in
[1:01:36] the different places and and he began to
[1:01:38] talk about
[1:01:40] uh
[1:01:42] being in the Tabernacle and he said you
[1:01:44] know it's so hot in here and you know
[1:01:45] we're so crowded and all this and he
[1:01:47] said but you know we shouldn't complain
[1:01:48] about what we have here
[1:01:50] and he told me and he said you know when
[1:01:52] you look to see what people have
[1:01:53] overseas and and he talks about you know
[1:01:55] they go out there early in the morning
[1:01:58] and they and they stay out there all day
[1:02:02] and he said you know they lean against
[1:02:03] each other and he said you know people
[1:02:05] that are sick and The Afflicted he said
[1:02:07] they stack them up
[1:02:08] just trying to hear one word from God
[1:02:13] and then here they are all leaned up
[1:02:15] against each other people that are dying
[1:02:17] and they're and they're stacking them up
[1:02:19] and and all of those situations just to
[1:02:22] hear one word
[1:02:23] just to hear one word from God
[1:02:26] Desiring because they they know here's
[1:02:29] here's the words of life this is all
[1:02:31] that's all it takes is just this one
[1:02:33] word
[1:02:35] and and he and he talks about
[1:02:38] uh that time where
[1:02:41] um
[1:02:42] he was uh and overseas somewhere and you
[1:02:46] know had the Storm come up and and you
[1:02:49] know he's sitting in his room and
[1:02:50] he was uh
[1:02:52] talking about the uh the room
[1:02:55] and he was talking about he said he said
[1:02:57] the trees look like they were falling
[1:02:58] over and you know it's so windy and
[1:03:01] rainy and stormy and thundered and
[1:03:02] lightning and and he thought well you
[1:03:04] know he said ain't nobody gonna be down
[1:03:05] there
[1:03:08] and all and all that storm
[1:03:10] nobody gonna be down there and he's like
[1:03:12] well I might as well just you know
[1:03:14] not get ready
[1:03:16] and he said next thing you know the car
[1:03:18] backs up there's a knock at the door or
[1:03:20] whatever and that man tells him said
[1:03:22] come on time to go
[1:03:25] and he's like do what
[1:03:27] he said there's people down there in
[1:03:29] that storm
[1:03:31] and that man told him he said he said
[1:03:33] you can't get within blocks of that
[1:03:34] place
[1:03:37] he said in all that storm he said yeah
[1:03:39] he said they want to hear from God
[1:03:42] right
[1:03:44] they want to hear a word from God
[1:03:48] and go through all that storm and
[1:03:49] everything
[1:03:52] and not real you know and we think we
[1:03:55] have it so good
[1:03:58] and we've had so many things happen and
[1:04:00] and been so blessed of all the things
[1:04:02] that's happened that's come our way
[1:04:04] that God has done for us
[1:04:07] and yet
[1:04:08] we don't honor that
[1:04:11] we don't respect that we don't we don't
[1:04:13] honor what God has done
[1:04:17] you know because if if we if you're sick
[1:04:22] you know the the devil wants to wants to
[1:04:24] give you a reason not to do anything
[1:04:30] and you know I I I'm just as guilty as
[1:04:33] anybody else
[1:04:35] but you I you know it just lays on me
[1:04:39] sometimes
[1:04:41] you know because it's good to have
[1:04:43] somebody come behind and say and speak
[1:04:45] to you in love and say listen
[1:04:49] don't give up
[1:04:53] sometimes we're just like him folks down
[1:04:55] in Egypt that's all we've seen
[1:04:59] we've seen the same situation over and
[1:05:01] over and over
[1:05:04] we've seen we've seen our loved ones in
[1:05:06] the same condition and ain't got any
[1:05:08] better
[1:05:10] we've seen our children out in the world
[1:05:12] and ain't got any better
[1:05:13] and sometimes it's gotten worse and
[1:05:15] worse and worse
[1:05:18] I got I I'm sick I got I got whatever
[1:05:23] and you know every time I go to the
[1:05:24] doctor it just gets worse and worse and
[1:05:26] worse I ain't any better
[1:05:30] just like it just like that woman had
[1:05:32] come had the issue a blood
[1:05:35] spent all she had she went to all kind
[1:05:37] of doctors kept going you know what she
[1:05:38] kept getting worse she didn't get any
[1:05:39] better
[1:05:41] than all she could spend all she had
[1:05:43] didn't do one or didn't do her one bit
[1:05:45] of good
[1:05:48] but you know somewhere along the way she
[1:05:49] got in her mind she said that he's the
[1:05:52] Healer
[1:05:54] and no doubt she had seen Jesus heal
[1:05:57] people
[1:05:58] and no doubt she might even known people
[1:05:59] that got healed
[1:06:01] and see what God could do
[1:06:04] and see what God had done and you know
[1:06:05] what she didn't have to read in the
[1:06:07] scripture and wonder well I wonder if I
[1:06:09] should
[1:06:12] there was something that spoke to her
[1:06:15] that rose up inside our wherever where
[1:06:17] she said where was the scripture says
[1:06:19] you touch his garments you get healed
[1:06:24] but somewhere along the way there was
[1:06:26] something that something struck her that
[1:06:29] she said if I can just touch but the Hem
[1:06:31] of His Garment she said why because he's
[1:06:34] got the healing power
[1:06:37] I don't have to have him say anything
[1:06:39] over me I don't have to have him lay his
[1:06:42] hand on me all I got to do is just Touch
[1:06:44] the Hem of His Garment and I can be ate
[1:06:46] whole
[1:06:48] and she went into that crowd
[1:06:53] and maybe that was a that was the
[1:06:55] closest she ever got to Jesus
[1:06:58] you know what she didn't run to the end
[1:06:59] of the town and hide so well maybe Jesus
[1:07:02] will come this way and I'll wait on him
[1:07:07] she didn't wait on Jesus to come past
[1:07:09] her way she knew where he was at and she
[1:07:12] was fighting her way through the crowd
[1:07:15] she was pressing her way in
[1:07:18] and she fall all the way to Jesus
[1:07:23] when everybody's bumping shoulder to
[1:07:24] shoulder she might have had to crawl
[1:07:27] he didn't stop her
[1:07:30] she knew where she was going
[1:07:33] she had she had a vision she had a goal
[1:07:36] she had a plan and she didn't stop till
[1:07:37] she got there
[1:07:41] and just barely touching just a little
[1:07:43] bit of His Garment that he never felt
[1:07:46] humanly
[1:07:49] but there was something Supernatural
[1:07:51] they took because she had Faith to do to
[1:07:54] believe and to act on that
[1:07:58] and they was like who touched me
[1:08:01] why because she she had faith in God
[1:08:03] because she had faith in who he was and
[1:08:06] what he could do
[1:08:08] so he honored that faith and God healed
[1:08:10] her
[1:08:13] and said that's the kind of faith that
[1:08:15] it takes it just takes just a simple but
[1:08:18] you've got to act on it
[1:08:23] but you know as as the as the children
[1:08:26] of Israel you know when they went all
[1:08:27] those years and and went to kadish
[1:08:29] Barney and God began to deal with them
[1:08:30] and tell them listen you could cross
[1:08:32] over you can cross over into this land
[1:08:35] you're more than conquerors to take this
[1:08:37] land it belongs to you
[1:08:39] it's always belonged to you
[1:08:43] but the question is are you going to
[1:08:45] take it
[1:08:48] and when they went there then when they
[1:08:50] wouldn't accept what God had done for
[1:08:52] them what God had made a way already for
[1:08:55] them
[1:08:56] then when they went all that way then
[1:08:58] they said listen he said your your
[1:09:00] carcasses will rot in the wilderness
[1:09:05] but then you know what after God tells
[1:09:07] them you can't go in then they want to
[1:09:09] rise oh hey we're going to take it now
[1:09:13] your time's up you're done
[1:09:17] God's judgment already fell on them
[1:09:20] you can't go any further
[1:09:22] you're done
[1:09:26] but he said your children
[1:09:28] who you thought would be a pray to them
[1:09:30] said they're going to raise up
[1:09:33] and they're going in and take that land
[1:09:38] but you know what it never it never
[1:09:40] dimmed
[1:09:42] Joshua's Vision it never damned Caleb's
[1:09:45] vision
[1:09:47] the whole time they were there
[1:09:51] you know I you can just see old Caleb
[1:09:54] out there knowing that land laid there
[1:09:58] for 40 years
[1:10:01] walking around with a bunch of grumbling
[1:10:03] complaining
[1:10:05] whiny people
[1:10:09] he walked around with them same old
[1:10:12] people over and over and had to listen
[1:10:14] to the same old complaints
[1:10:19] but I guarantee you oh oh Caleb was out
[1:10:22] somewhere and you know what he had a
[1:10:24] sword somewhere in his hand and you know
[1:10:25] what he was doing
[1:10:27] he sat there and I bet he was doing this
[1:10:29] the whole time sharpening that sword
[1:10:31] chicken that made you guys I got a good
[1:10:33] Edge on it I don't know when I'm going
[1:10:36] but I'm going
[1:10:37] I got a good Edge on that sword
[1:10:41] well it's been one two
[1:10:43] three ten years
[1:10:45] 15.
[1:10:50] might have started getting gray headed
[1:10:51] might have started losing his hair
[1:10:54] might started being a little humped over
[1:10:56] but you know what didn't hell it didn't
[1:10:58] stop him
[1:10:59] didn't hinder him
[1:11:02] every single day you know what I'm what
[1:11:04] are you 85 years old he's stood there
[1:11:06] something just as good
[1:11:08] and the day I walked through that land
[1:11:13] right I'm a witness I've been in the
[1:11:16] land
[1:11:18] because our Father Abraham walked in
[1:11:23] this land
[1:11:24] he walked in this land
[1:11:27] and and Caleb he didn't see the Giants
[1:11:30] he didn't see all the hindrances
[1:11:34] he saw the promise of God
[1:11:36] I'm walking in the land
[1:11:38] that our forefathers walked in
[1:11:42] I'm walking in what God promised me
[1:11:46] and I can just see oh it's going to be
[1:11:48] great when we get over here
[1:11:50] it's great
[1:11:52] ain't nothing like it
[1:11:55] and you know what in all those years
[1:11:57] that he went to he wasn't hindered by
[1:11:59] any of that
[1:12:01] he was happy
[1:12:03] 40 years having to put up all them crazy
[1:12:06] people over there
[1:12:08] no doubt he went out there sometimes
[1:12:10] probably see a few of them die a few
[1:12:12] thousand of them die here there well
[1:12:14] that's a few more we don't have to deal
[1:12:16] with
[1:12:17] because we're getting closer
[1:12:20] we're getting closer to going over
[1:12:23] I'm getting closer going over I'm
[1:12:25] getting better I ain't getting I'm
[1:12:26] getting older I ain't getting worse
[1:12:27] ain't getting more problems no I'm
[1:12:29] getting ready to go over
[1:12:31] I got what I what I come for
[1:12:34] I got it it's been revealed to me and I
[1:12:38] am not stopping till I get there
[1:12:42] and brothers and sisters it's the same
[1:12:43] way
[1:12:46] whatever you have need of it's the same
[1:12:48] thing
[1:12:50] because if God if God has started you on
[1:12:54] a journey
[1:12:56] Richard and I was talking about that the
[1:12:58] other day
[1:13:00] how in the world did we end up in Lula
[1:13:02] Georgia
[1:13:07] how in the world do you go from North
[1:13:09] Carolina to Tennessee all the way to
[1:13:11] Lula Georgia
[1:13:16] you know you can't you can't write this
[1:13:21] I mean you know he wrote fiction people
[1:13:23] wouldn't believe this probably
[1:13:26] but you know what it's a supernatural
[1:13:29] event
[1:13:30] sometimes we don't we don't think of it
[1:13:32] that way
[1:13:33] but you know what's the leading of the
[1:13:35] Lord has led us all this way
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:44] and God's trying to try to encourage us
[1:13:47] to realize Who We Are
[1:13:49] God's brought us this far guess what
[1:13:51] ain't done with us
[1:13:53] we're going all the way
[1:13:56] whether and you know there's so many
[1:13:59] people that's been sick and
[1:14:02] and Afflicted and and carried all these
[1:14:04] things but you know what
[1:14:09] it just serves something inside of me
[1:14:11] because you know what it it's not just
[1:14:14] them that has to pray
[1:14:16] it's our job to pray for them
[1:14:20] we're a body
[1:14:24] and you know if if we're a body and I'm
[1:14:26] not talking about just this this
[1:14:27] building and I'm just not talking about
[1:14:29] the people that come to this this
[1:14:31] congregation I'm talking about the body
[1:14:33] of Believers worldwide
[1:14:38] because you know what
[1:14:41] God thinks just as much of the people in
[1:14:43] China as he does us
[1:14:46] and whether they have anything in in
[1:14:49] Nepal or India
[1:14:52] you know what there's there's the
[1:14:53] children of God just like we are
[1:14:57] right and you know that we pray for them
[1:14:59] and they pray for us
[1:15:03] then you know what when when somebody
[1:15:05] gets sick when you know when
[1:15:08] we should we shouldn't ever never get to
[1:15:11] the place where you know we we think
[1:15:12] that you know somebody comes up here for
[1:15:14] prayer
[1:15:16] well I don't know if the Lord's going to
[1:15:18] do it or not
[1:15:19] no we we should when you come up here
[1:15:21] for prayer if you or if you speak the
[1:15:23] word
[1:15:25] then you know what then you when you
[1:15:27] speak the word then you know what then
[1:15:28] you believe that God's going to do it
[1:15:29] why because God said if you would
[1:15:31] believe and speak
[1:15:33] if you say
[1:15:35] to this mountain if you confess
[1:15:38] hold on I'm confessing what he's saying
[1:15:41] and he's the one that's got to back it
[1:15:42] up not me
[1:15:45] I don't have to do anything but believe
[1:15:49] and that's reason he said God honors
[1:15:50] Believers he's got to honor their faith
[1:15:53] why because they got their faith in and
[1:15:55] that's what they believe
[1:15:56] and they walk in it
[1:16:01] said you know what then I can I can
[1:16:03] claim my children I can claim my family
[1:16:06] why because it's the promise of God to
[1:16:09] me
[1:16:11] then you know what I've got to have
[1:16:13] faith no matter what comes what it looks
[1:16:14] like no matter how many years whatever
[1:16:17] comes or goes that doesn't matter God
[1:16:19] made the promise
[1:16:22] yes and whether whether you get sick and
[1:16:24] it just can continues to get worse or
[1:16:27] whatever that doesn't mean anything
[1:16:32] I tell everybody all the time that I
[1:16:34] think about when when brother Dick had
[1:16:36] cancer
[1:16:39] and brother brother Dick had that you
[1:16:41] know had that prostate cancer you know I
[1:16:43] just got so burdened one time and I was
[1:16:46] riding in the truck and I know y'all
[1:16:47] heard it many times but I was just
[1:16:48] riding in the truck that day and I'll
[1:16:50] never forget when I was riding in that
[1:16:52] truck
[1:16:54] and I began to pray over brother dick
[1:16:56] and the situation it's just like I
[1:16:58] couldn't get away from it
[1:17:02] and I'll never forget the day I was
[1:17:04] riding in the truck and the Lord came in
[1:17:06] there and he spoke to me and he said
[1:17:07] Lazarus was dead four days
[1:17:10] and he said brother dick's not as far as
[1:17:11] Lazarus was
[1:17:16] right and when I when I got that when I
[1:17:18] when I got that Revelation then you know
[1:17:20] what it just changed the whole thing
[1:17:21] because you know what I began to praise
[1:17:23] God for what he had done
[1:17:25] damn it for Friday
[1:17:28] why because it's a finished work
[1:17:31] it's not it's not something because you
[1:17:33] know that's what we got to have
[1:17:34] confidence in that's what we got to have
[1:17:35] faith in it's a finished work of calvary
[1:17:39] right that's the reason many times when
[1:17:41] I pray that's why I thank God why
[1:17:42] because when I pray over somebody and I
[1:17:45] say you know because by his stripes we
[1:17:47] are healed and you know what it's a
[1:17:48] finished work of calvary then if then if
[1:17:51] you have a need they know it's already
[1:17:53] finished before you ask then you don't
[1:17:56] have to struggle and plead over it why
[1:17:58] because it's already finished
[1:18:00] then all you got to do is claim your
[1:18:02] god-given rights
[1:18:08] that we don't have to we don't have to
[1:18:10] back up from the Devil
[1:18:13] the devil likes to give you a hard time
[1:18:15] and people you know well I don't know I
[1:18:17] don't know no
[1:18:19] sometimes sometimes it's time for us to
[1:18:21] raise up like shamgar go get what
[1:18:23] belongs to us and run the devil off
[1:18:28] that's what God wants us to do
[1:18:32] and if you have whatever you have need
[1:18:34] of
[1:18:36] so well Lord I don't I don't understand
[1:18:38] it's like well Lord I've read these
[1:18:41] books and I've read this and I don't
[1:18:42] understand this and I don't understand
[1:18:43] that then you know what you just put it
[1:18:45] before God and see if God don't come on
[1:18:47] the scene and show you what the
[1:18:49] scripture says
[1:18:52] because you know what brother I've said
[1:18:54] that he's no respecter of persons
[1:18:58] he don't respect one person over another
[1:19:00] because you know what if you desire
[1:19:02] these things and you put yourself before
[1:19:04] God and you seek God for these things
[1:19:06] then see if he don't open it up to you
[1:19:09] if he don't reveal to you what you're
[1:19:12] looking for
[1:19:16] because so many how many times can you
[1:19:18] say things in your life that you've seen
[1:19:19] God come on the scene and do
[1:19:21] Supernatural things
[1:19:25] and you don't know how it happened it
[1:19:27] only was God
[1:19:32] that was years ago I was working in a
[1:19:33] manufacturing plant
[1:19:35] and we were we were using robots to weld
[1:19:38] all these parts and we had jigs of hell
[1:19:39] and everything
[1:19:42] and we had these racks and they were
[1:19:44] probably near as tall as this ceiling
[1:19:45] and they were have to have racks were
[1:19:48] probably covered half of this room right
[1:19:50] here
[1:19:51] and it was just racks all these jigs in
[1:19:54] there
[1:19:55] we were looking for one jig so we get
[1:19:57] done so we go home
[1:20:00] and everybody's out there looking for
[1:20:01] that one jig and they can't find it
[1:20:04] and I didn't even know what I was
[1:20:05] looking for
[1:20:06] they just give me a part number and said
[1:20:08] go look for it and they'd already been
[1:20:10] out there looking and everybody scoured
[1:20:12] all of them people have been there for
[1:20:13] years and knew what they were looking
[1:20:14] for
[1:20:15] I didn't know what I was looking for
[1:20:17] but I had a number
[1:20:20] did I tell you I didn't know what I was
[1:20:21] looking for
[1:20:24] and I sat there and all these people all
[1:20:26] over the place looking trying to find
[1:20:28] that even looking at other places it
[1:20:29] wasn't even in the racks
[1:20:30] trying to find that one jig
[1:20:34] and I stood away and I was looking back
[1:20:37] over all those Jigs and I was standing
[1:20:39] there they began to pray
[1:20:41] and I said Lord do you know where that
[1:20:43] is I don't
[1:20:48] and Justice sure as I'm standing right
[1:20:50] here the Lord showed me and told me what
[1:20:52] direction to go I walked right up
[1:20:56] climbed up on the top and right in the
[1:20:59] middle that top of that rack was sitting
[1:21:01] right there and people had already
[1:21:02] looked for it and didn't see it
[1:21:05] and I reached up there and I picked it
[1:21:07] up and the guy come over and I handed it
[1:21:08] to him and said that's what we're
[1:21:09] looking for
[1:21:13] why because today they put their trust
[1:21:17] in him because if you are a son of God
[1:21:19] then you're led by the spirit of God
[1:21:21] then God can lead you
[1:21:25] when I went to Brother James tidwell's
[1:21:27] Church many years ago the old truck that
[1:21:29] Richard has behind his house
[1:21:33] Richard now and daddy worked on that
[1:21:35] thing well that thing never would work
[1:21:36] it we had we had ignition problems
[1:21:38] brother Donnie that thing wouldn't work
[1:21:39] we've done everything rewired it we
[1:21:42] bought new parts we done everything
[1:21:45] and it's like I don't know it was a
[1:21:48] devil in that truck and we couldn't get
[1:21:50] him out
[1:21:52] that thing was the most aggravating this
[1:21:54] thing that day
[1:21:57] I I was preaching brother James
[1:21:58] sidwell's Church that night and brother
[1:22:00] Michael his son come pick me up bring me
[1:22:02] Church
[1:22:03] because I didn't have a way so he kind
[1:22:06] of got me and I was riding in the truck
[1:22:08] to church and nothing and that's all I
[1:22:09] think about that truck oh
[1:22:11] aggravating this thing
[1:22:13] that night I got to preaching I was
[1:22:15] preaching on faith
[1:22:19] we have not because we asked not
[1:22:25] we get our minds on our problems and not
[1:22:26] have our minds on God
[1:22:33] and I'll never forget
[1:22:37] I got behind I was preaching behind the
[1:22:39] department that night and I said I got
[1:22:41] faith to believe I can go home put the
[1:22:43] key in that truck it'll crank
[1:22:46] my brother Michael's dropped me off I
[1:22:48] went behind the house and cranked that
[1:22:49] truck
[1:22:50] what would you do I said I put the king
[1:22:54] in and cranked
[1:22:57] why because God had why because he got
[1:22:59] faith and God knows that God's a
[1:23:00] mechanic
[1:23:03] sometimes he's the best mechanic he'll
[1:23:05] ever have
[1:23:06] man but it's just simple time like faith
[1:23:11] and we just trust God and walk by faith
[1:23:15] no matter what the circumstances looks
[1:23:18] like
[1:23:21] and you know what it's God's good
[1:23:23] pleasure to do that for you
[1:23:27] can you imagine that the God of all
[1:23:30] creation desires to give it to you more
[1:23:32] than you want it
[1:23:35] can you imagine
[1:23:38] foreign
[1:23:40] sometimes we we get in our minds whether
[1:23:42] we're worthy enough or not
[1:23:45] and God tries to tell us it's ours
[1:23:51] I just want to apologize and say Lord
[1:23:54] Lord help my unbelief
[1:23:57] Lord forgive me for my unbelief
[1:24:01] wait you've done so much for me
[1:24:04] and I don't have and I don't have
[1:24:06] confidence in what you've told me
[1:24:10] Lord forgive me for that
[1:24:15] because you know in the morning you know
[1:24:17] we don't know what kind of problems
[1:24:18] we're going to have but you know what
[1:24:20] he's gonna he's gonna meet at your every
[1:24:22] need
[1:24:23] it may not come the way you want it to
[1:24:25] but I guarantee you he'll meet your
[1:24:27] every need
[1:24:30] and I pray I pray that whatever you
[1:24:32] whatever you ask for tonight let's all
[1:24:34] stand whatever you ask for not have the
[1:24:36] musicians come whatever you ask for
[1:24:38] tonight
[1:24:39] I believe the Lord will give it to you
[1:24:41] right
[1:24:43] you don't have you don't have to ask and
[1:24:46] pray and grovel
[1:24:49] I was talking to somebody the brother
[1:24:51] Mark was we was talking the other day
[1:24:53] and brother Mark was telling me
[1:24:55] he said I love when you was when he was
[1:24:57] preaching on a court case and
[1:24:59] and you were talking about how when you
[1:25:01] get to the place and you know what your
[1:25:03] position in the law is
[1:25:06] when you when you go in before court
[1:25:10] that you
[1:25:12] you know the law
[1:25:14] when you petition the court you're not
[1:25:17] having to grovel in front of front of
[1:25:19] the judge
[1:25:21] all you got to do is say the law says
[1:25:23] this
[1:25:24] and here's where I've met the
[1:25:26] requirements of the law
[1:25:28] and whatever whatever the situation is
[1:25:31] on this this belongs to me
[1:25:35] and the devil's a squatter
[1:25:38] and he's on my property
[1:25:41] and the law says that I can kick him off
[1:25:43] but now when I go before the judge
[1:25:46] that's all I got to do
[1:25:50] I show the judge this is the rules
[1:25:53] this is where I've met all the
[1:25:54] requirements
[1:25:55] now it's for the judge to act and
[1:25:59] enforce the law
[1:26:01] and that's the way it is with God
[1:26:03] if you he said if you've met the same
[1:26:06] requirements as somebody if he's already
[1:26:07] healed one person
[1:26:08] you make the same requirements he's got
[1:26:10] to heal you
[1:26:12] if he said he said if he would do this
[1:26:14] for you if it's in the word
[1:26:20] is that right
[1:26:22] I love it when when Richard said I
[1:26:24] didn't know I didn't know though I
[1:26:25] didn't know brother Adam said those
[1:26:27] virtues were a requirement
[1:26:31] well you know what if they're a
[1:26:32] requirement
[1:26:34] if God requires them then guess what God
[1:26:36] has made a way for you to receive them
[1:26:41] then you know what I don't I don't have
[1:26:43] to grovel over that
[1:26:45] because you know what God said they're
[1:26:47] mine if I want them
[1:26:50] if I'm a Child of God then you know what
[1:26:52] that's required then you know what God's
[1:26:54] made a way for me to receive them
[1:26:58] then that's all it takes
[1:27:00] whatever I have whatever God has for us
[1:27:03] then we can receive it whatever we have
[1:27:06] need of
[1:27:08] and just say thank the Lord thank you
[1:27:10] Lord I'll I'm going to receive what
[1:27:12] belongs to me
[1:27:15] and just and just believe that
[1:27:19] and you know that I and it's whatever
[1:27:22] you have made up then I want to believe
[1:27:23] with you
[1:27:25] not just you
[1:27:27] because you know what nobody nobody's
[1:27:29] you know lots of times some or sometimes
[1:27:31] you you'll feel like you're all by
[1:27:32] yourself
[1:27:34] but you know what you've got so many
[1:27:36] around you
[1:27:38] that believe with you
[1:27:42] that whatever you have need of them
[1:27:43] we're going to believe for the same
[1:27:45] thing that you believe for
[1:27:46] whether you have healing a financial
[1:27:48] situation
[1:27:50] a marital situation whatever it is your
[1:27:52] children whatever it is if you believe
[1:27:54] then you know what we're going to
[1:27:56] believe with you
[1:27:59] because if it's God's word for you to
[1:28:01] have it for you to be blessed then guess
[1:28:03] what we're going to believe the same
[1:28:04] thing
[1:28:07] because you know we we live so far below
[1:28:10] our privileges what God has privileged
[1:28:12] US to have
[1:28:14] and I want to I want to be a faithful
[1:28:16] witness to what God has given us
[1:28:19] I want to be I want to be an heir and I
