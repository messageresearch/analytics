========================================

have a tube or crystal that picks up these either ways and manifest them. So you see right in this building now is live actions of people in the air, live voices. They're here. We know it. They're absolutely the truth. And the only thing you do, they catch it on. I don't understand the mechanics of those things, but the science has invented. But we know that it proves to us that there is a fourth dimension. Now the fifth dimension he says uh now the fifth dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies and goes he goes to the fifth dimension. It's a kind of a well hor horrible dimension. He said in in the countdown he said if I would type it for you it's like trying to go to sleep and you're in can't be asleep and you're in in a nightmare. You hide his thing. You're screaming. You're just all that's the state of the wicked dead. He cannot go into the presence of God because he he is a sinner. He cannot return back to earth because his time is up and he's caught between the two things in the fifth dimensions. He's got a soul and he cannot go in the presence presence of God because it's not covered by the blood. He he's a sinner. He cannot wake himself up because his time is up on earth. So there he is in torment nightmare. Think of that now before you enter it at nightmare scream. Many of us had had nightmares. It's just because we're told because the two conscious are passing sub and first conscious and it catches between and that's the nightmare. And when a sinner dies, he's caught with his soul between earth and hell in a nightmare. There he stands. Have you ever had a dream? I had dreams before that, you know, like a nightmare or something and you try to wake up and you can't wake up and you scream. You thought you woke everybody up and it's not, you know, it's it's a horrible, you know. So, we all have dreams, I guess. A lot of people in the Bible have had dreams even just uh ordinary people uh when they had uh Jesus that had taught us all. Matthew 27:19 he said when he sat down the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou not nothing to do with a just man for I have suffered many things this day in that dream because of him that's pilot wife Matthew 120 but while he thought of these things. Behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary, thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. First Kings 3:5 in Gib Gibian the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said that's what I shall give thee that's when thou so asked for wisdom in Job 33:15 in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep fall upon men and slumberings upon the Hey, The message exploits our faith. Brother says that's when Billy Paul was in was hospitalized. He says said, "I remember not long ago when my boy struck a habit that he ought not to have had many young some boy young boys and kept telling him. God had warned him. He almost got killed." Then he showed me on one one night in a vision. He said, "Watch Billy. Watch Billy." And I seen him fall and just limb over limb over limb over limb going like that, falling to the ground. And I thought and I screamed, "Oh God, have mercy on my boy. It's the only boy I have. Lord, don't let him die like that." And he was going falling through space like that. And when I came to myself in the vision, I was standing in the room screaming. I thought, "Oh my, did I wake my wife up?" Look around. No. I thought, "Oh my." I got down and began to pray. Look, Brad said in front of me. I thought, "Oh my god, don't let my boy be killed like that." That's what I was talking about. When you have dreams, sometimes you can't try to wake up and you can't wake up. and the message souls that are in prison. program says this is a vision at age when the vision at age 14 when the hospital after being shot in a hunting accident after the vision struck me I was so weak I lost all that blood and I thought I was sinking into an endless eternity many of you have heard me tell this before sinking into endless eternity and then what a different it was from the vision I had here not long ago of being in glory with the people contrast Yes. But in this I was falling. I finally I screamed for my daddy. Of course, being just a kid, that's what I would do. I screamed for my daddy and my daddy wasn't there. I screamed for my mother. Somebody catch me. And there was no no mother there. I was just going. I screamed then to God. And there was no God there. There was nothing there. After a while, I heard the most mournful sound that I ever heard. It was the awfulest feeling that there's no way even a litter and burning fire away at present be a pleasure to the sight of what it was. Now those visions had never been wrong and it was just one of the most horrible feelings I ever had. I heard a voice and sounded like some kind of a haunted affair and when it was I looked coming at me it was women. Sorry. Why is that so funny? Sorry. And they had green stuff. Oh, look at you guys don't have it. So that's good. And they had green stuff. You could see their faces. They had green stuff on their eyes and their and and their eyes look like ran ran back like the women today. They paint their eyes ran back like that and just their eyes and their face. And they were going, "Oh, oh my." I screamed out, "Oh God, have mercy upon me. Have mercy. Oh God, where are you? If you only let me go back, I'll live. I promise you to be a good boy." Now that's the only thing I could say. Now God knows and at the day of judgment he will judge me for this statement. That's what I said. Lord God let me go back and I will promise you I will be a good boy. Oh what a feeling. Then in a moment's time I have come back to natural life. Now he went beyond the curtain of time. That's what brother said. He said I think I've been to both both places. He said and the voice this is uh beyond the curtain of time. He says the voice asked would you like to see just beyond the curtain? I answered it would help me so much. What happened? I cannot say whether I was in the body or whether it was a translation I do not know but it was unlike any vision I have ever had. I could see the place to which I was taken and I could see myself lying back there upon my bed. I said this is strange. There were great numbers of people and they came running to me crying. Our precious brother. First came young women apparently in the early 20s. And as they would embrace me, they said, "Our precious brother." Young men that brilliance of young manhood with eyes blistering like stars on a darkened night with teeth as white as pearls. Embraced me saying, "Our precious brother." Then I noticed that I too had become young again. And I looked at myself there and turned and looked back at my old bed lying on the body lying on the bed with my hands behind my head and I said I don't understand this. As I began to try to apprehend comprehend the place where I was, I began to realize that there was no yesterday and no tomorrow. There no one seemed to be get tired as a multitude of the most beautiful young women I ever seen threw their arms around me and I discovered there was only a great love that overwhelmed me and no physical attraction as in a human human behavior. I noticed these young women all wore their hair down to their waistline and their skirts went down to their feet. After this hope, my first wife hugged me and said, "My precious brother." Then another young woman hugged me and Pope turned and hugged the young woman. I said, "I don't understand this. This is something entirely different from our human love. I don't want to go back to their old body on the bed." And that voice spoke to me. This is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is perfect love. Nothing can enter here without it. Next, I was taken up and seated in a high place. All around me were great numbers of men and women in the bloom of their youth. They were crying with joy. My precious brother, you are so happy to see you here. I thought I'm not. He said, I'm not dreaming for I can see these people and I can see my body lying back there on the bed. The voice spoke to me. You know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people. I said, "Yes, I remember that in the scripture, but there are not this many randoms." The voice replied, "These are not random. They're your comforts, the ones you have led to the Lord. Some of these women you think are so young and beautiful or more than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord." No wonder they're crying out, "My precious brother." Then the multitude cried together, "If you hadn't gone forth for the gospel, we wouldn't be here." And I asked, "Oh, where is Jesus? I want to see him." The people reply, "He just a little higher." He goes to the sixth dimension and God's in the seventh dimension. Someday he'll come to you. You are sent as a leader. And when God comes, he will judge you according to his you teaching. I asked does Paul and Peter have to stand the judgment also? The answer said yes. I said I preached what they preached and I did not divert from it to one side or the other. When they baptized in the name of Jesus, I did too. Whe they taught the baptism of the Holy Spirit, I did too. Whatever they taught, I taught also. I like this way. He says, "I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place. There was no jealousy, no tiredness, no sickness, no old age, no death, only supreme beauty and joy." He said, "Whatever you do, lay aside everything until you get perfect love." Right? Get to where you can love everybody, even every enemy. Right? Uhoh. No matter if the plane is rocking, the lightning is flashing, or the guns of the enemy are upon you, these things do not matter. Get perfect. This is one of the visions he had. I started his church age. He says, "I remember Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was getting an awful mess. Then the denominator began swinging around here and I was sitting in the this building one day and I seen a vision. I seen a pretty little kitten and he was laying on a silk pillow and he was the cutest little fellow and walked over there and I'm afraid of a I'm afraid of a cat." And I went over and I began to rake him and he was going, "You know how they do? They make a funny noise, you know." And I was raking him and I said, "Pretty little kitten." And he said, "Just as fine as you know." And I looked over behind Phil. It said Pentecostal kitten. Well, I thought now isn't that strange. And I said, "This has got to be a vision." And something said as as long as you rake him his fur this way. All right. But now you want to see what he's made out of rake his rake his fur backwards. See what when I rake his fur back and his eyes stuck up green. And he was a monster standing there spitting at me as hard as he could. See just rake his fur back a little bit. Tell him his baptism is not father, son, and holy ghost. It's of the devil and the Catholic church. Watch what happens to him. See, it stirs up. It stirs them up. the message uh paradox said it was about 3:00 in the morning. I was supposed I had gotten up and I looked where in front of me and I was coming down to the to to Jordan looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine. I was coming down to Jordan and it seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to Jordan. Someone was singing it. And as I drew near the river, I looked back and seen which way I had come. And I was 2/3 of the way there to Jordan. And I looked across Jordan. I said, "Oh, praise God." Just on the other side is where all that promises lay. Every promise lays in the promised land. And then I came to myself and I thought, could I have possibly have could I have been that I was dreaming? It's night time. See, you see it. A vision is something that you see with your eyes open just like a dream. You're looking right at it and you're conscious that you're standing like here on a platform and you're you're standing here, but yet you look like you're in a dream. You can't explain it. There's no way to do it. See, it's God's words and God's ways are unexplainable. They have to be accepted by faith. Joe, excuse me. What book was that in that quote? This one? Yeah. Paradox. No, I mean what the title of the message? Paradise. What book is it in? Paradox. Oh, Paradox. Okay. You like that? I didn't Ryan was asking questions at the last last Saturday on the the Bible study about the bumper blood. Jehovah Jar. We said the blood of Jesus is a bumper to sin. He said, "I went up I went up walked down the road a little piece and went to in an ordinary little restaurant like road place and and when I walked in behind the door, the door shut behind me real hard and I looked and there stood a policeman with his arms around a woman playing a slot machine. Gambling is illegal in Ohio. And I thought the law, the very law, and the man was my age, perhaps married and had a family at home. I thought, "Oh my corruption, filth." I looked back at the table back there and some young boys and a lady, little young lady about 18, 20, 20 years old. They ought to have been in school, Sunday school somewhere. those boys drinking back there and all the way they were abusing that girl and her standing there letting them do it. And I happened and I happened to look over to my right and there was an ear elderly woman sitting there with little clothes on that she ought to have had on. Real old about 65, maybe better. And she had purple makeup on her mouth and on her toenails and her arms. Poor old thing was flabbing. Her hair was boys lobbed in little kinky curls up on it. She was trying to light a cigarette drunk and two drunken men with her. And I thought, "Oh god, how can you let How can you look at such as that?" I thought my little Sarah and her back are going to have to be raised up in a world like that. He said, "God, why don't you just destroy the thing? Take it all out. I don't see how you can stand it to look at as such a thing as that. I was standing there criticizing her. The two drunks with her got up and went out to to be gone just for a while. And just then I felt something moving on me and I went back and sat down at the little booth to the side. Nobody paid any attention to me yet. It was kind of dark in the corner and there God gave me a vision and changed my mind uh of things. I looked there and I saw a world and around the world was u what looked like a red streak just to spray something said this is the blood of the Lord Jesus would die to save sinners that's a reason that God can't destroy he can't see her he can't every mortal being has a right and has a right to accept their salvation until they die and go beyond that blood they don't have to stand in judgment. They already judged. The day you eat thereof, that day you die. But as long as you're here, you got a right to the tree of life if you accept it. Then I looked and above it. There stood the Lord Jesus in a vision. And I seen him with his thorns on his head and blood running down his face and a big mockery spit over his precious beard. And he was jerking his head like that. every once in a while jumping at that I thought what is that what is that my lord and he said that's your sins and I seen that the blood of Jesus to my own sins was acting like a bumper if it would went beyond that stream of blood that was around the earth when he died to to settle the sins sins question if Putin went beyond that then God would have killed me. But just like the bumper to the car to keep your car from being hurt, the bumper catches the lick and the blood of that Jesus catches your sins. He said, "Father, forgive me. They don't know what they're doing. Father, forgive them." And I looked there, there my name laying there in an old book written like all kinds of things condemned. I crawled up to the his feet and said, "Lord Jesus, will you forgive me then? I didn't mean. I said, "You mean my sins hurt you like that?" He said, "Yes." He took his hand and dipped it in his side, took his finger and wrote across the book, "Pardon." Put it back behind him like that. Put his arms together and looked at me. He said, "I forgive you, didn't I?" I said, "Yes, Lord. I love you for it." He said, "But what are you condemning her?" Then you're willing to condemn someone else, but you look you was condemned once yourself and freely he pardon you. That changed my motive. Soon as I got in the vision, I walked over there to her and I said, "Madam, could I talk to you for a minute?" She said, "Oh, I have company." I said, "I don't mean it that way, lady. I'm a minister of the gospel. I want to talk to you." She took her cigarette down. She said, "Yes, sir." And I said, "Why are you living like this?" I said, "I don't really enjoy this. Are you a mother?" She said, "Yes, sir." And she gave me her story and it was heartbroken story, a picture of life other side, disappointment, same thing. She said, "Sir, I was raised a Christian. I was raised in a Christian home." I told her what the Lord Jesus rebuke me for condemning her and I wanted her to blow up or something like that. I said lady I want to ask you will you forgive me for having such thoughts about you? She said certainly son. She said will you pray for me that I will be saved? I said I will. Will you kneel down here? She said I will. We turned that place into a prayer meeting. That's right. The woman got saved, God. See, God will provide. One, he God will provide. He has already provided a way of escape for every one of us. I thought that was good. Yeah. Like I said, when I when I was a kid, we used to we grew up watching Frankenstein and werewolf and Dracula and uh Frankenstein didn't bother him. Just big old guy knocking stuff off and werewolves just wear all that get all that hair on him. But Dracula, I used to have nightmares and I told my mom, "If I ever die and you bury me, put a cross on on the coffin." You know, I used to really be scared of it. That's why when when go brother way and then late at night they want to eat steaks. I tell them no, I can't I can't eat steaks cuz I have a truck that try to bite me at night. But then then when I grew up, I did the same thing. You know, uh kids used to come in on on Halloween and I used to dress up at Dra as Dracula and then chase the kids down the street. So, I guess I should talk. Okay. I'm going to be a nice guy. Make sure you guys cover that. I was going to cover uh Joseph, but Joseph Joseph was uh he was the biggest dreamer in the Bible. There'd be a whole uh Sunday school class just on that. So, Timothy and I were were studying on that. We went to the to the camp when they took the kids to the camp. So, we really had good time. So, There's a lot of stuff in there.
