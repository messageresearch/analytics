whole church in 1971 so thank the Lord for each one use your talent for the glory of God and out for the world amen you got your Bibles let's go ahead and get started on the 6l part 6 today we're gonna talk about the tribulation just for a moment before we begin with the with the other part we're anticipating a good time in the Philippines desire you prayers thank you for some of you for giving us a little extra to to go with we appreciate that we're gonna be two weeks out with no salary and I bail Jill and I were talking the other day I'll just share this with you because even if even if brother Dale guilts or anybody gives $1,000 to a preacher on the weekend you think what's a lot of money I wish that I made that much by the time you pay your plane ticket your food putting your car at the airport taxes you would let down to about $600 maybe maybe 600 bucks so it's not all on the surface is nothing you know that you're taking some because you'd have to eat you have to live and and they got a couple of motel rooms for me to stay in but I told them I stayed with the people I like staying with the people I I've been to Jamaica 11 times and I don't think we've ever stayed in a motel if we ever you've never stayed in a motel the whole 11 times I've been over there I haven't I know Berlinale gente neither we stay I like stay with the people as long as they're comfortable with that you know I mean if they're not comfortable with that that's okay but as long as we're comfortable with it I'd rather I think Apostle Paul live with the people you know they live with when he went to a place he he stayed with the people because you get to know the people better you know you get to know the people well and and get to interact with them and and man you know it's like brother branham said when he walked in that colored lady's home over there and or wasn't miss somewhere in Mississippi or Memphis he said I've been in castles he said but that woman he said that woman he said you thought about feeling the presence of God so it really doesn't matter if it's a row house or our castle or doesn't matter to me as long as the people are Christians and Christians as opposed to act different anyway so they're not gonna treat you wrong but but just pray for us we're leaving Thursday but we'll we'll have a service Wednesday night to kind of give you a little idea what's what we're gonna do while we're over there we'll have a real tight itinerary last time I went you know went for three weeks and they gave me a couple days in between didn't rest and relax and not this time we're gonna hit the ground running and I think they might be one day that we're not gonna have anything to do so we're going to be flying to to the island of Palawan for three days and we'll have a big ministers meeting there and bring all the ministers in and it's best to do that that way you can't go over there three days on an island and try to preach it every place but if you can bring all 30 or so preachers to one spot and have ministers meeting they can maybe catch a revelation between each other and all of us being there and then they can go back and preach to their people because it's great to have an American it's great to have a foreigner and it's great to have a foreigner here but you know what it's not like sitting here and listening and every Sunday to brother Dale and some and the minister's preaching the Word of God you get more from that it's really nice and exciting to have somebody new but sometimes you say well what they preach and you say well I don't know so I hope you don't say that with me and brother Dale but I'm not gonna ask don't don't raise your hand let's go to the book of Revelation revelation 6 verse 12 yeah that's the tribulation okay all right let's bow our heads and get started les Nesta Lord to be with us today Lord Jesus we pray Lord that you would come among us today in a way Lord of Revelation of comfort to the people as we were meditating on this morning that Satan has got us a full of all these fears and anxieties and we're worried about this and worried about that that's what he wants you to do you want you to just worry but Lord Jesus you know you said wherever you went fear not and today I say fear not little flock because this the father's good pleasure for us to be in the exact place we're in right now and that's not fear about what's going to happen with Lord let's look to you the author and finisher of our faith you started the work and you're going to finish it father we pray that you'd be with us be with the sick among us be with the ones that are traveling Lord it's raining really hard now outside we pray that you just be with us on the highways take care of each one forgive us of our sins and bless us today Lord as we continue to open the word Lord and see the great and wonderful mighty things that you have for us Lord just be with the missionaries in the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father pray that you just specially bless the ones Lord that are there in the Philippines as we're heading in that direction Lord that you would just be with them Lord give them comfort bless them in Jesus name Amen and I beheld when opened the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and island was moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid himself in the dens and the rocks of the mountains I said to this to the mountain and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand you may be seeing the Lord as blessings reading the word we're going to just kind of be abbreviated today but I wanted us to see that this on our first quote and last Sunday I hope you enjoyed what we were trying to say they're kind of piggybacking on what brother Dale and then this morning also about what what he was saying on the on the feast days and all the treatment of the Jubilee and all those things because it does have something remember there and where is it in if somewhere in the Bible in the New Testament said all these things were given an example for an example because the Old Testament is an example we're not to live the life of Moses perfectly we'd have to kill an Egyptian we can't live the same life of Sampson from one end to the other because it was a womanizer see what I'm saying but God used them for certain pieces of things that we can see that we can use for examples to whom the end of the worlds come up on so it's just for you and I to look back into the Old Testament and not live just like Moses not live you ought to live like Christ Christ is one that's inside you helping you live it out the problem with Moses and some of those other ones in the Old Testament Christ wasn't living inside of them they were anointed by God to do the work they were supposed to do but they were not sons and daughters from God they are not sons and daughters of God and never will be sons and daughters are done you and I are sons and daughters of God amen so we have a idea we do have a special appointment in the morning we have a place that that not many people have we are able to do as we were talking in the Bible study last night we we have inside of us God and inside of us is God Almighty and in your flesh and that makes you a son and daughter of God it makes you God made manifest in another form called a bride he has him more feed into you to make you god almighty in human flesh that's what he said and then that's your part and these seals are not given down through the church ages these things were sealed up until right now until this day until this hour until this when you're sitting here today when we're sitting in service we are under the anointing of that headstone message the breaking of the seals and not just to break them because it was wonderful to break the seals when brother Branham was there working under one of the greatest anointing that ever worked under of course nobody got it but that was that was scripture being made manifest because the Bible in Revelations 5 the lamb took the book and open and broke the seals he had to break them but he had to break them through somebody he had to have a prophet on the earth to break the seals through but now is he the total only recipient of it you and I are the recipient of it you and I are the total recipient of it Jesus Christ did not die on the cross for himself he died for us brother Branham coming brought a message for us it wasn't for the people that were sitting there and the fulfillment wasn't for him it was for him to break the seal and then hand it to the people for the angel in revelations 5 to take that book and say John take this book and eat it he didn't take you from a seventh angel messenger hand he took you from the mighty angels hand amen not saying brother Brian didn't have anything to do with it but in the days of the voice of seventh angel when he shall sound the message will be made clear and then John and know what to do when he gets the book John knows they eat the book John says give me the book and he took it from the hand of the mighty angel he didn't take it from the seven angel messenger the seventh angel messenger was a messenger he brought a message and now you and I are the recipients of that message all right so we've got try our best to live by that part not that we're all going to be prophets we can't all be preachers but we all have our part and your parts just as important as anybody else's part the man brother Branham why why in the world did he just come here and just preach 1,100 some sermons and then he left the scene and then nothing happened God don't do that God never said I should have sent somebody else cause he would have been more clear no he sent the exact person that should have sent he said the exact words for us to hear so that somebody will get it amen so he sent brother Branham because of his character he give he eat he didn't protect brother Branham he protected the gift that was on brother Branham he protected that part because that gift was for me and you that's what this is this is my gift from God that was handed to me by seventh angel messenger he handed me this message and I'm talking about the verbal part the verbal part now Jordan jaw on top of the bride took the book from the mighty angel but who was the mighty angels my name's will come down through brother Branham and said here this is for you this is your book it's not my book is your book and mancubs it was a book of you it's not the book of you you're in the book without the names in this book it's just a ends and these and bites and then you read this Bible it you take all the names out and you've got nothing it's just gibberish really it is it's just a ends and these and buts and went here take your name out and try to read that you can't take take he take anything compared to a person if you just read it's hard to understand but when you put a person in there that's what you and I need to understand we need to understand that you are the person that God is talking about he's talking about you and to you in this Bible right here and then we come up here to the end time and you said well we're just we're nothing no we are we are it this is it this is nice thing about that this weekend and I'm gonna probably use it some over in the Philippines because like we always said it I don't want you to get caught in when I say who's gonna take a rapture you say I am it's not you the person you it's you the person you've become you become God made manifest in another form called the bride he said that and he's the one that's gonna take a rapture but it's true you you're going if you're if he's inside of you then who's gonna take a rapture I am alright so you go to the I am and I think I'm gonna maybe use that a little bit maybe maybe a little bit it's just the way the Lord's been leading I don't know if it's too strong formal wahby shouldn't be somebody's gonna have to say I come from God I'm going back to God amen we were talking about this morning down to Sunday school class you know Jesus stood there and he said I came from a certain place and Here I am now I'm going back to that certain place because I'm not going to be the son of man through the church ages anymore I'm going back to God I'm gonna come in the form of the Holy Ghost through seven Church ages but for a little while I got to come back and gather the harvest the son of man's the sword the seed the son of man sends the Reapers but the son of man standing there when the harvest is brought forth Boaz the type of Christ he was what he was a man he was a man that collected to harvest and that's what's going to do in the end time the son of man's got to come back and collect to harvest the human flesh all of us the son of man ministry are the headship of the word which the headship are these seals that we're talking about do you want to know what headship the headship that was lost down through the church ages it's what we're talking about right now we're talking about what was left off through all the other church ages tonight and today we're talking about exactly what God had in his mind he saw it and he saw people there that would take it so that's got to be me and you okay but there's a place that we're not going to go to we're not going to go through this - what we're talking about today we're going to talk about the Tribulation Period because the sixth seal opens for the Tribulation Period all right and you and I are not included I was looking up quotes the other day because remember most of your church people church denomination believe you're going to go through some form of tribulation whether it be three and a half years minor three and heavy earth major you're gonna go through seven years of tribulation they get that out of the Bible without revelation without revelation but now with revelation we know that even brother Branham the very analogy he used was that Joseph married a Gentile and then when he when he told the his brethren which were the Jews when he told them who he was he had already dismissed his Gentile bride into the palace and that's always been in the Bible but nobody but brother Branham was able to pull that out and say hey you don't go to any tribulation there's no tribulation for the bride I told you but the greatest revelation if I never get another one I know one thing for sure if I'm born again today I will not stand in the tribulation wrath of God and then I'm going in rapture amen then you should be happy about that too because around the world the denominations you put you send them down and say alright we're gonna go through the triple yeah we might go through the tribulation we got you know we got a lot of cleansing to do no you accept what God's already done Christ went to tribulation for us when he died on the cross I didn't bring the quote with me but brother Branham was using it in the sixth seal of how when Jesus died what happened earthquake son went down all these things happen almost parallel what happened to the sixth seal he said see there there's God delivering his son and all these things happen Moses when God delivered his children out of Israel that's what happened all these things to nature and then he said look here now you've got a 144,000 that's getting ready to be delivered and the same thing is going on but now what happens to me and you all was natural for Jesus that was natural for Moses in Egypt that's going to be natural for 144,000 you and I are going to get it spiritually our tribulation is right now thank God our tribulation is now we get a spiritual tribulation not a natural physical tribulation oh sure we might and I think what are y'all doing setting up here man okay good to see good see Tony an extra with us today on the fourth row I looked over I'd see him but sister Esther said she was asking about being physically bereft we were talking about that last night in the Bible study will you have to look up that word BER EFT which is a derivative of bereaved but bereft means to be something taken away from you that you're in other words air conditioning heating being physically bereft the Prophet said would mean that we're going to these things going to be comforts going to be taken away from us that we have now that we won't have then that's being physically bereft now I don't know I'm not gonna say this just to us death nobody but me I don't think we're going to be like the martyrs and be drug apart and because there's laws in courts and things that's even the horrible as the court system is you can at least plead your case here in in the United States you can plead your case over there in the dark ages they just said oh you're a you're a Christian you know put a put of oxen on one end of him and an oxen on the other end and pull them apart you know they didn't care there wasn't no they were the judge jury and executioner but with being physically bereft doesn't mean I don't think like you said we're not going to be putting stocks but I think we might have to miss a meal we might have to not be things that we can't get together is what we were talking about last night we might not be able to get together that's why that it's important to pack the word in now where you don't have to say wait a minute you pray to brother Dale the prays to brother brown the prays to God to get you something now that's Catholic that's what they get that's they're praying to somebody if we're praying somebody to get something you pray to God and God answers your prayer Bible says you say to this mountain be removed and let me be carnal you say to this porkchop land on my plate hey man hey man yeah I'm porkchop I ain't bad is it I could have said just a piece of bread but you know what though that's what's going to happen but you got to come to a place that God can work in your life because power without character satanic power that kind of power if you had that kind of power what would you do if you weren't really a true solid born-again believer there's a lot of things you could do that we're wrong and God would have to honor it because he did with Elijah Elisha was the prophet of God somebody made him ill and he called to she-bears to eat the foot now that wasn't God and that didn't have anything to do with God but God honored what the Prophet said all right so he's gonna honor what you say but power with character is fit to have that porkchop if you need it or have that piece of bread if you need it or have that brother Lewis like over and look at that you all around the world the brother needed oil in his car you saw all that's just so simple no that's God Donny will tell you there is no known case in the United States and around the world that a car has been out of oil and all of a sudden you put the dipstick back in and it's full would you think even if it was sitting way on the side you could say well this sitting way over here and it couldn't get no somebody will get to the dipstick but for it to be out and then all of a sudden be full brother Harris needed all needed gas one time and remember he run out of gas and he prayed that thing it filled it up with gas well who did Texaco it Havilland come by the Havilland man come by and put oil in that car no God Almighty sent an angel by with a can of oil poor nothing in there and it was done and it wasn't just a little heating you how many quarts to bring he knew what he wanted my to like car what truck was so he brought five quarts of all but you see what I meant that's power with character though it's did not ask for everything in the world but ask for that what you need of and that's what's going to happen to you and I I believe as we continue on I don't think we're going to be like I said now now when the tribulation when this tribulation starts they're gonna be hunted down like dogs brother branham said they'll be hunted and killed for what they believe because what's going to happen is you and I are still living under the Holy Ghost but you got to remember when we leave this place that's not just a minor tribulation that's the wrath of God that's going to be poured out it'll be a godless nation a godless group of people and almost a godless world except for the 144,000 and the foolish virgin that are trying to you know write the thing back up again but they're the ones that's going to get killed because why because they're under the tribulation they will have to go through that cleansing but when you and I get born again thank God Almighty in heaven you don't have to go to a tribulation we're going through it now we're going through it now you say well I yeah we're going through it now we've got $50,000 cars and $200,000 houses we're going through some real bad now what's going on between your head is your battleground Satan does not care how big your car is or how little your car is but if he can get in your mind he has won the battle so there's the problem is right here so that's the police oh what we got to do we got to feed it in the word so that it'll drive that out because look if you're born again you're not going to be driving unclean spirits out of your soul that's a clean spirit that's the Holy Ghost inside but that second person that second realm is what we're dealing with the spirit realm the memory reason conscience effects an imagination we're all that debt where the demons just travel back and forth and that's your true relation I told them I said look when we get a body change you're not gonna have to worry about praying praying is over you're not gonna worry about redemption redemption over for you not for the world now but for you Redemption is over we're not gonna go to heaven and be praying for people we do it now fervently pray for people pray the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much but if you aren't gonna need it in the future home it'll be done away with and I am NOT gonna get into where we're supposed to get now let's get back aaron sitting back there bless his heart i won't want to miss rabbit trail howl ooh you said so now let's go to the first quote i'm just glad that i don't have to go through the tribulation cuz lid let me say one more time you talk to Memphis Baptists and all the different ones they're looking for a tribulation to happen in their life and then get saved now that's not God the devil's telling them that but we know once we're boarding in the tribulation just slides away that's why brother Branham was talking about on the when he was wanting to preach on the seven trumpets seven trumpets are not to us the seven trumpets are to Israel which are the wolves and the vials and the plagues you and I don't see these plagues you and I don't see the hairy men and the scorpions and all that we don't see that we're gone we're in another dimension waiting on God to clean this thing off so that the new earth can come forth and we can come and live on it amen so the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period so as soon as we leave this place that's what takes place the bride's gone there's no living creatures nothing there to say God's not dealing with the church no more so we're gone he's dealing with Israel this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelations 11 remember Israel is a nation God's servant nation and when he was brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom ages were David the son of David sits on the throne so that's what that's what we've been talking about even when we jump through the tribulation period over into the Millennium that's still not to us we're just there on a honeymoon that's to a promise that David is going to set on the throne and there's going to be twelve tribes of Israel around it we read last night in Ezekiel 14 through 48 and all through there the Millennial temple has nothing to do with us we don't need a temple you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you are the temple of God and then you're the anointing to the temple they're going to build in the Millennium and you and I are going to live there okay so that even in the Millennium we've we really don't have to do anything once we take a body change and step over another dimension brothers and sisters it's over it's over for us the strut actually the struggling should now start being over now you you you temporarily have a body change working right now inside of you that inside man is 20 years old encased by whatever age you are okay that's a paradox but once that inside man takes over and you let him take over then everything's gonna be done everything's gonna be finished hey man you say why it's too simple well that's just what if it's not anything we don't have to we don't have to go through tribulation we don't have to listen to to prophets we don't have to be hunted down like dogs we don't have to be worried about a nuclear bomb falling on us we're not gonna worry about an earthquake where it swallows up everybody we're not going to worry about that see to me that worry is good enough right now for me just to not worry about that sure than you you know you worry about your kids getting in before the for the door shuts and you worry about this that's okay but do not worry about you if you're sealed in now you need to worry about if you're not but if you have the new birth you're sealed in to the day of your redemption amen cozy look even in these seven seals we must see and we'll get to this when we get back from the Philippines we'll start with this this is the seal part but if if Israel gets is born again into the tribulation or in the 144,000 get received a new birth in that tribulation burst them and then you've got Jesus with this tribulation natural Moses with his might and yours has to be a spiritual revelation it has to be a spiritual tribulation we're all nature our nature listen our nature is when we're born we're dead everybody in this building was born the exact same way it came from the exact same place by the exact same height and we're going to a place called the grave if we don't take a body change so that's your nature that's the nature we're all built with as we get as the young ones like you got two nice-looking show the camera two two nice-looking brothers right here yeah there you go - good you what they don't get up in the morning and go I'm done but when you get move over to this side of the church in this row when you move over here though brother Dale and brother Donny have a little bit different thought process than these two guys do basically early in the morning I mean listen you remember when you could you can sleep on concrete at this age concrete never move and get up and go bad I feel good let's go do it at about 59 doing it their age it take a crane with a moving crew to get them up off concrete but they just get up and go but seat so the mentality I like to keep telling sister Cletus she's oldest one in the building she's older in the building she's always win the building she is closer to her 20 year old and not than we are if you start thinking that way what is that that's a total disruption of the nature that you've been given because the nature you've been giving is I'm gonna live I'm gonna work I'm gonna have kids I'm gonna die and that's probably about 100 percent correct all over the world there's no exception to that right but we've got to come to a 6-cell purging where that sanctification comes and it tells us that nature is not going to happen that nature has to be disrupted to where I'm not going toward a grave I'm going toward a change amen so that's what we're heading toward but we got to get this natural part out of the way all right let's go to number two well we know that the sixth seal is the judgment seal it's the judgment seal exactly what it is now see we've had an antic ox rights in the church go now finish goes up then we see the martyrs of the Jews back there under the altar here's the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgment will come forth 144,000 redeem Jews I'll prove that there's usually not Gentiles we know that and have nothing to do with the bride nothing at all for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word so see we get everybody has to come to a judgment everybody he said well you just said we were judged through Christ so he had to come to a judgment but even we have a judgement of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad we have the little things that we have to deal with because that fallen nature is so bad but when you take a body change folks brothers sisters look at me when you take a body change who can condemn me a sin who can convince me of sin I don't have no sin you should believe that now we have sins but we don't have the sin that's gonna take us to hell amen but even those sins will be done away with once we get a glorified body I mean what else are we doing what sure we may have to pass through a little bit of a judgment of we'd wronged our brother or something but nothing compared to what's happening on this earth nothing compared there will be nothing think of the think of the destruction and chaos that's gonna happen when we're out of here amen so now watch even Isaiah 13 verse 6 Isaiah says how you for the day of the Lord is at hand you shall come as a destruction from the Almighty there force y'all All Hands B Fane and every man's heart shall melt that's the sixth seal and they shall be afraid pains and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed at one another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate 6 sealed deals with the land Nature land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it where the stars of heaven in the constellations therefore shall not give their light the Sun shall be darkened in this going forth and the moon shall not cause her life to shine now that's we just read the sixth seal sixth seal verse thirteen started having fell into earth even as a fig tree casteth said and finally untimely fruits the heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together same thing here in Isaiah because remember Isaiah as a total commentary of the Bible alright for the stars of heaven in constellation there shall not give their light and the Sun shall be darkened that's going forth the moon shall not cause her light to shine and I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible words that write here verse fifteen and the kings of the earth and the great men the rich man chief captains mighty men every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne that arrogant group of people God's going to bring them down but this is all during the Tribulation Period all right now let's look at number three see they're just exactly as I saw the same thing that Jesus spoke of that the seventh seal reveals when he's cleansing the land with tribulations that's the Tribulation Period this sixth seal did you see what I just read you might catch that Isaiah saw the same thing that Jesus spoke up that the seventh seal reveals he didn't say it was the seventh seal he said what the seventh seal reveals there's your key the seventh seal reveals every seal without the seventh seal you don't get any of the seal when he's cleansing the land with tribulation that's the Tribulation Period this sixth seal yes he was a prophet and the Word of God was made known to him all right so now let's read number four because what's gonna bring in thin just for information because he stopped by the remnant now remember as his analogy was you and I are not the remnant you and I are the piece of cloth you and I are the suit or whatever God's made you and I are that but there is when you when you when you cut out the goods there's a remnant there's pieces leftover but it's the same garment it's just not used for what it's used for all right that's the same thing with the the foolish virgin because remember the foolish virgins gonna be given eternal life for what they believe in what they see and what they profess they're gonna be given eternal life you and I just accept that before all this and it precedes any of this alright so not what is a remnant the piece that's cut left some kind of same kind of goods is that right you go cut your dress out of calico and you spread out a big piece of calico and you cut it out it's your business where you lay the pattern in other words he's explaining where we're God puts a pattern this is business it's God business business where he lays the pattern he cuts her right out is that right and now this rest of this calico left here is just as good a calico as a dress it's right right but it's God's election god he lacks his church God predestinate says Church God for ordained that ordains his church and he takes that church out and the remnant is left to go through the tribulation period all right now look I know but remember this that remnant that's going to be foolish virgin is not the 144,000 these are brothers and sisters that have been blinded by false shepherds brother Branham said in one place it was I don't know if I got it in that one but he said it's the people we couldn't get to he was shaming us really is what he was doing he says the people we not getting to okay and that's where many Bible scholars today get mixed up thinking that the bride's over you're under in the tribulation fella said to me said I I couldn't tell you brother Branham say said I've seen the bride up in heaven the Dragons burnt and water out of his mouth to make war with the bride and the 144,000 which is the bride standing on Mount Sinai oh no no no no no brother Branson not me you got it all mixed up the brides in heaven now let me stop right here that's where brother Branham brings the quote in late before this where the bride leaves on Revelation 4:1 and doesn't come back to revelations 19 see it takes care of all of 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 8 all those chapters of tribulation time it's not to us we go up in for one after these things the door was opened in heaven says come up here there we go up into that open door but we get the spiritual part of every bit of it Amen why I said anything you talking about that tribulation anything we read about tribulation you can put it in your life that you be the went through or you're going through amen earthquake you have our acquaintance your house you kids never got mad at you call you a little kid a tornado why hello cyclone hurricane or Deana and OH see what I mean the ends in trouble she's outside but that's the parts you got you're going through now we're going through tribulation now we don't have to go through any of this natural stuff and the remnant of a woman's seed the bride isn't and the remnant of the woman's seed not her not the pattern the remnant was there and the persecution the Roman Empire when Catholicism will consolidate and they'll you not their powers together with the great Church it's like brother Joe Canada was talking about last night brother Graham told us over and over again do not worry about communism and all these other isms he said you worry about Romanism Romanism is the purple curtain is what's going to come down against us is that that's the policy I mean communism that's not gonna bother us but it's just what what bothers you most think about in your brain what bothers you most is it natural things or spiritual thing if you're born again spiritual things because you always got something in your head that's pounding for and against and what is this and what is that and right see there you still know it's builds up come on people please bill just means you can't handle your finances or the non-payment of them but spiritual things is what's gonna either follow with you or are you gonna get rid of them what drives you crazy brother branham many times he never hardly ever said anything about finances ring he would always say you got a spiritual problem even when the women were going through menopause and all these things he's you got a spiritual problem you've got things that make you nervous you got things to make well where is that that's on the inside that's not over here over here over here over here it's right here it's inside we're carrying these things with us we need to get rid of them because you know what it's just going to be a my new detail of what they're gonna go through naturally when we leave here amen so let's go to quote number five and then we're gonna read revelation and then we'll be finished vii says is on the seventh seal now 1963 now we're at the end of the eagle let me come over here I'm sorry just huh now we're at the end of the eagle the revelation to be revealed the whole thing now compared this with revelations the tenth chapter verse one through seven we'll see here in this revelation here ten one through seven that in the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message was to finish up all the mysteries of God now we find out now what's this now we find out also in that is now we find out also in this that the sixth seal now being opened it was for a three-fold purpose alright and we'll cover this and then we'll cover back your three-hour threefold purpose when I come back from the Philippines because there's a three-fold purpose of the sixth seal there's a three-fold purpose of the seventh seal all right there by okay with that saying man wake up thank you now here was the purpose the first thing now the sixth seal is judgment seal tribulation seal and what's happening there's judgment being passed on a group of people in the earth right there's three folds to this now here was the purpose the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification that was a revelation under the sixth seal cuz there's a revelation under the seventh seal that you and I are already in heaven it was a revelation in the first seal that we were heading that way but look after the fourth seal were gone for sale were gone there's nothing mentioned of us we're not even here all right the first thing was that the sleeping version had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over in revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter here that she had been purged and she had been given her robe now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that don't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way they were blinded by these false prophets and they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart so that we were talking about last night listen don't knows your heart we were talking about the message to the 144,000 last night it's only going to be I'm sorry the fifth seals you the fifth seal Jew is not going to be some bank robbing whoremongering Jew no it's going to be somebody that God knows their heart God knew David's heart God newly inside of David and what he would do if he had the Holy Ghost and what he do if he wouldn't same way with the fifth seal Jew it's nothing to be ever scoundrel this a Jew it's going to be somebody that lives as close to jewelry jewelry not jewelry jewelry that they can like the pure Orthodox Jew the ones that live it that really try those are the ones that's going to be the fifth field you those are the ones he blinded he didn't blind Barabbas Barabbas was a murderer everybody got that so it's not every everybody in the it's not going to be included in the fifth seals God's not going to just what you think well that's great yeah it is great but it's great to those that God knew that would wound it that okay and man cuz God knows the heart the same way with this he knows that fifth I mean he knows that foolish virgins heart that if somebody would have got to that person and preached him the right message he or she would have got mourning in all right yes they were sincere and heart and God knows their heart and hear their purge during this time you notice that another purging time that this is the second fold that's for Israel when she gathers that's the second fold God purges Israel in the Tribulation Period out of the millions that gather there there'll be a select 144,000 and they will be purged also remember they got to be killed God's purging Israel notice this is number three notice here is a whole earth is to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon stars in all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium alright the millennium is coming up and see everything that's got any felt on it is to be purged during the sixth seal so now when I get back we're going to heading toward you're purging you're going through a sick seal purging whether you like it or not you're gonna go through it cuz you're a child of God amen but you're not going through the natural amen you're not going through the natural all right let's read revelations 20 then we'll be done and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the keys of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nation's No More till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them now this is coming up I'm moving forward just a little bit here because when I see Thrones that's you and me that's going toward the white throne judgment that's what that is and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them they and judgment was given unto them who's gonna judge the earth the Saints will judge the earth so it's me and you all right and I saw the souls of them will be headed for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshipped the Beast neither His image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years those are the only ones that's gonna live in the reign of Christ for a thousand years that kind of people because what but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished see the foolish virgin that's going to be killed in the Tribulation Period are not going to come up there's no resurrection for them to come up in except the second resurrection they missed the first one so they got to come up in the second resurrection so as they die they've got to stay not dead but they gotta stand another dimension until the end of the end of the thousand years for their purification alright and shall reign with him a thousand years and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of this prison and shall go out to deceive the nations within the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together in the Bible the number whom is as the sand of the sea and they would upon the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about in the beloved city and fire came from God out of heaven and devoured them and the devil that deceived him were cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever we know that's not eternity that's gonna be for a length of time and they're gonna go away and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead here's what one worm was stopped here and I saw the dead small and great stand before God that's not us that's not us that's the people that just came up in the second resurrection that's the foolish virgin that's the cup of water in my name that's one's giving eternal life for being good to you because watch I am NOT ever gonna be judged now that I'm born again you'll never be judged by your own works you were judged by what Christ did this is not and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the book according to their works not his works according to their works why because they had to go through a tribulation period they had to they had to be written in the book that they gave their life for the gospel that they held the gospel they knew right but not you and I you and I repeat the first part worse as I saw Thrones that's us that's us sitting at the white throne judgment judging the whole world but this seat seal comes up and brings a three-fold manner number one foolish virgin got to go through tribulation to give their life for the gospel that they hold the second fold is Israel 144,000 is going to come up out of that tribulation and be given eternal life the third fold is going to be this earth is going to be purged so that because remember Christ doesn't come back till the Millennium you and I don't come back to the Millennium I mean we only got glorified body around here just for a little while then we go over into another dimension to the marriage supper and then we come back Israel are the whoever you want to say 144,000 they're building the temple and all these things and you and I come in in the end of the millennium oh no not a redeemed entire member brother branham I want to tell you this one one thing read in the future home the Millennium in the future homes some things you can intertwine but then when you come to the future home it being eternal in the Millennium being in time it's totally separate there will be things in the Millennium they'll be in the future home but they will be things that happened in the Millennium that won't ever happen in the future home because during the Millennium you're still in that seventh day of time amen you're still in that seven seven is forty-nine you're still in that loop now we're not we already got our Jubilee s what brother that's right we're in our Jubilee now we've already accepted the fifty if you've went to Pentecost you have accepted your 50th Jubilee you're just waiting for your land to go free amen everything else is gone free you just waiting on the land to go free amen but the earth is still going through the seven sevens is 49 remembered there's no way Jesus could raised on Saturday because he didn't raised in the church age didn't raised in the Old Testament he raised on the eighth day which is the first day of the week he raised out of the church ages he raised out of the Old Testament he raised out of the seven sevens is 49 how in the world can you put God in a 49 he's a fifty he's a eighth day so that's why he had to raise on the first day of the week he had to raise out of that seventh day couldn't raised on the seventh day he had to raise on the eighth day which is being the first day of the week and when you get born again guess what that jubilee comes to you if Christ is in that Jew he is the Jubilee but he stepped into the Jubilee when he come out of that tomb he stepped right into the Jubilee because his his land has been resting waiting on us for 2,000 years he just didn't have no heartaches and trials when he stepped out of the tomb he said all power and heaven earth been given unto me I don't have to sleep anymore I don't have to eat less I won't - I don't need a wall I don't even need a door I'm not gonna ever be asleep on a boat again God's not I'm never gonna have to be put on the cross and have nailed foot in my hand I'm never gonna have to first I've done he was in the 8th day he had stepped out of that tomb right straight into eternity you did the same thing the day you accepted the new birth in your soul you entered into that eighth day you were raised he was the first fruit of the resurrection cuz you and I are what we're already raised in in heavenly places witnessed ain't believed it yet but you got to believe it and with this I believe with the sixth seal purging I believe you can because when it purges everything low when it purges everything who steps on the same God steps on the same when everything is purged remember he can't step down here in a physical form until the Millennium but that is when that's the purging of the knee and you hear me and you get purged under the sixth seal spiritual purging but the natural threefold purging of the sixth seal is the Phylis virgin 144,000 and the earth once those three things are done then who steps out Christ when you get finished with justification and sanctification of Baptism the whole goes who steps on the scene Christ Christ in human flesh mmm in a group called a bride it's been given to me in you we just got to do it hey man you love Lord let's stand our feet no we need that no just leave it there if anybody has the need we're gonna sing open the eyes of our heart just one time and if you have a need then we'll sit back down and finish what we're gonna finish won't take bit about 30 minutes
