[0:05] [Music]
[0:19] alright tell let's not worry about that
[0:22] I want worried about the sun's on dark
[0:26] not worried
[0:28] I think even enough to look at you for
[0:30] nothing one I am now in Revelation
[0:34] chapter since last Sunday we were
[0:38] talking on the plague field we're still
[0:40] on the sixth seal let's read this and
[0:43] then we'll get in to read another
[0:46] scripture about how this unfold and to
[0:51] go back just a minute remember that that
[0:54] we as the bride of Jesus Christ his
[0:56] Gentile bride gone at this moment okay
[0:59] she's gone she's out of here she then
[1:02] he's being glory she's in the wedding
[1:04] supper she's in wherever we are and
[1:06] that's okay I'm not worried about that
[1:08] as long as we make the rafter and lonely
[1:11] take a body chain and make a rapture
[1:13] whatever goes on this earth is of no
[1:16] concern to us at that moment now it is
[1:19] now because we watch for the sign but
[1:22] we're not signed seekers are signed
[1:26] followers because remember signs follow
[1:28] the believers whatever we're believing
[1:30] that sign is going to follow us anything
[1:33] that goes on and I don't discount what's
[1:35] going on in the star guy Ryan I did that
[1:38] this morning I looked at that September
[1:39] the 23rd you heard about that September
[1:41] 23rd 2017 virgo is in line with
[1:45] something and Leo the line is on top of
[1:48] her head and there's 12 stars lined up
[1:50] well they go back to Revelation 20 the
[1:52] court says there's 12 stars over
[1:54] the end of the of the one and say that
[1:56] the Rapids with a play September 23rd
[1:58] which is okay will mean but they missed
[2:02] a few key points you see that's what we
[2:04] have a profit come and tell us the
[2:06] little vivvy points of things that has
[2:08] transpired in the Word of God before
[2:12] that happens so I'm not worried if it
[2:15] happens in that just be ready to be
[2:19] ready them be ready because remember I
[2:22] was saying about this other day you know
[2:24] you got five wise virgins in there five
[2:25] foolish burden now remember the five
[2:28] foolish virgins look up the five wise
[2:33] virgins remember the Bible says they
[2:35] came looking and said give us of your
[2:38] oil things you were to go then you were
[2:41] to go to get the oil again alright so
[2:44] remember they're lighted one out both
[2:47] says their light went out the lowest by
[2:50] a Buddhist verdict that we're virgins
[2:52] for against to the Word of God
[2:55] alright five wise bird and had oil in
[2:58] their lap the type of the Holy Ghost
[2:59] right alright so they know to come in a
[3:03] look where to look for that that's why
[3:05] you see a lot of people now I call it
[3:08] jockey em they're they're the Baptist's
[3:10] or you know they're they're tired of
[3:12] what's more linear denomination and the
[3:14] message this is tired what's going on
[3:15] their denomination is there now they got
[3:17] independent churches and now they got
[3:19] worship centers and now they got there
[3:20] they don't name it Baptists Methodists
[3:22] meanwhile because they're missing the
[3:24] piece they're missing a piece of the
[3:27] puzzle when witness when all the
[3:31] believers are taken away will there be
[3:35] anyone left enter the believer plus
[3:38] another path the foolish curve you will
[3:41] be left they are believers because all
[3:43] the believers the those that faith that
[3:46] all that are gone hoarding it don't what
[3:49] about them
[3:50] would be destroyed wheelchair that's
[3:52] right done mile road we're in another
[3:54] dimension we just step over the other
[3:55] dimension called heaven and we wait to
[3:57] say how's that we hung back okay now but
[4:02] we've got happening this is actually
[4:04] going on we can't discount this
[4:06] something to happen so something's going
[4:08] to happen all the way to the new city
[4:10] comes down to Revelation what is it 22
[4:12] the new city comes down there's things
[4:14] going on right that we need to look at
[4:19] while we're here because what this does
[4:21] then to me that's why I see that the
[4:24] seven sealed book is a book of
[4:26] redemption so there must be something my
[4:28] brother they was talking about that fell
[4:30] and has to be redeemed back to a
[4:33] position and if you listen to me this
[4:35] afternoon we'll kind of try to help a
[4:37] little bit more I saw something else
[4:39] Wednesday night while go to the old
[4:40] oppression that may help us a little bit
[4:43] more in the connection between the
[4:45] Genesis 1:26 man and the two lives that
[4:48] we've been talking about but it should
[4:50] bring us into the lake or not a
[4:54] conclusion but a connection okay it's
[4:57] connect our way back because we got lost
[5:00] what do you mean by lost what's lost
[5:01] Locke means you don't know where you at
[5:03] a lot of it you don't know where you go
[5:05] until somebody comes up and says hey I
[5:08] know you're lost I see that you're lost
[5:11] and I am the way the truth and the life
[5:14] so Jesus is going to have to come and
[5:16] show you and he will never show you
[5:18] wrong how in the world would a what a
[5:21] great God takes up wrong
[5:24] he's not false God and he's a true God
[5:27] the faithful and true witness alright
[5:30] not to be able was false but it has a
[5:32] true sound when you when you tune a
[5:34] piano it doesn't have a wrong sound but
[5:36] you get to a point where it's perfect
[5:37] has a true sound to it and when you hit
[5:40] that whatever that is it rings the same
[5:43] and that's what we're looking at our
[5:45] problem is is we give a little off-key
[5:47] we hit a lofty and we start ringing over
[5:50] this lamb because now this is the way
[5:52] this way so okay
[5:58] Johanna can you find the place okay oh
[6:02] that's a good thing right there
[6:04] yeah so the sealed and I want to bring
[6:08] something else to in a few weeks when I
[6:12] get back from Oklahoma brother jokes
[6:14] going to Sunday school next Sunday but
[6:15] I'll be an Oklahoma next that weekend so
[6:18] we'll even wins them are in we're going
[6:21] to Kansas for a couple days to be
[6:23] friends out there and we're going to
[6:24] brother closet until the next Tuesday so
[6:27] we'll be back church next week when you
[6:29] eat so but we're working on something
[6:33] that really I believe it will help us
[6:35] see where all this come together because
[6:37] I involved in the least allowed and talk
[6:42] to people they realize one thing's for
[6:44] sure
[6:44] then people have been either not talk or
[6:48] they not listen or they just don't
[6:53] listen
[6:54] that there's no hold understand because
[6:56] listen brother Brown said we are a what
[6:58] we are a prophetic people and it
[7:01] requires a study it doesn't require that
[7:05] you brain-dead Lee don't look that were
[7:09] to walk into Church and set that thing
[7:12] you got to use your human brain to
[7:15] filter some of this but you don't use
[7:16] your holy goat right
[7:17] but why problem is is we just go to
[7:19] church so it's automatic
[7:23] it's not all the man not trying to teach
[7:25] you something I told you if you want to
[7:27] work out of here he put it on the door
[7:28] says it has a lot of do clubs all make
[7:30] you here right all right so that's just
[7:35] that's the way I see it that's the way I
[7:37] need it I need this you know I I think
[7:41] stay out of Sunday I think stay out
[7:43] early 90 finally gone somewhere you know
[7:45] with me well and I do we go to church
[7:47] somewhere yeah I agree
[7:48] cuz I need some fuel because during the
[7:52] week you get all that credit of the word
[7:53] all da yen all right all that but this
[7:56] is to help you get over threat all of
[7:57] you you start for the word you got that
[8:00] money you just all right now if you're
[8:01] not remember if you don't need for two
[8:03] days you're what yeah we know you're on
[8:06] under you pass under he was hungry today
[8:08] so with it you're famished
[8:12] your your your wander gobble food you
[8:15] don't care what it is either
[8:16] yeah right yeah but we know that when we
[8:20] have the true tuning fork what we're
[8:22] talking about the word then then we know
[8:24] that that's true but we've got what
[8:26] we're talking about most people just
[8:27] think that seven seals open in 1963 and
[8:29] that's it the whole Bible has to be
[8:35] revealed
[8:35] not just the seven seals but that seven
[8:38] sealed book was a book of redemption so
[8:40] the only thing I can put if the property
[8:43] God told us he said he said that the
[8:46] thunders will I be the revelations
[8:48] contained in the sealed these divinely
[8:51] revealed Institute's will what literally
[8:53] turn us back so the problem is is we
[8:56] have a gun into the thunders we're
[8:57] introduced the surface of reading the
[8:59] loud man read your Bible for years and
[9:03] thousands of years Matthew 28:19
[9:05] repenting about doesn't follow simple
[9:08] ago okay and then here you've got like
[9:12] both angle your legs well that you know
[9:14] I don't think you need to be taken out
[9:16] of the book what Jesus is saying and
[9:18] he's telling us how to do
[9:21] come father's not a name sons not a name
[9:24] oh those my name then you come out of
[9:25] computers as keys to the kingdom I
[9:27] thought about the other day you know
[9:30] Peter people's give the teams to the
[9:33] king right right whatever you said
[9:37] whatever you know where what have you
[9:38] even let down there I'll click up there
[9:39] whatever you find out here I'll bind
[9:42] them up there all right but now where is
[9:44] that key to Peter when he got crucified
[9:47] and died do you take the key with him
[9:51] did Jesus specifically just give it to
[9:54] Peter
[9:54] our need to give it to the spokesman of
[9:57] the church wondered at Pentecost acts
[9:59] 2:38 to turn the key that I believe now
[10:02] that you and I are the same way yeah
[10:05] whatever you buy underwear cause
[10:07] remember brother Brown remember have to
[10:09] dream about binding the devil you bind
[10:11] me by the word you can't find the devil
[10:13] by being a human you have to find the
[10:16] devil by the Word of God Jesus bounded
[10:19] that well by the Word of God it is
[10:21] written it is written it is written and
[10:25] we're the last with the devil we need
[10:27] already let me start you can help us
[10:29] prove that but these seals then to me
[10:32] the seventh seal is a seventh seal book
[10:34] of redemption he's going to be talking
[10:37] about the breach later on and that's
[10:39] where redemption you see that the lamb
[10:42] comes and takes the book out of the hand
[10:43] of the one sitting on the throne all
[10:46] right and then everybody starts for
[10:47] Georgia then in Revelations 10:1 we see
[10:50] the mighty angel come down from heaven
[10:52] in TQ well now from heaven with the book
[10:57] open right and an open book means that
[11:00] we can go through that book it's not
[11:03] closed anymore we can go through that
[11:05] book and then actually John ate that
[11:08] book John being south deprived Jonah ate
[11:11] the book and it became a part of John
[11:13] you never saw that book anymore until
[11:16] the white throne judgment that boot
[11:17] comes back
[11:18] again tonight so it's not a literal book
[11:22] it's you I can read you like a book your
[11:25] life is an open book see so you're
[11:28] reading epistle known and read of all
[11:31] men so see we're we're we're not
[11:34] literally writing a Bible you can't
[11:36] write another Bible but we can write our
[11:38] part in the Bible
[11:41] all right then we can see our part so
[11:43] that's why I see the field are there a
[11:46] higher form of justification than we've
[11:48] never seen before a higher form of
[11:50] sanctification there was never seen
[11:51] before because look how special we are
[11:57] the reason we are so stable is this they
[12:03] bring church age 1 through 7 a beat
[12:07] that's the smarter Pergamus tire started
[12:09] still they'll get allowed to step all
[12:11] interpretation revelations to even the
[12:14] loudest interchange come under the what
[12:19] the new birth that was all it was
[12:22] required yes we be born you excited we
[12:28] got a brother that's asking the question
[12:31] about a word revival well it's got to be
[12:34] a word revival because we've already
[12:36] been revived when you're born again your
[12:38] revive your you're already Raptor
[12:40] sitting in heavenly places that's what
[12:41] Paul said all right sitting in heaven
[12:43] places in Christ Jesus so your soul has
[12:45] been lifted up out of the age right
[12:49] walking in God while the rest of us are
[12:53] still down the old are full the
[12:54] understanding was just to hear but when
[12:56] we come to them to the layout of seeing
[12:59] church age and then coming out of that
[13:01] way out of the entertain we are the only
[13:03] people that's going to get a revelation
[13:05] of these seven seals
[13:07] how many revelation not do - I can read
[13:12] this
[13:13] it's been written by millions of people
[13:15] it's being read by millions of scholars
[13:18] who has pulled it apart and put these
[13:19] pieces over here but he keeps going here
[13:23] this is going to take that prophetic
[13:25] group now you and I to see what the
[13:29] Thunder was it was revealed under the
[13:31] seal because remember it was something
[13:32] because John was getting ready to write
[13:34] it down
[13:34] now what would John be familiar with
[13:37] that he would want to write it so bad
[13:42] that's your connection because remember
[13:45] revelation 10 John don't write it he was
[13:48] getting ready to start writing down when
[13:50] he saw when the seven thunders uttered
[13:51] ever wanted he saw and began to write
[13:54] remember he was not commissioned to tell
[13:56] what he thought he was commissioned to
[13:57] write down what he saw right
[14:00] joy he wrote down what he saw he was
[14:02] getting ready to write angles it stopped
[14:04] hold that don't write that down so it
[14:06] was it is something and there's only one
[14:08] thing you can write down in a Bible next
[14:11] devote original book of redemption
[14:13] anything has to deal with Redemption you
[14:18] can tomorrow all those that you left to
[14:20] see them you have to see the red line of
[14:22] redemption from out of way we were
[14:25] talking the other day by Cain there's
[14:26] people in this message like the
[14:28] Brotherhood the people this message that
[14:29] do not believe Kane ever had a chance to
[14:31] be saved the Bible tells you had a
[14:33] chance right the Bible tells you that 10
[14:36] take it back to the pile the Bible's it
[14:39] came if you and it got insane and you're
[14:42] dead you're a son of the serpent in
[14:45] Europe you have no hope no he said if
[14:47] you'll do what your brother did back in
[14:50] other words I'll accept you just as I
[14:52] step they letting out him rejecting it
[14:56] did cause 2 lines to come down very
[15:00] obvious cause the two lines but like we
[15:03] were probably know they you trade the
[15:05] sons of guarding the daughters of man
[15:06] you can't start putting them back
[15:07] together in Babylon and all these things
[15:09] and they just get mixed up if Raley's
[15:11] are marrying this one that's why I got
[15:12] the separator
[15:13] don't you marry people right you stay
[15:15] here and they didn't the Levi's were
[15:18] supposed to stay pure that's why men
[15:20] that we as we see that time that
[15:22] ministers are not supposed to be dull
[15:24] made and I'm going to have a living life
[15:25] they're not supposed to do these things
[15:27] right what this character said why
[15:30] because God will keep that line here and
[15:32] then all right
[15:33] Mayer bourbon is a winner freak so and
[15:37] that means something it's not just
[15:39] written a it means that God wants to
[15:40] keep he wanted a Levitical line under
[15:42] state pure and it did they started just
[15:45] mingling back in together and right now
[15:47] we're just let me sure we trace our
[15:50] lineage back to certain places but but
[15:52] there's only three now challenge a bat
[15:55] hit play I told three we come from all
[15:58] right so there's only three times of
[15:59] people that's kind of playing a three
[16:02] kinds of believers there's three kinds
[16:03] of people you know may believe what I
[16:05] believe are true believer in their camps
[16:06] and Jake that so that's what we all come
[16:09] from everybody you look on Eve you look
[16:11] at all these things no taking three him
[16:14] loosely people you how that all happened
[16:17] I hope one day that God will allow us to
[16:19] set a theater I'm always this is my
[16:21] desire
[16:22] it's a sitteth Pierre in the future home
[16:24] and watch God from creation and watch
[16:27] the whole process come down through and
[16:30] watch how all these things develop well
[16:35] why can't you do that it's already in
[16:36] his mind he came right straight from the
[16:38] vision he had and all he's got to do is
[16:41] televise it don't you make it far off
[16:45] television night television right
[16:52] it says that once once we're with God we
[16:59] showed you calm add God and know all man
[17:02] that's right yes I believe that straight
[17:06] that straight when we see we're so
[17:09] finite we're so limited to this the man
[17:13] we become unlimited you know you you
[17:16] still you know you can go sit on Mars if
[17:19] you want that what are the matter you
[17:23] know you can go do whatever you want to
[17:25] do it like I said it's pretty unlimited
[17:29] but I would still like to sit down and
[17:31] watch like a bad thing it's kind of all
[17:33] the junk you know just but but the jest
[17:36] of the history of how the other thing
[17:38] come down how them free ham Shem Japheth
[17:40] distributed the earth and then you got
[17:43] the black you got the Chinese you've got
[17:45] the Filipino you can ever looking differ
[17:47] from different places and I my theory on
[17:50] that - so lovely so well it's what you
[17:54] even where you live I need the same
[17:57] thing she's for the rest of my life and
[17:59] I will never get black and I can go to
[18:02] Africa South Africa it's full of white
[18:04] people right so white they turn black
[18:07] say something genetically that happened
[18:10] in all that coming down game up boom
[18:15] anybody yeah that's true but I think
[18:18] this is my dog will tell you anyway
[18:20] because if we destroyed ourselves
[18:23] properties also maybe a nuclear
[18:25] explosion men set off a nuclear bomb it
[18:28] tilted the earth and made those quarters
[18:30] of the date come up what if there was
[18:33] radiation and this group of people went
[18:36] this way there was more radiation
[18:37] completion I'm not saying anything
[18:40] different what the Prophet said but you
[18:41] can't when I started as a babies you
[18:43] can't feed me soul food and meat are
[18:45] black right are you see me well I didn't
[18:51] say this Allah people putting energy you
[18:53] know someone's in here so it can't be
[18:56] juhi I mean how can a tiny de like this
[19:00] and it be because of worries limit you
[19:03] know there's nothing genetic don't know
[19:05] I am I'm here oh you're going to the
[19:08] kids and fifty was also to put yellow
[19:10] wire lay that way in everybody else is

[19:15] Chinese and mais no turning your kids
[19:18] was not all of them somehow my genes so
[19:25] well for finance leaders blizzard hit
[19:27] really what that got to do is I'll have
[19:31] a place but you know what though it is
[19:33] doesn't tell me one thing that God is
[19:35] opening our eyes to everything they even
[19:37] here that will be aware of the things
[19:40] that are going on around us and know
[19:41] that we all come from one blood take all
[19:43] our blood together and it's already you
[19:46] know I'm not raising such as I know them
[19:48] through five I'm not saying that I'm

[20:37] remember what he said he said that lamb
[20:39] was justified yeah he said that lamb
[20:43] didn't do it it wasn't just a problem
[20:46] like we did it now God forgive occasion
[20:48] he wasn't a lamb did I'm not like a
[20:50] little baby lamb to love sacrifice and
[20:53] lamb didn't do anything that lamb had no
[20:56] sin all right so what's our role with
[21:02] our problem
[21:03] you know our justification is cuz we did
[21:05] all this that Lambs justification is he
[21:08] never did it he's ever did in the first
[21:12] leg that's where we're coming to this
[21:16] pit filled you in glazed eyes never
[21:20] sinned we're going to get to that this
[21:22] afternoon bro they'll be talking about
[21:24] the mind of God we're going to we're
[21:26] going to get up in that and take a look
[21:27] at this afternoon and I'll be held me
[21:29] and over the seats filled it was a great
[21:31] earthquake know what's going to happen
[21:32] DS all things are going to happen
[21:34] naturally this is a natural occurrence
[21:37] right our nature occurrence and the Sun
[21:40] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[21:42] the moon became as blood starts with
[21:44] having fell into the earth and even as
[21:45] the fig tree casts her untimely figs
[21:47] when shaken of a mighty wind and having
[21:51] part of the scroll when it is rolled
[21:52] together and every mountain and Island
[21:54] were moved out of their places it's just
[21:57] every island so this is a worldwide
[21:59] event that's going to happen alright and
[22:02] they came to the earth and the great
[22:03] man's rich man chief captains and the
[22:05] mighty men and every bondman and every
[22:06] free man hid themselves in the dens and
[22:09] in the rocks of the mountain and said to
[22:11] the mountains and rocks fall on us and
[22:12] hide us from the face of him that
[22:14] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[22:15] of the lamb for the great day of his
[22:17] wrath is come and who shall be able to
[22:21] stand now the problem with these people
[22:23] are is this is just like a little bitty
[22:25] pre-tribulation thing comes about
[22:27] Armageddon genome is 1,250 days actually
[22:29] probably so preaching okay so let's go
[22:32] now to revelation 11 different
[22:41] and see how there's a note because this
[22:44] deal six deal is going to open in its
[22:46] natural form while the two prophets are
[22:50] on the earth while Israel is getting
[22:51] their Redemption 144 Valerie and it was
[22:54] given to me a read on the garage the
[22:56] angel stood saying rise and measure the
[22:58] temple of God the altar and them that
[22:59] worship therein but the court which is
[23:02] without the temple leave out and measure
[23:04] it not pretty given unto the Gentiles in
[23:06] the Holy City shall they tread under
[23:07] foot forty and two months
[23:09] now we know to the study of the damned
[23:12] 70 weeks 42 months that is 40 to 30 day
[23:18] months not 28 30 31 prophetic calendar
[23:23] the prophetic calendar is always 30 days
[23:26] in the month
[23:27] alright so that's how you get closer to
[23:29] you today because about blood but you
[23:32] can take 42 months times 32 or 31 or 28
[23:35] or we're all that stuff but God told her
[23:38] if he's always perfect that moon comes
[23:39] in just about right on time and it will
[23:42] be but the earth wobbling so it's it's
[23:44] welcome to have that occurrence tomorrow
[23:47] because remember tomorrow night
[23:49] everybody's gonna season five of those
[23:52] you're doing then earth wobbling back
[23:55] and forth you only comes here by two
[23:56] minutes in certain places you're gonna
[23:58] 30 seconds in certain places and we are
[24:01] in the travel path of it so we're going
[24:03] to get two minutes of Darkness so why
[24:06] because everything's you know everything
[24:09] topsy-turvy
[24:11] and I will give power unto my two
[24:13] witnesses they shall prophesy a thousand
[24:16] two hundred and threescore with three
[24:17] scores what three times 260 1260 days
[24:23] clothed in sackcloth these are the two
[24:26] olive trees and the two candlesticks
[24:27] standing before the god of the earth and
[24:30] if he may will hurt them fire proceedeth
[24:32] out of their mouth and devoureth their
[24:34] enemy
[24:34] if the ax man will hurt them he must in
[24:36] this manner be killed these have power
[24:40] to shut heaven that it rain not in the
[24:43] days of their prophecy and have power
[24:45] over waters to turn them to blood this
[24:47] my viewers all plagues as often as they
[24:49] will okay
[24:52] so but the problem is is the people the
[24:55] Arabs not will leave alone they're going
[24:58] to try to figure out a way killer
[24:59] don't you worry they don't figure out a
[25:01] way he'll okay go they're going to
[25:04] torment this earth for 42 months but now
[25:08] somewhere in there they going to call
[25:11] out a hundred forty-four thousand they
[25:12] were preached a gospel to them and I
[25:15] don't believe there will be the only one
[25:16] preaching the gospel because I believe
[25:18] that they can and it's a certain once
[25:20] and they'll give the gospel out to you I
[25:21] understand that same way we are now
[25:25] English men forever and ever
[25:27] but God has two conduits that he's
[25:29] coming down through profits to problems
[25:32] he's coming down through the spirit of
[25:33] Moses and fear of Elijah right because
[25:36] because of the characteristics who's
[25:39] just ahead with a Rehan for three and a
[25:40] half here United he was trying to River
[25:43] to blood Moses my German so not the two
[25:46] literal people but the spirit of Eliezer
[25:49] the spirit of Moses on those two people
[25:53] on those two prophet and they help fire
[25:56] them whenever they won't do they call
[25:58] earthquakes whatever they wanted
[26:00] so what do we see now we come up to the
[26:03] place tonight
[26:03] I haven't ever included this before but
[26:06] we are taking inclusion disposing work
[26:12] that's what it is they're speaking the
[26:15] word that is inside their heart okay
[26:21] because we must come to that there's the
[26:25] third pole there's the what man has been
[26:29] waiting six Adam Adam has the spoken
[26:31] word I would speak that dream you can
[26:33] talk this one he say the movement here
[26:35] you do this and then Jesus Christ the
[26:37] spoken word in himself
[26:38] this isn't it same thing peace be still
[26:41] you know water to wine all these
[26:44] different things that he's done which
[26:46] was all in natural occurrence Jesus
[26:49] never created anything right he always
[26:51] use what we call ready creates our
[26:55] and there's a thought behind that we'll
[26:58] leave it for a minute they're closing
[27:00] words so we see that through tooth
[27:01] profits there will be a nature cleansing
[27:04] of the world because what's his heading
[27:06] toward according to Daniel seventy weeks
[27:08] and the Bible is heading towards battle
[27:11] Armageddon other than let me feel them
[27:13] getting okay it's headed toward the
[27:16] Battle of Armageddon right we leave we
[27:21] leave there's one week left for the Jew
[27:24] right we're in 2070 weeks and in the
[27:27] midst of the week this guy's going to
[27:29] come the contract of the sacrifice are
[27:32] the because he's gonna cut that covenant
[27:37] off boy he's gonna kill these big
[27:38] profits well then you're going to start
[27:40] the battle Armageddon which is going to
[27:41] be under man killing each other
[27:45] atomic explosion so how do they do with
[27:48] this he's going to fight for his rule
[27:49] about sex but he's not going to store
[27:52] the world man to destroy the world if I
[27:53] got that watch this is over we're all
[27:59] going to come back for a thousand years
[28:00] and I don't see that everything is going
[28:04] to be totally annihilated
[28:06] I believe the buildings will still be
[28:07] here do you think we'll be here because
[28:09] the propagate floated under to
[28:10] everything right
[28:12] judge the stores people they got
[28:14] involved now it just kills people needs
[28:15] the building's huge drug problems
[28:17] neutron bomb exactly so mad man is going
[28:20] to kill each other
[28:21] then they'll leave the building there
[28:23] and now see that's where the difference
[28:24] in that in the future home is because
[28:26] then there's a Battle of Gog and make up
[28:28] we're all sold or killed that are that
[28:31] are evil what Windows went all sold
[28:34] repeal and then there's a city in
[28:35] revelation 22 it's coming down out of
[28:37] heaven then we're going to live in now
[28:39] they won't be that's not a city that was
[28:42] built by man alright that city Jesus is
[28:46] I go to prepare a place for you know
[28:48] hammer nails but I'm going to bring a
[28:50] city and the properties God thank God
[28:52] for a man
[28:53] liking the - dog told us he said he is
[28:54] going to build that city by your design
[28:58] your desire there's a bride of Christ
[29:00] he's going to build it by your desire so
[29:04] my desire of a home is going to be right
[29:06] there
[29:07] that's how much he thinks about us okay
[29:09] a man ain't created anyway wants to but
[29:13] he's not he's going to create about your
[29:15] desire
[29:16] he's your house and your little Avenue
[29:18] and your little lark is going to be
[29:20] which isn't the way you like it cuz you
[29:22] know what you better like it yes
[29:35] what daughter saw it symbology well that
[29:37] City came down he's all people in it
[29:39] because remember a city is just building
[29:42] what is Gainesville Georgia what is Lila
[29:45] Jordan is not the building it's the
[29:48] people in them if there was nobody here
[29:50] with me see the city has always been the
[29:52] people some John sees the bride I'm sure
[29:55] white robes don't everybody coming down
[29:58] and settling down on the earth
[30:00] and there's your pride sitting as a
[30:02] bride adorned for her husband after all
[30:06] this ordering this we going to create
[30:10] children like proof there's a boy child
[30:13] or dogs Katniss they don't be a whole
[30:17] thing will be a whole create procreation
[30:20] or creation after we get out after we
[30:23] get when you get a glorified body
[30:26] there's no more there's no more desire
[30:30] where I see I want it in my brain Alice
[30:33] afternoon hour Coraline was killed me
[30:36] and say our Karl the carnality of our
[30:39] thinking you and I listen every person
[30:43] on this earth whether you like it or not
[30:44] except one man was born to a carnal
[30:47] conception
[30:48] carnal conception but the desire we're
[30:52] all adults a desire of sex between a man
[30:56] and woman right even if you were
[30:59] artificially inseminated it was an act
[31:02] yeah why did Jesus not have a car line
[31:05] he did not come through a carnal daddy
[31:08] and a carnal one right we all came to a
[31:14] carnal daddy in a carnal month whether
[31:17] they're born in era they still had the
[31:19] carnality of having that relationship
[31:21] that should have never happened in the
[31:23] first one okay if I got that though one
[31:27] man yes why was period white had no sin
[31:29] in other words what he didn't have any
[31:31] nature to lean back oh that will solve
[31:32] everything
[31:33] following never a problem at the
[31:35] Polynesian we may talk about a little
[31:37] bit more this afternoon that pollinators
[31:38] what skills yeah that nature their mama
[31:41] and daddy because of their carnality
[31:44] listen that's why you know the age of
[31:48] accountability it's about 12 13 14 years
[31:51] old some more some less why is that you
[31:54] become more sexually mature yes Frank
[31:56] start thinking about things dating when
[31:57] he was a kid
[31:58] black girl about that you're like I said
[32:00] you put a five-year-old one - girl -
[32:02] bathtub and they just play house in town
[32:04] there's no problem
[32:05] don't put this in your old girl in 50
[32:08] year old after the other they'll be well
[32:12] they'll be playing with the rubber ducky
[32:15] will be go what train to people trained
[32:19] to be Saints people under a more
[32:22] effective why there's some development
[32:25] in the Carl mind that's why the purity I
[32:28] love the purity of children
[32:29] I love the purity of innocence of
[32:32] children and anybody takes that away on
[32:34] and have their head chopped off yeah I
[32:35] meant
[32:37] but that while that is is what that's
[32:40] what it's supposed to have been the
[32:42] innocence crime
[32:43] the man yeah we we couldn't do that
[32:54] cause there wasn't you couldn't do it
[32:57] count to death you know you we populate
[33:00] dying repopulated when that city come
[33:03] down to revelation 22 that's all that
[33:06] God ever saw in his mind it was issue
[33:09] and that's all he needed because all he
[33:12] saw it was continuing so the Jesus
[33:17] Christ coming to fulfill prophecy and
[33:19] save mankind without a carnal attribute
[33:27] so the anti carnal cat rebuke in Babylon
[33:33] he threatened it as Egypt about
[33:36] worshipers I'll let a they worship the
[33:39] carnal and then we are to worship the
[33:43] knock card we'll see we're not this far
[33:45] from truth and error is only this far
[33:47] far back because we're supposed to make
[33:50] love in Jesus - right but not with our
[33:53] that you aren't that one gram okay what
[33:56] in our soul in our be we're supposed to
[34:00] make love to Jesus Christ
[34:01] just like the man longlegs left but not
[34:04] the way you see when I say that you went
[34:06] straight to two parts one part man part
[34:09] these as you know is what that's they
[34:12] out of the mouth now if your spoken word
[34:17] is the original seed may I love that
[34:21] program to priest out a hundred more
[34:22] times the spoken word here's the
[34:25] original thing the main he did not freak
[34:27] them out he's a great pilot but the
[34:30] spoken word is the original seat
[34:36] that's correct right
[34:39] it's not it's not that's what I mean
[34:41] though see see you can take example of
[34:45] our human growing up and you can type it
[34:47] as your newborn babe in Christ but you
[34:50] can't have it all the way because one
[34:53] thing pops up car one God never had a
[34:57] carnal mind Jesus never had a car model
[34:59] okay and it was the same but when he
[35:02] came down here he's never had coal mine
[35:03] because what we do is what our problem
[35:06] a car line is the intimacy the somebody
[35:09] else's car lies is the image of the car
[35:13] well okay that's the problem what we see
[35:19] face bills metal here does having to do
[35:21] with it
[35:21] well we memory reason conscious
[35:24] reflection and imagination that the
[35:26] playground that we have to deal with but
[35:28] through what but then God though takes
[35:30] that carnal mind until tall through the
[35:34] whole goat that we must have in mind
[35:36] Christ okay so there's your mind coming
[35:39] in and overlaying and killing that old
[35:42] nature you're out listen my blokes God
[35:47] loves your if you're born again he loved
[35:48] your nature whether you like it or not
[35:50] there's a part of God that he likes the
[35:52] God part not the human part you got
[35:55] heart right because I'm going to tell
[35:58] you something Daniel and I are not going
[36:01] to be in heaven sent over the corner
[36:03] like maybe sister Barbara sitting is
[36:05] that a free words in 10 years
[36:10] you slip I knew you're thinking no we're
[36:14] going to watch we're going to but you
[36:15] don't hear us in other words just a
[36:17] barber you may have to get real close to
[36:18] here you know but that's your nature
[36:21] that you know what I love that yeah
[36:23] that's not a flaw it's not a flaw here
[36:28] we have laws but when you have to look
[36:29] and see that what God puts together let
[36:33] no man see if you say well I've got to
[36:36] do with marriage
[36:37] well are we we're in Christ what do I
[36:39] push together between him and the bride
[36:41] there's none of our business
[36:43] he's going to use that for some purpose
[36:45] and we need to deal with that you know I
[36:48] don't I don't deal with the department
[36:50] all for being quiet but then I always
[36:52] say well I wish I was just quite a turn
[36:54] no I don't I bus I'll be going I'll be
[37:03] like this Stay Puft Marshmallow Man I'll
[37:05] explode all over boy yeah what those
[37:10] buggers you don't know what to say
[37:14] Louis you watch that this your mark I'm
[37:18] sorry
[37:18] okay many might see the waggly where the
[37:20] carnal line now but less but this book
[37:24] will happen the bank when they have
[37:25] finished their problems you would get
[37:27] back to them when they have finished and
[37:29] when they shall have finished their
[37:30] testimony the Beast that ascends out of
[37:33] the bottomless pit shall make war
[37:34] against them and shall overcome them and
[37:36] kill them
[37:37] and their dead bodies shall lie in the
[37:39] street of the great city which
[37:40] spiritually called Sodom and Egypt where
[37:42] our Lord was crucified and they are the
[37:44] people and Cameron incomes the nation's
[37:46] shall see this is the only age as you
[37:48] can see CNN will be there Fox News all
[37:51] those news people will be there with
[37:54] camera hey this this to go warm it

[38:05] merry Wow because these two people are
[38:07] land dead

[38:15] going to give gift that back to the old
[38:16] car like you some I built a kitty you

[38:20] thing guess all days away I'm talking
[38:23] that's in gifts and all these things and
[38:24] those little things that they wore
[38:25] around our head or I have that all knit
[38:27] something
[38:28] it's a carnal yep well they're only
[38:30] giving gifts too but look what happens
[38:33] they're going to get a big surprise the
[38:35] commentator is going to come in one day
[38:36] and they're going to be gone or they go
[38:38] stand up on their feet and great fear
[38:41] fell upon them which saw them they heard
[38:43] a great voice from heaven saying to them
[38:45] come a pillar their city doesn't heaven
[38:47] in the cloud their enemies to be held in
[38:49] this is the same error was a great
[38:51] earthquake tenth part of the city fell
