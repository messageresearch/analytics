[1:13] a man just trying around to shake hands
[1:16] with one another you know just looking
[1:19] at him so if he want to see him open
[1:21] your eyes man good to see everybody in
[1:23] the house of the Lord ready to have a
[1:25] brother
[1:25] Nathanael are with us and we was
[1:27] expecting brother Joe to be tonight and
[1:29] he he kind of got sick on us and had to
[1:32] be out but pray for him I talked to him
[1:35] this afternoon and he said that he was
[1:38] doing better but he still having a lot
[1:41] of problems and had a called it a
[1:43] urinary tract infection and so just
[1:46] remember to pray for that brother al is
[1:48] home he got home today from the hospital
[1:51] and the doctors are saying that what
[1:54] they'd done they gave him the medication
[1:55] they called it to file everything up and
[1:59] he would make his blood pressure go down
[2:01] and then he'd make it go up and the
[2:03] different things so he's doing better
[2:05] but said the doctor said well I've done
[2:07] all I can do you know he is getting
[2:10] better so you know when we get down to
[2:13] the end of the road and say we've done
[2:14] all the doctor can do we know who to
[2:17] turn to
[2:18] we turn to God and we believe it so just
[2:21] remember them them and just keep them in
[2:24] your prayers all right if you like
[2:26] turning your scriptures turn to jaw -
[2:29] now what we're going to do tonight
[2:33] because this is why I'm speaking I would
[2:37] I believe what I said Sunday is right
[2:41] but I want to make sure you understand
[2:44] what I'm talking about
[2:46] so I'm gonna repeat again what a preach
[2:49] Sunday and it'll be almost a total
[2:51] repeat if I read the notes but that
[2:54] generally don't work better way but I
[2:55] want to try to do it because I believe
[2:59] it's very needful for us to understand
[3:02] right where we are in this day and
[3:05] follow into that line so listen to the
[3:08] thoughts of what what we're talking
[3:10] about
[3:11] also remember now the Bible study this
[3:13] coming Saturday and come and be with us
[3:16] and the Christmas dinner remember that
[3:20] one on what is the fifteenth whatever
[3:22] sixteenth remember that and then the
[3:25] watch night service remember that
[3:27] remember there won't be any services on
[3:32] that thirty if I guess it is every what
[3:35] falls called that fall on Sunday we
[3:37] won't be having go with house Sunday and
[3:39] in with how Monday for the watch night
[3:42] so we won't have that service you know
[3:45] that day but we'll do that we've got
[3:48] kind of a little tickle out of something
[3:51] we heard that you know we changed and
[3:53] said we're going to have our rough from
[3:56] now and we're going to have our Tuesday
[3:58] night service before Thanksgiving
[4:01] instead of a Wednesday night service
[4:03] well I heard somebody said well you know
[4:06] that's a good idea we'll try it maybe
[4:08] it'll start a trend or do something you
[4:09] know at least one thing about it they're
[4:11] listening in because they they heard
[4:13] we're doing somebody's talking about it
[4:15] you know but that's for that only now
[4:17] for that that one time only in November
[4:21] so now we're not just changing it to
[4:24] Tuesday don't show up on Tuesday and say
[4:26] well you said it no I didn't say it I'm
[4:29] saying that's what we're supposed to be
[4:31] doing okay
[4:32] so keep these things in your mind and
[4:34] all of the announcements remember to
[4:36] pray as I said for brother I'll remember
[4:39] my wife she fell this week and hurt her
[4:42] back and everything so just keep her in
[4:44] your prayers that Lord would take care
[4:46] of her and help her along the way in
[4:48] that so let's pray before we read our
[4:51] scripture father we thank you
[4:55] for your grace and your love and we ask
[4:58] you now that you would just come among
[4:59] us and just be with us and father that
[5:02] we would be able to speak what you would
[5:05] have to be said because that's what
[5:07] we're dependent upon you we know that we
[5:10] have nothing within ourselves we depend
[5:13] upon you to be able to tell us what to
[5:17] say and give us that word forgive our
[5:19] sins and cleanse us and keep us Lord and
[5:22] remember the sick among us
[5:24] you said you sent your word and healed
[5:26] them and delivered it from destruction
[5:27] so just be with each one we love you and
[5:30] we thank you remember the sick all among
[5:32] us Lord there's many things and many
[5:34] getting them to the aged factors and the
[5:37] things Lord that Satan's taking his toll
[5:40] upon these old human bodies but yet we
[5:42] know we have a Heavenly Father who is
[5:45] the healer deliverer he's everything and
[5:47] we depend upon you we love you and we
[5:49] thank you in Jesus name Amen
[5:54] Joe 2:22 be not afraid you beast of the
[6:03] field for the pastures of the wilderness
[6:06] new spring for the tree birth her fruit
[6:09] in the fig tree and the vine to yield
[6:14] their strength be glad then you children
[6:16] of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[6:19] for he hath given you the former rain
[6:22] moderately now I love that okay and he
[6:26] will cause to come down for you the rain
[6:29] the former rain and the latter rain in
[6:33] the first month alright and the floor
[6:36] shall be full of wheat and the fat shall
[6:38] overflow with wine and all
[6:42] and I will restore to you the years that
[6:45] the locusts have eaten the cake of worm
[6:47] and the caterpillar and the Palmer were
[6:50] my great army which I sent among you and
[6:53] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[6:54] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[6:58] that have dealt wondrously with you and
[7:00] my people shall never be ashamed now
[7:04] like this and you shall know that I am
[7:06] in the midst of Israel and that I am the
[7:10] Lord your God and none else and my
[7:13] people shall never be ashamed let's just
[7:16] stop Dark Lord we know the next it comes
[7:18] to the pouring out of the spirit so you
[7:19] may be seated
[7:20] it comes to the pouring out of the
[7:22] Spirit of God and do it now I want you
[7:25] to keep one thought in mind to not
[7:29] remember all the way through the Prophet
[7:32] said that when the people of any time
[7:37] that they're in he said like the days of
[7:40] Moses he said when they begin to cry out
[7:43] they get serious he said God would
[7:47] always come on the scene
[7:49] well now keep that in mind as we go
[7:51] through each stage again that we went
[7:54] through Sunday to be able to get a
[7:56] better understanding and follow that
[7:58] thought all right see then it may turn
[8:02] one day to see that hey are we crying
[8:05] out you know it may take persecution the
[8:12] Prophet said the bride always done er
[8:14] the church always done better under
[8:16] persecution you know if you think Oh
[8:18] make us cry out it's gonna put a little
[8:20] persecution on them get us you know get
[8:22] a little soft living away from us and
[8:26] put it down to the hard things but all
[8:28] right now keep that in mind as we go
[8:31] along
[8:31] that what we're talking about is the
[8:35] former and latter rain all right the
[8:39] former and latter rain according to the
[8:42] anointed ones at the end time fire wrath
[8:44] 36 the prophet said the former and the
[8:47] latter rain was the Spirit of God that
[8:52] would move among the people see it's a
[8:55] former rain
[8:56] and then it's the latter right the seed
[8:59] has to do with what is produced the rain
[9:02] just brings it forth and makes it alive
[9:06] alright see so the form of rain is a
[9:08] pouring out of God's Spirit the latter
[9:10] rain is a pouring out of God's Spirit
[9:12] it's just according to what it's being
[9:14] done what's taking place all right now
[9:17] so keep that in mind as we go along see
[9:21] and so we tried to illustrate down
[9:25] through time and we picked up there you
[9:27] know about just starting with John the
[9:29] Baptist's and as he come to introduce
[9:32] the Messiah he said behold the lamb of
[9:35] God who takes away the sin of the world
[9:36] that was his message he sold a former
[9:40] Ryan his message was that you know that
[9:44] he sewed the word and God quickened that
[9:47] word or poured out on that word and it
[9:51] would make it alive because dead letter
[9:54] is not worth anything it's the alive
[9:55] word the word living in each one of us
[9:58] alright
[9:59] see and John he said to judge you know
[10:02] he brought the message of the coming of
[10:05] the Messiah all right
[10:07] see then the massage stepped right out
[10:09] on what John said and there he was the
[10:12] latter rain to what John had brought
[10:15] because Jesus become the word John spoke
[10:19] and the Bible says then and the Word was
[10:22] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[10:24] beheld as you don't know and the the
[10:26] Word of God the Lord Jesus was that word
[10:30] that was made alive a living word a dead
[10:34] letter is not worth anything to us
[10:36] it's the Living Word so remember we're
[10:39] trying to see that each age each time
[10:42] remember we're talking about sowing rain
[10:45] a message goes forth all right then
[10:51] God will quicken that and make it alive
[10:55] and then that will turn out to be as it
[10:59] progresses through it wound up being to
[11:01] a ladder rain or a harvest rain all
[11:05] right now then that'll that'll bring it
[11:08] forth
[11:09] to the time all right see in Jesus now
[11:12] was the alive word that John had said it
[11:16] so now keep that in your mind no matter
[11:20] when we get in the ages and we talk
[11:21] about a messenger bringing the message
[11:23] remember that somebody got to make that
[11:26] alive now what would have been any good
[11:30] if he just stood out turned and said the
[11:32] Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[11:33] the world nobody appeared what good
[11:37] would that be all right we see it
[11:40] appeared right there that God came on
[11:42] the scene
[11:45] right there too before to be the latter
[11:48] rain are quickening are the alive word
[11:52] for that day all right that was you
[11:56] following that with me see then when
[11:58] Jesus he sold the message he preached
[12:02] the message for three and a half years
[12:04] that was his former reign teaching reign
[12:09] all right
[12:10] he was the alive word that brought that
[12:13] word unto us all right then we see that
[12:17] the disciples heard that word and as
[12:20] they did they took that word and they
[12:22] held onto it and when it come to the day
[12:25] of Pentecost the Holy Ghost made that
[12:27] word alive and the disciples became what
[12:31] Jesus had spoke now don't forget that
[12:34] that's the point added to I keep adding
[12:37] these little things they don't put down
[12:38] notes even though it got the same notes
[12:40] I'm right in little charts so remember
[12:43] now that we're talking about the alive
[12:47] word not just letters
[12:51] you know it's the alive word that's that
[12:54] we're dealing with so Jesus when he sold
[12:57] the word he was not made alive even
[13:03] though it says to the disciples he
[13:05] opened their understanding of the
[13:06] scriptures and thought that was good but
[13:08] that's still not that didn't make it
[13:09] alive no they had to go to the upper
[13:13] room and wait in the upper room then
[13:16] produced the Holy Spirit to bring that
[13:19] word alive that was in those disciples
[13:21] okay and when he did see it made the
[13:27] alive word standing on the earth the
[13:31] disciples was the alive word they're not
[13:36] just just say well they were just people
[13:38] with no no they were the alive word
[13:41] there was no way that God could do it in
[13:44] any other way then the way he'd done it
[13:47] and by him being able to do it and we
[13:51] know he did then there's no way it could
[13:53] be any other way
[13:54] that's right God can't change his mind
[13:59] and say well I failed doing that so I'll
[14:01] work out some of the way no it can't be
[14:04] so remember then Jesus showed that word
[14:07] and the disciples heard it and held it
[14:11] and see then when it went to the
[14:14] Pentecost the Holy Ghost made that alive
[14:16] and brother Branham said because the
[14:18] scripture had said will he teach you
[14:20] things to come
[14:21] and brother Brown said it with it I
[14:23] actually went on further and told him
[14:25] other more more onto it other than just
[14:29] the point of what he had said he opened
[14:32] the word unto him all right they became
[14:35] the alive word the living word was
[14:39] standing on earth just as much as it was
[14:41] when Jesus was standing on earth the
[14:44] only difference was the body
[14:48] Jesus was in a body that was not brought
[14:50] forth by mankind but mankind brought
[14:53] that you know as he was that body he was
[14:56] those people but just remember whatever
[15:00] he makes you you are that now don't
[15:05] forget
[15:07] this next one don't forget to the next
[15:11] point the disciples then the disciples
[15:18] upon receiving the Holy Ghost and it
[15:21] quickening them see it didn't just put
[15:23] them down here at the bottom it faith it
[15:27] put them up here where it says Holy
[15:29] Spirit
[15:30] all right gave them what would be called
[15:34] the faith of the fathers all right now
[15:37] watch that don't lose that I don't care
[15:41] what you think about it listen to what
[15:44] say it and just consider the point
[15:47] those disciples begin to preach that
[15:50] word not just a new birth word but a
[15:55] stature of a perfect man adoption and
[15:57] the things Paul and him called alright
[16:01] somebody believed that and you know what
[16:04] became that the people believed it and
[16:08] became what Paul and him I mean what
[16:11] what Peter named had preached and it
[16:14] brought it out to the basis that the
[16:16] faith of the fathers came into view now
[16:19] you can think what you want to about it
[16:22] being eating the way we'll cover that in
[16:23] the ages but just remember it's supposed
[16:26] to be restored now the Prophet said the
[16:30] same Holy Ghost that justified the
[16:33] lutheran sanctified the Methodists
[16:35] baptized the Pentecostals he's now
[16:37] sitting in order to coming of the Lord
[16:40] now I didn't say these things so you're
[16:43] gonna have to argue with him see about
[16:45] it and I don't mean that in the wrong
[16:47] door or Tory thing I just mean it we're
[16:49] looking for something a lot of times to
[16:51] happen when it's already happening and
[16:55] we don't see it that's why I kept
[17:01] pounding on your door Sunday
[17:04] turn your computer on runny and former
[17:07] and latter rain and listen to the things
[17:09] brother branham boca he would call the
[17:13] Pentecostal people he'd say you've had a
[17:16] lot of rain
[17:18] he said you've had this teaching and
[17:20] even had a ladder he'd say the Baptist
[17:23] has had a ladder this one it's a million
[17:26] more than 44 he'd he'd say those but
[17:28] then he when he got to spoken words
[17:29] original seed he come up through there
[17:34] preaching that message that's why I've
[17:35] asked you to to listen to it I read it
[17:38] when he come up to that bringing it
[17:41] he had it laid out and he said two
[17:43] denominations who struck the world and
[17:45] he said the word had been sown pure and
[17:48] unadulterated
[17:50] then he said Lord there's something
[17:53] wrong said I've got him out on the limb
[17:57] now what to do because he's seen that he
[17:59] could that's as far as he can go he saw
[18:04] there was nothing else for him to do on
[18:06] what he was doing he had preached the
[18:08] faith of the Father he had preached that
[18:11] he had produced the statue of a perfect
[18:13] man in his own life I believe that he
[18:15] had produced the adoption to the stages
[18:18] and things within his life and there was
[18:21] no way to go and the Lord said pick up
[18:24] your pen and ride he picked up his pen
[18:27] and wrote you Nonie wrote the message
[18:28] and I've asked you to do it
[18:30] read the message then read what God's
[18:32] holding the rock
[18:34] it's identical I don't mean word for a
[18:37] word identical if the point is identical
[18:40] the point is that brother Branham had
[18:44] preached the faith of the fathers and
[18:46] was standing there believing that but he
[18:51] knew that wouldn't enough
[18:52] I know people just look at me and they
[18:57] when I've said it this away for 40 years
[18:59] I said if everybody in the world had the
[19:02] faith of the father's they still
[19:05] wouldn't be no right it'd be a wonderful
[19:08] world be a great place to be but that
[19:11] wouldn't bring the rapture because
[19:12] that's not that there's not enough word
[19:14] though that turns you back to where the
[19:18] disciples were we got to go on beyond
[19:21] that we under the Sun I'm not saying go
[19:25] beyond brother branham I said it right
[19:28] going beyond where the disciples stopped
[19:31] off with their message because that's
[19:32] what the Holy Spirit told the Prophet he
[19:35] says and he wrote him right and he
[19:38] brought it right down that plate and he
[19:39] said as of yet Malachi 4 is not
[19:43] fulfilled well he says in the front of
[19:47] the book Malachi forceful fail he says
[19:50] on on book 1 which was the morning he
[19:53] said now look how forceful failed
[19:58] let's see member the one thing that I
[20:01] keep quoting to you
[20:02] 327 church age book why does it say this
[20:06] messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 will
[20:09] do two things 1 turn the hearts of the
[20:12] children back to bring the thunders
[20:15] which are the revelation contained in
[20:16] the seven seals so what was missing
[20:20] if brother Branham had preached it back
[20:22] to the faith of the fathers what was
[20:24] missing in his life that he couldn't
[20:26] move on
[20:29] come on though he said I got him out on
[20:32] the limb Lord what can I do
[20:35] the Lord says that I've kept Malachi for
[20:38] is not fulfilled part of it had been but
[20:41] all of it happened see because the seals
[20:44] did not come forth the Prophet did not
[20:47] brought his message till his matches
[20:52] begin in the seals it's not him actually
[20:54] forget 247 know he's a message begun for
[20:57] the foundation world if you're going
[20:58] that away so alright but listen
[21:03] now watch the point and watch it come
[21:07] forth and follow a line up right through
[21:10] the ages right out to where we're at all
[21:14] right
[21:15] the disciples stopping there where we
[21:20] was talking about the disciples those
[21:25] that Paul and Peter them begin to teach
[21:29] the church how to come to the statute of
[21:31] a perfect man or to the faith of the
[21:34] fathers they had and remember what the
[21:37] scripture says were built on the
[21:39] foundation of próximas prophets Jesus
[21:41] Christ being the chief Cornerstone all
[21:43] right Jesus had laid that word down
[21:48] but in Matthew 24 he did not explain
[21:51] what are you talking about those seals
[21:53] were written in Matthew 24 code it ain't
[21:55] me in addition to the Word of God they
[21:57] were written to her but nobody's eyes it
[21:59] and had never been unveil to anyone
[22:01] other than him he stood there being the
[22:05] pure unadulterated Word all right now
[22:08] but when those disciples so follow you
[22:13] where are you going now
[22:15] John introduced Jesus Jesus preached the
[22:20] message here comes the disciples now the
[22:22] disciples have got a message they've got
[22:26] a message it's called the faith of the
[22:29] fathers that was their message we're
[22:31] built on that foundation apostles and
[22:33] prophets all right it was what Peter and
[22:37] him say it
[22:40] you think carnal about what I speak a
[22:43] lot of time but you know what where the
[22:46] Bible said repent everyone to be
[22:47] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[22:48] from mission of sin you know that was
[22:49] one of the Apostles that said that which
[22:51] was Peter now you ain't going like this
[22:55] but you know if Peter has said repent
[22:57] and stand on your head
[23:01] you know what for anybody to get to Holy
[23:04] Ghost they would have had to done that
[23:07] because Peter was the spokesman he was
[23:11] the one to tell what to do so that said
[23:14] men and brethren what must we do he said
[23:17] repent every one of you be baptized in
[23:19] the name of Jesus Christ why because his
[23:21] church is built on the revelation of
[23:22] Jesus Christ
[23:23] right don't ever forget it it never left
[23:25] that revelation but those disciples now
[23:28] when they brought that message us
[23:30] teaching the statue of a perfect man
[23:31] they brought together a people a people
[23:36] flew gathered up from that of where the
[23:40] disciples were preaching and all anybody
[23:43] getting it something then it brought
[23:45] forth the book of Acts right the axe is
[23:51] axe to the Holy Ghost in the church will
[23:53] see the church started on to their
[23:55] Pentecost in the book of Acts all right
[23:58] now and as it did did you catch what I'm
[24:03] talking about see thin window that
[24:05] church preaching the faith of the
[24:07] fathers you know here comes Paul going
[24:11] to the backside of the desert comes out
[24:13] of there preaches the same thing that
[24:17] Paul that Peter and him preached that's
[24:20] what your prophet said no he said there
[24:22] was no way country and nothing well he
[24:23] said Peter just wouldn't behaving
[24:25] himself with her when they got to the
[24:26] problem but he said there was no
[24:28] different so whatever Peter wouldn't you
[24:31] remember I kept emphasizing that here
[24:32] all but Peter preached the stature of a
[24:34] perfect man Paul called an adoption but
[24:37] it's the same identical point adoption
[24:42] and the statute of perfect land it's the
[24:44] same point or thought
[24:48] so out of that book of Acts now think
[24:53] about this and you'll see what happens
[24:54] down through time how do their comes out
[24:58] of those apostles with the faith of us
[25:00] out of their walk the Apostle Paul in
[25:05] the book of Acts right he was in the
[25:10] book of Acts he was that with him and
[25:14] trying his best to be with it with the
[25:16] Jews but he found out he couldn't do it
[25:20] so he said lo I turn to the gentle house
[25:24] he knew he had to move on alright and as
[25:30] the book of Acts the Prophet said begin
[25:32] to dwindle down and watch the point
[25:36] listen as if they begin to kind of get
[25:39] settled in their ways and going into
[25:42] doctrines and ideas and thought he said
[25:45] to people begin to cry out
[25:49] and God answered that those people with
[25:53] a man called the Apostle Paul with a
[25:57] message to the first church age
[26:02] Paul came as Pentecost was dwindling
[26:06] away now what was the church age
[26:09] messenger to do what's he do
[26:10] first he rebukes the previous age right
[26:13] now come on I can get these for you I've
[26:16] got parts of it he rebukes the previous
[26:19] age and said then he brings the message
[26:21] to his age
[26:22] we'll see Paul rebuked the people for
[26:26] getting away from Pentecost are at
[26:28] Pentecost as Pentecost was winding down
[26:33] remember the Prophet says ever messenger
[26:38] I'm gonna read them they'll in here ever
[26:41] messenger every point of them came at
[26:43] the end of the age
[26:45] choices Pentecost was dwindling down
[26:48] here comes the Apostle Paul you know
[26:50] what he was he was the answer of God to
[26:54] what was needed just like Moses they
[26:57] begin to cry out and what did God do he
[27:01] said Moses sure there was a lot of
[27:03] troubles up and down but still he was
[27:05] Moses and still he come back and brought
[27:07] the people out
[27:11] see then you see the ages this is the
[27:14] start
[27:16] there's the Apostle Paul bringing his
[27:19] message now I'd ask you to do it I'm
[27:21] thinking on it so if I do it forgive me
[27:24] I may do it I wished you'd read every
[27:27] church age and first pick up that
[27:30] thought of the rebuke and then get the
[27:35] part of what's going on but just
[27:37] remember a key in there all of that
[27:42] rebuke is not the bride being rebuked
[27:45] he's rebuking everything the bride is
[27:50] caught in there because she's leaving
[27:51] her first love is that the first church
[27:53] age message because diets left thy first
[27:56] love me to the bride it doesn't matter
[28:00] about the rest of them rest of them
[28:02] hadn't had no first love
[28:03] so they hadn't lost no first love who's
[28:07] the bride the here comes Paul walking
[28:11] out there and brains the Macy's remember
[28:14] messenger always come to into the age
[28:17] lorentz that always comes into the age
[28:20] you put Paul at the end of of Ephesus
[28:23] and and he'd be the messengerís to from
[28:27] mertha that ain't even sensible you
[28:30] can't put it together be sensible any of
[28:33] your own thinking the messenger comes to
[28:36] the end of the age we got the quotes Lyn
[28:37] here I've read them to you over and over
[28:41] and showing that we're right where we're
[28:44] standing
[28:45] seeing that messenger as he comes to the
[28:47] to the dying away of the previous age or
[28:51] thought or people so the Apostle Paul
[28:54] rebuked them the Pentecostal people or
[28:56] you know the book of Acts people and as
[28:59] he did he brought his message to the
[29:01] first church age
[29:04] all right then that would be the former
[29:07] rain to the first church st. Paul's
[29:10] message all right the people became what
[29:14] Paul preached then made it's been a
[29:18] handful wouldn't were twelve in the book
[29:21] of Ephesus that ain't got none to do
[29:23] with how many are don't worry about that
[29:25] well they missed a few don't worry about
[29:27] a few all it takes is God in one all
[29:31] right
[29:32] but around said if God can get one mile
[29:35] how many to say he said one or two or
[29:38] was it just one man in his hands one
[29:41] that's all he needs all right listen
[29:45] see read the church ages we may just
[29:49] take them and just read the ages and
[29:52] just see what the rebuke is see what
[29:54] happens in an age and see what is given
[29:56] to the people of that age cause remember
[29:58] one time
[29:59] I'm telling it the best I can say it
[30:04] John introduced Jesus he was the word
[30:08] Jesus introduces the Southwest they were
[30:11] the word the disciples come forth and
[30:13] they introduced the faith of the fathers
[30:16] and Paul walks out he was the word now
[30:18] watch my point out of the age the prior
[30:22] age or the age of it begins the end out
[30:25] of that age the bride listen the bride I
[30:30] don't know what's the best word to say a
[30:32] birth is a pretty good word ah rejects
[30:35] is a pretty good word but out of that
[30:38] first age you realize what it done that
[30:41] first age that those disciples had and
[30:44] Paul's message to them you know what it
[30:47] done it gave birth to Iranians it gave
[30:55] birth to the next church age and the
[30:56] messenger to come then you've got your
[31:02] pattern said Paul as he delivered that
[31:06] message then the people became the
[31:08] message and they were the latter rain to
[31:11] the former that he had brought in other
[31:13] words they were his message made alive
[31:15] the Living Word and out of that Living
[31:20] Word may have taken a while for it to
[31:23] happen
[31:25] I don't know how long it was between
[31:27] Paul and Iranians they ain't got nothing
[31:30] to do with it so you do that and then
[31:32] you're running your brain we're gonna be
[31:34] other what I can't be because of the
[31:35] essence about a thousand years in here
[31:37] what does that got to do with it that
[31:40] early church had to face of the fathers
[31:42] your prophet said it like stood for the
[31:45] first for ages I didn't say it he said
[31:51] it went that far the pure unadulterated
[31:52] word lasted the first for ages now you
[31:56] argue with him about it but listen then
[31:59] as it did what happened me that church
[32:05] age as the book of Acts gave birth to
[32:08] Paul is that okay to use it
[32:12] our brought out our our delivered out of
[32:17] them
[32:18] a man from what from the original word
[32:21] they were standing home Paul didn't walk
[32:23] out on something his own he stood on
[32:26] what the disciples said because they had
[32:29] to face of the fathers he was part of
[32:32] that so he believed what they talked and
[32:36] he walked out on believing it all right
[32:38] see then as the church age started dying
[32:40] down the people began to cry out for a
[32:42] deliverer may have been a hundred two
[32:44] hundred years between Paul and Iranians
[32:46] I don't know I didn't look at the ages
[32:47] of you do that
[32:51] but out of that cry for a deliverer
[32:54] walked a man a man called Iranians the
[33:02] messenger of the day he walked right out
[33:07] of what Paul did him had talked he could
[33:11] put everything he had back at the book
[33:13] of Acts little Branham tells you about
[33:17] Arrhenius you remember remember how he
[33:20] brought it you remember he really was
[33:22] dealing with Polycarp as being the first
[33:25] Church I mean the second messenger but
[33:28] random was actually dealing this gonna
[33:30] preach Polycarp and the Holy Spirit
[33:32] straighten him out
[33:33] he said Polycarp lend a little bit to
[33:35] organized religion
[33:37] he said Iranians didn't so you'd get the
[33:41] point what I'm saying he couldn't bring
[33:44] Polycarp out to be the messenger Iranian
[33:51] swapped out at the ending up of Paul
[33:56] Dage I rainiest walk out and as he did
[34:02] he brought a message there's you former
[34:04] right well you say what's his medic
[34:09] read to church ages
[34:12] come on if you want to know what is
[34:17] happening pause message to the first
[34:19] church hey why don't you read the
[34:21] message that the angel give to him
[34:25] read the first church age that's what
[34:29] God was dealing with read the second
[34:32] church age that's what God was dealing
[34:34] with but Iranians had stepped on the
[34:36] scene
[34:39] and he said he began to bring the word
[34:41] and the people watch now the people
[34:44] became what i reneus said the people
[34:50] becoming what Irena said there's a lot
[34:52] of rainfall in your former to quicken
[34:56] that and make it a living word Lai stood
[35:00] I don't know how long you could go back
[35:01] and get them out of ages in a some of
[35:03] them lasted 100 of years or someone
[35:04] longer whatever 200 it lasted a pretty
[35:07] good little bit see they were still
[35:09] under the faith of the fathers until the
[35:12] fourth church age now we do how the
[35:13] prophets word on that
[35:14] he said the pure unadulterated word
[35:16] likes it first 4:8 so hot now that don't
[35:20] mean everybody believes it that don't
[35:22] matter to me whether they wouldn't but
[35:23] one believed
[35:26] but you see when Iranians brought his
[35:28] message and the people begin to make
[35:30] that alive in the Living Word then his
[35:33] time went on it began to dwindle down
[35:36] and some of those people of Iranian
[35:38] serve age or time that remembered the
[35:41] truth begin to cry out
[35:45] let's get back to what Iranians talk and
[35:50] as they did God sent a messenger Saint
[35:55] Martin Martin walked right out of what
[36:01] Iranians was teaching he believed what
[36:04] Iranians talk
[36:07] and stood up on it because the new
[36:10] Iranian stood on what Paul taught and
[36:12] Paul stood on what Peter and all the
[36:13] rest of them though and Peter named note
[36:15] the Lord Jesus touted and John the
[36:18] Baptist could stand back her and say
[36:19] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[36:20] the sin of the world you know he was
[36:22] right he didn't introduce something that
[36:26] wasn't right
[36:27] his message was thus sayeth the Lord
[36:31] right but do you get what I'm going to
[36:34] try the brain see then when Martin walks
[36:37] out upon that what the 3rd church age if
[36:40] I get him out in the order you just put
[36:42] it in this liquor I hear behind it
[36:44] Martin walked out desire with a pure
[36:49] unadulterated word till Brett around him
[36:51] even said it he said to Paul that Martin
[36:53] was the greatest
[36:55] let's see now I get the wording correct
[36:58] he said that Martin was the greatest
[37:01] except the Lord Jesus
[37:03] now there's something like that there's
[37:05] a the thought is dire in other words
[37:06] Martin standing there was the closest to
[37:10] the Lord Jesus that brother branham
[37:12] could see because that's what he was
[37:14] bringing out the point I'll find it for
[37:16] you
[37:18] he said there was a they was healing and
[37:20] ever service and things in the days of
[37:22] Martin he wasn't satisfied till all that
[37:25] was doing some of those who was which
[37:27] one was the one that was tied onto the
[37:28] tree and that was leaning up you know
[37:31] was supposed to killed him and and they
[37:33] cut the tree down that fell on the
[37:34] people that was tied up to the tree you
[37:37] got all those miracles happening but see
[37:43] Martin brought a message read it in the
[37:46] Bible the third church age he brought a
[37:48] message unto the angel of the churches
[37:51] summer or into the angel the churches
[37:53] started under the right you will see if
[37:59] I get back to it and can bring it enough
[38:01] you'll see that those ages exactly
[38:03] produced what's he saying but Martin
[38:08] Luther brought his message that was
[38:10] former right teaching right pouring the
[38:15] word in God was quicker than it making
[38:18] it alive he became alive in those
[38:21] disciples
[38:23] and they then was a latter rain why
[38:27] because they were the living word so
[38:29] your thought says no there was no
[38:31] rapture back there well how are they
[38:36] gonna get in the rat sure if there was
[38:39] no rapture back door would you explain
[38:42] that
[38:44] because I've told you from day one the
[38:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the closest
[38:49] thing there is to a change of the body
[38:51] and a rapture if you don't have the
[38:54] baptism of the Holy go you ain't going
[38:56] to be in the rapture the rapture
[39:02] starting today you've got the new birth
[39:06] so when each one of them got the new
[39:08] birth that put inside of them what would
[39:10] take them come on so Martin Luther or
[39:15] Martin excuse me Martin brought his
[39:17] message and as he did the people became
[39:21] the message now watch what I'm saying
[39:25] to prove they became the message Columba
[39:28] walked right out of Martin's message
[39:30] from the people executive Jackie you got
[39:35] a hundred or two hundred years from
[39:37] Martin to Columbo
[39:38] so they were still a bunch of people
[39:40] that believe the Word of God and Columbo
[39:43] walked right out of their error how you
[39:45] put a combo come some different ways to
[39:47] pronounce out of there Walt
[39:51] the messenger of what to force her
[39:54] change and as he did he had a message to
[40:00] Brian which was the former Ryan the
[40:04] teaching rang he taught his message and
[40:08] the people become what he taught and if
[40:10] they become what he told they become the
[40:13] alive word the alive word and as they
[40:22] did when we get to the ages and it take
[40:23] though the ages
[40:25] and see what they produced what you see
[40:32] that didn't end it all because it had to
[40:33] be more to come
[40:34] remember what I taught from the
[40:37] beginning on three or four eight
[40:38] messages ago if you can never find a
[40:41] former rang don't you worry about it
[40:43] they've got to be a letter I they no
[40:45] such thing is coming to former raining
[40:47] and ain't no ladder I know I see it the
[40:49] devil's even got that the devil has his
[40:51] teaching right and he has his ladder
[40:54] right
[40:55] so don't thank this because you said
[40:57] well now they stopped no I didn't stop
[40:59] nowhere cuz here's where you're gonna
[41:00] lose out because Martin then Columba
[41:05] Columbus I stood it was right in a
[41:07] thousand years between Columbia and I'm
[41:10] not exactly to the point where between
[41:12] Columbia and Martin Luther was right
[41:15] onto a thousand years of the dark ages
[41:18] the old cankerworm pom worm locust and
[41:21] the caterpillar had eat the church down
[41:24] to a stump but remember it couldn't eat
[41:29] away the stump because jesus said upon
[41:32] this rock I'll build my church and the
[41:35] gates of Hell cannot prevail against it
[41:39] all right so there was no way that it
[41:43] could be a totally down and here comes a
[41:46] little old man of Martin Luther that we
[41:48] don't think much about but Martin Luther
[41:50] must have been a Christian or something
[41:52] you know he was a preacher and you know
[41:56] he was in the monastery he was in all
[41:57] osa he must have been a Christian of
[42:00] some form I don't think they would have
[42:04] let him be up there preaching if he had
[42:06] to claim some new birth
[42:09] well I only had with justification you
[42:12] just remember one thing and don't you
[42:14] ever forget it Martin Luther's
[42:16] justification did put him in the body of
[42:18] Christ now if you want to leave him out
[42:22] you go ahead and do what you want to
[42:24] that's between you and God but Martin
[42:27] Luther was in the body of Christ it's
[42:28] like anybody else because it was the
[42:30] Holy Ghost in every age what did Martin
[42:32] Luther have the Holy Ghost
[42:35] but run said maybe not in the measure of
[42:38] this age but they had it but out of
[42:41] there come Martin Luther and why did it
[42:45] come out for because the people begin to
[42:48] cry out for a deliverer and God answered
[42:52] that cry with a man called Martin Luther
[42:58] there was a Catholic in the monasteries
[43:01] and doing all those things and get a
[43:06] desire and his heart began to raise up
[43:09] don't you think he studied the Word of
[43:11] God you know by the time that Martin
[43:15] Luther had come on the scene they had by
[43:17] then the writings of all of the Apostles
[43:19] brought into view because you're coming
[43:22] on to what thirteen fourteen fifteen
[43:25] hundred and you already had books you
[43:28] already had the the Wycliffe and the
[43:33] different ones that come forth and who
[43:36] edit the German that there was a lot of
[43:40] them that Haller already even by the
[43:41] time Luther come along
[43:43] you already had Bibles
[43:49] somewhere right in that period of time
[43:51] you picking up the Bible well Martin
[43:54] Luther was studying the Bible you know
[44:00] what he found he had probably read the
[44:05] book of Romans a thousand times he'd
[44:09] probably make commentaries on the book
[44:11] of Romans
[44:12] he'd probably spoke all over the land of
[44:14] the book of Romans the one day he looked
[44:17] down and he said the just shall live by
[44:25] faith and they said he wrote but I got
[44:29] it on my Bible said he wrote the just
[44:32] shall live by faith alone because it was
[44:36] revealed to it
[44:38] what his message was revealed what was
[44:41] Martin Luther's message the just shall
[44:43] live by faith
[44:46] does it form of rain sure they had a lot
[44:52] of problems in it but out of that came a
[44:54] group of people that believed it put the
[44:57] Bible and all into the hands of man
[44:59] coming on over to the time of getting
[45:02] everything set to work that the Bible
[45:04] could be brought to the to the common
[45:06] people to where they could read it what
[45:10] a wonderful age it was of the age of
[45:12] Martin Luther
[45:15] we get you here people in this message
[45:17] say there didn't help nothing whets with
[45:21] him did how none seen even Pentecost was
[45:23] false but you know people swear but
[45:31] those people's word go ahead but you see
[45:39] Martin Luther as I emphasized he was
[45:45] already a credited Christian and out of
[45:51] there came the just shall live by faith
[45:55] he brought that message in the people
[46:00] became that message and they became that
[46:02] message they became the latter rain to
[46:04] the former right in other words they
[46:07] became the alive word oh I don't believe
[46:10] in feedback that was a live word well
[46:12] what are you
[46:15] they don't play with me with quotes I'm
[46:19] too old I'm sorry I know I'm hateful
[46:21] arrogant and everything the world but I
[46:24] can't help being what I am I can read
[46:27] and believe it
[46:30] brother branham referring to the Zeus
[46:31] retreat penticoff he said one day on the
[46:34] Nexen he said they were closer to the
[46:36] coming of the Lord than we are
[46:39] oh you don't want to hear that what'd
[46:47] you see he was telling it like it is
[46:51] Martin Luther and then they begin to get
[46:54] to word into man's hands and think you
[46:56] know to translate it to bring it down
[46:58] and we finally got the King James
[46:59] Version but you see that lie stood for a
[47:05] hundred years or so and the people begin
[47:10] to cry because they seen the people
[47:13] getting away from Luther's message you
[47:18] know in the beginning of Luther's
[47:19] message you know they really believed
[47:20] his message so much you know what they'd
[47:22] done that's wait about it he he brought
[47:24] it out here while by you know what those
[47:26] Lutheran's done I mean just a little
[47:29] what I have - Luther brought his message
[47:30] on you want you to they burnt down the
[47:32] churches inside because they believe
[47:35] that's what Luther was saying Luther
[47:38] says no I've read his own writing where
[47:41] he said I did not want to leave the
[47:43] Catholic Church
[47:44] I wanted to reform it
[47:54] it's kind of funny Nene writes a thesis
[47:57] to do away with some of the doctrines
[48:00] they had and still cures the Catholic
[48:04] cross in baptizes in Father Son and Holy
[48:07] Ghost and the Holy Mary and all of these
[48:10] things
[48:12] that's where people can't follow that
[48:14] and believe me that was a man of God
[48:16] well what are you you better remember
[48:21] where you came from that's one thing
[48:23] I've always said I know where I came
[48:26] from and I know the doctrine I came from
[48:34] but a lot of you said well I didn't know
[48:36] what that doctrine was that dire no
[48:38] because you don't know what the doctrine
[48:41] is now
[48:45] you don't know the truth you won't
[48:47] listen to it you won't follow it like I
[48:54] said the other day I asked you reach
[48:56] forward and regional scene Sunday I said
[48:58] raise your hand probably 10 people in
[49:00] the building raise your hand
[49:01] I ain't raising my hand cuz I ain't no
[49:03] big show-off now your brother now you
[49:08] can call it anything else see I just
[49:12] asked you to where you can tell to see
[49:14] that that at least like one brother said
[49:16] there's one thing about brother tail I
[49:18] got a note in this recently from brother
[49:20] he said that's one thing about it he
[49:22] said they can't nobody argue about what
[49:23] you saying they've caused you reading it
[49:26] I said well thank God for that
[49:29] at least I'm reading it it ain't up to
[49:33] me to quicken it anyway but listen
[49:36] Church you realize what I'm talking
[49:38] about
[49:39] where did whit Wesley come from come on
[49:49] 100-200 years between Lutheran with
[49:51] where do Wesley come from you know what
[49:54] Wesley was he was a Lutheran you said
[49:58] whoa what do you mean I mean he was
[50:02] convert under the Lutheran ideas and
[50:05] couldn't concept what caught what was he
[50:08] under Wesley wasn't under that already a
[50:14] preacher in England that half of his
[50:17] family was preachers he goes to America
[50:23] to preach to the Indians on the way he
[50:26] meets the Moravians River how you
[50:27] pronounce it and they teach him the
[50:29] doctrine of sanctification because as
[50:32] the ship was sinking and doing bumping
[50:34] in the water they were out there saying
[50:36] in like everything you know wasn't
[50:38] scared of nothing he seen they had
[50:40] something and he said I came to America
[50:44] convert the Indian he said lo I found
[50:46] out I needed to be converted and what
[50:49] happened
[50:51] Wesley stepped out with sanctification
[50:54] ii work sanctification which is part of
[50:59] the word of god whether you like it or
[51:01] not what you see Wesley then brought a
[51:05] message of sanctification swept the
[51:09] world with the doctrine of
[51:10] sanctification most all of your songs if
[51:13] you're looking at them and listen to
[51:15] your words or your songs that you were
[51:17] singing I know it was the blood I know
[51:20] it was the blood both of them was
[51:22] written during been Wesley's period and
[51:25] you know what they were believing that
[51:27] you were saved by the blood that's what
[51:29] brother I've said now I didn't say it he
[51:31] said they believed they were saved by
[51:32] the blood he said you're not saved by
[51:34] the blood he said now if you're gonna do
[51:36] anything he was kept safe by and said
[51:38] you would incite by and he said you're
[51:40] saved by grace through faith would you
[51:44] see what I'm talking about
[51:45] Luther actually expelled or pushed out
[51:48] from him and his message walk out of
[51:51] that message a man that was believed in
[51:53] Luther's message walked out and became a
[51:56] messenger to the 6-2 change
[52:02] and he began to preach sanctification
[52:04] and the people began to come to that he
[52:13] was teaching sanctification better than
[52:14] what you think he was now I've got his
[52:17] rotten at the house of you and read it
[52:18] he said that his message of
[52:20] sanctification was that sanctification
[52:22] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[52:25] new that's Wesley's words that the
[52:28] message of sanctification was the
[52:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:32] you know ha that's right it was for the
[52:35] time but you see then it goes on Gretton
[52:43] realize now it goes on the people of
[52:47] that day become what Wesley taught and
[52:49] for hundreds of years that held on
[52:53] brother Brown said there was a little
[52:55] strand all the way down through there
[52:58] the worth of true believers stayed with
[53:00] the word a little straight line with it
[53:03] they stayed with that word they believed
[53:07] what Martin Luther taught they believed
[53:09] what John Wesley taught and what he
[53:12] brought around the state then the
[53:13] one-eyed black man he said in a couple
[53:16] of hobos
[53:17] I've got him laying here run sit in a
[53:19] couple of hobos he said the people begin
[53:24] to cry out said they felt along and they
[53:26] began to cry out for deliverance and
[53:29] said God come on the scene and delivered
[53:32] that message to them and brought to them
[53:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:39] and the message of the gifts but you say
[53:44] that to most of people that's message
[53:46] they'll run you out of the church if you
[53:48] say the Zeus of street Pentecostal
[53:49] people had to baptism in the Holy Ghost
[53:51] brother Branham said to head to baptism
[53:53] when hole goes just like the book of
[53:54] Acts
[53:54] now you argue with him no you're not
[53:58] going to argue with him you just ain't
[53:59] gonna believe it well I just can't see
[54:02] that
[54:04] I didn't ask you to see it I asked you
[54:07] to thank God for truth because where
[54:10] would we be today had it not been for
[54:12] Luther Wesley and Pentecost you realize
[54:16] you would have had a vast gap in between
[54:17] now with nothing is that what you're
[54:20] teaching
[54:20] yeah but brother saw it so came free
[54:23] share and he said that right he did
[54:25] right here in this church and I told him
[54:27] it was wrong
[54:30] but I ain't gonna back up and I want to
[54:34] argue with nobody but I ain't gonna back
[54:35] up when it comes to the word cuz I've
[54:40] told you about it we've set in one day
[54:41] and a couple of brothers and we're
[54:43] talking about we're brother Brown said
[54:44] that says the church had received the
[54:47] baptism in the Holy Ghost just like the
[54:48] day of Pentecost one of them said well
[54:52] we ain't got it yet and the other one
[54:54] said I don't had that all along I said
[54:56] would you two mind if I just stay in the
[54:58] middle cuz I can't go need one either
[55:00] one of you and that's when I tried my
[55:03] best to explain it that on the day of
[55:05] Pentecost you had a hundred and twenty
[55:08] in the upper room that when they
[55:10] received the new birth it was right here
[55:12] at Holy Spirit but the 3,000 later and
[55:15] everybody from then on got the new
[55:18] birthday faith a baby in Christ I've
[55:21] talked to at 40 years and I mean backing
[55:23] all for nothing you say you were you're
[55:26] gonna run us off listen Church I cry and
[55:32] pray for you every day if you're gonna
[55:34] get up and walk out just remember you're
[55:35] walking out over my tears and I pray for
[55:39] God to help you to open to see the word
[55:41] my family and everything that's all I've
[55:46] ever tried to do is preach the Word of
[55:47] God I know you don't like my ways and
[55:50] ideas that's all right
[55:51] I don't like yours but what's that got
[55:55] to do with it
[55:57] come on Church but see from that little
[56:01] group of Martin Luther that held on to
[56:06] the word for a hundred or two hundred
[56:08] years they begin to cry out and God
[56:11] brought a man named John Wesley Wesley
[56:15] brought his message of sanctification
[56:17] for Moraine teaching rain
[56:22] the people became what Martin loop of
[56:24] what John Wesley taught and as they did
[56:26] they became the latter rain to what he
[56:28] was teaching which was the alive word
[56:31] are a harvest you realize they've got it
[56:35] to demanded it the people that walked
[56:37] out our own Wesley's message if God had
[56:39] demanded right then to end it all on
[56:41] counter you know there wouldn't been
[56:43] nobody else but he took to him because
[56:45] they did have the new birth they had to
[56:49] baptism with the Holy Ghost and out of
[56:52] that becomes that one eyed black man
[56:54] that brother Branham said he was the
[56:55] messenger to the aged he said I would
[56:58] not to mention her to lady you'll see it
[57:00] he said because I you can't be but
[57:03] around him wasn't the messenger the lady
[57:04] will seal you so who was that around
[57:07] tells you who was he said to one eyed
[57:10] black man brought the message and he
[57:16] said God answered the plea of the people
[57:19] and gave them the restoration of the
[57:22] gifts and he said and brought to them
[57:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:31] do you believe that do you really
[57:36] believe that that he brought to them
[57:39] that
[57:45] if you can pick it up with me we'll pick
[57:47] up the number five we run around on
[57:50] Feast of the trumpets said now if I come
[57:52] with a message of Pentecost I would be
[57:58] in the lady you see in church age
[58:02] and I wouldn't and it wouldn't be right
[58:07] but around was not to messenger the lady
[58:10] of Steel oh we got the drawings we've
[58:12] had this drawings brother branham done
[58:14] this drawing showed it everybody it's
[58:16] got to fit in there because remember he
[58:17] had two things he had to turn the hearts
[58:22] of the children back and then he has to
[58:23] bring the sails he's got two things
[58:27] yeah look at the next one gods only
[58:31] provide a place of worship he said in
[58:34] Pentecostals that brother when I believe
[58:36] one with the eyes was out a colored
[58:39] brother who really started the
[58:42] Pentecostal message in California old
[58:45] Azusa Street he was like that because he
[58:49] was a Negro he was made fun of but he
[58:52] brought a message for that age
[59:02] witnesses number seven 350 years ago a
[59:07] one-eyed colored man humble in his heart
[59:11] with no education along with a group of
[59:14] faithful Saints waited younger on the
[59:18] zoo Street until the power of God fell
[59:22] from heaven has a witness that God in
[59:25] the last days had poured out his Holy
[59:28] Spirit upon the Western world it caused
[59:31] a great revival you know yourself if
[59:35] you've ever studied the message for the
[59:37] Brennan Center Azusa Street with the
[59:38] lice great moving revival of that way
[59:45] you said yeah but you talk about having
[59:48] a revival individuals individuals have a
[59:52] revival in this day the next one will we
[59:55] need two witnesses to Israel
[1:00:00] come on but listen
[1:00:08] I love this because I've always quote
[1:00:10] this one but listen I've always quote
[1:00:12] this now but I don't never finish it
[1:00:13] that's pretty good of me anyway
[1:00:15] go to number ten I was looking at issue
[1:00:18] then I thought hey I'd better read what
[1:00:19] this more of it so go to number ten this
[1:00:22] is one a lot of you don't like me to
[1:00:24] read that's alright I love to read it
[1:00:25] already 50 years sorry screaming now
[1:00:29] this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:00:30] revelations 10 7 so now he's gonna do
[1:00:34] two things don't turn the hearts back in
[1:00:36] the sevens gonna bring the seals right
[1:00:39] is that right now it's going to do two
[1:00:43] things one according to Malachi 4 he'll
[1:00:45] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:00:46] father's 2 he will reveal the mysteries
[1:00:48] of the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[1:00:51] which are the revelation contained in
[1:00:52] the seven seals it will be these
[1:00:54] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:00:56] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:00:58] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:01:00] exactly so now what this prophet
[1:01:07] messenger will be him but he says but
[1:01:10] consider this also know what see this
[1:01:13] prophet messenger will be in his nature
[1:01:15] in manners as were Elijah and John the
[1:01:19] people of this prophet messengers of day
[1:01:21] will be as they were in a halfs day and
[1:01:24] in John's and since it is only the
[1:01:28] children whose hearts will be turned it
[1:01:33] is only the children who will listen I
[1:01:37] like that order been reading that the
[1:01:40] whole time ok next time I quote it was
[1:01:42] remember is that
[1:01:44] what do you see what I'm talking about
[1:01:48] Azusa Street you know the bread around
[1:01:52] them said it do you won't keep reading
[1:01:55] Azusa Street
[1:02:05] I'm going to read around and said no
[1:02:09] messenger to the age because the Holy
[1:02:12] Ghost came himself it's in this seal
[1:02:16] first sealed I know that you know let's
[1:02:21] see if I can find it I got it here hold
[1:02:24] on okay it's really number two which is
[1:02:30] questions and answers on the sea you see
[1:02:32] each one of those ages only taking the
[1:02:34] dip into the Holy Spirit justification
[1:02:36] is working the Holy Spirit
[1:02:37] sanctification is work of the Holy
[1:02:39] Spirit but the baptism is the Holy
[1:02:41] Spirit that's the reason it took a
[1:02:42] prophetic prophet to come down no
[1:02:44] messenger to the age
[1:02:49] no man no messenger he didn't say the
[1:02:54] Holy Ghost didn't come on because the
[1:02:57] Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness
[1:02:59] of the baptism Zeus's treat somebody
[1:03:04] tells you they didn't how the Holy Ghost
[1:03:05] back there
[1:03:06] you tell them they're lying because
[1:03:08] brother around and said you did that
[1:03:12] once because the Holy Ghost came in self
[1:03:15] in the fullness of the Baptist but at
[1:03:16] the end of the age and it always ends
[1:03:18] upon the others we find in dar the
[1:03:20] messenger sin and all these scruples and
[1:03:23] things are to be placed in their places
[1:03:25] like that then the rapture comes to the
[1:03:28] church no messenger to the lady will see
[1:03:31] an age because the Holy Ghost came
[1:03:33] himself
[1:03:36] holy ghost was a messenger to ever
[1:03:38] church age you don't make no difference
[1:03:40] now where's Powell Iranians John I mean
[1:03:42] what he was a messenger to all of them
[1:03:44] it is the Holy Ghost in every age or
[1:03:48] what you see brother branham comes along
[1:03:53] see out of that little group
[1:03:56] he said they immediately call showing
[1:03:59] that it would be a quick quick short
[1:04:01] work our age he said immediately they
[1:04:04] started drawing up their doctrines
[1:04:05] increased he said even before the second
[1:04:07] generation you know I need to always
[1:04:08] talk first generation stays pretty good
[1:04:10] second generation goes to what he says
[1:04:12] in one quote he said the fact that they
[1:04:15] they didn't wait till the second
[1:04:16] generation
[1:04:17] he said started writing their own creeds
[1:04:19] and I and then you see brother Branham
[1:04:21] coming out know who's brother branham
[1:04:23] rebuking brother Brown was rebuking the
[1:04:27] Pentecost was for getting away from the
[1:04:29] message right he rebuked the Baptist he
[1:04:32] rebuked everybody
[1:04:34] you see Church we won't listen to him
[1:04:39] you know that brother branham said one
[1:04:42] day like this he's talking about the
[1:04:45] Baptist he said you better leave him
[1:04:48] alone he's because they know the word
[1:04:52] but see they didn't have the spirit to
[1:04:54] go with it right so they just went with
[1:04:57] their own letter of the word but they
[1:05:01] had to word remember that's where he
[1:05:03] came from whether you like it or not he
[1:05:07] came out of the Baptist Church
[1:05:09] oh that's contrary to this quote over
[1:05:12] here to where it says no prophet ever
[1:05:14] come out of a church age he didn't come
[1:05:16] out of the church age you want me to
[1:05:18] prove it to you I'll find it for you
[1:05:21] about 19 and 58 or 59 brother Brennan
[1:05:26] said the Baptist just now become a
[1:05:29] denomination you don't that quote the
[1:05:34] Baptist's just now become a denominator
[1:05:36] there's a denominator over a hundred
[1:05:37] years for the N right as far as what we
[1:05:39] think what's he talking about you
[1:05:43] realized that when that prophet stepped
[1:05:45] on the scene nobody could stand before
[1:05:50] him and he rebuked the Pentecostals and
[1:05:54] everything prior to them and so you know
[1:05:59] when they become a denomination it's
[1:06:01] when they turned down what he talked the
[1:06:06] Baptist's become a denomination in like
[1:06:08] 58 59 so cuz they turn down what he
[1:06:12] talked
[1:06:15] because you can't stand before a prophet
[1:06:18] nobody can no matter what it is nobody
[1:06:22] extend before profit profit don't stand
[1:06:24] for nobody either he stands before God
[1:06:26] all right so get the point of what we're
[1:06:28] talking about
[1:06:29] Rhoda Branham then as he steps on the
[1:06:31] scene
[1:06:33] forty's Fifty's and all like that he's
[1:06:36] preaching the faith of the fathers
[1:06:39] trying to get the church to turn back to
[1:06:40] that because that's his former right
[1:06:45] that's his former right was teaching
[1:06:48] back to the faith of the fathers who
[1:06:53] would be the latter ain't anybody that
[1:06:54] would take that and believe it and would
[1:06:57] be the alive word
[1:07:05] I hope you get what I said a moment ago
[1:07:07] it seemed to went flat but you see there
[1:07:10] is nobody that was in bad shape until
[1:07:13] brother Branham brought the message of
[1:07:14] the truth because everybody had their
[1:07:17] own points and their own ideas and God
[1:07:20] was winking at ignorance but one day he
[1:07:22] brought a little profit on the scene and
[1:07:24] he quit winking and he said now you've
[1:07:26] denominated and you're dead but you see
[1:07:31] there was a little group of people that
[1:07:34] heard the profit and down through time
[1:07:38] they stuck with it think about yourself
[1:07:43] as being some of them some of your older
[1:07:45] one especially on the internet was that
[1:07:46] that you listen to that prophet you
[1:07:48] believed it sure you had problems and
[1:07:51] troubles because nobody ever talked like
[1:07:52] him but yet you believed it and you know
[1:07:57] out of our was produced a ladder rain
[1:08:01] that a prophet wouldn't just be so
[1:08:03] indifferent for the faith of the fathers
[1:08:06] that his message would come forth you
[1:08:10] say what brother his message yeah his
[1:08:14] message not in the years and preparation
[1:08:18] but when he begins to sound the message
[1:08:21] these mysteries will be revealed and
[1:08:24] then they are not know knowing then and
[1:08:28] the people are a witness of that that's
[1:08:30] from the message trying to do God a
[1:08:31] service without his will all right what
[1:08:35] about it when did the prophets message
[1:08:38] begin well I thought its message begins
[1:08:39] back on part one turn the hearts of the
[1:08:42] children back to the father's the Holy
[1:08:44] Ghost picking up the black man and the
[1:08:45] people and bringing it and the Prophet
[1:08:47] stepping right out of that where did he
[1:08:50] come from
[1:08:57] works his faith Express 1965 pointing to
[1:09:01] this our revelation 10 said that in the
[1:09:04] hour of the seventh angels message when
[1:09:06] he begins to sound forth his message not
[1:09:09] in a healing service but the message
[1:09:11] that follows the heathen healing service
[1:09:13] I have heard but now I see and he
[1:09:15] promised in the hour of the seventh
[1:09:18] angels message the seven seals would be
[1:09:21] revealed and the mysteries of God would
[1:09:23] be declared revelation 2:10 when the
[1:09:25] seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:09:27] message not the healing service the
[1:09:30] message that follows the healing service
[1:09:33] the rapture 1965 and I must say it and
[1:09:39] my message all the time knowing back dar
[1:09:42] under healing and so forth like that was
[1:09:46] just to catch the people's attention
[1:09:48] knowing the message would come and here
[1:09:51] it is and then the seven seals opened
[1:09:55] those mysteries and showed those things
[1:10:02] what about it see now he sold his
[1:10:05] message along with the last of 62 I say
[1:10:10] that because of spoken word reading on C
[1:10:12] because that was when he began to really
[1:10:14] direct and not right either a few days
[1:10:16] four prior to that back you go back to
[1:10:20] is it the serves what time is it in
[1:10:23] other word is it an hour a day
[1:10:25] all right and he starts bringing his
[1:10:27] message
[1:10:28] what is his message from the seals and
[1:10:31] only unto eternal life because this
[1:10:33] messenger would have to stand between
[1:10:34] man and attorney because they not
[1:10:36] another messenger to come he didn't come
[1:10:40] to introduce another messenger he become
[1:10:44] he come to introduce as I quoted at
[1:10:46] Sunday rotor Braun said this man this
[1:10:48] one would be standing pointing to the
[1:10:50] skies that a word born bride who's
[1:10:54] reporting to you and I come on
[1:11:04] questions and answers 1954 Oh brother
[1:11:07] give me a church full of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:08] God will do in one year what all the new
[1:11:13] ologies failed to do in two thousand
[1:11:15] years you wait till the anointing of the
[1:11:18] church really strikes home to that fate
[1:11:21] for the little remnant after the doors
[1:11:24] of the Gentiles is closed
[1:11:25] Oh God will annoy the church then he
[1:11:28] whose filthy let him be filthy he whose
[1:11:31] righteous let him be righteous he's who
[1:11:33] holy let him be holy God will anoint the
[1:11:36] church with the power of God and things
[1:11:38] will be taking place not only that then
[1:11:42] but he's doing it now he's doing it now
[1:11:48] 54 why because there was people back I
[1:11:52] believe in the world you know there was
[1:11:54] people back there that was the alive
[1:11:56] word you want to tell me those old Azusa
[1:11:59] Street wasn't alive word when they
[1:12:01] throwed Rotten Tomatoes at him they
[1:12:03] killed him they beat him they done
[1:12:04] everything in the book with him to try
[1:12:06] to stop him from preaching and they
[1:12:08] couldn't stop when you tell me that
[1:12:10] ain't a living word but listen watch the
[1:12:16] trouble I tried to remember it whenever
[1:12:19] could get it right so go ahead and pull
[1:12:22] up number it'll make a life point look
[1:12:28] number 17 which is we're going to the
[1:12:30] scriptures I gave you and look what it
[1:12:33] says
[1:12:35] you want to know what's wrong you want
[1:12:38] to know why we're here 50 years after
[1:12:39] the profits gone right here is the
[1:12:42] answer right in the Word of God read it
[1:12:51] lift up thine eyes unto the high places
[1:12:54] and see where thou hath not been laying
[1:12:56] with in the ways has now set for them as
[1:13:02] the Arabian in the wilderness and thou
[1:13:05] has polluted a land with thy whoredoms
[1:13:07] and with our wickedness look there for
[1:13:12] the showers have been with holden and
[1:13:16] there have been no latter rain
[1:13:20] and thou hast a horse forehead that
[1:13:24] refuses to be ashamed now if that ain't
[1:13:28] hitting this age I'll pick it up Sunday
[1:13:30] the Lord willing rot from the dark if
[1:13:33] that ain't it you tell me what it is you
[1:13:37] said well you throw it out to everybody
[1:13:39] taught it to me and you what everybody
[1:13:41] else does is their business I'm
[1:13:43] preaching here I don't preach out there
[1:13:44] what's out there if they hear it that's
[1:13:46] fine that's the work that's their
[1:13:48] problem
[1:13:49] they're the ones gonna have to be put up
[1:13:50] with I'm trying to preach it here but we
[1:13:54] ain't had no letter n brother Dale you
[1:13:55] know why cause you got a horse forehead
[1:13:57] oh don't talk like that to me I'll have
[1:14:06] you know will I have you to know I ain't
[1:14:08] backing up the Bible just said it the
[1:14:13] Bible just told you why we had to write
[1:14:15] it right cause you got a horse forehead
[1:14:19] what does that mean a denominational
[1:14:21] horse forehead in other words our own
[1:14:24] ideas and our thoughts enough things
[1:14:26] about the Word of God that is not God's
[1:14:28] Word
[1:14:31] because remember the profit has brought
[1:14:35] his message he brought a former rain
[1:14:41] listen that started with the seals in
[1:14:43] the time and brought his message now if
[1:14:47] it's true what I preached all the way
[1:14:49] down then there's got to be somebody to
[1:14:51] stand on that and become what he taught
[1:14:54] or I've been wrong all the way back from
[1:14:57] John and Jesus now you want to say that
[1:15:01] about me go ahead drop what you see if
[1:15:07] you say that was right down through
[1:15:09] there then you got to say it's right in
[1:15:10] the end
[1:15:12] there's got to be a group of people a
[1:15:15] prophet said under their messenger that
[1:15:19] would be the final voice to the final
[1:15:22] age former and latter right harvest rain
[1:15:31] the prophet called it or he called it
[1:15:32] rapture where we had former and latter
[1:15:42] former and letter then I ended up trying
[1:15:45] my best to explain why it said the two
[1:15:49] former and latter is to be therein jaw
[1:15:52] in the same month it's to be a short
[1:15:55] word quick because that's what it says
[1:15:58] in the original when it said it be a
[1:15:59] short work look it up it says there'll
[1:16:02] be a short word
[1:16:05] in the original translation why because
[1:16:07] he's gonna cut it short in righteousness
[1:16:09] is that the scriptures
[1:16:11] he's gonna bring it forth his
[1:16:13] righteousness to you and I and we're
[1:16:15] gonna have to walk in it I see our days
[1:16:19] of playing and pitter-patter around and
[1:16:21] everything else
[1:16:22] we'd better get rid of it because we're
[1:16:25] in the last days see what you get and I
[1:16:29] listen to former and latter rain just a
[1:16:30] second look with what you get today from
[1:16:36] God it doesn't matter what he's
[1:16:38] revealing what he's revealed one God to
[1:16:40] you maybe it's right now might reveal
[1:16:41] one guard to somebody sitting here you
[1:16:43] know what that is former right but when
[1:16:47] you take that within your heart and it
[1:16:50] becomes truly alive to you and you see
[1:16:54] that it's real there's you later on but
[1:16:58] now you know yourself I try to explain
[1:17:00] it you see something in the Word of God
[1:17:02] right now come on listen you see
[1:17:05] something in the Word of God and it's so
[1:17:06] beautiful I mean it's so simple and you
[1:17:11] walk outside and you say brother I want
[1:17:15] to tell you what was revealed
[1:17:19] I've done about forgot what was revealed
[1:17:22] now is that true you go to try to
[1:17:26] explain it you know why you know why
[1:17:30] it's that away anytime you speak it I'm
[1:17:35] a minister been a pastor all of these
[1:17:37] years
[1:17:37] I know this is true any time you speak
[1:17:40] the Word of God by your word itself it's
[1:17:44] going to blind a lot of people I've
[1:17:50] known that ever since it started that
[1:17:54] literally by me trying to explain it is
[1:17:57] going to blind it well really look like
[1:18:04] you just quit
[1:18:05] I can't I've cried I've prayed I'd love
[1:18:11] to quit there's something down in my
[1:18:14] heart won't let me quit I'll die in this
[1:18:18] pull up here to do something but it
[1:18:19] ain't gonna let me quit why because I
[1:18:22] ain't gonna quit I want to quit I'd like
[1:18:26] to sit down and this get the burden off
[1:18:30] of my heart now I can't do it you don't
[1:18:35] I go hunting I've said a minute ago my
[1:18:42] gun against a tree and me setting there
[1:18:48] praying about you asking hard to help
[1:18:54] you see it would you do me a favor and
[1:19:00] pray that much for me you know would you
[1:19:06] do that much why because we need it what
[1:19:10] you see whatever you get today tomorrow
[1:19:13] you're gonna have to have another word
[1:19:14] now you won't proof of that you get
[1:19:18] something today
[1:19:19] tomorrow's reveal you're gonna you won't
[1:19:22] have to have something to follow that
[1:19:23] now you want me to prove it
[1:19:25] why do you burn the bread when you take
[1:19:28] the communion
[1:19:32] why do you burn the bread a lot of you
[1:19:35] probably don't even know you do what the
[1:19:37] Bible tells you to burn that bread
[1:19:39] before the next day why because we can't
[1:19:43] hold over anything you said what that's
[1:19:47] the Word of God that's right but there's
[1:19:48] more to come
[1:19:50] what you got today is just a former
[1:19:53] tomorrow's a lighter but when it does
[1:19:55] that former becomes lighter you say you
[1:19:57] you're out of the message you get with
[1:19:59] me someday and let's talk I love to talk
[1:20:03] about the Word of God and looking the
[1:20:05] things we read around him say it he'll
[1:20:06] say here comes the form of rain with the
[1:20:09] latter rain on it that's easy to
[1:20:11] understand former rain latter rain
[1:20:14] that's easy to understand but how about
[1:20:17] this one here comes the latter rain with
[1:20:20] the former on it
[1:20:22] Oh
[1:20:30] now you've got another thought because
[1:20:33] you've got former ladder works okay but
[1:20:36] latter form are gonna work but it does
[1:20:40] if you listen what you receive today
[1:20:43] tomorrow's ladder when that day comes it
[1:20:46] becomes former you start over trying to
[1:20:49] explain what you see
[1:20:54] you know yourself you tried to explain
[1:20:56] things to people and you've seen it so
[1:20:58] beautiful and you start trying to
[1:21:00] explain it and you just stand there like
[1:21:02] lord I don't even know what I'm talking
[1:21:04] about I thought I had something in this
[1:21:08] one other I need to go back and read a
[1:21:10] little
[1:21:12] if you ain't never done that you ain't
[1:21:15] never had a good witness yet but you
[1:21:21] know and just keep home cause you know
[1:21:24] watch somebody somebody's going to
[1:21:27] believe it then you know what now here's
[1:21:29] what I hadn't the point ahead and put
[1:21:31] the other so I'm putting it this message
[1:21:33] sorry
[1:21:34] just hold on because what we've got
[1:21:38] maybe for me it may be just teaching
[1:21:42] right but it means it's going to be a
[1:21:45] letter I'm there's going to be a harvest
[1:21:49] because it's a harvest of the
[1:21:51] denomination's the harvest of everything
[1:21:53] there's harvesting the bride there's
[1:21:55] going to be a harvest so hold on just
[1:22:00] hold on until we can get rid of that
[1:22:03] horse forehead how do you get rid of a
[1:22:06] horse forehead by taking the truth and
[1:22:10] let it clean those cobwebs out a horse
[1:22:14] forehead is a contrary doctrine to the
[1:22:16] truth all right he just hold on he ain't
[1:22:22] gonna leave us he started to work the
[1:22:26] Bible said and he'll finish it that's
[1:22:30] why it doesn't bother me that's why it
[1:22:33] doesn't bother me to stand here I sure
[1:22:36] as a human being hey fifty years ago I
[1:22:39] was young man I mean there wasn't no
[1:22:41] such thing as today's work when I was 25
[1:22:45] 27 years of age they wouldn't no such
[1:22:47] thing as today's work

[1:22:54] was it and wading in was building the
[1:22:56] house and I worked at General Motors
