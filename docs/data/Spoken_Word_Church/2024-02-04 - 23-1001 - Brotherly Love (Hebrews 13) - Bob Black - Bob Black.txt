========================================

God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning we're on Hebrews 13 the last chapter and let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning around your word and Lord we've come expecting with expecting hearts Lord Jesus that you'll feed us this morning we just ask Lord that you'll give us the right attitude Lord Jesus and help us Lord to receive these things as we study these things out Lord God lord be with brother Wade as he's prepared and studying and laboring to bring us the word this morning grant us Lord that you'll be at Liberty to move Among Us this morning Lord we pray in your name amen now Hebrews 13 um when we as we kind of get into studying this out there's a lot of uh commentaries online if you people have studied these things and it it's kind of it looks a little bit odd how Paul it seem it would seem like Hebrews 12 is the close out of the book of Hebrews and then then it looks like Hebrews 13 is just kind of he covers a lot of things quickly and just kind of throwing a lot of things out there love one another and remember them that have the rule over you and uh we got to go beyond the camp and all these things kind of thrown out at once and some people say that that it looks like he uh you know um maybe a year or so after he wrote the book of Hebrews he just um he said I'm going to add this on at the end um but either way whatever whatever the case may be um it's part of the book of Hebrews and uh it starts out talking about we need to love one another so this morning I want to I want to just kind of focus on that um he said let brotherly love if we can say that right let Brotherly Love continue and verse two be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares right now there see he's continuing that thought let's be kind to one another be kind to a stranger cuz you never know when that stranger might be an angel somebody that can help you be be be let's let's love and he said remember them that are in bonds remember them that are going through something as though you're bound with them enter into that now see there's where you're really when you begin to enter in to the situations that people are going through and when you're praying you're thinking about them and empathizing with them that's what Paul is talking about and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body so Hebrew 13 we we're just going to talk about brotherly love and continue I I've got this little scripture Leviticus 19:18 Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so that's a promise or or or a an admonition all the way from the Old Testament to love your neighbor as yourself now you think about think about Brotherly Love um when we come to church what's really happening in the life of a Christian as you're hearing the word the word is planted in your life and you got uh you're you're born again and and you know we we've studied these things out that you start off with all the things that are necessary for your journey you got 10 fingers like a little baby 10 toes like a little baby and you begin to grow and grow and grow and push out so maybe your birth you've got you've got some some little bit of of of divine love that can be projected but what we've got to do is grow and grow and grow precept upon precept until it's sealed in so it's constant it's consistent day by day when life throws things at you you're responding with love and kindness in the in the correct way I think honestly this is one of the most difficult things to preach with balance because one of the things you start talking about brotherly love and you go too far over to one side and you're looking at it like well um like a you're looking for a kind old priest which brother BR said we don't want a a kind old priest that can you know maybe help help pay for your bills and and and do those sorts of things but yet won't tell you the truth I I I think kind kindness really if you look at it scripturally and Brotherly Love real Biblical brotherly love is like John the Baptist going out there and saying Herod you can't you you got a marriage situation or somebody telling the truth but so we got to have we got to have the right balance you can't go over on the other side either and say well we just don't need kindness anymore we don't need to treat one another with respect we don't need to uh empathize with one another you can't go that so you got to right right down the middle of the road right straight and that's why it's so hard to to to articulate these things correctly brother R said and I will restore he said now the first thing that Pentecost produced was Brotherly Love now you think about that what a statement the first thing that Pentecost produced was brotherly love it tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a Brotherhood to such such a way that they had everything in common in the Bible Days A brotherhood Paul spoke of this Brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of the Pentecostal church and then said in 1 Corinthians 13 that though I speak with tongues as men and angels and have not this love which brings the Brotherhood I am nothing and though I have the knowledge to understand understand all the mysteries of God I am still nothing without love the love of the Brethren now you you think about that if you if you go to tell somebody all the Mysteries that you understand and but yet it's lacking love in your heart and you don't really care about that brother you just care more about sharing the information that you have you see it that's what he's saying it it just without love everything just begins to fall apart you're you're trying to share somebody the gospel how can you really share the the gospel effectively if they don't see kindness and love and know that they that you care about their their soul and see that's where you really you getting up into Brotherly Love Brotherly Love is looking past all the little faults and problems that somebody has down in the inside of that person is is if they're born again is something well even if you're not born again you've got a soul that's worth 10,000 worlds and if you're born again that's God down on the inside so even you know you want to you want to put that in the right place too that your your brother is got God enthroned on their heart and so you want to respect them and so you're looking at that you begin to look at things differently because of the love of God being projected let's let's read what Paul what brother R was referring to in 1 Corinthians 13 He said though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity or love I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol so it if you speak with tongues and you got a gift and you're and the Lord's moving in your life supernaturally but you don't have love then what good is that it's like you're just going over to that symbol there and just blang on it bling bling bling bling bling because it's you there's no love love is what love is what love is what keeps everything together it's that's that's and he said though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth mean nothing now you see why see why love is so so difficult to articulate correctly cuz sometimes you know maybe your mind immediately goes when you start talking about love well love is corrective and it starts going down that path love is many things so that's what we want to meditate on this morning love is love is more than just grabbing Somebody by the collar and saying you're going to do it this way there's there's there's a lot of things that go into love love is being kind to one another love is respecting one another's boundaries love is respecting thinking about what how somebody's going to perceive the way that you present the gospel and trying to trying to win that person over love is all those things now brother R said in pmer worm glus korm caterpillar he said the next thing that we'd like to say for is brotherly love has been eaten away from the vine Brotherly Love Jesus said this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another oh you think about what a weighty statement that is that that's how people will know that you are Christian because of your love right well now let's just look at an example if a man don't believe the same as I do I'll go right into his congregation and preach with him just preach what he believes and go right ahead and let it go because I love him now what let's let's pause let's think about that if God if if there's a Believer that's really born again and if they're if they're wrong God if if they just continue on we've got a promise in the Bible that the spirit of truth will lead and guide us into all truth so there thereby we can have confidence that the same God that has led us to the truth if they're born again and they just keep keep pressing on that same God cuz God promised it will lead and guide them to the truth just the way that he led us to the truth so there you can look past all the little differences and things and just love them and try to help them along maybe give them some words of encouragement uh and and not be so quick to push the other person out and say Well they're not they're not part of it by their fruits you know that he said if they don't believe it and they haven't got Brotherly Love they drop out disagree fall away I have nothing to do with it if if they haven't got Brotherly Love see we want to look past all the little the little things that people say to us and just keep pressing on why don't you come to me and talk to me about it he said you don't know what I believe see what difference does it make anyhow what I believe it's who I believe Jesus Christ now that's that's kind of a statement to meditate on he's saying it matters more who I believe then what I believe cuz if you're looking at Jesus Christ and not the minister behind the pulpit not one another if you're looking at Jesus Christ and you're putting one foot in front of the other we're going to get there so you just love one another we're going to get there I've never left a meeting yet with a bad taste as I know of but you see brotherly love has been all discarded and Paul seen it 1 Corinthians 13 He said let Brotherly Love continue but brotherly love has been taken away now let's read some scriptures about brotherly love you know what's interesting is that Paul is the only one in the New Testament that used that phrase brotherly love there's a lot of others that Peter talked about it that different ones talked about it in Scripture that you can read about but that phrase brotherly love only came from Paul and what a strange thing you start doing research and and what a strange things to tack those two concepts together love and brother brother L love to put them together to represent something something that's Supernatural that God can do in your life where where uh I mean we'll get to it in a moment that that's why when we come to the house of God we call one another brother and sister it's more than just a symbol of respect but it represents that we are because the life of God has been imparted to us and we're all part of the children of God that we are spiritually supernaturally brothers and sisters and that you you really understand that right and and you you you you'll begin to project the love that Paul is talking about like in Romans 12 where he said let love be without dissimulation upour that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another you you'll find out when you study scripture that kindness is spoken of an awful lot be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another and in first Thessalonians he said but as touching Brotherly Love ye need not that I write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another in First Peter Peter says seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit un unan love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently and in chapter three Peter said finally be be ye all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous and John of course we know John talked about love a lot we know that we have passed from Death un life because we love the Brethren yes sir you that's how you know that's what John is saying that's how you know that you're a Christian when somebody can maybe say a little hurtful word but yet you love them anyway when somebody does something that disa appoints you but you love them anyway because you're trying to win them to the Lord and and and beyond that so many other attributes that go into just the reasons why you love one another in John Chapter 13 John said Jesus said a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you love that you also love one another now that's a pretty big thing a pretty big statement to love one another as Jesus loved us cuz Jesus gave his life for us he laid down everything for us and as we're going to do later this afternoon he got down on his knees and washed the feet of his disciple of Peter and so he he he abased himself and gave his life gave everything died died so that they could have life all those so we got to live in we got to follow in that example in verse 35 he said by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another now see this is what we're growing up to in maturity you start out with a little baby form not really knowing quite how to express love and not being able to react the right way in different circumstances but you grow and you grow and it that that Divine love that is in you from the New Birth pushes out and pushes out until you come into a mature form where you can stand there like Jesus as they were slapping him on the face and really love you can stand there on the on the cross like and even like Steven did when they were owning him and say father forgive them cuz they don't know what they do in Hebrews 13:1 where're we're continuing on he said let Brotherly Love continue now now I I've got this slide in here for a reason let's meditate on this for a moment I I I actually got to listening to a little Baptist on on YouTube doing a little Sunday school lesson and he made this statement that when he be started going through Bible School the first thing they told him this is in a a bible school he that as a Christian you will find that the people that will hurt you the most will be other Christians now this what this goes into brotherly love this is kind of the elephant in the room that when you're a Christian people are going to hurt you and the the Christians a lot of times are going to say and do things more hurtful than than people in the world that people that you work with because and really because your expectations are higher you come to church and you expect that people are going to love and be kind and everything I I got out the other day just actually I think it was yesterday or the day before I was on the phone with a pastor and he just began opening up to me about um things that had happened in his life that things hurtful things and and I'm relating this because there's a lot of people that have been hurt by a lot of things and been going through a lot of things and it's part of your Christian Journey that God molds you into a place where you react the right way that because as a Christian that's what we're that's what we're growing up into brotherly kindness as a Christian you must learn to love in spite of the way that people do you and say to you and you know it's just part of life that sometimes things are going to be said that you don't like even you know I I was I was meditating this morning I I have probably I'm almost certain of it said things that that have hurt and grieved people in the past and it hurts me to even think about that but you know I that's not my intention I certainly I certainly never want to want to say or do anything that would hurt somebody and maybe maybe now would be a good time to express my apology to you if I've ever done anything I'm sorry and I you come to me and I'll make it right but but when people here's the Christian principle those things are going to happen and when they do happen we've got to react in the right way because that's and you're it's not a rule book where we're trying to put in feathers but it's a something that God has to do where you eat and you eat and you eat and you push out until it's not something that you're putting on but it's something truly genuine that God has done in your life where you can love somebody even if they hate you now you think about what John Wesley said here in this quote he said though we cannot think a light may we not love a light that we don't think aik you know you go around this building this morning there's probably a lot of different thing different differences of opinion some believe we landed on the moon some believe we didn't some believe this some believe the all the different kind of things that you could go through but yet we can love one another may we not be of one heart though we are not of one opinion without all doubt we may here in here in all the children of God May unite not withstanding these smaller differences dietr boner said those who love their dream of a Christian Community more than they love the Christian Community itself become destroyers of that Christian Community even though their personal intentions may be ever so honest Earnest and sacrificial what's he saying that you come to church and you have this lofty expectation of how everything is going to be and you begin to lose sight of the fact that these are individuals that these are people and you stop loving one another because you've got this losty uh this you think it should be this way you don't like the way the song service is conducted maybe you don't like the personality of the minister and you begin to lose the love for the one another that's what he's saying in other words when individuals become so attached to their idealized vision of the community they can become critical and discontented or even disruptive when the real Community doesn't live up to that Vision instead of accepting and loving the community as it is with all its imperfections they may try to force it to fit their ideal causing Discord and potentially tearing the community apart and we certainly don't want to force anything forcing is that nickan Spirit where you're trying to drive people to the gospel and that is absolutely opposed to everything that we stand for so anyway the point of this is look past all the imperfections as love one another brother R said in Divine love and Sovereign Grace he said now we are faced in a day that when it's prophesied to us that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts that there is in God's Bible if the Lord Jesus to stand on the platform tonight and look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice you can be a great person a great Minister I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel or I'll give you the gift of teaching the word or I'll give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or any of the fine Gifts of Faith any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them everyone to you but then I'll withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift from you I'd say Lord take all the gifts amen and let me have the love see for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must have love now I was thinking you know how see how important love is it trumps every other gift that God could give you and I was thinking yesterday as as they lowered brother Hal down in the ground all the words that were said about him reflecting on the love and kindness that he had displayed to people in his life now you see that's really that's really maybe another elephant in the room that's how people will remember you is the love the love that you had for God yes and the love that you had for your family the love that you showed to people at church and the kindness that you demonstrated the way that you have reflected God so you think about what what really is brotherly love and I've got a picture here of of a brother carrying helping another brother carry a heavy burden when you can yoke yourself up to the other brother now you see sometimes our mind goes to well I don't see brotherly love but let's go back to yesterday you see brotherly love being on displayed when people are saying encouraging words to the family people are getting up early morning to to make them mashed potatoes laboring in the kitchen all these things go together because we're helping when somebody's in need the whole church comes together and you're helping somebody that's in a need in a time of trouble what is brotherly love love for one another that's why we refer to each others as Brothers and Sisters in Christ which signifies a spiritual kinship among Believers emphasizing that we are all part of the family of God Brotherly Love in This sense means showing love and care and concern for fellow Believers supporting each other in times of need and fostering Unity within the church I'm going to skip that quote just for a minute love for others love towards all people even those outside the faith and love is when you when you love the beggar on the street and try to help somebody maybe at work tell them about the gospel that's an expression of agape love which is selfish selfless sacrificial love that seeks the best for others like doing something nice opening up your door to somebody when there's maybe a v visiting Minister comes to the church and you you're hospit hospitable to them and you'll put them up or different ones in the church doing things respectful dialogue talking to one another with respect doing things doing things for one another service empathy and compassion and promotion of Peace trying to resolve conflicts in your home trying to keep the peace between different Brothers maybe that have differences of opinion defending the oppressed being generous being generous when it comes time for a mission trip and you're willing to help out being generous with cuz why God loves a cheerful Giver praying for one another getting on your knees and the long hours of the night and praying because it's it's love you're doing it out of love and living with Integrity what is brotherly love it's a reflection of divine love which is why John said beloved let us love one another for love is from God and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God if you can love uh is if if it's really matured and grown up to you till it's bubbling out like a Wellspring of everlasting water where everybody can see it then it's evident that you know God what is brotherly love we let's we're going to dive into it we just got a few more minutes it's looking out for the well-being and happiness of others as if they were family as if they were family now see our our our our our model for the family though is what God says about it in his word because you look at a lot of families and some families are very bitter and they have a lot of Discord and things that's not the model I want to look at some families families have different kind of Dynamics and different kind of issues and things and so we want to make sure that we're looking at the right model of what a family is in Philippians chap 2: 3- 4 he said let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others that means when somebody's going through something you you want to help them out you want to uh you you want to be there for them to encourage them and give them give them comforting words and 1 Thessalonians 5:11 he said wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do another thing brotherly love means if you really examine it out is mutual respect and regard for each other's feelings opinions and boundaries treating one another with kindness and consideration now I got a little kid now see this is where we really get into the needy greedy of it you think well I don't have boundaries and I shouldn't have boundaries but everybody's got boundaries when a little a young lady goes on a date or goes out uh sitting down in the living room with a young man or whatever she's got boundaries with the way that that man can talk to her and and refer to her and everybody's got boundary you'll say maybe the maybe the simplest boundary would be like this this little kid sitting there in the back seat of the car and the other kid goes sitting on his side of the seat where you got a boundary and so really when you when you start loving one another and respecting one another you're going to recognize that other people have boundaries and you're going to stop when they say you can't cross my boundary you're going to respect that we've got boundaries maybe another example of a boundary is when when you go through the buffet line and you got your plate of food and you got your mashed potato sitting there and your boundary is this is my food now I I I'm willing to give it to you if you need food but it's my food and you can't just stick your fork in my food in my plate and grab my food because I've got a boundary it's a boundary and if you respect me you'll respect my boundary now now sometime now th this honestly this gets deeper because I I've really been studying out how Satan will try to what what do in in the in the Old Testament the boundary was the promised land and what the devil would do the amorites and the moabites would they would cross that boundary they' get own the property of the Israelites and that's the same thing that the devil will do in your life and you got to realize brother random said that Satan is a bully and that's what a bully does like this picture he'll poke poke your fing his finger at you try to get on your property and you have to stand firm and say this is my property and you can't come on my property you real you realize you begin to you begin to treat treat the devil like a bully and say this is mine God has given it to me and recognize that God has given you boundaries that you can enforce against the devil so we got a we we we've got boundaries that's that's just the the the the reality of the thing we've got boundaries and when you really respect and you're really kind to one another you will respect one another's boundaries resp and boundaries is is is part of self-respect setting boundaries is a sign of self-respect it means you value yourself enough to Advocate your own well-being and I I I maybe you you say well this seems different than Luke 16 where it says that Jesus Jesus told us that if somebody asked for your cloak give them your tunic also but maybe we don't have time in the few couple of minutes remaining but there's I I I I just want to make the point there's nothing wrong with standing up for your boundary and saying this is mine and every you know you got a home you got a fridge when somebody comes over if you don't want somebody poking around in your refrigerator you can say I would brother I would rather you didn't open up my fre fridge if you want something I'll get it for you now now of course you know when you come to my home if you've ever been there you're welcome to open up the fridge or the pantry or whatever I I'm not going to set that boundary but some people might and if they do it's common courtesy to respect that boundary because they don't want you looking in their fridge and and so that's what kindness is kindness is respecting the boundary that somebody else has if they don't want to be talked to in a certain way and they say brother I you know I I don't want to be called that name I I that bothers me when you it hurts my feelings when you call me that then they've set a boundary and if you're kind and respectful and loving then you will respect that boundary now is't that example of this little This Little Child in the back uh one's poking at the other just like how we used to do when we were riding down in the car with Mama and Daddy one of them's trying to get over on the other seat and when we were kids we didn't respect boundaries but when we're adults We Know Better Don't boundaries are for protection like like the example of the of the young lady that's got you know you're she's talking to a young man there's going to be boundaries of respect a father is going to set boundaries and you better not cross those boundaries when you're talking to a father's daughter boundaries protect us from being manipulated used or violated boundaries are for your emotional health they prevent us from being overwhelmed by the needs or demands of others allowing us to prioritize our own well-being and emotional health like like some people at work you know they'll turn their phone off at night so they cuz they got a bound I got to get some sleep so they set that boundary don't call me after a certain time and you're setting those boundaries so that you can have sane a sane mind you know good emotional health and clear communication boundaries help us communicate our needs and desires more clearly and assertively reducing under misund understandings I've got one more minute and I'll just close on that thought I think most problems in relationship ships most problems in the church most problems anywhere come from miscommunication so if you can learn to articulate things well and communicate clearly if you if you don't like it when your when your spouse doesn't help out around the house or whatever communicate it and things will that that helps a whole lot if you don't like the way that somebody's talking to you communicate and it will help communicate and set those boundaries because if nobody knows that you're offended nobody knows that you're hurt then you end up having unreasonable expectations and it just causes all sorts of problems that we're talking about what are we talking about loving one another respecting respecting and being kind to one another amen we'll stop right there God bless you
