[33:34] Redemption through his blood the
[33:35] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[33:38] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[33:41] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[33:43] Prudence Prudence having made known unto
[33:47] us the mystery of his will according to
[33:49] his good pleasure which he had purposed
[33:51] in himself that in the dispensation of
[33:54] the fullness of times he might gather
[33:56] together in one all things in Christ
[33:59] both which are in heaven and which are
[34:01] on earth even in him in whom also we
[34:04] have obtained an inheritance being
[34:06] predestinated according to the purpose
[34:08] of him who worketh all things after the
[34:11] counsel of his own will that we should
[34:13] be to the praise of his glory who first
[34:16] trusted in Christ you may be seated the
[34:19] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[34:22] the
[34:23] word we have a good many quotes So
[34:32] now remember we're talking about
[34:37] predestination
[34:39] predestination the act
[34:41] of
[34:44] determining a Destiny or a thing to take
[34:48] place you
[34:50] know time date situation whatever and
[34:55] that's
[35:02] well there's now there's a couple of
[35:05] them that just come out that way just
[35:06] give them out cuz a couple of them are
[35:08] stapled together then the rest of them
[35:10] is not supposed to be
[35:12] okay I have trouble with that printer
[35:15] all right but now talking
[35:18] about
[35:21] predestination they said the act or
[35:23] state of predetermining
[35:25] something and how does God do
[35:29] that we found that he does it by for
[35:34] knowledge now as I say you know we
[35:36] people want to hear this great
[35:38] Revelation about uh how we was back dire
[35:42] and we was this all right we're going to
[35:44] begin to get into those things and begin
[35:47] to talk about it a little bit but the
[35:50] first point is to remember that if he
[35:53] predestines in any other form than the
[35:57] fact of forn knowledge
[36:00] first then you have him
[36:03] predetermining without giving a
[36:06] choice right all right see now consider
[36:10] that fact see if you go to
[36:13] predestination in any other way than the
[36:16] way of approaching it by forn
[36:19] knowledge you've turned out to make God
[36:22] choosing and not giving us a choice but
[36:26] if you go by for knowledge then you can
[36:29] see that he could look down
[36:31] through and then he could
[36:34] predestinate what would
[36:37] be because of his forn knowledge of the
[36:41] fact that it would be all right now if
[36:43] God forn knows anything to be there is
[36:46] never any form or way that you can
[36:49] change that amen see you can argue well
[36:53] the the man got 15 years but don't you
[36:55] know that God knew he's going to going
[36:56] to give him 15
[36:58] years see it's not something pulled over
[37:02] on God see all right see we we don't get
[37:05] into those forms we we stay is in the
[37:09] scriptures but
[37:12] now I hope you caught on to what I was
[37:14] to say in there on the service this
[37:17] Sunday and uh we were talking
[37:21] about I gave you a couple of quotes back
[37:24] where we would have
[37:25] them but brother brandom says on the the
[37:28] number one and number two of your notes
[37:29] is just kind of a repeat number three is
[37:32] to of a repeat of what we're talking
[37:34] about Sunday but brother Brandon says on
[37:37] Ephesians parallels Joshua
[37:39] 19651
[37:41] 15E he said listen to this
[37:45] predestination looks back to for
[37:47] knowledge that's right now watch you now
[37:50] that's down here he's got that quote
[37:51] identically but on this one what does he
[37:53] say I mean
[37:55] election election looks back to for
[37:58] knowledge that's right right right and
[38:01] predestination looks to Destiny now I
[38:04] don't know whether I've got it on the
[38:05] back of these notes but anyhow I look
[38:07] was looking at it a moment ago the
[38:09] prophet of God said predestination and
[38:12] election was the same thing amen all
[38:16] right so now what is he
[38:19] saying so we've got the other one Jesus
[38:22] arose he stated that 1956 405 that
[38:26] predestination looks back to forn
[38:29] knowledge and forn knowledge looks on to
[38:31] Destiny all right so that
[38:34] means
[38:37] that for knowledge comes before
[38:41] predestination right because it looks
[38:43] back to
[38:45] right all
[38:46] right so predestination as everybody
[38:50] thinks with this we're that with this
[38:51] and that you know form see it's got to
[38:54] look back to for knowledge amen all
[38:58] right and then if you're talking about
[39:00] elect well now brother Dale we are the
[39:04] elect well then he said election looks
[39:07] back y to for knowledge right sure amen
[39:11] all right so now you you argue with him
[39:14] about what you're talking about see I'm
[39:17] just wanting to believe it and if
[39:19] there's any common sense to language
[39:22] then see it would mean that for
[39:25] knowledge is is first yep right right
[39:28] then election or
[39:31] predestination follows thereafter yep or
[39:34] else you you've messed it up now you go
[39:36] any other way and you believe what you
[39:38] want to cuz I looking at the quote what
[39:40] today that brother said you're not going
[39:42] to change them anyway right amen and not
[39:46] you're not going to change people's mind
[39:48] right they're going to go right on
[39:50] saying well he was wrong there you know
[39:53] but he was right over here well that's
[39:55] all right go and do what you want to
[39:57] because what I'm trying my best to get
[39:58] you to see is if we approach it though
[40:02] in any other form than for knowledge
[40:06] first then you're changing what he said
[40:09] right even of election or predestination
[40:12] and he said it was the same thing right
[40:15] see we're elect according to for
[40:18] knowledge all right amen then the
[40:21] scriptures right the prophet's right you
[40:22] said but yeah we I want to get into all
[40:25] of this great
[40:27] great things that makes me feel so good
[40:30] to know this that of the other
[40:33] well it will all have to fit that's
[40:37] right are your feelings is because of
[40:39] something that you think is right Y and
[40:44] that won't do you any good see I ain't
[40:47] worried about feelings I'm worried about
[40:49] what the word
[40:51] says yeah but Brother D I just don't
[40:54] feel it
[40:55] well
[40:58] Cain said the same
[41:00] thing cuz he said I can't see the
[41:02] Revelation that Abel's got
[41:05] right right right so he turned around to
[41:08] God you remember we gave it turn the
[41:10] other day and he said you take it or
[41:13] leave it I've done all I'm going to do
[41:15] in other words that's right so I'm going
[41:17] to follow my thought my
[41:19] Doctrine see and that's what people are
[41:22] doing because they're not getting it
[41:24] into the right order see that election
[41:26] then in predestination now has to come
[41:30] after for
[41:32] knowledge y
[41:35] right you say well bring me the quotes
[41:37] in to show me where the Prophet taught
[41:39] it any other way cuz I've run it and run
[41:41] it and run it through as much as I can
[41:42] do with the computer you
[41:44] know and and and that's the words I find
[41:48] and the bases I find see that for
[41:50] knowledge has to be first right because
[41:53] if you take predestination first
[41:57] see that was that was the way that's
[41:59] what I said it it's seemingly right
[42:01] backwards to our
[42:03] thinking because you know if I wrote it
[42:06] down I'd have wrote it down that
[42:08] predestinated under for
[42:11] knowledge but see that won't fit the
[42:13] scripture nor the the prophet's message
[42:16] and that's what our mind is locked
[42:19] on so our mind has to be
[42:22] undone by
[42:24] Revelation are we still got the old
[42:27] doctrine that we had
[42:30] right so then you know pray for a
[42:34] revelation because that's the only way
[42:36] we'll ever get it
[42:37] see then what could he do
[42:41] then now we're going to talk about
[42:43] chosen in him because that's verse three
[42:48] amen
[42:50] now uh I'm not changing scriptures
[42:53] around I'm just saying verse three
[42:56] is covering where we are already in the
[42:59] Born Again experience of in Heavenly
[43:02] places in Christ Jesus that's why I
[43:04] jumped over verse three to go on to
[43:07] verse four cuz verse three is telling
[43:10] you that you're already already already
[43:12] but then verse four goes back to show
[43:15] you how you can attain unto that all
[43:18] right so we'll get back to verse three
[43:20] you know eventually but I want to go
[43:21] with verse four it says according as he
[43:23] has chosen us in him
[43:28] right now how was we chosen because we
[43:30] were so
[43:34] good we were chosen in
[43:38] him all right when were we chosen in him
[43:42] before the foundation of the world that
[43:45] we should be holding Without Blame
[43:46] before him in love all right so
[43:50] now according to the
[43:53] Bible revelations what is it 13:8
[43:57] that he stood as a lamb slain before the
[44:00] foundation of the world all right so now
[44:03] if he stood as a lamb slain before the
[44:05] foundation of the world then when he was
[44:08] accepted we was accepted in him amen
[44:12] that's right he said now wait just a
[44:14] minute brother Dale because you you
[44:15] you've been laying it down so far about
[44:18] for
[44:20] knowledge and and emphasizing heavily on
[44:23] the basis that God looked down and saw
[44:27] you MH make the choice
[44:30] right well that's
[44:32] true he did that's right then he could
[44:36] act according to your
[44:39] choice and he'd have salvation for you
[44:42] because he knew you'd want to be
[44:44] saved now that doesn't change when we're
[44:47] getting into this of being chosen in
[44:54] him all right now cuz you see
[44:58] that's the point I've tried to make I
[45:01] gave it back to you on uh the super sign
[45:04] there in 63 11:29 that he doesn't
[45:08] predestinate by his
[45:11] desires cuz he desired that everybody be
[45:14] saved amen but he predestines according
[45:17] to his for knowledge
[45:19] amen all right he knew who would accept
[45:23] him it and who would not therefore he
[45:26] could make everything work according to
[45:27] his big time clock that's ticking away
[45:30] for he could foretell the end from the
[45:32] beginning amen number three on your nose
[45:36] all
[45:37] right he knew what you were going to do
[45:42] right
[45:44] huh now we're going to get into it in a
[45:46] minute chosen in him we get to that part
[45:48] but let's get this other out of the way
[45:49] contining for the Fai number 4 55 to20
[45:53] perhaps back Yonder before either was
[45:57] born he knowed we was going to meet here
[46:03] tonight he is an infinite God he knows
[46:06] all things predestinated certain things
[46:09] to take place but even before the world
[46:13] ever
[46:15] formed he fornew all things that's right
[46:20] now remember the point I made on the
[46:22] first one and I forgot it on a couple
[46:23] more I said the basis of what we have of
[46:27] understanding anything in the Bible is
[46:29] based upon whether or not God forne
[46:32] right right that's right or whether or
[46:34] not he is infinite right amen whether or
[46:36] not he knows everything right see now if
[46:40] he doesn't then what do we got to worry
[46:41] about that's right maybe the part that I
[46:44] am he'd
[46:46] forget he say well he can forget brother
[46:48] they right if we put it under the blood
[46:50] right but don't you think he forew that
[46:52] because he had to make a
[46:54] way that's right had to make a way that
[46:56] it could be put under the
[47:00] blood all right so then that's where we
[47:02] ought to take it and and and deal upon
[47:05] that now so watch what he says on Modern
[47:08] events made clear by prophecy 1965
[47:12] 1206 he's come talking about according
[47:15] to the word if it comes from God because
[47:16] it's to vindicate or to prove God's
[47:19] presence and he forew all things all
[47:23] these things being by his for for
[47:25] knowledge he ordained for ordained it's
[47:29] called in the Bible predestinated every
[47:32] age to its place and every man to its
[47:36] place and every Messenger to its place
[47:38] he's God the devil ain't pulling nothing
[47:40] over on him
[47:42] right so now he's predestinated by his
[47:45] forn
[47:47] knowledge no he
[47:50] fornew all right now he forew then that
[47:55] Jesus Christ was going to
[47:57] die on the
[48:01] cross right he so much forew it y that
[48:06] as far as he was concerned and what he
[48:08] wrote in the Bible about it yep that it
[48:12] was before the foundation of the world
[48:15] right now that's how much his for
[48:17] knowledge was
[48:20] right all right but
[48:23] now had Jesus Christ not come and died
[48:27] it would have proven that it was not
[48:29] God's forn knowledge correct
[48:33] sensible but see he so fornew it that he
[48:38] could go ahead and write all the
[48:41] names in The Book of
[48:43] Life or write them in a section of it
[48:46] that he could even later I said a
[48:48] section of it a lot of people might not
[48:50] understand that but brother around
[48:51] divided it it's one book but many SE two
[48:54] sections amen Church age book we can
[48:56] cover that if you'd like it but
[49:01] see he
[49:03] forne so then when the lamb was
[49:09] slain all right you and I the prophet
[49:13] said were slain in him
[49:16] amen
[49:17] than that's right now so then if that be
[49:22] true then 2,000 years ago to fulfill
[49:26] what he saw before the
[49:29] world it would have to take place as I
[49:32] was saying or your your word would be
[49:35] wrong all right so we believe the word's
[49:39] right we believe that he was crucified
[49:42] in the mind of God before the world ever
[49:44] begun in his forn
[49:46] knowledge all right so then at the same
[49:49] time then as he was slain you and I were
[49:54] slain at the same time that's right in
[49:57] him thank you Lord all right so when he
[50:00] came into the
[50:04] world we had to be in him yeah now not
[50:08] his people right
[50:11] amen that's where we miss it at not his
[50:15] people I'm just going up so far and stop
[50:17] now I'm going to back
[50:19] up cuz we'd be on verse
[50:23] three but see
[50:26] we were in him when he walked the shores
[50:28] of Galilee that's right
[50:32] amen but how were we in
[50:35] him in that eternal life that he
[50:40] had that's right now I'll go ahead and
[50:42] say it because it'll come on back up
[50:43] later in that one
[50:49] soul that was dwelling in him which was
[50:52] the soul of almighty God
[50:54] right which was eternal life that's
[50:58] right now if we were part of that we're
[51:01] okay amen right if we're not part of it
[51:05] we're not okay right
[51:09] sensible so then we got to go back and
[51:12] see that we were chosen in him
[51:18] amen not that we was all standing up in
[51:23] heaven right
[51:26] all right but in the mind of God before
[51:29] the world ever begun in his for
[51:32] knowledge that's
[51:34] right he saw what would take place on
[51:37] the earth 2,000 years
[51:40] ago all right no way that could stop
[51:44] from happening
[51:47] amen but yet that being in God's
[51:50] mind now
[51:53] listen that being in God's mind for
[51:57] 4,000 years could not save one person
[52:01] right that's right that's
[52:03] right that's
[52:06] right
[52:08] okay everybody get
[52:11] it you couldn't give eternal life to one
[52:14] person right y
[52:17] right that's why they were waiting on
[52:19] him to come
[52:21] amen he had to pay the price for All sin
[52:24] right
[52:25] he died once the scripture says for
[52:28] all all right now so
[52:33] then there's no way so you can bypass
[52:37] right it taking place
[52:41] right see if you go to the
[52:44] predetermining of Eternity as most of
[52:46] the people try to then you're going to
[52:50] byass
[52:51] Calvary
[52:54] right then why did Jesus have to die if
[52:57] we came with eternal life yep that's
[53:00] right as the people want to believe
[53:03] that's right well brother D brother BR
[53:04] said it that's right but he's also the
[53:06] one that said
[53:07] he we died in him he's also the one that
[53:11] said you got to be born again to receive
[53:12] eternal life he's also the one that said
[53:15] I had to be born again talking about
[53:18] himself
[53:20] see but you
[53:22] see when I'm trying to get a point to
[53:25] you then we'll move
[53:27] on we've got to go back there and see
[53:31] that we were chosen in him
[53:36] right then he could
[53:41] predestinate all
[53:43] right not predetermined the world to be
[53:46] a certain
[53:48] way but he could see what the world
[53:52] would
[53:53] be and predetermine that way because it
[53:56] is it's it's settled right huh but he
[54:00] didn't predetermine it cuz he didn't
[54:03] make it that way right he knew that all
[54:06] he had to do was just put us on free
[54:09] moral agency and we'd fall that's right
[54:12] amen his for knowledge let him know that
[54:14] that's right well brother Dale if I
[54:17] would have just
[54:18] been I'm glad you come up with that idea
[54:21] in your mind do you think you f back
[54:23] there why do you fall now when you got
[54:25] the new birth right that's right you
[54:28] don't fall from eternal life
[54:30] no but we fall every day and stumble
[54:33] don't we am okay you get off the garbage
[54:38] can get on the word of
[54:40] God but now listen see then we've got to
[54:44] look back and
[54:46] see that we were chosen in him now I'm
[54:49] not going to cover
[54:50] this I know that he chose us but I'm not
[54:54] going to deal deal with that tonight now
[54:56] that'll be another message cuz if I get
[54:58] into that I can't bring out what I want
[55:00] you to see I'm wanting you to see one
[55:04] thing that when he died before the
[55:08] foundation of the world in the mind of
[55:11] God that was just as real right as it
[55:15] was the day it took place
[55:18] upon amen the Earth Yep as far as God is
[55:23] concerned right right but as far as we
[55:26] are
[55:30] concerned because if it's if it's a
[55:33] reality like we you know we want to get
[55:35] our minds so in a reality on some things
[55:37] and in the garbage can on the other but
[55:39] if it's so much in a reality that he
[55:42] died before the world then you don't
[55:43] need salvation that's
[55:48] right but the fact that he saw it before
[55:50] the world it meant it had to take place
[55:53] 2,000 years ago right amen
[55:58] right you can't change things
[56:02] right God forew what you and I would do
[56:05] and that's why the prophet said he would
[56:08] know how many would receive him and said
[56:12] he didn't do it halfhazard you know to
[56:15] say I'll just throw it down there I'll
[56:16] just go and maybe there somebody will
[56:18] accept it no he said he knew
[56:22] amen that's right see then if he knew
[56:28] right now then the choosing the part I
[56:33] want you to see is it is we were chosen
[56:36] in him
[56:39] amen before the foundation of the
[56:42] world all right but the choosing in him
[56:47] was on the basis of the fact that he
[56:49] knew you would choose him when he got
[56:50] here right all right everybody
[56:53] understand that amen right that he knew
[56:56] by his for knowledge that you would
[56:58] accept it down here right that's right
[57:00] so he would have it
[57:02] ready approaching any other way and
[57:05] you're you're going wrong right amen you
[57:07] can't line up scriptures and you can't
[57:08] do it but people don't care and ain't
[57:10] going to change nobody except what wants
[57:13] to hear right right I realize
[57:17] that but you see the book of Ephesians I
[57:22] gave it to you there number five on your
[57:24] notes I gave it back to you I mean
[57:25] number seven on your
[57:28] notes he said Paul is addressing this
[57:33] letter to those that are in Christ y the
[57:37] book of Ephesians number seven on your
[57:40] notes it's addressed
[57:43] to the whole Bible is addressed to those
[57:47] that are in
[57:48] Christ it's not written to The Sinner
[57:52] it's written to condemn The Sinner right
[57:57] all
[57:58] right but it's not written to him right
[58:02] see it's written to those that are in
[58:04] Christ Jesus because no man can call
[58:07] Jesus the Christ
[58:09] what except it be by the baptism of the
[58:12] Holy Ghost so he's not writing to the
[58:15] world this is a book written to the
[58:18] Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:21] amen even in the Old Testament it was
[58:25] only written to
[58:27] Israel right
[58:29] amen the chosen of God it written about
[58:33] I'm sure they're around cuz we're here
[58:36] right lady oia tells you what we're
[58:38] blind wretched miserable and naked and
[58:40] all like that yeah it tells a lot about
[58:43] the world but it's not written to the
[58:45] world right it's like brother R
[58:48] explained it if I was overseas somewhere
[58:50] you know going on a trip and I write my
[58:52] wife a letter see or she writes me a
[58:56] letter that's to me right now she may
[58:59] tell me what happened around the house
[59:03] she may tell me that one of the
[59:04] neighbors got hurt in a car wreck she
[59:07] may tell me that this that or the other
[59:09] happened but that has nothing to do with
[59:10] what me and her's doing right me and
[59:13] her's writing a letter to each other
[59:15] right to communicate so God sent the
[59:19] Bible to the Believers
[59:22] right right so then it's not telling the
[59:25] world that they're chosen in Christ
[59:27] right everybody's not chosen in Christ
[59:31] right
[59:34] right but it's telling those that were
[59:37] chosen in Christ what is going to happen
[59:39] to them while we here
[59:42] right that's right make your calling an
[59:45] election sure is that scripture amen see
[59:50] all right so we're chosen in
[59:53] him
[59:55] all right now it's hard to keep back off
[59:58] of the other part right right so look at
[1:00:00] number eight on your notes you got it
[1:00:02] spoken word Original Seed he said he's
[1:00:03] talking to the church now this is not to
[1:00:06] the outside y this is
[1:00:10] church all right the Bible is written to
[1:00:13] the church to those that are in Christ
[1:00:17] Jesus to do what to show you how you got
[1:00:22] into Christ Jesus right
[1:00:25] all right and showing us that before the
[1:00:28] foundation of the
[1:00:31] world he died to purchase salvation for
[1:00:36] you and I he didn't need it himself
[1:00:39] right amen so it was to purchase it for
[1:00:42] you and I all right at the same time he
[1:00:45] died to purchase it his for knowledge
[1:00:49] let him
[1:00:50] know who would want it right amen
[1:00:57] are you listening that follow me
[1:01:02] see then if he know who would want to be
[1:01:08] saved according to his for
[1:01:10] knowledge then he wouldn't as I showed
[1:01:12] you or we were talking about it there
[1:01:14] how can the thing form say why did you
[1:01:16] form it he didn't form us that way we
[1:01:19] formed
[1:01:21] ourselves that's right now then being
[1:01:24] that way we don't blame God we blame
[1:01:27] ourselves
[1:01:31] amen all right but watch now see we were
[1:01:35] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:01:38] the world right now we'll get back to a
[1:01:41] little bit in a minute but look on down
[1:01:42] to some of the quotes now you ought to
[1:01:44] know it but just I just gave you some
[1:01:46] quotes like here you himym 1956 number n
[1:01:49] on your notes 12:15 and that through the
[1:01:51] one offering he has perfected forever
[1:01:54] those that are that are Sanctified that
[1:01:56] are called for ordained chosen in him
[1:01:59] before the foundation of the
[1:02:03] world 284 Church age book you talking
[1:02:07] about
[1:02:09] elect and he says those who have that
[1:02:12] life were in him before the foundation
[1:02:14] of the world they were chosen in him
[1:02:17] before the foundation of the world and
[1:02:19] that Ro great Royal seed Jesus Christ
[1:02:22] was planted he died and that life that
[1:02:24] was in him came up through the wheat
[1:02:26] plant and his reproducing see showing
[1:02:28] that it took place down through the
[1:02:31] church ages what he
[1:02:34] saw you understand why I'm using that
[1:02:36] one he saw before the
[1:02:39] world but in this statement brother
[1:02:42] brandom is even caring it to showing
[1:02:43] that down through the church
[1:02:46] ages that seed would come forth all
[1:02:49] right he calls it a great hidden Mystery
[1:02:52] on Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:02:53] number 11
[1:02:55] he said what did he when did he choose
[1:02:58] us before the foundation of world when
[1:03:01] his great hidden Mystery this great
[1:03:03] secret he chose us in Christ before the
[1:03:06] foundation of the
[1:03:09] world
[1:03:13] now not according to the life
[1:03:20] Revival okay he's chosen Us in him
[1:03:24] before the foundation of the
[1:03:26] world I'm just looking down you read on
[1:03:28] down through on them while you're going
[1:03:30] Ephesians parallels Joshua 60
[1:03:34] 1960 5:15 when did God choose us when
[1:03:38] did God choose you that's got the Holy
[1:03:40] Ghost when did he choose you before the
[1:03:43] foundation of the world he chose you and
[1:03:45] sent Jesus that he might be the
[1:03:47] perpetuation of your sins to call you to
[1:03:51] reconciliation to himself to love you
[1:03:54] know right chosen Us in him 150 Church
[1:03:58] 's
[1:04:00] book and it says that he had chosen Us
[1:04:03] in him Jesus before the foundation of
[1:04:05] the world that means that we were right
[1:04:08] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[1:04:10] of God before the foundation of the
[1:04:12] world that gives an eternal quality to
[1:04:15] the elect am you can't get away from it
[1:04:17] that's right that's right all right now
[1:04:20] chosen in
[1:04:23] him
[1:04:26] so when he was
[1:04:30] accepted all that will ever have eternal
[1:04:33] life y you know part of the body of
[1:04:37] Christ we're talking about
[1:04:41] aren't they were accepted right there
[1:04:45] right amen why the prophet would say
[1:04:47] it's not whether you accept him or not
[1:04:50] y it's whether or not he accepted you
[1:04:54] amen cuz we'll get back to that more
[1:04:56] Sunday would it see all right but now
[1:04:58] follow what I'm talking
[1:05:05] about predestination
[1:05:09] then looks to the
[1:05:12] destiny that you and I would arrive
[1:05:15] to all right now in God's mind Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ died before the world as I said a
[1:05:22] moment ago right but then he was
[1:05:27] predestinated to die one day there on
[1:05:30] the cross right and there was no way to
[1:05:32] change
[1:05:34] that right because it was predestinated
[1:05:38] amen that's
[1:05:40] right
[1:05:41] now but then if we were chosen in
[1:05:47] him there's got to be a
[1:05:50] reason that we could be chosen in
[1:05:53] him
[1:05:59] now
[1:06:00] listen where you won't cross up some of
[1:06:03] the other thoughts see it's got to be in
[1:06:06] a line to be able to to be brought down
[1:06:10] to be able to be
[1:06:12] understood
[1:06:14] so it's not the person we got there in
[1:06:17] the quotes that comes predestinated
[1:06:21] eternally from
[1:06:23] God
[1:06:28] but the person see the person not
[1:06:31] predestinated eternity but the seed of
[1:06:32] the word
[1:06:34] amen so now the the forn knowledge of
[1:06:38] God would allow him to
[1:06:42] know each one of us and what we would
[1:06:47] do right right and he knew we would
[1:06:51] accept
[1:06:53] him
[1:06:58] right he knew that so he'd have it ready
[1:07:01] for
[1:07:04] us but that seed that he's talking
[1:07:12] about by his forign knowledge he knew
[1:07:15] see
[1:07:17] y James collie would come into the
[1:07:21] world and he knew one day he would
[1:07:24] accept him as his
[1:07:28] savior or else he'll never be saved
[1:07:32] that's right see now he proved it by
[1:07:35] what he
[1:07:36] done right now that's the forn knowledge
[1:07:39] of
[1:07:40] God right that would allow him to look
[1:07:43] down through and
[1:07:46] see okay so then James colie as a
[1:07:52] person became predestinated by for
[1:08:00] knowledge but James kie as a
[1:08:04] person didn't come predestinated
[1:08:07] eternally from God
[1:08:12] am do I need to state that a time or two
[1:08:18] again it's not the person n that's right
[1:08:21] that comes predestinated eternally right
[1:08:25] the person is predestinated by God's for
[1:08:27] knowledge just as well as he knows
[1:08:29] everybody else in the world
[1:08:32] Amen all
[1:08:34] right go I've got him in the back over
[1:08:37] there where brother Brown said people
[1:08:39] don't believe in predestination unto rep
[1:08:45] probation he said you you don't believe
[1:08:49] that now how would he predestinate under
[1:08:52] rep probation you know which means to
[1:08:55] reject or you know deny reprobate see
[1:08:59] those with a reprobate mind turn into
[1:09:02] the grace of God into lasciviousness Etc
[1:09:06] see all
[1:09:08] right so James collie the person we
[1:09:14] see was born 60 something years
[1:09:20] ago and God gave him
[1:09:24] to make him a
[1:09:26] person his mother and daddy sure was the
[1:09:29] part that was used to bring the body but
[1:09:32] that wasn't what caused the body to come
[1:09:34] God is the only one that can give life
[1:09:37] amen all right
[1:09:39] amen but you see then the Soul and the
[1:09:43] Spirit came from God Amen to make him a
[1:09:47] person y but that Soul or that Spirit
[1:09:51] was not Eternal right
[1:09:54] now we'll get back to it cuz I don't
[1:09:56] want to go no further that
[1:09:59] way but you
[1:10:01] see at the same time before the
[1:10:04] world God looked down and saw James
[1:10:08] collie and saw that he would
[1:10:12] accept him as his savior he saw the age
[1:10:16] he would live
[1:10:17] in and if I don't get back to them
[1:10:19] they're in the message there you quotes
[1:10:22] that the seed was predestined ated for
[1:10:24] the
[1:10:25] age as well as the individual that's
[1:10:27] right you and I wasn't predestinated to
[1:10:30] be back down in any other
[1:10:34] age and brother brandom even covered how
[1:10:37] the election of the body would cover he
[1:10:39] said go back through your lineage and
[1:10:41] you find out God had to breed this
[1:10:43] person to that person to this person to
[1:10:45] that
[1:10:47] person that's what he said that's right
[1:10:50] to bring
[1:10:52] you that's right
[1:10:54] amen all right see it wouldn't matter to
[1:10:57] me if I was his blackish s or yellow as
[1:11:02] could be what would it make any
[1:11:04] difference
[1:11:07] right right right I want to be a
[1:11:10] Christian doesn't matter what I am or
[1:11:12] what it bred down to get me
[1:11:15] here I'm just glad I got here right amen
[1:11:18] but the main thing is I'm glad that I
[1:11:21] could accept him as my savior
[1:11:24] right then I could find
[1:11:28] out that I really didn't seek him see I
[1:11:31] can't stay off that that I didn't seek
[1:11:33] him he chose me that's right all
[1:11:37] right but why did he choose me
[1:11:40] now why did he choose James call
[1:11:43] it that's
[1:11:48] right now there where your seed comes in
[1:11:52] at
[1:11:56] and it's easy to see that Jesus was a
[1:11:58] predestinated seat right amen not no
[1:12:01] problems right right nobody I mean
[1:12:03] anybody got any problems with seeing
[1:12:04] that Jesus was a predestinated Eternal
[1:12:06] seed that's right no no problem should
[1:12:09] be all
[1:12:11] right is it any problems where he would
[1:12:14] tell like uh the prophets that I knew
[1:12:17] you and for orain you amen before the
[1:12:22] world
[1:12:24] cuz he knew what they would
[1:12:26] do brother said he knew what Abraham
[1:12:29] would
[1:12:31] do see he knew what Jacob would do right
[1:12:35] he knew what Esau would do right all
[1:12:39] right so he could determine on that
[1:12:41] basis Y what he would
[1:12:45] do
[1:12:46] no see then it's not the person that
[1:12:49] comes predestinated
[1:12:51] eternally right huh right it's the cedar
[1:12:54] word right all right but remember now
[1:12:59] the cedar
[1:13:02] word now you're going to have to think
[1:13:04] with me for a little bit cuz I don't
[1:13:05] know no other way of saying
[1:13:07] it that seed can lay there for a long
[1:13:11] time before it is given eternal life
[1:13:16] right everybody
[1:13:18] agree right you can lay there a long
[1:13:20] time dormant the prophet called it that
[1:13:24] said mhm be the seed the
[1:13:28] word MH
[1:13:30] right but laying their
[1:13:33] dormant until God pours the water on it
[1:13:37] or the Holy Spirit to Quicken it right
[1:13:40] why is it that we don't know
[1:13:42] everything right right right right but
[1:13:46] yet you read it right yet you memorized
[1:13:49] it right right but yet it's got to be
[1:13:52] quickened amen to be made alive that's
[1:13:54] right all right that's right
[1:13:56] now so then how were we chosen in
[1:14:03] him he said well it's because he knew
[1:14:06] we'd choose him all
[1:14:09] right that has to do with James
[1:14:12] collie
[1:14:15] right yep did he you James call choose
[1:14:22] him
[1:14:24] but I'm talking about something deeper
[1:14:25] than that that everybody wants to talk
[1:14:27] about but they don't want to bring it
[1:14:29] down by for knowledge and get in the
[1:14:31] correct order
[1:14:36] right how are we chosen in
[1:14:40] him now number one
[1:14:44] is to be chosen in him you got to be in
[1:14:48] him right amen is that sensible that's
[1:14:51] right amen if it's in somebody else I
[1:14:53] wouldn't be chosen in him all right so
[1:14:57] then how was I in
[1:15:02] him not James colie right
[1:15:07] right
[1:15:08] no you had to be looking at something
[1:15:11] else
[1:15:17] amen God's word is his seed right amen
[1:15:24] or in other words the seat of God is the
[1:15:25] word of God
[1:15:28] right now
[1:15:30] then if the seed of God is the word of
[1:15:33] God and we would agree that Jesus was
[1:15:36] predestinated
[1:15:39] eternally but he had to come to Earth
[1:15:42] and live it out that's
[1:15:45] right we would agree the prophets would
[1:15:48] be
[1:15:49] predestinated right GI and callings are
[1:15:52] predestinated
[1:15:54] right
[1:15:57] right
[1:15:59] now but you see that's doing with what
[1:16:02] he says what he's doing right but if we
[1:16:06] can see Jesus was predestinated
[1:16:07] eternally why can't we see that we was
[1:16:09] in him that was the way we was
[1:16:11] predestinated that's right that's the
[1:16:13] only dealing of Eternity you can deal
[1:16:20] with see that way then end the eternal
[1:16:22] life you have
[1:16:26] tonight are you with me now the eternal
[1:16:29] life you have tonight the new birth you
[1:16:35] received that always was eternal
[1:16:41] right that's right now I've asked a
[1:16:44] question for many many years for
[1:16:46] somebody to explain it over all of these
[1:16:48] seed doctrines that they've got it's the
[1:16:51] new birth the birth of the seed you're
[1:16:53] born
[1:16:55] with everybody wants to make it or is it
[1:16:57] the birth of the word that you hear
[1:16:59] after you get here amen that's now which
[1:17:02] one is it that's all I want to know amen
[1:17:05] cuz if you tell me it was what I was
[1:17:08] before the world and I don't need
[1:17:10] eternal life that's right I don't need
[1:17:12] the new birth I don't need anything cut
[1:17:14] my head off I go to heaven
[1:17:17] y that's what I told a man one time I
[1:17:21] said you know
[1:17:24] if he always was eternal and just whack
[1:17:26] the babies kill everybody which is
[1:17:28] everybody going to
[1:17:30] heaven but everybody wasn't chosen in
[1:17:36] him now you following me I have to keep
[1:17:39] repeating
[1:17:41] it see if you keep saying that we were
[1:17:43] chosen in
[1:17:45] him and that totally has to do with what
[1:17:48] we do down here that's for knowledge
[1:17:52] right
[1:17:56] but that doesn't put us to where we
[1:17:57] could be chosen in
[1:18:06] him I'd invite you to listen this type
[1:18:09] over and over CU might sound
[1:18:16] confusing chosen in
[1:18:19] him before the foundation of right
[1:18:22] that's right
[1:18:23] amen then what part of you then could
[1:18:26] that be dealing with that's
[1:18:32] right come on now I keep making
[1:18:34] illustration to where you'll
[1:18:36] understand what part of
[1:18:39] you could be chosen in him before the
[1:18:46] world and not do away with the for
[1:18:51] knowledge that would know know where
[1:18:53] that seed would
[1:18:57] land then you could see God did have a
[1:18:59] plan and a purpose
[1:19:02] sure God did have
[1:19:08] children God was a Healer God was a
[1:19:14] savior he just didn't display it till he
[1:19:17] come hear it
[1:19:20] right you see AR you glad that you can
[1:19:24] believe the word
[1:19:29] right when other people can't believe
[1:19:32] it we're not going off on nobody that
[1:19:35] can't believe it that's because that's
[1:19:37] you know don't Crow all that's right you
[1:19:40] might have to eat some of it that's
[1:19:43] right so just leave everything alone and
[1:19:46] just believe what God says
[1:19:49] right so how then were we chosen in him
[1:19:57] because when he died we died
[1:20:02] right when he was accepted we were
[1:20:05] accepted
[1:20:06] right
[1:20:08] amen but he had to wait two 4,000 years
[1:20:13] just a time not in counting what how
[1:20:15] long it was back before the foundation
[1:20:17] world
[1:20:18] right to be able to make manifest upon
[1:20:21] the Earth that he was that predestinated
[1:20:24] seed right
[1:20:27] right that he did have eternal life
[1:20:31] contrary to a lot of them in the message
[1:20:33] say now that he didn't have eternal life
[1:20:34] well you got a problem man that's right
[1:20:38] you got a natural man dying for your
[1:20:40] sins and you're still in them but you
[1:20:42] see instead of sitting down and
[1:20:44] listening that's right to somebody that
[1:20:47] can at least get into it a little bit
[1:20:50] and study it out they're not going to
[1:20:53] listen to you especially
[1:20:55] preachers that's right they're going to
[1:20:57] preach whatever comes to their mind
[1:20:58] they're not going to listen what you say
[1:21:00] right and I know that I've known that
[1:21:01] ever since I
[1:21:04] started but that ain't going to stop me
[1:21:06] from preaching
[1:21:08] amen ain't going to stop me from
[1:21:10] listening to let God speak to me about
[1:21:12] something that's right cuz you see we
[1:21:15] were chosen in
[1:21:17] him as I said not the fact see that's
[1:21:22] what your mind wants to lock to the fact
[1:21:25] see of what I brought out about for
[1:21:27] knowledge so far that we were just
[1:21:30] predestinated in him because he seemed
[1:21:34] we want it right it's got to go further
[1:21:38] than that
[1:21:41] right now now listen there's a lot of
[1:21:45] people want he turn life y
[1:21:49] right but how come they don't get it
[1:21:52] right now you tell me Judas wanted to
[1:21:54] die and go to hell and I got some stock
[1:21:57] on a Brooklyn Bridge I'll tell
[1:22:02] you now he wanted to go to heaven right
[1:22:05] MH there never been a person that wanted
[1:22:07] to go to
[1:22:10] hell there's people that really you look
[1:22:13] at them and their lives are better than
[1:22:15] ours you look them at it their their
[1:22:18] doings and everything look across the
[1:22:20] land
[1:22:21] today and you see the people out there
[1:22:24] that are are
[1:22:27] spending every hour of the day trying in
[1:22:29] some
[1:22:30] way four people shot over there the
[1:22:33] other day and they were carrying Bibles
[1:22:36] around the world been doing that for
[1:22:38] years and years right I'm not saying
[1:22:41] they're not bride but I'm saying if they
[1:22:44] wouldn't Born Again believer they're not
[1:22:46] bride you can spend all of your life
[1:22:49] show me where came was wrong except for
[1:22:52] one one
[1:22:53] thing right he wouldn't accept the
[1:22:55] Revelation that it was the blood
[1:22:58] right if he to offered the blood and
[1:23:01] then took his offering up there behind
[1:23:04] that would have been Works following his
[1:23:05] faith that would have been all
[1:23:08] right y would you see everybody wasn't
[1:23:12] chosen in him am that's right you said
[1:23:16] but but but brother
[1:23:18] Dale you're s making it contradictory
[1:23:21] because you're saying that people want
[1:23:23] to be saved and God won't save
[1:23:26] them no they're wanting to go to heaven
[1:23:29] right they're not wanting to be
[1:23:31] saved they're not wanting to go to hell
[1:23:34] that's it exactly they're not wanting to
[1:23:37] be
[1:23:38] lost so
[1:23:41] thereby they won't accept him in his
[1:23:43] fullness right sure they accept him for
[1:23:47] salvation or healing or something but
[1:23:49] they won't accept him to be the Lord of
[1:23:50] their life right am
[1:23:56] see then they wouldn't chosen in
[1:23:59] him now if you're listening to what I'm
[1:24:01] talking about only the seed was what was
[1:24:03] chosen in him that's it
[1:24:05] amen y the seed was what was chosen in
[1:24:09] him the word
[1:24:11] right and there's a word for every age
[1:24:16] predestinated to that age
[1:24:21] amen and the people of that age made
[1:24:24] that word alive
[1:24:26] right and it become a Eternal
[1:24:29] predestinated seed right dwelling in a
[1:24:32] human
[1:24:34] being because it was the word what is
[1:24:37] the new
[1:24:40] birth well I see how did I C know it's
[1:24:43] the birth of the word
[1:24:47] amen and that's why people won't accept
[1:24:49] the word That's The Parables the Lord
[1:24:51] Jesus gave
[1:24:54] y they took it and kept it for a little
[1:24:57] while but then the cares and the the the
[1:24:59] things of life and all like that come in
[1:25:01] and they turned it
[1:25:04] down as I said about Judas he was there
[1:25:07] for three and a half years right putting
[1:25:10] every whole life on the line
[1:25:15] right but yet in the finality he proved
[1:25:19] what he was
[1:25:20] right he proved he wasn't chosen of God
[1:25:23] now listen Judas was
[1:25:26] chosen to be in the ministry of the day
[1:25:29] chosen to have the gifts of God chosen
[1:25:32] for all of those things y but yet he
[1:25:35] wasn't chosen for eternal life
[1:25:40] right so he had the
[1:25:44] seed without it being able to give
[1:25:47] life the prophet said that Jacob was
[1:25:51] seed
[1:25:53] but said Esau was not seed right all
[1:25:56] right he talks of none seed there's
[1:25:59] nothing in nonseed to Quicken what is a
[1:26:02] nonseed now in the hybrid condition if
[1:26:05] you go back and plant it it's going to
[1:26:07] go out of existence so that's the way of
[1:26:10] doing it so the easiest way to go is
[1:26:12] like with a
[1:26:13] mule the the mule can't reproduce itself
[1:26:17] right right because it's none seed
[1:26:26] sensible
[1:26:28] right but chosen in
[1:26:31] him well it was something I done good
[1:26:33] something something that's
[1:26:36] Catholicism pay you way there pave the
[1:26:39] parking lot well that's what we used to
[1:26:41] do in the Baptist you know we had one
[1:26:43] fell that he painted the church every
[1:26:44] time his KNE painted inside and that
[1:26:46] wouldn't charge to
[1:26:49] die and I guess they wrote over his
[1:26:51] Tombstone that he painted the churt do
[1:26:54] you know what he was he was a
[1:26:56] homosexual no joke everybody there know
[1:26:59] what he
[1:27:01] was put names on the pews why do they
[1:27:04] put it on that
[1:27:09] far you put it on there cuz you want
[1:27:11] everybody to know how much money you
[1:27:12] give oh my right I bought a Pew I'm
[1:27:17] going to heaven cuz that Pew is going
[1:27:18] and I'm going too now that's about as
[1:27:20] much as we got it based on I
[1:27:23] if the Pew makes it we make
[1:27:25] it just don't let nobody sit down in
[1:27:28] your Pew they might get there you not
[1:27:31] all right joke a little to get you out
[1:27:33] of the
[1:27:34] sternness but
[1:27:36] listen how were we chosen in
[1:27:42] him without making it they even have to
[1:27:46] choose
[1:27:51] everybody
[1:27:53] come on if it's not according to his
[1:27:54] desires he'd got to choose everybody
[1:27:56] that's
[1:27:58] right sure we put it on the basis and
[1:28:00] that's wonderful hold on to that until
[1:28:02] it comes to you all right hold on to it
[1:28:04] that he looked down and through it and
[1:28:06] see I would choose him that's
[1:28:09] good but what caused you to choose
[1:28:19] him when the prophet said we didn't
[1:28:21] choose him
[1:28:22] right said he chose us that's right and
[1:28:26] the Bible said we didn't choose Him
[1:28:28] scripture says no man assult God at any
[1:28:31] time but yet don't you remember in your
[1:28:33] life when you were coming up through and
[1:28:35] you were crying and praying and fasting
[1:28:37] and everything else to seek God to try
[1:28:38] to get the new
[1:28:40] birth but EV that evidently is not what
[1:28:43] he's looking at
[1:28:46] right but see if we were chosen in him
[1:28:49] that means we got to be a part of him
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:52] right amen and who was he John 1 tells
[1:28:57] you who he was that's that's right in
[1:29:00] the beginning was a word the word was
[1:29:01] with God and the Word was
[1:29:06] God did we make that with as a two
[1:29:08] that's it's good to have that word with
[1:29:10] because it means you and I can be
[1:29:15] there CU if it just said in the
[1:29:17] beginning was the
[1:29:19] word the Word was God
[1:29:23] you wouldn't have that word with in
[1:29:27] there even but it's put in there showing
[1:29:29] that we're part of him right cuz it's
[1:29:32] only the seed that comes predestinated
[1:29:34] eternally right so sure God looked down
[1:29:37] through
[1:29:38] time and saw who would accept he's not
[1:29:41] going to give that seed to someone that
[1:29:44] will that he does that he knows won't
[1:29:46] accept it now he'll offer it to him just
[1:29:49] as he offered that Pope the baptism of
[1:29:52] the Holy Ghost right
[1:29:54] right because that way the thing form
[1:29:57] can't say why don't you do
[1:30:00] this he offered salvation to everybody
[1:30:03] in the world but he knows everybody's
[1:30:05] not going to receive it so couldn't he
[1:30:07] go ahead and write down names sure you
[1:30:09] agree amen you agree by his for
[1:30:12] knowledge he could write the The Book of
[1:30:13] Life and and write down the names of
[1:30:15] those that would be safe you agree now
[1:30:18] if you agree with that then you got to
[1:30:19] agree with this
[1:30:23] okay so swallow it now let's see if you
[1:30:27] agree if he could do
[1:30:30] that why didn't he at the same
[1:30:33] time know exactly where that seed was
[1:30:35] going to fall
[1:30:38] right and how you would accept
[1:30:42] it and that seed would be
[1:30:47] him like I said now seed's no good
[1:30:50] without water see that's where we want
[1:30:52] to go with all of that you know brother
[1:30:53] R made the quote that you know you have
[1:30:58] eternal life amen he made the quote but
[1:31:00] you read what he
[1:31:01] says if you were in him in the
[1:31:07] beginning then you always was eternal
[1:31:10] right what was always Eternal we know
[1:31:12] it's not James
[1:31:13] college right Body Spirit and our soul
[1:31:17] cuz each one had a
[1:31:20] beginning right
[1:31:23] right but if we can receive his eternal
[1:31:27] life then that eternal
[1:31:33] life is in you and
[1:31:35] I now it cannot be in you and I if we
[1:31:40] don't first hear the
[1:31:46] word are you listening right it's why it
[1:31:49] says why how can they hear without a
[1:31:51] preacher right now can he preach unless
[1:31:53] he be
[1:31:54] sent see you never see nobody in the
[1:31:57] Bible receive eternal life unless they
[1:32:00] had heard a sermon now show it to me
[1:32:03] right they had heard a sermon by
[1:32:06] somebody Peter the house of conelius
[1:32:09] yeah Peter on the day of
[1:32:14] Pentecost how can you get eternal life
[1:32:16] without first hearing the word right
[1:32:18] that's
[1:32:20] right but you see people are say but we
[1:32:23] always was eternal the eternal life you
[1:32:26] have always was eternal cuz then the
[1:32:28] same people will say God's the only one
[1:32:31] that has eternal
[1:32:33] life cuz he's the only one eternal life
[1:32:35] and that's
[1:32:38] Zoe So when you came into the
[1:32:43] world you didn't have Zoe life did you
[1:32:47] you had life permitted amen for you to
[1:32:49] live
[1:32:50] in
[1:32:53] but God knew the age you and I'd be
[1:32:56] living you
[1:32:57] agree he knew you would accept this
[1:33:01] message uh this message is a seed right
[1:33:06] so was Luther's
[1:33:08] message so was Wesley's
[1:33:11] message it was a seed
[1:33:15] right and the seed back there gave
[1:33:19] life but Luther's message today won't
[1:33:22] give you eternal life no that's right
[1:33:25] more is
[1:33:26] required
[1:33:30] right so how were we chosen we were
[1:33:32] chosen in
[1:33:34] him so get us out of the way peoples
[1:33:38] Body Spirit and souls we're get it all
[1:33:40] out of the
[1:33:42] way and get it down to the bases of
[1:33:44] looking right straight at him and
[1:33:47] seeing that when he paid the
[1:33:50] price
[1:33:52] he also saw it we would accept it
[1:33:57] right but back before then he already
[1:34:01] cuz now listen here's one thing brother
[1:34:04] Dale is going to tell you he does
[1:34:05] believe I believe in a
[1:34:09] predestinated Eternal y seed or word of
[1:34:13] God right
[1:34:17] amen I believe that that's
[1:34:20] right I
[1:34:22] believe that
[1:34:25] God before he stepped into the form of
[1:34:29] what we call for
[1:34:31] knowledge to bring knowledge of Earth
[1:34:34] and
[1:34:36] existence that he always was
[1:34:40] eternal and that he was already a
[1:34:45] savior that he was already a Healer
[1:34:48] right he didn't have know where to
[1:34:50] display it no but that was in amen he
[1:34:53] never gained any attribute when he come
[1:34:55] here
[1:34:58] amen I believe you that have eternal
[1:35:01] life that that eternal life is the
[1:35:04] children of God as Paul said we are his
[1:35:08] offspring right
[1:35:10] amen everybody in the world is a child
[1:35:13] of God by creation right everybody don't
[1:35:17] matter what the child is where it's born
[1:35:19] who it's born to it is a child of God by
[1:35:22] creation am cuz God is the only one that
[1:35:25] can create right all
[1:35:29] now so then he did have
[1:35:35] children right he dwelt alone
[1:35:39] what with his
[1:35:43] attributes right
[1:35:45] right that's right we were in
[1:35:50] him
[1:35:52] brother aroundand him expressing it said
[1:35:54] just like you were in your father right
[1:35:58] he said just
[1:36:01] like you go out and plant your little
[1:36:03] one
[1:36:05] seed and it grows up into an apple
[1:36:10] tree and that tree grows up get big old
[1:36:13] tree over plenty you know many years and
[1:36:15] starts performing and bringing forth
[1:36:17] apples right and you get bushel of
[1:36:21] bushel of apples off of it you know for
[1:36:25] years and years and every one of those
[1:36:28] apples was in that one little seed right
[1:36:33] amen now how you going to explain
[1:36:36] that amen you got to admit it's true
[1:36:39] that's
[1:36:42] right ever seed in other words when God
[1:36:45] planted an apple tree in the
[1:36:47] garden now we know the flood and all of
[1:36:50] that but come on over women just get
[1:36:51] what we're talking
[1:36:54] about every Apple that would ever be on
[1:36:57] any
[1:36:58] tree would have had it been on the trees
[1:37:01] that he originally
[1:37:05] planted that's infinite
[1:37:09] God if not where'd it come from could
[1:37:12] come from nowh else that's right you get
[1:37:13] them from another planet no you know
[1:37:16] some extraterrestrial being brought down
[1:37:18] some trees and stuck them out no exactly
[1:37:22] amen we don't believe in that amen amen
[1:37:26] all
[1:37:27] right but you were in your great great
[1:37:31] grandfather now you know what he's
[1:37:33] saying
[1:37:35] right so that means that you were
[1:37:40] in now I don't mind saying this cuz
[1:37:42] don't matter to me that means that you
[1:37:45] were in Adam or you was in the
[1:37:50] Beast
[1:37:52] in the beginning right that's infinite
[1:37:55] God now if you don't agree with that
[1:37:57] where did it come
[1:37:59] from
[1:38:01] right plain right where'd it come from
[1:38:04] that's all I wants answers I stir you up
[1:38:06] give me an
[1:38:09] answer but it doesn't matter to me
[1:38:11] whether I was born direct descendants
[1:38:13] from the Beast that don't make no bit of
[1:38:14] difference to me cuz a born again
[1:38:16] experience take care of everything amen
[1:38:18] that's
[1:38:19] right cuz once Eve had that child or her
[1:38:21] wound was polluted they could nothing
[1:38:23] come out there but
[1:38:24] pollution
[1:38:27] right right just telling it like it
[1:38:32] is but you
[1:38:35] see we were chosen in
[1:38:39] him now he didn't choose because of our
[1:38:42] goodness we'll get to that Sunday that's
[1:38:45] right
[1:38:48] nope bless have nothing to do with it no
[1:38:51] M
[1:38:52] amen he chose
[1:38:54] us but why would he choose
[1:39:00] you well brother Dale he seen that I
[1:39:03] wanted he seen I was going to be so yeah
[1:39:05] go ahead
[1:39:13] Pharisee es saw where the seed would
[1:39:15] land right as far as I'm going I'll get
[1:39:18] back with it
[1:39:20] Sunday he saw where the seed would
[1:39:23] land the seed comes predestinated
[1:39:27] eternally the seed was what was chosen
[1:39:30] in
[1:39:33] him right so he didn't die for everybody
[1:39:37] we preach it for everybody we believe it
[1:39:39] for everybody but he didn't die for
[1:39:42] everybody he died for only for those
[1:39:43] that would choose him but it was because
[1:39:46] he had already chosen you said well then
[1:39:48] that didn't give the other people a
[1:39:49] chance no that's where you goofed up now
[1:39:51] we done spent four sermons right we done
[1:39:54] put four sermons in on the four
[1:39:55] knowledge that he doesn't choose by
[1:39:57] desires his election is not there one in
[1:40:00] tonight's message somewhere in here that
[1:40:01] his election doesn't come because
[1:40:04] of his
[1:40:07] choosing it's all on for knowledge
[1:40:11] amen but there is a
[1:40:14] seed right and just like it was with
[1:40:17] coming down through as The Great
[1:40:19] Masterpiece your Prophet preached
[1:40:22] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and all
[1:40:24] of this and coming down and then the
[1:40:25] building of the body then you start the
[1:40:27] New Testament and then you got to
[1:40:28] Matthew Mark Luke and John then you got
[1:40:30] coming over and you got it coming down
[1:40:32] building a body and when you come down
[1:40:34] through the seven Church ages and he
[1:40:36] said Mary
[1:40:39] represented you know ausa Street
[1:40:43] represented Mary that the word was in
[1:40:46] her y the word was in Mary right yep
[1:40:50] right but she was not the seed the seed
[1:40:52] was in
[1:40:53] her so is it down to the ages that each
[1:40:56] one was a partial for their time but in
[1:40:59] the end time it's got to come back to
[1:41:01] the original seed that's
[1:41:03] right we are
[1:41:06] not ausa Street Pentecostal
[1:41:10] amen that's
[1:41:12] right we are the seed right am
[1:41:15] reproduced again that's
[1:41:18] right so we were chosen in him
[1:41:24] y now put it in plain language and then
[1:41:26] I quit other words God had Offspring
[1:41:35] children he knew that all he had to do
[1:41:37] was turn us loose in life cuz he could
[1:41:39] never display his attributes as healer
[1:41:42] savior Etc cuz that would not have
[1:41:44] happen had he kept it in the way before
[1:41:47] he allowed it to be where we would have
[1:41:49] a fallen condition right
[1:41:51] right but then he knew where that seed
[1:41:55] would
[1:41:56] land that's right many are
[1:42:00] called right few are
[1:42:04] chosen but in the few that's chosen you
[1:42:06] know yourself that you can be chosen and
[1:42:08] still miss it right says whether or not
[1:42:13] we want the word right is the evidence
[1:42:17] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that
[1:42:19] right that's right
[1:42:22] what is the evidence whether or not the
[1:42:24] spirit in you agrees with the word
[1:42:28] right why because how can you deny it if
[1:42:31] you're word too right
[1:42:33] amen so when you received a new birth
[1:42:36] what was it you had to First hear the
[1:42:40] word and then when the word was
[1:42:42] quickened it was made alive it was
[1:42:44] exactly the word before the foundation
[1:42:45] of the
[1:42:48] world dwelling in a human body he
[1:42:51] talking about the uh the little woman
[1:42:53] that was married I believe that's right
[1:42:55] uh four times and the fifth one wasn't
[1:42:57] hers Etc he said look where that
[1:43:01] seed
[1:43:03] landed yep now we're quick to talk
[1:43:07] about that Mary could receive the
[1:43:11] seed you
[1:43:15] know but what about that a little
[1:43:17] prostitute
[1:43:19] right but God knew all he had to do was
[1:43:21] cross her path
[1:43:25] right and she had then what did your
[1:43:27] Prophet call it we'll get back to it
[1:43:29] what did he say she had he said she had
[1:43:34] representation one time off
[1:43:36] predestination the other time he said
[1:43:38] from
[1:43:41] predestination you see you go back to
[1:43:44] for
[1:43:48] knowledge I hope you catch on
[1:43:51] I said listen over and
[1:43:53] over you go back to full knowledge
[1:43:56] that's back P's predestination right an
[1:43:58] election I hope you're understanding it
[1:44:00] right amen we see there's something back
[1:44:02] P for knowledge amen
[1:44:05] right
[1:44:09] amen now listen to this wording and I'll
[1:44:13] quit because having for
[1:44:16] knowledge everybody listening right
[1:44:19] having for knowledge
[1:44:21] would bring you into an
[1:44:25] existence greater than to remain without
[1:44:30] letting that forn knowledge be
[1:44:39] known so there is something back P for
[1:44:42] knowledge right and that's the Eternal
[1:44:45] God
[1:44:47] right and that Eternal God had
[1:44:53] children that he was going to see amen
[1:44:56] come
[1:44:58] forth but he would allow us to come this
[1:45:01] way to where that we would learn how to
[1:45:03] serve him and worship him and he could
[1:45:05] display his attributes to save
[1:45:10] us CU a son is always a
[1:45:18] son you didn't become seed by the new
[1:45:21] birth
[1:45:25] right right now am I quoting the prophet
[1:45:28] he said you were always wor seed that's
[1:45:30] why you could be born again that's
[1:45:34] right the new
[1:45:36] birth was what the transmitting of God's
[1:45:41] life from
[1:45:43] him down into you and I
[1:45:48] right that we could really see who our
[1:45:50] father is right that's
[1:45:56] right see then he'll never be once he
[1:45:58] come down on the day of Pentecost and
[1:46:01] brought that Soul
[1:46:04] down he'll never be self existing
[1:46:07] anymore right that's
[1:46:11] right because he exists with his people
[1:46:15] right thirst in New Birth let's stand
[1:46:18] come on brother thirst the new birth
[1:46:22] chosen in
[1:46:25] him amen
[1:46:28] before he predestinated it to come to
[1:46:33] Earth brother Dale you're just saying
[1:46:35] what all these other people said you
[1:46:37] just got a better way of explaining
[1:46:39] it I've listened to a lot of them Tred
[1:46:41] to explain it and I can't get
[1:46:44] it CU if you mess up and leave off four
[1:46:47] knowledge you have missed it
[1:46:52] you're going to
[1:46:55] predetermine and you're going to
[1:46:58] predestinate
[1:47:01] Eternity and that's not the way it
[1:47:06] is chosen in
[1:47:13] him what you think about it what we got
[1:47:16] 369 red book 369 in the red book anybody
[1:47:20] have a need are you part of
[1:47:24] him do you have eternal life dwelling
[1:47:26] within you if you do that eternal
[1:47:31] life is not see we use the word because
[1:47:34] it is because it's part in the bases
[1:47:36] that you and I are just you know there's
[1:47:38] so many of us but is it part like we
[1:47:41] call part cuz to me part means you take
[1:47:43] an apple cut it up you give away the
[1:47:44] Apple you know the parts you run out of
[1:47:46] apple in God part means you take an
[1:47:49] apple cut it up you give it out and
[1:47:51] every time you give it away there's more
[1:47:52] than what you give away you know you
[1:47:54] start out with one apple and you look B
[1:47:56] your feet and our L bush all over the
[1:47:58] place that's the way God
