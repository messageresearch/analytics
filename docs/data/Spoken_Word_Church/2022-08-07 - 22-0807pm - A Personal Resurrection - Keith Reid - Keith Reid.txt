22-0807pm - A Personal Resurrection - Keith Reid

 JOHN 5:24,25 
24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 
25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 

ZECHARIAH 14:6,7 
6And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark: 7But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light. 

65-0418M IT IS THE RISING OF THE SUN 
64) …No wonder, we've had a dark world of theology, but in the evening time there shall come Light again. There will be a resurrection in the evening time. It shall be Light at the evening time. 

65-0418M IT IS THE RISING OF THE SUN 
94) As Christ was the first One to raise, from all the prophets, and so forth; although typed in many places, He was the Firstfruits of those that slept. In the Bride, coming of Christ, coming out of the church, there'll have to be a Sheaf waved again in the last days. Oh, my! 
95) Waving of the sheaf! What was the sheaf? The first one that come to mature, the first one that proved it was a wheat, that proved it was a sheaf. 
96) Hallelujah! I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. It was waved over the people. And the first time there will come forth, for the Bride age, for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism, will be a Message, that the full maturity of the Word has turned back again in Its full Power, and being waved over the people, by the same signs and wonders that He did back there. 
97) "Because I live, ye live also," speaking to His Wife. "Because I live, ye live also." What a resurrection that that was! And what a resurrection this is, to be quickened from the dead, "to be made alive in Christ Jesus," by God's quickening Power.

house of the lord amen praise god i'm trusting god that we have a good time in the world this weekend but whether or not i'm just here for a short time and i'm gone and so i'll leave you all with it amen praise god just thank god for the wonderful fellowship you put on the inside it's going to be on the outs inside amen amen we we certainly thank god for this ministry in particular and um i've always said i thank god for the men of god who have really labored with the word of god and to feed the flock of god um we really don't have a lot of teachers around the message and those that we have they are fading away and the whole timers are fading away and those that who are there with the prophet and has testimony personal testimonies of the things that they've seen and heard you know it's going and so so we're we're moving like in another dispensation really people who we're standing there because we believe you know we weren't there we can't talk about being in the meetings because we're never in the meetings but i think there's a greater legacy in accepting the word of god amen there really and uh i i know there's people you find sometimes that they just want to find i remember their brother was with me from south africa and he just wanted to be with brother brady you just want to hear one more time one more time amen praise god but but you know i mean that that is all good that that is all good but but that's not what the message really is you know it's christ in you the hope of glory amen and and there's something that each one of us must have that is personal personal i'm not there because my father because my mom because my family you know this is a family heritage you know no i'm there because god personally by his grace has called me and um so i am holding on to this because of him amen praise god so we want to turn our bibles to uh john 5 24 25 we're going to read then we're going to read from the book of zechariah chapter 14 verse 6. amen i'd like to speak a sibling on a personal resurrection amen hallelujah a personal resurrection he's got to be risen in you amen praise god and you know i've always thought that the way we celebrate our birth days you know there's a greater birth when you were born again you know that um we as christians sometimes i was thinking that we ought to forget that day that our mama gave birth to us and start to celebrate the day when we were born again if you're really born again because if you're born again you you can't have a birth and you don't know it so you know um you've got to know so that's what we ought to celebrate amen so let us just bow our heads as we go to the word our great god and father i want to thank you god for this evening that oh god we've come together one more time and lord god we acknowledge that many are tired and want to sleep and lord god is our time or bomba not time but lord god we come again to hear your word and father lord we can't have too much of you lord god we pray that oh god you would speak to us and energize oh god or experience lord god keep our focus on you this evening the lord god as we search our own hearts and look at the things that are ahead of us oh god lord i just pray that the word of god would energize us oh god and we keep our attention bless us god and we we're so sorry sometimes lord we go overboard and we do things all over you know you out of your experience but lord god we thank you for being a gracious god to us and lord that's the reason why we stand bless all your children wherever they might be right now and we pray god that as we speak simply we might speak to your children as they have need bless us now as we look to you and believe you in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen saint john 5 and verse 24 he said verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from debt unto life verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now his when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live then over in zechariah chapter 14 and verse 6 and 7 i will read and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall come a day which shall be known unto the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light amen may the lord and his blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated at evening time it shall be like we will sing a song back when it shall be light in the heavenly time the path the glory you shall surely find amen praise god hallelujah in the messages the rising of the sun paragraph 64 he said no wonder whoever the dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light at the evening time amen and you know we look at the world today and everything is coming to its climax you know we we sing and sometimes we wonder nations are breaking israel awaking the sign of the prophets foretold the gentiles this number you know sometimes it's easy to think that we're going to continue like this all the days of our lives but you know we can look back when when kovitz truck you know i remember i was on the airplane on my way to east africa when i first heard about kovy this this thing in china and you know i was just listening and and wondering really and by the time i get back it's sweep the entire earth and you know things that we we never thought that we would have seen i remember when our country shut down and when i said it was shot down it was shut down you know i had to go out really as a central service and you know the sound was going through my mind the marketplace is empty no more uh no the marketplace is empty no more uh something in the street the builders tools are silent no more time to harvest reap busy housewives sees their labor in the courtroom no debate time on earth is all suspended as a king come through the gate and it really felt like that there was just nothing going on everything was shut down and you couldn't believe it nobody could tell that something like that could happen but you know these things this is just a dressing room you know and he's just showing us what can happen in the twinkling of an eye you know something that started just at a little spot might be in the earth and it sweep the entire earth and you know that's the way the word of god moves that's the way god does his thing you know we used to say it's moving just like a magnet moving here moving air moving all over the atmosphere the holy ghost power is moving just like a magnet but you know the evening time we're we're under expectation for that time but we can say that time is here when it's not the morning when we can slack up and you know just goof off a little bit and you know get complacent but this is a time where something is required at your ends it is time to wake up and realize that god is moving by his spirit hallelujah and for the church hallelujah in the messages rising of the sun paragraph 94 he said as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although type in many places he was the first fruit of those that slept in the bible coming in the bright coming of christ coming out of the church there shall be a sheaf waved again in the last days waving of the sheave what was a shiva it was a first that comes to maturity hallelujah amen and maturity is really your adoption so it's the first to come to their adoption the first fruit the first one that proved that it was weave that proved that it was sheave hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time they were comfort for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark dynamic nationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the world has been turned back again to its full power that's what he says and being waived over the people by the same signs and the same wonders that he did back there you know and i thought that many times we said ah you know we're not in a sign gifted revival we're in a world revival but you know we're also coming to the time where everything that we've got needed for the bride is going to be manifested in our midst so he said because i live he shall live also speaking of his wife because i live he shall live also i'm sorry what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power i'm sorry amen give us some water yeah by god's quickening power we are quickened back to life by the word of god amen praise god amen praise god hallelujah now the bride coming of christ coming out of the church revelation 4 1 you've been called up out of little seer and you've been called up why by your revelation of the word you've been called up into the open book hallelujah you're called up you're you're separating yourself from dead dynamic nationalism into the resurrected word of god you're coming alive there's a light that is on the word that is now shining in your heart hallelujah and he said what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is hallelujah when we are separated from the church into the bright age the bride coming of christ coming out of the church when a few here and a few there are recognizing the word for their day and wherever they are they are coming together that you know we're not just here in a church and you know hallelujah i thank god if we preachers leave the world the people leave us because the people are not feeding on the preachers of today they are preaching on the they're feeding on the word of almighty god hallelujah amen in the message shalom 1 26 and today that we are now the day that we are now living god has come on the scene in a vindication and prove his promises so it is the light of the hour so we can rise and shine the light shine upon us again today the word being made manifest is the light of this hour so it comes not in words only but power and demonstration of the holy spirit brethren as long as the bride is here and the more she come into manifestation of the world all the power of god is going to be identified among the bride amen hallelujah and all that the promises of god we're going to see him in our midst really because god promised he has invested his word in us and that word in us must be alive is that right we're not just here to have a church we're not just here to set a bylaw and abide by a certain bylaw this is a bride amen this is a called out people call out of the dead enemy national and we cannot go back to what we're coming out of amen we're going to separate ourselves to the word of almighty god amen praise god so we know where we're feeding ephesians two and verse four he said and you as he quicken put yourself now in it personally who are dead in trespasses and sin when in time pass you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the year the spirit that now work in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of even as others but god hallelujah that's what we were but god who is rich in mercy hallelujah for his great love wearing he has loved us even when we were dead in sin hallelujah has quickened us together with cross by grace are we saved and has raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places hallelujah in christ jesus that in the ages to come we might show the exceedingly riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus paul placing us spiritually exactly where we are that here he was in the first session and he could look through all the ages and placed the bride of cross for this age exactly where she is is it right hallelujah it's a personal thing today amen hallelujah christ has called you out by his word you know some of us are so privileged you are here your family this was a religion of your grandparents and and your parents and and you have come to believe this really but but some of us were hiddens hallelujah but they've come to see this great light you know i've traveled africa and and i've realized that you know the the traditional belief of the people is ancestral worship and so they've never been converted to anything what they believe is ancestral worship and with ancestral worship is witchcraft because that's the highlight of their ancestral worship you know i remember being in nigeria you know in in the hotel room and looking across and seeing the people right at their their gate and they're they're they're doing their their little thing really and the fire come up and they make their sacrifice and and all of that really i said my god if they could only know jesus christ hallelujah but there are times also that we've got a challenge hallelujah witchcraft i remember i was traveling hallelujah you you know kampala and you know i noticed the fruit vendors at the end of the day they they seem to walk away and leave their fruits right there you know it's not covered it's it's just right so i said to the brother why is it they leave it just like that then he said brother keith he said they believe in witchcraft and they practice witchcraft and you dare not touch their produce or else you're going to pay and i said man and we put locks on our doors is that right who are christians but they it's witchcraft and if somebody take it then they said they've got to pay hallelujah i said man i know my god is bigger than that i remember that they're taking me to bosnia it's right on the border between uganda and kenya in other words you could just walk across and you're in kenya and you step back and you're in uganda so it's right on the border and so you know the brother said oh there's a girl that i would love you for you to pray for i said okay i'm i'm his guest so wherever i go i go and you know he took me through the houses there's there's no property boundary that's what they just put a hose where there's a vacant spot and and so we walked through this house israel and i was wondering i wonder if he knows where he's going because because you know you're going through like a maze but i remember it it take me to this place and you know i when there was two little girls on the outside and they they had like a cold pot and they had pieces of meat and like they were roasting it looks like goat or something like that they were roasting it on the fire and i was just thinking that maybe you know just kids playing you know and so but we we parted this curtain and we we went and as soon as i stepped at the door i could hear the groan you know like that that deep goblin ground you know and i look across and it's a little girl she was lying in a couch and you know covered to her face and you know she was awesome and groaning really and so you know the brother comes in and they begin to explain to me that she belongs to a relative of a family that is in the message and they begin to tell me you know um two weeks ago or or older sister die and as soon as the sister died she said that the demons tell her that she's going to be next and immediately they buried her sister she got sick and this was about two weeks after you know she was lying there so they they took her they were edens the family's eden and so they took her to these believers house and and they leave her there and you know i was listening through the interpretation it had to be two interpreters really and so i was listening but you know seeing that girl i said oh old is she he said she's 15 years old and i felt that compassion so i i step across and you know i went and i sit on her bed and i put my hands on her forehead she was running a fever as a lord jesus if you were here you would have raised this child and this child would not have died lord in the name of jesus rise this child from this sickness and brothers that little girl the the groaning stop and she opened her eyes and she turned around and she sit up she moved that covering off her and she sit up and pastor uh says that i was with pastor um samuel and he said give her something to eat and you know they first gave her water and she drink and you could see she was weak because she has not eaten for a long time but you know as i i went back across and i i sit down and you know that moment had just taken us over that this girl just rise up from this sickness and she's sitting there and it begins to come to my mind i see this woman walking on a little dirt track and she was coming and she had like two escort that was going with her and in my mind that was demons carrying her really and something tell me she's going to be there i felt her presence before she reached and soon she parted the curtain she was in a yellow dress and she stand right there before us and she was looking her daughter she was surprised or she was dumbstruck because her daughter was well and i said to her why is the demons trying to kill your children and she began to express and you know the brothers were telling me what she was saying she said her husband has taken another woman and she sent the demons to kill all of her seven children and this was number two that was going to be taken and i tell her i said the god who showed me that the demons are with you that same god says none of your children will die i began to talk to her and right there she fall down on her feet and begin to confess her sins to jesus christ amen that was wednesday amen that that was wednesday and on the weekend we baptized her and her daughter her daughter was skipping around really she was happy because god had healed her so the next evening i was brother um samuel ortega house and some men from the town they're coming and so they wanted to see me because they know that family at town they come in and say they wanted to see me because they know that family and they're all edens and how did you get them to be converted i said jesus christ it's greater than witchcraft amen he's certainly greater than witchcraft i tell you there's coming a day when we'll have to stand up on what we believe because there's no god in this world that is more powerful than the god who we serve amen hallelujah and you know she followed me everywhere i go and they had problems because the language you speak most times nobody i'll speak it really so somebody had to sit beside her and try to interpret her and you know she didn't have the basic concepts of christianity but what she know that the god who raised up her daughter hallelujah and enter into her life that god is a true god hallelujah i know that as long as that woman live that testimony is going to be with her and as long as that girl live that testimony is going to be with her hallelujah that's all resurrection something's going to happen in your life an experience that you've got with god that as long as you live you will never forget that experience you know i noticed you know uh brother brady being my pastor for all these years and there's something about brother brady if you know him and you talk to him a little bit he goes back to 1965. and he begins to share with you his testimony when he meet the prophet because that experience that he had back then it was a personal experience with jesus christ and as long as he lived he cannot get past that experience but brethren there's a greater experience with god than that for you that day when he enters into your heart amen your personal resurrection [Music] you know i when something happens when i'm when there's a manifestation of the power of god people becomes drawn to it really and so as i said you know it says it comes not in words only we we can sit and quote quotes and tell the time that we're living in but listen something must follow that word and if we would believe god and don't doubt whatever we want from god he will grant it to us so the the the news spread back to kampala and so the brothers were calling me you know to come back to kampala because we have planned a meeting in kampala we want you to come back to kampala but i was here on this side on the eastern side and brothers i met 11 ministers and so 11 pastors came together for a meeting my brother there was not even a bicycle they all walk their feet you you know in in in africa there they they have what they call buddha buddha it's a motorbike really and that's the taxi you know i tell you i've been on it about two times and brother oh lord hallelujah you know i want to grab him and hold on but you know it's so you got to put your hands behind your brother i'll tell you amen but you know that that's what you know somebody had to drop one off and and you know listening to these brothers they're they're hard workers for the gospel everything in their lives around spreading this message i said man i got to spend time with them but then you know i i left and i went to kampala and um i preached in kampala you know the brothers on the east they tell me they said ah they were calling you you know they're trying to let the people be filled with the holy ghost and and jumping over i said man that's what i really want because if you ain't got the holy ghost you ain't got nothing i don't care what you want to do when you receive him as long as you receive him amen because listen until that day of the revelation of jesus christ's personally to you you just associated with message people brethren like jesus said to nicodemus you must be born again that is the experience of your life you must be born again you must have that personal resurrection in your life then you can stand tall no devil can defeat me because in the name of jesus i remember i was over in liberia and i'd preach and you know the young people just pour into the altar and so you know i was going through and i was praying for them there at the altar and and the brother comes and he whispered in my head he said brother keith there's a woman here that is possessed with the devil she's been insane for a long time you want to pray for her and i didn't even look around maybe if i'd look around brother when i said no so i i said yes and when i turned around this woman they were they were holding on to her and she was like a raging bull she was mad as we would say back room i turned around i said in the name of jesus christ i've never come out of her and that woman that was raging she just swiveled down on the floor and she was postured on the floor and immediately she started to snore she went into a deep sleep that unclean spirit recognized the voice of god and leave out of her really [Applause] when brother caleb duke and took me from the church he said brother keith he said you heard her snore i said certainly he said you believe she's there i said brother she's totally whole she will never again be mad you know why because it's not the first time i've seen that amen the unclean spirit come out of that person and they go right into a deep sleep when they awake from that sleep they'll never be the same again that's the power of the god that we serve because it comes not in words only but in power and demonstration of the holy spirit amen amen so you know they heard what happened in bosnia so they bring me to kampala and now in kampala it was a very established church and you know i was showing you pictures of them dancing today i love those people because they're you see something you you'll sing and you'll you'll clap your and maybe you swing your body but you don't move your feet but we jamaicans when we when we sing when we go to church we move everything [Laughter] amen praise god amen that's just so we are we there's just a dance in us really amen when we go to church we dance some people say well you shouldn't dance in church well david dance and amen god honor him i i tell him i said listen god rebuked david for taking you ra's wife god rebuked david for counting israel but god never rebuked him for dancing before the lord until his clothes drop off so if you've got a problem with it gotta go ask god because god said that's a man after my own heart hate that praise god hallelujah you know i'm crazy but i'm all right amen you know people said well you you're not intellectual enough i tell you what i've got three degrees there and that didn't change me because when i got the holy ghost it changed everything about me amen praise god you know the brothers were talking they're one of the brothers and lecturers said hey i've got a master's degree in business he said brookie you gotta i said yes it's right there and he didn't change me because when you got the holy ghost it doesn't matter what else you got people say well the education will change it certainly didn't change me but you know what those who are around me when i go to school they are all christians [Laughter] amen praise god in the easter seal he said so we are easter amen we are now in our easter we have already raised hallelujah from the things of the world to the things of god's promise the promise of god no not we will we are it's the potentials amen so i've been to kampala and manatee it was a real established church you know real established people but we had a good time so out of that experience you know they they invited me back so i was there in september and they invited me back in um december and we had now a meeting i get a chance now to go to the far west of uganda but you know i should tell you really that before i've ever went to uganda in 2019 i i i was invited to ghana and i went to ghana but before i left for ghana the lord tell me he wants me to go to uganda the only person i can remember in uganda was steve nibali brother um tim amity i know those brothers really but i was online one day and i saw pastor samuel ortega and like the lord said to me that's the brother i should go to and so that's what i went to in the east so they invited me back in december and i went to fort portal and the the way they do their convention really they rent a school this was a secondary school they rent the entire building because school was out and so all the people travel and they stay they camp in the schools for the meetings really and they bring food they bring cassava and banana and all that really and beans you know i was thinking i said man there's no meat and i can remember the first um day of the meeting really um the the buses did not arrive with all the food so all they had was cassava so what they did they they just simply roast the cassava and these hundreds of people they just eat cassava and everybody was contented and they drink water and they went to bed i said man my lord sometimes we've got so much and we still complain amen but they were satisfied with whatever they had because they were under great expectation for the word of god amen you know that meeting i was really challenged because the the brothers claim that they they've never seen no manifestation of the holy spirit that was an insult but you know what god came down and confirmed his word there were so many things happening that they had to take one service for the people to testify of the acts of healing and deliverance and the baptism of the holy ghost that they had received really and i saw one brother he's a minister and i preached and i was true and he started to prophesy but what i recognized was happening he was calling the ministers the people by name and he was like telling them what god says i never seen anything like this before so you know i usually so wet when i re so i go and i i change that was an experience because in the bathrooms really you know you've got a seat to sit on it's just a hole in the ground so you you go down and you you know like when i was a cadet i've never been a sober you gotta shuffle until you you align properly and uh i said but man this must be hard for the whole people no because they've done that all their lives so it's easy for them really but you know i remember i go to change and i came back and the brother got so weak his he just went off his feet really i took him up and i i hugged him and i prayed for him and he got his foot in back you know his name is brother talent he is a gifted minister i saw him wherever ever know and every time i have a problem in my family or so i wrote by the talent he's just tremendous warrior for god amen precious people you know one minister came to me and he said brother keith he said for seven years i had a back problem he said i've suffered in pain and he said but when you say do you believe he said i held my hand in the ear and he said the seven years of problems of pain he said it left me at that minute because that's what we need we need to believe we need to believe and i was really sharing with them the story of brother branham and the squirrels and you know brother brahms said when he did not find the fort squirrel and he went back to camp brother tony prayed and brother tony says lord if brother branham is talking the truth let him find the fort's krill brother branham was hurt in his feelings because he said brother tony had a wife that was crippled on the cut and i prayed for her and she recovered and he's doubting me so when he went back to the hunting site he was under pressure and he went and he looked where the scroll is supposed to be and he said i couldn't find it but the word was did you not say because if you say and believe god will bring it to pass brethren your healing is not so far from you if you would take childlike fate in all of it really god is obligated the prophet said god will bankrupt heaven before he let one promise and that is for the bride amen and just sharing that with them it put their faith into a frenzy if you would say if you would believe god will operate in your body do you believe and the healing virtues of god swept through that place thousands of people people want to share their testimony but there was no time but the mighty god unveiled before us amen and so oh so they they invited me back 2020 easter because they wanted to see something like that again and i couldn't go but when i went back this year i didn't preach the manifestation because brethren the manifestations of the holy spirit is an attraction we're not the only ones that have it we've got the word to back up every promise of god because there's people who are just signed seekers if they can see a sign but the message means more than the manifestation of the holy spirit but the manifestation tells you that god is there the manifestation in brother branham's life if if that was not there many of you wouldn't even be here i had a brother one time in church well he's still in church but when he take a message book he doesn't read from the front or where the scripture is read he go to the back after the message is finished and brother branham begin to pray for the sick and that's the portion of it he reads because he's trapped in that and the word doesn't mean he'll go around and he'll tell everybody about the things that happen but the word he didn't even read that part he will never have deliverance and he will never come to the revelation of the word of god because that's not it amen it's the word being restored to you and the word is restored then every promise of god is also restored to you amen hallelujah so i went back in easter and i begin i i've seen that you know when you have a place where somebody preach that the seven thunder is the seventh virtues then you know it leads the people off and they they know it's not exactly but what is going to bring them back to the true word and so people become scared of certain things really and and so once you speak of the seven seals they they begin to you know back off but they had confidence because they had seen a mighty move of god amen and so i preach the opening of the word and i show them that the message is not signs and gifts but because god opened those seals to us and our records will search all the way back we have redemption by that word brother stephen that was with me at camp meeting he said brother keith your mighty help to the ministers and i hear them say well i'm going back to read that book because many of them they've heard they've never read it right we're encompassing this mountain of the first and second pole and they're trapped there but let me say this to you and this might just be me but whatever problems are in your life if you go to a church and it's not preach it's not helping you it's not going to help you really you see when a demon is exposed it will go from you and if you are bound by anything the word is what releases you from it really so you know you notice that what happened if there's polygamy they stick together because that spirit keep them together and so when a when when a man is preaching the gospel and he's got two living wives and others come right there beside him and a spirit listen lord do you slay me yet will i trust you sin is sin unbelief is unbelief not because you'd walk the devil let you walk a road and it leaves a scar in your life god will remove that scar god will remove that complex don't rally around the spirit that bound you no run from it run from it because if the words don't release you what's going to do it amen that's where i am you know it's like you tell your children like when you were young and you caught you you were perfect and they're looking at you and they're now seeing the things that are happening and and they said man you must have lived in a perfect world you know after you many times your children are smarter than you are because i find that every generation is smarter than the one before brother dale and stephanie when you were young you you thought that you hey but when we came up really we know more than you know back then and our children today you said you're going to tell them the facts of like oh we know that already because it's online you're afraid to talk about it really it's taboo but it's everywhere around them the music that that is playing well you know your society is different from ours but our children has got to take maybe a taxi to school they're going to take a taxi back home the music and i'll tell you there's something about jamaica we are a small country of 200 quarter million people but we are known throughout the world by our music by our food if it's sports you know jamaica i was in uganda and i'm in the hotel and i can't sleep because reggae music is stomping down the road so you thought you traveled all these thousands of miles you're away from it notice in the heartbeat of the people how did we ever get there i was up in liberia in the slum and on the the maras that the wall full of fungus and all of that they write gully and gaza you don't know what that is but that comes right from kingston jamaica it's our musicians when they polarize themselves and fight they take side and all the way among the poverty-stricken people they embrace that we we export the worst of the worst of the worst just a few years ago i could say 90 of our women wear dress or a skirt brother i tell you not today and if you think in new york they they're naked come over to jamaica and you will see the music today it is the lowest of the degrading of the lowest that ever was come out of human lips and that is what our children are hearing and to come around and have to deal with that i tell families really you can't just let your children go by you've got to sit with them around the table you've got to know what they know and what they've got to go through because you've got to beat that demon out of them if they come up and stand up it takes the grace of god the fact that my children can go anywhere and they're still a christian it's not because of me it's because of the grace and the mercies of almighty god because you know i was writing a paper doing a business degree and and there was a musician that we were supposed to critique is is music and man i'll tell you what i never heard the music because i don't listen and worse i wouldn't know what it said but i come home and i say it and daniel she was in high school she wrote the lyrics and gave to me word by word by word and she's baptized but if you travel in a taxi at a place every day somehow when i listen i just yeah [Music] we say all we hear is booga wagga booga but they hear every word and that's what they've got to deal with that's just the truth that's just the truth so that's why sometimes you gotta you know take them in your hands pray for them and ask god to have mercy because the age that they're going through spiritually you you know it's bad but the things that they've got to deal with certain words in school we never say it no you can't say that but it's cool today oh my lord so we know as we look at you that's why we pray for you young people because we know the devil is in your corner but the blood of jesus christ is on you and he will save you from all of that he will save you from all of that [Applause] and when he gives you a personal resurrection no devil can stop you that's why in a church you know sometimes we you guard your children you don't want the deacons to talk to them you don't want nobody say anything to your children if they talk to you you get offended you ought to be happy when when they help you with your children amen because it takes the grace of god you can't do it yourself in africa they said it takes a community to grow a child you know when i was growing up really though i mean naturally if you do something on the road that wasn't right anybody any adult could whip your skin yeah that's that's the way it is amen my mama thank god for her when she whip us really she save it until everybody was guilty of something then she did it one time you you had no time to laugh at nobody because once you start with one you you wait your turn because everybody's going to get it really sometimes you start one what did i do but you know you're going to get it but what a promise god has given to us but when you have a personal resurrection it doesn't matter the society you live in it doesn't matter things you go through god is able to keep that which you have committed unto him against that day hallelujah amen praise god in the easter seal paragraph 122 if we are ordained on that drone if you are ordained to be under that ground like the eagle walking in the chicken nest if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is here to find you and when it finds you you recognize its call you know the hour we're living you know that these things are supposed to happen quickly you are raptured up to meet it and now we are sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus hallelujah in christ the mystery of god reveal paragraph 484 he said his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word its promise for for the day expressing itself through you a vindication of the great revelation of god look only in an individual never in a group you've got to have your personal revelation of who jesus christ is you can't go on nobody else's experience i think joshua for all them 40 years he could have gone and said moses tell me one more time moses would have re rehearsed what happened in mount sinai but joshua before he get to jordan god gave him his own experience he met the man so he didn't dwell on moses experience i met the man with the sword and he said take off your shoes from off your feet amen hallelujah you've got to meet god for yourself don't take a false sense of security i'm in the message no sir stay there with it until god shine the light in your life and you've got your resurrection amen then you are sure you are sure that when you say it god act upon it amen hallelujah an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual hallelujah not with the methodists not with the baptist not with the presbyterian not with the lutheran not with a pentecostal but as an individual i'll take one i leave one i'll separate them there'll be two in the field one shall be taken hallelujah there'll be two in the bed and one shall be one take one and leave one hallelujah amen yes sir we are called the bride of jesus christ amen you know you know in the spoken word the original seed brother brown said she's not his wife yet amen when that seal was open and the revelation of jesus christ come down to the bride he said i call you bride amen you're the wife of god amen then christ the mystery of god revealed he said the bride pregnant pregnant with the seed word of god she couldn't be pregnant unless she was married so we go to the marriage supper of the lamb you know who you are the words speak of you and you know where you're standing hallelujah so you're gathering around the caucus word of almighty god brethren when we go there in the world we speak to the world we know what we're talking about because god will back up his word amen i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ for the power of god unto salvation i will challenge any witch doctor amen i will challenge the heathen because i know that my god is bigger than your god hallelujah praise god amen in question and answer 1964 paragraph 239 i'll be quick said matthew 24 28 for wheresoever the carcasses there will the eagles be gathered together who is the carcass and who is the eagle now that's a good question nothing's wrong with that he said what is the carcass the carcass is what the eagle feed on now an eagle is considered in the bible a prophet a prophet is an eagle god called himself an eagle and we are eaglets the believers and what is the caucus that they feed on it is the word of god wheresoever the word is the true nature of the bird will show itself an eagle which wants fresh meat he must have is fresh meat not a buzzard not he's an eagle you can't no denominational stuff won't hold you hallelujah what a great thing we have been called out by an eye calling amen praise god hallelujah amen we've got fresh food today it is a word that promise for this hour hallelujah and it's got to make manifest in this day that's where the eagles are where the carcass is the word and so when the word comes don't call up and say well we've got the word no put the word in action god's word is action because wherever god's word is it must manifest itself amen hallelujah brethren there's a world out there that need god there's a bride out there that needs to come up to the full revelation of the world and it's going to take you and i think amen you know if we live in the place where we're worrying about our yesterday we're worrying about this we're worrying hey you know i've seen people who don't have the things that we have they don't have the comfort that we have but they are happy people i watched them people dancing and they answered the brother telling me he said brother keith he said their call is their greatest possession because you know they they cattle the brother steve was telling me say i'm going back because my my daughter is getting married i said man you had to pay the dory he said ten calls i i like that system though because i have two daughters i i don't know why you'd never make that in the west really but hey i might need my coats really [Laughter] hallelujah that's just who i am the anointed ones in the end time 269 i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performed these things and foretell these things that happen as perfect as they are i was only that one near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to hallelujah that is spoke true it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it is god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ and he is the one that we are feeding on all little eagles that's who we're feeding on we're not feeding on a man a man his word will fail but we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man when we go for it we know who we are you know brother wade you said well i i never had an act of healing in my ministry i've never had that you don't worry about it you just say what your desire is and what god perform it and when you have confidence that god will keep his word then when the devil presents something say the word of god and watch god do the rest because brother branham said it wasn't me it was it wasn't the seventh angel it was the son of man and if the word is with us if we are that people if we are the wife of almighty god wherever we go the manifestation of the word will bring hallelujah the vindication that god is here with us [Music] we live below our privileges hallelujah because we are afraid to put god on the stand to put him to the test but listen if you will believe god will do the rest you believe that hallelujah oh let me close right here in romans 8 and verse 10 and if christ be in you the word amen the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but the spirit of him that rays of jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by spirit that dwells in you therefore brethren we are adapters not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh we shall die but if we truly the spirit do mortify bring to the undertaker the deeds of our body he shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and the prophet of god said before god let one promise come to doubt he will bankrupt all of heaven what an investment in you and i it's not because we don't have it it's because we don't take the confidence by the world to see god manifest in our lives really amen whatever we stand in need of you know god wants to meet your need before you even have that need you believe that amen god want to heal your sicknesses before that sickness befall you but you've got to believe if god would really teach us as believers to take childlike faith in his word nothing will stand before us nothing will stand before us you know i thank god that i can be a blessing i thank god that i can go well it takes faith first of all to go i i remember i was in johannesburg and i'm thinking i should i was on my way back home from zimbabwe and i stopped over to see the brethren and i was thinking i said what is this that i've put on myself brother i was thinking of a flight to new york of 18 and a half hours and i said i don't like flying i'm afraid of flying really because i'm afraid of not having control you know if the plane shifter i'm wondering i wonder if he's having a problem because i'm the kind of person i solve problems really i've got a group of let um engineers and technicians so about 38 of them really and you know when they have a problem they tell me i tell them what to do so when there's a shake or a rattle i'm wondering you know i hate flying but i've got to do it the only reason i will do it is because of the grace and the mercies of almighty god because i know that he sent me and i will go amen and you know i want you all to remember this one thing i'm a product of this church you you might not know that but i can recite my notes that samuel dale preached many years ago word for word the quotes that he use because that was my teacher to bring me into the revelation of the word of god and i go to there i go today to be a blessing and i thank god i tell them back home i've never preached a message and put it out that i have to take it back no by the grace of god amen and have prayed for sickness and they are healed in the name of jesus because i believe and i believe with the restoration of that word to us the power of god must be in our midst but sometimes we get too complacent to what god has already given to us really but you know in the bible it says capernaum all capernaum if the mighty works that were done in you were done in sodom and gomorrah they would have repented we ought to recognize what's in our midst amen and the word of god that has been invested in us really let us not take it lightly because when the word is put to test it brings forth the manifestation of god amen and um am i going to go again i'm certainly going to go and i'm certainly going to do more and i pray god give me the strength he said bro keith how do you afford it i put it on my credit card and god take care of it some other time you know i was telling a brother i said the money that i was giving to the people the brothers in uganda i had it from 2019 and i had it in an envelope in my draw because when somebody give me an offering i use it for the mission field and so i use what i have and god provide god is a mighty provider and if this word is a truth then god would want it to be preached right across the globe and if you don't go i will go and if you can't go send me because i will go and i will take it and let the word of god live again in the body of the believers may god bless you may god bless you lulu i've had many friends over the years but i thank god for this church and for the love and for the word of god that when fought you know and so i remember some years ago when we i invited brother dale to come and preach for bishops cars convention because he said i want a teacher to um preach in my convention and bring brother dale i heard many ministers criticize do you you know and what they'll say did you tell them about brother burnham no he told him about jesus christ he preached the revelation of jesus christ that's what he preached amen and brother we you were there we can see them you know bickering there in the congregation because some say they are jesus only some said because the word was dividing them and that's what we need today if you've got the word what did you do with it let us realize let's not get slutful in this last little hour this is the evening time and if there are those to hear it let them hear it send it out and let them hear it if you are tired of it say it let them hear it really because this word is going to prepare a bride for a rapture and god said it and it cannot fail amen may god bless the people of god and may we keep the fire burning until the day of jesus christ god bless you god bless you can stand on your feet amen praise god of the message of the hour he just happened to meet dad a long time ago and become a someone that would listen if somebody listen every once in a while they might get something right you but like he said a lot of people don't want teaching anymore they think it's boring they think it's uh um doesn't have any power well it does have power the word of god has power always has power before we get before we start on our communion let's just bow our heads if you have a need just raise your hands if you have a need we'll we'll pray over those needs and then we'll go right into communion and foot washing and just lift our hands and if you need something we won't have to come up here to the to the altar i believe brother keith preached the word of god today i believe he's opened the channel for you to have faith for you to have faith and not just him but faith in the word because the words what backed him up he didn't back him up the word backed him up we have no power at all we're given power by god and it's through the word of god and power and demonstration so let's pray dear heavenly father lord we've heard a wonderful message lord a testimony of a of a man that went to another country and was challenged by many demons well lord we may not be in foreign countries but we get challenged by those same demons every day the demons of this or that of the other it doesn't really matter we have them here in the states they have them overseas they have them in jamaica but we've got one god and jesus christ is his name and that one name there's no other name under heaven whereby men can be saved and that doesn't mean all just saved that means saved from sickness saved from demon powers lord is your name and we're the only people that have your name lord there's only one jim dale there's only one bride of jesus christ and we are connected straight to you and lord today as we have our hands up lord of the needs of the people father i pray that you'd be with each one lord touch the knees i know there's many of us that have loved ones that are lost loved ones that are sick prayer requests coming in of

sister that you touch each one of us lord sister freda different ones that are battling different things lord we pray that you just be with them lord touch them give them lord a word you said you'd

of of people being saved even when getting ready to take communion they give the heart to the lord and continue on well lord this is an ordinance that you said to do until you come and lord we're

mom and dad's 64th wedding anniversary and thank our visitors for coming to be with us so let's turn if you want to and read with us in first corinthians 11 23 paul is coming and telling us what the uh what the lord say come to the lord's table and he gets a revelation he wasn't there that night but he got a clear understanding and a clear revelation of what went on god give it to paul to give it to us to break it down just like this for i have received of the lord that which i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he breaking and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood he had to die to become a new testament so he's telling them he's getting ready to go but he's going to come back the cup is the new testament in my blood this you do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sure the lord's death until he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself thank god paul thank you paul give us an out give us a way to get us give us away so we can take this communion amen but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that is and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation and to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world thank god wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger lady meet at home that you come down into condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come so let's just take a moment of silent prayer clearing our mind out clearing our heart out getting everything out of the way brother brown said pray for your pastor all right let's pray for brother dale let's pray for the deacons and all the preachers and all the all the ones in the church and let's get our minds clear so we can take communion and when we take this communion we're going to remember that there was a man died on the cross and this is in symbol what we're going to go through today is a symbol that he told us to do until he comes so we're going to do this according to what god said so that that way when you eat the bread and you drink the the cup you're doing what god said amen so if you have a need if you have a something in your body if you have if you need salvation take that cup take that bread and take the communion because he said he would bless us will not come into condemnation amen let's have a moment of silent prayer we thank you lord for all things jesus name we pray amen the bible said he took the bread and he blessed the lord this is made by holy hands every time we do this i remember way back long time ago when mom and dad used to serve the communion in the baptist church and they'd take it out of the freezer and it was held over and it was just a little small wafer but lord that's not what you said to do we're not going to hold over any revelation when this is over with tonight we're going to take this bread home we're going to burn it where it's inedible so that tomorrow we can get new revelation lord your body was broken one time and it was broken for me and the brothers and sisters around the world that are the pride of jesus christ so now as we look down at this bread lord i pray that you're sanctified to our bodies lord and bless us in jesus name amen yeah you know we didn't have any understanding then we were in the baptist church we'd buy that mom and dad to buy it from some kind of uh purchasing house and they don't tell who made the bread it was just a little square a little like a cracker but it was little and uh and they put it in the freezer and well not a lot of people you know took communion that sunday then you just put it back in the freezer and the next time you had communion you pulled it out of the freezer and used it again well that according to the word you're not going to do that you're not supposed to hold over what happened to the manna what happened to that manna it rot it had wiggle tails brother brown called it right why because you're not supposed to hold over the word of god it goes against new revelation tomorrow we're going to think on what brother keith said and you know what something i hope sparks in your heart and gives you a new revelation gives you a new a new thought a new process and i think that's why that uh um i was telling um somebody today if you watch some of those services brother donny and brother brother ron and even brother keith on one of the the friday morning about how we've forgotten how church was important we've forgotten that that we're supposed to come to church to worship god not see each other and not to be counted present on the board amen but to what to come in here and worship god in spirit and truth not see your neighbor that's why we don't congregate inside here when it's not a lodge we go downstairs if we need to talk to somebody if you want to see somebody you see them outside because this is a place that we're here to do one thing and that's worship god that's all we're here to worship god not a man we're here to worship god amen amen and we know who he is we don't have to stumble around and wonder if it's the second person coming today or the third person coming today it's the only person that's coming today the only person's gonna show up he's the father son and holy ghost so we can't lose right amen amen your heavenly father this wine has been made also by holy hands and it's been put through a process lord of fermentation and lord it's come to where it gives new stimulation every time we take it lord it gets better and better lord as a word of god that we hear today lord and next week and the week after lord that it will never go void is but the key said it will always accomplish what it said it would father i pray that you should be with us lord and sanctify us lord as we take this communion lord may as we reach and get this cup and reach and get this bread lord that will realize that you died god almighty and human flesh died to save our soul and we're giving this little time back to you lord that you told us to do it till you come father then we're going to be sitting around that table up lord in another dimension while all hell's going to be breaking loose down here on earth but we're going to be sitting in a place warren where we're going to take communion and be there for three and a half years lord while you work with your jews down here on earth lord thank you for that lord i thank you that we know where we're going we know where we come from we know where we're going we know what we're doing here too lord i pray this should bless us now in jesus name amen amen come morning i walk by the river i'll rest need ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected if you preach the word long enough you will and i want oh father how long then i take one more look at mount calvary and it gives me the strength to go on good morning i'll walk by the river brother brown says sometime in the morning between six and nine o'clock something's gonna sweep down and it's gonna pick up his saints and we're gonna go to a marriage supper and we're gonna have joy our bodies is going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye the wine is going to taste much better and so is the bread because in those glorified bodies everything is enhanced everything is greater a greater taste you know brother branham said one time he said god you know he's got an eye but a better eye than we have he's got a a brain a better brain than we have i like what as as we were talking about the other day and brother keith was bringing out in in ruth how that um the brother brown and preach christ the mystery of god revealed on the seventh month the 28th day and we were talking about last night how their brother brought him on the seventh seal you could tell he was struggling a little bit trying to trying to find the right words to say and he really wasn't he wasn't happy about it if you'll read your seal book he actually takes part of the sermon and cuts it out inside the tabernacle and goes over to a motel with two brothers and re-tapes it because he wasn't satisfied with the first time he was looking for something but oh my on july the 28th he knew what that seventh seal was which is christ in you the hope of glory christ is the mystery of god reveal he said let's go back in the back part of god's mind nobody ever been there before let's go back in the back part of god's mind and let's bring him down today and what was that whole book doing showing who you are where you came from what you're doing here and where you're going thank god for a prophet y'all people can bash him all they want to he brought me to god he gave me a revelation that no other i can't listen to no other preacher and get what i get from william branham i promise you that and then the fivefold ministry that absolutely breaks it down and and lets us know exactly that love letter brother brown gave us a big long love letter but in between that love letter we got more lines that the the fivefold ministry is saying this is what god said about you this is what god said about you this is what god said about what you blessed people we are what a group of people we've become we we um i was telling the other day brother keith we've got more musicians on the stage than we had we had congregation the first time we had we had church here a little humble beginnings of uh of uh the the pulpit was right here the window was right there the window was right here and there was a door right there that went out into the into the almost into the end of the road and the pulpit was there and there were seats sitting right here we had just a small amount of people at that time but look what it's become you preach the word of god as brother dale's done and give us a good foundation i'll promise you god's going to honor it because it won't return void it'll accomplish what it said it was going to accomplish so now generations brother keith myself different ones the generations is coming up now we take the word of god and we can preach the word of god and give it to the people like we're supposed to amen and i can remember even coming to the church brother john when we only use one of them one of those um levels is about all we used and we didn't have to use it all and here we are almost getting two so i thank god that means you're taking communion because it's clear in your mind it's clearing your soul that birth is happening because we listen we're going when we read this about the um the foot washing he told peter he looked right at peter and he said if you don't do this you have no part with me now how much clear is that that's not some that's not what brooke keith said that brother brady said that brother wade said that brother dale said no that's what god said to peter if you don't do this you ain't got no part with me and if you don't take communion in the foot washing you don't have part with god get born again and you'll want to do this you'll not want you'll not be ashamed to reach and get the cup you'll not be ashamed to reach and get the bread because you know what we're required to do that that's right god told us these things to do put it in the word made it very clear for us to take communion so let's take communion thank you lord while they're taking those up let's go ahead and read the scripture now when we're finished the sisters will go downstairs there's place provided down there for you to wash feet and then there'll be a space up here provided for the men and like i said before make sure you stay reverent oh don't go downstairs and laughing and talking until everybody's finished because it's a solemn time i don't believe they were having a party in the upper room i believe it was a solemn time jesus was getting he was within 24 hours of losing his life and he had to go to the garden afterwards so he knew that this was the last time he was going to have physical contact with his disciples and the devil was going to do what he did and and then this is what's going to happen but jesus watch what he said if you want to read along in john john chapter 13 and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judas this carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet it's not gonna be that we gonna have on our izods and our and our whatever kind of socks we got on and hoes we got on and we've had nice shoes put on our feet and we've not walked 25 miles in the in the cow pasture they had the water was probably pretty dirty but jesus was going to finish what he started he didn't stop in the middle of it he washed all of his feet if he can do that so can we if god can wash feet we ought to wash each other's feet after that he poured water in the basement and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel who with he was girded then it cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord lest thou wash my feet jesus answered and said what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never watch he's pretty adamant you know you're not you're never gonna wash my feet in other words i'm never gonna allow you to do this because because this is something a servant should do well jesus is fixing to tell him to tell him that he is the servant jesus answered and said if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter said unto him lord not only in my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him he that is washing it is not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken his garment and was set down again he said unto them know you what i've done to you is the question you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am now watch he's elevated himself i'm mastering lord you say well for so i am now watch what he done he's going to come right back down and be the servant all right if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example he was the example i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you very verily i say unto you look the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things i like this happy happy if you begrudgingly wash somebody's feet you need to get in the altar all right i tell you brother tom ernest impressed me more than anything that day we were we were getting ready to wash feet and we'd never watch feet before brother clauds and he got down you know brother tom's big guy his biggest his brother donnie and uh and uh y'all just remember sister sandy because he passed away a couple of days ago one year will be a one-year anniversary he died of covet but love brother tom is the good brother and the lord we'll see him again but he looked down at me he looked up at me and he said brother wait he said it's a privilege to wash your feet can we say that it's a privilege and he meant what he was saying it's a privilege to be able to wash your feet not that i have to pick mine out and go i think i'm going to get brother donnie over there because i know his feet don't stink come on somebody i wash everybody's feet wouldn't bother me a bit amen but that's the way we do happy are you if you do this let's bow our heads let's tell brother keith how much we appreciate him one more time before we do and as he continues on we pray that the lord will bless him and and we're going to be blessed in a few weeks by his wife and the two daughters are coming daddy's got to go home and do the work while the while the wife and the two daughters are going to be here with us so monique and danielle and and sister francine are going to be with us in a few weeks so we pray that uh that we'll be able to uh to give them some southern hospitality because we always get real so they're more southern than we are they're from jamaica we get real southern hospitality when we go to their house but just pray for him as he continues on let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day thank you for the ones that are among us lord the ones that's visiting in lord and the one lord has been here like i said before that labors and and that labor will not be in vain lord if we'll just do what you said there's so many promises that we take for granted lord but we're going to try i pray that we all in this building that will that we'll try and brother keith said there's got to be a resurrection there's got to be something coming out of dark denominationalism you said well i left the message i mean i left the denominations 20 years ago but it hasn't left you that's my question tonight has it left us as people lord come out of her my people is the cry that you're crying now lord so that the son of man can be manifested that when we do come up to a situation that we can look that situation right in the face and say what a mighty god that we serve the greatest god there is no other god there is no other lord there is no other spirit greater than
