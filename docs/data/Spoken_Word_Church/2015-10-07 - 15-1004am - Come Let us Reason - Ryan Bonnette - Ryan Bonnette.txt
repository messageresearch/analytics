========================================

okay morning everybody so last time which was April the last time I taught you now we all remember probably what I thought it was a long time ago about six months ago I guess I thought about come let us reason all right I'm going to try to get back into that but I never finished it now how do you pull up something from the bottom which one of these would be far ahead open is it in there but before we get into that subject I'm going to talk about perfect love because this is something I've been thinking about here lately and I don't know how long time to talk about this but I hope to get back into come let us reason because I never finished it and they were just do a quick review where we got up to and then finish that you see how going get but you know brother branham talked about that we need perfect love to go to the future home and to go to heaven or where you know beyond here we have to look it's a requirement it's a prerequisite you know you have to have it but it's not something so far off that we can't attain to it if so then God would not have anybody there so it's not something so far off that we can't attain to it we know that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to review a little bit of my testimony about either everybody kept our members that are baby i was born with premature lungs and she nearly died well I want to try to delve into just the middle part of that testimony because I know I skimmed over so fast that a lot of people missed it what really happened alright so they won wednesday's she was born in four minutes to amend not on the fourth day of the week y'all never be talking about all fours how God's number of deliverance is for there's lots of fours in there well she was born and started to diminish really quickly and they took her to the NICU and she got worse and worse over the next few days by the third day by Saturday she was nearly dead hi nobody had told us by that time that she was dying it was parental intuition I guess you could say or instinct we know because it's her baby this time we know she's done nabasa tell us and Gavin I didn't talk about it we didn't use the D work we didn't even discuss that she was done but as we stats that they were watching her that Saturday the thing that came to my mind is that scripture about having done all to stand you stand which to me means you read your Bible you pray you go to church keeping everything you do you stand for Christ no matter what and it's easy sometimes but sometimes it's really hard when you're facing adversity so I told guy who would need to stand literally and go to church even though we're watching our baby died and I didn't say that work with her I didn't use the word and confess it I didn't like you think about her night but I knew we had to leave and go to church so we went and that was a Bible study night and we cried all the way to church we caught all during church and then at the end of it by the way spoke those words to me or God through by the way he spoke the words to me that I believe turned the whole thing around so I received what I had need up just for her healing right there but what if I had been there you know but my point is what we were doing was making an act of love to God because we were against this adversity so we were acting on love we said god we love you and we'll come to church anyway even if our baby thighs in her bed while we're at church we're gonna come we were just making a determination in ourselves to do that well that night we went home went to bed daddy didn't go to sleep come on i can't sleep on our babies in the hospital sick dying but I fell asleep for about an hour and Gavin woke me up and said your phones ringing so I got to mention my phone you know how hard it is to wake up at you're going to sleep for one hour I got a bad answer my phone it was the doctor they said your baby is not doing any good she's not responding to our treatment we can't do anything only four we're going to send her to a Kirsten so we need your consent you need to come in and sign his paper so we came in there signed the paper we got it home to come babysit our other three girls like the hospital in Haynesville signed the paper watch them put her delicately in this little box this little plastic kind of incubator to transfer her down to Atlanta and we went down ahead of her on the way down I didn't know this until recently the paramedic told Gaby didn't tell me for some reason and Gabby never thought to tell me until recently she had actually almost lost I would twice on the way now she because she was on an oscillating respirator which is machine that that makes her chest you like this she doesn't inhale and exhale I her lungs would stay inflated constantly and just barely move like that like that air compressor which doesn't look human it looks like a science project gone bad it looks disgusting I was terrible to see your baby in that condition but they didn't have that in ambulance so she was having the pump a hand for an hour ride as fast as she could trying to keep out his lungs inflated and there they lost her twice and then only when we got down there we met dr. Karpen which is a very renowned baby doctor all throughout the southeast she set us down in this in consultation room and looked me in the eye and said your baby is time and that's the first time we've been told that this was very much like Satan as a roaring lion roaring right in my face with all this fear that gripped me like I've never seen before and I stood there like you doing somebody's yelling at you and you're facing stand there just kind of take it with them the you know hug and Gabby was breaking down crying I'm just trying to be strong for her and that she did this she was simply the one is not a devil that one was a good doctor you know and doing the best she perhaps the best to save her baby and I respect her but what she was telling us was terrible news and it was Satan roaring in our face telling us a lot I want to take your baby tonight three hours later pulling me back up so that she told us about this procedure we're going to have to do in your baby which is called ECMO where we put this tube down her jugular vein to draw the blood out circulated through a machine put oxygen in it and put it back in her body that would save her body long enough for her lungs to Hill because she's not getting honest I her lungs were not absorbing the oxygen they were inflating they were when he call it respirating but they weren't taking in oxygen so she's fixed hind brain damage vital organs were fixing to shut down before her lungs even got a chance to heal so they said we're going to do this procedure if she needs it her oxygen saturation was thirty-nine percent before she left Gainesville Tom got down to Atlanta and on the way down and telling how long it was they never told us the thirty-nine percent which is a dolt with died on that I'm pretty sure a baby can small baby can live for a while like that but thirty-nine percent is very borderline brain damage all right because no Washington and other organs would start shutting down so we go there sit beside her for a few hours on no sleep time to read my Bible was praying together in town system then watch them work on our baby and she's lifeless as can be and all the while were dozing off and just trying to fighting sleep were emotionally drained and spiritually drained physically drained and I say to god about six o'clock in the morning it's time to get up go back to gainesville and let's go to church and that's that was the hardest time of my life i'm sure it's even harder than saturday night because this time were actually told she's dying and the procedure itself in that ECMO she's likely to die just in the procedure because they're cutting her jugular vein open and putting it to them they have to put her in surgery and in the surgery during that procedure that could kill her home so in the midst of all that i said well we're going to go church what's just an act of love to god we love God and complete here and we're saying you know Satan this group come against us with all this adversity how much more should we stand and serve God in the midst of that so he stood we went up against mill cutter other kids ready went to church that morning brother william ward of on crease and i testified that august well she's fine everything's gonna be fine that was just a positive confession but because hard time there at that time she was probably already dead I didn't know but left the hospital and on the way back down to Atlanta it was just one service that day we called him and said I wanted to say a she life but instead of just says your neck know yet and they said no she's actually getting better that's what she began to recover and all the rest of time for the next 30 days that she was in the hospital she was became they're getting better but what we did in the missus that was two acts of love that we committed toward God you know and I don't want to say I mean I want to confess that was perfect love but I'm not going to you know folks and say we have all you know understand we are committing an act of love to go all right and that's kind of probably long and hot saying all this for bragging just showing an exemplar all our money guy was Mary's our marriage what we did before we got married we sat down and we decided we want a marriage based on you know a triangle or three fold cord where God is involved in the mayor's it's not just me and Gabi one God involved in putting garlic to be the centerpiece of our marriage meaning that we seek God together we read our Bible pretty good well in the midst of that say we actually got married this was kind of weird to most people but we got married saturday Saturday night you know what happened Sunday morning we were in church okay which is awkward because everybody knew you know wedding night hello and then where we were sitting interest I was high you shouldn't be here you know it was kind of awkward but the pastor turned us out with a loser he said he said boy and expect to see my god but god bless shows good you'll be here embassies everywhere again well I worse but we hope I mean we we you know we got married yesterday we still got down the road from the Turkish to go to church but for some reason this is typical for people to get married and run off into the sunset for week and whatever but we want to be in charge to the want to serve God alright and then every time we've had a baby the very following service most of the time we're in church with a three day old baby which is where the most people you set out for a few which is understandable because you don't the better to say but we just said God we want to come to my what and then and then I looked at my night shift work situation kick me out and work on Wednesday nights I thought if I can be here when my baby's dying I should not let work keep me out of church anymore I never wanted that in the first place just my boss offered it to me and I didn't foresee that I miss half the ones the nights of the year twenty six or so when's the nights of the year so I phone had enough of that I said go on a walk on night shift so i can big church on wednesday nights and he worked it out and by God's grace we've been here everyone tonight sent again another act of love now here's what I'm getting to so what when you show God your love but there's lots of reasons to be at church besides hearing the word and the fellowship and and just being in that atmosphere there's lots of reasons a bigger but he's not forsaking the assembling ourselves together and so much more did you see the Day approaching he didn't say why we think it's because to hear the word but there are lots of other reasons for that but primarily it's obedience you're just acting out of love and acting in obedience to God now Monica sister Monica right around the time that Iowa was in the hospital right after that of trial I think it was when Monica's mom died and I asked her we're praying for everybody was praying for it and I said since ramón files from I'm doing with a branch what she said she smiled she said she couldn't find gonna be okay gonna give her you know every time I asked her shed a father confession I was shocked to hear the monkeys mom died despite that and you know what right after her mom died she came to church on it became the church not only that but she kept teaching those little kitties about Jesus and you know what was in her mind that Satan tempted her and said I didn't talk to you about this but I know I know what Satan is I nothing would have tempted her and said you're gonna tell those little kitties about Jesus and he took your mom you know that's just the way that works and she said yeah I'm sure she said yeah I'm going to anyway so she she commits an act of love toward God by continuing to come to church to spot the leaving up to the very end of her mom died she said God won't keep coming anyway I'm gonna keep serving anyone keep teaching these kids about you anyway so to Rebecca Atkins I hope she bigger this morning psychic microphase graduate Delta her tablish good man okay tell me what can you tell ya um you know her husband got her husband of 18 years passed away I'm going to be a floor in it back and she came the very next service that means they're not you know he had passed away friday we had the funeral sunday wins and I shoes in church I said back there that Wednesday and looking to buy bread and just to accomplish that sister no I'm sitting there just nearly in tears I meant she'd be there I mean I had a feeling that I know what she is and I knew she'd be faithful and be here even if her husband died no one talked to her that night I said I really admire your faith and such harmonica to you about hers with her mom because they committed these acts of love toward God even though their loved ones had done now ours didn't dive our baby was dying but when we came to church anyway but their loved ones actually I her husband died and she came to church all right an act of love to thought faithfulness now um and then who else was there was another example I think I had to do but what I want you to see in all this is I did not get jealous over sister Rebecca committing that act of blood that eyewitness poor dog that act of faith oh there's another one more example quick so then brother branham had prayed I think for a baby and he told him this this and one of his sermons he talked about a couple whose baby had actually died like ours was dying but this was coming this wouldn't baby died and they were in church the next service the thing in point of the mountain said you know something about that's faith he pointed them said that's faith I said well how is that faith because it's an act of love and love produces faith right so they came to church after the baby died you know they didn't stay at home in morn for three days they came right back to church baby just died and brother branham I think and pray for the baby the gods will is sovereign so he took the baby anyway he had a reasoning that but the people came to church anyway and he said that's faith and I thought of Monica and Rebecca and our situations where with all these times we should have been in church but became anyway showing God our love we're just simply making looks the Lord by saying I love him I'm gonna be here alright so here if I thought there was no jealousy in any of that because Rebecca committed that same act that we had done and I admired it and I wasn't enthused about it because someone else is showing love to my god and I want him to receive all the love he came from anywhere say she was doing that in mind was Joseph Joseph Monica they had gone even beyond us because like I said their loved ones had died and they came anyway ours didn't even God and so that I didn't get jealous of them and actually I was induced about it and loved to see that and I want to encourage them and tell anybody so my point is in perfect love there is no jealousy and perfect love there's no malice there's no strife there's no any imperfections perfect look is absolutely pure form hijos names and then I thought about sister brown you know a brother been his first wife died sister hope and brother Brennan would be on the curtain of time now he had remarried and he had married sister me who would build front of time saw his first wife and hoped her came back told me about you thanked me to be jealous and she probably was because she's skilled in this realm of Philip we don't understand we don't put never experienced this great extent of agave love as it is feeling kind of time we had experienced it in its fullest yet but she should have been jealous you would think oh brother BAM and I'm sure she crossed the bank said well you know what else did y'all do talk yes or something you know that's there's no perversion nobody's married there nobody's given in marriage and we can't comprehend it with it I didn't take the whole class to do this but we didn't understand we can't understand this it doesn't really what can't wrap our minds around it it's beyond us so but she wasn't jealous and um Oh hoping there and let's let's go and read a quote about that okay so this is from mostly supposedly from the rejected King I look this way in that way and they were coming by the thousands and I said I don't understand this this is why they and Here Come hope that was my first wife she run and never said my husband she said my precious brother and when she helped me there was another woman standing there they told me say how you would think now hope is gonna stand back she's gonna build uh huh you know hopes me first was and this element moment is hugging brother branham but and I thought oh this has to be something different oh no she's not stupid there was another moment stand there homie and then hope hug this woman so she didn't turn it in slapper she should have slapped her if we were in this room that's what would what should have happened but in that round an imperfect look instead she went over to have another sister you can just hugged her husband you know and I thought oh this has to be something different it can't be there's something I thought oh but I ever want to go back that'll parsing around there and I thought what is this I looked real good i said i can't understand it but hope seemed to be like an old guest of honor she has no different or she was not different but just a guest of honor but i know there i believe will have a relationship like will know that we were husband and wife here man gabby but there won't be any this hugging and kissing type stuff that we do here now on the attributes of failure low be there vivid a love is a condescended part of God God when he condescended I believe his attributes condescended with him love was one of those agave descended to philly oh where we could receive it and understand it in a minor form but it's only opposite end of the spectrum from agape love it's so alpha love is so far beyond video love at best you could say a little love is just like a maybe a shadow or type of it and something just to give us a little bit of understanding about it is only going to make you understand by with me and then I heard a voice in and spoke man was in the room said this was this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I'm more determined than ever my life that it's like the perfect love to enter here there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never in their mortality can never make you old and they could not pry it was just one joy oh my precious brother okay so i guess i'm going to take the rest of the plastic explain this one a little part took about 20 minutes to tell gabby the other day so i'm going to try to put it into five minutes so then the prereq for prerequisites for living in this realm this dimension or what a terrestrial body and a spirit and a soul you pretty well have to have all three of those right if not you're dead you don't have those three body spirit and soul to live in this realm or what are the and I just started thing on this have another study about it a whole lot yet but what are the prerequisites for that now perfect love maybe I guess you'd say celestial body with the elf anybody you have to have somebody to move around but you had to have perfect love to enter their face right why because God is operating on faith this holding power around his whole entire premise is based on faith and you can't enter that room without it think about God before the foundation world when he was ill him and he condescended to logos which speech was born language was born so we could have some part to understand God without that that they just is great big invisible God that nobody could even comprehend and out of that Canyon low cost and he said let there be my brother Brennan said and I don't know if he ever talk about the big thing but I believe in the Big Bang to the extent of what brother Brennan said where he said it seemed like there was nothing it wasn't in his face it wasn't even time it wasn't a matter energy or anything goes nothing and then brother Brennan said an atom burst when God said let there be an atom burst and all of matter time energy space everything came into existence that one creative act in a begin to expand into this universe that we know today what was that not spoken he believed that he mixes onward with faith and the two mixed together is a powerful recipe that makes the universe see the faith of man is in a measure God gives every man a measure of faith but God God's path is measureless so he can create a universe man's faith can move a mountain we were treated and said you can say to the Streamy they looked up Custis II didn't be done moved to the mountain in that faith is grainy mustard seed you must receive as small and what makes you think thing so with that little measure of faith that we have with the move mountains but the faith of God can create a universe that declares himself so that faith his whole entire attributions hold everything is based on faith and when we go to heaven we have to faith to enter we have to have faith to remain there so think about this this is sort of a philosophical question but if you were in heaven if something I could get in heaven with no faith and you were there in heaven with no faith would you even know you were there you know what I mean because everything your contact is by faith everything you would see there will be my faith everything you touch will be but my faith everything that you experience with it by faith so you wouldn't even know you were there couldn't have faith in Jesus in Matthew 22 was talking about the wedding Garth the man that got in without the way Garth why they didn't cast him out in outer darkness because he had no Carmen the Holy Ghost no faith so then you can't operate in that room you came to go into that room without faith so God during this whole entire time we're here on earth is trying to get us to play that's the most basic element of Christianity is always believed Christ APC right only believe simply believe all things are possible with them to believe you just said over and over again fear not only believe right he said believe believe believe so if we just simply believe the whole entire thing see God doesn't appear to us in a fleshly form could be easier to believe them but he said blessed are they that believe and have not seen so if you hadn't have seen the form of God appeared to you which most of us have it the boss is no medicine got any time in this carnal mind I guess there's no way for us to see God you know but we have to see him by eyes of faith he wants us to believe so that we can even go there the whole I mean the whole entire thing about Christianity is just based upon believing I'm brother Bill concretion a lot about believing God highs and simplicity he doesn't manifest himself openings not a show off you know in the whole entire creation of the universe they've studied and seen in telescopes I don't know if y'all know this but the whole space telescope can actually see down through time because space is so the expansive space is so broad that they can actually sit back with the host table space coast up to the Big Bang almost to the Big Bang becuase there same space is expanding and it expanded faster than light light travels at you know six million miles six trillion miles a year 186,000 miles per second but the matter in space and time expended faster than that so it's beyond it so then now here we are in planet earth and we can look back from the Hubble Space Telescope they can look so far down through space actually can actually see the early existence of the universe as galaxies were beginning to form you know they can actually see that early time in the universe and all that time that the faith was a she not even lost talk now oh yeah because they can see in other words they can see that the you know evolving of the universe into these different little galaxies and solar systems is God was forming things together but they didn't see the hand of God putting this they're putting out there they didn't see God forming the Sun they didn't see any of God because he's do it in his simplicity when you see things in nature you see you can watch them through a microscope a conception of a baby you can see these little germs floating around this egg and all of a sudden one of them seemingly on its own accord just goes into the egg well what is that God is behind that moving that there but you cannot see him God is going to show off and he can't be seen and all the natural things we just can't look around their natural eyes I'm seeing you have to believe in my faith so then God highs in simplicity he reveals itself in simplicity it's impossible to see go about faith and hospital please God without faith bob says so that's pretty much for all this and I thought up the whole time to do that if you get to the bit to the come let us reason No
