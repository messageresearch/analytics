[9:21] hours different so it's already Sunday
[9:23] evening in the Philippines and uh they
[9:26] have just finished their wonderful
[9:27] service and they want to extend also
[9:30] their greetings to you as uh they know
[9:32] that I'll be preaching this morning in
[9:34] in in in this church so I have I have
[9:37] you seated for a while and uh just
[9:41] to send a little bit of uh the report
[9:45] that uh what transpired in the
[9:48] Philippines uh first of all I would like
[9:50] to thank our pastor here by Samuel Dale
[9:53] for having me over here and uh sister
[9:55] Peggy uh for having me in their home
[9:59] this my second time to to stay in their
[10:01] in their place and uh I am thankful for
[10:03] the hospitality and uh the kindness that
[10:06] they have shown and also the whole
[10:08] family of brother Samuel and um you know
[10:12] brother Danny delmundo he's one of the
[10:14] pastor in the Philippines and last I
[10:16] believe it was last year that he was
[10:17] here and uh he he mentioned to us how
[10:20] good the fellowship went uh when he was
[10:23] here and then he went home he said that
[10:25] uh uh we were having better way uh
[10:30] to go to the Philippines so uh we're
[10:32] looking forward to that time uh and uh
[10:35] you you know many many brothers have met
[10:38] brother samale when he was there in the
[10:39] Philippines last
[10:41] 2005 and uh before just before I I uh I
[10:45] give the report on this relief efforts I
[10:47] just just like to mention that uh this
[10:49] is not the first time that uh uh this
[10:52] church or B samale extended the the
[10:55] assistance because way back in 2004
[10:57] there was a typhoon also not
[10:59] uh as as strong as this one but uh I was
[11:02] working with Bible Believers uh office
[11:05] during that time and U um this typhoon
[11:09] came and there's one church with 10
[11:11] families that were it's upper north of
[11:13] the Philippines and uh there were you
[11:15] know big boulders and trees just fell
[11:17] off and uh just buried all the the the
[11:21] houses including the Church of uh of our
[11:23] Brethren there and uh when we went there
[11:26] I was with brother Ernie we we tried to
[11:28] help them there are other uh Believers
[11:31] from other countries who help also in
[11:33] rebuilding the the houses of the people
[11:35] here and just is what about just about
[11:37] the time that we started this relief
[11:39] efforts and the next year brother Samuel
[11:42] came with brother Ernie and brother Tim
[11:44] Calhoun and uh we went there to that
[11:47] place actually and uh it was already uh
[11:49] I mean that was already months after the
[11:51] typhoon but uh you know brother Samuel
[11:54] had the the the burden to to help to
[11:56] further help the people there 10 houses
[11:59] were already built but uh uh there were
[12:01] no church building during that time and
[12:03] uh they they helped in the church
[12:05] building and you know buying these
[12:07] chairs and everything and uh since then
[12:09] that was 2005 uh I mean the the services
[12:13] there the the the people or the
[12:16] Believers they they continue to serve
[12:18] the Lord amen and uh the pastor in that
[12:22] church four years later uh he actually
[12:25] he had a terminal illness and just 3
[12:28] days after it was diagnosed he just know
[12:31] expired and just left the scene with uh
[12:34] eight small children and you know the
[12:36] Widow of course and uh you know brother
[12:39] Samuel being there and he KN he knew uh
[12:42] I he learned of what happened and he
[12:43] started uh uh sending support for the
[12:47] Widow and the uh you know the children
[12:50] and uh that's what the Bible says that
[12:52] uh we should take care of the widows and
[12:54] the fatherless and that has been ongoing
[12:57] from 2009 until this time
[12:59] and I bring to you also the the the the
[13:02] deepest gratitude of sister prey that's
[13:05] the name of the Widow uh and he he just
[13:09] she just cannot speak or write in in
[13:11] English but uh she when she knew about
[13:13] that I I'll be coming over she said to
[13:16] express their greetings and then now
[13:18] some of the children are all now grown
[13:20] up his eldest I I used to work with IBM
[13:24] uh in the Philippines and so we took the
[13:26] eldest son of the the the pastor and I
[13:29] just gave him a job so he can just after
[13:31] he finished high school we we help them
[13:34] also because most of the local Believers
[13:36] where I where I'm staying in Manila it's
[13:38] the capital city uh we we have we we we
[13:41] try to help the the brothers and sisters
[13:43] up in the mountains uh you know that how
[13:46] how they live there and uh it's very
[13:48] different in what how we live in the
[13:50] city and so myself brother Danny and
[13:52] brother Nessa we just kind of go around
[13:55] once in a while just to check on them
[13:57] and help them and uh having having
[14:00] traveled in other countries we we we can
[14:03] uh I mean brother Nesta and brother
[14:05] Danny has been traveling all over Asia
[14:07] and traveling also in the US and once we
[14:10] get this help we we try to make it a
[14:12] point that uh it reaches the people the
[14:15] the churches there and those who who do
[14:17] not have any contacts those who who
[14:19] cannot even speak in English so uh but
[14:22] they need a lot of uh you know support
[14:24] moral support know prayers and uh I can
[14:27] assure you that this uh that that the
[14:30] monthly um Mission uh love offering that
[14:34] uh is being sent uh to us is being
[14:37] distributed to this ministers and
[14:40] there's one testimony of One Pastor
[14:42] there uh he is is much younger than me
[14:45] and uh he is a pastor but did they go
[14:47] normally and walk about 7 days to go up
[14:50] the mountains because there are natives
[14:52] there that they want to share the
[14:53] message too and just recently uh just
[14:57] before the typhoon they they just came
[14:58] there 7 Days walking uh with in
[15:01] mountains that doesn't have any Trail on
[15:04] it and uh and uh they were able to
[15:07] baptize more than 10 Souls amen amen
[15:09] yeah Hallelujah and you know uh every
[15:12] every time every time that uh this
[15:15] things happen and we know that uh it's
[15:17] not just their efforts but your prayers
[15:20] here and the support that you give it it
[15:21] could have have not been possible for
[15:23] them because as the Bible says uh how
[15:25] can they call on God if they have not
[15:27] heard how can they you know if they did
[15:29] not how can they uh um if they don't
[15:32] believe and there's no preacher so we
[15:34] have to send the preachers and even I
[15:37] I'm from the Philippines I cannot do
[15:38] what they're doing just basically
[15:41] because they are younger than me they're
[15:43] stronger and they and they they know the
[15:45] the terrain of the mountains which I I I
[15:47] I didn't grow up in those mountains so
[15:50] uh but there are souls precious souls in
[15:52] those mountains and we are in the
[15:54] business of looking for the last
[15:56] predestinated seed and who knows they
[15:58] they they might be laying there uh in
[16:00] those mountains and so we're just
[16:03] thankful that um when when the brother
[16:05] just reported it in the last Minister's
[16:07] meeting that we had and I can feel that
[16:09] you know we are all part of uh all this
[16:12] uh Endeavors that uh God has given in
[16:14] our hands uh we we may not do be doing
[16:17] the same thing but uh I believe we're
[16:19] working as a team yes it's it's a one
[16:21] big team that we are working in and it's
[16:23] all for the glory of God we're not
[16:25] building any Kingdom we're not we're not
[16:27] building any group or whatsoever but we
[16:29] just want to look for the last
[16:30] predestinated seed and and so this
[16:34] happened the the the typhoon last uh
[16:38] November uh as I mentioned to the
[16:41] brothers uh they we have we are
[16:44] frequented by 10 by 20 typhoons at least
[16:47] in one year and in some cases it goes to
[16:50] 25 typhoons some are strong some are
[16:52] just mild some are just you know small
[16:55] but uh sometimes it it it it uh it
[16:57] creates flooding
[16:59] sometimes it damages the houses so for
[17:01] for the last four years there's always
[17:03] strong typhoon nearly the end of the
[17:05] month by this month of December and uh
[17:08] there will be houses a certain area in
[17:11] the Philippines particularly the
[17:12] southern area that uh you know there
[17:15] there's lots of flooding maybe I don't
[17:17] know this this doesn't used to happen
[17:19] when I was young but uh maybe because of
[17:21] the climate change and everything uh
[17:24] things has has become worse right and so
[17:27] um we were told that this super typhoon
[17:29] was coming it was coming and uh of
[17:35] course people were preparing the
[17:36] government Was preparing but this is
[17:38] something that has not happened in the
[17:40] past many years and so people were not
[17:43] really complacent but uh they tried to
[17:45] prepare and uh just to to put everything
[17:49] in order but when it came everybody was
[17:52] surprised it was like uh strong winds
[17:55] just sweeping every houses on its path
[17:58] and just
[17:59] you can you will see later on the
[18:00] pictures even the big ships they were
[18:02] pushed to land and uh uh this uh waves
[18:07] from the ocean like 30 ft High just came
[18:10] rushing it's like a tsunami there was no
[18:13] earthquake but uh the the the the winds
[18:15] were so strong and uh just before this
[18:19] typhoon happened there was this there
[18:21] was a strong uh I think 7.5 magnitude in
[18:24] the same area so people were just uh
[18:27] slowly recovering right and uh then this
[18:31] typhoon came so you can just imagine how
[18:34] uh the the extent of the damage that uh
[18:37] that came to the Philippines during that
[18:39] time and so I would like to to share to
[18:42] you some of the the things pictures and
[18:45] the some of the testimonies that goes to
[18:47] the picture and uh uh we will see here
[18:49] in the slides uh how how we approach the
[18:52] the this the problem because um in uh uh
[18:58] when when this happened I was working
[19:00] with brother Nestor another Pastor there
[19:02] brother Danny they just came from from a
[19:05] uh from uh from a trip in some Asian
[19:09] countries and uh when this happened and
[19:11] they they also learned about this so we
[19:14] we kind of group together just to to
[19:16] make sure that the efforts will be done
[19:19] systematically and uh sometimes you know
[19:21] you learn something from where you were
[19:23] working before and I was working in the
[19:26] in with with IBM Philippines during the
[19:28] time and uh one of my responsibility is
[19:31] to to uh is uh to you know conduct this
[19:35] uh disaster recovery program uh we call
[19:38] it risk management so we we we we we
[19:42] studi the risks that uh that may impact
[19:44] the business and uh uh do some things
[19:47] and and and and and uh in case of a
[19:50] disaster we the the the objective is to
[19:54] have a business continuity program we
[19:57] don't stop after the disaster but we
[19:59] want to recover and so learning from
[20:01] these things as uh the the prophet said
[20:03] we can we can learn from our former
[20:06] secular job and you can apply it you
[20:07] know and so uh we we group together and
[20:10] we divided the the what you call this
[20:13] the response in in three phases uh can
[20:16] we have the slide
[20:20] please this would explain how we did it
[20:22] just to make sure that uh everything was
[20:25] done in proper and we we we want we want
[20:28] to to
[20:32] cover oh
[20:35] I
[20:36] okay I can excuse me I'll I'll just get
[20:40] the stick and I thought it was
[20:42] transferred
[21:19] okay so uh what we did is divided it
[21:22] into three phases we call it the first
[21:25] phase was the initial phase the second
[21:27] phase would be the
[21:29] the Reconstruction of the houses by the
[21:31] way we lost around the uh I mean we 258
[21:35] houses were destroyed in this typhoon
[21:37] these are for the Believers only and uh
[21:40] there are 22 churches that were
[21:42] destroyed also so that means to more
[21:44] than 200 families were affected and uh
[21:47] this is uh I would like to show first uh
[21:49] in the next slide here this is the T
[21:51] typhoon F here and if you can see it hit
[21:55] the middle of uh the Philippine is
[21:58] islands and uh in the next slide please
[22:01] uh we'll show we had colorcoded the the
[22:05] areas that were affected the red ones
[22:06] are the most affected the yellow or
[22:09] yellow orange are the ones that are uh
[22:12] also affected but not as bad as the the
[22:15] red ones I'm staying uh somewhere here
[22:18] we felt the winds there but there was no
[22:21] damage and this is the southern part
[22:23] there was no damage also but as we can
[22:25] see uh uh it went from there and it
[22:28] passed through here only maybe the whole
[22:31] day of Saturday but it it left big
[22:34] Devastation in the country so the next
[22:37] uh slide please uh we just it was this
[22:40] just a focus of uh we can see we have
[22:42] capies Iloilo antika in this island
[22:45] that's late that's the most uh that's
[22:48] where many people died and according
[22:50] according to some of the the the news
[22:53] it's it it's close to 10,000 some say
[22:56] it's over 10,000 people who died and uh
[22:59] it's it just swept everything on its
[23:01] path you know uh when it passed through
[23:04] those islands and uh because this island
[23:07] normally uh uh during during typhoon we
[23:10] have this uh strong waves coming from
[23:13] both parts the China Sea in the Pacific
[23:15] Ocean okay so the next slide please so
[23:18] these are some pictures as we can see
[23:20] here that uh these are the ship uh that
[23:23] was brought to the shore and everything
[23:26] was devastated along its way next
[23:28] picture please uh this a top view
[23:31] actually of before the the typhoon and
[23:35] after the typhoon it was total desolate
[23:38] so there was no houses people were
[23:40] washed away to the
[23:42] ocean I mean no there was no person uh
[23:45] left here because the uh the the the
[23:48] storm surge just came and left it
[23:51] brought every person living here okay so
[23:54] until this time they're still digging
[23:58] when when they go to the wreckage
[23:59] according to the pastor that was there
[24:01] before I left he said uh there are still
[24:03] you know bodies you know this already
[24:06] corrupted bodies that's still being
[24:07] recovered up to up to two weeks ago okay
[24:11] the next picture please so this a
[24:13] closeup of the desolated area you we you
[24:16] you cannot see even see a single body
[24:18] you know uh everything was
[24:20] destroyed um people uh whether all their
[24:25] animals their pets and everything was
[24:27] washed away by the the the ocean the
[24:30] there's the rain was was uh there was no
[24:33] heavy downpour of rain the water came
[24:36] from the ocean the next slide please so
[24:40] now we're going here in the this is a
[24:42] poultry house that is being care uh
[24:45] taken care of by a brother he used to
[24:47] have uh 10,000 chickens something like
[24:49] that uh he's taken care of but after the
[24:51] flood it was all destroyed so um only 11
[24:55] chickens were left that's the source of
[24:58] of uh his livelihood and uh he doesn't
[25:01] own the poultry is is just he was is
[25:03] just hired to to to to take care of it
[25:06] and after that the owner said I will
[25:08] stop this business and then he doesn't
[25:11] have to he he doesn't have any source of
[25:13] living anymore and for the next let's
[25:16] say five days after the typhoon they
[25:17] were eating the dead chicken there
[25:19] because there's there was nothing to it
[25:21] they cannot buy anything and the
[25:22] mountains everything fell so this is
[25:25] another picture the next slide please
[25:28] uh this is the H one house of the
[25:31] believer nothing was left this uh on the
[25:34] side of the mountains so their houses
[25:36] are mainly made of bamboo sticks and the
[25:39] NEPA hats and uh um that was what was
[25:43] left in their house the second the next
[25:45] picture please uh this is a house that
[25:48] uh this used to be a house you know but
[25:50] uh the the roof fell off and so there I
[25:54] I I was here I I was here in that in
[25:57] that instance I went there there and the
[25:59] people I mean the the the brother and
[26:02] the sister they have three children
[26:04] small children and um they have to sleep
[26:07] there and you know after the the typhoon
[26:09] it was it was very hot you know how the
[26:12] the humidity in in the Philippines and
[26:14] uh and so they they were staying there
[26:17] and you know if the Sun hits the this
[26:19] roof it's it's it's very hot you know
[26:22] and if night time it rains and and it it
[26:25] the winds blow and uh and uh this not a
[26:29] a very safe place because you know when
[26:32] when the the houses were destroyed also
[26:34] the the place where the snakes are
[26:36] staying they were also yeah and uh what
[26:40] happened is uh these snakes they crawl
[26:43] under here on night time and so the
[26:47] Father the our brother there he he he
[26:49] has to have this they call it we call it
[26:51] the jungle B just to make sure that uh
[26:56] he kept he he keeps his children very
[26:58] very safe and not only that because
[27:01] after the typhoon they were looting all
[27:03] around so if they know that you have
[27:05] some food in your house they will try to
[27:07] go there and you have to defend your
[27:09] family you you cannot do anything you
[27:11] you because every it's it's
[27:14] chaos it's Revival of the fittest you
[27:17] know you they have to look for water
[27:19] they have to look for food and so when
[27:21] we went there they don't don't have any
[27:22] clean water we have to to to get some
[27:25] water over in that area and uh it's not
[27:28] really a clean water because the
[27:30] fountain there's some frogs and you know
[27:32] mosquitoes and everything but uh they
[27:35] they stayed there for about a few weeks
[27:37] because we don't have even materials you
[27:40] know right there were lack of materials
[27:42] to to to rebuild immediately these
[27:45] houses the next picture please so in
[27:48] another house of a brother only this
[27:50] dining table was left with the some
[27:52] plates and Spoon and the rest of the
[27:54] house the it was just blown away by the
[27:56] wind m and uh uh again the the the the
[28:01] brothers they have no place to stay in
[28:03] so if you can see this table during
[28:06] night time they have to sleep under the
[28:08] table they have to sleep they the owner
[28:10] of this place have at least four
[28:12] children and the parents and you can
[28:15] just imagine how can they can they stay
[28:17] under the table just to keep them you
[28:19] know safe and uh a little a little bit
[28:22] comfortable and yeah and they have their
[28:25] them the the Ducks there you can sew the
[28:26] Ducks and the chicken there and those
[28:29] the next picture please uh oh so so this
[28:33] what we have done as we I said this the
[28:35] initial response we sent financial
[28:38] assistance but at that point in time it
[28:40] was not actually practical because uh
[28:44] they they they there's no use for the
[28:46] money you cannot buy anything there's no
[28:49] stores all everything was destroyed so
[28:51] even you have ,000 in your hand you
[28:53] cannot buy anything this is an example
[28:56] that you know when this time comes when
[28:58] money has no value at all of course we
[29:01] we were able to use the financial
[29:02] assistance maybe a week later then we we
[29:06] have to there should have to be the
[29:08] distribution of food and water there are
[29:10] local Pastors in that in that area that
[29:12] we were able to to contact and uh they
[29:15] were the ones going to the to the remote
[29:17] places that we cannot even go there
[29:19] because uh there was no airport
[29:21] available Transportation was not
[29:23] available and we are far from them and
[29:26] um they had to have medical assist
[29:28] distance because you know people the
[29:30] especially the children they're you know
[29:32] cough and colds because of the extreme
[29:34] WEA extreme change of the weather very
[29:36] hot in the morning very cold in the
[29:38] evening no clothes to wear and some um
[29:41] you know there they need some anti-
[29:43] tetanos uh vaccine because of what's
[29:46] Happening you know and mosquito bites
[29:49] and uh because of that we decided to
[29:52] evacuate the brothers and sisters
[29:54] because it's not a livable place anymore
[29:56] that's in late so some of the people
[29:58] they they just want to stay because
[30:00] they're they're using the mountains they
[30:01] don't want to go down but some of the
[30:04] people living in in the city they we we
[30:06] try to tell them there's no way that you
[30:08] can live here for the next maybe 7 days
[30:10] or two weeks so we have to evacuate them
[30:13] we have to rent cars I mean U uh not
[30:16] cars but U uh you know big uh this this
[30:18] U like gyes that we have in the
[30:21] Philippines to to to bring them into a
[30:23] safer location where there's a h uh you
[30:26] know good house but there was no
[30:28] electricity over all the islands so no
[30:31] electricity and uh food was was so
[30:34] scarce and water was you know uh you
[30:37] when you go there there's Panic buying
[30:39] everywhere and there was looting
[30:40] happening all around so for example I am
[30:43] I am one of the looters and I bring it
[30:45] home then the another looter will go to
[30:47] my home to loot my own home and so you
[30:51] have to fight everybody and when we go
[30:53] there this the dangerous thing because
[30:54] when we go there and they they know that
[30:56] we are not from that place right then we
[30:59] they sometimes they would stop you they
[31:01] they would they would see what you have
[31:03] if you have food or you water you have
[31:05] money they would like to it's not
[31:06] actually rubbing but you know as I said
[31:08] it is already survival see so uh we had
[31:13] uh need there there was a need to rent
[31:15] some houses for the families who were
[31:17] evacuated and we have to mobilize um
[31:20] different teams doing the relief efforts
[31:21] we cannot do everything so we have to
[31:23] ask the brothers and the sisters who
[31:25] volunteered their help to to do those
[31:27] things going back and forth to the
[31:29] affected areas and uh even the brothers
[31:31] and I mean even the volunteers after a
[31:33] few weeks or a few days of doing this
[31:35] they got sick themselves because you'll
[31:37] be walking on the streets with all the
[31:40] dead
[31:41] bodies see there no nobody can pick up
[31:44] the dead body because even C bugs are
[31:47] out of out of stock and they they're
[31:50] just there with all the Flies and
[31:52] everything and there's no food and uh
[31:55] you know some little children not
[31:57] children of the Believers they will if
[31:59] uh they find maybe a fallen banana from
[32:02] a a banana from the Fallen trees just
[32:04] laying beside the the the dead bodies
[32:07] they have to get it and eat it you know
[32:10] because they need to survive they need
[32:12] to survive and so you can I mean the the
[32:16] the the smell of the dead bodies of of
[32:18] people the dead bodies of the dogs the
[32:21] goats all together so it was not a
[32:24] healthy place to go to right just to
[32:26] breathe the air there's not health at
[32:28] all see so but but I mean the the the
[32:32] group of Believers the volunteers that
[32:34] are there I mean because of the love and
[32:36] their concern for their brothers they
[32:37] they had to do it they had to do it and
[32:39] we were contacting them and the moment
[32:41] that we were able to to to board the
[32:43] plane we flew to to to some of these
[32:45] areas in the so that was for the initial
[32:49] response for the second phase in the
[32:51] next slide please uh we had the
[32:54] rebuilding of the houses and the
[32:55] churches because we want we don't want
[32:57] them to stay you know with no roof with
[32:59] no anything so we started the the
[33:02] purchase and the hauling of construction
[33:04] materials but this was very hard because
[33:06] uh everybody was rebuilding their houses
[33:09] and so you can only if even you have the
[33:11] money you let's say you can only buy a
[33:14] kilo of nails not nothing more than that
[33:17] so it that that is what uh prolonged the
[33:20] the construction uh uh efforts and
[33:24] because there was no uh electricity all
[33:26] over the land and so we had to purchase
[33:28] the generator sets and even change so to
[33:31] to cut their own wood and we gathered
[33:34] volunteers to to help in the
[33:36] construction so brother Nestor and
[33:38] myself and brother Danny we just go back
[33:40] and forth to these areas or sometimes if
[33:42] we cannot fly there we just we just uh
[33:45] uh communicate with them but uh this the
[33:49] brothers in in this areas they have to
[33:50] go to a certain location where there
[33:53] will be uh what do you call this the the
[33:55] signal for the cell phone because every
[33:57] post they they just fell off and uh
[33:59] there was no electricity so there was no
[34:00] battery for the cell phones so there's a
[34:03] single place there that they have to you
[34:05] know to fall in line the whole day just
[34:08] to just to charge your phone for a few
[34:10] minutes and then go to a a certain
[34:13] location where there will be a signal
[34:15] but when they go back to their home
[34:16] there no signal at all so it's it's
[34:18] where so I we we decided that we we need
[34:22] to go to that place we cannot just uh
[34:24] rely on telephone and much more in
[34:26] Internet see so we we we we had to go
[34:30] there and you know we we just we just
[34:32] have to to dress the way the people
[34:34] dress there so they will not suspect us
[34:35] of having you bringing money so I was uh
[34:39] in one of the trips there I was with my
[34:40] Deacon and we have some a cash on on a
[34:43] hand and I told him just let's separate
[34:46] and U put some in your socks put some in
[34:49] your pocket yeah so if anybody goes to
[34:52] to get what we have then we will there's
[34:54] be some some remaining see and of of
[34:57] course the government are doing their
[34:59] part but you know how the government
[35:00] moves it's it's a little bit slow you
[35:02] know okay they they take time you know
[35:05] they take time doing that there's not no
[35:07] that that there's no actual concern and
[35:10] so uh what we did is the repair of the
[35:14] partially damaged houses and churches
[35:15] and the rebuilding of the totally washed
[35:17] out houses and uh of course the they
[35:21] need to to continue their worship to the
[35:23] Lord you know so they have they we we
[35:25] provide for the Bibles and if that
[35:27] happen the the typhoon happened on
[35:28] Wednesday on on Saturday the Sunday they
[35:32] of course now but there were there was
[35:34] no church any anyway so Wednesday they
[35:37] started worshiping the Lord again amen
[35:39] even after this catastrophe they started
[35:41] worshiping the Lord because they're
[35:44] still alive you know I mean they survive
[35:47] amen the next uh phase uh the next phase
[35:49] would be the phase three this is the
[35:52] restoration of the livelihood we we are
[35:53] not uh we we we it is not our objective
[35:57] to you know to make them Rich we our
[36:00] only objective is to give them a head
[36:02] start right just to start with the with
[36:06] anything any source of income that they
[36:08] might have because some of them are
[36:09] farmers some of them are fishermen so uh
[36:12] with with all this with what happened to
[36:14] the land of course if you plant
[36:16] something you have the Harvest will be
[36:18] the next few months and the fishes and I
[36:21] mean the the the ocean I don't think
[36:23] it's still you would not like to to fish
[36:25] in an ocean where there are many dead
[36:27] bodies yeah and so we it will take a
[36:30] little bit of time so if they cannot go
[36:33] back to their former source of
[36:35] livelihood where we're studying if they
[36:37] if they can we we can introduce some new
[36:39] source of livelyhood that will be
[36:40] applicable in their uh specific or
[36:43] respective location okay so the next
[36:46] slide will be show some pictures of what
[36:48] we have already done this is L Province
[36:51] this the most devastated uh place the
[36:54] the capital of this is is called
[36:56] Tacloban uh we have a good good
[36:58] testimony here in the next slide please
[37:01] so this brother Nestor here I work with
[37:03] him brother Danny over there yeah and
[37:05] this the pastor here brother buuy Africa
[37:08] so that was the time that we went there
[37:09] and we were Distributing this uh dialect
[37:11] Bibles for them so uh uh I mean that in
[37:16] at that point in time they they they're
[37:18] slowly recovering already so brother
[37:20] boou Bo Africa is very uh is very
[37:23] thankful for uh for all the for all the
[37:26] help that he that they
[37:28] received the next slide please so this
[37:31] is the the church building of brother
[37:34] Buu Africa the testimony here is that on
[37:36] a Friday night that brother in the
[37:38] middle he called for his congregation
[37:40] around 70 of them and he was calling to
[37:43] let's stay in the let's stay in the
[37:44] church because their houses are not made
[37:47] of concrete only the church is made of
[37:48] concrete so they they they they believe
[37:51] that it will be much safer for them to
[37:53] stay in the H and they they scheduled
[37:56] the prayer meeting on overnight prayer
[37:58] meeting while the super tyen is coming
[38:00] they wanted to to spend their time uh
[38:02] praying and uh during the time the the
[38:05] roof was still intact and uh around 2:
[38:08] in the morning to 3:00 in the morning
[38:10] the the winds the strong winds start
[38:11] howling and you know you can they can
[38:14] hear the shouting of the people outside
[38:16] and the rushing of the strong waves and
[38:19] uh they can see from the window that uh
[38:21] people were running it it was like they
[38:24] they were in the Noah's Ark and everyone
[38:26] everything's happening out outside and
[38:28] so they just kept on praying and praying
[38:30] even the children were were crying until
[38:32] daylight and then the pastor brother bu
[38:34] he went out he found out that uh uh many
[38:38] was devastated I mean around them and uh
[38:42] one of the the people uh the government
[38:45] official that was there they were asking
[38:46] were you not uh uh affected by the The
[38:49] Surge which is around 30 ft high and
[38:52] said we're all
[38:53] intact but the next just the next block
[38:56] I mean the I mean in in the the in the
[38:59] next street there was a hospital there
[39:01] around a three story hospital and and
[39:03] the water the ocean water just reached
[39:05] the second floor killing so many
[39:07] people and it was just if it's if the
[39:09] church is here it's just maybe a
[39:10] building away and what they cannot
[39:13] explain is because they're all in ground
[39:15] the same ground level right but not a
[39:18] single drop of the ocean water touched
[39:20] the house amen and while I mean while
[39:24] the ocean was surging they were praying
[39:26] amen and it's just kind of just you know
[39:29] I don't know how they did it but uh the
[39:31] water just split in half and uh spared
[39:34] the Church of course because of the wind
[39:36] the the the roof has to be removed
[39:38] already it was damaged but everybody the
[39:41] 70 Believers inside they all surviv amen
[39:44] nobody was injured nobody died and uh uh
[39:48] they were rejoicing immediately after
[39:50] they were crying and rejoicing at the
[39:51] same time because when they when they
[39:54] went out the church they saw their
[39:56] houses were already gone
[39:58] but they're still alive and the church
[39:59] was still there praise the Lord amen
[40:02] praise the so it's a powerful testimony
[40:04] there and I mean when when the pastor
[40:06] here was went to to Manila to to report
[40:08] it he was literally crying in tears I
[40:11] mean I mean he he could not believe what
[40:13] had happened but they know that it was
[40:15] the hand of God that protected them in
[40:17] that uh very uh difficult situation the
[40:20] next slide please uh so these are just
[40:23] the houses that uh that's the before and
[40:25] after some some the house that's
[40:27] partially damaged now uh as you can see
[40:30] in the next pictures houses are just the
[40:33] basic the W the the roof the walls we we
[40:36] we are not trying to build some fancy
[40:38] houses because uh we just want to keep
[40:40] them uh in a good shape at least to be
[40:42] safe from the rain and the Sun so that
[40:45] was totally damaged house now they're
[40:46] rebuilding that next picture please so
[40:49] again they they lived intents for a
[40:52] while but uh now the the house these
[40:54] houses at at this point in time are
[40:56] almost finished now amen so the next
[40:59] please so these are one of the finnished
[41:03] houses uh this on the side of the
[41:06] mountains you cannot you cannot bring up
[41:08] the concrete there because it's uh
[41:10] that's the the brother Nester says light
[41:13] material is better than that in in those
[41:16] areas he's he's an engineer by
[41:18] profession so he knows what he he he's
[41:20] the one directing these things this is
[41:23] another this the the the the brother
[41:24] over there is the past the pastor that
[41:26] we contacted is going back and forth
[41:29] about about 3 hours motorcycle ride back
[41:31] and forth because you cannot bring
[41:33] four-wheels and uh he he should stop in
[41:37] a certain point and just walk his way
[41:39] because even the motorcycles cannot pass
[41:41] through the dead bodies and uh I mean 5
[41:44] days going back and forth he got
[41:46] terribly sick because of all you know
[41:48] inhaling all the and everything and uh
[41:51] but he kept on going there until today
[41:54] just to make sure that the houses are
[41:56] built and the we finish everything by
[41:58] the by the end of
[42:00] March the next uh next slide please so
[42:02] this is another house for for this
[42:05] family of Believers here um again light
[42:08] materials the next
[42:10] please another house that was built was
[42:13] finished next picture please there
[42:15] another house that was finished here
[42:17] this is almost the same uh these are in
[42:19] in different places but uh they they
[42:22] they build almost the same
[42:23] materials so that that that Pastor is
[42:25] also a carpenter so he know he he's
[42:28] helping he's helping so as much as as
[42:31] much as all the Believers can help they
[42:33] they do what they can do this in another
[42:35] province in cibu which which was also
[42:38] affected uh next slide please so this
[42:41] old sister she lost most of the walls of
[42:44] the house now in this area it is better
[42:47] according to brother nessar is there in

[44:06] a uh uh I mean he has some relatives
[44:09] also in another country that uh helped
[44:11] him so instead of just building a small
[44:14] one they they put together the funds
[44:16] that they were able to get and they
[44:18] built a more higher ceiling using steel
[44:22] trashes because they're very near the
[44:24] seashore and in case another typhoon
[44:26] come it it will be much stronger than
[44:29] the other the next picture please so
[44:33] here is in capis
[44:35] Province next slide please so this the
[44:38] one that the one with the snakes are
[44:39] under so now the their house being
[44:41] rebuilt but now that's already finished
[44:45] uh next picture please so this another
[44:47] that you can see in the other side that
[44:50] it was totally destroyed so when I went
[44:53] here this how it looks like but now
[44:55] according to the pastor there it's
[44:56] already finished
[44:57] so you see how small their children are
[45:00] that house is partially damaged now it
[45:02] has been repaired and we have put on new
[45:05] walls on the
[45:07] sides second uh so this another family
[45:12] that has uh the one with the dining
[45:14] table Yeah you see a while ago so now
[45:16] they have their own house again back
[45:18] back to normal yeah so now they they
[45:20] don't have to sleep under the the the
[45:24] table okay next please so this another
[45:27] house that was damaged and uh now this
[45:30] house is already finished they have
[45:31] already the walls in
[45:32] it next picture this is the side of the
[45:36] Church of the church in capis it was
[45:39] already standing there before the
[45:41] typhoon but uh it was not uh uh finished
[45:44] there was no waterproofing so when the
[45:47] the winds came and it just uh water
[45:50] damaged uh the inside of the church so
[45:52] now they're trying to put some finishing
[45:54] on it and uh again and uh these are
[45:57] brothers working helping each other to
[45:59] to rebuild it okay next slide
[46:03] please next uh this another province in
[46:06] this brother here in the middle his
[46:09] parents are not Believers and he's
[46:12] always being persecuted by because
[46:15] they're Catholics and they joined he he
[46:17] he went to the message and uh after the
[46:20] tyon their house was totally damaged
[46:23] except for this they just put a
[46:24] makeshift uh just to protect them from
[46:26] the heat of the Sun and uh his father
[46:29] over there was asking help from the
[46:31] Catholic church but uh never never
[46:34] receive know even one peso to help them
[46:37] live by and so when brother Dany uh went
[46:42] there I mean he also sent money I went
[46:44] there and uh this is uh what happened
[46:47] the next slide please so they're
[46:50] starting to build a concrete uh house in
[46:52] the in the place and so the father was
[46:55] wondering because uh at first he was
[46:57] persecuting you know the brothers
[46:58] because they they he feels that his son
[47:01] was stolen from from their faith yeah
[47:03] and now when he saw the love and the
[47:05] concern of the brothers and sisters
[47:07] knowing that the the financing here even
[47:09] came from other countries they you know
[47:11] he had a change of attitude towards the
[47:13] Believers and now he's starting to
[47:15] attend the service amen so it has it has
[47:19] an effect even in the spiritual life the
[47:21] people this and the next picture is
[47:23] another brother in that
[47:25] area his father is not here and uh he
[47:28] his father's always also persecuting him
[47:30] because of you know leaving the church
[47:32] and when when the typhoon happened and
[47:34] their house was totally destroyed the
[47:37] father said we were cursed because you
[47:39] received that message but when when the
[47:43] brothers from the message just started
[47:45] helping their house you know he he felt
[47:48] different and you know he started
[47:50] talking to the pastor and he started uh
[47:52] listening to the testimonies and
[47:54] everything and later on he started
[47:56] attending the Bible said now the father
[47:58] is already baptized in the name of the
[47:59] Lord Jesus Christ amen so so sometimes
[48:03] the Lord has to do some things you know
[48:05] we cannot understand it but but he does
[48:07] things in in a very odd ways the next
[48:10] picture this a couple near the seashore
[48:12] lost everything and the ne the next
[48:14] slide would show uh this now their house
[48:18] the background this is the pastor over
[48:20] there amen so even the pastors are very
[48:22] thankful uh I know the the way that uh
[48:25] they receive all the help and the next
[48:27] slide maybe have three more pictures
[48:29] here this antia province this The House
[48:31] of the pastor he lost everything now the
[48:33] testimony here for two years because his
[48:37] the the place of the post of his house
[48:39] is being eaten by termites already and
[48:42] he doesn't have some money know to to to
[48:46] to replace it and so he was this is his
[48:49] testimony was always praying for two
[48:52] years he puts it in the into a prayer
[48:54] request that he needs uh you know uh he
[48:57] praying for God's provision to to to to
[49:01] replace the post and two years later
[49:05] this super typhoon came destroyed
[49:08] everything and he said Lord I I was
[49:11] asking for a new post and what you said
[49:13] is sent is a super typhoon destroyed
[49:16] even not only the post but everything so
[49:18] he was so
[49:19] hopeless he he he he was already
[49:22] planning to to to leave that place the
[49:24] church is just behind the church and so
[49:26] when when we when I went there uh uh I
[49:29] talked to him and uh uh just studied the
[49:32] extent of the damage and when when when
[49:34] help came we rebuilt the house and this
[49:36] is the next picture please so the house
[49:39] now complete he has he has his three
[49:41] daughters and said now I understand this
[49:44] was my answered prayer the Lord has to
[49:47] send typhoon so my post can be
[49:50] replaced and not only the post it was
[49:52] the whole house you know and so the next
[49:55] picture this is just beside the house
[49:58] it's like the room of of the three
[50:00] daughters and it's it's made of bamboos
[50:03] and and nepot it that's the normal uh
[50:07] the materials that they use in those
[50:08] places and so uh it was to the good
[50:12] thing here is before before it caved in
[50:14] they were able to move to the church
[50:16] building otherwise the these three
[50:19] daughters could have died so now it's
[50:21] this how it looks like now we just uh
[50:23] replace it and when when I ask the
[50:26] brother you would you like to to use
[50:28] some you know um better materials like
[50:31] concrete he said no he said uh there are
[50:34] others who need the help we don't want
[50:36] to take it all so just just bring back
[50:39] what what was there before so you can
[50:41] see that the attitude of the people they
[50:43] they don't want to take advantage they
[50:45] could have asked for more maybe you say
[50:47] brother Vernon make us a concrete you
[50:49] know house so it will be it will be more
[50:52] stronger and everything but they they
[50:54] have the thinking that uh uh in their
[50:56] minds that they they know that other
[50:57] believers are also in need and instead
[51:00] they I we cannot give them anything but
[51:02] we can if we will just get our own share
[51:05] we're contented with with having bamboos
[51:07] and everything and we know that God will
[51:09] protect this bamboo amen and so there
[51:12] you can see the smile in their faces how
[51:14] how they're happy to have to have like
[51:16] their little room there and the next is
[51:18] the just the church partially damaging
[51:20] the ceiling but uh so it was repaired
[51:23] now so now the next slide or the last
[51:25] picture the uh I mean everything is now
[51:28] fixed and uh it's all right now so again
[51:32] these brothers are very thankful for for
[51:34] all the things that uh I have there are
[51:37] so many pictures yet but we cannot show
[51:38] it everything but we are planning to
[51:41] send all the 200 more than 250 house all
[51:44] the pictures of it by April if it's be
[51:47] it will be finished and sent to all who
[51:49] has has given out for this uh or donated
[51:52] for this efforts as we were studying the
[51:55] list uh brother Nestor myself and
[51:58] brother Danny there uh of course uh this
[52:01] church under Brother Sam has given a big
[52:04] amount to to help us in in this uh
[52:07] expenses uh we we needed around 12.9
[52:10] million pesos uh which of course is uh
[52:14] uh big on our on our side but uh
[52:17] Believers from Ukraine Russia US Canada
[52:19] Germany New Zealand Australia I mean
[52:23] from all over South Africa they just
[52:25] sent even from India India a country
[52:28] that is as poor as ours but uh they they
[52:30] also send so what what the bigger
[52:32] picture we see that uh it's not just uh
[52:36] this is a group of a body of Believers
[52:38] helping one another having burden from
[52:40] one for one another and it just
[52:42] manifested the love for the bride and so
[52:45] again in behalf of the Filipino Brethren
[52:47] that were affected and all those who
[52:49] exerted also their efforts because it's
[52:51] not we're not the only ministers who
[52:54] were doing that there are other local
[52:55] ministers were doing their own uh
[52:57] efforts and uh again we we plan to
[53:00] finish everything by April put them back
[53:03] on their feet and then from there just
[53:05] just continue and as I was telling
[53:07] brother Samuel I I plan to go there
[53:09] maybe in April or maybe early may just
[53:12] to because we normally conduct medical
[53:14] Mission we have a doctor in our church
[53:17] and brother Samuel knows her he she's
[53:19] been uh M uh you know she's always ready
[53:23] to to do this medical Mission uh volun
[53:26] arily and so we when we were doing those
[53:29] uh those medical Mission earlier she she
[53:32] buys the medicine herself and you just
[53:34] give it out for free for this uh you
[53:37] know um brothers and sisters especially
[53:39] this small children so I took the
[53:42] initiative I I I ask for volunteers from
[53:45] our church and we put in some money
[53:47] together to buy to so we can be able to
[53:50] buy these medicines and when I as soon
[53:52] as I get back to the fil we will be
[53:53] scheduling a flight and maybe go to this
[53:56] areas
[53:57] and uh again it's it's not a uh uh it's
[54:00] not an outing that you go there I mean
[54:03] and the the the place is not uh very
[54:05] good it's it's good it's a good place
[54:08] because there are believers there but uh
[54:10] I mean like at this point in time it's
[54:12] you better stay in the city but uh I
[54:15] mean because of the love for concern for
[54:17] the brethen we will be doing that when I
[54:19] get back so we ask for your prayers and
[54:21] uh we we hope to finish this by
[54:24] everything by end of April and
[54:26] everything will be back to normal before
[54:28] another super typhoon comes amen and so
[54:31] that's that's about uh I would like to
[54:33] report to you and um uh as brother
[54:37] Samuel has mentioned that I tell the the
[54:39] other donors we will be accounting every
[54:42] single dime that we we receive because
[54:44] we want to be we are stewards of the M
[54:47] of this blessings we don't own it it I
[54:50] mean without you we we are just part of
[54:52] this team that is doing the relief
[54:53] efforts you are a big part of the team
[54:55] but there's there's somebody who has to
[54:57] do the leg work and some we we can't
[55:00] even do the leg work so we we tap the
[55:02] other believers there so again uh God
[55:06] has anointed everyone in the in the in
[55:08] the entire body of Christ to for this
[55:10] single effort and it has manifested the
[55:12] love of God so again thank you for
[55:14] everyone God bless you all and so uh I
[55:18] would like to invite you for a while
[55:19] just to to just to uh read a couple of
[55:22] scriptures just to just to make uh maybe
[55:25] a few minutes just to add exhortation to
[55:29] to what we have discussed and uh Clos
[55:32] this in
[55:33] prayer
[55:35] amen i' would like uh if uh I have a
[55:40] slide a slider maybe not show every
[55:43] slides and everything there but just to
[55:45] close this with the word of exhortation
[55:47] in in Isaiah 55:6 it says there seek ye
[55:52] the Lord while he may be found call ye
[55:56] upon him while he is near let the wicked
[55:59] forsake his way and unrighteous man his
[56:01] thought his thoughts and let him return
[56:03] unto the Lord and He will have mercy
[56:05] upon him and to our God he will
[56:08] abundantly pardon for my thoughts are
[56:11] not your thoughts neither your ways are
[56:13] my ways say the Lord for as the heavens
[56:15] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[56:17] are higher than your ways and my
[56:20] thoughts than your thoughts let's have a
[56:22] word of prayer our gracious Heavenly
[56:25] Father how with thank you for your words
[56:27] we thank you Lord for everything that
[56:29] you have done in order to connect each
[56:31] and every believer in the world Lord for
[56:33] a single effort Lord that that is meant
[56:36] Lord to to Bear one another's burden
[56:39] Lord and we thank you for the love and
[56:41] the concern of the congregation here
[56:43] that's led by our precious brother
[56:45] Samuel Dale Lord and uh Lord the his
[56:48] ministers here the elders Lord uh we
[56:54] their help to us Lord has been of great
[56:56] blessing and we pray that you bless them
[56:59] in return in many ways that you can oh
[57:01] God and as we speak your word I pray
[57:04] that you just encourage us Lord to do
[57:06] more for you we cannot understand your
[57:07] ways we cannot understand your thoughts
[57:09] Lord we're so limited but your your you
[57:12] are an unlimited God lord and we pray
[57:14] that you will reveal continuously
[57:16] yourself to us as we pray in the name of
[57:18] our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise
[57:21] the Lord may not be seated amen and so
[57:25] uh
[57:26] we have read in this scriptures that uh
[57:29] our thoughts are not the thoughts of God
[57:32] and our ways are not his ways and
[57:34] sometimes things happened and uh we
[57:37] cannot really understand what's
[57:39] happening or why is it happening see
[57:42] especially in a time of of catastrophe
[57:44] as as that and even if you are a
[57:46] Believer you you will be left you know
[57:49] thinking why does it us to happen to
[57:52] us we are all believing the same God and
[57:55] uh you know your trials here are
[57:57] different from our trials there but
[57:59] nevertheless we we will have to to to
[58:02] stand all those these trials and now in
[58:05] the in the in the slides here I just
[58:06] like to uh
[58:09] to to read a qu a quote in the Mighty
[58:12] God unveiled amen if you can put up
[58:16] please the the
[58:17] slide it says here back in the Old
[58:19] Testament we find out that God veiled
[58:21] himself for
[58:23] unbelievers God is a very oddway dealing
[58:25] with people he hides himself from the
[58:27] unbeliever and rebuilds himself to the
[58:30] believer and so we can we we can look at
[58:33] a certain uh thing and we can have two
[58:36] different thoughts like for example the
[58:38] Pharaoh was looking in one window and he
[58:40] saw all he saw was a group of M dubbers
[58:43] slaves but when Moses by revelations
[58:46] look at the same window what he saw was
[58:49] a chosen people of God and people can
[58:52] can listen to the same message one will
[58:54] get the Revelation the other has no
[58:56] effect on him but but that's the way God
[58:59] does his things the Bible says I'm the
[59:02] God and the I change not so it works
[59:04] according to brother bam it works in the
[59:06] same principle all the time amen so our
[59:09] faith is dependent on the Revelation
[59:11] that God gives you right our faith
[59:14] cannot go higher than what was revealed
[59:16] to us right and the the prophet said
[59:19] faith is a revelation see and uh our
[59:22] mind is so unlim is so limited amen the
[59:26] said God is uh God is infinite see again
[59:30] in in in this quote that I I want to
[59:32] read this quote
[59:34] again
[59:36] uh in the in the message we would see uh
[59:40] Jesus he said now remember we are finite
[59:43] our minds are finite God is infinite and
[59:46] infinite is perfect God knew the end
[59:48] from the beginning then you would say
[59:50] why would he permit sickness I will ask
[59:52] you this question which was first a
[59:54] savior or a sinner a savior and which as
[59:56] first said uh a Healer or sickness and
[59:59] of course the sick the the Healer comes
[1:00:01] first yes so God permitted it that he
[1:00:04] might uh project his love and power to
[1:00:07] the to the to the people see so when I
[1:00:09] when we we went to these areas we have
[1:00:11] to explain this over and over again to
[1:00:13] the people because they have heard this
[1:00:15] message but once you are in the middle
[1:00:17] of that trial it's a totally different
[1:00:20] thing you can memorize this quotation
[1:00:22] memorize it by heart have it in your
[1:00:24] mind you can you can even preach it but
[1:00:27] once you are experiencing it right there
[1:00:30] it's a totally different thing you you
[1:00:32] you have to you have to have the the the
[1:00:35] you have to Anchor yourself in the Lord
[1:00:36] Jesus Christ otherwise all this memory
[1:00:39] codes and the it will be gone right
[1:00:42] right it will beun and some of the
[1:00:43] people I mean the Believers there they
[1:00:46] they they were saying that uh I mean
[1:00:48] they were they were just saying that uh
[1:00:50] they they just they just want to go away
[1:00:53] and then you know but but of course
[1:00:55] that's that's where the the five-fold
[1:00:57] ministry comes in they have to encourage
[1:00:59] the people and I mean even the fivefold
[1:01:01] ministry they were affected you see the
[1:01:03] pastor lost his house and the the first
[1:01:06] when I was talking to the pastor his
[1:01:07] first struggle was how can I uh
[1:01:10] encourage somebody when I the one is
[1:01:12] needs encouragement yeah see and so when
[1:01:15] he when they started to know that many
[1:01:17] brothers or sisters are are concerned
[1:01:20] for uh in their in their state and their
[1:01:22] condition it it I mean it was it had a
[1:01:25] great impact on theirselves and uh it it
[1:01:29] just helped them so but we need the
[1:01:31] storms in life there there's these are
[1:01:34] literally storms but we have storms in
[1:01:36] our life we cannot evade it we we we we
[1:01:39] don't have a choice actually but uh
[1:01:41] whether we like it or not we have to
[1:01:42] face it see I I I will just read a
[1:01:45] couple more quotations then uh maybe
[1:01:48] I'll close on
[1:01:50] this uh in the message uh the ark
[1:02:08] okay he said Noah wouldn't have any
[1:02:11] victories wouldn't have been storms and
[1:02:13] trials if there's just put through a
[1:02:15] little safe tunnel to run through
[1:02:17] there's no joy he says is the storms of
[1:02:19] life it what makes us have the joy see
[1:02:23] but but you see some sometimes you
[1:02:26] cannot comprehend but I mean before
[1:02:29] during just immediately after the storm
[1:02:32] the people in in those places they you
[1:02:34] cannot sense any joy in their
[1:02:36] faces but you see after a week and they
[1:02:39] saw the bigger picture that's what we
[1:02:41] need to see the bigger picture so God is
[1:02:44] doing something and then we know he says
[1:02:46] he says here we'd never know the
[1:02:48] daylight was less we had some dark we'd
[1:02:50] never know what a Hilltop L there was a
[1:02:52] mountain we'd never know what good
[1:02:53] health was unless we had some sickness
[1:02:55] see and so all these things my brothers
[1:02:58] and sisters it's it's like what brother
[1:03:01] bam said about the law of contrast you
[1:03:03] have to see this things you have to
[1:03:04] experience these things so can we we can
[1:03:06] appreciate what we have sometimes we
[1:03:08] Things become so common and we can we
[1:03:11] don't we don't want I mean we are
[1:03:13] thankful but there there's really not a
[1:03:16] a a touch of deep gratitude on what we
[1:03:19] are enjoying but once these are taken
[1:03:21] away then you will have to treasure
[1:03:24] every inch of possession that you have
[1:03:26] every relationship that you have we we
[1:03:29] we just have we have a we just have a a
[1:03:32] a family in our church that lost their
[1:03:34] mother and uh I mean they're very young
[1:03:37] around 42 years old and sometimes I was
[1:03:40] talking to the brother and he he was
[1:03:41] saying how how how he missed his wife
[1:03:43] and you know he he started to say to
[1:03:48] tell me that uh now he he has seen the
[1:03:51] importance of you know having a Godly
[1:03:53] wife and uh you know going home home
[1:03:56] there your wife is waiting for you but
[1:03:58] all those years I mean things became so
[1:04:00] common so common and well things around
[1:04:05] you can get so common but as I heard
[1:04:08] some other somebody preaching about this
[1:04:10] message should not be common in us
[1:04:12] because this the message is not
[1:04:14] something that uh uh is it is something
[1:04:18] that will prepare us for the
[1:04:20] Rapture see and all the afflictions that
[1:04:22] are happening to us I mean we are in a
[1:04:25] third world country country and these
[1:04:26] things natural disasters are happening
[1:04:29] and I don't have I don't have any
[1:04:32] intention whatsoever to leave the
[1:04:34] country what where I was raised because
[1:04:36] I believe that God has placed us there
[1:04:38] for a Ministry we we need to be there we
[1:04:40] need to be to be helping our people and
[1:04:43] uh uh if you're not from that place you
[1:04:47] may say just simply go away and just
[1:04:49] leave in Another Place Another better
[1:04:51] place but I said that's the best place
[1:04:53] for me because that's where God placed
[1:04:55] me
[1:04:56] I I would not go in other places you
[1:04:58] know just uh uh some people say you have
[1:05:01] to get out of my comfort zone but that
[1:05:02] is my comfort zone where typhoons are
[1:05:05] and every day if I live in a place where
[1:05:07] there's no typhoon that's not my place
[1:05:09] right amen I I I'm born for the disaster
[1:05:12] and I mean and I and I I I I I God gave
[1:05:17] us something to to withstand everything
[1:05:19] that we have and so I was encouraging
[1:05:21] the brothers I was encouraging the
[1:05:23] sisters and I was encouraging those who
[1:05:24] were affected and now I mean after a few
[1:05:26] just just a few you know Filipinos are
[1:05:28] very resilient when you say resilient
[1:05:31] they they they just take advantage of
[1:05:33] what is at hand they they they look for
[1:05:35] more but of course you know people
[1:05:38] there's always mixed people you know
[1:05:40] there are those who take advantage there
[1:05:42] are those who who really are in need and
[1:05:45] that's why when I was coordinating with
[1:05:47] the brothers uh you know this help
[1:05:50] trying to help I I I would say brother
[1:05:53] Nestor brother Danny and myself we were
[1:05:55] just
[1:05:56] uh having these meetings and everything
[1:05:58] just to screen every uh request that's
[1:06:01] are coming in just to make sure that uh
[1:06:04] this these are not the things that uh
[1:06:06] you know being because there will be
[1:06:08] opportunist that will come out they will
[1:06:10] abuse the help they will so we don't
[1:06:12] want that to happen because if that
[1:06:14] happens then that's our stewardship we
[1:06:17] will be accountable for that and uh so
[1:06:20] we have to to to talk to the ministers
[1:06:22] to talk to the brothers and to explain
[1:06:24] to them because you know there's all
[1:06:28] some some of them would think that you
[1:06:30] know this this money coming in are just
[1:06:32] are just coming out of the abundance of
[1:06:34] the pockets of the Believers but as we
[1:06:36] know and uh uh having traveled in some
[1:06:39] places I know that there are other
[1:06:40] brothers and sisters who who get out of
[1:06:43] their way just to to to send some help
[1:06:46] for these third world countries and so
[1:06:48] we have really to explain it to them and
[1:06:50] sometimes when you explain it to them it
[1:06:52] doesn't it's not
[1:06:53] easy because it's a mindset
[1:06:56] they have a different mindset and you
[1:06:57] have to change that mindset and to
[1:06:59] explain to them and so any everything
[1:07:02] that is happening to us I I I believe in
[1:07:04] my in my own heart that God is allowing
[1:07:07] these things to happen because he's
[1:07:08] molding a character in us righten we God
[1:07:11] is not the business of character molding
[1:07:14] and and and and as the the scripture
[1:07:16] says the more the the Hebrews were
[1:07:19] Afflicted the more they increased they
[1:07:21] did not decrease when afflictions were
[1:07:23] coming they increased in number
[1:07:26] and spiritually speaking as we as we are
[1:07:29] afflicted we pass through these troubles
[1:07:31] we pass through this uh uh Temptations
[1:07:34] and everything the more our faith is
[1:07:36] increased amen the the people in in the
[1:07:39] Philippines they're worshiping the Lord
[1:07:41] before the typhoon but after the typhoon
[1:07:43] you could you could have seen the way
[1:07:45] they worshiped in those places it has
[1:07:47] more
[1:07:48] substance they're not worshiping in a
[1:07:50] way that uh um the worship is is with
[1:07:54] more substance because they experience
[1:07:56] the hand of the Lord as as as as I was
[1:07:58] saying in Genesis chapter 1 we chapter 2
[1:08:01] we can read that uh that Mo that Adam
[1:08:04] was a worshipper he worships the Lord
[1:08:06] amen but after the fall see when he and
[1:08:09] you know we were made to worship god he
[1:08:12] has a purpose the purpose one of the
[1:08:14] purpose that God created is for us to
[1:08:16] Worship the Lord see amen and and Angels
[1:08:19] were created to worship Him and the
[1:08:21] Angels were worshiping saying holy holy
[1:08:24] holy is the Lord they cannot say Lord
[1:08:26] you are our healer because the Angels
[1:08:28] never got sick they can say that uh the
[1:08:31] Angels cannot say that the the the Lord
[1:08:33] is is the Lord of Salvation because they
[1:08:35] were never lost but we have experienced
[1:08:39] this God has allowed these things to
[1:08:41] happen in our lives so when we worship
[1:08:43] the Lord amen there's more substance
[1:08:47] we're not saying that we're better off
[1:08:48] than the Angels but the Angels cannot
[1:08:50] worship the way we can worship because
[1:08:52] after the things that we have passed on
[1:08:54] we passed through we after the things
[1:08:56] that we have experienced in our life
[1:08:58] every trouble that we came through over
[1:09:00] and we overcame uh there's another level
[1:09:04] of worship that we
[1:09:06] do if if you are in
[1:09:08] need the way you pray at a time that
[1:09:11] compar it to a time that you are praying
[1:09:13] with not so much need your prayer is not
[1:09:16] that fervent right but if you are in
[1:09:18] need of something maybe somebody's sick
[1:09:20] in your house or maybe you are in need
[1:09:22] of some material things and you really
[1:09:24] need it so that you you you'll pray
[1:09:27] fervently but without those needs amen
[1:09:30] without those trials we can just you
[1:09:32] know say a word of prayer and that's it
[1:09:35] but I I can guarantee you my brothers
[1:09:37] and sisters when these families were
[1:09:39] were eating what was left the the the
[1:09:42] prayer just for a single meal amen just
[1:09:45] for a single meal you can hear the
[1:09:46] fervency of prayer how thankful they are
[1:09:50] for a for a simple meat and maybe simple
[1:09:52] fruit and uh just a glass of water for
[1:09:54] the whole family
[1:09:55] because there were no no more water
[1:09:57] around no more food around and whatever
[1:10:00] was left behind I mean in there was no
[1:10:03] refrigerator there was no cupboard or
[1:10:05] whatever what was what was left in their
[1:10:08] baskets or whatever they they were so
[1:10:10] thankful for that and God just
[1:10:12] multiplied all these things because he
[1:10:14] saw the he saw the heart of the people
[1:10:16] and sometimes God has to put put us in
[1:10:19] that kind of situation to put us into
[1:10:21] that kind of condition so we can express
[1:10:25] the the substance of worship we can
[1:10:27] worship of course we will not ask the
[1:10:29] Lord to give us those trials but he
[1:10:31] knows what to do he knows how to bring
[1:10:33] out the best in us on how can we can
[1:10:35] worship him and so you are we are
[1:10:38] thankful that you're very comfortable
[1:10:40] here and we are thankful in other
[1:10:42] churches that they're comfortable there
[1:10:45] and we are thankful in our in our
[1:10:47] country because uh things of like this
[1:10:50] sort to happen because I know the Lord
[1:10:53] is doing something for us I mean we have
[1:10:55] freedom of religion in in in the
[1:10:57] Philippines if you go to China you have
[1:10:58] to hide to preach but uh again we have I
[1:11:02] would say as I I say in Cloverdale we
[1:11:04] have different trials but the intensity
[1:11:07] is always the same I don't know about
[1:11:09] your trials here but I know you're
[1:11:11] you're also being tried and tested by
[1:11:13] the Lord molding your character and
[1:11:15] here's we we in our country are
[1:11:18] experiencing the same and every time we
[1:11:20] we go into these trials and overcome
[1:11:22] this then we we we we upgrade in the
[1:11:24] next Lev level then we upgrade in the
[1:11:27] next level until we reach that stature
[1:11:28] of a perfect man where we can say that
[1:11:30] uh we have everything that God do more
[1:11:32] us want purpose us to be and so it's
[1:11:36] very important my brothers and sisters
[1:11:38] to have this substance of worship and we
[1:11:40] can only get this I mean not not to to
[1:11:45] of course you have to study to meditate
[1:11:47] on the word and the message but God will
[1:11:49] give us
[1:11:51] situations conditions you know it may
[1:11:55] affect our health it may affect our
[1:11:57] relationship it may affect even our walk
[1:11:59] with the Lord but it is in these times
[1:12:03] that we can really manifest what is
[1:12:05] inside of our heart if there's no seed
[1:12:07] in there we'll just go away that
[1:12:10] explains how many message Believers have
[1:12:13] been in the message for many many years
[1:12:15] many many years and then one just some
[1:12:20] something happened and takes place and
[1:12:21] they just leave yeah they just leave the
[1:12:25] message it will always start okay it
[1:12:28] will always start in like for example
[1:12:30] this a certain person will just say
[1:12:32] something against the ministry but it
[1:12:35] also evolves from the ministry then you
[1:12:38] say something against the church right
[1:12:40] see and if it's left uh unnoticed then
[1:12:44] he will start saying something against
[1:12:47] the message then after the message he
[1:12:49] will say something against the prophet
[1:12:51] and the last thing he will say something
[1:12:53] many or many things against God right
[1:12:55] but it starts in simple thing something
[1:12:58] against the ministry or something about
[1:12:59] the the the church manage but it's kind
[1:13:03] of a spirit that crawls into every
[1:13:05] Church see and we have to be very very
[1:13:09] careful On th those things because uh I
[1:13:12] mean the prophet said uh he will not
[1:13:15] allow you know the the churches to be to
[1:13:19] loving one another he will the the the
[1:13:23] the prophet said God would allow you
[1:13:24] know Spirit you know just just to sit
[1:13:26] down there it's not a person even a
[1:13:28] person it's a spirit that crawls into
[1:13:31] every Church whether in the US or in the
[1:13:33] Philippines it happens all the time but
[1:13:36] I I said when this things happen like
[1:13:38] this catastrophe then you can just see
[1:13:40] the unity of the brothers and sisters
[1:13:42] you will know what's in the hearts of
[1:13:43] the people you they're con they're
[1:13:45] concerned for for the well-being of the
[1:13:48] people we know that this is just uh
[1:13:51] we're passing just to in in this earth
[1:13:53] and uh we will leave everything behind
[1:13:55] but while we are here on Earth you know
[1:13:58] we have to help one another we have to
[1:14:01] to to be praying for one another we have
[1:14:03] to think of other people not only for
[1:14:05] ourselves I was telling to to our
[1:14:07] congregation we are blessed because we
[1:14:08] are in the city we are blessed because
[1:14:10] we are not uh affected by the typhoon
[1:14:14] but I was as I was telling them we
[1:14:15] cannot just go home and take a rest
[1:14:18] brother Samuel has been in our church
[1:14:20] we're we're having a services in in a
[1:14:22] five star hotel we're just renting out
[1:14:24] but uh I mean it's very comfortable we
[1:14:26] can just stay there and pray there and
[1:14:28] just let's say we we'll just pray for
[1:14:30] the Brethren that's all and that's
[1:14:33] nothing bad about it you just pray and
[1:14:35] you send money but but I we had the
[1:14:37] burden we have to go there we have to
[1:14:40] fly over there we have to see the people
[1:14:42] there we have to stand side by side with
[1:14:44] shoulder toh shoulder with them and you
[1:14:46] know the impact of of what we did there
[1:14:48] and what you have done to help us to be
[1:14:51] able to do that I mean we did we did not
[1:14:54] just restore their houses we restored
[1:14:56] even their spiritual life we have
[1:14:59] restored their spiritual life
[1:15:02] amen and so again uh in behalf of the
[1:15:06] Filipino people I uh I I would like to
[1:15:10] say that uh things would not have
[1:15:12] happened the way it would would have
[1:15:14] happened if not for your help if not for
[1:15:16] your prayers we were just trying to
[1:15:19] compare the efforts of the United Nation
[1:15:22] because they were also helping the
[1:15:24] Filipino people
[1:15:25] and brother Nest was taking pictures and
[1:15:28] I mean the the United Nations they can
[1:15:30] only give small tents for the people and
[1:15:33] compared to what the Believers around
[1:15:35] the world that has done we were able to
[1:15:37] build houses finished houses for the
[1:15:40] people and so the go even the government
[1:15:43] were asking where are you people getting
[1:15:45] your money maybe you have a big
[1:15:47] organization or something maybe you you
[1:15:50] belong to a big denomination that would
[1:15:52] support when he said we don't have a the
[1:15:54] headquar we don't have a denomination
[1:15:57] but we have brothers and sisters all
[1:15:58] around the world who are concerned for
[1:16:01] for the people in the Philippines and
[1:16:03] they they are just wondering until today
[1:16:05] they cannot imagine that you know people
[1:16:07] just send the money just like that with
[1:16:09] no bureaucracy or whatsoever and just
[1:16:12] receive this and uh I mean uh just build
[1:16:16] the houses without no no strings attach
[1:16:18] or whatsoever and for us it's easy to do
[1:16:21] but for the others I mean they they
[1:16:23] until this time they are thinking it
[1:16:25] over and so we are thankful that our
[1:16:27] brothers and sisters they're not queuing
[1:16:28] the line asking for food they have their
[1:16:30] own food because we have put food in the
[1:16:32] in their table we are not uh the our CH
[1:16:36] the children of our brothers and sisters
[1:16:38] there they're not scattered in the
[1:16:40] streets you know Scavenging for food
[1:16:42] they have their own food already amen
[1:16:44] they have their own clothes they they're
[1:16:46] they're now under a roof and so if they
[1:16:49] can just you know just uh everybody if
[1:16:52] you can just just listen to their
[1:16:53] testimony you can you'll be touched by
[1:16:55] the way they express it and uh and just
[1:16:58] can imagine everything was wiped out and
[1:17:00] now they're back to normal so again God
[1:17:03] bless you and thank you for this
[1:17:04] opportunity to have uh to to be with you
[1:17:07] and to have spoken in front of you God
[1:17:09] bless you let's let's all bow our heads

[1:18:13] life a little bit better for the
[1:18:15] Brethren and evidently this congregation
[1:18:18] has done that many times in many places
[1:18:21] not only in the Philippines but I know
[1:18:23] that they they have done Mission Works
[1:18:25] in in different parts of the world and
[1:18:27] so Lord we're just thankful that we were
[1:18:29] able to connect with them and um we are
[1:18:32] just stewards of your manifold blessings
[1:18:34] oh God we cannot boast of anything that
[1:18:37] we have done we we cannot boast of any

[1:19:03] [Applause]
[1:19:09] amen can you say amen amen was great to
[1:19:13] see
[1:19:15] what you know God can do because he can
[1:19:19] use
[1:19:21] people and that's that's the way we're
[1:19:23] supposed to be right amen you know put
[1:19:25] your lags on your on the gospel go out
[1:19:29] put it out there and see you say well I
[1:19:32] I can't do that well that's we we can't
[1:19:34] go but we can help somebody else
[1:19:37] go and you know when we get over on the
[1:19:39] other
[1:19:40] side it still ain't going to be no big
[1:19:43] eyes little you it's going to be all of
[1:19:45] what he done through the bride of Christ
[1:19:48] we really appreciate these brothers
[1:19:50] there CU we know them all you know and
[1:19:52] they really over the years have learned
[1:19:54] a love them and learn to trust them and
[1:19:57] knowing that what they do and how they
[1:19:58] go and everything like that and see it's
[1:20:01] it's hard to send money to a a foreign
[1:20:04] field a lot of times because you you
[1:20:07] don't know what you're sending it to you
[1:20:09] know in everything it's just that's just

[1:23:07] and you know we can't all go and be
[1:23:11] missionaries but we can all have a
[1:23:13] little bit to do with it what does it
[1:23:16] matter who was it Moody that the the the
[1:23:21] lady just rented a building yeah and
[1:23:25] hired a preacher to come cleaned up a
[1:23:28] barn thing or something and going to
[1:23:30] have a
[1:23:31] meeting had one person
[1:23:35] come well she probably died thinking she
[1:23:39] was a failure cuz she probably thought I
[1:23:42] was led of the Lord to do this you know
[1:23:46] and she probably passed on thinking she
[1:23:48] was a failure but yet Dwight Moody
[1:23:54] you know
[1:23:56] what everyone that he preached to amen
[1:24:01] she gets the
[1:24:04] crowd right she gets the crown because
[1:24:08] she done what she was supposed to do and
[1:24:11] see that's all we can
[1:24:13] do we've been there we've seen things
[1:24:16] they're wonderful people and they do the
[1:24:17] best they can do that's and they don't
[1:24:20] complain that's right they they take it
[1:24:23] and move on
[1:24:25] and this storm come through and they
[1:24:26] proed it they take it they get right
[1:24:28] back up and go but you got to have
[1:24:30] brothers like these that'll go and do
[1:24:31] that but you got to have people that got
[1:24:33] money in their pocket and they can give
[1:24:35] it and the Lord can bless so if you have
[1:24:38] anything it's like I said if you want to
[1:24:40] ride out a check Rite it to the church
[1:24:42] then you get it off your taxes and then
[1:24:44] we just give it over to them and don't
[1:24:46] you worry about what is done because
[1:24:49] they'll do it they took up a $1,250
[1:24:52] offering last night at brother Lor at to
[1:24:54] fellowship meeting you know and that was
[1:24:57] good you know and that was that was
[1:24:59] great CU we appreciate it we didn't go
