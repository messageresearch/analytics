[11:18] [singing]
[11:21] &gt;&gt; How many desire that this morning or
[11:23] tonight?
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Day has gone so quickly. I feel like
[11:28] it's still morning.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; My body doesn't feel like it though.
[11:34] [laughter]
[11:35] But it's all right. It's good to be in
[11:37] the house of the Lord. How many are
[11:38] happy to be in the house of God? Amen.
[11:41] God given us another opportunity to
[11:42] gather together and to see one another
[11:44] and to hear the word of God. Um
[11:49] let's just go ahead and go to the word
[11:50] and then we'll read we'll read u a verse
[11:54] here and then we'll I'll have you be
[11:55] seated. Let's turn to Zechariah chapter
[11:58] 4.
[12:03] Zechariah chapter 4.
[12:05] very familiar scripture to us.
[12:08] And we'll start at verse five
[12:14] or verse Yeah, we'll start at verse
[12:17] verse six. Verse six, actually
[12:21] if you have say amen.
[12:23] Amen. The Bible says, "Then he answered
[12:26] and spake unto me, saying, This is the
[12:28] word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,
[12:31] saying, not by might, nor by power,
[12:35] &gt;&gt; but by my spirit, sayth the Lord of
[12:37] hosts."
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that it's the Holy
[12:40] Spirit that makes the difference?
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's not it's not manhandled,
[12:45] but it's it's God handled.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who art thou, oh great mountain?
[12:51] Before Zerubbabel, thou shalt become a
[12:54] plain, and he shall bring forth the
[12:57] headstone.
[12:58] This is our message for today. Amen.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Thereof with shoutings, crying, grace,
[13:05] grace unto it.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because it's grace, grace
[13:11] that it is given unto us.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; So we cry back. It's word. Amen. Word
[13:18] calling on it's word on top of word.
[13:20] Amen.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; So it's word brings brings attracts
[13:24] word. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just
[13:26] bow our heads this evening. Heavenly
[13:28] Father, we just thank you Lord once
[13:30] again for the opportunity that you've
[13:31] given us to read your word, Father God,
[13:34] and to just open back the pages of your
[13:37] word, Father. We realize that Lord, we
[13:39] are insufficient within ourselves. And
[13:42] Lord, no matter how many times we get
[13:43] behind the sacred desk, Father God, we
[13:46] still get nervous, Father. But Lord
[13:49] Jesus, we pray, heavenly father, that
[13:51] you would just, Lord, take full control
[13:54] and you would just have your way, Lord
[13:55] God Almighty. Because Lord, I know that
[13:57] I am not speaking, Lord, to just not any
[14:00] class of people, Lord.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to your body,
[14:04] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. But I
[14:07] believe, Father God, that this is the
[14:08] little portion that you have given us
[14:10] here on this side of the world, Lord.
[14:12] And I just pray, Lord, that you would
[14:14] just use my lips, Father God, to say
[14:16] something to them that would help them,
[14:18] Lord God. And we just commit the rest of
[14:20] this time into your hands. Meet our
[14:22] needs, meet the needs here amongst us,
[14:24] Lord. You know, all the requests. And
[14:27] Father God, may you just forgive us also
[14:29] for our sins. Cleanse us, Lord Jesus,
[14:32] when the areas that we've failed you,
[14:34] Lord God. Help us, Father God. Place it
[14:37] all under the blood so that we can enjoy
[14:39] you, Lord, this evening. We pray. We ask
[14:42] now and pray these things in Jesus
[14:44] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may have
[14:46] your seats this evening.
[14:49] Praise the Lord.
[14:52] Amen. Well, it's good to be back in and
[14:55] uh from our trip and uh everyone up
[14:58] there in Ohio, they send their
[15:00] greetings. Um and we had a good time.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. lots of f lot lots of fellowship
[15:05] and lots of lots of food. Uh I mean, you
[15:10] know how some of you that been up there,
[15:11] you know those people can cook. And uh
[15:14] so we had Thanksgiving meal on Thursday
[15:18] before leaving, then Thanksgiving meal
[15:20] uh when we got there on Friday and
[15:23] Thanksgiving meal on Sunday again. So
[15:25] three Thanksgiving. First time that's
[15:26] ever happened to me. Three Thanksgiving
[15:28] meals in one in in in one, you know,
[15:32] real really short time. So, but they all
[15:35] send their greetings and we had a good
[15:36] time with them on Sunday speaking the
[15:39] word to them. Um, brought them a a
[15:42] message of of of grace to them and uh
[15:46] and I believe it was timely for them.
[15:48] So, um they all are looking forward to
[15:52] seeing you all here in a couple of
[15:53] months, Lord willing. And uh when we got
[15:57] there, uh it was snowing. So, it snowed
[16:00] while we were there a little a little
[16:02] more, but then the real snow came in
[16:04] right after we left. And we had just
[16:06] barely missed it. And I think sister uh
[16:10] sister Jessica sent sent my wife a
[16:12] picture and it had snowed. I don't know
[16:14] how much, but it looked like it was
[16:15] about at least over 6 ines of snow.
[16:18] Eight eight inches maybe. And so, um so
[16:22] they're getting it. They're getting
[16:23] their winter really really really early.
[16:26] So, and uh so are we down here.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; It'd be nice to be able to see some snow
[16:32] down this way. So, but uh my wife says
[16:35] no. She she could care less about it
[16:39] [laughter]
[16:40] because we're heading towards the snow
[16:42] here in a couple of weeks up to Toronto,
[16:44] Canada.
[16:46] Amen. Well, praise the Lord, saints.
[16:48] Amen. I I brother Aaron, I appreciate
[16:50] you singing that song this evening
[16:51] because you didn't know what I was going
[16:53] to preach about, but that that that was
[16:55] I was going to touch on that on that
[16:57] topic. And uh and so uh uh what I I want
[17:02] to talk I want what I want to talk about
[17:03] this evening is is u I titled it u uh
[17:07] when grace rolls away the shame. Amen.
[17:11] And um and I've just been I've just been
[17:14] reading the book of Joshua uh lately.
[17:17] And of course, brother Brandham, you
[17:18] know, he typed it as as uh as the book
[17:21] of Joshua types the the the the book of
[17:24] Ephesians, you see. And so um if if if I
[17:29] brother Brandham says the following, he
[17:31] says this in the message u uh the God
[17:33] who is rich in mercy. He says, "Now, if
[17:36] many of you like to just mark down
[17:38] scriptures that a minister reads, and I
[17:40] would like for you to tonight,
[17:43] if you would to turn to Ephesians, and I
[17:45] was speaking last Sunday on the
[17:47] Ephesians, how that the book of Joshua
[17:50] was the Ephesians of the Old Testament
[17:53] and how it was a book of redemption,
[17:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[17:57] &gt;&gt; And redemption has two different parts.
[18:00] are coming out of
[18:02] &gt;&gt; and then entering into
[18:05] &gt;&gt; right
[18:06] &gt;&gt; first you have to come out
[18:08] &gt;&gt; right
[18:10] &gt;&gt; because you cannot enter into if you
[18:12] don't come out of what you already have
[18:14] &gt;&gt; okay
[18:15] &gt;&gt; trying to make sure I I go slow as well
[18:18] for the brother for the brother in there
[18:20] and I appreciate brother Emanuel taking
[18:22] you know taking
[18:24] &gt;&gt; filling in for me some people wants to
[18:27] bring the world the world in with them.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; But you got to come out of the world to
[18:34] enter into Christ.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to come out of unbelief
[18:39] to enter into faith. There cannot be one
[18:42] thing in your way to really have genuine
[18:46] faith.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Brandon continues saying, "You must
[18:49] absolutely leave everything that's
[18:51] contrary to the word of God behind to
[18:54] enter into faith."
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he continues saying here,
[18:58] "And that was the book of the Ephesians
[19:00] of the Old Testament, Joshua, where
[19:02] Moses represented the law
[19:05] could not save no one."
[19:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to keep that in mind as we as
[19:10] we speak on on on the topic tonight. But
[19:13] grace could.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; But there within within within the law
[19:20] there was an element of grace even
[19:22] within the law.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; But it could not bring the fullness of
[19:26] grace like it can after the after the
[19:28] the Lord's Jesus Christ. Amen.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; And here's Joshua is the same word like
[19:35] Jesus which means Jehovah Savior. And
[19:37] now then we found out that we have come
[19:39] to another Ephesians, another Ephesus.
[19:42] Now where that in our intellectual
[19:44] denominations and so forth and all of
[19:46] our educational programs has come to its
[19:49] Jordan then we must have an Ephesians
[19:52] again. Brother Brandham says we must
[19:54] have an exodus to come out and go into
[19:58] for the rapture.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so when we're reading the book
[20:04] of Joshua, you know, we we look at the
[20:05] book of Joshua and we and we always look
[20:08] at it as a book of conquest and a book
[20:10] of uh uh victory victory and and and and
[20:14] things like that and which it is. It's
[20:16] it definitely is. But if you if as I was
[20:19] speaking to the group there in in in
[20:21] Ohio, if you look at the first five
[20:23] chapters, especially the first five
[20:25] chapters of the book of Joshua, you see
[20:28] an abundance of grace that is being
[20:30] applied to the people of Israel in those
[20:34] first five chapters.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Because you have to think about this
[20:38] that children, the children of Israel,
[20:41] this is the second generation that's
[20:43] getting ready to cross the the the
[20:45] Jordan River. The first generation that
[20:48] came out of Egypt, they were
[20:50] circumcised.
[20:52] They had the the the they had they they
[20:54] they were they were the people of God
[20:56] who were who kept the commandment and
[20:58] were circumcised. They had the mark on
[21:00] them, you see. But they were they they
[21:03] they came out on a journey and they came
[21:06] out already being led by a prophet. And
[21:10] yet during the time of the wilderness
[21:13] journey to get to the promised land, oh
[21:15] my, they were very excited, very happy.
[21:17] And it's just like the believer today,
[21:19] you know, the new believers that come in
[21:21] or maybe the Pentecostals. Amen. At one
[21:23] point in time, they were excited, very
[21:26] happy, coming in speaking, shouting
[21:28] tongues and and all that stuff. You see
[21:30] those those first ones that came in, the
[21:33] ones that came out of Egypt, they came
[21:36] out circumcised, but they were
[21:37] circumcised as babies. That's right.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal babies.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; They came out, you know, with with this
[21:45] with this. That's why and God just
[21:47] winked at the ignorance
[21:49] &gt;&gt; and they and that's why they majored on
[21:51] tongues and they majored on on on on on
[21:54] signs and and and things as such,
[21:58] &gt;&gt; which is what the people which is what
[22:00] some people today are wanting to bring
[22:02] us back to. Yeah,
[22:05] &gt;&gt; if you're not careful, they are trying
[22:07] to lead us back to that original
[22:10] circumcision.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; And remember that the children of Israel
[22:14] when they crossed into the promised
[22:16] land, they had to be circumcised again.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; But that circumcision was a different
[22:22] circumcision. And it wasn't a group
[22:24] circumcision.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; This was an individual circumcision.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; All right, we're going to read about it
[22:31] here in just a moment. Amen.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; So I I want us to to think about it in
[22:35] this in the in the in the on the basis
[22:38] of grace
[22:39] &gt;&gt; because when you are thinking when you
[22:43] are wanting to go back to the way the
[22:45] way things were the way things were was
[22:48] law
[22:51] &gt;&gt; right
[22:52] &gt;&gt; it was it was let us let us go back to
[22:55] the law because that's easier to go back
[22:58] to that.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; But that's a trick of the devil. Amen.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Because we don't want we want, like I've
[23:05] always said, and I can't get away from
[23:07] this topic because it's this thing keeps
[23:08] piling up on me, but revelation is hard.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; It's not an easy thing. It's a difficult
[23:17] thing for you to get in oneonone with
[23:21] God
[23:22] &gt;&gt; to obtain revelation.
[23:25] But when it's a group idea or when it's
[23:27] a group thing or we're just following a
[23:30] personality or follow that's easy.
[23:33] Everybody else is doing it so I'll just
[23:36] do it too.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; That's why the children of Israel uh uh
[23:41] out of Egypt it you know you know of
[23:44] course they were travailing. They were
[23:45] crying you know for a deliverer for God
[23:47] to fulfill the promise that he promised
[23:49] that he was going to deliver. And he
[23:51] delivered them with a mighty hand didn't
[23:52] he? Right. But now as they journeyed
[23:56] through the throughout for for 40 years,
[23:58] they were journeying for throughout uh
[24:01] uh through the wilderness.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; And those children that were born from
[24:06] the original to the second generation
[24:08] message believers.
[24:10] [laughter]
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Now we're coming into the third
[24:13] generation message believers.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Right? They better they better get into
[24:20] Amen. into that second
[24:23] &gt;&gt; circumcision.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we're not going to make it.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; But I believe we have people here that
[24:28] are making it.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Right? Those second generation message
[24:32] believers, they had to come in the exact
[24:35] same way that their parents came in.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now it was a deeper walk.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz Joshua was leading them now,
[24:44] &gt;&gt; right? It wasn't just a prophet now. It
[24:46] was the Holy Spirit. Amen. It was a
[24:48] personal thing. Yes.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Moses didn't circumcise the the
[24:54] the the the the children of is they were
[24:56] already circumcised.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; We'll look at that here in just a
[25:00] moment. But if you let's let's go let's
[25:03] go to Joshua chapter 5. And you want to
[25:05] read here with me.
[25:08] We'll just kind of go through this and
[25:10] let's see how the Lord leads. Amen. But
[25:14] right before Joshua chapter 5, we see
[25:16] that that you know the children of
[25:18] Israel, we see the grace that God showed
[25:21] to to in and in Joshua chapter 2, the
[25:24] grace that God showed even to to uh to
[25:27] Rahab, right? A woman that had not even
[25:31] that did not even had not even been with
[25:34] the children of Israel or Moses and
[25:37] crossed the Red Sea. But she said to the
[25:39] two spies, she said that that that I
[25:43] have heard, we've heard that that God
[25:46] opened up the sea for you and that you
[25:48] crossed on dry ground and and we were
[25:51] afraid and we feared
[25:54] &gt;&gt; a woman that that that was a gentile
[25:56] that did not believe God, but only all
[26:00] she did was hear about God
[26:02] &gt;&gt; and that drew her
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. closer to God. That was the heart.
[26:05] That was the grace that God was shown
[26:08] that showed to Rahab. And we know the
[26:10] story of how the children of Israel go
[26:12] in in chapter 6 in the same book. And
[26:15] Joshua himself goes in and rescues
[26:17] Rahab. Sends the two spies over there
[26:19] too and say, "Go get Rahab right."
[26:22] &gt;&gt; What the grace of God in this hour.
[26:24] Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; That it doesn't matter your background.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Your background doesn't matter to God.
[26:31] It's what you believe now.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's it's it's it's your
[26:35] belief. Amen. It's your heart that God
[26:37] is looking at. Praise the Lord. God's
[26:40] not looking at what you did back then or
[26:42] what you did 30, 40, 50 years ago. Amen.
[26:44] God is looking at what your desire is
[26:46] now. Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; And if anybody would try to put that on
[26:52] you, Amen. try to put that shame back on
[26:54] you. Amen. You just take it back to
[26:56] chapter five where God shows him
[26:58] complete grace. Amen.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; The grace of God is much greater than
[27:03] that. Amen.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Much greater than your shame. Much
[27:07] greater than anything that you have done
[27:08] when you were out there in the world.
[27:09] Amen.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; The grace of God. If if God cannot cover
[27:13] anything in your life that you have
[27:14] done, then what kind of God are we
[27:16] serving?
[27:18] &gt;&gt; What kind of God are we serving? That he
[27:20] can't cover anything any any sin. Amen.
[27:23] That we have may have committed
[27:25] especially when we did when we did it
[27:27] ignorantly.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Paul said, Amen. that the things that I
[27:30] that he was he was he was locking
[27:33] Christians up and he was killing
[27:34] Christians left and right ignorantly.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; And God winked at it.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; What the grace of God. Oh, but that's
[27:43] God's people that he was touching. Yes.
[27:45] But then yet he became the a pastor, a
[27:49] messenger to the church to the church
[27:51] age.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; A great man of God
[27:54] &gt;&gt; that even the messenger of our age
[27:56] identified with the great apostle Paul.
[27:59] Amen.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; And it didn't matter the life that he
[28:03] had lived before.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; It still it it it didn't it didn't stop
[28:08] him from preaching the gospel.
[28:11] [laughter]
[28:12] &gt;&gt; He still was the messenger for the age.
[28:14] Amen.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, so then we
[28:19] find here in Joshua that after Joshua
[28:22] chapter 2, then we we were we were
[28:24] speaking last time about Joshua chapter
[28:26] 3. Now the children of Israel, they were
[28:28] crossing into the the promised land.
[28:32] Right
[28:33] &gt;&gt; now just think about this for a moment,
[28:35] saints, that the children of Israel,
[28:37] these children of Israel, this second
[28:39] generation were crossing into the
[28:41] promised land fulfilling
[28:43] the commission that God had given to
[28:46] Moses that God had given originally to
[28:48] Abraham then to them came down to Moses
[28:52] and then Joshua had the commission. Now
[28:54] these second generation of of of of
[28:58] children of Israel were going to fulfill
[29:01] this promise
[29:03] and yet they had not fulfilled within
[29:06] themselves everything that was required
[29:08] to be identified
[29:10] &gt;&gt; as God's people.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were not circumcised.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; And what is circumcision?
[29:20] Circumcision is the cutting away of the
[29:22] flesh or the cutting away of the old
[29:25] life, so to speak.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; But yet, the grace of God was able to
[29:31] cover that.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, my think about that.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Because God is more concerned about
[29:38] fulfilling his word.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; God is more concerned. He said, "I you
[29:45] will I will give you that land." Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; And that land was not going to be it was
[29:50] not going to be taken by the ones who
[29:52] had died in the wilderness
[29:54] &gt;&gt; who were circumcised who had everything
[29:56] everything ready to to go. You know,
[29:59] they had it all. They had the Holy
[30:01] Ghost. They had everything that you
[30:02] couldn't put a hand on them. But their
[30:04] unbelief
[30:06] &gt;&gt; and wanting to go back to Egypt
[30:08] &gt;&gt; and wanting and and and and living and
[30:10] wanting things easy
[30:12] &gt;&gt; cuz they they had they had everything
[30:14] provided for them. I mean, you think
[30:16] about it in a journey like that where
[30:18] God was, you know, you go to Walmart
[30:20] today and you grocery shop, you ain't
[30:22] coming out of there for less than $200.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; I mean, even with $200, I mean, you are
[30:28] you hardly have anything in your buggy.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; I remember when in back in the 80s when
[30:33] we were we came to the States and we
[30:35] were grocery shopping, I my dad and my
[30:37] mom, they had that buggy full. I mean,
[30:40] it was all kinds of cereal boxes and all
[30:43] kinds of meat and all kinds of things.
[30:46] And and it wasn't a Walmart brand
[30:48] either. And it wasn't it wasn't the the
[30:50] it it was like Lucky Charms and and
[30:52] cataloges and post and and the good
[30:55] ones, right?
[30:56] &gt;&gt; The ones that taste, you know, they
[30:58] don't taste fake, even though it's all
[31:01] fake. [laughter]
[31:04] But I mean, it was the good stuff.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; And I remember I remember I was there. I
[31:09] was seven years old and I looked at the
[31:11] guy and it it makes you feel good as a
[31:13] kid. Wow, my mom and dad are buying.
[31:15] Wow. You know, and they they paid I feel
[31:18] it was 90 something bucks and the and
[31:20] the and the cart was full. I mean, we
[31:22] had groceries probably for like the next
[31:24] three weeks, maybe a month, you know,
[31:27] and but now 90 90 something bucks,
[31:31] you're only coming out of there with a
[31:32] box of crackers and maybe a loaf of
[31:34] bread, maybe some peanut butter and
[31:37] jelly, maybe. Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; And a thing of coffee cuz eight eight
[31:42] eight coffee cups
[31:45] &gt;&gt; for your for your curig
[31:48] &gt;&gt; at 95 bucks,
[31:50] right? But you see the people of the
[31:53] children of Israel, Amen. They had
[31:54] everything provided for them. They
[31:56] weren't concerned about the $100, $200
[31:58] or anything like that. The Bible says
[32:00] that even their shoes did not go did not
[32:03] did not waste. Their clothes still
[32:05] stayed the same. Amen. My goodness,
[32:08] that's that's that's amazing. I wish I
[32:10] had clothes like that. But with God,
[32:13] Amen. all things are possible.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; So God was taking care of them and they
[32:17] were used to the easy living where God
[32:20] was providing quail for them and and God
[32:22] was providing the the blessings would
[32:25] easily fall on them
[32:27] &gt;&gt; and then would come down and and all
[32:29] they had to do was just was believe God
[32:32] sent a prophet. [laughter]
[32:34] &gt;&gt; That's all they had to believe. That's
[32:37] all they had to follow was what is what
[32:39] Moses gave them and they just believed
[32:42] it
[32:42] &gt;&gt; and it was easy. Oh, the blessings of
[32:45] the Lord came down very easily. But now,
[32:48] you know, we see that that generation
[32:51] was dying out, right? And if you type it
[32:55] with this generation now, the old
[32:57] fighters as brother Brandham called it,
[32:58] they're dying out now.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; And here's rising up the second
[33:02] generation.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. that that does not know anything
[33:06] about Egypt. But yet we as parents and
[33:10] yet we as pastors and and us we expect
[33:14] them to come in the same way we came in
[33:18] &gt;&gt; and they don't know anything about Egypt
[33:22] &gt;&gt; and then you wonder why you're scr
[33:24] they're scratching their scratching
[33:25] their heads and like why can't they see
[33:26] it?
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Why? I don't understand why my kid can't
[33:29] see it the way the way I see it. It's
[33:30] because you experienced things that they
[33:32] haven't. They were born in this message.
[33:35] You weren't.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; You you you went out and and and kissed
[33:39] girls and kissed guys and and did things
[33:42] and drank alcohol and majority of these
[33:44] kids don't know anything about that.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; But you wonder why in the world they
[33:49] don't believe.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; And so you see, you cannot you you can't
[33:56] put those burdens on top of them that
[33:58] way expecting for them to come out the
[34:00] same way you came. Right? It's a whole
[34:03] different time, saints,
[34:05] &gt;&gt; but it's the same word.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; And so God And so God, Amen, wants us,
[34:12] Amen, to use wisdom and the way we deal
[34:15] with our children in the hour that we're
[34:16] living in. Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; You have to use wisdom. You can't use
[34:20] the old tactics be of of old. Amen. And
[34:24] say, "They're going to come out exactly
[34:25] the way I want them to come out." It's
[34:27] not going to work. Believe me, it's not.
[34:29] [laughter]
[34:33] It just won't. Your your toughness and
[34:36] your Amen. It it'll keep them It'll keep
[34:40] them obey obey obeying for a little
[34:43] while.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; But as soon as they get that driver's
[34:46] license,
[34:48] &gt;&gt; they're gone.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; But don't be don't be don't be saddened
[34:55] and don't be hopeless. You planted a
[34:58] word in there.
[35:01] Amen. [applause]
[35:03] &gt;&gt; You did what you were supposed to do
[35:06] &gt;&gt; and then let the Lord take care of the
[35:08] rest.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Right? So, we see that the children of
[35:13] Israel, the second generation now,
[35:15] they're coming in and they're walking in
[35:16] in chapter 3. They're coming in and they
[35:19] crossing crossing into the promised
[35:21] land. They were they were obeying. They
[35:23] had nothing else to do but to obey
[35:26] Joshua who was the command who was the
[35:28] one commanding in charge. And they say
[35:30] in chapter one they said everything that
[35:32] you tell us Joshua we will obey. We will
[35:35] obey. You see a people that were not
[35:37] circumcised. I want you to think about
[35:39] that.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; They were not circumcised but yet they
[35:43] had that desire to obey.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Think about the people that they have
[35:49] the desire to serve the Lord.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Right? Maybe they have not been
[35:53] circumcised yet.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe they're not doing everything
[35:56] exactly the way you think they should do
[35:58] it.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; But if the desire is there,
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just be salty.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Be soft. Be salty. Amen. All right. So
[36:08] then they cross over. They cross over
[36:10] into the promised land.
[36:12] But the true the true battle happens
[36:15] after they get they cross over. Amen. In
[36:18] chapter 4, God tells them to to make a
[36:21] memorial of 12 stones and memorialize
[36:25] that grace that they have just received.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; To memorialize that that that that God
[36:33] did for them because they didn't deserve
[36:35] it.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Right? They were not circumcised.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; They were technically not people part of
[36:42] the covenant.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Did you ever think about that?
[36:47] that the this second generation of the
[36:49] children of Israel were not technically
[36:51] according to the law of Moses were not
[36:53] part of the covenant but the grace of
[36:56] God.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; All right. So now we come here to ver
[37:01] chapter 5
[37:03] and and let if we if we just turn there.
[37:07] Amen. And it says here in Joshua chapter
[37:10] 5, "And it came to pass when all the
[37:12] kings of the Amorites, which were on the
[37:15] side of Jordan westward, and all the
[37:17] kings of the Canaanites, which were by
[37:20] the sea, heard that the Lord, they heard
[37:23] that the Lord had dried up the waters of
[37:25] Jordan from before the children of
[37:26] Israel until we were passed over that
[37:29] their heart melted."
[37:32] &gt;&gt; All right. They got scared,
[37:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:36] &gt;&gt; All right. We had they these kings
[37:38] probably heard that the children of
[37:39] Israel they're they're uh they had
[37:41] crossed the Red Sea in the exact same
[37:43] way and now they were crossing the
[37:45] Jordan the exact same way. That means
[37:46] they're inching closer and closer which
[37:49] if they're inching closer and closer
[37:51] that means their God is inching closer
[37:52] and closer too right and it says it says
[37:57] before the children of Israel until we
[37:58] were passed over that their heart melted
[38:00] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[38:02] because of the children of Israel.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I I want you to think about
[38:07] this because in the next several verses,
[38:09] what's getting ready to happen, the
[38:12] children of Israel needed time to do
[38:15] what they're getting ready to do,
[38:17] &gt;&gt; they could not they could not get
[38:19] circumcised, have the Passover, and the
[38:22] things that they're getting ready to
[38:23] take place when if they're fighting. So
[38:25] you notice the grace of God upon their
[38:28] life right here. Even causing those
[38:31] kings to be afraid of them
[38:33] &gt;&gt; which stopped them in their tracks
[38:35] because those kings could have come over
[38:36] there to them and started war with them.
[38:39] Hey, they're they're they're getting
[38:40] closer. And and really in in a tactical
[38:42] sense, if you see them coming from far
[38:45] off or even if you hear about them go
[38:47] coming from far off, you go see what's
[38:49] what's what you know, you go meet them
[38:51] closer to a battlefield instead of them
[38:53] getting closer to my home, right? So, so
[38:58] that what the grace of God upon these
[39:00] people, amen, upon the children of
[39:02] Israel here in order to stop the enemies
[39:05] around them. Amen. And I want you to
[39:07] realize, saints, that the things that
[39:08] God has done, amen, to get to where you
[39:10] are at now, what has God stopped in your
[39:13] life, what kind of accidents did you
[39:15] that God free you from? What kind of
[39:18] enemies, Amen, health enemies or or
[39:20] issues or situations that God, Amen,
[39:23] prevented for you to be able to get and
[39:25] walk through with God. Amen. And in the
[39:27] hour that you're living in, Amen. Oh my,
[39:30] there's there's God's done great things.
[39:33] And and that's why we we when when we
[39:35] sing that song uh uh think about the
[39:37] blessings of the Lord of what God has
[39:39] done. Showers of blessings. Amen. And
[39:41] those things Amen. We have many things
[39:44] to give him thanks for.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have so many things to give him
[39:50] thanks for.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; So God put in that grace and gave that
[39:57] grace there when even you didn't deserve
[39:59] it. But God knows the way that he has
[40:03] planned for you. He knows. He knows
[40:05] exactly what he has
[40:07] &gt;&gt; and he's going to make sure that you get
[40:08] there. Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Now, in verse
[40:11] two, it says, "And at the time, at that
[40:14] time, look, notice how the scripture
[40:16] puts it. At that time, the Lord said
[40:20] unto Joshua, make thee sharp knives, and
[40:24] circumcise again the children of Israel
[40:27] the second time."
[40:29] And Joshua made him sharp knives. Verse
[40:32] three. And circumcised the children of
[40:35] Israel at the hill of the four skins.
[40:38] Amen.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice that it's
[40:41] Joshua doing the circumcision right
[40:43] here.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; All right. And it's not it's not they
[40:47] themselves doing it,
[40:50] &gt;&gt; right? And it's not their mama and daddy
[40:52] that did it. Because when mom and daddy
[40:54] did it, it was on the eighth day when
[40:56] the when the boy was was just eight days
[40:59] old, right? These these men, they were a
[41:02] grown man,
[41:03] &gt;&gt; right? They had come to something now.
[41:06] They had seen some things.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. They had just passed Jordan, which
[41:10] is a a type of a death.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a justification.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Right. And now they're coming, amen, to
[41:19] a to a point where
[41:22] they they need to have an own experience
[41:24] with a Joshua in their life, right, with
[41:27] the Holy Spirit.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's the Holy Spirit that
[41:30] circumcises you.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spiritual circumcision.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. To cut off excess flesh.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Right? I want you to realize and think
[41:41] that the people that are crossing over
[41:43] this they're crossing over and this is
[41:46] not oh we're crossing over and
[41:49] everything it'll be just fine right
[41:51] after that. No, this right here types
[41:54] the life of the believer.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Canaan types the life of the believer
[42:00] and it's after it's after them crossing
[42:03] over. Amen. And it's after them
[42:05] fulfilling these things that they're
[42:07] we're we're getting ready to read is
[42:08] when the wars start,
[42:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[42:11] &gt;&gt; It's when the battles really start.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; It's when the issues really come up.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Right? And you so you wonder the things
[42:18] that you're might be going through or
[42:20] the things that are happening in your
[42:21] life. I wonder if maybe if you are doing
[42:23] something right
[42:26] &gt;&gt; because that's when the battles really
[42:27] start,
[42:30] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been a Christian for for a
[42:33] long time,
[42:35] but no matter how long you've been a
[42:37] Christian, Amen. There's still battles.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; There's still territory
[42:42] &gt;&gt; to to continue take over, taking over,
[42:44] but but God has already given it to you.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has already given to you the
[42:49] land.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it so he tells them to at verse
[42:53] two to make sharp knives and circumcise
[42:56] again the children of Israel the second
[42:58] time. Amen. the second time, meaning
[43:00] that they did not get circumcised when
[43:02] they left Egypt. But now it's time to
[43:04] circumcise them because God won't get
[43:07] away from his word.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just going to let these second
[43:12] generation of message believers get by
[43:15] without an experience with God.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Right? You're not going to get by. Amen.
[43:20] The way the way your mom and dad
[43:22] received it, that's how you got to
[43:24] receive it. Amen. If they got the new
[43:26] birth, then you've got to have the new
[43:27] birth. Praise the Lord. It might be
[43:29] different experiences, but you have it's
[43:31] the new birth anyhow.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; It's a change. Amen. That's got to take
[43:35] place. And Joshua made him sharp knives
[43:38] and circumcised the children of Israel
[43:40] at the hill of the foreskins. And this
[43:42] is the cause. Now, in verse four, he
[43:45] tells them the reason why he does this.
[43:47] And this is the cause why Joshua did
[43:49] circumcise. All the people that came out
[43:52] of Egypt that were males, even all the
[43:55] men of war, died in the wilderness. By
[43:58] the way, after they came out of Egypt,
[44:01] &gt;&gt; the Bible says that they died because of
[44:03] their unbelief.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Right. And they died. And whether it was
[44:09] neglect or whether it was it was that
[44:12] the, you know, the parents just didn't
[44:14] instruct their children of what to do or
[44:18] they just didn't care.
[44:21] These second generation of believers or
[44:24] message believers did not get
[44:27] circumcised
[44:29] &gt;&gt; when God was going to make sure if I'm
[44:30] going to have a people, if I'm going to
[44:32] have a bride in this hour, Amen. I'm
[44:34] going to make sure that they are filled
[44:35] and baptized with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And so in verse four, he says, and and
[44:42] this is the cause. So we just read that
[44:45] died in the wilderness by the way after
[44:47] they came out of Egypt. Now verse 5. Now
[44:50] all the people that came out were
[44:52] circumcised
[44:53] came out of Egypt. But all the people
[44:55] that were born in the wilderness by the
[44:57] way as they came forth out of Egypt them
[45:01] they had not circumcised.
[45:04] For the children of Israel walked 40
[45:06] years. Think about that. 40 years
[45:11] in the wilderness, till all the people
[45:14] that were men of war, which came out of
[45:17] Egypt, were consumed, because they
[45:20] obeyed not the voice of the Lord.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Unto whom the Lord swore that he would
[45:25] not show them the land which the Lord
[45:27] swore unto their fathers that he would
[45:29] give us a land that flowth with milk and
[45:32] honey. Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, Amen, they were
[45:36] consumed completely by their unbelief.
[45:38] Amen. And verse seven, and their
[45:40] children whom he raised up in
[45:42] theirstead, damn Joshua circumcised, for
[45:45] they were uncircumcised, because they
[45:47] had not circumcised them by the way. All
[45:50] right. Now, verse eight. And it came to
[45:52] pass when they had done circumcising
[45:56] all the people that they abodeed in
[45:59] their places in the camp till they were
[46:03] whole.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to think about that
[46:05] statement because remember God stopped
[46:07] their enemies
[46:09] &gt;&gt; in verse one.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; All right. God knew that they were
[46:13] needing time to heal.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Right. And and and and and look and look
[46:18] how the scripture says it there that
[46:20] they had done circumc.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I want I want to read this
[46:30] here with just a moment because I
[46:33] remember a couple of weeks ago where I
[46:35] was speaking about with regards to
[46:37] brother Bram talking about the third
[46:38] pool. Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; And and brother Bram says this in 1956
[46:43] because remember in 1906 it was a was
[46:46] 1906 a Soua Street.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; All right. Now it's 1956 when he says
[46:52] this right here. 50 years
[46:55] &gt;&gt; 1956.
[46:57] All right. And he says, "And then when
[46:59] it did, this one that was standing by me
[47:02] behind me, the same voice." He's
[47:04] speaking about the vision that God was
[47:06] showing him about that little room,
[47:08] right? The angel's voice, the angel's
[47:11] voice. It wasn't just an angel's voice.
[47:13] It was the angel's voice. He said, "I'll
[47:17] meet you in there."
[47:20] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what has happened with
[47:22] the children of Israel now with their
[47:24] circumcision. They have to stay in their
[47:26] place.
[47:28] is resting in God, resting in the
[47:31] promise.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That God is going to continue
[47:33] fulfilling everything until they come
[47:35] out whole. [laughter]
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "I'll meet you in there,
[47:41] and this is the this is the third pool,
[47:43] but nobody will know nothing about it."
[47:47] Amen. Nobody. It's a secret thing.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; You think anybody anybody else was going
[47:52] to go go in there with those with those
[47:54] with those men? Amen. It was it was just
[47:56] it was a secret thing,
[47:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And it's got to be a secret thing in
[48:00] this it wasn't a group circumcision now.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Just like the first the first the first
[48:04] children of is of Israel. Now this is
[48:07] something secret. And this is why God is
[48:09] calling us in this hour. Amen. To a
[48:11] secret thing between him and between the
[48:14] mighty angel and you.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because the reason why I say
[48:20] the saints is because many people are
[48:22] coming to a point where they they you
[48:25] know shouting and speaking in tongues
[48:28] and we got we just got to get back to
[48:29] all of that and all that has its place.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; But it's Pentecostal babies that that
[48:35] that desire those things,
[48:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:40] &gt;&gt; The what what a a true mature Christian
[48:43] desires is intimacy.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] And intimacy can only come one by one on
[48:50] one,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:53] &gt;&gt; When Joshua was there circumcising each
[48:55] one of those males, it was one by one,
[48:58] [laughter]
[48:59] &gt;&gt; right? Cuz he he he he's only one
[49:01] person,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; right? So then, so then it it's a
[49:05] one-on-one thing and it's not a group
[49:07] thing.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, anybody that's trying to tell
[49:10] you to go go back to Pentecost, let's
[49:12] come back to the, you know, to the
[49:15] sawdust trail and all that, that's all
[49:17] good and fine. Amen. But that is not
[49:19] what God is calling us in this hour.
[49:21] Amen.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; God, the open book, Amen. Revelations 10
[49:25] is a private thing between
[49:27] &gt;&gt; the mighty angel and Christ and you.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Because even brother Brandham had to
[49:34] leave the scene there in Revelations
[49:35] chapter 10. [laughter] Right? He was
[49:39] only there for one verse
[49:40] &gt;&gt; and even he had to leave
[49:43] &gt;&gt; and leave that that book was it was it
[49:46] was it was in the mighty angel's hand.
[49:48] Right?
[49:48] &gt;&gt; And it was a thing between you and
[49:50] Christ. Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; I just I I you know I I I look at
[49:55] sometimes and I wonder sometimes and I
[49:58] you know I love these brothers and and
[50:00] that that's okay. I love listening to
[50:02] their preaching, but I wonder sometimes
[50:03] if if if what they're trying to take us
[50:05] back is to is to uh just emotions
[50:10] and and and and and and repeating things
[50:12] and constantly, you know, and and that's
[50:16] that's fine. Amen. But still, the word
[50:18] is what's going to give me a body
[50:19] change, right?
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Emotions, Amen. They just come and go.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Emotions just come and go. Amen. You're
[50:26] going to feel tired on Monday after
[50:29] jumping and screaming and dancing on
[50:32] Sunday and doing praise breaks.
[50:38] Yeah. I mean, but but Amen. But the word
[50:41] Amen. carries you forward
[50:44] &gt;&gt; for good. For good.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That intimacy with with the word.
[50:47] I'm not I'm not I'm not downing, you
[50:49] know, shouting and screaming. That all
[50:52] has its place. But that is not the the
[50:55] uh the the foundation of of of of moving
[50:59] on with Christ.
[51:02] All right. So, Brother Brandham
[51:04] continues saying, I said, "And well, I
[51:06] don't understand why is why in there?"
[51:08] Brother Brandham asked him. He said,
[51:10] "Why there?" Because the angel just told
[51:12] him, he said, "Nobody will know anything
[51:14] about it. Nobody. The world does not
[51:16] know what's going on in a believer's
[51:18] life."
[51:20] &gt;&gt; A true genuine believer. Amen.
[51:23] If it's a true genuine believer, not
[51:26] even people even within our same ranks
[51:28] know truly what's going on.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; If it's a true go called born again
[51:34] believer. Amen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Because why? This is an individual walk.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, I don't understand.
[51:39] Why in there? Why there?" He said, "It
[51:42] will not be a public show this time."
[51:46] Amen.
[51:48] Pentecost was a public show.
[51:51] It's not it's not now.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Right now is an experience between you
[51:56] and the mighty angel because who was in
[51:58] this room? It was the mighty angel.
[52:00] Right?
[52:01] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I don't understand going
[52:03] into that closet building like that."
[52:07] And so, of course, in Matthew 6:6, Jesus
[52:10] says, "But thou, when thou prayest,
[52:12] enter into thy closet, and when thou has
[52:14] shut the door, pray to thy father which
[52:16] is in he in secret." Amen. Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; And thy father which seeth in secret
[52:21] shall reward thee openly.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; So according to the prophet the third
[52:25] pull is the opening of the word
[52:28] personally to you.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; He says in the in the message the
[52:33] anointed times and the the anointed ones
[52:35] at the end time. He says notice the very
[52:37] day when this messenger not when he
[52:39] starts on but when he begins to declare
[52:41] the message. See the first pool healing.
[52:44] Second pool prophesy and third pull the
[52:46] opening of the word. the mysteries
[52:48] revealed. No more there is no more
[52:51] higher order to reveal the the the word
[52:53] the than prophets. But the only way the
[52:56] prophet can be vindicated is by the
[52:58] word. And remember the third pull was
[53:01] the opening of them seven seals
[53:04] &gt;&gt; to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[53:06] sealed in the word. Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; So that is what that is what we are
[53:12] seeking after. We're seeking after the
[53:15] the the the revelation, those those
[53:17] thunders. Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; That are the mysteries contained in the
[53:20] seven seals,
[53:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Screaming, jumping, shouting, and all
[53:26] those things. That's that's good. And
[53:27] and I I I I I love it myself.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. But afterwards, man, I I I I after
[53:34] the dust settles, I I want the opening
[53:36] of the word to me
[53:38] &gt;&gt; personally. And I want that screaming
[53:41] and shouting and all that to take me
[53:43] closer to Christ.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's not just an emotional
[53:47] workup for the moment,
[53:49] &gt;&gt; right? Because
[53:51] when the when they came out of the upper
[53:53] room, they were speaking in tongues and
[53:56] and and and really what they were
[53:58] speaking was languages.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; They weren't blabbling and they were
[54:01] they weren't making, you know,
[54:05] and those things like that. That's not
[54:07] what they were doing. Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And they were not just reciting Bible
[54:12] verses either.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; As some people who say, "Oh, he's
[54:17] prophesying, thus sayith the Lord." And
[54:19] then they just recite Bible verses.
[54:21] That's not prophecy. That's already in
[54:23] the scriptures,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; right? But see, people want to take us
[54:28] to those things. And if you, like I
[54:30] said, if you don't have discernment,
[54:32] you'll fall for it.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You will fall for it. But that's not
[54:37] what that that's not what it is. They
[54:39] came out speaking and what the 3,000
[54:41] understood what they were saying
[54:44] &gt;&gt; because it caused them to say what what
[54:47] does this mean?
[54:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, what should we do? What what is
[54:51] the next step that I should do? If they
[54:53] didn't understand they what they were
[54:54] hearing, then they wouldn't have asked
[54:56] that.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; But they were they they understood and
[54:59] Peter told them, "Repent, be baptized."
[55:02] And there are 3,000 souls added to the
[55:04] to the to the body that day. All right.
[55:09] Okay. So, in so here in verse four, and
[55:11] I'm I'm I know I'm just going
[55:12] everywhere, but you forgive me.
[55:16] Now uh so in verse 9 or verse eight and
[55:20] it came to pass when they had done
[55:22] circumcising all the people that they
[55:23] abode in their places in the camp till
[55:26] they were whole. They they had to make
[55:28] sure that they were whole before they
[55:29] continued taking the city the the land.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; You can't go and take the land when
[55:34] you're sick spiritually
[55:37] &gt;&gt; when you don't have the Holy Ghost. You
[55:39] can't take the land
[55:41] &gt;&gt; when you don't know. Amen. where what
[55:43] where God has called you from and where
[55:45] he's taken you. You can't you can't you
[55:47] can't move on.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; You've got to know. Amen. You've got to
[55:51] stay in there with Christ until you're
[55:53] whole.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. In that little room.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Joshua, verse 9,
[56:01] this is where I want to focus on. And
[56:02] the Lord said unto Joshua, "This day,
[56:05] this day, Amen. God is a present God."
[56:08] Amen. How many thank God that he is ever
[56:10] present
[56:12] &gt;&gt; in your time of trouble, in your time of
[56:14] need.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This day have I. Joshua
[56:19] didn't do it. Nobody else did it. Have
[56:21] I? He himself personally came in
[56:25] because it was he that who was in that
[56:27] in that room with them in that little
[56:29] closet.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Right. This day have I rolled away the
[56:32] reproach of Egypt from off of you.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:39] after they were circumcised,
[56:42] after receiving the baptism of the Holy
[56:44] Ghost, so to speak,
[56:48] there is no more reproach on your life.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And there some anybody, amen, would try
[56:54] to put reproach on you. Amen. When you
[56:58] know where you have been,
[57:00] &gt;&gt; you know what experience you've had,
[57:02] &gt;&gt; you know the things that you that you
[57:04] encountered, you yourselves. Amen.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] Because if anybody would try to put
[57:10] those things, amen, on you, lay those
[57:12] things back on you, you know, it's got
[57:13] to be nothing but the devil. Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; God is not a God is not God is didn't
[57:19] call us, Amen, to walk with him so that
[57:22] he could condemn us.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; No, he walked us to us to be free,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; for us to enjoy his grace, for us to
[57:28] enjoy his mercy, for us to enjoy the
[57:31] benefits that he has, the benefits of
[57:33] the land.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And and and so why are we
[57:38] why do we want to go back to Egypt?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; See, the reason why God was rolling away
[57:45] a reproach is because they were slaves.
[57:47] They had a slave mentality.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; All their lives, all their 40 years that
[57:52] they were crossing the the the the
[57:54] wilderness, they they they had a slave
[57:56] mentality upon their their mind. I mean,
[57:59] even the the calf that they built, the
[58:01] golden calf, a calf represents a a slave
[58:04] slave animal.
[58:06] even that represented their mentality.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; So, so, so they had this mentality of of
[58:14] burning and and and we're and we're
[58:16] still Egypt was way far away from them
[58:18] now, but they still had that burden upon
[58:20] them that
[58:24] &gt;&gt; But God right here in verse 9 was trying
[58:26] to get take take that he said, "I am
[58:28] taking away that reproach that that that
[58:32] stain that Egypt left you." Yes.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that you can go take the land.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And you know what?
[58:42] What? And and it it happened there in
[58:44] Gilgal. And Gilgal, if you look at if
[58:47] you look at what the word Gilgal means,
[58:49] it means to roll away,
[58:51] &gt;&gt; right? Because notice the way he says it
[58:54] here. I'm bring it up right here. Um,
[58:57] in Joshua 5:9 is it says, "And the and
[59:01] the Lord said unto Joshua, this day have
[59:03] I rolled away the reproach." Amen. If
[59:06] you roll something, Amen. It means it
[59:08] was heavy. [laughter]
[59:11] Amen. It means that that that that it
[59:13] was something heavy. It wasn't just
[59:16] something light. It was something that
[59:18] was burdening you.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; It was something that was causing you
[59:21] trouble.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; It was something that was really
[59:24] hindering you. Amen. But by the grace of
[59:26] God. Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; By the grace God has brought you to this
[59:30] perfect grace, saints. And he's rolled
[59:32] that burden away from your life. Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It was the Lord Jesus Christ when
[59:37] he went he when when he went to Lazarus.
[59:39] Amen. He said, "Roll away that thing
[59:41] that's getting in the way of Lazarus
[59:43] coming out." Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because I don't know how big
[59:46] the tomb was. Maybe it was a small tomb.
[59:49] But if Lazarus would have raised in
[59:50] there, he might not have room to take
[59:52] off the bandages.
[59:55] He said, "But roll away that thing, that
[59:58] mentality that is keeping from Lazarus
[1:00:01] coming out. Then he could come out and
[1:00:03] say, "Now go ahead and loose him." Loose
[1:00:06] him. And
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Then you could be loose.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Then you can be free.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Do not go think back on how things were.
[1:00:16] Because if you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:20] God's given you, shown you grace, Amen.
[1:00:23] And then God's rolled away that
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; that burden from from Egypt.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; And he did it a long time ago.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] So he was he he he was removing that
[1:00:35] that heavy burden. Amen. This shame of
[1:00:38] Egypt, it points to everything Egypt had
[1:00:42] left on them, including their identity
[1:00:45] as slaves. Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; You're not identified now with Egypt
[1:00:49] anymore.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] He continues saying, "This day have I
[1:00:54] rolled away the reproach of Egypt from
[1:00:55] off you. Wherefore the name of the place
[1:00:58] is called Gilgal unto this day."
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you thankful? Amen. That
[1:01:02] God has rolled away all our shame.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. All our all our all our all our
[1:01:09] old identity is under the blood of Jesus
[1:01:11] Christ.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be remembered no more.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:18] Praise God. Because how can we serve God
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; when we still have our old identity?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't dress like Egypt anymore.
[1:01:27] Maybe we don't talk like Egypt anymore.
[1:01:30] But it's just as bad still having the
[1:01:33] mindset of Egypt,
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; the thoughts of Egypt,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Egypt, Egypt. And and you just keep
[1:01:41] hearing the cracking of the whit. You
[1:01:43] did. You did it. You did it.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; You can't move on with Christ. Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; You can't move on.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; But remember remember the book of Joshua
[1:01:54] is a book of redemption.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And it types Ephesians
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; verse 10. I'm I'm moving a little
[1:01:59] quicker now. And the children of Israel
[1:02:02] encamped in Gilgal and kept the Passover
[1:02:05] on the 14th day of the month at even in
[1:02:09] the plains of Jericho. Now
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; why did they do this? Why did the
[1:02:13] children of Israel kept the Passover?
[1:02:15] Well, if you go back and read the
[1:02:17] children of Israel, there were they only
[1:02:20] had celebrated Passover one time when
[1:02:22] they were getting ready to come out of
[1:02:24] Exodus. There was another time that they
[1:02:26] celebrated it, but it would had been
[1:02:28] already 14 40 years almost 40 years that
[1:02:31] they had not celebrated Passover. And it
[1:02:34] it was because they were not
[1:02:36] circumcised.
[1:02:38] Because if you read in in Exodus 12
[1:02:40] verse 43-49,
[1:02:42] the Lord told him that you can't take
[1:02:45] Passover until you're circumcised.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot partake on the Lord's
[1:02:51] table if you have not been circumcised.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Spiritually, right?
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; So the entire wilder wilderness
[1:03:00] generation, they couldn't keep it. This
[1:03:02] generation could not keep it because
[1:03:04] they were not circumcised. Amen.
[1:03:06] They were not circumcised. But now
[1:03:08] that's been taken care of. So now in
[1:03:10] verse 10, they're happily take Passover.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The eating of the lamb.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a it's a transition.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; From now from just eating mana and just
[1:03:22] eating food that's been provided. Now
[1:03:24] we're starting to eat some some more
[1:03:26] some solid food. Now the lamb. Amen.
[1:03:28] Which represents Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:03:30] Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] In verse 11, and they did eat of the old
[1:03:35] corn of the land on the tomorrow after
[1:03:38] the Passover, unleavened cakes and
[1:03:40] parched corn in the selfsame day.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] Amen. Of course, we know that that that
[1:03:47] the corn, Amen. represents, Amen. the
[1:03:50] the the the new life. Amen. The the the
[1:03:53] word
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; that's now that you eat after
[1:03:58] the circumcision. Circumcision. Amen.
[1:04:01] after you have experienced that life
[1:04:03] with Christ. Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You can't eat off the old denominational
[1:04:06] things anymore,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; you can't eat off the old mana anymore.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't fulfill you. It just
[1:04:12] doesn't satisfy you.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes you you you might
[1:04:16] you listen to a to a nominal preacher
[1:04:19] preaching and you're like, "Well, that
[1:04:20] was good, but there's still something
[1:04:22] there that I'm just not getting."
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; You know, it's just not the same. Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we've even visited
[1:04:30] some some message churches and and you
[1:04:32] know, you understand you know that
[1:04:34] people can only preach at the level that
[1:04:36] they're at, right?
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; But you you leave sometimes and you're
[1:04:39] like, h I know there was more there,
[1:04:41] [laughter]
[1:04:43] right? But you they can't jump higher
[1:04:45] than their pastor. So they have to you
[1:04:48] have to give them grace, right? Because
[1:04:50] God's given us grace.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; But now we are able to partake of the
[1:04:56] old corn of the land.
[1:04:58] Everything that's grown in Canaan now we
[1:05:00] can partake of.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's no excuse in this
[1:05:03] hour.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. To go hungry.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:09] And they did eat of the old corn of the
[1:05:11] land on the tomorrow after the Passover
[1:05:12] and 11 cakes and parched corn in the
[1:05:14] selfsame day. And the mana, watch verse
[1:05:16] 12. And the mana ceased on the marorrow
[1:05:19] after they had eaten of the old corn of
[1:05:22] the land.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; They had they had the teeth to to eat
[1:05:25] it. spiritual teeth to eat it.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, no more man of Amen. God was
[1:05:31] that it. It's now time to fight.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It's now time to live off the life of
[1:05:38] the food that you eat.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spiritually.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; What you eat, Amen. is what you become.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; So, it's now time to live off of that
[1:05:48] life.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because it's time for us to
[1:05:52] because now they're getting ready to
[1:05:54] fight. Now the battles are getting ready
[1:05:56] to come.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the hard part.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because maybe eating off the mana
[1:06:03] and meeting eating off the just the the
[1:06:05] angel food wasn't going to be enough for
[1:06:08] them to be able to take over Jericho.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; It was enough for the wilderness
[1:06:12] journey,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't enough to go take the
[1:06:14] land.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it's time to take the land,
[1:06:17] saints.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this this this this thing
[1:06:21] now, Amen. has transitioned. Amen. And
[1:06:23] it's not just about God send a prophet
[1:06:25] now.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; It's not just about, oh, you know, uh,
[1:06:28] you know, I'll dance in the spirit,
[1:06:30] shake the the pastor's hands or speak in
[1:06:32] tongues or or or feel a little emotion
[1:06:34] and and that's it. No. Now, now it's
[1:06:37] time for you to recognize your position
[1:06:39] in in the word.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Where is God calling me to? Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Because God's given me a destiny
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; and I must go fulfill that.
[1:06:50] Amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; But the only way to fulfill that is for
[1:06:53] you to eat off this corn.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Off this corn.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or this this this this food.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And it's hard sometimes.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; It's hard, but it's needful.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; You want a body change,
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; you want to see the dead raised,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; you better eat off the gold corn.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm just waiting for the
[1:07:20] pastor to give it all to me. That's
[1:07:22] that's mana.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's easy.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; You let the pastor study and just give
[1:07:27] you everything. That's easy. You're
[1:07:30] going to die.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; You're going to die like the first
[1:07:32] generation of the Israelites, you're
[1:07:34] going to die. But the second generation
[1:07:37] that God showed so much grace to,
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; grace. Amen.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Why is it crying out with grace? Grace.
[1:07:45] The capstone's crying out grace. Grace
[1:07:47] unto it.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're shown grace, you want
[1:07:50] to give out grace.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; And this is grace. Amen. This grace will
[1:07:57] take us through. This grace will cause
[1:07:59] us, Amen. to see my position in the
[1:08:02] word.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I know we speak a lot on these
[1:08:07] things with regards to our position in
[1:08:08] the word, but what does that exactly
[1:08:10] mean? It means just be God wherever you
[1:08:14] are now. That's right.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are now, where where God
[1:08:18] has called you now, that's where you
[1:08:20] need to be God.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; No, but I think I can serve him in uh
[1:08:24] the grass is greener on the other side.
[1:08:27] That's what a lot of people think,
[1:08:32] but that might may not be the case.
[1:08:36] Sometimes we think that there's a better
[1:08:37] church for us somewhere else or that
[1:08:40] there's there there there's a better
[1:08:41] group and you know and that the grass is
[1:08:43] better and and everything is better
[1:08:45] somewhere else. Amen.
[1:08:48] And you've neglecting Amen. where God
[1:08:50] has brought you from
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; and where you are now.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; And it was the grace of God that brought
[1:08:56] you there.
[1:08:59] Oh, but they they speak in tongues over
[1:09:01] there and they shout and and they got
[1:09:03] they got the sisters all running up in
[1:09:05] front of the church all in, you know,
[1:09:06] everybody and they're bobby pins flying
[1:09:09] everywhere. Oh, you know, the spirit of
[1:09:11] God is there.
[1:09:15] It may be, but I don't know if those
[1:09:16] sisters really serve the Lord on Monday.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; You don't know.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; You're just going through emotions.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; I don't know that. It's not for me to
[1:09:25] judge that.
[1:09:27] But that is not the foundation of my my
[1:09:31] walk in Christ.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That is not what I depend on. If for me
[1:09:34] to feel
[1:09:37] a little, you know, uh what is it?
[1:09:39] Shivers down my back or anything like
[1:09:41] that. I can't depend on that.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Because those things can be copied.
[1:09:47] That's right.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; There are genuine shivers
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; and there are genuine jumpings and
[1:09:54] shoutings and there are genuine tongues
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; and there are genuine but we we we put
[1:09:59] it all on tongues and we forget that
[1:10:01] that's that's the lowest of the gifts.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; The one of the the greatest ones are
[1:10:06] wisdom and knowledge.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Those are greater
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; and that's what people are lacking.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. discernment.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; But they and so and so those those
[1:10:18] things uh there was a point that I was
[1:10:21] getting to with that. But those things
[1:10:23] Amen. those things only last for a
[1:10:25] while.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're temporary.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Babies do that.
[1:10:34] babies, you know, babies squirm and and
[1:10:38] scream and shout and and cry because
[1:10:42] they have a need and that's the only way
[1:10:44] they know how to do it, right?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's genuine, right?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's genuine. But as they're feeding
[1:10:51] and they're growing, they can't continue
[1:10:53] screaming and shouting and and and and
[1:10:56] no, now they're they're they're speaking
[1:10:58] now. Now they're talking.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Mom, I'm hungry.
[1:11:04] You got some lucky charms around here
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; or whatever. Cocoa puffs.
[1:11:10] I like I like cocoa pebbles,
[1:11:16] you know, and then and then they they
[1:11:17] start growing up and then now now
[1:11:19] they're asking for food. They're still
[1:11:21] asking for food, but now there's more
[1:11:23] maturity about it,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; There's not that jumping, I got to feel
[1:11:27] something
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; or cry about it. A
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; why cry? Speak.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] And so see the the the when they what I
[1:11:40] meant to say earlier is when they came
[1:11:41] out of the upper room and they were
[1:11:43] doing those things and they were they
[1:11:44] were Amen.
[1:11:47] there it it was because it was because
[1:11:50] the they were babies in Christ, right?
[1:11:56] When there's when there's a lack of the
[1:11:58] word there,
[1:12:00] then you do that,
[1:12:03] right? That's why young people need
[1:12:05] that.
[1:12:07] Sometimes we criticize when they go to
[1:12:09] youth camps and and they they get into
[1:12:11] into the into these into the into these
[1:12:14] frenzies and I think about it in the way
[1:12:16] of they're just babies. They need this
[1:12:19] in order to get to the better things.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:12:25] So again, if that's how God works with
[1:12:28] you, that's great. That's your emotional
[1:12:31] makeup, and that's fine, right? But you
[1:12:34] can't tell me that I need to dance and
[1:12:37] shout and scream and and and speak in
[1:12:39] tongues in order for me to have an
[1:12:41] experience with God.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; That's not anywhere in the word. But yet
[1:12:46] be careful because some people are
[1:12:48] trying to take us back to that
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; because what people don't understand in
[1:12:53] the word, they'll just they'll just tack
[1:12:56] it on things like that.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; When they don't understand the word and
[1:13:00] they can't explain, you know, God's
[1:13:02] given us this open book, seventh seal,
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Then they try to take us back to Egypt,
[1:13:08] back to bondage.
[1:13:10] And when there whenever there's bondage
[1:13:12] and when there whenever there's Egypt
[1:13:15] then then what happens after that?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; It becomes idolatry.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; There's churches that we know of they
[1:13:23] were under bondage under legalism
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; and what did end up becoming idolatry
[1:13:33] and they're tore up now.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; So you be careful.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. This thing is a secret thing. Why
[1:13:41] Why did God tell brother Brandham,
[1:13:43] "Amen." in the last in the in the hour
[1:13:45] that we're living in. This is between
[1:13:46] just you and the angel.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Just you and the angel.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, sure, we're going to have
[1:13:52] emotions. We're going to that there
[1:13:54] going to be things that are going to
[1:13:55] happen, but ultimately, it's got to be
[1:13:57] you and Christ.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Got to be you and Joshua in that tent.
[1:14:01] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And last verse, and I'm I'm
[1:14:05] finishing. Let's come up. And the mana
[1:14:08] ceased on the tomorrow after they had
[1:14:09] eaten of the old corn of the land.
[1:14:11] Neither had the children of Israel mana
[1:14:13] anymore.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Anymore. They had no mana anymore. But
[1:14:19] but that was God's food. Yes, it was
[1:14:21] God's food and it worked for a time. It
[1:14:23] was good for a season, but God is
[1:14:25] turning the corner now.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; God's turning the corner now.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; But they did eat of the fruit of the
[1:14:33] land of Canaan that year.
[1:14:38] And when you receive the full word and
[1:14:40] you're eating the old corn, then the
[1:14:42] then who steps in and fights your
[1:14:43] battles?
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; The mighty angel comes in.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Because it says in verse 13, "And it
[1:14:49] came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho
[1:14:51] that he lifted up his eyes and looked,
[1:14:52] and behold, there stood a man over
[1:14:54] against him with his sword drawn."
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Who who who what what did Christ have a
[1:15:00] man open in Revelations 10:1?
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; An open book. A a a sword drawn. Amen.
[1:15:06] [laughter] Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; It was ready to go.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; He's fighting your battles
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; if you've done what is required.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And Joshua went unto him and said unto
[1:15:17] him, "Art thou for us or for our
[1:15:18] adversaries?" And he said, "Nay, but as
[1:15:20] captain of the host of the Lord, am I
[1:15:23] now come?"
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now he's come. Amen. Now the
[1:15:29] angel, now that the the redemption has
[1:15:31] has taken place now in Revelations
[1:15:33] chapter 5, Redemption for the for the
[1:15:37] for these children of Israel has
[1:15:39] happened now. Right
[1:15:42] now the captain of the Lord can come.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him come. Hallelujah.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And Joshua fell on his face to the earth
[1:15:49] and did worship and said unto him, "What
[1:15:52] saith my lord unto his servant?"
[1:15:54] Right? In other words, take the the the
[1:15:58] little book. [laughter]
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's giving him the He's going to
[1:16:04] give him the word.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; And the captain of the Lord's host said
[1:16:07] unto Joshua, "Loose thy shoe from off
[1:16:09] thy foot, for the place wherein whereon
[1:16:12] thou standest is holy." And Joshua did
[1:16:15] so. In other words, he gave him
[1:16:16] something to do.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Like in Revelations 10:11. Amen. Thou
[1:16:20] must prophesy again.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; We don't just stand around with our arms
[1:16:26] crossed and you know we we we got
[1:16:28] something to do.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz now it's time to take the land.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it's time to get to a to a
[1:16:33] body change.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Now it's time to fulfill that that no
[1:16:37] one else has fulfilled. Amen.
[1:16:39] Thessalonians has spoken of. Amen. That
[1:16:41] we must go and fulfill that.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Because the captain of the Lord said so.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; It's time to take the land, saints.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:16:56] [applause]
[1:17:01] Grace in the hour grace has removed the
[1:17:04] reproach off your life.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Do not go back
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; or let anybody put you back.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; And say that you must fulfill something
[1:17:14] in order for you to keep walking with
[1:17:16] Christ. The captain of the Lord's told
[1:17:17] me different.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; That that burden that burden has been
[1:17:23] rolled away. Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; What was heavy now is no more.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe we sing that same song again,
[1:17:33] brother. Or unless you had something
[1:17:34] else, but that same Canaan song that you
[1:17:36] sang.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] Amen.
