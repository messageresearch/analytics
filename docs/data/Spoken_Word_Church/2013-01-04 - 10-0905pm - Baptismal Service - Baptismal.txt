========================================

brother how prom much will you ask the Lord's blessing baptism Church bless dear father thankful this afternoon for this Gathering here this special occasion people Lord pray God that word of God will take hope into their hearts grow multiply might be a blessing father pray Lord that you bless each and every one this pray that you guide each one of us and let us be encouragement unto them Father as they ende we have three already so if anybody else decides while we're at it be glad to baptize anybody else I always like to read the scripture in in Romans to kind of express the things and you know where we can put it into the scriptural part never nobody should have any problems about what we the way we do because we're going be baptize to fulfill you hear me say to fulfill what the Lord Jesus said to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost the only way you can do that is baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but father son and Holy Ghost is not a name that's right that's just title so then it's Lord Jesus Christ see that is father son Holy Ghost so it'll fulfill I like to read what Paul said in Romans here Romans 6 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein now that's what your baptism means you're dying at a water grave and you're coming back up to walk in newness of Life That's what example as far right know you not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin see that's what it means you're going to die to yourself and be raised to walk in newness now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies No More Death ha no more dominion over him for in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God now watch likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed un sin but but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen that's what our what our examples are for baptism don't save you it's an answer of a good conscience in other words you're doing what God Said So we let the little girl come first then she's number one we got a little little Nala wants to be baptized anybody else that wants to be then you come on go

and I knew we were moving to Georgia and I don't really know how I was baptized I had no preacher at the time I wasn't sitting under a Ministry and I wanted to know that I was baptized thank you Father I baptized a lot of people over that were baptized before the only thing that I've ever made a stipulation to anybody there A lot of times and I had to baptize if you were in a n inational church that baptized under regeneration which a lot of the the Jesus name people they did do that and they would baptize under regeneration in other words believing that your baptism was your regeneration and I've always encouraged people even though they were baptized correctly to go and get make sure you're baptized CU you don't want it to be under regeneration you want it to be under
