[14:06] of this six in that section and I'm
[14:07] looking at all this piling up nothing

[14:59] they said but the next morning the
[15:01] police came to the service I don't know
[15:03] how they got there but they came and
[15:05] brother Freddie came down to the side of
[15:07] the building just at the door like this

[19:15] says I've never seen a squirrel not
[19:17] alone seen one here so so amen

[21:44] photographs I had a peg so they did it
[21:46] all up for the meetings you know and I
[21:48] was taking this stuff and putting up a
[21:50] plate and I said the pastor I shouldn't
[21:52] have said that I said him what's that
[21:54] and he said well that's the intestines
[21:57] and the heart and the liver of the pig
[21:59] you know and some kidneys you know I
[22:01] said don't tell me anymore I don't want
[22:05] to know you know I'm going to eat this
[22:07] little bit here that's all I want to
[22:08] know
[22:09] but actually the the cubes of a pig meat
[22:12] was you know cooked was quite nice but
[22:15] they eat the fat and everything but I
[22:17] couldn't do it but the meat was actually
[22:18] night but that that's why I'm mentioning
[22:20] that but because the Lord so it was
[22:22] wonderful and you know you may think oh
[22:25] that's hard brother Donny but you know
[22:27] something I've always burn it over the
[22:28] Lord we've got a great God we've got a
[22:31] great God you know and if he gives you a
[22:33] hard day you can be sure you'll get a
[22:34] busy day so when we left
[22:37] there went back went back to Manila you
[22:40] know we got everybody one o'clock and
[22:42] brother
[22:43] Boyet and his house a lovely home and I
[22:48] tell you what I went into this bedroom I
[22:50] saw this lovely mattes all my own mom in
[22:53] heaven I you know so that's how it works
[22:55] you know
[22:56] Paul said I know how they are bind and I
[22:58] know how to be a bit a man and God knows
[23:00] but it would wonder wonderful time you
[23:02] know and if I may say this just a prison
[23:05] Lord there's so many things you could
[23:06] say ah you know in India when the police
[23:13] came and they left I I just addressed
[23:15] the church for a couple of moments and I
[23:17] said to the people then I said you know
[23:19] once again just like Vietnam my head is
[23:22] in the lion's mouth but the audacity of
[23:25] it all I said to them no I said for you
[23:29] people I'm gonna challenge the devil
[23:32] toe-to-toe I'm going to challenge the
[23:35] devil and I said to him if you can close
[23:38] your mouth closure and I'm with go ahead
[23:41] and you know something but I discovered
[23:43] butter deck he couldn't close his mind
[23:46] he couldn't stop down in my head and
[23:49] kill me off and get me into prison or
[23:51] get deported out of the country he could
[23:53] not do it amen
[23:55] but unfortunately I can say this much
[23:57] that when I get back to the airport the
[24:00] guy said well that was a whatever was he
[24:02] had in his computer he said that's a
[24:04] that's a big problem a big felony or
[24:08] whatever you think I've murdered
[24:09] somebody you know and so I don't know
[24:12] when we come to do the he stopped my
[24:14] passport out so there's no deportation
[24:16] but if that said that if that's in their
[24:19] computer it was a at the airport if it's
[24:21] in the computer in Dublin I might have a
[24:23] bit of trouble this year getting getting
[24:25] the visa but God's will be gone that's
[24:27] all I can say and then of course women
[24:30] were in the Philippines could I just
[24:32] tell you one story about the Philippines
[24:34] because we went up and we were going to
[24:36] a certain place and I said you know
[24:39] brother meinem I said I remember that
[24:43] the weddin he said yeah he said can you
[24:46] remember that I said yeah I said Pat
[24:48] Russell Suzie can you remember there
[24:50] mims I said of course yeah I can and he
[24:55] said yeah they've had a born child under
[24:58] money two years and she's expecting
[24:59] another child so that was wonderful
[25:02] but I said but you remember that wedding
[25:04] that the brother carried in a sister at
[25:06] the very end you just to give their
[25:07] greetings to the married couple and on
[25:10] her dress there was bloodstains you know
[25:12] and I thought what nurse I you know and
[25:15] just as I could see the tears that come
[25:18] on down and she wasn't in know and so
[25:21] I'm standing there at the side and just
[25:24] as they can by me again
[25:25] I can a more or less you know stop them
[25:28] and and I said do you mind if I pray for
[25:32] you and they said yes it's fine you know
[25:35] we prayed so the festivities went on he
[25:38] carried her right and they just lived
[25:40] across their little house it's just a
[25:42] little lien from the church and that's
[25:45] where they lived but we were up in
[25:46] another place and about three hours
[25:47] later we're leaving the village and I I
[25:52] walk and I walk behind the pastor going
[25:54] up to where the car was his SUV and I
[25:58] seen her she was in her garden sitting
[26:01] on a bed with her back to the wall
[26:03] so I said pastor pastor called them back
[26:05] and we open a little gate and went then
[26:07] and I looked at her and I said my I said
[26:10] you're looking much better and I and she
[26:12] smiled so I said well god bless you
[26:15] shook her hand and we drove off and that
[26:18] was that for two years that was that
[26:20] until this year we're driving up talking
[26:24] about these things and I said tell me I
[26:25] said whatever but whatever became of
[26:27] that woman you know I didn't even know
[26:30] her name
[26:30] and he said oh brother she was healed
[26:32] and I said wow that's wonderful that's
[26:35] wonderful
[26:36] I didn't even know that what job he said
[26:39] I might be talking to someone this
[26:41] morning he said she has diabetes that's
[26:43] what it was so shown for him wherever
[26:45] the blood comes right I do I don't know
[26:46] folks but that's what he said and so I
[26:49] said wow that's really wonderful and I
[26:52] said tell me and I said I don't mind
[26:55] I mean after Lilly takes insulin and
[26:57] needs insulin I'd say Amen whatever you
[27:00] failed to do you know but I said does
[27:02] she take insulin
[27:03] he said no
[27:04] she doesn't need it amen
[27:07] so so you know that was wonderful and
[27:11] then of course of course that lady she
[27:14] put me on the spot because I didn't know
[27:16] it but in the meeting that night she
[27:18] asked God that I would pray for her son
[27:20] and I didn't know she was good that I
[27:23] would pray for her son but in the
[27:25] meeting when people came out and would
[27:26] meet at the front you know my I just
[27:29] felt to pray for this platform to pull
[27:31] over so I just excuse me and I wonder
[27:33] where I said son I want to pray for you
[27:34] you know and I prayed for him and that
[27:36] was her answer to her that was her boy
[27:40] you know so thank God for leadership of
[27:43] the Holy Ghost amen
[27:44] and I will say this much that we did
[27:47] help a few pastors there and the main
[27:49] posture don't a grip he's doing a great
[27:51] job and he said brother I needed the
[27:55] engine needs to be really overhauled
[27:57] it's leaking oil and all kinds of things
[27:59] night and he said if you can help and I
[28:01] asked him how much it would be it was 12
[28:03] million rupiah amen
[28:06] I forget how many maybe 800 800
[28:11] well close to $1,000 I suppose just
[28:14] about there so thank God we were able to
[28:16] do these things and we can only do it
[28:18] because God's people has helped us
[28:20] that's all so we're so thankful and and
[28:23] amen
[28:24] certainly I said if I go back to that
[28:26] area and Bangkok I'll go down it's only
[28:28] been an hour 15 minutes to fly to
[28:30] Indonesia so we'll do it but anyway I'll
[28:34] leave it there I'm anybody has any
[28:36] questions ask him and I'll give you an
[28:38] answer because there's far more than
[28:39] that but all I want to turn to the Word
[28:41] of God it's 10:00 to 11:00 o'clock and
[28:43] could we just turn to the scripture
[28:46] please amen and we're going to read in
[28:50] Matthew it should come up here and I
[28:52] think it'll be fly stopped for you but
[28:53] if you've got your Bible with you yeah
[28:55] it says just just for a text says that
[28:58] when Jesus came into the coasts of
[29:00] Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[29:03] saying whom do men say that I the Son of
[29:07] Man um so he is the son of man and they
[29:10] said some say they were John the Baptist
[29:13] some Elias which is Elijah and some say
[29:16] Jeremiah's which is Jeremiah
[29:18] or one of the prophets and he said unto
[29:21] them but whom say ye that I am and that
[29:25] question console every one of us today
[29:27] it's not what the part is to you who do
[29:30] you say that he is see and so he says
[29:33] Pater
[29:34] and Simon Peter answered and said thou
[29:37] art the Christ
[29:38] now that's revelation the Son of the
[29:40] Living God and jesus answered and said
[29:42] unto him blessed art thou simon barjona
[29:45] for flesh and blood has not revealed it
[29:47] unto thee but my father which is in
[29:50] heaven and i say auntie zhou art Peter
[29:53] and upon this rock amen I will build my
[29:56] church and the gates of Hell will not
[29:59] prevail against it we'll take them down
[30:01] and I will give unto thee the keys of
[30:04] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[30:06] thou shalt bind shall be bound in heaven
[30:08] and whatsoever thou shalt loose shall be
[30:11] loosed on earth shall be loosed what you

[31:41] for some time so IIIi did it amen
[31:45] excuse me I did it and put these things
[31:48] together I at the home church under
[31:51] abundance of them you'll see that at a
[31:54] moment when I show you what I'm going to
[31:55] do but breathe inspirational truths you
[31:59] know it seems for me but the Baptist's
[32:02] have got a language the Church of God of
[32:04] God language law got a language that
[32:06] they speak in you know but the bride of
[32:09] Jesus Christ has got a language to
[32:11] praise the Lord and and you know our
[32:15] language amen when we speak the same
[32:18] language as brother branham a spiritual
[32:20] language amen but when we're quoting
[32:22] brother branham it might be strange to a
[32:25] Baptist but it's not strange to you or
[32:27] me you understand because that's what
[32:29] language is it signed sine waves and the
[32:32] sine waves that it is you understand
[32:34] what's being said and so praise the Lord
[32:37] over the years the quotes of brother
[32:40] Branham have left an indelible mark on
[32:43] our life an indelible mark on our life
[32:46] amen the richness of the spiritual
[32:48] meaning is so marvelous so wonderful
[32:51] hallelujah and it is inspirational
[32:54] that's why I call it grit and sprinkle
[32:56] trees because that word has inspired us
[32:59] hallelujah
[33:00] it's inspired us to this very point in
[33:02] time amen the truth that has blessed our
[33:05] souls and enriched us hallelujah
[33:08] especially in this dark are that we're
[33:10] living today amen praise God and we hear
[33:14] all kinds of things going on and nothing

[33:26] in America since you know well I'll tell
[33:29] us all good happen folks amen and I
[33:31] think brother Tong put it quite well
[33:33] other words to three men turn in

[33:37] Wow and you know what they're building
[33:39] on they're building on nothing their
[33:41] honor their own a bottomless pit and
[33:43] it's just falling falling falling
[33:45] amen but thank God for the word and
[33:48] thank God for where we are today because
[33:50] of the words and darkness but we are in
[33:52] Goshen we are in the inspirational light
[33:55] of the day and it will see us through
[33:57] and Botanica finished us I hope that God
[34:00] really blesses it to your heart amen
[34:03] you know that's what I want to do I
[34:06] wanted to put a few quotes together you
[34:09] will have your your own ones a little
[34:12] boy couldn't be any more about 13 he
[34:15] came to me when I spoke on this and he
[34:18] said there's something for you said I
[34:20] might not have got it right he said but
[34:22] ah brother Branham said something I
[34:24] guess he said the same faith that got
[34:26] you in a bed in the morning we'll see
[34:28] you in to the rapture so haha amen and
[34:31] that's not far away Amen praise God
[34:34] number way so hallelujah Amen under so
[34:37] many things you know I started off by
[34:39] just as they come into my mind and my
[34:42] heart and you know I'm not going to
[34:43] speak much on this but brother brother
[34:45] said I'd rather have the right spirit
[34:46] the right spirit and under on the wrong
[34:50] doctrine than have the wrong doctrine
[34:52] and the right spirit and that's truly
[34:54] man you can have the right spirit or the
[34:57] right doctrine but you have the wrong
[34:59] the wrong spirit you're not presented at
[35:01] the way that prophet presented it amen
[35:04] and so like you know and we may be
[35:06] touched
[35:06] later on we but have we made and so you
[35:09] know there's so many so many lovely
[35:11] quotes that we have you know when
[35:13] brother Branham said you know that not
[35:15] so types of spirit soul you need these
[35:17] things that we can relate to as I was
[35:19] telling the folks there this morning
[35:22] that it really told me where I was
[35:24] listening in the the car coming down
[35:26] yesterday when brother Branham testified
[35:28] it was over in California the first time
[35:30] he preached it in Jeffersonville but I
[35:33] meant today is this scripture fulfilled
[35:34] that he's just given a testimony and
[35:36] then that he said you know that he
[35:38] because he was on educated whatnot he
[35:40] had to go by types you know
[35:42] and he said it's like my hand you know I
[35:44] can go over here I'm putting my hand
[35:46] against the light there you'll see a
[35:48] shadow on the wall now if you could only
[35:51] see that shadow of my hand you would see
[35:53] five fingers so the shadow will tell you
[35:56] that I've got five fingers Amen you
[35:58] understand
[35:59] Masada will always tell you what's there
[36:01] amen the tape will always tell you
[36:03] what's there but that's the reality
[36:05] that's the hon that's only the shadow
[36:07] but it will tell you what is there it's
[36:09] not going to show up six fingers and
[36:11] learning show up five amen
[36:13] wonderful things 9 if I make one because
[36:15] the first real thing that that touched
[36:18] my heart was don't put a carnal
[36:22] interpretation on a spiritual revelation
[36:24] and you know what the world's filled of
[36:26] it today
[36:27] prison Lord men and women that used to
[36:29] walk in a message
[36:30] putting carnal interpretations their own
[36:33] thinking their own reasoning and blur
[36:35] bottom always said don't try to reason
[36:36] with the devil he'll reason you under
[36:38] the table
[36:39] amen Jesus never tried to reason with
[36:41] him you know no it seems reasonable it
[36:44] wouldn't do it praise God
[36:46] so hallelujah you don't put a carnal
[36:49] interpretation now you know when evil
[36:51] and the deaths
[36:53] there was no Bible in but my spirits are
[36:56] Revelation he seen it wasn't through its
[36:57] amen he's seen it was a life the
[37:00] separation of life so he went and got
[37:03] alarm and offered it amen by faith which
[37:06] which the bush the spiritual revelation
[37:09] of an amen see it was revealed to him
[37:12] that it wasn't an apple of woodland
[37:14] fruit see and this is all that this is
[37:16] all the course you'll find them if you
[37:17] look them up amen it was a separation of
[37:20] life he went and he got a life and
[37:22] offered it instead of fruits amen
[37:24] well it puts it lovely in the Hebrews in
[37:27] chapter 11 when verse 4 where it says by
[37:31] faith faith is a revelation amen
[37:34] it is a revelation and by faith Abel
[37:37] offered up a more excellent sacrifice
[37:40] hallelujah by which he obtained witness
[37:44] a holy ghost witness that he was
[37:48] righteous Amen then take a silver fella
[37:51] because I got too much here to dwell on
[37:52] it
[37:52] I just I'm gonna have two peaks amen
[37:55] that's the other fella he comes along
[37:56] and of course I here's key and he
[37:58] watched his nature I'm reading from
[38:00] brother Don of here and he comes along
[38:01] he's a shrewd businessman smart amen and
[38:04] challenge it were very religious yeah
[38:06] and watch this and so he comes along
[38:08] here in both the older because he knows
[38:10] God you need done over the worship God
[38:12] and
[38:13] he buzz at all and then he puts his
[38:15] fruit so that feel on it the officer to
[38:17] God and he says Lord I know we had
[38:20] apples and caused the fall and so here
[38:22] we are got my altar filled with the
[38:23] fruits and praise the Lord
[38:26] here he is you see and brother son and
[38:28] brother branham he says that this will
[38:30] bring atonement pretty good and under
[38:33] Buddhists believe that to the state
[38:34] that's what they offer I see it in
[38:36] Thailand all the time there's a revival
[38:38] of Buddhism in Thailand
[38:40] you know big huge statues of Buddha and
[38:42] people they're offering their little
[38:44] fruits you know well see but brother
[38:46] Branham says see what he was trying to
[38:48] do he was trying to put a carnal
[38:51] interpretation on a spiritual revelation
[38:54] and you you go up the wrong tree when
[38:57] you do that amen
[38:58] you see because by spiritual revelation
[39:00] Abel knew it was blood
[39:04] amen so when we come to that I'll come
[39:06] back a little bit later on
[39:08] interpretation if you don't mind but you
[39:10] know here was was was a Peter amen and
[39:14] who do you say that I am and you know
[39:17] the Catholic set was built on Peter the
[39:19] Protestant with building on Jesus amen
[39:21] and neither one Jesus didn't say he said
[39:25] blessed our diocese that that flesh and
[39:28] blood has not revealed it God Himself
[39:30] the father has revealed it on to you and
[39:33] he says on this I will build my church
[39:36] and of course amen he says that the
[39:38] gifts of gear hell will not prevail
[39:40] against it and so a spiritual revealed
[39:43] truth of Jesus being the Son of God
[39:46] that's what it was will not hit you
[39:49] that's what brought you to Christ when
[39:51] you realize that he is the Christ that
[39:54] you need him and that's what brought you
[39:56] the switch he's built a search on not
[39:58] not on tradition not on oh this is my
[40:00] grandson and he's saved not because I'm
[40:02] his grandfather or whatever can't say
[40:04] that every person has to find it
[40:06] themselves amen and so here was an
[40:09] ignorant Fisher man a man couldn't send
[40:11] his own name and press the Lord you know
[40:15] but please God without faith to make him
[40:17] Peter the little stone and he given the
[40:20] keys of the kingdom you see so it was on
[40:23] I it wasn't on the rock Peter
[40:26] say something on a second I want to get
[40:28] lastly but upon the spiritual revelation
[40:32] prison Lord this is what Jesus said amen
[40:34] and that's the rock the revelation and
[40:37] only God can give you that aim and
[40:39] you'll never get that in a book you'll
[40:41] never get it you'll get it when God
[40:42] shows you it I'm praise the Lord so amen
[40:46] here he was and that's what the Prophet
[40:49] said amen and you know he said the gifts
[40:52] of Hell will not prevail against I'm
[40:53] just going to read it another portion
[40:55] before I move on fastly but the gifts of
[40:57] Hell shall not prevail against it
[40:58] certainly they did not and they cannot
[41:01] hallelujah because he took captivity
[41:03] captive and he descended took the keys
[41:06] out of his hand amen so Prince the Lord
[41:09] he's disarmed him and he is Lord I so
[41:13] glad about that
[41:14] not just briefly they'll finish up in
[41:16] the session the Roman Catholics say the
[41:17] church is built upon Peter
[41:19] he said now doctors really carnal and it
[41:21] is folks and you know I don't know if
[41:23] you stream this or not but ER
[41:24] yeah but if you do and there's any
[41:26] Catholic people don't be offended
[41:27] because I'll tell you what
[41:29] amen I'm not preaching at you as a
[41:30] person but if you believe that that's
[41:33] really carnal to think that God would
[41:36] build his church on that system amen and
[41:39] I he said that is really because a man
[41:42] that was so unstable as Peter who denied
[41:45] the Lord and cursed him with those and
[41:47] cursing amen
[41:49] God can't build his church upon any man
[41:52] born in sin you see honest ASIMO's
[41:55] teaching that Mary is the mother of God
[41:58] that's very subtle you know certainly as
[42:01] Jesus amen
[42:02] was the Christ yes amen but my not the
[42:06] mother of God
[42:07] in other words he doesn't transcend him
[42:09] no sir she does not amen and another
[42:13] thing too that they just made a very a
[42:16] cool mediator with Christ so where does
[42:19] that get us hallelujah
[42:21] a cool mediator means that she's a high
[42:23] priestess well you might find that you
[42:26] may find out in Jezebel worship but you
[42:28] will not find it in the Bible because of
[42:30] that's in the Bible and that's in the
[42:33] Bible folks God has broke his own word
[42:35] there ain't no woman high priests in the
[42:37] Bible that's not a disrespect you
[42:40] there ain't no woman high priest in the
[42:42] Bible you've read it I read it it's not
[42:45] there not right
[42:46] so prison Lord it's just a carnal
[42:49] interpretation on a spiritual revelation
[42:52] but then you know a brother Branham says
[42:55] he says amen
[42:57] but he says it was a revelation read it
[43:00] the way it's written flesh and blood has
[43:03] not revealed it but my father is
[43:05] revealed it on upon this rock I will
[43:07] build my church amen the church is built
[43:10] on Revelation on thus saith the Lord
[43:13] hallelujah Amen well could I go on a
[43:16] little bit about that because you know
[43:18] with with Peter amen I hear he's
[43:20] standing there on the day of Pentecost
[43:23] and the Holy Ghost has fallen for the
[43:25] first time and Peters asked what can we
[43:28] do to be saved
[43:29] watch right now he's gonna stick one of
[43:31] the keys in the law hallelujah and I
[43:33] believe it with all my heart we've heard
[43:35] of this week as well but I believe it
[43:36] with all my heart and this light that
[43:38] you learn today there's a key to every
[43:41] situation you'll find yourself in
[43:44] there's a key I don't matter what hand
[43:47] opens the key prisons the key but there
[43:49] is a key and if you can find it you'll
[43:52] find the key to the door whatever
[43:54] situation you find yourself in I believe
[43:56] that with all my heart
[43:57] amen and thank you very much and so here
[44:00] he was praise the Lord
[44:01] no bourbon I'm said look ten days before
[44:04] that suede coat said he said hear he's
[44:06] listening to Jesus saying and blend all
[44:08] the world preach the gospel and whatever
[44:11] it was when the resurrection yes and he
[44:13] says preach and he said and baptize them
[44:15] in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost
[44:17] Peter heard that what is the layers so
[44:20] what's wrong here why is this man not
[44:22] going to baptize them in the name of the
[44:23] Father Son the Holy Ghost well the
[44:25] denominations can't understand that
[44:27] praise the Lord for they keep doing it
[44:29] you know they don't even have no
[44:30] spiritual revelation or not folks they
[44:33] don't amen because that's not an iam you
[44:36] know what I know what I'm not going to
[44:37] stay here that is titles what he said in
[44:40] the Miam and Peter had that spiritual
[44:42] revelation so they built all on carnal
[44:46] reveling a carnal knowledge of an amen
[44:49] they put a carnal interpretation on a
[44:51] spiritual
[44:53] evolution amen okay now I'm gonna close
[44:57] with us on this section now I'm gonna
[45:00] close my message you made me the thought
[45:02] of going the other not yet
[45:04] there you are spiritual revelation of
[45:06] the word about heart are you glad this
[45:08] morning you got spiritual revelation are
[45:10] you glad what you can see what you can
[45:12] see hallelujah
[45:13] that means God's revealed it to you and
[45:15] so Prince the Lord the spiritual
[45:18] revelation of the word of God those who
[45:20] are filled with the Holy Ghost heard the
[45:23] word they have the ears that him that
[45:26] has ears hear and they received it and
[45:29] they live by it those who did not have
[45:32] the spirit heard it only as a carnal man
[45:36] and I can go ended up in the Corinthians
[45:39] but I ain't got the time okay but you
[45:41] hear there's only is a carnal mind and
[45:43] what do you do you put a carnal
[45:45] interpretation on what you hear you
[45:46] think it all right it's all open your
[45:48] intellect oh yes and this is it but
[45:50] there is a way that seems right to a man
[45:52] but they ended up is the ways of death
[45:54] you got out with my revelation amen and
[45:57] when you do that as a carnal mind you
[46:01] will put a wrong interpretation on the
[46:03] Word of God and many are do or not they
[46:05] would step back from spiritual to carnal
[46:08] and they're going to come up with a
[46:10] carnal interpretation okay no could I
[46:13] move on praise the Lord you know this
[46:16] came to me just an order can I'm sure
[46:17] you've got your you know I know but I
[46:19] couldn't put all the the ones that I
[46:21] love I'm going to do more for the church
[46:22] whenever whenever the Holy Spirit moves
[46:24] me again I put another sexism together
[46:27] but these are the ones that came to me
[46:28] for this particular um these particular
[46:31] uh message here amen I do love that one
[46:34] that I love up with all my heart and a
[46:35] lotus in church kids Roberta Bonham says
[46:37] you know that the measure will do two
[46:39] things you have the spirit of Elijah
[46:40] amen
[46:42] and he will open the seals praise God
[46:44] and revealed the true that's mmm seems
[46:46] the seven thunders that send them and he
[46:48] says praise the Lord and he said when
[46:50] you believe that he said your heart has
[46:52] been literally turned back to the
[46:54] Pentecostal Father's will I'll tell you
[46:56] what we believe that did he don't think
[46:58] there's anybody here that doesn't
[46:59] believe that truth that's in themselves
[47:00] we believe it hallelujah and our hearts
[47:03] have been turned back it's okay
[47:05] no he said
[47:07] never major on a minor oh how many are
[47:11] doing that praise the Lord
[47:12] even some people I know in them they say
[47:15] they're in the message you know but
[47:17] actually they're they're kind of
[47:19] Pentecostals you know like brother
[47:20] brother said it's like a blackboard ping
[47:22] the south leg you know and you just you
[47:24] just you just watch them you just watch
[47:27] them on the fence you know and when he
[47:29] gets hungry and he thinks there's nobody
[47:30] looking he'll be darned on the old dead
[47:32] carcass you know okay but you never made
[47:36] you're on a miner you keep your balance
[47:38] in the scriptures and I'll tell you what
[47:40] brother Branham will keep your balance
[47:42] on the scriptures by what he said he'll
[47:44] do it folks amen you see look at baptism
[47:46] amen I remember my auntie told me there
[47:49] is no father or there is no Holy Ghost
[47:52] qingxue much since ah yeah why cuz she
[47:55] was oneness the Church of God there's
[47:57] Jesus only amen so then you go along and
[48:01] you're baptized in the name of Jesus
[48:02] only and that's not scriptural it's not
[48:05] scriptural it's the Lord Jesus Christ we
[48:07] know that that's the fool wonder in the
[48:09] original and in acts I'm so Prince the
[48:12] Lord then you've got your other
[48:13] denomination say father son Holy Ghost
[48:15] then you've got people wrong and too far
[48:17] with it and then and they haven't kept
[48:19] their balance and the scripture but God
[48:21] will always keep your balance in the
[48:23] scripture hallelujah amen
[48:25] and that's wonderful and you never made
[48:27] it on a minor you know the restoration
[48:29] of the gifts you know people when you
[48:31] spoke on tongues you've got it I often
[48:33] wondered about that you know means so it
[48:35] means that John Wesley don't think he
[48:37] ever spoken tongues didn't have the Holy
[48:39] Ghost I mean the messenger of me didn't
[48:41] have the Holy Ghost cuz he never spoke
[48:43] in tongues
[48:44] good old candy costal theology and it is
[48:47] hallelujah I know some of the churches
[48:49] got that on the front door you know and
[48:51] in the foyer says the initial evidence
[48:54] is the proof that you've got the Holy
[48:57] Ghost not speaking in tongues oh my my
[48:59] my
[49:00] you cannot major on a minor hallelujah
[49:03] praise the Lord that's a moose since he
[49:05] says and I believe in every one of them
[49:07] yet the Holy Ghost I watch this the Holy
[49:10] Ghost when you receive it as the person
[49:14] of Jesus Christ
[49:15] now we heard that mentioned yesterday I
[49:18] said this is what I quote this morning
[49:19] all right let me tell you this
[49:21] years ago I preached the message you in
[49:24] Christ and Christ in you now what is it
[49:27] you in Christ
[49:27] If any man be in Christ he is a new
[49:30] creation so how do you get into Christ
[49:33] well Jim brother Branham said it the
[49:35] Word of God says it because he's a word
[49:36] prophet he said by one spirit are you
[49:40] baptized in one body that's how you get
[49:42] into Christ by one spirit hallelujah
[49:44] amen
[49:45] then hardest Christ get into you well
[49:47] that all takes place amen
[49:49] but what Jesus said in revelation 3 he
[49:52] said if anyone hear my voice
[49:54] he said I will come in I will come in
[49:58] that is Christ in you the hope of glory
[50:01] so that's what the Holy Ghost is it's
[50:04] the person of Jesus Christ in here amen
[50:07] hallelujah so that is wonderful 9 amen
[50:10] ok you know we can speak in tongues he
[50:14] said I believe it I believe every bit of
[50:16] it praise the Lord sometimes I do it
[50:18] myself
[50:19] we went bird Charlie Spencer myself we
[50:21] went in to visit his brother and I is
[50:24] old man I in the home I'm that Charlie
[50:27] was praying for me started to speak in
[50:28] tongues I said that's nice amen
[50:31] but I wonder how much revelation of this
[50:32] message has they got you know that's
[50:34] just it and I wouldn't condemn it
[50:36] because I do it myself at times you know
[50:37] praise God but but you know something he
[50:39] said that's not it he said and we don't
[50:42] have the organizing the weapon amen the
[50:45] angel marking people you know weeping
[50:47] for the sins of the people
[50:49] amen he said and broke up he says God
[50:52] can never use just speaking in tongues
[50:55] you know like on prison Lord see you're
[50:57] majoring on a minor hallelujah he said
[51:00] we've left them in thing and gone
[51:01] secondary you see and you could never
[51:03] meet your no matter we knew that and and
[51:05] you can't make gifts you Rock salute who
[51:09] know you know look folks it's all on
[51:12] tape you know what happened what did
[51:14] Eliezer put on Rebecca
[51:17] he put the gifts on Rebecca she had them
[51:19] but she was more than the bridegroom
[51:21] that camel it wasn't a gift carrier it
[51:24] was a camel that shed watered and that's
[51:27] what brought her to Isaac and that's
[51:28] what her focus in her eyes was on her
[51:31] absolute the Word of God fulfilled amen
[51:35] so praise the Lord for that amen and I'm
[51:37] not I'm not tell you what don't you ever
[51:39] think I'd be against the gifts of God
[51:40] because I would never in a million years
[51:41] good because I know when I'm on that
[51:43] foreign country and not lying
[51:46] hallelujah I know I need the part of God
[51:48] sometimes I need a miracle sometimes I
[51:51] need a voice of prophecy whatever it may
[51:53] be
[51:53] amen a word of knowledge anything you're
[51:56] never going to say oh god I don't need
[51:58] that yes you do yes you do
[52:00] but everything in this place and a place
[52:02] for everything amen brother Branham said
[52:04] divine healing is not what we try to
[52:07] measure on the men healing that we're
[52:09] after is the soul Princeville he says
[52:12] the man are born again and how eternal
[52:15] life in shall never perish
[52:16] oh yes because there's the mindset you
[52:18] can get heals and get sick again where
[52:21] does that put you you can get healed and
[52:23] sick again after that amen but one day
[52:25] you will die if you live long enough in
[52:27] this earth you'll run it to your last
[52:28] day amen we all will see so he said
[52:31] don't don't make that a major don't
[52:33] major on a minor and he says that you
[52:36] know he said 86% of Jesus ministry was
[52:39] that but it was to catch the people's
[52:41] attention amen
[52:43] and so prison order you know I could
[52:45] tell you more about that trip to
[52:47] Indonesia you know but but you know

[53:24] little shack somewhere with a Guyana old
[53:27] dilapidated wait coats you know I'm a

[53:39] them some some money to carry them over
[53:41] that time and to pray for them praise
[53:43] the Lord and God would touch them and
[53:45] did touch them amen
[53:47] and so we were
[53:48] thankful for them things but we're not
[53:50] gonna meet her or not prison Lord never

[55:53] healing is in the plan of salvation I'm
[55:56] reading it right what he said say for he
[55:58] was wounded hallelujah for that day when
[56:01] whip them whip them to a frazzle Amen
[56:04] but I'll tell you what thank God he
[56:06] whipped them for me and I claim not amen
[56:08] so pretty Lord we stand on the Word of
[56:11] God they are not are obsolete the gifts
[56:13] but we thank them for him and we're not
[56:15] going to major on them
[56:17] no I praise the Lord because with your
[56:19] get to know the one and then you'll see
[56:21] what I mean praise the Lord
[56:22] so you don't worry brother said the
[56:23] right mental attitude twenty divine
[56:26] promise will bring it to pass okay so he
[56:29] said that night let me just speak about
[56:31] the Holy Spirit for a while okay see the
[56:33] Holy Spirit I love this you know prophet
[56:36] of God when he makes a statement and
[56:37] sublime you know he said the Holy Ghost
[56:41] in you will feed on the Word of God and
[56:44] you how do you think butter what does
[56:47] that mean the Holy Ghost to me now first
[56:49] of all you see amen
[56:52] he will feed on the word that's in you
[56:55] that word got to be in you first
[56:57] amen when you accept the word hallelujah
[56:59] not word is in you I'll just give it to
[57:01] you in a moment but he will feed on you
[57:03] now have you going to the Song of
[57:04] Solomon you'll get a good idea what I
[57:06] mean the north but I'll blow in the
[57:08] sight when I blow in and the bride says
[57:10] come into my garden a taste of your
[57:12] fruits hallelujah and the male come into
[57:15] my life come into my garden gist of your
[57:17] fruits what you've done for me you feel
[57:20] or not hallelujah and it pleases the
[57:22] Lord when we can do that amen so imagine
[57:26] the Holy Ghost feeding on the word
[57:28] that's in you today prison Lord and you
[57:31] know not only that but he says here
[57:35] they've long forgot it because they've
[57:38] classified the gift of the Holy Spirit
[57:40] as initial evidence of speaking in
[57:42] tongues he said I heard devils and
[57:44] witches speak in tongues now this is
[57:46] that now what this is going to help
[57:48] somebody here this morning he said the
[57:50] Holy Ghost as the word of God and you
[57:53] write this is what he says the Holy
[57:56] Ghost is the Word of God in Jesus a
[57:57] treaty amen that identifies itself
[58:00] aren't you glad everything you want you
[58:02] want to know everything the identify
[58:04] yourself who are you you know you know
[58:06] even young young Samuel didn't know not
[58:08] who are you Lord you know and he said
[58:10] the next time he speaks let him speak
[58:12] you know and the old man knew not Eli
[58:15] and so the Holy Ghost is the Word of God
[58:17] in you that identifies himself by
[58:22] accepting the word hey man that's how I
[58:25] identified he will accept the word
[58:27] so you're saying Amen this morning
[58:29] because you've accepted the word I'm the
[58:31] Holy Ghost as had done to find himself
[58:32] with you hallelujah is not wonderful
[58:35] this morning prison Ord and he said the
[58:38] prophecy said amen she excited that he
[58:42] said and can't be the Holy Ghost because
[58:44] the Holy Ghost will never deny this word
[58:46] I don't care who it is
[58:48] he'll not break it he'll fulfill it the
[58:50] promises but he will not deny it
[58:52] praise the Lord and say brother grant
[58:54] him you know and I he say he goes right
[58:58] back you know you could say anything to
[59:00] him amen
[59:01] but when you get read back and you say
[59:04] to him and what about the Ohio River
[59:07] what happened there he would never deny
[59:09] that he not straight brother with he
[59:11] always said that happened in the Ohio
[59:14] River that voice spoke is John and he
[59:17] would never you could tell him anything
[59:19] but he said no I'll never deny that not
[59:22] to really hoping a new higher river and
[59:24] so thank God you know it's like the
[59:27] devil may come to you and say hey who do
[59:29] you think you are you think you're see
[59:31] if you think you're a Christian you know
[59:32] I was there the night that Christ came
[59:34] into my heart a man I don't need a devil
[59:36] to tell me hallelujah praise God hey man
[59:40] is this as Ronald said he never talked
[59:43] me into it and he won't talk me out of
[59:44] it amen
[59:46] so prison Lord young so that's wonderful
[59:49] and that's the evidence he said what are
[59:51] you believe it or not the evidence when
[59:53] the Holy Ghost identifies the Word of
[59:55] God and you into your heart you've got
[59:57] that witness of the Holy Spirit that's a
[59:59] glorious thing to hell you know I just
[1:00:03] say that's very briefly because I've got
[1:00:04] such a lot here you know when I was

[1:16:45] said he said the first the first one is
[1:16:48] it must be his time
[1:16:51] thank you breathe he said it must be his
[1:16:54] time to do it so no matter what's
[1:16:57] happened in history you know we can go
[1:16:59] back to John Wesley's day I can take you
[1:17:01] not more than three miles from where I
[1:17:03] live it was I found it by accident and
[1:17:06] you go down this little village and
[1:17:09] there's a gift there's a kind of a
[1:17:10] gateway you could do that get follow a
[1:17:13] little trail not more than 100 yards and
[1:17:15] you come to a river and right there
[1:17:18] there was a wooden building and that's
[1:17:21] where John Wesley preached the Word of
[1:17:23] God not more than three miles from where
[1:17:26] I live hallelujah so but I can't go back
[1:17:29] there hallelujah that was his day that
[1:17:31] was his hour see but it must be God's
[1:17:34] time it was God's time for that no it's
[1:17:37] God's time for us hallelujah okay the
[1:17:39] second one is amen
[1:17:41] it must be according to his word that
[1:17:44] has been spoken
[1:17:45] you know the continuity of Scripture is
[1:17:48] wonderful God always does things in
[1:17:51] continuity amen and it must be according
[1:17:54] to the word that has been spoken for is
[1:17:56] the Lord it has to be in the word that's
[1:17:58] why it was called a word prophet praise
[1:18:00] God that's why it says behold I send you
[1:18:02] elijah hallelujah you know and the mind
[1:18:05] that said mr. brannom was wrong because
[1:18:08] if you look at Luke chapter 1 chapter 2
[1:18:10] John the Baptist is Elijah see carnal
[1:18:14] interpretation oh no spiritual
[1:18:16] revelation
[1:18:17] we know you know what the angel said to
[1:18:20] Zechariah until Elizabeth prison Lord
[1:18:22] that John would turn the hearts of the
[1:18:26] father's to the children he fulfilled
[1:18:29] not but I'll tell you what he didn't
[1:18:31] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:18:33] the fathers did he say to the man's
[1:18:35] wisdom he's listed
[1:18:37] he absolutely missed it okay no it must
[1:18:40] be according to his word I would say
[1:18:42] more than the second all right and third
[1:18:45] it must be according to the person he
[1:18:48] has chosen I tell you what
[1:18:51] no don't matter the denomination may put
[1:18:53] up a great intellectual guy many of them
[1:18:56] have done it you know and not man had
[1:18:58] come up that day he was so smart so
[1:19:00] educated this winter like so and he'd be
[1:19:02] got to tell these people what he knew my
[1:19:05] my what he knew and he'd come up all
[1:19:08] puffed up and prayed and eight realized
[1:19:12] the people aren't getting this and so
[1:19:16] when he finished he was so down that he
[1:19:20] closed his Bible and he walked down the
[1:19:22] jacket and the man said the brother
[1:19:25] branham he said and I have hija de one
[1:19:27] don't like that he would have come
[1:19:29] during the way he went up and not right
[1:19:32] certainly as hallelujah it must be
[1:19:34] according to the person God has chosen a
[1:19:38] man not - chosen God has chosen
[1:19:41] hallelujah and I gotta give you more
[1:19:43] than I amen and 48 must first come to

[1:24:31] Spirit of the Lord is upon me he saw his
[1:24:33] scripture John the Baptist saw his

[1:24:57] get the word it's not gonna you know
[1:24:59] like a engine you know I remember you
[1:25:03] could do I could do it I couldn't do it
[1:25:04] nigh on the modern cars but you know you
[1:25:07] could if you if you thought your engine
[1:25:09] just wasn't right you got a little light
[1:25:11] called a stroboscope and you turned on
[1:25:13] the engine and you'd made sure your
[1:25:15] fingers weren't anywhere near the fan
[1:25:17] belt and you send it on there and you
[1:25:20] could see because this late makes it as
[1:25:23] if it's not turning and those two little
[1:25:25] lights that right brother dick attitude
[1:25:27] lights and if you were right if you were
[1:25:29] not you see you could see the legs here
[1:25:30] when it should be here
[1:25:32] and that's true the school showed you
[1:25:34] that and so then you could adjust it
[1:25:36] until it was right and that means your
[1:25:38] pistons were all in perfect order you
[1:25:40] see so that's the way it has to be you
[1:25:42] don't want to dislocate it because it's
[1:25:44] not going to run right hey man praise
[1:25:45] the Lord you don't want to misplace it

[1:25:49] scripture for your day
[1:25:50] praise the Lord somebody says there's
[1:25:51] not going to be no rapture you say oh
[1:25:53] brother who's going to say that I know

[1:26:12] we'd never done it okay please I just
[1:26:14] want as fast as I can amen
[1:26:16] see so you know when brother Branham
[1:26:19] talked about the per the program of God

[1:26:33] there's one or two of us here got a
[1:26:35] little bitterness in our heart you know
[1:26:37] brother Branham said prayer Oh take that
[1:26:38] better inside prayer
[1:26:40] we'll take that bitterness out of your
[1:26:41] heart amen and you know another little
[1:26:44] thing this is just older then you know
[1:26:46] he said the way up this time
[1:26:48] oh yes well that's not the way the world
[1:26:50] the way is up they could use everybody's

[1:27:32] quickly because I want to wind her down
[1:27:34] on a whirlwind err dine but you know
