[0:02] foreign
[0:25] all right so
[0:27] um let's go back
[0:29] to John 19 verse 30.
[0:32] because that's really the scripture I
[0:33] want to focus on
[0:35] and and uh for those that are listening
[0:38] on and recording we just read John
[0:40] chapter 19.
[0:42] we're going to narrow down on that
[0:44] scripture it is finished where Jesus on
[0:46] the cross it probably wouldn't look like
[0:48] the worst time
[0:50] for all the disciples were wondering is
[0:53] this the culmination of Jesus of
[0:54] ministry and and there on the cross he
[0:58] said it is finished that fulfilled that
[1:01] that promise back there in the Garden of
[1:02] Eden when communion was broken
[1:05] between Adam and Eve and God made the
[1:08] promise I'll put enmity
[1:10] okay
[1:12] here we go yeah between
[1:16] the woman's seed and the serpentine okay
[1:19] and and there on that cross
[1:22] he was restoring communion back and he
[1:25] said it's finished the whole the work is
[1:27] complete that stone that came out of the
[1:30] mountain came and struck the image right
[1:32] there
[1:33] because all Satan's kingdom had been set
[1:36] up that that that that started in the
[1:39] Garden of Eden came down through cush
[1:40] and Nimrod all the Babylonian the the uh
[1:44] just continuing on down to uh all the
[1:48] way down to the present age the ten toes
[1:50] but there on the cross
[1:52] it was finished
[1:54] he he struck the image now now there's
[1:56] kind of a dilemma because the stone
[2:00] is The Headstone and the Cornerstone
[2:03] it's the bottom and the top of the
[2:05] pyramid right it strikes that when he
[2:08] they're on Calvary it's it struck the
[2:11] feet of the image and and finished it
[2:13] but yet there's something that has to be
[2:15] done
[2:15] there's something there's a process that
[2:18] has to take place and and that's kind of
[2:21] what I I want to talk about uh
[2:24] so let's let's just pray before we and
[2:26] then read the scripture again before we
[2:28] get into it
[2:29] the Lord Jesus we're just so thankful
[2:31] Lord for the opening of your word and
[2:32] for your grace to us Lord I pray God
[2:34] that you'll be with the service this
[2:35] morning the Lord Brother Wade and be
[2:37] with all the people Lord and help the
[2:39] Lord that this will not seem complicated
[2:42] Lord but that you open it to our hearts
[2:44] to see your great plan and purpose
[2:47] grant that Lord we pray in your name
[2:49] amen
[2:50] because you know this this really
[2:53] a lot of times the things like the seals
[2:56] and and all these things seem so
[2:59] complicated but remember brother and
[3:01] told the people when he was preaching
[3:03] the seals just continue on the same
[3:05] simple message the same simple message
[3:08] of justification sanctification baptism
[3:11] nor a ghost once you received the new
[3:13] birth then God continues anymore
[3:16] justification sanctification of Baptist
[3:19] and all goes and second Peter said being
[3:21] born again because he's bringing us into
[3:23] communion
[3:24] justification sanctification baptism the
[3:27] Holy Ghost and the Capstone that brings
[3:30] us into perfect communion where God has
[3:31] total control of Our Lives
[3:33] and he's demolishing he's tearing down
[3:36] the kingdom of Satan in our lives just
[3:39] as he will tear down the kingdom of
[3:41] Satan in the natural life because
[3:43] remember in the Garden of Eden the Earth
[3:45] was cursed he's got to reclaim back the
[3:48] Earth right he's got to cling back claim
[3:50] again this Earth he's got to take
[3:52] everything back so that everything can
[3:54] be restored back to communion with him
[3:56] right so now now when you look at this
[3:59] pyramid that's you can see the seals
[4:04] because what's the seven seal the end of
[4:06] all things
[4:06] and God looks at it says this my work is
[4:09] finished
[4:11] the the process has been complete
[4:14] the uh and what does this what does the
[4:16] seals reveal the seals reveal Christ
[4:19] Christ in his church Christ the whole
[4:23] the whole plan that when he would uh I'm
[4:27] gonna jump ahead we're gonna look at
[4:28] some quotes in a second but let's just
[4:30] look at this quote first because this is
[4:32] this kind of let's just dwell on this
[4:35] for a second
[4:36] and meditate on this
[4:39] that stone
[4:41] tears down
[4:43] Satan's kingdom
[4:45] and and then the message was one that's
[4:47] 1962 brother and said Satan will make
[4:49] you all kind of promises
[4:51] but he has nothing to give you because
[4:53] he don't have nothing
[4:55] you don't have no salvation
[4:57] what is Satan anything contrary to the
[5:00] word
[5:01] he doesn't have salvation he doesn't
[5:03] have life his kingdom is Darkness
[5:06] the end thereof is death
[5:09] darkness and death is Satan's kingdom
[5:12] program repeat it again this is good
[5:15] this is real important that's what we're
[5:17] talking about Baal and Meredith and Kush
[5:19] and Nimrod and all this stuff the Stone
[5:22] comes down to tear this apart to tear
[5:25] down everything in your life is contrary
[5:27] to God's word
[5:29] brother random repeat again what is
[5:31] Satan's kingdom anything contrary to the
[5:35] word of God now that's cutting but it's
[5:37] time for cutting see to Branch the tree
[5:39] if it's going to Bear must be pruned
[5:41] it's time anything contrary to the
[5:43] precepts of God the word of God is not
[5:45] God what is it what is sin righteousness
[5:47] perverted what is death life perverted
[5:51] what is the kingdom of Satan anything
[5:54] that's setting something to take the
[5:55] place of the word anything any teaching
[5:58] one word just one word you might believe
[6:02] every bit Eve believed every bit of it
[6:04] to that of it to that one word that one
[6:07] word is all she needed to disbelieve
[6:09] that one word is all you need to
[6:11] disbelieve
[6:13] now meditate on this
[6:16] because this is why God had to send a
[6:18] prophet in this day
[6:19] to get us back to where we we believe
[6:22] all of God's work we don't look at God's
[6:25] word and say well
[6:26] I'm not 100 sure about the serpentine
[6:28] right or is that son of man really
[6:30] correct is the all the seals really
[6:33] opened I really need anything addition
[6:35] to what the prophet brought is there is
[6:38] there uh is maybe my church's teaching
[6:41] right the denominational idea
[6:43] but but God brings us back into perfect
[6:46] communion with him by the by the opening
[6:49] word through a prophet that brought us
[6:54] brought us everything that was hidden in
[6:56] the Mountain of God
[6:58] from before the foundation of the world
[7:02] that's that's kind of getting a little
[7:04] bit deep but just hang on
[7:07] and the guys little room said the holy
[7:09] spirit always speaks to the word I got
[7:11] many things to tell you you cannot
[7:12] understand it now but when he comes
[7:14] he'll guide you to it that's the reason
[7:16] the coming of the seals at the finishing
[7:17] of the seventh seal the mystery of God
[7:20] should be finished
[7:21] to know who God Is Right what he is
[7:25] how he lives his nature his being
[7:30] now see there on the cross
[7:33] and Jesus finished it
[7:35] but now for you to take advantage of it
[7:37] you have to accept what he did right and
[7:41] the the recipe is repent can be baptized
[7:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[7:45] the promise is to you
[7:47] so then when that Stone comes into your
[7:49] heart by the new birth
[7:52] then he begins to tear down the kingdom
[7:55] of Satan in your life that's right and
[7:58] it grows and grows like like all the
[8:00] little Parables that Jesus taught the
[8:03] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a woman
[8:05] that he had three measures uh the hit 11
[8:08] and three major per meal
[8:09] and it began to grow and grow and it
[8:12] takes over
[8:13] because that stone is growing into a
[8:16] mountain until you are perfectly
[8:19] inconvenient with God's word and he has
[8:21] total control
[8:22] does everybody understand amen so yeah
[8:26] this is so simple it's so
[8:30] and and that's what really the the seals
[8:33] are the seals open up the you know I
[8:37] remember Dale talking about brother
[8:40] random was talking about the seventh
[8:41] seal and it seemed like he spent too
[8:44] much so much time talking about his own
[8:46] life
[8:47] because he could look back and see what
[8:50] God had done in his own life how God had
[8:53] brought him through all these things up
[8:55] this stature
[8:57] until he can look back and see the seals
[8:59] being broke see what God had done how
[9:01] God
[9:04] had Justified him and saved him and
[9:06] taken him from a vessel Of Dishonor into
[9:09] a vessel of Honor
[9:15] so now
[9:17] I hope it's clear what Lisa's speaking
[9:19] of Jeremiah 52 declarity among the
[9:22] Nations and published and set up a
[9:23] standard publish and conceal lot
[9:28] say Babylon is tinking
[9:31] Kingdom of Satan in your life
[9:34] Veil a confounder and I just put that
[9:38] note because Bill means the confounder
[9:40] the confounder is confounded
[9:43] Meredith the rebel is broken in pieces
[9:47] remember he had a he had the club to
[9:50] break in pieces
[9:52] her Idols are confounding
[9:54] her images are broken in pieces and that
[9:57] same language is used in Daniel chapter
[9:59] 2.
[10:00] thou saws till the stone was cut out
[10:03] without hands which smote the image upon
[10:06] his feet that were of iron and clay and
[10:08] break them to pieces
[10:10] why was the stone cut out with hands
[10:12] because it had nothing to do with man's
[10:15] ideas
[10:16] Jesus was not put into Mary's womb By
[10:19] Any Man man-made intervention that man
[10:22] had nothing to do with Jesus birth
[10:25] and man has nothing to do with the new
[10:28] birth it's something that God does and
[10:30] this statue of a perfect man is not
[10:32] something that you do by works it's God
[10:35] doing it it's a stone that was cut
[10:37] without hands to make you in the image
[10:40] of the mountain
[10:42] of of the uh of the great Eternal God
[10:46] so that he's building a church
[10:48] In His Image remember the Bible says
[10:51] that that Jesus was in the express image
[10:54] of the father
[10:55] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[10:58] silver and the gold broke into pieces
[11:01] together
[11:01] and became like the chaff of the summer
[11:05] and the wind carried them away that no
[11:08] place was found for them
[11:10] no place is found in your life when this
[11:13] process is complete for the devil
[11:17] it's blown away Blown Away by the word
[11:21] of God Blown Away by the spirit
[11:24] going away by what he's done
[11:26] and the stone that smoothie image became
[11:29] a great mountain and filled the whole
[11:32] Earth
[11:34] does that make sense that's so simple
[11:36] it's so so profound and so deep at the
[11:40] same time
[11:41] remember the ruble was throughout the
[11:43] school which the types Christ he said
[11:45] despise not the day of simple things
[11:47] because this is It's really
[11:50] it's really not complicated
[11:54] in the future home of the Heavenly
[11:56] bridegroom and the Earthly bride in 1964
[11:57] Daniel saw the same thing a rock struck
[12:00] the world
[12:01] was heed out without hands and the whole
[12:03] image of the systems was broke down and
[12:05] become like shat chaff on the summer
[12:07] threshing floor
[12:09] and the wind packed it away
[12:11] and The Rock itself grew into a great
[12:13] Mountain the cover of the earth watch
[12:14] that mountain down a little bit that
[12:15] mountain to cover the Earth
[12:17] and then see he switches he's talking
[12:19] about you
[12:20] you're the same man and stature that you
[12:22] was when God called you same woman but
[12:25] you see what it did it was a
[12:27] regeneration
[12:28] the old life passed away
[12:31] the old desires passed away
[12:33] when you used to like to drink and cuss
[12:35] and fuss and stew and run around anymore
[12:37] that thing just died see but now you are
[12:40] used then it was God's instrument now
[12:43] you are redeemed
[12:46] see it's finished when you get the new
[12:48] birth
[12:50] but yet there's a process that you have
[12:52] to go through the Cornerstone and the
[12:56] headstone
[12:57] and when the Capstone comes it signifies
[13:00] that the price of God has accepted you
[13:02] you're you're in the image of the father
[13:05] the process
[13:07] is complete Redemption for you is
[13:10] complete
[13:14] so let's go back and look at those three
[13:15] things the number I wanted to do
[13:19] you want to build a strong nation which
[13:21] he did
[13:21] in other words he wanted to set up a
[13:23] kingdom
[13:25] he wanted to propagate his own religion
[13:27] which he did
[13:29] now see the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:31] when that Stone comes into your life
[13:33] that's not a religion it's not doing
[13:35] things just to satisfy a rule book but
[13:38] it's it's uh it's a lie it's the Life of
[13:41] Christ lived out in you
[13:44] he wanted to make a name for himself
[13:46] which he also accomplished
[13:49] now a real Christian doesn't want a name
[13:51] for themselves they want to take on his
[13:52] name right you're a real Christian oh
[13:56] Christian because you act like Christ
[13:58] the life Christ is made manifest in you
[14:01] that's why we don't we don't pray in
[14:03] Jesus name that's not just tacking words
[14:05] on the end of your prayer but it's
[14:08] signifying that the Life of Christ is
[14:10] living inside of you right and it's made
[14:12] manifest and you have taken on his name
[14:15] his power is dwelling inside of you
[14:19] so those three things compare with what
[14:21] what God wanted to do in his church
[14:28] now this is real comedian
[14:31] Christ The Mystery of God reveals 1963
[14:34] . now notice again now what's his
[14:36] threefold purpose manifest itself in
[14:38] Jesus Christ
[14:41] to come into the body by Jesus Christ to
[14:44] have the preeminances to what
[14:47] restore backing bring that like bring
[14:50] back that which was lost
[14:52] that was the only thing out of order all
[14:54] the rest of his things was in order
[15:00] there's his threefold purpose to make
[15:03] himself manifest in Jesus Christ
[15:06] to make him himself manifest in the
[15:08] church
[15:10] and that see that's why that pyramid
[15:12] represents Christ
[15:14] the church
[15:15] and the New Jerusalem that City that
[15:18] came out from God out of Heaven the
[15:21] pyramid completeness restoration store
[15:24] back eat and bring back that which was
[15:26] lost
[15:29] who can condemn me of sin he said in
[15:31] Christ The Mystery of God I reveal if I
[15:33] do not the works of the father then
[15:34] where have I where have I felt now you
[15:36] fellas say that you're doing that you
[15:38] denomination now show me yeah show me
[15:40] where I fail to be the Messiah that's uh
[15:42] show where I fell on one sign that God
[15:44] said the Messiah would do that I have a
[15:46] feel that he said God in his body he's
[15:50] talking about
[15:51] say God in his body of Christ
[15:54] God in his body of church
[15:57] fulfilling his uh remembering Christ The
[16:00] Mystery of God revealed he read
[16:01] Colossians chapter one got down to verse
[16:03] 26-27 the mystery of God that Christ
[16:06] would be revealed in US
[16:09] this mystery that's hidden down from all
[16:11] the ages
[16:13] yes good question so
[16:17] you're saying that but of course the
[16:20] Cornerstone
[16:21] yes and of course if that Foundation is
[16:24] Jesus yes you start with Jesus the end
[16:27] of Jesus exactly the Capstone yes
[16:29] exactly I want to make sure that's what
[16:31] you were saying for that science really
[16:33] good I liked exactly so when the process
[16:37] is finished now now that's what brother
[16:38] Brandon kept focusing on
[16:40] you cannot get arrested
[16:43] between the the uh
[16:46] the I forget what you call these stones
[16:48] that cover over the pyramid that
[16:50] covering stones that a lot of them have
[16:52] had been stolen and whatnot but if they
[16:55] were still there you could they say you
[16:57] could see that pyramid light up at night
[16:59] or or during the day the sun would
[17:01] reflect off that pyramid it would just
[17:03] shine like a beacon
[17:04] and you couldn't get a razor blade
[17:06] between between your revelation of God's
[17:10] word and his word you could it just just
[17:13] dovetail exactly that all the way up
[17:17] you're in perfect communion
[17:19] that's how we have Community with one
[17:22] another
[17:22] how you can imagine the confusion if you
[17:25] have in the church if you have a lot of
[17:27] the ministers that aren't don't see eye
[17:29] to eye that just creates confusion but
[17:31] when everything's inconvenient and we're
[17:33] all working together and that's why you
[17:36] know brother random kept focusing look
[17:37] at the the how the Nicolaitans approach
[17:40] it where the the people don't really
[17:42] have anything to do with it it's it's
[17:44] all to the ministry you know the the
[17:46] whole church is supposed to be Spirit
[17:49] led the whole church is supposed to be
[17:52] in communion with God right because the
[17:54] whole church makes up this pyramid
[17:56] that's right and each individual
[17:58] remember in the Statue of perfect man he
[17:59] says the way the church is built up is
[18:02] the way the individual is built up
[18:05] dark
[18:06] with it is finished right and then when
[18:10] it is finished now that's kind of a
[18:13] confusing thing
[18:15] uh maybe we'll look at some scriptures
[18:18] that that are a little bit you know
[18:21] maybe used to be a little bit seem a
[18:24] little bit odd that you know that God
[18:26] will be all in all that everything's
[18:28] under his feet but it's not all we've
[18:31] got to wait a little bit for everything
[18:32] to be under his feet
[18:34] laughs
[18:36] so
[18:41] there's a famine in the land for God's
[18:43] word how do we get how do we get up to
[18:45] the to the uh how do we mature in this
[18:49] statue of perfect man so you see I'm
[18:51] kind of getting on both the latest topic
[18:53] a little bit because all these things oh
[18:55] you know we even overlap it's not
[18:56] separate separate topics the seals and
[18:59] Daniel 70 weeks and the staff's perfect
[19:01] man but it's all interwoven it's all
[19:03] really one topic that God is building up
[19:05] his church he's making a masterpiece and
[19:09] this is the Masterpiece amen and in the
[19:11] Old Testament there was a famine in the
[19:13] land and this is called the famine Steel
[19:16] and this tells about
[19:18] let me look at my notes Here
[19:21] uh
[19:23] Pharaoh Joker
[19:25] wrote that he was in distress on the
[19:28] great throne
[19:30] and he asked
[19:31] uh he asked his his advisor I asked him
[19:35] who was the Chamberlain Chamberlain M
[19:37] Hotel the son of Todd tah was the god
[19:40] that created all the other gods in the
[19:43] Egyptian mythology
[19:44] he was the head God the Creator
[19:49] so he this Pharaoh had a chief advisor
[19:52] that he asked for help when there was a
[19:55] famine in the land
[19:57] what is the perfect he asked him what is
[19:59] the birthplace of the Nile who's the god
[20:01] there he was the god in motel answered
[20:03] on you the guidance of him who presides
[20:06] over the family name
[20:07] I need some help let me go ask God
[20:11] I'm talking about
[20:14] when the King slept you see the the
[20:17] story is a little bit a little bit
[20:19] distorted to make the king look good
[20:22] when the King slept the Nile God knew
[20:24] revealed himself to him in a dream and
[20:26] promised the Nile pour forth for our
[20:28] Waters so this is a story of seven years
[20:30] of family
[20:31] in seven years of cleaning
[20:33] and it's written here about Frank Road
[20:35] Joseph and and his chief advisor in
[20:38] hotel and and if you kind of study um
[20:42] you can kind of compare Joseph and him
[20:44] Hotel Joseph was the second in command
[20:47] in the Pharaoh and hotel was the second
[20:48] command they both lived to be 110 both
[20:52] with great architecture Builder both
[20:54] stored up corns during seven years of
[20:56] plenty both saw seven years of family
[20:58] and fed people they both were
[20:59] interpreters of greens
[21:01] um uh Joseph's name was zafnaf panel
[21:04] which means the mouth the mouth of God
[21:06] and uh
[21:08] the God speaks and he lives the man who
[21:11] to whom Mysteries are revealed and M
[21:14] Hotel means the mouth of him which
[21:16] everybody says uh you know there's no
[21:18] there was no God named him
[21:20] but what if that was the mouth of I am
[21:24] and he is they're both instituted income
[21:27] tax of one-fifth they're both married in
[21:29] the priesthood of all they both had a
[21:31] knowledge of astrology
[21:33] um they both were educated people they
[21:34] both oversaw Public Works they both had
[21:36] a legendary history that continued on
[21:38] down uh Joseph is still taught up today
[21:41] him Hotel was a legendary man that was
[21:44] became worshiped uh for his for his
[21:47] wisdom and and uh and so forth
[21:51] um
[21:52] Joseph means um
[21:54] uh M Hotel means the one who comes in
[21:57] peace and Joseph means to add increase
[21:58] to join or gather together and they both
[22:01] were one of 12 siblings so that's
[22:03] interesting coincidence very interesting
[22:06] now in that time the the way the way to
[22:10] get uh they had to come to Joseph to
[22:14] receive to receive the the food
[22:20] and this day you got to to grow up this
[22:23] jacket or a perfect man the point I'm
[22:24] trying to make is you got to you got to
[22:26] dig into the word yourself you got to
[22:28] open it up and and what they did and now
[22:31] there's a quote brother and said these
[22:33] Mysteries that were hidden in the
[22:34] Mountain of God and I think it's
[22:36] interesting that that to come to get
[22:39] corn they went to a place where there
[22:41] was a pyramid you know this is this is
[22:43] the city of Sakara where they found uh
[22:46] they think this is where Joseph built
[22:47] this this whole complex
[22:49] where they they gave the food they
[22:53] stored up they had these huge pits in
[22:55] the ground where they stored grain and
[22:57] they even found grain in it today
[23:00] so to come to get spiritual food you go
[23:03] to the mountain you go to the they would
[23:05] go to this place where a pyramid was set
[23:07] up to receive Food just to kind of look
[23:10] at this and imagine Joseph's brothers
[23:12] coming up to meet him and everything to
[23:14] to uh going through that whole story
[23:18] um but you know
[23:21] God has made a way for us through this
[23:25] prophet's message to receive in in a
[23:28] spiritual family where the there's a
[23:31] famine in the land of the word God has
[23:33] given us the ability to reap so I just
[23:36] want to I'm just kind of bringing this
[23:37] up to as an encouragement to dig into
[23:39] the word and see if these things are
[23:41] true
[23:42] because
[23:46] that's just such a type that we're going
[23:50] to the mountain the mountain of the Lord
[23:51] and I I was reading through all these um
[23:55] these these uh dreams there was like six
[23:57] dreams that that different people had
[23:59] before
[24:01] um the cloud before the seventh seal and
[24:03] they were all speaking of going to the
[24:05] mountain you know brother Brown uh
[24:07] brother Junior Jackson had a dream where
[24:09] he took the Crowbar and opened up uh he
[24:12] saw brother Branham going into the
[24:14] mountain and and taking out Mysteries
[24:16] and things and and these these Mysteries
[24:19] are hidden in the mountain that's right
[24:22] and and back then they went
[24:25] maybe traveling by Campbell for miles
[24:27] around to see this mountain this pyramid
[24:30] sticking up
[24:31] so they went to get to get this corn
[24:35] to get their food
[24:39] he built this whole complex where
[24:41] there's there's a little uh
[24:43] places under the city and just a little
[24:45] uh where you could go underground and
[24:47] get corn and whatnot yeah who's that is
[24:54] I see what he said in the greatest
[24:56] battle ever fall
[24:59] they had this dream where uh some some
[25:02] brothers were trying to follow along
[25:04] they wanted to kind of live the same
[25:06] life he did and and The Boatman told him
[25:09] but what you need to do is lay up
[25:12] provision so they they'll stay behind
[25:14] and just just just eat and he said I was
[25:17] just ordering all kinds of cabbages and
[25:19] turnips and radishes and things pile
[25:20] them in there like that then I woke up
[25:23] and and read a few paragraphs down now
[25:25] this is what I'm saying this morning is
[25:27] storing food storing food so that you'll
[25:29] have something to eat so that you'll
[25:31] have something to Feast upon get it on
[25:33] your tapes set in the cool of the room
[25:36] now this is what really what I've been
[25:38] talking about if you get in communion if
[25:40] you don't understand what's being priest
[25:41] upstairs you don't understand on the
[25:43] tapes get on get on the in the cool of
[25:46] the room make sure you open it up and
[25:47] meditate on it and think about it and
[25:49] pray set in the cool because that's
[25:51] really what convenient is it's a
[25:53] communion between you and God communion
[25:55] with his word set in the cool of the
[25:58] room maybe when I'm a long ways away
[25:59] you'll still remember these things are
[26:01] true sit in your room and listen see and
[26:04] this is food storing in in the
[26:06] storehouse
[26:09] what's up
[26:12] and there's the quote The Mystery of the
[26:15] Seven Seals that was sealed up on the
[26:16] inside of that mountain of the Lord
[26:19] now this is the dream that Junior
[26:21] Jackson had
[26:23] let's go ahead and read that and then
[26:25] we'll maybe stop on this
[26:27] remember Judy Jackson's dream that time
[26:29] we went out there Judy dreamed that he
[26:31] saw this how many remembers of the dream
[26:32] and how the lord gave the interpretation
[26:34] that great Mountain we were standing
[26:35] upon it an old washed out letters there
[26:37] and I was trying to interpret it and I
[26:39] couldn't do it and I was interpreting it
[26:41] to him after I got it all interpreted
[26:42] all the interpreted then I reached over
[26:44] and got in his dream house some kind of
[26:46] like a bar and just cut the top of the
[26:48] mountain off and looked in there and it
[26:50] was all snow-like like marble but it
[26:52] wasn't written on and I said you all
[26:53] stay here and look in on this now well
[26:55] I'll go Yonder and Juni all of them went
[26:58] up and all the brothers and all looking
[26:59] in on it another they couldn't
[27:00] understand said well what do you know
[27:03] it's not even written here but yet he
[27:05] was reading the outside of it why isn't
[27:07] it written in here we can't understand
[27:08] and Junior turned around and looked and
[27:11] he seen me going towards the West
[27:12] towards the city of the Sun going over
[27:14] at one mountain Another Mountain real
[27:16] fast just getting and then he turned
[27:18] around and looked and seen me going a
[27:20] whole big group of them took off that
[27:21] way
[27:22] and they want to go this and do after
[27:24] that and do that after I told them to
[27:26] stay there stay there stay right there
[27:29] right here this is the place
[27:31] and then when I did that then and I went
[27:33] just exactly a little bit after that the
[27:35] angel of the Lord appeared to me to say
[27:36] go out to Arizona Yonder I heard that
[27:39] blast go off and went there and what was
[27:40] it that boy dreamed that dream just
[27:42] exactly right and the lord gave the
[27:44] right remember I said there's something
[27:46] I'm going there for and when I went
[27:48] there it was the mystery of the Seven
[27:49] Seals that was sealed up on the inside
[27:51] of the mountain of the Lord
[27:54] and and there's another quote where you
[27:56] said people they told them to stay right
[27:58] there and meditate on it and some went
[27:59] this way somewhere there but there's
[28:00] going to be a few people that will stay
[28:03] right with this
[28:04] and stay with it until you come into
[28:07] communion
[28:09] perfect communion
[28:10] and we'll just we'll just stop right
[28:12] there
[28:22] foreign
