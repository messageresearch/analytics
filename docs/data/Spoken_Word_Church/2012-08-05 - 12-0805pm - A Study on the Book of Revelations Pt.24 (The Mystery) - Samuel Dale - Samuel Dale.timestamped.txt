[5:08] of Revelations and what is the Book of
[5:10] Revelations is a revelation of Jesus
[5:12] Christ am so that's what we're why we
[5:14] keep reading verse one the revelation of
[5:18] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[5:20] show unto his servants things which must
[5:22] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[5:25] signified it by his Angel un to his
[5:27] servant John who be record of the word
[5:29] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[5:32] Christ and of all things that he saw so
[5:34] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[5:36] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[5:39] those things which are written therein
[5:41] for the time is at hand First Peter 1
[5:47] ver9 receiving the end of your faith
[5:49] even the salvation of your Souls which
[5:52] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[5:54] searched diligently who prophesied of
[5:56] the grace that should come unto you
[5:59] search searching what or what manner of
[6:01] time the spirit of Christ which was in
[6:03] them did signify when it before when it
[6:06] testified beforeand the sufferings of
[6:08] Christ and the glory see not just
[6:11] showing his crucifixion but showing the
[6:13] glory that should follow unto whom it
[6:16] was revealed that not unto themselves
[6:19] but unto us they did Minister the things
[6:21] which are now reported unto you by them
[6:24] that have preached the gospel unto you
[6:26] with the Holy Ghost sent down from from
[6:29] Heaven which things that Angels desired
[6:32] to look into desire to look into
[6:35] wherefore G up the loins of your mind
[6:36] and be sober and hope to the end for the
[6:39] grace see right Grace amen that's right
[6:43] Grace is unmerited favor amen God
[6:46] promised it thank you we'll take it amen
[6:49] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[6:51] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[6:53] right you may be seated the Lord in his
[6:55] Blessing the reading of word I chose to
[6:58] give you the quotes you know for
[7:01] everybody
[7:02] personally those that are on the
[7:04] internet can pull them off and read them
[7:07] but I chose to give you these to where
[7:10] that you would uh you know say well we
[7:13] can sit down and read and think on these
[7:17] things even though we have seen them on
[7:19] the screen we can take them home with us
[7:22] and ponder over it now I pray this
[7:26] afternoon that you will listen
[7:29] attentively to what I've tried to say
[7:32] and the Lord has given me maybe a a way
[7:36] to express it and you
[7:39] know I'm a funny person I I'm a firm
[7:44] believer
[7:45] in God and his ways of doing and uh you
[7:49] know if it took a fishing trip to
[7:53] understand how to present something well
[7:54] then I can enjoy the fishing trip and
[7:57] have a good time and then I come back
[8:00] doubly loaded because I come back with
[8:04] God speaking to me and I'm not the
[8:06] person I'm sorry I've never been and
[8:08] I've never tried to hide it I'm not a
[8:11] prayer Warrior I'm not you know that a
[8:14] lot of people call them I'm not one that
[8:17] uh does a lot of things like people will
[8:20] say and do I have spent my entire life
[8:23] studying the Bible and studying the
[8:26] message and now the benefits I read from
[8:29] that is sometimes even though I have got
[8:34] older and getting more forgetful and I
[8:36] realize that you know that that wees out
[8:39] with you but still it's amazing
[8:42] sometimes when you get by yourself and
[8:44] thinking that the Lord can just drop
[8:47] down and talk to you and you don't spend
[8:49] a week or two talking to you though
[8:52] that's what everybody thinks you know
[8:54] they say I talked with the Lord the
[8:55] other day and he talked with me for
[8:57] three or four hours well I'm not saying
[8:59] it didn't now forgive me don't think I
[9:02] am I'm just saying when he speaks to me
[9:06] it's in just a short word that's right
[9:08] that's it that's right and then I come
[9:11] here in 3 months I try to preach it yeah
[9:14] but you know uh so he did it is a vast
[9:17] thing but I I you know I just made
[9:20] different to be that I guess and
[9:22] everybody's made the way they supposed
[9:24] to be so forgive me just bear with me
[9:27] and just pray for me all right but now
[9:29] we covered we've been covering up to and
[9:33] gotten up now to which we will start on
[9:36] in a little
[9:37] while on verse 8 of the fifth
[9:42] chapter and try to you know look into
[9:46] something I spoke to you about it this
[9:49] morning you know at the end of the
[9:51] service but now we're going to deal with
[9:53] it and try to express something to you
[9:57] and uh you know
[10:01] the main thing that I've tried
[10:03] to get you to
[10:06] see
[10:10] is you know I spent entire Services
[10:14] trying to express to you right that the
[10:18] book must be
[10:21] completed before the lamb takes to bre
[10:26] right you know that would be like
[10:31] taking half the Bible if you you know
[10:32] you just right if you didn't do it that
[10:35] way see you'd just be taking half the
[10:37] Bible and say well the other part's not
[10:38] important no it is very very
[10:42] important and the Bible is in perfect
[10:45] order amen now I know I got into a
[10:49] discussion with some brothers years ago
[10:51] about some things and and all of them
[10:54] seem to have the idea or thought that
[10:56] the Book of Revelations was not in what
[10:59] you would call it chronological
[11:01] order but I differ with that I did then
[11:05] and I do now I believe it's laid out
[11:07] perfectly in order amen it is the word
[11:11] of God it is not something that you have
[11:14] to shuffle the cards to get them to come
[11:17] back around you know and jump from here
[11:20] to there to leave it you're going to
[11:23] leave a gap you're going to leave an
[11:27] understanding and I've emphasize over
[11:29] and over and will again today that the
[11:32] prophet say the fifth chapter is a
[11:34] preparation for the opening right of the
[11:39] Seven Seals right and he said if we
[11:41] don't get to preparation
[11:43] correct look where we miss it and like I
[11:46] emphasize this morning John was
[11:49] specially
[11:51] chosen to go to patmas Y right I wasn't
[11:56] you wasn't Paul wasn't Peter wasn't
[12:00] nobody else was chosen but John cuz it
[12:02] meant something that he would be the one
[12:05] that be in the prophetic realm of line
[12:08] that he would even in his writings of
[12:10] the Book of John you know before going
[12:14] to pmas that when he would come back he
[12:17] would have that ability even still in
[12:20] you know instilled in him he was the
[12:21] only one that called it the
[12:24] Antichrist Paul called it Grievous
[12:26] wolves Etc John went there and saw it
[12:28] right so we come back calling it The
[12:30] Antichrist the only time in the Little
[12:31] John's there and see after all was said
[12:34] and done look what John wound up doing
[12:36] he just come down to in and brother R
[12:38] said he would just come old man and said
[12:41] he' just sit around and say little
[12:43] children love one
[12:45] another why he had seen the Apex
[12:51] height you know of love right he had
[12:55] seen and was revealed to him the things
[12:58] that would happen on
[13:00] Earth but the main thing was not see it
[13:03] would be nice to to be able to get
[13:07] something in advance but you might be
[13:09] like the guy was that I remember an old
[13:11] movie maybe some of you remember that
[13:14] way on back in I seen it and I remember
[13:16] it that a guy was getting a newspaper a
[13:19] day ahead of everybody you probably saw
[13:21] that and remember it and see he could go
[13:24] out and bet on the horse races he could
[13:26] he could buy stock he could just do
[13:28] everything because he was ahead of
[13:30] everybody and he was doing wonderful
[13:32] until they happened to read in the
[13:34] bituary that he died the day before so
[13:38] you know that's the kind of what most
[13:41] people want to know right my emphasis
[13:44] not a joke of that see most people want
[13:47] to know what's going to happen right
[13:50] sure uh who's going to be
[13:52] president uh who's going to be this
[13:54] what's going to happen here what's going
[13:55] to be there see and that's more
[13:58] interesting to them because you see
[14:00] their emphasis is upon
[14:03] uh events right that are transpired or
[14:08] something you know and and and you know
[14:11] but I don't believe John was interested
[14:13] in that I don't believe the joy that he
[14:16] had in his heart come from being able to
[14:18] know what would happen down through time
[14:21] right he was
[14:23] overjoyed in the understanding of the
[14:26] revelation of Jesus Christ amen that was
[14:29] made known to him while he was on patas
[14:32] and all the Journey of Christ down
[14:34] Through the Ages that would come out and
[14:37] be all the way through the Bible and see
[14:39] everything you know and in doing that
[14:42] that was why he would be rejoicing it's
[14:44] in the fifth chapter here we get down to
[14:46] it you know he said every creature in
[14:48] heaven every creature on earth heard him
[14:51] not he heard them they heard him
[14:54] screaming Glory Hallelujah now right
[14:56] back up above there these angels and and
[14:59] Elders is shouting so much until Heaven
[15:02] is just filled well you know what about
[15:04] all of this you know that you can have
[15:06] this a great hola you know going on uh a
[15:09] great benefit going on and just
[15:12] everything going so loud and all at once
[15:14] over the top of ever been that you could
[15:16] just hear
[15:18] somebody just a holler Glory Hallelujah
[15:21] yeah I see Jesus amen cuz I've never
[15:25] tried to get you to see nothing else
[15:27] right amen
[15:29] that's right that's but see Jesus all
[15:32] right and when you see him brother said
[15:34] when you see him begin to see the word
[15:36] you seeing
[15:37] Christ he said if you read the Bible and
[15:40] don't see Christ in every verse right go
[15:43] back and read it again so I believe we
[15:45] need to put everything in
[15:48] order and then we can understand it we
[15:51] can follow it right down the line to
[15:53] where everything is been but just
[15:55] remember
[15:57] now
[15:59] and see to anybody listening please give
[16:02] me the benefit of being a human uh I
[16:04] don't know how to express a lot of
[16:06] things
[16:07] but see the book has to be
[16:11] completed and the book it it if the lamb
[16:15] left The Mercy Seat he's going to leave
[16:17] The Mercy Seat as quick as the quick as
[16:19] the book is finished right you know
[16:21] there going to be a short period of time
[16:23] he's going to leave the mercy seat right
[16:25] when the book is finished and all the
[16:26] names that we spoke of this morning all
[16:28] right and then see Redemption would be
[16:31] over right well if it was 2,000 years
[16:35] ago see all right it was
[16:39] over but then we bring it down if said
[16:41] no no it was
[16:42] 1963 is when the lamb well then
[16:45] Redemption was over in 63 right Y and
[16:48] most of all of us are lost right see so
[16:52] we know that's not true that's not the
[16:55] understanding right in the opening of
[16:58] the the seals as a vast difference
[17:00] between opening and the Gentile
[17:03] dispensation by the holy spirit being
[17:06] able to by the prophet messenger the
[17:09] seals to be open that we could
[17:11] understand what has been what is and
[17:13] what will be right and still it not even
[17:16] be happened in reality right
[17:20] amen yeah you
[17:23] know we know what's going to be the
[17:26] future home right amen sure what is a
[17:28] future home
[17:30] here right you you got over a thousand
[17:34] years before it can get here right
[17:37] amen but see we say we it was revealed
[17:41] remember nothing else the seals are
[17:43] revealed to the bride
[17:47] right but youd know for a shorty like
[17:50] the the for seal armag again and the
[17:52] fifth seals the fifth seal Jun you know
[17:55] that things we get into and The Sixth
[17:57] Seal be in the tri ation You' know
[18:00] that's not to us
[18:04] no but you see it seems have been so
[18:07] hard to try to express and to look at
[18:10] these and try to get people to realize
[18:12] what's taking place right but just get
[18:15] to a point you don't have to have all
[18:17] the background the the uh you know just
[18:20] leave it and just say well let Lord just
[18:22] help me to understand what that old
[18:24] guy's trying to say cuz he's been at it
[18:26] a long time right and I guess he's got
[18:28] so
[18:29] SE that's all he can do is just talk
[18:32] about the seals and the opening of the
[18:34] word and the revealing of Jesus Christ
[18:37] you know and so it is forgive me if all
[18:40] I can do is like John is just say love
[18:42] everybody you know and leave it alone
[18:44] and let me be that way but see the book
[18:47] has got to be completed yes that's right
[18:51] before he can take the book
[18:55] yes and if we are part of the book
[18:59] amen as we tried to emphasize the of the
[19:02] Prophet
[19:05] saying
[19:08] then is redemption
[19:13] over see if you're believing for your
[19:15] children for your grandchildren your
[19:16] husband your wife you know
[19:20] Etc you sure wouldn't want me to come
[19:22] out here and tell it's over with right
[19:25] you know wouldn't that be something
[19:26] wouldn't we all be happy
[19:30] that's
[19:31] stupid boy bless God God tells me
[19:35] something I just go tell you God told me
[19:38] something years ago and you've heard me
[19:40] say it that I could do something right
[19:43] here at this
[19:44] church anytime I got
[19:47] ready and for 20 years I haven't got
[19:50] ready
[19:51] yet you don't understand when God tells
[19:54] you
[19:56] something God tell me to do I just going
[19:58] to do it yeah that could wind up being
[20:02] like the Old Testament prophets were too
[20:05] right brother R said what about knowing
[20:10] this I'm according him we said trying to
[20:15] get it to the
[20:17] people see an Old Testament Prophet just
[20:19] go out and said that's it for go back to
[20:21] the Wilderness but your Prophet had to
[20:23] stay here with us and grind it out
[20:25] that's right and try to get us to see it
[20:27] knowing and just like when he come to
[20:28] the seventh seal he said it's gone from
[20:31] you that's before he even preached the
[20:33] seventh seal that's only the the
[20:35] questions and aners that he knew it was
[20:38] gone from the people now that's his
[20:40] words right
[20:42] amen see some people say well I don't
[20:45] know where he said well go read the book
[20:47] yeah I try to give you the page numbers
[20:49] and the things of
[20:51] it go read amen I ain't got time to read
[20:54] a few book just find one quote now you
[20:57] got enough time to be Sisty and ncy
[20:59] about all the rest of it yeah but listen
[21:03] Church listen to what I'm talking
[21:07] about this Bible as we covered this
[21:10] morning there's two parts to it right
[21:14] one part is The Book of Life the L book
[21:16] of life that your name was put there
[21:18] before the foundation of the world or it
[21:20] never will be put
[21:22] there the other part is the letters of
[21:25] these pages that tells of the lives
[21:28] that you and I are living upon Earth
[21:30] amen right so it's two parts to one book
[21:35] right all right see then this has to be
[21:40] completed all
[21:42] right before you can seal it up
[21:46] right and I was trying to illustrate
[21:49] with the the people of Israel going into
[21:51] captivity you know and their doings and
[21:54] and and they would seal up those things
[21:56] in their Earthly vessel and hide them
[21:58] well how would you like it if we run out
[22:01] of time of getting in there and brother
[22:03] Gary there was only a third of what you
[22:06] really supposed to get was wrote down on
[22:08] a piece of paper the rest of it was in
[22:10] your pocket cuz you hadn't got to you
[22:12] know to give it to him yet so when you
[22:14] come back you only going to get that
[22:15] third
[22:17] right y see that's not the way it
[22:20] is God is waiting for it to be sealed up
[22:24] amen and he's waiting it to be finished
[22:27] before it can be sealed amen
[22:29] now you said well if that's true then
[22:32] Brother D what about
[22:34] 144,000 that's not sealed up until they
[22:36] come here and live right that's right
[22:38] but we're not concerned with them right
[22:41] we're concerned with the Gentile
[22:42] dispensation right but it's made known
[22:45] to us what would take place right the
[22:48] opening of the seals was the revealing
[22:50] of Jesus Christ all the way through the
[22:52] Bible amen not to De section it in but
[22:56] all the way through the Bible that's why
[22:58] the Propet said it become a brand new
[23:00] book yeah that's right look at him he
[23:03] always preach that Jesus was almighty
[23:05] God right he'd always
[23:08] preached one true and living God Amen
[23:11] but then when the seals broke he
[23:12] preached Christ is the mystery of God
[23:17] revealed go in the Hebrew series and you
[23:19] got message after message of telling
[23:23] you about
[23:26] melz but then when the seals broke he
[23:29] preached the message who
[23:32] is present tense this
[23:35] mes see it become a new book to him am I
[23:39] heard a man that used to look gains for
[23:41] years ago and he'd been in the message
[23:42] about two months probably hadn't even
[23:44] never finished the seal book might not
[23:46] have read any of it but he said boy them
[23:48] seals broke brand new
[23:55] book how many of you even ever read the

[24:43] about the
[24:44] money but you know one of these days I
[24:46] might come around and say Hey you owe
[24:51] me all that you say you know just joking
[24:56] all right it don't matter to me that's
[24:59] right I just always tried to help people
[25:01] amen that's why today I could be a
[25:03] multimillionaire if I give it all away
[25:05] but I've enjoyed giving it away that's
[25:08] right and I don't regret giving anybody
[25:10] right I've always told you I'd buy a
[25:12] millionaire a meal this is quick as I
[25:14] buy a poper and you say well that's
[25:15] silly no it's not cuz I just made that I
[25:18] just don't care right but
[25:23] listen when the book is totally finished
[25:27] of our dispensation of
[25:29] time right in us the
[25:32] Gentiles then this book can be revealed
[25:35] to Israel right that's right and if it's
[25:38] not completed and sealed
[25:41] up there won't be anything to go to
[25:44] Israel
[25:47] right they can't read the
[25:50] book come on
[25:54] folks their eyes are blinded the Bible
[25:57] says amen that's right until this day it
[26:00] says amen that their heart is sealed
[26:04] right away from
[26:07] God but said one day it will turn you
[26:10] see all Israel is not going to be turned
[26:13] that's right it's not the nation of
[26:14] Israel that's going to be saved only
[26:17] 144,000 going to come out of
[26:19] Israel to be saved
[26:23] right but you see they're waiting on you
[26:25] and I to get out of the way
[26:28] that's right but the main thing they're
[26:30] waiting on you and I is to finish this
[26:32] book right
[26:34] amen and the finish our part of the
[26:38] book so where as John was specially
[26:40] chosen we are specially chosen to finish
[26:44] this situation if that don't give you a
[26:46] thrill in your heart then there's
[26:48] something wrong with your heart just the
[26:49] best way to say
[26:52] it but we covered it this morning I'll
[26:55] give it back because reason I do this a
[26:56] lot folks forgive me
[26:58] is those on the internet don't see all
[27:01] you see right so I have to sometimes put
[27:04] back on so go ahead pull up number one
[27:07] brother Anderson and it's the same thing
[27:10] as this morning we were talking about
[27:12] but I want the people out there to see
[27:15] it number one which is prph 74 the
[27:20] evening messenger there you
[27:23] go this 1963 this is just a little bit
[27:26] prior to the opening of seals
[27:28] he's talking about we find out the
[27:30] church ages in Revelations 10 there is
[27:32] to be a trumpet Revelations Church ages
[27:35] and over in Revelation 10 there's to be
[27:37] a trumpet down and there was seven
[27:39] voices there you know uttered they were
[27:42] not permitted to
[27:44] write but it was sealed on the backside
[27:47] of the book The Seven Seals was on the
[27:51] backs side of the book after the book is
[27:56] written now when what's the book
[28:01] written if we are as I gave this morning
[28:03] part of the mystery the prophet said
[28:05] Christ a mystery
[28:07] then the book can't be complete until
[28:10] we're sealed
[28:13] in because I said everybody's dealing
[28:15] with opening of books why don't you deal
[28:17] first with seeing how it got sealed
[28:19] right it can only be seal after it's
[28:22] written right
[28:24] amen they don't not take a great big
[28:26] light bug turned up
[28:28] that ought to be sensible am you know
[28:31] all right and in doing it now when the
[28:34] life one comes
[28:36] in then he can take the book but what he
[28:39] do what does he do first he seals it up
[28:42] right why we read this morning the holy
[28:46] spirit is the seal amen right the Bible
[28:50] says you're
[28:51] sealed until the day of redemption
[28:55] amen when the last one receives the
[28:57] baptism of the Holy
[29:00] Spirit sealed into the body amen there
[29:04] is to
[29:06] come a
[29:08] headstone amen which is
[29:13] love and that's going to seal us all in
[29:19] together then when we're sealed
[29:24] in it'll be a short Ministry yeah your
[29:28] Prophet said they would right after the
[29:31] door of the Gentile church is closed I
[29:32] will ano a church or God will ano a
[29:34] church that he doing one year what
[29:36] theologist tried to do in 2000 said he's
[29:38] doing it
[29:41] now why cuz he's sealing Us in the body
[29:43] of Christ now but one day he'll seal Us
[29:46] in by the holy spirit
[29:48] amen did not the prophet say to break a
[29:51] seal is to lose a Ministry
[29:55] amen right all right see we need these
[30:03] things according to the
[30:07] Bible and according to what we've read
[30:09] and proved this morning the book must be
[30:12] completed before it's sealed right all
[30:15] right now if you don't believe that one
[30:17] then you go back and you come down and
[30:21] we will just read verse one I mean verse
[30:24] 8 of chapter 5 and when he had taken the
[30:31] book The Four 20 Elders they fell down
[30:34] to worship right he couldn't take the
[30:38] book until it was
[30:40] completed so he's waiting on you amen
[30:43] that's right he's waiting on I to find
[30:45] that place Y and then he can move on the
[30:50] scene what do you mean he been years
[30:53] over okay
[30:56] sorry when Redemption is over the lamb
[30:59] can take the book break the
[31:06] seals and redeem every name that is in
[31:10] that book amen you remember the book
[31:13] we're talking about this morning that's
[31:15] the book of names yes right only names
[31:17] are written on the Lance Book of Life
[31:20] right but the book of life is a record
[31:22] of your natural life right all right and
[31:26] number two go ahead brother Anderson
[31:28] just bringing these back to
[31:31] you this is in the breach he said this
[31:33] book is sealed and you are sealed with
[31:36] the book until the day of redemption
[31:39] amen the book is sealed and you're
[31:41] sealed with the
[31:43] book we gave you from Christ The Mystery
[31:45] of God
[31:47] revealed where brother Brandon said that
[31:49] she's part of the
[31:52] mystery remember this morning it's on
[31:54] your notes there go on the screen for
[31:56] the others
[31:59] see then you and
[32:00] I is I was trying to wind down this
[32:04] morning you and
[32:06] I must
[32:10] become the word right not just talk
[32:13] about it right and it's not that we are
[32:17] to just give birth to the word remember
[32:20] Mary gave birth to the word right amen
[32:24] but your Prophet said see Mary is not
[32:28] the seed right he wouldn't saying she
[32:31] wouldn't have got
[32:34] right that's right he said so is it with
[32:37] Luther Wesley and Pentecost am he said
[32:40] they were carriers right why because
[32:43] none of those stages of the wheat little
[32:46] don't look like original right then the
[32:48] stock or the corn or whatever it don't
[32:51] look like the original you know what it
[32:53] looks like the original it's not even
[32:55] when you can take the corn and eat it
[32:56] green remember expl when you take that
[32:59] corn and you can take that corn and
[33:02] shook it off and put it in the ground
[33:05] and it'll grow now you know you don't
[33:07] put it in the ground until it gets
[33:08] really good and dry because it's going
[33:11] to
[33:12] rot all right going to rot on you and
[33:16] that's what most people have done so
[33:18] they come up with all these
[33:20] doctrines trying to make a Rapture take
[33:23] place and I'm not throwing off on never
[33:26] I
[33:28] never can you say that brother Dale has
[33:30] showed off on anybody for being in eror
[33:33] right because without the grace of God
[33:36] we would be the same right amen I don't
[33:40] care how goody goody you think you are
[33:43] right you're not Beyond Satan we were
[33:45] talking about that last night you know
[33:47] that that Gabriel couldn't even handle
[33:49] the
[33:50] devil when he was trying to come to
[33:52] Daniel right 21 days yeah the Bible
[33:58] says but he said Christ came to his Aid
[34:01] we see the devil couldn't handle
[34:03] Christ you know Michael amen he just
[34:06] couldn't handle him why because Michael
[34:08] was God Amen Gabriel was an angel
[34:12] remember right yes the devil was the
[34:14] anointed Sheriff that Stood Beside the
[34:15] Lord top Angel y that's that's right
[34:18] that's why Gabriel couldn't handle him
[34:20] right but Michael was God
[34:24] Amen Christ they could step on on the
[34:27] scene I want Michael on my side I love
[34:29] that song in Jamaica you know Michael on
[34:31] your side they sing it a lot huh but now
[34:34] think about
[34:36] it see then you and I must become the
[34:39] message amen the prophet said and I
[34:41] didn't bring some of these and just
[34:43] bringing it from the
[34:44] head but he said on birth pain he said I
[34:47] believe it's the right one where he said
[34:48] that the bride must give birth to
[34:50] Malachi
[34:53] 4 right brother R said we got to
[34:55] vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[34:59] Revelations 10:7 now I'm quoting him
[35:02] right you mean brother Dale you think we
[35:05] got to vindicate God vindicate that
[35:08] through the
[35:09] prophet now he was the one that said we
[35:11] had to
[35:13] right he didn't say I done it all that's
[35:17] right he said there's something for you
[35:20] to do yeah that's right you know what
[35:22] vindicate
[35:24] means to establish something in to an
[35:27] order that cannot be questioned is that
[35:35] Vindicated can we actually say that
[35:38] we're sealed into that message enough
[35:41] until they can't be programers
[35:47] right well that's what a lot of people
[35:49] was doing you said oh no not doing that
[35:51] well they already they leaving this
[35:52] message and going back to the world
[35:54] going back to denominations and
[35:55] everything else right
[35:58] and the worst part of it is most of them
[36:00] are staying in the message already
[36:02] deprogrammed cuz they bring in so much
[36:04] false Doctrine amen all right but that's
[36:06] got to be here there must need be heres
[36:08] among you that they that are approved
[36:10] may be made manifest it's beneficial
[36:12] that somebody cross you that's right
[36:15] it'll make you think that's true it'll
[36:18] make you study that's
[36:20] right you I like what brother George
[36:23] Canada told a man one time something
[36:25] that was in the Bible and I think it
[36:27] water baptism not certain but anyhow he
[36:29] told a man he said go read the book and
[36:31] find it show me different the old man
[36:34] come back and he said did you find
[36:35] anything in there contary he said no but
[36:38] I found a lot of other good things so at
[36:40] least that's a good point you know we
[36:43] ought to be able to find some good
[36:45] things somewhere right all
[36:49] right so then when this book is
[36:54] completed you and I think
[36:57] finished then God can
[37:01] take not us over there physically no
[37:05] right but he can go over there and tell
[37:08] through two prophets that there was a
[37:12] bride in the Gentile dispensation
[37:17] amen and they took the word and they
[37:20] held the word and is it spoken word
[37:23] Original Seed he told Abraham he said
[37:26] you held that seed or maybe it was S I
[37:28] forgot which way brother stes it but
[37:30] said you held that seed in long enough
[37:32] right
[37:34] amen it's time for birth that's right
[37:37] amen we've talked about the message long
[37:39] enough that's right amen it's time to
[37:42] walk that's right Amen in the
[37:46] word see then after the Rapture of the
[37:50] church after the Rapture of the church
[37:53] now God won't take the see we got you
[37:56] got to get out of here before you go to
[37:58] Israel amen right
[38:02] right and see then when we get out of
[38:05] here he can go there but what's he going
[38:07] to
[38:08] take he going to take the
[38:11] Bible right
[38:13] right how many is them two prophets
[38:16] going to come up with a new
[38:18] version good news for Modern
[38:21] Man or are they going to take this
[38:24] Bible y where are they going to get
[38:27] their message from
[38:32] amen well they'll just get it fresh from
[38:34] God and bless God and go out did Brother
[38:36] brandom get it where did he get
[38:41] it out of the book right amen that's
[38:45] right come on those two prophets will
[38:48] take this Bible and they'll go to
[38:52] Israel and they'll
[38:54] say according to this book
[38:57] you turned down your right of sunship
[39:00] right and rejected Jesus
[39:03] Christ
[39:05] now you are in the tribulation because
[39:08] of that that's right and you must give
[39:10] your
[39:13] life that's right for this
[39:17] message would you'll be put there in a
[39:20] position of being Unix to the bride
[39:22] servants for the bride y you'll get to
[39:25] be close to her you can see
[39:30] her but you won't be part of
[39:35] it isn't it odd in her
[39:40] story
[39:43] that a man named
[39:46] Joseph one time was sold by
[39:50] his
[39:52] brothers right right right what put him
[39:56] into
[39:57] slavery yeah because he had already made
[40:01] them mad at him for telling that they
[40:03] were going to have to bow down before
[40:05] him that even his mother and father now
[40:08] I don't remember where his mother was
[40:09] still living but his father was I
[40:13] know but he was s down to Egypt you
[40:16] remember the
[40:17] story and while he was in
[40:23] Egypt and his brothers out there
[40:25] wandering around
[40:28] y he was given a gentile bride right
[40:34] amen from that Gentile
[40:42] bride he would come
[40:44] forth you know with
[40:47] her now when he begins to reveal himself
[40:50] to his
[40:53] brothers remember M the bride went over
[40:56] into
[40:59] the temple somewhere or the place or
[41:02] what you going to call
[41:03] it she wasn't there y she was removed
[41:10] from being with him
[41:13] yeah all right now I'm trying to get you
[41:15] to this holy
[41:18] story
[41:19] okay so the brothers come and they they
[41:22] go through the whole thing of all of
[41:24] knowing and don't know him and then they
[41:26] finally get to wind up to kny him and
[41:29] little Benjamin is there and brought
[41:30] around and said there's your typ of
[41:32] 144,000 right amen cuz see the other
[41:35] brothers just represented Israel right
[41:37] right right he said a little Benjamin
[41:38] said that's top you
[41:40] 144,000 all
[41:42] right but see his brothers
[41:45] came the wife was still in
[41:49] the Away From Him He makes himself known
[41:53] to his
[41:55] brothers but you know what I'll bet you
[41:57] the next meal they ate I know who was
[42:01] steing for side of
[42:05] Joseph he was very proud of that little
[42:09] wife
[42:13] sure don't you think the next time they
[42:16] ate together it wasn't just Israel even
[42:20] though his daddy was
[42:23] there he loved his daddy and he loved
[42:25] little
[42:28] Benjamin but he led that
[42:33] wife she was a part of
[42:36] him right all
[42:38] right and being a part of him there she
[42:42] set right with
[42:45] him we know that Pharaoh was in charge
[42:49] cuz the father was always in charge
[42:51] right not trinary in but Joseph was
[42:55] second in command as we call
[42:58] it and there said his wife beside of him
[43:03] Y and Israel could see his
[43:06] wife he was very
[43:09] proud
[43:13] okay but it wasn't that she was off
[43:16] somewhere else and flirting around and
[43:17] flopping around and
[43:19] doing right she was his wife
[43:24] y see
[43:26] then he can make himself known to his
[43:31] brothers but you know even though he
[43:34] would Pi Benjamin out of it as a great
[43:39] honor Benjamin and Joseph you remember
[43:42] the only two that was of the sons of
[43:44] whoel retel
[43:48] okay but
[43:50] he he was proud of his wife
[43:54] mm he he wanted them to see his wife
[43:59] y he thought more of his
[44:03] wife than he thought of his
[44:06] brothers he thought more of his wife
[44:08] than he did Joseph I mean excuse
[44:11] Benjamin that would be the honor of his
[44:15] heart he thought more of his wife than
[44:17] he did his
[44:21] father never left his wife went to his
[44:24] father right you can Bank on that that's
[44:26] why I said you better believe the first
[44:28] big banquet they had she was sitting
[44:32] right there with
[44:34] him there's a lot to the story going on
[44:37] through there but I just want to get
[44:38] that point in your
[44:39] mind and if you watch that story you saw
[44:42] exactly what I ended up saying this
[44:46] morning but this book that we
[44:48] are is completed
[44:51] yep sealed
[44:54] up
[44:57] by the Holy
[44:58] Spirit then he can
[45:01] take this
[45:04] Bible and go to Israel through two
[45:08] prophets and tell them the whole story
[45:11] of
[45:14] Joseph and how they missed it that's
[45:17] right that's right and why they would
[45:19] not be able
[45:21] to sit beside him
[45:24] amen even his daddy could not take the
[45:28] place of his wife
[45:32] right because even in the visions and
[45:35] things it wasn't his wife he never saw
[45:38] his wife bowing before him but he even
[45:41] saw his mother his father and all of his
[45:45] Brethren had to Bow before him his wife
[45:48] never
[45:49] bowed she didn't have
[45:52] to you there's a little bride when we
[45:56] become the word amen we we thought we
[46:00] was the word when we become the revealed
[46:04] word amen that's right we're not the
[46:06] word called we read it off the page
[46:09] right that's right it's when we can live
[46:11] it in
[46:15] reality
[46:18] right then something can take place
[46:22] that's
[46:23] right see he wanted his father and his
[46:26] brothers to see his
[46:31] wife Lord willing Tuesday 54
[46:38] years that's my
[46:44] wife I love you I love my family but a
[46:49] man asked me one day he said you've
[46:51] heard me tell it said if you had to make
[46:54] a decision between your family dying or
[46:56] your wife dying said what would you do I
[46:59] said my family be
[47:01] gone my wife is part of
[47:04] me he said I wouldn't do that and it
[47:06] proved but
[47:08] still that's how close we are as one
[47:12] right all right he's very proud of his
[47:14] little bride he wants to show
[47:17] her brother R said just for a moment
[47:21] he'll show his bride to the world now
[47:25] that's a d right
[47:26] quote Amen brother not going to show it
[47:29] out here that the whole world is going
[47:31] to look up and see it no no no
[47:35] no those a rain right all Egypt never
[47:40] saw this what was going on only the ones
[47:43] that were chosen to be around when the
[47:45] wife was introduced that's right so you
[47:48] see the story yes M when we become the
[47:52] word yes God will have something to take
[47:55] to Israel right amen
[47:57] right and brother brandom I'll give it
[48:00] to you over and over and
[48:02] over where he says page 8 or paragraph
[48:05] 80 the Revelation chapter 5 I think that
[48:09] was what numberers
[48:11] that should be number four brother but
[48:13] it may not be MH right all right number
[48:16] four pull it up we've seen this one over
[48:19] and over and over but let's read one
[48:21] more
[48:23] time Revelation 5
[48:27] 1961 now he's preparing for the opening
[48:29] of those Seven Seals of redemption
[48:32] amen see that's what the fifth chapter
[48:37] is now take it out and say it's not
[48:40] important say it's out of
[48:42] order well we just bypass
[48:47] that we we don't need to know
[48:50] that brother mo one time we were talking
[48:52] to a brother he said I preached 72 hours
[48:57] on the Statue of perfect man brother
[49:00] said I ain't got 72 hours to listen to
[49:04] that he did so you another brother said
[49:08] what do you mean I preached it in an
[49:10] hour and a half
[49:12] yeah I'm not joking that happen but look
[49:17] see
[49:18] look the opening of those seven sealed
[49:20] red that's what the fifth chapter is
[49:22] that's the reason I kind of read it and
[49:24] then just take it from there and talk on
[49:26] it and give the other parts of the
[49:27] scripture is because it isn't verse by
[49:30] verse something that's happening it's
[49:32] not
[49:34] that it's preparing for something to
[49:40] happen if you get the
[49:42] preparation then youve just you're ready
[49:45] for it then it's all by faith y now how
[49:51] many times have we read that
[49:53] quote it's not a verse by verse but we
[49:56] must read it verse by verse he was
[49:57] reading it verse by verse expressing it
[49:59] what does he
[50:04] mean he wasn't looking down through
[50:08] time right when this happens a lamb had
[50:11] done walked out it had seven horns and
[50:13] seven
[50:14] eyes verse
[50:18] seven the lamb had done walked
[50:22] out the emphasis of chapter 5
[50:25] is what you see
[50:29] next a preparation right that's going to
[50:32] take place see everything must be
[50:37] prepared then in Revelations 5 around
[50:40] said it's the
[50:43] scene y of preparing for the opening
[50:49] yep John was told chosen to see that
[50:52] event I believe you and I are chosen to
[50:54] see it today right amen but we must be
[50:57] qualified yes right to be able to see
[51:01] the opening of the book
[51:06] yes the prophet opened it that's good
[51:10] you just made in
[51:13] God because brother brandom didn't open
[51:16] the seals that's right the
[51:18] lamb my Bible says and my Prophet said
[51:21] the lamb is the one that could break the
[51:23] seals and open the book that's right run
[51:25] around couldn't do it that's
[51:27] right see how easily you make him God
[51:31] that's right and don't know it that's
[51:33] right you know that a major point if you
[51:35] want to discuss some of these things
[51:37] after service with me I'll be glad to
[51:39] but I don't just Yaky Yak on tape I
[51:41] don't time about major points of a lot
[51:43] of these doctrines is proven that
[51:45] brother brandham is almighty
[51:50] God that's their
[51:53] point right
[51:56] you say but brother Dale the seals
[51:58] opened in
[52:00] 63 that was
[52:04] only in Revelation
[52:07] form yeah the six seal didn't break in
[52:09] 63 did it no the tribulation never said
[52:12] in in 63 did it so it was Revelation to
[52:16] the prophet that's right but he was the
[52:19] only
[52:20] one that it was revealed to in its
[52:23] fullness I'm sorry he said it's G from
[52:26] you and there's no way for you to know
[52:29] it I didn't make that statement he did
[52:33] all
[52:37] right see John saw these things John saw
[52:41] it open John brother said even Daniel
[52:44] heard the
[52:47] Thunders but did he know what you
[52:51] were John heard the Thunders but was
[52:53] forbidden to ride right
[53:00] Amen brother R made a statement that you
[53:03] got to clarify real good go to number
[53:07] five he's taken from the first seal 1963
[53:10] through1 18 you talking about when it
[53:12] thundered remember a loud clap clapping
[53:15] noise of a thunder is the voice of
[53:22] God we were talking about last night in
[53:25] the Bible
[53:26] study and I've mentioned it to you
[53:29] before that they're arguing over whether
[53:31] brother random was out there when that
[53:32] Ain where the light went up these things
[53:35] happen and all of that you
[53:37] know but just go ask those
[53:39] Brothers those Brothers heard a
[53:43] thunder brother brandom Heard a
[53:46] Voice told him to go back to
[53:48] Jeffersonville he'd be told him what to
[53:50] do what he said right those Brothers
[53:53] heard a loud blast right
[53:58] y but they never
[54:01] saw the Angels Above the
[54:07] prophet didn't
[54:09] do in the Bible it thundered when Jesus
[54:12] was
[54:15] there a loud clap of Thunder is the
[54:18] voice of God he said brother what are
[54:20] the
[54:21] Thunders it's the voice of God right
[54:25] speaking to you by Revelation that's
[54:27] right of what is re sealed in the book
[54:31] simple isn't it that's a
[54:34] 1972 quote okay from blooded
[54:37] Dale all right they thought it was a
[54:40] thunder but it was God he understood it
[54:43] for it was revealed to
[54:45] him it was a thunder and notice the
[54:47] first seal opened the first seal when it
[54:50] was open in the symbol form it thundered
[54:53] now we'll get to that in Revelation 6 1
[54:56] where it says that it thundered and
[54:58] emphasize more on it but now look what
[55:01] he says now what about when it's opened
[55:03] in its reality
[55:06] form when it opened to the prophet it
[55:08] opened with a loud blast of
[55:10] thunder right what about it when it went
[55:13] finally winds up being there
[55:16] right if you've been listening to what
[55:18] I've tried to preach and some of you
[55:20] have you'll remember that back into the
[55:23] early 70s
[55:26] that I was trying my best to get you to
[55:29] see that the
[55:32] actual reality or the situations or what
[55:36] is under the seals is to
[55:40] Israel right yes we get the Revelation
[55:45] right amen by way of the prophet's
[55:48] message right amen we're not there when
[55:51] the six seal
[55:54] opens that's at least one to show for
[55:57] sealers Armageddon we're not there when
[56:01] those things are to take
[56:04] place we surely better hope we're
[56:07] not all
[56:10] right the seals then will be open to
[56:14] Israel after we leave right amen right
[56:19] can't be open to them now their mind's
[56:20] closed their eyes are blacking the Bible
[56:22] says right right you can't have him
[56:25] dealing with both this Gentile and Jew
[56:27] at the same time right amen it's when we
[56:31] leave out of here then God's going to
[56:32] Israel and remove from their eyes yes
[56:37] the blindness that has been placed there
[56:39] that's
[56:40] right and then they can
[56:44] see only after we leave cuz only after
[56:47] we leave do you have something that can
[56:49] go like
[56:52] right that's why I asked this morning
[56:54] that's a seriousness of it I'm don't
[56:56] play games I'm serious right could God
[56:59] take what you have in Revelation and
[57:02] send you to
[57:04] Israel
[57:06] right boy wouldn't it be something for a
[57:10] lot of the preachers in this message to
[57:12] go to Israel that's right well them Jews
[57:15] would laugh you off the
[57:17] street you remember that Jew that talked
[57:19] to brother randam
[57:21] yeah you talking about the guy that was
[57:24] healed
[57:25] that Jew said you can't cut cut God in
[57:27] three pieces and give him to a Jew he
[57:30] said they'll tell tell you exactly where
[57:32] that Trinity come from and show you
[57:35] exactly the books that's where it's
[57:38] at he said they know
[57:41] it where it came from right boy wouldn't
[57:45] it be something to go over there to
[57:47] Israel and you start up burn you tell
[57:49] that old Jew you know that old priest
[57:51] standing there and you say you got two
[57:53] Souls
[57:58] I don't think you'd have enough time for
[58:00] us you know like that you no but you see
[58:04] as I was saying this morning look how
[58:06] dangerous it would have
[58:08] been you remember on the video come on
[58:11] is it 20th century Prophet I don't think
[58:13] it's deep called Deep it's 20 Century
[58:15] Prophet they were planning on him they
[58:16] met with him in the video and they
[58:18] planned for him to go to Israel he
[58:20] packed up and was going to Israel he got
[58:22] over to CYO Egypt and it was and God
[58:24] told him to go he changed and went down
[58:27] through and come out another way didn't
[58:28] go to Israel around never did go to
[58:35] Israel but you see look how dangerous it
[58:39] would have
[58:42] been that je knows that
[58:45] word but he's also commanded to believe
[58:49] the
[58:50] prophets and the Bible says when a
[58:53] prophet is Vindicated ated right you
[58:56] hear him right amen right right amen
[59:00] right look how dangerous it would have
[59:02] been for brother random to walk up there
[59:04] and
[59:05] say your name is so and so your come up
[59:08] here and God don't heal you I'm a false
[59:10] prophet what do you think them Jews
[59:12] would have been
[59:14] doing
[59:17] amen but you see God wouldn't let him
[59:22] go he said okay you missionar prr go
[59:27] ahead go to if you want to a going
[59:29] listen to
[59:31] you you know that this message has been
[59:34] delivered in Israel you know this
[59:35] message there is a church or two I know
[59:38] there's one and I'd already heard of one
[59:39] before this one the last one that the
[59:41] brother even came here but there's
[59:43] churches in Israel of this message and
[59:45] you know that they're on the internet
[59:47] waves in Israel do you know that that um
[59:50] brother Perry green actually had a thing
[59:53] set up and and and had a video made of
[59:56] it and showing and had brother Brandon's
[59:58] voice speaking about Israel and what was
[1:00:01] how they were and what they were to be
[1:00:04] this message is all over the
[1:00:09] world the Jews know about
[1:00:13] this and all it be saying is let's see
[1:00:15] the sign right of the
[1:00:18] Messiah cuz the Messiah they believe to
[1:00:21] be God cuz that's what he is they want
[1:00:25] to see that sign all right but what
[1:00:27] about
[1:00:29] it when those two witnesses go over
[1:00:32] there to tell them about the book that
[1:00:35] you and I have completed and made
[1:00:38] manifest then Israel will see the
[1:00:43] light it's only after we're gone that's
[1:00:46] right God don't deal with it like
[1:00:50] that see and it won't be as I st keep
[1:00:53] stating this cuz some people want to
[1:00:54] link you together they sure you say
[1:00:56] something and they want to link you
[1:00:57] together you know with some
[1:00:59] Doctrine I don't like
[1:01:01] that I told you about the man telling me
[1:01:04] that the two witnesses would be a
[1:01:06] gentile bride and a gentile prophet and
[1:01:08] I told him no it would not be right we
[1:01:11] would have to be two Jews that would go
[1:01:13] to
[1:01:15] Israel all that is like people call it
[1:01:17] great
[1:01:23] revelation
[1:01:31] it will
[1:01:33] be the word of
[1:01:36] God that will be made known to Israel
[1:01:39] amen you agree I would agree that in the
[1:01:42] Baptist wouldn't you I mean if you asked
[1:01:44] me that question I was in the Baptist
[1:01:45] you be the word of God revealed through
[1:01:47] witnesses to the Jew I wouldn't have
[1:01:49] know much about what talking about had
[1:01:50] that much
[1:01:53] sense all right all right so then it
[1:01:56] will be the word of God that will isra
[1:01:58] that will be made known to Israel the
[1:02:00] word of God of who you are and what you
[1:02:03] have
[1:02:05] become and that you've gone off the
[1:02:07] Earth in a Rapture amen all right now
[1:02:10] with all that in
[1:02:11] mind let's pull over go ahead pull up
[1:02:14] Revelations 5 you add it up want to go
[1:02:16] Revelation
[1:02:20] 58 I may have to take another message on
[1:02:22] this Wednesday but
[1:02:25] all right don't worry about it I'll be
[1:02:26] preaching on something
[1:02:28] anyway verse
[1:02:31] eight and when he had taken the book The
[1:02:34] Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders
[1:02:36] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:02:37] one of them hearts and V going to V full
[1:02:40] of ERS which are the priers of the
[1:02:43] Saints now over in Revelation
[1:02:46] 85 now if I miss that I believe that's
[1:02:48] right it tells you about the the prayers
[1:02:50] of the Saints it tells you what that is
[1:02:54] you know
[1:02:55] the prayers of the Saints the vs poured
[1:02:57] out that's why the tribulation sets in
[1:03:00] is because you are gone and there's no
[1:03:03] one to try to intercede with God he said
[1:03:08] but there'd be a lot of good people left
[1:03:11] right there was a lot of good people
[1:03:15] down in
[1:03:16] Sodom but there was only one man that
[1:03:20] could deal with God and say God
[1:03:24] if I find
[1:03:26] 50 will you sp that's
[1:03:29] right
[1:03:33] yes Lord if I find
[1:03:36] 40 you know what he got it down to about
[1:03:38] 10 or five didn't
[1:03:40] he and they wouldn't five of them out
[1:03:47] there see what causes the tribulation to
[1:03:50] take place is it's the wrath of God
[1:03:52] poured out upon the Earth because
[1:03:54] there's no more prior of the Saints for
[1:03:58] intercession
[1:04:00] right he said no we're not cath no we're
[1:04:02] not Catholic but the prayers you're
[1:04:05] making for your families are the ones
[1:04:08] that God is hearing to bring them in
[1:04:13] amen once that's gone there's no more
[1:04:17] prayers so that means exactly the
[1:04:20] prayers of the
[1:04:23] Saints
[1:04:24] yes you'll find later I believe it's 8:5
[1:04:28] that they're poured
[1:04:29] out and look and they sang a new song M
[1:04:34] then they AR worthy to take the book and
[1:04:35] open the seals thereof the book still s
[1:04:42] yeah come on you want to
[1:04:47] read the book is still sealed at that
[1:04:49] period of
[1:04:50] time why because it had to be sealed up
[1:04:53] before it could be sealed
[1:04:57] amen for thou are slain and H has
[1:04:59] redeemed us to God by th blood out of
[1:05:01] every Kindred tongue and people and
[1:05:04] Nation okay
[1:05:08] now they asked brother Brandon go ahead
[1:05:11] with that
[1:05:16] quote
[1:05:18] at number
[1:05:20] six number six they ask brother Brandon
[1:05:25] about Revelations
[1:05:28] 5 was that the
[1:05:32] science his answer was no yep that is
[1:05:36] not the
[1:05:42] redeem Revelations 5 singing when the
[1:05:46] lamb takes a book out
[1:05:48] of are these the raptured Saints
[1:05:52] no h
[1:05:55] sure Revelation 6 5
[1:05:59] and9 not
[1:06:01] 6 he's jumping over but it's fth chapter
[1:06:05] 8th verse and then going down to nine
[1:06:07] and on if you notice these are not the
[1:06:10] Saints he has never claimed his property
[1:06:19] yet this is not the Saints if you'll
[1:06:22] notice they're the elders and the Beast
[1:06:24] and they
[1:06:26] seem it is not the bride so he goes to
[1:06:29] the bottom and says Thou Hast redeemed
[1:06:31] us and made us priests and Kings he
[1:06:34] reads the scripture himself
[1:06:37] y
[1:06:40] much that's the Heavenly group not yet
[1:06:43] the
[1:06:45] redeemed and he read the
[1:06:51] scriptures right which are the priers of
[1:06:53] the Saints and they sang a new
[1:06:56] song Why would brother Brandon say that
[1:07:00] was not the
[1:07:13] bride why would he say
[1:07:18] that do you know why he said
[1:07:22] that I don't mean wrong wrong I mean
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:27] right I don't mean smart ethically do
[1:07:31] you know why he said
[1:07:46] that you said what going on down to the
[1:07:48] other but let's deal with this how come
[1:07:51] he said
[1:07:52] that
[1:07:57] I told you at the end of the service
[1:07:58] this
[1:08:01] morning had he said that was
[1:08:07] the the bride he would have been exactly
[1:08:10] right but when he said it wasn't the
[1:08:18] bride you said well that don't mean
[1:08:21] nothing to
[1:08:22] me
[1:08:24] why did he say
[1:08:29] it what was it that was making it a
[1:08:34] mystery that's what I titled this part
[1:08:37] of the message today the
[1:08:40] mystery what was the mysterious part
[1:08:43] that was there that would cause him to
[1:08:45] say
[1:08:49] that he was saying it because of his own
[1:08:52] teaching
[1:09:01] that's
[1:09:02] quiet them old Wheels is a turny
[1:09:06] Ain some of them are grinding into a
[1:09:08] halt and
[1:09:11] squeaking and old brains are eroding and
[1:09:14] I like
[1:09:16] that either that or you
[1:09:19] sleep and I don't see anybody at this
[1:09:22] time that is that so
[1:09:24] all
[1:09:25] right but why would a prophet say
[1:09:30] right when he's done went through
[1:09:33] chapter
[1:09:36] 4 Y and he
[1:09:39] already has
[1:09:42] said that the Rapture comes in chapter 4
[1:09:49] verse1 John typed the Rapture Y how many
[1:09:52] messages back to that that okay you see
[1:09:55] what I've been doing digging it in
[1:09:57] digging it in digging it in digging it
[1:09:59] in CU I realize what do they say that
[1:10:03] you only retain 5% of what you
[1:10:08] hear that's why a movie you know I told
[1:10:10] you the other day what they do in these
[1:10:12] movies now you notice it goes in the
[1:10:13] scene and all you kick off over here
[1:10:16] something exciting happening and then
[1:10:18] they'll jump back to here CU they've
[1:10:19] proven that if you keep running that
[1:10:21] channel and they keep that scene going
[1:10:23] going and N Scurry home like that that
[1:10:25] you just get totally
[1:10:29] nonchalant so they proved that there you
[1:10:32] go change it off to another scene keep
[1:10:34] it going fast so that way the Mind
[1:10:37] clicks
[1:10:40] back I've been putting it in for a long
[1:10:43] time waiting for a time to say what I
[1:10:46] want to say and it's 20 minutes till for
[1:10:47] so we
[1:10:51] be I'm not jimy that's long so you going
[1:10:54] not beay with me today okay amen sorry
[1:10:57] good but you know brother Brandon why
[1:11:01] are you saying that that is not the
[1:11:05] bride when you've already said the bride
[1:11:07] goes
[1:11:10] up in Revelations 4:1 yeah why would you
[1:11:14] say
[1:11:16] that well he was just tired and he was
[1:11:18] weary
[1:11:22] and
[1:11:29] when cuz you
[1:11:32] see brother R was juggling between
[1:11:34] brother R's mind was juggling between
[1:11:36] Earthly events and Heavenly events
[1:11:41] sure and he says this is not the
[1:11:47] bride see because this is what he always
[1:11:50] taught
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:54] he always
[1:11:56] taught that the bride goes up going on
[1:11:58] number
[1:12:00] seven this is what your Prophet is
[1:12:03] taught and a lot of people thinks wonder
[1:12:05] why brother Dale would would this deal
[1:12:09] on these thing so much paragraph
[1:12:14] 24 now Revelations the first three
[1:12:17] chapters deals with the church then the
[1:12:19] church disappears and we see it no more
[1:12:21] until the end time from Revelation 1 to3
[1:12:25] is the church Revelations
[1:12:28] 4-9 is Israel a nation and 19 to 22 is
[1:12:33] both of them together the things right
[1:12:37] okay brother randam had taught this
[1:12:41] before the opening of the
[1:12:43] seals go to the next one number
[1:12:46] eight Revelations 4 part 1 oh and notice
[1:12:51] John being taken up immediately after
[1:12:52] the church AG for the top of the
[1:12:53] raptured church immediately after the
[1:12:56] church age is over this lady will see an
[1:12:57] age then comes the Rapture the church
[1:13:00] goes up like John did into the presence
[1:13:02] of God oh my we that just winds my soul
[1:13:06] around caught up in the Rapture the
[1:13:07] church and it said this place the Book
[1:13:11] of Revelation was written to see at the
[1:13:14] end of the church age all right now
[1:13:18] he's taught these
[1:13:22] things
[1:13:26] he's taught
[1:13:27] that the church goes up
[1:13:31] right so he's looking at this group of
[1:13:37] people and realizes the seals ain't
[1:13:39] broke
[1:13:42] yet right come on did we read that in
[1:13:46] Revelations 5 he takes the book and gets
[1:13:49] ready to opening of the seal the opening
[1:13:51] of the seals in chapter 6 right right
[1:13:55] yeah so brother brother R's mind is
[1:13:57] dealing with this is
[1:14:02] Israel you said well how do you know
[1:14:04] well that's what he says 4:19 is
[1:14:08] Israel from 4 to 19 right is
[1:14:14] Israel after the Rapture of the
[1:14:20] church and he's teaching it
[1:14:26] as bringing it down the line of what's
[1:14:28] to come next right we go up
[1:14:33] right we go up 41
[1:14:36] Yep this is 58
[1:14:42] nine he's thinking that's Israel cuz if
[1:14:46] it's not the Saints who else could it be
[1:14:49] that's
[1:14:49] right come
[1:14:52] on
[1:14:53] who else could it be if it's not the
[1:14:57] bride there's only two Redemptive forms
[1:15:00] to be made in the Book of Revelation
[1:15:03] yes the others is given eternal life at
[1:15:06] the white Throne Etc and things that's
[1:15:08] not Redemptive forms that's right the
[1:15:11] only two Redemptive forms in the Book of
[1:15:13] Revelation is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:16] and the 144,000 that's true
[1:15:19] MH because 144,000 receive eternal life
[1:15:23] they right here amen all right that
[1:15:25] don't make them bride that's right
[1:15:29] amen but you
[1:15:32] see because of what he Tau right he was
[1:15:36] saying this was Israel
[1:15:39] right
[1:15:45] now if that was Israel in Revelations 5
[1:15:49] or is
[1:15:52] Israel then were
[1:16:00] we come on wake
[1:16:03] up where are
[1:16:07] we oh we the we the we the throne we the
[1:16:10] book we yeah because of that
[1:16:13] being Revelation 5 being
[1:16:16] us but if that's Israel you just blowed
[1:16:20] your whole Plan of Redemption far the
[1:16:23] bride and for Israel and you cannot find
[1:16:27] the
[1:16:28] bride in
[1:16:34] heaven you would have to jump over to
[1:16:36] the 19th Chapter and come writing back
[1:16:43] right no if he' left it there what would
[1:16:46] that have
[1:16:49] been total wrong
[1:16:52] Doctrine well the Holy Spirit didn't do
[1:16:54] that it stopped him right we'll get to
[1:16:56] that in a
[1:16:58] second but just to go on to show you how
[1:17:00] much he believe
[1:17:04] this that we go up and then the seals
[1:17:06] are broke to Israel yeah go on to number
[1:17:11] nine let's read a few of these God being
[1:17:15] misunderstood 61 this is still before
[1:17:17] the SE and then remember if if the Lord
[1:17:20] willing in next Sunday I want to do my
[1:17:24] best by the grace of God to
[1:17:26] explain the 70 weeks of
[1:17:30] Daniel as I said this morning it's a
[1:17:32] great
[1:17:33] scripture and it's not so much to speak
[1:17:36] on but to place it where it belongs
[1:17:41] to make it fit with the rest of the
[1:17:44] Bible
[1:17:46] right got a place at 70 weeks
[1:17:49] D and we have started with Revelations 1
[1:17:53] got over in the sixth chapter and of
[1:17:56] course we get in now to the seven seal
[1:17:59] like seals and those seals will run from
[1:18:02] the sixth last part of the sixth chapter
[1:18:05] unto the 19th Chapter inclusive so it
[1:18:09] would take a long time now I could take
[1:18:12] say seven nights and run the Seven Seals
[1:18:14] open them up but if you do it that way
[1:18:17] then the people will miss the great
[1:18:19] part back here that fields in this
[1:18:24] yes okay when the church goes
[1:18:28] up read in
[1:18:31] between that's the last part of the
[1:18:35] church part excuse last of the church
[1:18:38] until she comes with her Lord as bride
[1:18:42] and
[1:18:43] remember excuse her Lord as bride
[1:18:45] bridegroom and in the 19th Chapter
[1:18:48] during this time between
[1:18:51] what
[1:18:54] 41 we'll read that again during this
[1:18:57] time it's dealing with
[1:19:01] Israel and to get to 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:19:04] in now it sets the picture for the
[1:19:08] coming
[1:19:10] open first
[1:19:13] F now I didn't give you this one but can
[1:19:17] you pull that one up now brother
[1:19:20] Anderson of the paragraph 71 gabel's
[1:19:24] instruction to
[1:19:26] Daniel I think he's going let him down
[1:19:28] sometime they got to hunt for him
[1:19:31] okay look what he says in Gabriel's
[1:19:34] instructions to
[1:19:35] Daniel read 1961
[1:19:38] 730 Revelation 61 to 1921 is connected
[1:19:42] with the 70 weeks 70 OD weeks therefore
[1:19:45] we must stop and explain before we go
[1:19:47] further we must stop and explain why
[1:19:50] these 70 of weeks because if it don't
[1:19:52] don't you miss those
[1:19:54] seals everybody knows all about the
[1:19:56] seals don't about said you it's Daniel
[1:19:59] you miss the trumpets you don't he hear
[1:20:01] them preach song you miss those vows you
[1:20:04] don't hear that preach song Those
[1:20:06] plagues don't hear that those three
[1:20:07] unclean Spirit like frog you don't hear
[1:20:09] that one those three woes the casting
[1:20:12] out of the red dragon the woman and the
[1:20:13] sun you miss it
[1:20:16] all if you don't because it takes place
[1:20:19] right here in this 70th week absolutely
[1:20:23] that's where it takes place so you can't
[1:20:25] understand the seals and the things I
[1:20:28] understand in Daniel 70
[1:20:29] weeks how many times have I said that to
[1:20:36] you let continue on now with
[1:20:39] number
[1:20:42] nine make number
[1:20:44] nine got to read number
[1:20:48] nine no we didn't read them excuse me
[1:20:51] you read nine go to 10 excuse me okay
[1:20:53] look you all right y'all ahead of me
[1:20:56] that's good taking sides with Jesus
[1:20:59] still before the SE right which we
[1:21:02] realize in Revelations it's just one two
[1:21:04] three chapters to the church the church
[1:21:07] goes up in the fourth chapter it does
[1:21:10] not return anymore till the 19th Chapter
[1:21:14] that's after the tribulation period when
[1:21:17] God called out the
[1:21:19] Jews now here's where we got it ride
[1:21:23] something go
[1:21:26] listen higher
[1:21:30] higher
[1:21:33] listen seals will be dealing on earth
[1:21:38] right in
[1:21:41] time the bride is up in
[1:21:46] heaven so the bride is not seen on
[1:21:51] Earth after tell 4
[1:21:54] right until the 19th Chapter when she
[1:21:57] rides back with
[1:21:59] him right but it doesn't say she can't
[1:22:03] be seen
[1:22:04] somewhere cuz in chapter five she's in
[1:22:06] heaven
[1:22:09] right oh you're dealing with two
[1:22:13] things Church goes up and does not
[1:22:15] return work to
[1:22:17] Earth right now going to Lev
[1:22:26] this is on the
[1:22:27] breach 1963 317 now then we're going to
[1:22:31] turn to the fifth chapter now this is
[1:22:34] not the Seven
[1:22:36] Seals it is the breach between the
[1:22:38] church ages and the Seven Seals okay now
[1:22:41] there is also a sixth chapter and there
[1:22:44] was a fourth chapter rather Revelation
[1:22:47] and in that it kind of reveals something
[1:22:48] that would take place after the church
[1:22:51] going up and the church goes up in the
[1:22:54] third chapter of Revelation see the last
[1:22:56] verses
[1:22:59] right and does not return until the 19th
[1:23:03] Chapter of Revelation therefore the
[1:23:05] church misses the tribulation right the
[1:23:08] Glorious thing go to the
[1:23:13] next this goes into the first
[1:23:16] seal 63 3:18 now the Holy Spirit and the
[1:23:20] Revelation and the re
[1:23:23] and Christ is the holy spirit is Christ
[1:23:25] in another form that's right notice it
[1:23:27] is a lamb that opened the book and the
[1:23:30] lamb is
[1:23:31] Christ Now read it and Christ is not
[1:23:36] seen anymore from then now what does he
[1:23:42] mean chapter one The Lamb is Christ
[1:23:44] opening the
[1:23:49] boat but remember when you leave out of
[1:23:52] here you're you're the Christ that's
[1:23:55] right that's right the bride not see
[1:23:58] anymore don't out here she not seen on
[1:24:01] Earth no more till 19 see you're the
[1:24:03] Christ he said oh that's too much okay
[1:24:06] you don't remember what we was reading
[1:24:07] this morning then that the bride of
[1:24:09] Christ is the fullness of the godhead
[1:24:14] bodily but he is seen in the Book of
[1:24:16] Revelation the 19th Chapter coming on
[1:24:18] the White
[1:24:19] Horse you want to turn there and read it
[1:24:21] go ahead to the next one
[1:24:25] paragraph 287 verse Seal and notice
[1:24:28] Christ is not seen anymore see from the
[1:24:30] time there when he is on a white horse
[1:24:34] so if this guy is riding a white horse
[1:24:37] he's on an impersonator he's going on in
[1:24:39] but he's not seen anymore from there
[1:24:41] okay going on to the
[1:24:43] next this is taken from the fifth seal
[1:24:46] but the reason that he reveals that I as
[1:24:49] I understand that is because the mystery
[1:24:52] the book of redemption as far as the
[1:24:55] Antichrist being real revealed and the
[1:24:59] at the same
[1:25:01] time the church is
[1:25:03] gone and these these things don't even
[1:25:07] happen in the church age at all that's
[1:25:10] right they're there away from the church
[1:25:12] age the church absolutely is raptured at
[1:25:15] this time Jus not down here right for
[1:25:20] one to go up not down here
[1:25:23] Israel's down here getting the the
[1:25:27] seals the persecution the trial we're
[1:25:31] gone Church goes up the fourth chapter
[1:25:33] of Revelation does not return until it
[1:25:35] comes back with him and with his King
[1:25:38] see ly remember this morning come back
[1:25:41] with the King not a lamb we don't ride
[1:25:43] back in 19 with a lamb we ride back with
[1:25:45] the King we're husband and wife right
[1:25:48] all right cuz her wife bride has made
[1:25:49] herself ready these seals here are
[1:25:51] revealing has been what is what will be
[1:25:53] and all it's revealing the SE let's go
[1:25:55] to the next I like about two more and
[1:25:57] I'll bit
[1:26:00] through this is taken from the Feast of
[1:26:02] the
[1:26:04] trumpets the first preached in 64 719
[1:26:07] after the seal was preached the first
[1:26:10] three chapters of the Book of Revelation
[1:26:11] revealed all the happenings unto the
[1:26:13] church then from the third chapter into
[1:26:15] the 19th Chapter Revelation there is no
[1:26:17] more scene of the church he's talking
[1:26:18] about bride right not Church bride the
[1:26:22] church goes up at the fourth chapter of
[1:26:24] Revelation and returns back at the 19th
[1:26:26] Chapter of Revelation the bride and
[1:26:27] groom together coming to the Earth y all
[1:26:32] right
[1:26:35] now go ahead and put up number
[1:26:38] 16 because that is the one where he says
[1:26:43] it's the finish of what I started a
[1:26:45] while ago coming down and where they
[1:26:47] asked him the question and he comes back
[1:26:50] and he says there's something wrong
[1:26:52] there something
[1:26:54] wrong that's all that's just all there
[1:26:57] is to it there's something WR happens
[1:27:00] see the Holy Spirit started correcting
[1:27:01] him but he didn't know what it
[1:27:03] was right there's something that went
[1:27:06] wrong somewhere everybody feeling all
[1:27:08] right there's no there's no sickness or
[1:27:12] or nothing a man in the congregation
[1:27:14] requests that brother Brown read
[1:27:16] Revelations 59
[1:27:18] again let's see Revelation where was it
[1:27:22] brother oh oh oh question the question I
[1:27:25] was answering now let's see see all
[1:27:27] right so he gets to Revelations
[1:27:30] 5 and he reads it Y and he sees that
[1:27:36] they sang a new song right it was worthy
[1:27:39] to take the book and thou Hast redeemed
[1:27:41] us to God right right remember what he
[1:27:45] said the first part of it this is not
[1:27:47] the redeemed this is not the Saints the
[1:27:51] Holy Spirit says it is the Saints in
[1:27:55] heaven this is not an Earthly thing it's
[1:27:58] in heaven that's right what do you think
[1:28:01] about that oh the presence of the holy
[1:28:03] spirit is here what is he wouldn't let
[1:28:06] him answer that you read on down he
[1:28:08] wouldn't let him answer he goes on down
[1:28:10] he
[1:28:12] says that these are the redeemed y you
[1:28:16] got the quote they got it on the
[1:28:17] internet they can read it now let me
[1:28:18] preach a
[1:28:21] second
[1:28:23] see you can read it cuz I got to get
[1:28:28] through see if brother Brandon would
[1:28:30] have left that he was referring to
[1:28:32] Revelations 5 as being Israel who else
[1:28:36] would have been referring to it as being
[1:28:38] right but when he was corrected he said
[1:28:40] no that is the bride there we are in
[1:28:44] glory the bride of
[1:28:46] Christ in glory with him
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:54] but just
[1:28:56] remember if he said that was Israel and
[1:28:58] left it you would have had an incomplete
[1:29:05] book come on you may not see the danger
[1:29:08] of what it was the danger there was just
[1:29:11] as much danger when he said the white
[1:29:13] horse rider was the Holy Spirit right
[1:29:17] yep he would have been glorifying Satan
[1:29:20] yep for saying that
[1:29:23] now he would be making Israel the bride
[1:29:26] shedding in glory in chapter 5 and you
[1:29:29] and I would have no
[1:29:35] place the holy spirit says that ain't
[1:29:38] right he rereads it and he said I was
[1:29:41] wrong see I was wrong about said that is
[1:29:43] the
[1:29:45] bride she's in glory amen amen right now
[1:29:49] you got a book to go to Israel yeah cuz
[1:29:53] Israel ain't seen until you get over to
[1:29:55] the sixth
[1:29:58] chapter come on Israel's not in the
[1:30:00] fifth chapter
[1:30:03] right the bride I'll get on it Wednesday
[1:30:05] and just back up enough and preach it
[1:30:07] because to show you what they doing cuz
[1:30:09] they say we're Kings we're
[1:30:12] priests amen under almighty God
[1:30:17] sure you see how far he would have
[1:30:19] missed it he would have been making that
[1:30:22] yep Israel and he made her the
[1:30:26] bride so you can't do that no she'll
[1:30:29] never come back to be bride she comes
[1:30:32] back to be servant that's right so now
[1:30:35] you have the Plan of Redemption it goes
[1:30:37] all the way through and you have what
[1:30:39] I've tried to prove to you for many many
[1:30:42] years the seals are to Israel right
[1:30:45] that's right so when the seals start
[1:30:47] breaking in Revelation
[1:30:50] 61 it's not breaking in
[1:30:53] heaven right it's breaking on earth
[1:30:56] right
[1:30:58] right through two
[1:31:03] prophets but brother Dale you go all the
[1:31:06] way through and show that brother R was
[1:31:08] talking about that we're in the seals
[1:31:11] we're in the revelation of the seals
[1:31:13] right right we're not in the reality of
[1:31:16] the seals that's right they ask him one
[1:31:19] sensible
[1:31:20] question and I say that in stating it
[1:31:24] factly he said don't give me questions
[1:31:27] on anything but on these seals he preach
[1:31:29] six right and he said give me questions
[1:31:32] on the seals one
[1:31:39] question the question was does brother
[1:31:42] brandom do this Thessalonians D the man
[1:31:44] of sin sitting in the temple of God
[1:31:46] showing himself to be as God that
[1:31:48] fulfill the first seal he said yes yes
[1:31:50] right the rest of it is should they wear
[1:31:52] peny Hool should he wear this how should
[1:31:54] he be baptized why does it say father
[1:31:56] son Holy
[1:32:02] Ghost no wonder he said it's gone from
[1:32:06] me right
[1:32:08] sir he read the

[1:34:18] all evening and stay here if you want to
[1:34:21] well let's read the
[1:34:23] scripture Paul said in the 11th chapter
[1:34:25] verse 23 of First Corinthians for I re
[1:34:29] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:34:31] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:34:33] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:34:35] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:34:37] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:34:39] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:34:41] remembrance of me after the same man
[1:34:44] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:34:46] saying this cup is the New Testament and
[1:34:48] my blood this do ye as of as you drink
[1:34:50] it and remember rembrance of me where as
[1:34:53] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:34:54] this cup you do sh the Lord's death till
[1:34:56] he come wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:34:59] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:35:00] Lord unworthily you'll be guilty of the
[1:35:03] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:35:05] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:35:07] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:35:09] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:35:10] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:35:13] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:35:15] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:35:17] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:35:19] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:35:21] when we are judged we are chasing of the
[1:35:23] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:35:26] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:35:28] when you come together to eat carry one
[1:35:31] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:35:33] him eat at home that you come not
