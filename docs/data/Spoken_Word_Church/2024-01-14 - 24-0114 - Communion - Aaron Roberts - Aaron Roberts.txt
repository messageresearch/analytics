========================================

good morning good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and so it has fallen my lot this morning so just look to the Lord this morning and uh en always enjoy brother Bob and brother John and the different ones so this morning before we read the scripture let's just pray right quick Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for another time to be in your house Lord together around with Believers and we just pray the Lord that you help us this morning Lord as we look unto you for all that we have need of Father we just pray that you come speak to us this morning Lord as we've prayed over the needs Lord there's many that haven't have desire to be here today Lord but they're not able to we just pray that you be with them Lord bless the Sunday School classes bless brother Wade as he comes this morning Lord Jesus Lord just give us what we have need of today we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen this morning I take a thought on communion and uh I want to read from Genesis chapter 14 and beginning at verse 16 and speaking of Abraham and it says he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also in the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter CH Lamar and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Shava which is as which is the King's Dale and mzc king of Salem brought forth what Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave ties of all and so this morning I want to I I believe that's the first time we we see the Bread and Wine mentioned there in the scripture talking about communion but uh brother BR speaking in the in the message remembering the Lord and this is a a quote I caught my attention I I I just like this and uh brother Ram says a communion with the Lord is like an oasis in the desert it's like the spring underneath the pond where the traveler coming by stops and drinks the water till he quenches his thirst he says Contin on coming by the order of his table we're the passing Pilgrim that's so journeying here on Earth with us together that we can come by his Table and there drink of His blessings and of his grace and of his word and fellowship around his word until our thirsty souls are satisfied then we are then when we leave the place of worship refreshed satisfied going out to meet the desert's problems again the problems of life's desert yes an oasis in the desert refreshing ourselves making ourself when we're thirsty he said it is with every true worshipper that they long to get together there's something about the fellowship that's Divine it's ordered of God it's holy it's sacred and the righteous are thirsting after it and then he was speaking of David you know I thirst after God like the heart for the water broke and you know just having a desire to get to that water and this morning you know I was thinking about communion and many times brother Brown talks about we we put the emphasis on the on the bread and the wine but you know brother R said it it's communion is to have fellowship and it's to have have to talk to God and have him talk to us and and that's real communion and when you speak about the communion when he starts to talk about having Fellowship brother brand talks one time he says he said we are Kings and Priests tonight and he was talking about Jesus being the son of man and he said the you know the birds have nest and the foxes have Den but the son of man has no place to lay his head and you know but but he knew who he was he had a he had a because of who he was he knew what his commission was what God had called him to do because he was God made flesh and and you know when he was here and brother R says he we're Kings and Priests tonight just like he was he said what different does it make whether we have or whether we haven't he said as long as we got God he said we are more than conquerors he said we are more than conquerors he said we sit in the presence of God In The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit taking spiritual communion from the hands of him that testified he said I was he that was dead and live again and I alive forever more he said sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh blessed be the holy name he said what difference does it make and you know so I I want to look at that this morning and and maybe look at it some more and in the future but you know it's it's having communion with God and having this fellowship and and and thinking about you know we we look at the scripture there in in Genesis when it when it talks about Abraham and Abraham went forth to uh go after lot when when his brother was taken and you know something just stirred up inside of Abraham to go after his brother and you know he had a desire to go to restore his brother and you know to bring him back into Fellowship brother BR talked about you know he said if we don't have that desire to go after the ones that have L that's been gone that walk away he said you know we ought to be in the altar if we don't have that desire to go after our brother that's not in fellowship if we because you know here he was and you know it was by his lot's own choice to do that it brought him to that place but you know what lot didn't say well we'll just forget about him you know he's he's made his bed his line in it but lot but Abraham didn't have it didn't have that that thought he didn't act that way about it he knew that was his brother and he was in in a place that he needed to be restored from he needed to be rescued and he went after him and you know when when you look at all you all the the Kings and the the battle that was going on and here's here's Abraham but he had this desire to go after his brother and it was him and 318 men and it's like you know it's like this great battle's taking place these Kings have come this armies have come to battle and Abraham's out there with 318 it's like well that you know that's a that's a great that's of great odds you've got these almost insurmountable odds of this great battle that you but you know what Abraham went and it's like well it looks really bad but you know that that doesn't change the fact that if that if we are a part of God if we have a brother or sister that's Fallen you know no matter what condition they're in you know what as long as they're still drawing breath then you know what there's still Mercy there's still Grace there so no matter what the condition is it's our it's our responsibility to lift them up to go after them you know and to those that have fallen by the because you know what we've all Fallen by the wayside we've all stumbled we've all failed we all needed to be uh restored yes right you know and and it because many times we look at people in the condition that they went through it's like there but for the grace of God go I that that I see the condition that people are in and I want them to be restored I want them to be the at the best place that they can be at what God has for them and it takes you and I to come in to be in Fellowship to come to that place and you know one of the things that and so you know here he is when he returns you know mzc meets him and brings him the uh the oil and the wine or the bread and the wine and he comes and you know he has fellowship and He blesses Abraham but you know it when when you see this taking place you know it it it has to um have you have to have Fellowship to come together we all have to be one right you know one one of the things I was I was reading that and one of the things I I was thinking about was you know you know when it comes to communion and communion has in fellowship and you here where brother Brown talks about us coming to the table and eating well this morning there's a table spread where we're eating this morning right we're having spiritual communion this morning with him and you know and everybody what what struck me was you know lots of times people's like well you know I can I can do it on my own I'm okay and it's like no you're no you can't right and you know when you look at all the times when he talks about having communion even brother speaking here you know even when Jesus had all the disciples together at the table and they were eating when he broke the bread you know it was it was they had to come together to do that and and mzc come to Abraham and you know it's like because you can have Fellowship but it's so important to come together amen because you know what you can't have communion by yourself you know because when when because even in the communion scripture when when you read that and you see where it says you know when we come together and we T together we t with one another in the in this communion because it's not it's not something that you do solo it's not something you do by yourself now I know I know we commun with God on a in a in at times where it's just you and him it's just you and God and you're fellowshipping but you know what you can't you can't forsake the assembling amen it you it requires all of us to be together and you know it's like all of us having that desire to come together to Fellowship to have it we're we're here together because you know when you when you miss out it really it takes away from because you can listen to the sermons and it does and I've been blessed by it but you know what there's nothing that'll take the place of being here with your brothers and sisters being in this building and being in the house of God and fellowshipping one with another because you know what you you gain strength from one another when you bring your lick of fire and and I bring my lick of fire then you know what we know that God we'll hear from God this morning why because he said whether two or three are gathered in my name he said I'm they're in the midst right and so when we commune see we want to talk to God but you know this morning I many times we we pray and I'm guilty of this myself you know we pray and we just want to talk to God it's just like we just want to unload and then when we get empty we feel like well I've got that off my chest and then we stop and you know it's you know how how difficult it is or how terrible it is if you have a relationship with somebody and all you want to do is talk the whole time and you never want to listen you know because if you if you're if you're married and and and your and your husband does all the talking and and you you never and and you like well you know what why don't you be quiet for a minute so I can talk and it feels like you know because they're not they're not important because you don't take the time to listen to what they have to say and sometimes it's the wife you know she's just because things build up and it's just like I want to listen I want you to listen to what I got to say and sometimes you know because when we pray it's just like you unload and it's like well I'm done and we failed to take the time to say well Lord what you got to say to me it's like look I I want to I want to communicate I want to speak to you but I want you to speak to me and sometimes it's very hard because when you go through difficult situations and times and you know you you just feel like you got so much to unload and you get all this off your chest and when the Lord speaks to you sometimes the Lord tells you things that you don't want to hear and it's just like do I hear that right it's like why Lord and it's just like we we feel like we're we get so burdened but overloaded but you know God knows what he's doing amen and he has and he has the best for us and sometimes you know we don't see we don't see everything but you know if we just trust in him when he speaks to us he always speaks the right answer amen see it's to talk it's to communicate to speak back he said that's communing is being able to speak to one another and so he was speaking of the of the the bread and the wine see he said it's the real communion is the holy spirit speaking back to us he said when you ask him then he speaks back back that is correct communion to be able to commune and let him speak back and talk to and have him talk back to us to speak he said I think that's some of the Bless The Most Blessed time of the services he said every hour of our life ought to be a communion when he is speaking back to us and and this is from possessing all things brother BR says not to commune you commune as you eat with one another he said just commune with God the communion is not the bread not the wine he said the communion is talking back and forth with God he said see he said this is the symbol that we take that we believe in his death broken body his burial his resurrection we believe in the presence of the Holy Spirit and we believe that he has give us eternal life and we cannot die we have passed passed from death into life and someday when we separate from one another here we'll rise again in the resurrection with each other joined together with Christ Jesus as a body so he's amen upon this basis and upon the confession of my sins he said we take these articles of these things because we we know that based on this we're communing with each other but it's not just the Bread and Wine but we eating the together here and we we take these things that are given to us in Fellowship brother R says communion communion also means Thanksgiving giving thanks to God for the things that he's done and he says because he he was talking here in in the message the key to the door and he was talking about you know the Catholics taking communion and you know they're they're hoping for something because they're they're hoping that something takes place but you know what a Believer shouldn't no one should be taking communion unless they've passed from death into life right and see when when see they're he said they're taking communion praying for and hoping that something's going to take place that they that this is going to happen but we take communion as commemoration that you know what we have passed from Death unto life that's something that he's already something that's already been done for us and we see this because it's it's a commemoration of what he's done for us but it's a commemoration of what takes place should be taking place every single day that we commune with him that we're eating the bread of life because he is the bread of life and we should be eating of that every single day and brother r speaking here and he was talking about being Beggars he said we're all Beggars he said it's just like this he said one is a beggar hoping that everything's all right see the other one is a beggar thanking God for what's already been done he said they're both Beggars not one is begging hoping but one is begging hoping he'll get it the other beggar knows he's got it and thanked him for giv it to him he said no there's the difference that's communion yes sir one is hoping that he's forgiven the other one knows he's forgiven and giving thanks for it why because we were Beggars we didn't have anything in this life everything that we have came from God but you know what God brought us to the place we are today and to have true communion is to give thanks to God for what he's given us where he's brought us to what he's brought us from see we have communion with him he says speaking of of mesic see he said after after this battle is taking place so you there's an overcoming that has to take place in your life he said when you when you come to that place then you receive communion with God and you know I know many times brother BR talks about communion when this when this battle Earthly battle is all over with but you know when there's there's a battle that you have to fight to overcome and when you overcome you got to press your way into the kingdom the new birth is a battle and you've got to fight your way in but he said after that you receive he said he gives you a part of himself he said become the communion because communion is part of Christ he said after the struggle is after you've done got yourself whed out then is when you partake of Christ become part of his being you see it so then there is that part of it when you've battled it out there's a battle that takes place inside of you that you've got to overcome and then there's communion with him that he comes to you that you become you receive a part of him well if you've received a part of him then when we take communion that is that is showing that we've overcome and that we have taken a part of him that we've received a part of him through that overcoming just as Abraham did we've wrestled it out and we've become a part of God and then we are able to partake of that communion when the battle is over and the Victory is won see then we able to come out and receive a part of him we have communion that's the way that we have communion with God and brother R talks about the wine coming into fellowship with God see he says the wine he said wine gets stronger better and stronger as it gets older he said it never loses its strength so when we receive that you know praise God it never gets it never gets weaker it only gets stronger it only gets better he said the blood of Christ doesn't sour and spoil it but it gets older as it gets older it gets stronger and better as the days go by to the believer and he says he said it is a literal wine and bread communion bread should be made by those that is dedicated to themselves and consecrated themselves but see the wine gets better it doesn't lose in strength because it's a type of the blood of Christ and so it doesn't as it never gets weaker the blood will never lose its power what it's all what it's been able to do in the past it will always be able to do amen and it and the believer it ought to get better and stronger and so when you see how the the the bread was a broken body showing the body was broken for us that bread was broken even in even in the Old Testament brother M talks about the shoe bread in the Old Testament he said there was three pieces of bread there and he said that middle piece was broken and the shoe bread and he said that that middle piece was broken showing that Christ was broken because he had to come between us and God and there was a piece that was broken why because that piece represented the the chasm that was between us that was something that had to cover between us to bring us back into Fellowship there was one that was broken for us to bring us back and we've come back into Fellowship see and we see it's a broken body it was he was broken at Calvary to be our prici for our sins he said through his righteousness we might become his righteousness he said because he became our sin that we might become his righteous he said brother that's purely Grace so when we see what God has done for us how we've come it back he's brought us back into Fellowship through the through his work at Calvary what he's done and now we've been able to receive that yes the very life of Jesus Christ you know and and so if you have received that that you want to have fellowship with God and how can how can you not have fellowship with God and not want to have fellowship with your brothers and sisters want not you know to have Fellowship to be here and to Fellowship around the word right because that's that's the greatest thing that we can do if we want to draw closer to God then how can how can we get closer to God if we can't get closer to our brothers and sisters and see that's that's where the devil wants to try to hinder us is to get in and try to hinder your brother or sister try to hinder you always try to put something between you and your brother always something between you and your sister and see you can't have you can't have right fellowship with God if there's if there's a problem the scripture tells us that you know if we know our brother's got an ALT against us you know we need to go take care of that right even even if somebody even if we think there's a problem you know not not to let something just just build up and and let somebody let something faster it's like well if if you've if you've been wrong and you don't ever try to to clear that up if you don't ever try to take care of that you know the devil stays right there and it always plays in your mind with that one thought and he will always hinder you with that and you know and the thing is is if if your brother or sister has a has a all again you and whether whether you done anything wrong or not I always appreciate brother brother Dale always saying you know he said if you ever come to me and you got a problem he said I'll apologize whether I done anything wrong or not right why because you know it's just easier to do that and you know it's like well I'm sorry if if I if I offended you in some way then you know what I don't mind taking care of that because you know what it it'll it'll help me and you and then you know we can we can have communion with with God because as long as there's something that lays there that's always going to be a problem you're never going to get beyond that point that's always going to be someplace that's going to hinder you but you know if we if we know how to he said if you and this is from faith is our Victory he says he said oh you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality to it he said if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts and ups and downs and frustrations and there's something down in you that's telling you that there's somewhere that you can overcome that and we'll have the let the musicians come on come forward he says why don't he said why do you float around then from church to church and from place to place he said just deal kneel down till you strike heaven and I said last night go beyond the sound barriers then you'll have a purpose in life you'll have a purpose in belonging to the church you have a purpose in being baptized you'll have a purpose in what you're seeking for so if you if you have something and and you fellowship with God and you know if if we have fellowship with God then you know he will bring to our to our minds because I always want to be right in everything that I do Lord if there's something wrong if I'm wrong Lord I Want to Be Right am and Lord you show me where I'm wrong yes what I need to do and if somebody comes and tells me then I want to I want to receive that in the right attitude I want to have the right Spirit about it whether I agree with it or not that's that's beside the point but I want to have the right spirit and receive it and clear that up so that our fellowship that our communion with God is Not hindered amen because you know what if you and I work together and have the correct communion with God and with each other then you know what the whole church will be blessed it blesses it blesses everybody and there's no hindrance God bless you this [Applause] morning
