[0:00] I'm gonna put on the
[0:02] the thing because I think you can hear
[0:04] me anyway so yeah
[0:08] all right
[0:10] all right
[0:12] if you turn that one off
[0:16] what the heater
[0:27] change what I have to go through just to
[0:30] get started welcome back anyway
[0:32] they didn't
[0:34] this didn't happen the last three
[0:36] Sundays
[0:40] good to be
[0:42] here yes the unique was reading Isaiah
[0:47] yeah he was reading Isaiah yeah
[0:52] and who has believed that report but it
[0:54] also goes along with
[0:56] it goes along with bearing song
[1:00] where he pierced my hands and my feet
[1:02] brother Brown used that several times
[1:04] but people not understanding what was
[1:06] going on
[1:07] but it took somebody that said
[1:09] been to Calgary which Peter I mean
[1:12] Philip had not been to Calgary but if
[1:13] you're born again you've been to Calgary
[1:15] that's right so and you understand what
[1:17] Calvary is so it took somebody with some
[1:19] understanding to tell that Ethiopian
[1:21] eunuch what was going on so
[1:24] uh if you got your Bibles turn back when
[1:26] you turn a second Peter we can read it
[1:28] right here because we got it on on the
[1:30] screen
[1:31] we kind of got all this where we can put
[1:34] it together now and
[1:36] and uh I can't I will use my iPad today
[1:38] I promise I've been using it out in the
[1:40] in the field so I hadn't been thanking
[1:43] everybody I've been thinking Everett
[1:44] been telling where it came from so
[1:46] so um
[1:48] thank you for uh again for getting it
[1:50] for me and I just don't have the little
[1:52] thingy that that I can use my iPad and
[1:55] it'll put it on screen yet but I will um
[1:57] I will purchase that just as soon as I
[2:00] can so but we're going to do it with the
[2:02] with a little one today so we're we're
[2:05] gonna go and
[2:07] going into patience I think temperance
[2:10] we pretty much got that covered because
[2:12] Temperance is out of control your temper
[2:13] how do not speak ill of somebody
[2:17] um we still need to work on all these
[2:20] things it's not something that you come
[2:21] to a uh a period on any of these it's
[2:25] always a comma it's a comma and we do
[2:29] these things and we add to our faith
[2:31] virtue and The Virtue knowledge it's
[2:32] always a continuous adding so but we
[2:36] have to come to a place though that that
[2:38] the Lord will show you that you do have
[2:40] Temperance that that what used to bother
[2:42] you doesn't bother you anymore well then
[2:44] praise God for that
[2:46] that's right you know praise God for
[2:47] those things when you come to him uh
[2:49] Brother Francis you can be in it you can
[2:51] know where you're at with God at any
[2:53] moment now that's your problem if you
[2:55] don't because if you don't you're not
[2:56] born again that's right if you're born
[2:58] again you'll see how God will take you
[3:00] from here to here to here to here and
[3:04] God's one is doing it not you that's
[3:06] right
[3:06] but if you're not born again then you're
[3:08] just you're believing unto that's okay
[3:10] you can be justified you can be
[3:11] Sanctified and you can have part of
[3:14] these because brother Brown said so
[3:15] there's people in the world not even
[3:17] born again that has some of these
[3:18] virtues but remember what we said before
[3:21] they're human virtues they're at virtue
[3:23] because of the genetic makeup of that
[3:25] family their genetic makeup of a family
[3:27] down in guildsville uh I'll not call
[3:30] their name but we're kin to them
[3:32] and thank God on the other side not on
[3:34] the Dale side we got enough temper
[3:36] herself
[3:37] but the whole the whole
[3:40] um Clan or the whole
[3:42] family is known to be violent
[3:46] cursing and beating each other up
[3:49] but they're known for that why because
[3:51] it came down through
[3:54] the genetic makeup
[3:55] and how that uh you know you see brother
[3:58] Brown he tells he tells stories about
[4:00] that
[4:01] that this this kid is because
[4:04] of something that happened because of
[4:05] the grandmother or the great grandfather
[4:07] or something happened way back Yonder
[4:09] right and then he come down through the
[4:11] generations and It produced like a
[4:12] redheaded child you have a redheaded
[4:14] child there's no redheaded children but
[4:16] if you check back four generations there
[4:17] was a redheaded in-law came in there you
[4:20] know married into the family and there's
[4:22] that g there's that Gene laying there
[4:24] and uh it comes to life like uh
[4:28] uh especially in the animal kingdom like
[4:31] deer with with uh you call a deer that
[4:35] looks
[4:36] all brown he's got a certain genetic
[4:38] makeup but there's some that are brown
[4:40] with white spots called pie ball well it
[4:42] takes a splitting of a gene from a
[4:44] mother and a father to make that well
[4:46] that's the same way with us we're just
[4:48] this is animal skin
[4:50] we're just animals
[4:52] uh we're no more than an animal if we're
[4:54] not born again we because of our because
[4:57] of the what God put that two seven man
[4:59] there to till the ground for brother
[5:01] Brown said that was animal
[5:03] one guy that was an animal and that's
[5:05] the same way with us so in these virtues
[5:07] you can have a certain amount of these
[5:09] virtues and not be born again
[5:12] um
[5:13] you can have patience we've seen people
[5:15] have patience they weren't even born
[5:17] again it was just part of their part of
[5:18] their makeup
[5:20] but remember this is Godly Faith Godly
[5:24] virtue Godly knowledge Godly Temperance
[5:27] Godly Godly patience
[5:30] so The Godly Temperance that we should
[5:32] have is is not to speak evil when spoken
[5:35] up
[5:37] not to rile up when you're riled against
[5:39] look at Jesus Christ he he had the
[5:42] greatest Temperance he showed one time
[5:45] as driving the people out of the
[5:48] out of the temple but
[5:50] of course he went and died for those
[5:51] same people so he had patience he had
[5:53] Temperance to to you know I mean if I
[5:56] was him if I was him and I walked in
[6:00] that Temple and they would berating me
[6:01] and calling me illegitimate and all that
[6:03] stuff I probably got a little worse than
[6:04] he did you understand what I mean every
[6:06] day he had to he had that question
[6:09] hanging over him in the Pharisees of
[6:11] course they had nothing in their Linens
[6:13] to to bother them so they were always
[6:15] berating him you know well sometimes he
[6:17] rubs on that nerve a little bit you know
[6:19] so
[6:21] but that's why Jesus is the example
[6:23] he never riled back when he was on a
[6:25] cross just like when we read there when
[6:27] he was on the cross he never Ronald he
[6:30] never remodeled back he never he never
[6:32] said father kill him all he said forgive
[6:33] him until they know not what they do I
[6:36] have a question about Temperance do you
[6:39] think and I'm serious here and Dad I
[6:43] don't throw plates and that kind of
[6:46] stuff I don't do that but I punch my
[6:49] teeth a lot
[6:51] after seeing him apart
[6:55] remember you can't help thinking bad
[6:57] thoughts either that's right you can't
[6:59] help
[7:00] but you know what the best thing to do
[7:02] is if you do think that said Lord
[7:03] forgive me and if those people are not
[7:06] safe save the people because they
[7:08] wouldn't do it if they were Christians
[7:10] they wouldn't do that they wouldn't do
[7:12] that to you if they were Christian
[7:13] but grit in your teeth I don't
[7:17] we do it to our children
[7:20] I'd like to bite my head off sometimes
[7:24] it would leave a bloody mess and I don't
[7:27] want to clean it up
[7:29] so but see that's where I need more
[7:32] Temperance but I do have more Temperance
[7:33] toward them than I used to
[7:35] best thing to do just not say anything
[7:37] that's right pray for him there's not
[7:39] listen
[7:41] nothing out of your mouth is going to
[7:43] save your children
[7:44] except prayer that's right nothing out
[7:48] of your mouth you know mama she bless
[7:50] her heart she's sitting here now so
[7:52] she's sitting here as a witness she used
[7:54] to every time get on the phone why don't
[7:55] you know at church you need to be Church
[7:57] you know you need a big church that
[7:58] honestly didn't do any good
[8:00] but Daddy hardly never said anything why
[8:03] he had a resolve and a Temperance and a
[8:05] patience like we're going to talk about
[8:06] today he got a patience to know that God
[8:08] said it and he's going to do it and
[8:09] that's it
[8:11] we'll see if we get to it in time Noah
[8:14] had to wait a hundred and twenty years
[8:21] 120 years and you know what God went and
[8:24] finished trying his patience
[8:27] he put him in the ark shut the door and
[8:30] had to wait seven more days
[8:33] with nothing
[8:36] no scientific evidence
[8:38] no Weather Channel which they messed up
[8:41] ask brother Joe and brother Bob
[8:46] and whoever else was out there in it
[8:49] wow
[8:52] I mean maybe uh it's like brother Joe
[8:55] you know what that storm
[8:57] and I don't know if anybody helped you
[8:59] or not but that storm
[9:01] that storm could have been predestinated
[9:04] by God and it was
[9:06] just so that somebody could help brother
[9:08] Joe and get eternalized yeah that's just
[9:10] one person here not just one person here
[9:12] I'm not talking about Christians all
[9:13] around the world that it happens to but
[9:15] we just had it happen brother Joe
[9:16] somebody brought him a sandwich somebody
[9:18] brought him a honey bun somebody brought
[9:19] him coffee somebody offered help well
[9:21] guess what
[9:23] yeah in the end
[9:26] the Bible said I'll not forget it here
[9:28] right or there right so brother Joe can
[9:31] stand up one day and say uh so-and-so
[9:34] help me yeah
[9:36] and God won't forget it
[9:38] so you see there
[9:40] and somebody who could have helped you I
[9:41] don't know but brother Joe's telling us
[9:42] last night but but people just having
[9:45] patience at that time yeah now can you
[9:48] imagine
[9:50] being stuck on 285
[9:52] for a day and a half
[9:54] I can't stand it for 15 or 20 minutes
[9:57] and Bob being on the bus for eight hours
[10:02] and I'm sure they were all Christians
[10:04] and sat there and was really nice
[10:07] we won't talk about that
[10:11] same way with you brother Joe I'm sure
[10:14] that CB radio was full of bleep bleep
[10:16] from bleep bleep right I understand yes
[10:19] sir anyway uh if you've seen everyone
[10:21] something happens people get together
[10:23] and help each other but the rest of the
[10:24] time they followed them in there yeah
[10:27] right
[10:30] it depends on the situation when I saw
[10:33] that I thought man what's it going to be
[10:35] when we get out of here all right that's
[10:39] just a that's just a speck
[10:42] of what's going to happen all over this
[10:44] country when when this thing shuts down
[10:46] and maybe even before we leave here yeah
[10:49] we may have to go through some
[10:50] tribulations of of uh Sleeping in a
[10:53] church or sleeping in a car or
[10:57] you never know maybe God's preparing US
[10:59] foreign
[11:01] walked two hours in the snow to get home
[11:04] and and you can tell your children it
[11:06] was uphill
[11:08] both ways and you can tell them that it
[11:12] was you know this high if you want them
[11:14] and that's fine
[11:15] you know the old story is with what we
[11:17] used to watch School two miles every day
[11:19] at school and two feet of snow it was
[11:21] uphill both ways so kind of stretching
[11:24] the truth a little bit but these
[11:25] brothers went through something that
[11:26] maybe tried their patients a little bit
[11:28] maybe tried their Temperance a little
[11:30] bit
[11:30] mm-hmm came through yeah
[11:34] you know brother Joe came to her brother
[11:37] Joe's Meat calm guy and and Bobby is too
[11:40] and it may have been different with me
[11:43] may have been different than me I mean
[11:45] Danny would have probably
[11:47] commandeered a car somewhere
[12:00] but you see there there's where
[12:05] you know it's it's just things in your
[12:08] life but you know what got to do that to
[12:10] show you and then what the prophet said
[12:11] he'll do it to show you where you're at
[12:15] and you know he said if you fail the
[12:16] test
[12:17] it's just a redo you designed to do it
[12:19] over again so Bob and and brother Joe
[12:22] and brother Bob past it so Hallelujah
[12:24] they won't have to get stuck in traffic
[12:25] anymore for eight hours or 12 hours or
[12:27] or brother Joe's 30 something 20
[12:30] something hours that leave
[12:32] bless his heart
[12:34] almost two days straight I got a little
[12:37] helicopter for Christmas but I couldn't
[12:39] pick you up with that place I was
[12:40] talking about helicoptering in and
[12:42] picking you up but let's get back but
[12:43] this is you know this is life lessons
[12:45] this is what we go through this is an
[12:46] everyday thing that we go through and
[12:49] and we stand it into Walmart and and
[12:51] line and and you got screaming babies
[12:53] behind you and you got people cursing in
[12:56] front of you that's right what are you
[12:57] gonna do about it you're going to get
[12:59] all upset you're going to get all
[13:00] frustrated and all you need to have
[13:02] patience you need to have Temperance you
[13:03] need to say God they just don't know you
[13:05] they just don't know you like I know you
[13:08] and then just turn it into a thanks
[13:09] right turn it into a thank you God that
[13:12] that you know and don't say like the
[13:14] Pharisees don't be the way like this
[13:15] because there's a fine line don't say
[13:17] I'm glad I'm not like that guy all right
[13:19] because you know what though if without
[13:22] the new birth you'd be just like that
[13:23] guy okay so you praise God at least he's
[13:27] showing you that you got the new birth
[13:28] that's right and that you're acting
[13:30] different but don't ever it's hard not
[13:32] okay but don't ever look down on people
[13:35] because you were there at one time
[13:36] before that's right and and God looks at
[13:39] all the same through the blood remember
[13:40] he only hears our Voice through the
[13:42] blood so he sees everybody the same
[13:45] Sinners and Saints through the blood but
[13:47] thank God he's given us a way of escape
[13:49] a way to get out of here a way to to
[13:51] pull us out of this junk and that's what
[13:54] he's doing and I've said it many times
[13:55] before Satan went into God's perfect
[13:57] Eden and messed it up now God's come
[13:59] down into Satan's perfect Eden and
[14:01] messing it up
[14:03] because I don't know how to handle you
[14:04] they won't know how to handle brother
[14:05] Bob or or brother Joe
[14:08] if uh if they really were to sit down
[14:11] and analyze 30 people on a bus and
[14:13] here's one guy that's just as calm as he
[14:15] could be maybe reading his Bible maybe
[14:17] let what you know maybe had your iPad
[14:20] maybe you had your iPhone maybe you had
[14:21] something you listen to a sermon and
[14:23] everybody else around him is cursing
[14:24] throwing stuff and pitching a fit and I
[14:27] know the truck drivers work brother
[14:29] Jones they're pretty rough people you
[14:30] know it's that's a tough job I I haven't
[14:32] been around him a lot but but you're
[14:34] sitting there in in the newscasters
[14:36] going well there's 35 people that's
[14:38] pitching the fan pulling their hair out
[14:40] but there's one guy sitting here we
[14:41] don't know what this guy's doing
[14:44] he may be a maniac he may be fixing to
[14:46] do something
[14:47] but he's sitting here different well see
[14:49] that's the world that's the testimony to
[14:51] the world maybe somebody that Bob never
[14:54] knew though was sitting in the back of
[14:56] that bus and was inspired right
[15:00] inspired by what he was doing or not
[15:03] doing same way with brother Joe you know
[15:05] truck driver usually gets out kicking
[15:07] tires gussing and everything else and
[15:09] there's brother Joe saying oh well it's
[15:10] okay everything will be all right
[15:12] see maybe they inspired something same
[15:15] way with you and I that's what I keep
[15:17] telling you people are watching you
[15:19] whether you know they're watching you or
[15:21] not that's right
[15:23] and can our actions convict this as a
[15:27] Christian
[15:28] do we have enough evidence
[15:31] right to convict this as a Christian
[15:35] because remember the people in Antioch
[15:37] acted like Christ so they begin to call
[15:39] them Christians that's where the
[15:41] Christian word came from was they became
[15:43] to act like Christ so they called them
[15:45] Christians in Antioch and Antioch was a
[15:48] very powerful church he had a huge
[15:49] amount of members 12.
[15:51] there are 12 people in that church but
[15:54] brother Brown said that was the most
[15:55] powerful Church in the first age so so
[15:58] it's not the it's not the quantity it's
[16:00] the quality of the quantity right that's
[16:03] why I said I'd rather have 20 that's got
[16:05] the new birth and they have 100 that
[16:06] didn't
[16:08] that's right because God can move
[16:10] through that twenty group of 20 people
[16:12] but let's start right here with patience
[16:14] everybody okay with Temperance
[16:15] Temperance is gonna we must not be off
[16:17] the temperance yet
[16:20] because I have to respect my boss again
[16:24] because he was trying to hold me till 4
[16:25] 30 and I was not happy so the school is
[16:29] calling me to try and come and get the
[16:31] kids and they took me two and a half
[16:33] hours and I was calling him the whole
[16:34] time but he was trying to hold me at the
[16:36] office so I need to really respect him
[16:39] again so you're praying for that okay
[16:41] I'm not quite okay we'll say that match
[16:45] but did you react like all the other
[16:47] employees react no actually attention
[16:49] but nice and I said you know what the
[16:50] school said this right we didn't get to
[16:52] get out and then after 2 30 and then I
[16:55] emailed him then I said you know
[16:56] you don't believe the school's calling
[16:58] me so
[17:00] it you know
[17:03] this is truly brother brother Keith Reed
[17:05] he hit the nail right on the head these
[17:07] are the trials of life
[17:09] these these versions show you through
[17:13] the trials of Life they'll show you no
[17:14] other way
[17:16] except through the trials of your
[17:17] individual life that's the only way
[17:19] brother Dale can preach patients for a
[17:21] hundred years and unless you get
[17:23] um unless you get an experience of
[17:25] patience
[17:26] just somebody speaking to somebody
[17:29] but you got experience I I I've been
[17:32] reading Oneness with God and it's a real
[17:34] good sermon and we're gonna we're gonna
[17:35] read some out of it this afternoon
[17:37] but brother Brown said it comes down to
[17:40] an individual Affair that's right you
[17:42] and God not you and the prophet and God
[17:44] not you in the pastor and God not you in
[17:46] the preacher and God it's you and not
[17:48] you and your husband and God or you and
[17:49] your wife and God or you and your kids
[17:50] and God he said it's you and God Alone
[17:53] that's it that's what it comes down to
[17:55] comes down now you've got to have a
[17:57] five-fold Ministry to get you to that
[17:58] spot right that's right you got to have
[18:00] a Godly husband and a Godly wife to get
[18:01] you to that spot but when it comes down
[18:04] to it God's Not Gonna Take me because
[18:06] Jim's Sanctified or filled with a Holy
[18:08] Ghost
[18:09] he's gonna take me because I am right
[18:11] and because she's got patience and I
[18:13] don't that don't mean I got patience uh
[18:16] let me put it this way we don't have
[18:18] virtues by association that's right you
[18:21] understand what I mean we don't have
[18:23] virtues by association that's right uh
[18:25] we have virtues by individuals brother
[18:27] Graham said it's an individual affair
[18:28] with God so it's an individual I can't
[18:31] tell you whether you got Temperance or
[18:33] not God's gonna show you if you if you
[18:35] get to a place to where you say God I
[18:38] don't know if I got
[18:39] whatever act knowledge temperance then
[18:43] he's obligated to put somebody there or
[18:45] put a situation in front of you to prove
[18:48] whether you've got patience or
[18:49] Temperance or whatever and you know what
[18:51] we're all at WIP which is a work in
[18:53] progress you know for all the work in
[18:55] progress that's right it's not we're not
[18:57] complete until that even after The
[18:59] Headstone comes
[19:01] headstone came to brother brown right he
[19:04] was sealed and capped off and adopted
[19:06] son of God and he still had problems he
[19:08] died in car wreck I mean he was he was
[19:10] fussing with his wife
[19:12] so it's what Sarah said he was fussing
[19:14] with his wife before they had to wreck
[19:16] so we're not immune to human nature I
[19:19] want us to see that but but we've got to
[19:21] see that if you've got Godly Temperance
[19:23] it'll show you somewhere
[19:25] if you've got Godly patience it'll show
[19:27] you somewhere not that you just got
[19:28] patience that's right you got to have
[19:30] Godly patients that's right God's Gonna
[19:32] what God's gonna have to do is he's
[19:33] going to connect it to the word or he's
[19:35] going to connect it to something in your
[19:37] life that's going to speak back to you
[19:38] that's what I want you to see in this
[19:40] whole thing I want God to speak back to
[19:42] you doesn't matter how much I understand
[19:43] here and I speak 15 or 20 many sermons
[19:47] on patience but until God shows you you
[19:50] got patience I can't show you you got
[19:52] patience now all I can do is is help you
[19:55] fight the devil when he comes and says
[19:57] you don't got patience I tell you this
[19:59] is what patience is and then you've got
[20:01] to connect to that same thing with a
[20:02] preacher upstairs
[20:04] a preacher can't give you a revelation
[20:06] only God can give you a revelation
[20:08] that's right now if the brother says
[20:10] something
[20:11] to Enlighten you or to take the scales
[20:14] off your eyes yes then that brother
[20:16] helped you but it was God that showed
[20:18] you something what it was is we we got
[20:20] the devil out of the way
[20:22] we don't get the devil out of the way
[20:23] and give you an Avenue so that you can
[20:25] talk to God all right because look at
[20:27] look at Paul
[20:29] Paul was smitting it on the road to
[20:31] Damascus
[20:32] right
[20:33] he had to find ananias somebody that
[20:36] already had the Holy Ghost
[20:39] now I don't know if Paul had natural
[20:41] scales on his eyes because the Bible
[20:43] says the scales came off his eyes but I
[20:45] just believe he came back to where he
[20:46] can under because seeing his
[20:48] understanding exactly you know seeing
[20:50] his understanding Paul knew there was an
[20:52] understanding number one that that must
[20:54] have been a deity must be in God because
[20:56] he called him Lord but that didn't save
[20:58] him
[20:59] uh it's one I want to do I learned a
[21:01] little bit about brother Dale talking
[21:03] about the seed well he Paul was the seed
[21:05] of God he should have been quickened
[21:06] right there because there was Jesus
[21:07] talking to him but he wasn't he had to
[21:10] go find somebody right God had to say go
[21:13] find this Prophet because remember let
[21:15] me tell you something else about ananias
[21:17] didn't want to go yeah that's right
[21:19] that's right that's right yeah now he
[21:21] was born again Christian right
[21:24] should have had these virtues working in
[21:25] his life a little brotherly kindness but
[21:28] he said are you sure
[21:31] that man Saul
[21:34] why because Saul had a reputation and he
[21:37] was having a nice gun you sure Lord are
[21:39] you sure you want me to go down there
[21:41] because remember he was putting him to
[21:43] death he was he was causing them to
[21:45] blaspheme he was actually persecuting
[21:47] the Christian people and here ananas has
[21:50] got to go
[21:52] and not just talk to him
[21:54] remember the Holy Ghost did you lay
[21:56] hands on him right oh my don't lay hands
[21:58] on a Jew
[22:00] basically Paul or salt
[22:02] but he had to go that seed had to be
[22:04] quickened by ananias because he had the
[22:07] word in him Paul didn't have the word in
[22:09] him Paul heard the word Paul knew the
[22:12] word but it wasn't quick unto it right
[22:14] so he had to receive the Holy Ghost
[22:16] and then the scales fell back well
[22:18] that's what's got to happen to you and I
[22:19] today in listening anywhere the scales
[22:22] have got to be pulled back just enough
[22:24] where you can see a little bit of God
[22:25] you know I'm gonna see the whole sermon
[22:29] see parts of it any sermon but the parts
[22:32] you need is when you go up there you say
[22:34] God give me my part for today
[22:36] okay give me my part for today
[22:39] and if it's the whole portion give it to
[22:41] me but he don't dump it all on you at
[22:42] one time you know better than that
[22:44] because we can't stand it but he'll let
[22:46] us know and we're not even going to get
[22:47] into patients
[22:51] but let's read the scripture and get
[22:54] when we can start on it
[22:56] all right second Peter 1 verse three
[23:02] according as his divine power has given
[23:04] unto us all things that pertains unto
[23:07] life and godliness remember we started
[23:09] this before life
[23:10] that's what we just went through right
[23:12] here the life and godliness because we
[23:15] gotta act like God too through the
[23:16] knowledge of him that have called us to
[23:18] glory and virtue whereby are giving to
[23:21] us exceeding great and precious promises
[23:22] that by these you might be partakers of
[23:25] a divine nature have an escape the
[23:27] corruption that is in world through lust
[23:29] and besides this giving all diligence
[23:31] add to your faith virtue to Virtue
[23:33] knowledge and all these Temperance
[23:35] Temperance patience and to patience
[23:38] godliness now the Greek Lexicon on
[23:41] patience I like this watch this right
[23:43] here
[23:44] this is what the Greek Mexican talks
[23:46] about watch
[23:47] steadfast look down at number one
[23:51] constancy
[23:53] endurance
[23:55] in the New Testament the characteristics
[23:57] of a man do you know the word patience
[23:59] is not in the Old Testament
[24:04] I looked it up this morning it's 33
[24:07] times the word patience but it's all in
[24:09] the New Testament starting from Matthew
[24:12] to Revelation it is not in the Old
[24:15] Testament
[24:17] um now some of them did have patience
[24:18] but some of them didn't there's a lot of
[24:21] violence a lot of violence in the Old
[24:23] Testament so there was there was just a
[24:25] little bit of God's virtue that's why
[24:26] nobody was born again and I wish people
[24:28] could see that it's just kind of plain
[24:30] as a nose on your face that uh and we'll
[24:32] talk about it today because we're gonna
[24:34] we're gonna speak on the Journey of that
[24:35] Genesis 1 26 we're going to bring him
[24:37] out of Genesis and bring it right up
[24:38] today so he was in the Old Testament
[24:44] the Genesis one man you were you were
[24:46] there brother Brown tells you you were
[24:48] there with Moses you were there with
[24:50] this when you but you were there and the
[24:51] anointing that they had not as an
[24:53] indwelling not as the they couldn't be
[24:55] your brother because you you got the new
[24:57] birth and Moses Moses didn't have a new
[24:59] birth all right
[25:01] and New Testament characteristics of a
[25:03] man who has not swerved from his
[25:05] deliberate purpose and is loyalty to
[25:08] Faith and piety by even the greatest
[25:10] trials what we just talked about and
[25:13] sufferings
[25:14] a patient steadfast and right here's a
[25:16] good one right here waiting for
[25:20] now I like these last words enduring
[25:23] sustaining
[25:25] and perseverance
[25:27] that's what patience is
[25:29] you take patience you say well that's uh
[25:35] that's all but there's another word that
[25:37] comes out
[25:39] the first part of in Matthew it talks
[25:42] about
[25:43] having patience
[25:46] but not as being like a virtue so this
[25:48] is the this is the definition of it but
[25:51] it's almost the same
[25:53] bear long suffer long long you see what
[25:56] that says not just in a moment patience
[25:58] is a enduring a long journey patience is
[26:01] a journey
[26:03] patiently endured to be of long Spirit
[26:06] not to lose heart
[26:08] right to persevere patiently and bravely
[26:12] in enduring misfortunes and troubles
[26:15] well brother Joe and brother Bob went
[26:17] through Tuesday and on into Wednesday
[26:21] and Thursday probably for brother Joe
[26:24] to be patient in bearing the offenses
[26:26] and injuries of others
[26:30] hmm to be mild and slow to punish
[26:34] now here in Luke it says and you shall
[26:36] be hated of all men for my name's sake
[26:38] but there shall not a hair of your head
[26:41] perish
[26:42] believe that why because in your
[26:45] patience
[26:46] possessing your soul
[26:48] in your patience Book of Luke in your in
[26:51] your patience
[26:52] possess you
[26:54] your soul Romans 5 1 therefore being
[26:56] justified by faith we have peace with
[26:59] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[27:01] whom also we have access by faith into
[27:03] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[27:06] in Hope of the glory of God and not only
[27:08] so but we glory in tribulations also
[27:11] knowing that tribulation worketh
[27:14] patience he's not finished
[27:17] watch this right here
[27:19] and patience experience
[27:21] and experience hope so patience has a a
[27:26] few steps to it
[27:27] uh Temperance is being temperate but
[27:30] when you keep going up the statue of a
[27:31] perfect man it gets more narrow but what
[27:34] it does it compacts more and it shows
[27:36] that there's more to do it because
[27:38] tribulation work with patients there is
[27:40] no way you can show patients without
[27:43] having tribulation
[27:46] that's like brother Clark said the other
[27:48] day and he he looked up the definition
[27:49] of of happiness
[27:52] and on down further in in the word
[27:54] happiness it says sorrow
[27:57] is a part of happiness
[27:59] because you can't be happy
[28:02] if you hadn't been sorrowful or sorry if
[28:06] you hadn't went through
[28:09] tribulation
[28:11] brother Joe brother Bob today if you
[28:13] hadn't went through that tribulation you
[28:15] wouldn't have known you had that much
[28:16] patience
[28:18] okay
[28:20] but patience brings what experience
[28:23] and experience hope all right
[28:26] so now we know that
[28:29] one thing's for sure if it starts
[28:31] snowing in the middle of the week
[28:32] anymore
[28:33] that brother Joe and brother Bob is
[28:36] going to either try to hurry home or
[28:38] they're going to say well we got to do
[28:39] her this again that's right one of the
[28:41] two
[28:43] and I'm sure they're calling for snow
[28:45] Friday so they're going to probably pull
[28:47] the trigger real quick and nothing will
[28:49] happen maybe
[28:50] so but anyway that's just the world that
[28:52] we live in but we go through these
[28:53] things
[28:54] we go through these things we have to
[28:56] experience them watch this right here in
[28:58] Hebrews 6. and we'll finish right here
[29:01] and we desire that every one of you do
[29:03] show the same diligence to the full
[29:05] Assurance of Hope unto the end so
[29:08] patience is enduring to the end
[29:11] that ye be not slothful but followers of
[29:14] them who through faith and patience
[29:17] inherit the promises
[29:19] for when God made promise to Abraham
[29:22] because he could swear by no greater he
[29:24] swear by himself now what about Abraham
[29:27] without the new birth
[29:29] saying surely blessing I will bless them
[29:31] multiplying I will multiply them so ask
[29:34] and so after that he had patiently
[29:37] endured
[29:38] he obtained the promise
[29:41] now Abraham didn't get the promise right
[29:43] off the bat right
[29:46] it looked worse as he got older
[29:50] but remember Abraham is the one that
[29:53] doesn't look at circumstances
[29:55] that's our problem we look at too many
[29:56] circumstances and I know we all get
[29:58] caught up in circumstances
[30:00] um
[30:01] but you know we we got to get out of
[30:03] that
[30:04] we're foreseen we also are
[30:06] compassionless what's this this is
[30:07] Hebrews 12 1. we're foreseen we also are
[30:10] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[30:12] witness let us lay aside every weight in
[30:14] the Sin which does so easily beset us
[30:16] and let us run with patience to race
[30:19] that is set before us let's continue
[30:22] let's get the scriptures and then we'll
[30:23] then we'll read what brother Brown says
[30:25] about it James 1. my brother encountered
[30:27] all joy when you fall into temptation
[30:29] count it what
[30:31] huh Joy
[30:35] Joy yes
[30:37] that was the last thing in bottom of
[30:39] mine Tuesday
[30:44] right that's right that's the last thing
[30:46] in his mind was Joy but today he and
[30:50] brother Bob and he and brother uh Joe
[30:52] were joyful amen right amen
[30:56] that made it through
[30:58] counted on Joy when you fall into
[31:00] diver's Temptations knowing this that
[31:03] the trying of your faith worketh
[31:05] patience
[31:07] but let patience have her perfect work
[31:10] that you may be perfect and entire
[31:13] wanting nothing
[31:16] wanting nothing
[31:20] James five and seven be patient
[31:22] therefore Brethren unto the coming of
[31:24] the Lord behold the husband and waiteth
[31:26] that's patience for the precious fruit

[31:42] and latter rain be ye also patient

[31:58] brethren to prophets who have spoken in
[32:00] the name of the Lord for an example of
[32:01] suffering Affliction and of patience
[32:03] behold we count them happy which endure
[32:06] you have heard of the patience of Job
[32:08] and have seen the end of the Lord that
[32:09] the Lord is very pitiful and of tender
[32:11] Mercy next Sunday we'll start on what
[32:13] brother Brown talks about the Statue of
[32:16] perfect man so Lord bless you take these
[32:18] scriptures and apply them to your life
