========================================

now we're talking on the statue of a perfect man and that's what sunday's could have been for the past four times four sundays and this will be number five and we're still just on the foundation of faith all right and we haven't got out of that because just in a review there's one thing we got to understand as the bride of jesus christ we got to realize one we were lost we didn't just come in the message and get saved right right you don't just come in the message and it's an automatic process no you this is the worst place to be if you're not right all right so and that this here is anti-word this out here because it was born against the word the word was not the word did not make this flesh my mom and daddy made this flesh okay jesus was the word made flesh difference right okay he was without sin you and i were born anti-word totally against the way the word was supposed to be all right right so and that doesn't that that doesn't it's like brother branham said it it's a bad thing but god didn't leave us there that's right he wanted to redeem us he don't want us to try to redeem ourselves okay so we're born anti-word well even when we're born again we have the death of the old nature not the old soul dies we're not into the two soul thing but the nature of that soul was burned out just like the earth brother around him in the future homie really if you'll read the future home to me i'd rather somebody read the future home to get a little understanding than to read any other book because he goes all the way through it starts with a journey of a christian and goes all the way through because remember you and i god in isaiah 40 said that this world was made and it was made to be inhabited now when god says that that's eternal so he's going to have some eternal people living on the earth and you and i come out of that earth which was cursed in the garden god didn't curse adam he cursed the ground that he came out from so everything that was in the earth was cursed that's why cain's sacrifice couldn't be accepted it came from the earth it was cursed it was the cursed earth so but then remember christ come to make a way back we're buried in corruption anti-word raised in incorruption now you and i are dead in christ already by the new birth inside so we are going to make manifest inside but now memory reason conscious effects and imagination that's not born again that's not born again you still have evil thoughts yeah that's right we have your memory of the old things you used to do so let's just get on through memory reason conscious face and imagination all those things we love things we shouldn't love that's right okay so that is a carnal nature still of man but now god made a provision brother brown said almost verbatim he said somehow god comes down through that preach it brother you talking to me but somehow god comes down through all that and gives you the new birth well then what happens brother branham preached what thinking man's filter the filter the flues got stopped up adam didn't have a problem talking to god until his flush got stopped up now that's what we got to come back to is the restoration of you and i being able to talk to god face to face without condemnation all right that's what we've got to come back to that's the part that we that we are we fell from and that's the part that we got to come back to everybody understand that yes that's very simple basic you must be born again but brother adam takes the earth and he says now the bible says it's a new heaven and a new earth right old things are passed away you bring it to this all things have become new that doesn't mean that you physically die and god brings a new person you're you when you were born and you were given a body spirit and a soul that's a unit god doesn't separate that he doesn't but like brother brown said i don't believe in transmigration of souls in other words put assault your soul over somewhere else no when you die your soul goes in the sixth dimension your body goes to the grave spirit goes back to god who gave it everybody understand that so i'm trying to delay this foundation of faith because we got to realize number one that we are we have still a carnal nature come on people you see these babies yes we do that's proof enough we're still living in a carnal nature that's not god's perfect will but that's his permissive will to procreate okay but that wasn't his perfect will his perfect will was spoken word children just like you and i can i finish my fault okay just because you and i were one day you know this sunday school class only had about six people in it at one time this church only had about 15 people in it at one time that's right well now freedom central was probably one of the youngest ones to come she where was she 20 years ago where was she 15 years ago or was she three years ago i'm just using for an example she wasn't here there was a time when joshua dale was not here he was in me but he wasn't here where we can see because he was wasn't fully manifested all right so then here comes freedom she appears spiritual multiplication right brother dale is preaching the spiritual seed word of the god of god light was supposed to have happened and then we as children now being born of god on the inside are sealed done just like we said just like we said last week we were talking about the city about living in the city and outside the city if you're born again if you were born again this morning and you die in a car wreck going home you're just as eternal as almighty god because one speck of eternal life is eternal life okay the ocean is huge one little tablespoon has got everything in it that that ocean you can say you've got all of the oceans potentially that's right potentially that's why in ephesians it said you have the earnest of your inheritance because the full inheritance is not this thing being corrupt full inheritance is this thing back to like the garden of eden where you can talk to god face to face right okay now what's your question or comment yeah i happen to think this will never be saved our flesh what will happen for us to take that rapture is it that the faith in us will quicken this that's right romans 8 says the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead if it dwell in you that would be word if right that it will also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwells in you see not everybody is not going to be quickened at the resurrection no this is not going to be a general resurrection coming up this is going to be a secret you're not going to walk out there and your brother tatum and sister tatum's laying side by side up here in lula the rapture takes place well if you go see it you missed it but if somebody wants to walk up and go well they're still in the grave that's why it's going to be a secret carrying away god don't have to dig the graves up to get the bodies out he just takes that soul that can walk through a wall the real person of robert tatum huh the real person of jesus christ remember he walked through walls and he even still had he had his flesh body he was glorified but brother tatum's soul is going to come back and pick up that body coming right back up out of the grave right and it's not going to disturb one little dust of of earth so it's not going to be the the resurrection that's what a lot of denominational people think you're going to walk out there in that whole hillside it's going to be like blossomed you know like caskets sticking up like no that's kind of macabre that's kind of like the world thinks of zombies you know here they come out of the ground you know you see this zombie thing there's a meaning behind that i'll get to that one day and i'll tell you what that means what the horse showed me that man let's see you in the office you're alive do i see you in the office working and you're alive and that's when they're right you're just gonna disappear now how about somebody like retro with the baby you should just leave the face baby go baby go all babies go to heaven and i do not believe that god would let that baby stay here or are you see they've got three kids i mean my what would be a god that would take the two parents and leave the three kids in an empty house that's right no they're going with you right but now when they come to age accountability 12 13 14 and they got to make their decision if they don't yeah they are going to stay here i was listening to questions and answers yesterday going to work brother brown they had that question said will my children be saved brother brown said if they're born again he said if they're not they won't he said that's just the way it is you can believe for your children and believe for your children and have faith for your children and i believe if you have real substance faith somehow they'll come it may be a deathbed confession you may never know it but that's fine ten seconds one second split second god saved my soul done right right right absolutely so so you know let's look at this as as a growth process as you and i mature up the statue of a perfect man but we all got to start as babies in christ that's right babbling babies romans 8 says we seem to receive the spirit of adoption will we cry father father out by father what we're going to wobble around we're going to stumble we're going to fall but remember what we said that little baby back there that brother louise little zoe she she's got everything she needs to drive a car right she will develop nothing else as far as externally she'll nothing else she's got everything she needs she might need a couple of uh stacks of papers to sit on to see over the steering wheel but she's got every faculty but brother louise is definitely if he does we're leaving hands her the keys today and says here zoey drive us home but potentially she can as she matures in god that's right in other words she's not have to grow another arm she doesn't have to grow another leg she just has to get some intelligence right knowledge temperance patience guidelines temperance we need we're still driving cars and we still need temperatures brother ray you should have plenty of temperatures because you don't drive pray for your wife that's what we're looking at here i want us to understand that that we're just not revelated just because we're in the seventh church age and we're revelated because we're up there where it says brotherly kindness we all start as babies right here faith it's a big old wide foundation that's why there's a lot to be said about it but you got to have number one a desire to want god brother brown said remember last sunday we read this um the quote before this where he's talking about pulling his wife inside of him you know he said that's the way we should be with christ we should want him so much that and then he continues on that he says that's the way it is with christ we've got to be so in love with him to when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit he didn't say a little bit he said a bit they don't shake you at all when you say god i got so-and-so and so-and-so just keeps quiet now zoe when she's a baby and she cries or eula we jump everybody we want to know what's wrong with that baby give it something give it something but now when that baby grows up to be about 10 years old and they still sit in a corner and cry because of nothing grow up kid i'll give you something to cry about and then we'll know what you're crying about okay um when when we see that the dead saints raised and among us would would the um the spiritual things that we have problems with be over well let me quote you what brother brown said he said until the change this is going to be sticky this is going to be sticky until the moment of the change now now kind of getting off the subject we need to get back down to baby faith but let me let me help you with this when those dead saints come out of the ground we're going to be right here a novice is not going to call the dead saints out of the ground that's right brother brown brought us the headstone message and this is headstone which is christ he's the only one he is we are not so big to where we say we're the resurrection but what we say out from us jesus said i am the resurrection and the life well there's not a number two resurrection he said i am but that i am is going to be so much in us here because we got these things working in our life so when we call the dead saints out of the ground you think it's going to bother us because i don't think like brodel i believe the same way when the dead saints come out of the ground you got 30 40 days bible says it didn't cross your eyes first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed and caught up and meet the lord in the air all right so the dead saints are going to come out of the ground first we're going to call them out by the message that we preach speak the position that we reach that's why i've always said this is not just believing the message there are steps to take and that's why if you'll look in ii kings when elijah was on mount carmel now there was the what that was the second coming of elijah we believe we saw the fourth coming of elijah right so it's the same spirit you take the second coming of elijah he goes to mount carmel and those false prophets preachers they get on top of the altar and by the time they're finished with it it's all tore down the bible says elijah builds the altar back that's what brother brown come to do he came to restore not bring us a different message he came to restore the message it was the original message and then once we got to that level or getting to that level he calmly preached the seals brought christ down to where we can unite with him okay so that is a process elijah had to put the altar back together then he poured water on it then he called god down he wasn't going to call the altar he wasn't going to call god down with the altar being all messed up that's right so he had to restore church order he had to restore our lives back to the position of the faith of the fathers down here the first church age at ephesus okay that's what we got to be restored back to don't don't start screaming we've got rapture and faith and we're here no that's baby faith that's just faith to say god i accept you as my savior and i want you to burn all the old me out and you come in and you're still going to make mistakes you're still going to do things wrong but you're not going to do like we've always said now at sanctification see that's down here before you even get faith that's right all right so the the cussing drinking smoking running around lying cheating oh sure we're all born liars which i wise every day if you don't tell it exactly the truth it's a lie that's right all right but down here at sanctification all that should already been gone that's not that's not talking god's going to burn it out at faith now he's starting a process to burn it out in sanctification water blood life all right water blood life then god starts right back over and you can still go to justification and sanctification is this higher walk brother brown said there's a higher form a mysterious part of justification that luther didn't know luther had just enough faith to get him right here smoked a pipe drank a beer sat in a pub but that was god because it was god on the inside he wasn't he was trying to work his way to the outside but he couldn't get outside because of man's traditions remember the capsule i told you about there's a lot of good medicine inside that capsule that's right but once you you got to put that capsule in an environment to dissolve and get out to do you any good all right so that's the same way god god didn't limit himself man limits god god never limits himself we limit what he can do for us and actually the same thing brother brown says on down a little bit further and we won't get to it today but he says we limit these things in other words not a verbal quote but he's saying we are the ones like daddy said hey he's been hitting this he did it last sunday you have nothing to do with god choosing you but once he chooses you your works is your faith expressed once he does choose you he's not going to lose you but if you can't if you can't get rid of that temper and you're going to keep it bless god i've just got it and that's the way it's going to be that's where you're going to stay and you're going to have to be purged by dying that's right these two things purges you the words while you're standing here are death because the bible says you're planted we planted brother tatum in corruption yeah his body was corrupt you could look at it he was 80 years old not in good shape but that soul of that man is over there protected in that sixth dimension waiting for a time to come back and pick up that body we don't believe they get a new body they get that body made new because we don't believe in and god's going to destroy the earth and then bring a whole new earth you know he's going to bring that body back out of the ground quicken it make it new and we're going to see him walk that's why we got these pictures out here our brother tatum and sister tatum at 20 years old brother and sister bush at 20 years old the ones that we've got this past on 20 years old got 15 minutes that's a 15-minute bail and uh we're going to see them in their youth because remember we planted them in corruption because their body did not come to a place of purity are perfection all right but now when they raise what are they going to raise in incorruption this soul is going to come and pick up the body bring it out of the ground we're going to stand and end corruption let's just be real honest jesus body was corruptable i said corrupt the ball it was corruptable because he was born in this satan's domain when he come out of the womb he was perfect he was not he was not born of sex he was not born in sin shaping an iniquity like you and i were but when he hit this environment of satan his body because he looked 50 and he was only 30. what did the scripture say i'm not leaving my servant soul in hell or his body see corruption that's why he had to resurrect within three days or the cells would have started popping and he would started corrupting okay so he resurrected to show us it can be done right then he walks through the wall with that body and he eats fish and honeycomb right fishing honeycomb that's what he ate and it didn't fall through the floor it went into something he had substance in other words faith is the substance of things hoped for he had a substance body that could walk through that wall yet they could touch him thomas touched him right put his hand in his side the wound was open put his hand in that side right he was he okay so that's what we're going to be when we resurrect but we've got to come to a place everybody's not going to come to that place sorry ain't going to happen it's only going to look how narrow it is up here there's only a few going to reach this headstone position where they can call the dead out of the ground it's going to be very few when brother brown said i doubt 12 in georgia i believe he meant 12 to stand at the chains not just 12 people it's going to make the rapture 12 people stand to make the change okay but we've got the first half look let's read this we've got to be so in love with him so when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit why and the only way you can do that is become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you remember i've always said god's nose are the best yeses you ever get because if he says no he knows that if he says yes this is what you'll do but if he says no you'll do this for the glory of god all right and look here having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust escaped it see who it is who see who it's too is to the church them who are in christ has been exalted above these things not he exalted himself brother brown said you can naturally have these virtues but somewhere along the way god's going to test them and if you fail what'd he say you got to go back down anybody ever remember the old game called shoots and letters that's what reminds me of the statue of a perfect man because you get i mean you had the shoots and ladders you go down and shoot or you start up that ladder and somebody knock you off or you you'd get the wrong number and you'd have to go back down well that's to me because remember jacob's ladder what jacob's ladder to me has too many jacob's ladder looks like one it looks like this it's a ladder that goes to heaven and it's got steps on it and also remember me talking about it being uh it's just dna strain what does a dna strain look like it looks like a ladder it's got steps in between it and that's what you are and that's what jacob saw he saw angels ascending and descending not descending and uh standing they were already here so they were ascending and descending all right and that ladder to me is a statue of a perfect man now jacob didn't go up that ladder but you and i can because you know what the word was there for everybody to go up that statue of a perfect man but it took a profit to put the rocks back in order rock means what revelation he had to put the revelation back in order to bring us to christ a true prophet points you straight to christ not to himself that's what he done he pointed us to christ so that we could commune with him not with novel eliezer it wasn't ellie either isaac and rebecca in the bed chamber three's the crowd but ellie easier told her so much of him so when she saw him she'd never seen him in his life in her life we've never physically seen jesus christ in our life but brother brown said he'd become so visible among us what through the message that that man preached to us he brought he didn't bring christ down we did because remember revelations 10 1 through 7 read verse 8 and 9. john is the type of you and i right all right john did not take the book from revelations 10 7 he didn't take it from that angel he took it from the mighty angels now now now elijah had to turn us to christ right but john took the book from the one that had his foot on the landing on the sea now that wasn't william brown that was christ that he preached to us so visible until we took the book from christ but if you take a book from william brown you're lost you're lost if you just take the book and say william brown was my prophet and he got it and i just got to believe what he said that's not that's not it people he pointed us straight to christ now if you go to christ you're going to turn and see the message of the hour that's right you can't help it right seed life comes through the body you can't get born out there like daddy said they're dead now my brother brown said they were lodges sorry folks they have these great big campaigns they can heal sick raise the dead but if they're still father-son holy ghost baptism and they're still doing what they're doing they're dead they're dead while they're living you can't go convert a baptist church anymore because it's a lodge brother brown called them lodges that's all they'll be bible called them dead birds right on the point of willing running uh brother brown said if you put a full stop a period you call it period here that's where you organize that's right it's a comma it's whatever the pentecostals had what william brown that's right because what's going to happen is the bible said false prophets and false christs would come now brother brown's dead he's gone his voice is over as far as his voice but the voice is in the bride but where's the false prophets gonna come from they're not gonna come from baptists because their faults already i'm sorry brother brown said it i didn't they're dead so they're right here they're dead there's no way they can come up to be bribed unless they accept the word of the hour that's what he said now the baptist had the word of the hour and when they had the word of the hour when they first started they had the word of the hour they were bribed true right luther wesley but now when they denominated like she said and put a period they died well now when they died and didn't accept no more of that and they accepted creeds and this this and that and the other they died and that when you die there's only one way to resurrect that's when we go back to what we said if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal body if it's not in there you're going to stay in the ground that's right all the way through the tribulation through the millennium white throne judgment you're going to come okay yeah so everybody will go okay with that as far as the foundation the mighty angel came down brother branham explained why he was here that's to my knowledge to bring all of it together he explained why christ was here and who he was because john the mighty angel says let's read that let's read it let's just read it that way it'll take all your uh take all your worries away right here excuse me revelation 10 7 and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery is only one mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets never look at number eight and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth he didn't take it from the seventh angel messenger's hand the seventh angel messenger is to bring the mystery of god to a completion amen right he's supposed to bring the mystery box and then we're supposed to take the open book right we're supposed to take the open book from christ if we just get a knowledge of this message or a knowledge i was telling him last night i had a knowledge at 14 years old that brother brian was a prophet and that this was right and it was sex in the garden and there's no eternal i had a knowledge of that and you know what that knowledge was right but i wasn't born again that was just my outside man agreeing like brother ryan said he said baptism he said that's just plain he said you don't need a revelation right but see the real revelation is to realize that you john have to take that book and it didn't say excuse me it did not say that john left some pages laying on the floor right because sometimes we a lot of that's just too much to eat there and that's just a little too much to eat there and i don't think i'll eat that i don't really enjoy that that's true right john took the whole book and it disappeared but it disappeared and became john come on and you never see that book again until the white throne judgment and who's there the books open again which is you and i god's not got a great big dusty book and he's going to and start flipping through the now he's going to say wesley step forward bring your people you judge these people here wesley you bring your people you judge your people pentecostal you come you judge your people what we're in the book we're in the book you don't see that book anymore sure it speaks of the book but you never see this book open until revelations 19 and 20 when we're standing at the white throne judgment and then what's open not a book you that's right you go through walmart god's gonna ladies gonna say god you never ever came by my path he'll have about three or four sisters or three or four brothers come out and they'll he'll say i sent you four witnesses i didn't see one i sent you four and you denied every one of them so as you deny them you deny me right same way with the reverse of that sister christine driving down the road she has a flat tire a guy comes by and just don't know her from nobody just shows her an act of kindness now he may be a drunk a thief a liar and he may have ten wives never darken the door of a church but when that book is open when that book's open it's going to be written in there that that man showed kindness to that system yes and jesus that man knows the environment he's standing in he knows he's gone because he doesn't have the same spirit because he's being judged but what a what a god yes yes sister thing she sold it she taught more last night i've ever heard her talk in her life but that's good that means she can but she's standing in the back and she's this little squirrely voice little girl and there's millions of people standing out there and god's getting ready to pass judgment on that man because that that man don't know who the christ is yeah and christine's going to excuse me lord yes lord lord and he'll hear her he'll say step forward she'll say lord don't you remember this man one rainy night train come on top yes and you said yes that a cup of water in my mind will never be forgotten over this side or on that side that's right what a great thing to say sir because of this sister enter into the joy of the lord so it works both ways but we are witness and that's what this is it's revelation 10 7 it's in the days of the voice it's what is what you and i are saying now now it can't be different than what the prophet said don't let's don't get wrong on that we've got to say what he said he said you say what's on tape and you say what's in these books because wrapped in faith lays in there right okay so long we say that and stay in scripture then we're fine so we're building i want us i want this to build our faith to where we can say either well i know i'm born again or i know i'm lost one of the two okay you know you lost then we can we can you know you can work your way up through here potentially right in sanctification you can get part of it because you got to have some virtue you got to have some knowledge and temperaments and patience you have parts of it all right so what i'm not hallelujah praise the lord get all them kids are screaming but remember to be considered to have the divine right here partakers of his divine nature you wasn't born with his divine nature sorry that's right you were born with the nature of your mom and daddy and the world and that was what was molded but when you become partakers of his divine nature you've escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so in other words you get a free ride to glory but god doesn't want us just to stay babies right yeah i love deanna like she is but i don't want her to stay that way i wanted to grow up i wanted to be have a full life well that's what this is you're just baby faith is just really inside of you it's like brother brown says it's like a button just a little dot that god wants to start working on he's still working on me then what's going to happen but it's not but now wait a minute i can't control my temper okay then you shut him off right there and you can't control your temper but when you just lay it in god's hand that's why that's why i say it's the birth of the word it's a god's going to show you where you where you're at well brother brown said you know where you at at any time with god why look in the mirror here's the mirror right here look in the mirror and sure we got to remember just quickly before we go we got to remember though that that if we get if we get sharp with our spouse or sharp with somebody that's not that doesn't mean you're lost that's right but what you do after that proves what where you're at because jesus got a little angry one time yes yeah okay he had a purpose behind what he was doing but remember those same people he drove out of the temple he died for him on the cross same people father forgive them they know not what they're doing so he he went to the same place for the same group of people he didn't disclude them and say none of them i drove out of the temple now i don't want no he said father forgive them all before they don't know what they're doing so we'll start with um a little more faith next week no all right no i'm going to be a brother burley's next sunday i guess he didn't call back last night but he wanted me to preach for him next sunday so we'll i guess paul will do it if he's still alive by this power hey how are you okay but you know what told me a text message but it's got half of it you know how it'll break into two and she said um i'll talk to you later just go on if you want to so i don't know what's wrong with her and i tried to call her thank you all right with that finish
