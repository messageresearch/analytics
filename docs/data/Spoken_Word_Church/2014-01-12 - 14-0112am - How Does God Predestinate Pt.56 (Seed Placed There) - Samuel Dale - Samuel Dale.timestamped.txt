[14:31] name
[14:33] amen Romans
[14:39] 8 and we know that all things work
[14:42] together for good to them that love God
[14:44] to them who are the called according to
[14:47] his
[14:48] purpose for whom he did for know he also
[14:52] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[14:54] image of his son that he might be the
[14:55] firstborn among many Brethren more over
[14:58] whom he did
[15:00] predestinate them he also called and
[15:03] whom he called them he also Justified
[15:06] and whom he justified them he also
[15:08] glorified what shall we then say to
[15:10] these
[15:11] things if God be for us who can be
[15:15] against us we don't have to worry do we
[15:18] all right Revelations
[15:20] 13 verse
[15:23] 8-10 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[15:25] shall worship Him whose names are not
[15:27] written in The Book of Life of the lamb
[15:30] slain from the foundation of the
[15:33] world if any man have an ear let him
[15:37] hear let him here because it's a truth
[15:39] we believe it but now watch this too he
[15:42] that leadth into
[15:44] captivity shall go into
[15:47] captivity he that kth with a sword must
[15:50] be killed with a sword here is the
[15:52] patience and faith of the Saints you may
[15:55] be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to
[15:58] the reading of the
[16:01] word
[16:05] now we have
[16:07] been covering and was covering this
[16:11] past uh
[16:14] Wednesday and been covering for quite a
[16:17] while that when Paul said you know there
[16:20] in in
[16:23] Romans he said Faith cometh by hearing
[16:28] and hearing by the
[16:29] word and he said how can they hear
[16:32] without a
[16:33] preacher well that puts it in a good
[16:36] category because we believe God has
[16:39] ordained a five-fold Ministry to carry
[16:41] the message on that the prophet has
[16:43] brought unto us right now but it doesn't
[16:47] stop there it says how can they preach
[16:51] unless they be
[16:53] sent now do you realize what we would be
[16:56] doing do you realize what people do that
[16:59] are
[17:02] uh not sent of God to
[17:05] preach what would they
[17:10] preach they they can't preach the truth
[17:13] if they're not sin of God all right so
[17:16] then that's why I read that scripture it
[17:18] said he that leadth into
[17:22] captivity shall go into
[17:25] captivity and if you kill with a sword
[17:28] you must be killed with a sword all
[17:31] right now if I take my own ideas and try
[17:36] to express to you my
[17:39] ideas know see then I will
[17:43] lead you into
[17:46] captivity and I'll go into captivity to
[17:48] that thought myself amen all right now
[17:53] if that's true then we can truly see
[17:56] then it that it's right that that how
[17:58] can they hear without a preacher but how
[18:01] can he preach unless he be sent all
[18:05] right because if he's not sin of God
[18:08] he'll bring his own ideas we'll read it
[18:10] in a minute where the Prophet says that
[18:12] you know talking about organization
[18:16] denominationalism see because every
[18:18] preacher that's standing in the pull pit
[18:20] today around the
[18:22] world is trying to sew a seed because
[18:27] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[18:29] all right
[18:31] but now if it's a hybrid seed which
[18:34] means anything mixed
[18:37] with is what you call a hybrid you know
[18:40] we're very familiar in our day of times
[18:42] of hybrid seeds you know and corn and
[18:45] different things cuz really you can't
[18:46] hardly get anything anymore that's
[18:48] original and even if you get the
[18:50] original that's not too original you
[18:52] know because it it's got problems and uh
[18:56] but yet
[18:58] a hybrid
[19:00] seed would produce a hybrid
[19:03] product and that's why you see then
[19:06] around the world you know all the
[19:08] different
[19:11] denominations right and then you see in
[19:14] this message how many uh swings and
[19:18] pulls and denominations there is you
[19:22] know it's man's
[19:25] ideas trying to speak about the word of
[19:29] God all right so now we ever there's
[19:34] there's not a preacher you wouldn't call
[19:35] nobody up and say you know any preacher
[19:38] anywhere uh are you going to se Bad Seed
[19:41] today oh
[19:42] no the Lord is telling me
[19:47] this
[19:50] well I didn't know the Lord was that
[19:52] vastly confused myself to where that he
[19:55] could just allow everybody to preach
[19:57] what they wanted to
[19:59] believe and that was what I was trying
[20:01] to get to point to
[20:03] you he brother around said stay with
[20:06] your pastor
[20:09] what come on as long as he stays with
[20:12] the
[20:13] word then what did he say
[20:18] do he said get away from it you know why
[20:23] because see if I lead into if if I do as
[20:27] a scripture says
[20:31] that and I try to lead into
[20:36] captivity I'll go into captivity and
[20:39] I'll lead you into
[20:41] captivity and that's where Jesus would
[20:43] say about the you know the Pharisees the
[20:45] preachers the things he said you know
[20:48] they stand in the door and said they
[20:51] won't go in and said they won't let the
[20:54] others go in that's right so then you're
[20:56] going to have to make a choice we need
[20:58] to make a get a clear decision in our
[21:02] mind you know and and get it settled to
[21:06] whether or not we
[21:08] believe see the truth if not then we
[21:11] need to move on that's I've never been
[21:14] nothing to try to get you to come to me
[21:18] I've always tried my best to preach the
[21:19] word and as I said a moment ago I've
[21:22] never heard a preacher yet say that he
[21:24] was going to get up and preach a lie
[21:26] have you I mean everybody's LED of the
[21:30] lord well that's sounds like Mass
[21:35] confusion but just
[21:39] remember what we were covering Wednesday
[21:41] night what the prophet said spoken words
[21:43] of regional
[21:44] seed he said the seed comes to the
[21:47] body The Germ he said comes to the body
[21:51] that's right all and he said you know
[21:54] talking
[21:55] about the angels and how they they would
[21:58] be you know come and tell Peter and them
[22:02] but it was Peter that carried the
[22:04] word the angel can't car the word now
[22:06] you're talking about there Heavenly form
[22:08] Angels not the word Angel using in the
[22:11] form of messenger
[22:14] Etc all right and in doing that
[22:21] then if the seed would to come through
[22:23] the body
[22:25] then I have a word to bring
[22:29] and I'm trying to preach to you the best
[22:31] that I
[22:33] can what I believe the word
[22:36] says and that's sewing a
[22:39] seed all right now it will only
[22:44] reproduce whatever the kind of seed
[22:48] that's planted
[22:49] right see that's why we all have to make
[22:52] our calling and election
[22:55] sure can you say well brother D I just
[22:57] can't find nobody I can agree
[22:59] with
[23:04] well that makes you a one person
[23:08] denomination right and now wait just a
[23:11] minute now how would you saying that
[23:15] well if I'm the only person that's got
[23:18] the
[23:19] truth that might be all right but I
[23:23] don't believe that I'm the only person
[23:26] that's got the truth I don't believe
[23:28] you're the only person that's got the
[23:30] truth so I we just become a denomination
[23:33] if we believe we have the truth and
[23:35] nobody else don't have
[23:36] it well people just don't understand me
[23:39] in my ways well tell me what you're
[23:41] saying in the Bible right amen and let's
[23:44] see whether it's in the word or not all
[23:46] right but you see then we know for
[23:49] assurity that Faith cometh by
[23:56] hearing hearing by the
[24:00] word and how can we hear without a
[24:03] preacher right and how can he preach
[24:06] unless he be
[24:07] sent all right
[24:10] now in doing that
[24:13] then we believe we need Faith
[24:17] right
[24:19] true we believe we need
[24:21] Faith
[24:23] Revelation all right so then Revelation
[24:26] comes by hearing
[24:28] well no I didn't hear nobody I got this
[24:31] all by
[24:33] myself that's a one person denomination
[24:36] okay go
[24:38] ahead see because as I keep saying it to
[24:41] make sure you don't misunderstand me if
[24:44] you read the Bible that's what somebody
[24:46] said if you listen to The Prophet's
[24:49] message that's what somebody said all
[24:52] right so you're not getting it the Bible
[24:54] says everything we have we what we
[25:00] received all right so then it's totally
[25:03] dependent
[25:05] upon whether or not we can believe the
[25:07] seed of God has been sown we say we
[25:10] believe the prophet brought the message
[25:12] perfect and pure and unadulterated I
[25:14] agree I say that over and
[25:17] over but then he said the five-fold
[25:19] ministry was to take it and break it
[25:21] down to the
[25:23] people you know what gets
[25:26] me I'm just honest I'm plain and blunt
[25:29] all you know what gets
[25:31] me is when you say things like that
[25:34] talking about a five- full ministry you
[25:36] know the pro you know the ones that you
[25:38] have problems with
[25:41] preachers the ones that order to jump up
[25:43] and scream and say
[25:45] Amen you right cuz you're talking about
[25:49] them as preachers but instead of that
[25:52] it's you know down
[25:56] why cuz they don't believe believe
[25:57] you're called right they believe they're
[26:02] called that's all
[26:05] right I just say that I'm not trying to
[26:08] build a church I'm trying to my best to
[26:10] preach the
[26:12] gospel and doing that that I realized
[26:14] that I'm planting a
[26:17] seed and I must be very careful what I
[26:20] plant because if I plant my own
[26:25] ideas I will produce a hybrid church
[26:29] right right and I will become hybrid
[26:33] myself and that's no no problems with
[26:36] that all right I just try to be honest
[26:38] and
[26:39] sensible and try to get to you what I'm
[26:42] talking
[26:45] about see we know that the seed of God
[26:48] is the word of God
[26:51] right all right but we also know that if
[26:54] that word does not have the German of
[27:00] life it will not
[27:02] produce all right now as making a
[27:08] point uh we talk about hybrids won't
[27:11] reproduce now we know what we're talking
[27:13] about we know what the prophet is
[27:14] talking
[27:15] about but you can plant corn as
[27:19] hybrid and next year you can plant that
[27:23] corn that you raised off of that it
[27:26] won't bring up beans
[27:29] it'll bring up corn right but it'll be
[27:33] deformed or you know perverted or
[27:35] whatever you want to call
[27:38] it well then can't we see
[27:43] that then if the preacher brings the
[27:49] word all
[27:51] right and that leans it to an
[27:56] organization or how
[27:58] hbd it'll bring forth a
[28:03] life or do you think all these
[28:05] organizations come from or you think all
[28:07] the denominations come
[28:09] from you know that every one of them
[28:11] claims to be based upon the
[28:14] word
[28:17] right well did the word produce
[28:21] that or was it some hybrid preacher
[28:24] preaching it that's right
[28:29] okay see you better
[28:31] know and we all talk about it being the
[28:35] end you better know what you're
[28:38] believing what you're listening to
[28:43] because the crop's going to be
[28:45] produced all right but now then we
[28:48] believe that Faith cometh by
[28:51] hearing and hearing comes by somebody
[28:55] preaching it to us we said well brother
[28:58] random brought it I'm just staying with
[29:00] that well goodbye go home stay
[29:03] there I'm not going to fuss with you
[29:06] about
[29:08] it but
[29:10] see my dependency is
[29:13] upon the word of God that has been made
[29:16] known to us by way of the Prophet right
[29:21] and then in that my dependence is upon
[29:25] the five-fold ministry to break break
[29:27] that down as he said to where that I can
[29:32] understand
[29:32] it all right so I I believe that I'm in
[29:35] the right channel you
[29:37] know and
[29:40] uh but just think about
[29:43] it but do we really
[29:49] believe do we really
[29:52] believe that the preacher is to bring
[29:55] the word to us that's right amen you
[29:57] know do I mean do we really believe
[30:03] that and then do we put our whole
[30:06] confidence in
[30:09] that
[30:11] amen you
[30:13] know and we put our life upon it cuz you
[30:16] don't you know you
[30:19] realize whether you want to believe it
[30:21] or not your life is on the
[30:26] line being in the wrong ranks the
[30:28] prophet said at the Rapture or something
[30:30] paraphrasing it would be no
[30:33] excuse all
[30:35] right but see we've got to find the word
[30:38] and rally around the word amen amen all
[30:42] right now in doing that then we're in
[30:46] the same shape as we'll read in a minute
[30:49] that down Through the
[30:53] Ages down Through the Ages the prophet
[30:56] said the word was sown in each
[30:59] age right right but see when Martin
[31:03] Luther came along with the message of
[31:05] the just shall live by
[31:07] faith did the religious World believe
[31:11] him
[31:15] no but you know what don't make no
[31:19] difference he was right and they was
[31:22] wrong
[31:24] right when this Prophet com and brought
[31:26] us a message did the religious World
[31:29] accept it
[31:31] no but you know what he was right they
[31:35] was
[31:38] wrong he says you can't denominate this
[31:41] message why cuz you're not going to see
[31:43] a sign over the church it says we are
[31:46] the brandom
[31:48] Tabernacle uh
[31:51] denomination but he said you can
[31:53] organize it in the lady of sea all right
[31:57] when when you organize what happens you
[31:58] immediately die because organization is
[32:02] hybrid
[32:04] religion watch that now as we go
[32:08] along Faith then must come by
[32:11] hearing and hearing must come by
[32:13] somebody preaching it to us and that's
[32:16] word it I don't I don't have any
[32:19] problems I try to tell the
[32:21] truth that way you sisters has got
[32:24] something to do with it too you know
[32:26] right
[32:29] right well you got your own family your
[32:32] own pull pits your own
[32:35] kids all
[32:37] right and see then we can sit down and
[32:41] talk with one
[32:42] another you
[32:44] know we don't make the women like back
[32:47] in the early days that we were coming
[32:48] along you'd have meeting type of things
[32:51] and before the meeting got together you
[32:53] may go to a home or whatever but when
[32:55] they did the men went into one room the
[32:59] women had to go in the other
[33:02] room they were not allowed to mingle
[33:07] together
[33:10] well I've got a problem with that
[33:13] because I knew a lot of sisters there
[33:15] that could help those preachers if
[33:17] they'd listen to
[33:18] them you I'm
[33:21] honest but do you think they's going to
[33:24] listen
[33:25] no ain't no woman going to tell
[33:29] me well there was a few in the Bible
[33:32] that CED the gospel you
[33:38] know and see why would we worry about
[33:42] it so then Faith cometh by
[33:45] hearing you women Teach Your
[33:48] Kids Teach Your Kids The Gospel the
[33:53] truth all right then you won't have to
[33:54] worry about it why because what's your
[33:57] you're doing sisters is you're doing
[33:58] this like any preacher you're sewing a
[34:00] seed all right brothers that are not
[34:03] ministers you have a right to go out and
[34:05] talk to people about the gospel and try
[34:08] to help them
[34:10] right why because it's a part of
[34:14] you okay and why don't why don't we
[34:17] accept it that way and say thank you
[34:20] Lord now you just help me to make
[34:25] sure that I find find the
[34:28] word and rally around
[34:32] it see then that way we don't have to
[34:34] worry about it because you know it is
[34:37] the preaching of the
[34:40] Gospel we know that Jesus Christ the son
[34:43] of man was the only s of the
[34:49] seed see didn't brother randam wasn't
[34:51] the son of man he was a son of man that
[34:53] the son of man used to swow the seed in
[34:56] the end of the entire Bible so we
[34:59] believe
[35:00] it but yet what are we doing here
[35:03] today if it's not for trying
[35:07] to find a
[35:12] revelation right what's our purpose of
[35:15] gathering in a church or whatever is to
[35:19] hear right all
[35:22] right see then and realize then that the
[35:25] prophet said
[35:29] The Germ the seed comes through the
[35:32] body I wasn't the one that wrote the
[35:35] book I wasn't the one that preached the
[35:38] message he said the 5old Ministries for
[35:41] the perfecting of the Saints that's what
[35:42] the Bible
[35:44] says but how can they preach unless they
[35:48] be
[35:49] sent all right so then make sure what
[35:53] you're listening to
[35:55] right
[35:58] well that that that brother he's doing
[36:00] good but he's a little off
[36:04] well what in the world would you want to
[36:06] listen to that far
[36:07] then if you know he's a little
[36:10] off you that's
[36:14] right well brother D I believe you're a
[36:16] little off back the room is back
[36:19] there after the
[36:22] service we'll take all the time we can
[36:25] to sit down and talk to you about it you
[36:29] know but see I believe then that the
[36:35] gospel must be preached
[36:39] right but part
[36:42] gospel you can't get a birth of the
[36:46] word why is it that now come on are you
[36:50] with me all these churches around the
[36:53] world whatever they are
[36:55] Brites lul I who right or denominations
[37:00] or
[37:03] whatever there's a lot of churches today
[37:06] that will have multitudes of conversions
[37:12] right
[37:14] now do you believe they're getting the
[37:16] new
[37:19] birth I believe it's possible for them
[37:21] to I go that
[37:24] way but I believe it's very rare don't
[37:26] you
[37:27] right well now you can't preach a
[37:30] trinity and get a new
[37:34] birth you would birth a
[37:37] trinity that's not the
[37:40] gospel you see why it's so important to
[37:42] preach the truth
[37:45] amen all
[37:47] right and see Let It Be then the the
[37:50] seed that you're
[37:52] sewing cuz I tried to make it plain when
[37:55] I was saved
[37:58] a seed without a germ of life in it is
[38:01] no
[38:04] good all right then there can't be a
[38:06] germ of life in a denominational Creed
[38:12] right come
[38:15] on well if it's part truth what are you
[38:17] going to
[38:19] get you're going to get a
[38:23] hybrid cuz it's not the truth right
[38:28] amen well you think you're the only one
[38:31] I didn't say that I've always taught you
[38:34] that I believe the word is being taught
[38:36] around the
[38:38] world that's right I believe that the
[38:43] truth I never have believed everybody's
[38:46] going to say cat and the guy over in
[38:48] Africa says cat and one in India says
[38:50] cat I never believed like
[38:53] that but I believe the god that can
[38:56] reveal reveal the word to me and you can
[38:57] reveal it to anyone else that'll make
[38:59] theirself
[39:03] available all right see because it's the
[39:08] gospel the Bible says the gospel is
[39:12] what the power of God under salvation
[39:16] what now paraphrasing scriptures but
[39:20] close to them that
[39:25] believe
[39:27] let it believe the truth you remember
[39:29] how I tried to preach on that back under
[39:31] in the series one time about that Jesus
[39:33] said You shall know the truth and the
[39:35] truth shall set you free he didn't say
[39:37] you had to know about the
[39:40] truth the truth is the only thing that
[39:42] can give a new birth that's right part
[39:44] truth can't bring a new
[39:47] birth all right so you see where we're
[39:49] at in what we're
[39:51] thinking the gospel must be
[39:55] preached
[39:57] all right and see then it once it's
[40:00] preached we were listening to the tape
[40:02] last night and brother around said when
[40:04] that life member comes in he said then
[40:07] the lamb can leave The Mercy
[40:09] Seat of
[40:11] course everybody believed that was 63
[40:14] didn't
[40:16] it or 77 or
[40:19] whatever but we're still
[40:23] here all right so there must have been
[40:26] something wrong WR
[40:27] there okay but think about it now if
[40:32] it's a gerti
[40:33] seed it will produce so you take a grain
[40:37] of corn if it's gerti put it in the
[40:39] ground do correctly water with it what
[40:42] moisture and it it'll
[40:45] produce right but if it's not gerti
[40:48] what's
[40:50] wrong it won't come up right so in the
[40:55] gospel
[40:57] if we are preaching the truth the truth
[41:00] will
[41:05] produce and see when it
[41:08] produces it will prove that it's
[41:12] gerti all
[41:14] right you see why I spent so much time
[41:16] with Jesus said my words are Spirit in
[41:19] their life he said other words you said
[41:20] my words are
[41:24] gerti now any true min
[41:27] any girl woman man woman whatever if
[41:30] you're taking the truth to
[41:34] somebody you can only take what's been
[41:36] revealed to
[41:40] you all right but yet you can take
[41:44] that and speak to others about it
[41:48] right and they have the ability to
[41:52] receive why because it's a gerti seed
[41:57] see Luther could preach to the people
[41:58] about justification why because he'd
[42:02] experienced it Wesley could preach of
[42:05] sanctification he experienced it
[42:10] right Pentecostal Zeus Street could
[42:13] preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:14] because they had experienced
[42:18] it but according to the scripture if
[42:20] it's
[42:22] not God revealing it then it's not no
[42:25] good no matter how much we know about it
[42:28] what's that in a minute when we
[42:31] read but you see I'm trying my best to
[42:33] get us to
[42:35] see what
[42:39] happened and how that the prophet would
[42:43] say that we come here with a seed in
[42:47] us well I'll be glad when you get around
[42:49] to preach on
[42:52] that if I was you I wouldn't
[42:55] sleep
[42:58] you might find out one of these days I
[42:59] walk out here and say I'm through with
[43:01] that series I'm not going to preach
[43:03] anymore on
[43:05] predestination but I thought she was
[43:06] going to explain it to
[43:09] us 56
[43:12] sermons explaining
[43:15] it
[43:18] right I wouldn't wait around you know if
[43:22] I was
[43:23] you I would listen and ask God to speak
[43:27] and see if it's the truth or not and if
[43:30] I don't tell you what the prophet says
[43:32] come tell
[43:34] me but don't come to me now see that's
[43:36] where people don't like it that's why
[43:38] they don't come in the office see if I
[43:40] leave it like that people I'm coming but
[43:43] then I say don't come with a little
[43:45] silly sugar tit
[43:48] ideas I believe it's like this brother
[43:50] Dale I don't give a hoot what you
[43:53] believe I hope you don't give a hoot
[43:55] what I
[43:57] believe I
[43:59] hope that what I'm basing is on the word
[44:03] and you can believe what the word
[44:05] says now that's what I'm wanting
[44:08] sir well you don't think we got a right
[44:11] no no we don't we're not we don't have a
[44:13] right to believe anything we want to
[44:15] that's
[44:17] right cuz we're
[44:20] sheep we buar
[44:22] wool you want to manufacture It Go
[44:24] believe what you want to
[44:27] all
[44:28] right well let's listen to the prophet
[44:31] talking a little
[44:33] bit and just
[44:37] remember I wouldn't wait around on a
[44:40] message to explain
[44:45] predestination I would try to comprehend
[44:48] what's being
[44:51] said let's start out on something the
[44:54] prophet said about these things cuz we
[44:58] get to it today what I want to do
[45:00] is ask you some
[45:04] questions all
[45:10] right and when to ask you what kind
[45:15] of if you say I believe I come here with
[45:17] a seed in
[45:19] me then when was it put
[45:24] there and what is the seed that was put
[45:29] there and where was it
[45:32] placed I think I have a right to ask
[45:35] that yeah but I you you just make it too
[45:41] complicated brother random said it and
[45:44] I'll read it in a little bit he said I'm
[45:45] not doing this to try
[45:48] to start a doctor and he said I'm doing
[45:51] this to straighten it
[45:54] out going ahead and pull up number one
[45:57] brother and let's start this is on the
[45:59] mark of the beast
[46:00] 1956 7:15 paragraph or
[46:04] e48 and look what he
[46:10] says your heart is a
[46:15] womb and the womb holds the
[46:20] seed
[46:22] okay typing natural showing spiritual
[46:25] right
[46:26] and the seed is the
[46:29] gospel now the seed alone in its
[46:33] heart no matter how many gas you set
[46:37] under are you reading no matter how many
[46:41] great how no matter how great your
[46:44] pastor
[46:45] is and how much you've read the
[46:48] Bible it'll never take life until the
[46:51] germ of life has come to
[46:54] it okay
[46:57] higher
[46:59] higher wake them
[47:02] up maybe I need to do yeah okay I I'm
[47:05] running back
[47:09] here sister Gil said I need to do that
[47:11] at once in a
[47:13] while but look what he says he said it
[47:16] don't matter you know what what gamea
[47:18] what he was the greatest teacher of all
[47:21] right no matter if you set under him
[47:24] other words if you set under the
[47:25] prophet's
[47:27] message
[47:29] right no matter how much your pastor is
[47:33] how much you read the Bible it'll never
[47:35] take life until the germ of life has
[47:37] come to
[47:38] it
[47:40] right a woman seed is a wonderful
[47:44] thing it's the building of a body you
[47:47] know the egg builds the body right that
[47:50] don't give it life come on go the m has
[47:53] to do says but it has no
[47:56] life it can't it's impossible it has no
[48:00] life to begin with so no matter no
[48:02] matter how much you know the
[48:03] Bible how well it is in your
[48:08] heart you're still a
[48:12] sinner okay now what
[48:17] happens okay the heart is a
[48:20] womb and Faith cometh by an open ear
[48:25] that's not not been sealed by
[48:29] theology okay you see why a lot of
[48:30] people don't get the new
[48:32] birth Faith cometh by hearing to hear
[48:36] the word comes into the
[48:38] mind you make up your mind about
[48:42] it is this
[48:44] right could it be right that's up here
[48:47] in this plane we call a head right brain
[48:50] thinking it
[48:51] over you make up your mind about it is
[48:54] that right could that be right well the
[48:57] Bible said so I believe it now what we
[49:01] down into the heart it
[49:05] goes
[49:08] now then it's a
[49:14] womb
[49:15] so at least we could do like the
[49:20] disciples the disciples finally come to
[49:22] a place in their mind right
[49:26] that they
[49:27] said you have the words of eternal life
[49:30] where can we go that's
[49:33] right and
[49:35] watch you say I believe
[49:40] it he says we you know down into the
[49:44] heart it goes then it's a
[49:47] womb then the male sex we are the bride
[49:50] the woman the seed goes into the church
[49:53] then the male sex which is the blood
[49:54] sail the blood of Christ is applied and
[49:58] in the blood comes a germ of life that
[50:00] goes into the seed and it brings forth a
[50:03] newborn baby crying out by father now
[50:07] he's not talking about a natural seed
[50:09] because when you take a natural seed
[50:11] it's already got to have the germ in it
[50:13] right right he's talking about the
[50:15] preaching of the Gospel the truth right
[50:18] it comes in a germ that goes into the
[50:20] seed and brings forth a newborn baby
[50:23] crying ABA father ABA father my God my
[50:27] God why did I ever do those things my
[50:30] God my God there you
[50:33] are see the seed then has to be
[50:40] planted and that's what I'm trying to do
[50:42] see you've read the word
[50:45] right but see I'm trying to stir that up
[50:49] to get you to see there's a
[50:51] life that goes for
[50:54] that all right right see then you say I
[50:57] believe
[51:01] it
[51:03] right it can go down into your heart
[51:05] once you say with your mind your brain
[51:08] that I believe it but where's our
[51:11] trouble
[51:12] act in the
[51:14] brain where that he
[51:18] said and by faith cometh by an open ear
[51:23] that's not been sealed by theology
[51:28] now come
[51:28] on like brother Tom one time he took
[51:33] back to the Methodist Church he was in
[51:35] and he tried to present water baptism to
[51:39] the
[51:40] pastor you know that had taught him
[51:45] and when the pastor finished he said
[51:48] brother Tom said well now what you going
[51:50] to do about
[51:51] it he said I have to stay with with the
[51:56] church
[51:59] doctrine right right see even in his
[52:03] human
[52:05] brain that he couldn't argue about the
[52:07] water
[52:09] baptism but in his human
[52:12] mind something had done been sealed
[52:16] out you see that's why I believe in
[52:18] speaking to Soul I don't believe in
[52:20] speaking to brains and
[52:22] bodies brains and bodies don't work too
[52:25] good
[52:27] that's why I spend all the time talking
[52:29] about the soul and what it
[52:31] is brains and bodies will argue with you
[52:34] all the time yeah but I believe it's it
[52:36] I believe it's that I believe it's
[52:39] it but if you can get down into the
[52:41] inside the prophet said souls in
[52:44] prison he said if you get down into that
[52:47] inside and get that soul to agree with
[52:50] it he said that soul to
[52:52] die why cuz is going to be
[52:56] reborn all right and see that's all I'm
[52:59] trying to do is to ignite whatever you
[53:03] want to call it
[53:08] spark within
[53:11] us the word that we've
[53:15] heard that's all I'm trying to
[53:20] do
[53:22] now look what he says in the next
[53:24] message Young unchangeable
[53:27] God 1960 328 or
[53:32] 3:26 E7 and Jesus said the word is a
[53:35] seed that a sore
[53:38] sold and a seed if it's gerti and it
[53:41] goes into the ground then that seed
[53:45] under the right conditions of the Sun
[53:48] and moisture will bring forth the life
[53:50] that's in the
[53:51] seed and so is the word of God if a
[53:55] person can take that word and place it
[53:58] in their heart and give it to right
[54:01] sunshine not in your head
[54:07] right the right temperature not Su n but
[54:10] s o n and right temperature of faith in
[54:15] there that seed and promise will
[54:18] live to you just like it did at the
[54:21] beginning to the one it was given to
[54:24] because it's God's word and he is the
[54:26] same yesterday today and forever he
[54:27] cannot
[54:28] fail
[54:30] now why then was they even Jesus seen a
[54:35] 500 Brethren after his
[54:37] resurrection but only 120 made the upper
[54:43] room at least 380 people saw him after
[54:46] he raised nail prints in his
[54:49] hands side everything
[54:53] right where where were they
[54:57] at something in their mind kept them
[55:01] from going with the rest of
[55:05] them and even we know the story of the
[55:08] 120 in the upper room that they were
[55:11] having
[55:13] problems about remaining there right
[55:17] that's right is that the way your
[55:18] Prophet said
[55:19] it and one of them said let's go I think
[55:21] we got it we just take it by
[55:24] faith amen so they wasn't sitting up
[55:26] there everybody as we read it in one
[55:29] mind and one
[55:33] Accord then they come along make jokes
[55:36] out of
[55:37] it and say they cross the desert in a
[55:40] Honda because it was all in one
[55:44] Accord people are going to find out
[55:46] that's blaspheming one of these
[55:49] days but you see church maybe we might
[55:51] find out we're
[55:53] blaspheming right God what are we doing
[55:55] with the
[55:58] word take that
[56:01] word let it go down
[56:04] in and then let the spirit Quicken it
[56:07] that's
[56:08] right I can't Quicken
[56:11] it I can only sow seed right the gospel
[56:17] if it's a gerti seed now look what he
[56:19] says can happen though when a germatize
[56:21] seed as I go ahead to the next as I said
[56:24] a moment AG
[56:29] go the
[56:31] absolute 63 127 as I said a while ago
[56:36] you take a hybrid corn you plant it it
[56:39] comes up it's pretty good I love it it's
[56:42] good food
[56:43] right love take that old car
[56:48] you CU it's
[56:51] good well you know if you take it in one
[56:54] respect
[56:55] you you're making it
[56:57] wrong brother asked me something this
[56:59] morning he's that his so I said well you
[57:02] got part of it
[57:03] right that's what I said cuz he didn't
[57:06] have it right all right now when brother
[57:09] Brown says a hybrid seed can't
[57:12] reproduce you better keep
[57:15] listening he tells you it will only
[57:17] produce a warped up
[57:19] fruit right right he's not telling you
[57:22] you can't plant that hybrid seed and it
[57:24] produ that well it'll come up but it'll
[57:27] look like popcorn or
[57:32] something well think about
[57:36] it what are we doing with the
[57:39] word now which what he
[57:42] says you want to see something but now
[57:45] how can God ever watch over his word to
[57:48] vindicate and the person disbelieve in
[57:51] that word and won't receive it in their
[57:53] heart how can you do it
[57:56] how can the sun shine upon a seed and
[57:58] bring it to life when it hasn't got any
[58:00] life in
[58:01] it it's got to be a germatize seed so a
[58:05] Creed is gerti to make more members
[58:13] right now are we
[58:17] right you thought a grain of corn what
[58:19] are you trying to do no I'm trying my
[58:21] best to explain what he's talking about
[58:23] right
[58:26] you plant that hybrid corn it will
[58:31] reproduce but what will it
[58:34] reproduce a hybrid
[58:37] condition right look what he
[58:40] says how how can you do for it's got
[58:43] it's got to be a gerti seat so a Creed
[58:45] is gerti to make more members look but
[58:48] the word of God is gerti to make more
[58:50] Saints make Believers right not make
[58:54] believers make us Believers
[58:57] right that's
[59:00] right and God works to perform his word
[59:03] he watches over it to vindicate it yes
[59:06] sir so
[59:08] then is it possible for you and I
[59:11] to
[59:15] take a
[59:19] seed and believe it's
[59:23] beautiful
[59:25] and then when it
[59:30] reproduce What happens when you hybrid
[59:32] something
[59:34] right you hybd it you you take many and
[59:36] you put it together right to keep coming
[59:38] down okay I don't know the formula I'm
[59:41] just saying they may have took big old
[59:43] corn old corn we used to eat you
[59:47] know and they mated it together with
[59:51] popcorn maybe and they come out with
[59:53] some beautiful corn and
[59:55] no but you take that and plan it it's
[59:58] going to try to go
[1:00:00] back to where it started from right but
[1:00:04] it can't go back it doesn't have the
[1:00:07] ability to to do it you keep planing it
[1:00:10] it'll just die why because it doesn't
[1:00:12] have the ability to go back where it
[1:00:13] come
[1:00:14] from all right so you take my ideas and
[1:00:18] your ideas upon the word of God and we
[1:00:21] pervert the word of God and it cannot
[1:00:23] produce the or
[1:00:28] seat you said well brother Dale why
[1:00:30] don't you just tell us what you're
[1:00:31] talking about okay I
[1:00:35] will you say I believe I come here with
[1:00:37] a seed in
[1:00:43] me where was it at when was it put
[1:00:51] there you know that's all the questions
[1:00:53] I'm asking
[1:00:55] well question gender
[1:00:57] Strife yeah and they generally make a
[1:00:59] nut look like one
[1:01:04] too
[1:01:07] right but
[1:01:11] listen think about
[1:01:13] it go ahead number four there's a man
[1:01:16] here that can turn on the light 63 1229
[1:01:19] the morning
[1:01:20] service plant the wheat out there and
[1:01:23] it'll put it in the basement cover it
[1:01:25] over and it'll never bring forth
[1:01:28] anything because it can't there's no
[1:01:31] light there but as soon as the light
[1:01:34] strikes it then it it'll bring forth if
[1:01:39] it's a gerti
[1:01:42] seed that's the same thing it is in the
[1:01:45] word see the word is God and when the LI
[1:01:49] strikes it it brings it life strikes it
[1:01:51] it brings the word to life again every
[1:01:54] age has always been that oh how we
[1:01:57] appreciate these great things and how
[1:01:59] that the word being Vindicated is the
[1:02:01] light of the spoken word every
[1:02:05] age I said about Luther when he preached
[1:02:07] the he was probably preach sermons on
[1:02:10] the J you live by faith it didn't
[1:02:13] Quicken a lot of other people were
[1:02:15] talking about it
[1:02:16] too you know we want to just put it on
[1:02:18] one person whatever there was a lot of
[1:02:21] go back and study your history part of
[1:02:23] it there was a a lot of people protest
[1:02:25] in the Catholic Church before Luther
[1:02:27] ever come along right right that's right
[1:02:30] see we don't just make it one thing was
[1:02:32] no there was a lot of it why because
[1:02:34] there was things trying to spring up but
[1:02:36] they couldn't do any good why because
[1:02:38] they still had their own ideas when
[1:02:41] Luther caught that to just you live by
[1:02:43] faith that was the seat of that
[1:02:46] age it was not hybrid you said but he
[1:02:48] was a trinitarian part of baptism was
[1:02:51] wrong sure it
[1:02:53] was
[1:02:55] but that don't mean anything about the
[1:02:56] seed that he
[1:03:00] planted he planted that
[1:03:02] justification for that day pure and
[1:03:06] unadulterated
[1:03:08] amen because it was the seed of God so
[1:03:11] is every
[1:03:14] age if it's a gerti
[1:03:18] seed but now suppose at the same time
[1:03:21] Luther was preaching that just shall
[1:03:22] live by faith uh brother Donnie was
[1:03:25] talking to us yesterday said there's a
[1:03:28] big preacher on the radio and said he
[1:03:32] said the reason my church is growing I
[1:03:35] Don't Preach against
[1:03:41] sin you know what I think
[1:03:46] of I I shouldn't say what I think a lot
[1:03:48] of times but you know what I think of I
[1:03:52] think of the day brother R said
[1:03:54] prostitution went up last year he said
[1:03:57] it is is it of God that's his word you
[1:04:01] think your Prophet don't talk right but
[1:04:04] that was his
[1:04:05] words but you see
[1:04:07] church we look at that and we say that's
[1:04:12] wrong but we then defend people who are
[1:04:16] just a little bit
[1:04:18] off well that's their way of seeing
[1:04:21] it what's the difference in a little bit
[1:04:24] a whole
[1:04:28] lot most of the time the whole Lots can
[1:04:30] be helped the ones with a little bit
[1:04:32] can't because they won't admit it all
[1:04:37] right but think about
[1:04:41] it we think well we we was born with
[1:04:44] this seed in
[1:04:46] us well why was it it made
[1:04:50] alive and now they're saying that the
[1:04:52] new birth is all it is is just a a
[1:04:54] knowledge comes to
[1:04:56] you you know you you just get a
[1:04:59] knowledge that you're born again well
[1:05:02] the disciples was with Jesus three and a
[1:05:04] half years they had a pretty good
[1:05:06] knowledge of what he's talking
[1:05:09] about
[1:05:11] right but did that Quicken the word look
[1:05:13] at the next one spoken words Original
[1:05:16] Seed 62 318 paragraph 254 really 255 or
[1:05:21] 265 excuse
[1:05:23] me when it fell on those seeds Jesus
[1:05:26] said he chose them when before the
[1:05:28] foundation of the world then there were
[1:05:30] a predestinated seed now he's talking
[1:05:32] about the upper room experience right is
[1:05:35] that right congregation said amen then
[1:05:37] had here they haul themselves up into
[1:05:40] the upper room these seeds the word and
[1:05:44] the Word was laying on there without
[1:05:47] life in
[1:05:53] it
[1:05:55] go what you want to all of a sudden
[1:05:58] there came a sound from Heaven as the
[1:06:00] waters began to rush down and it
[1:06:02] actually filled all the house where and
[1:06:03] they were sitting and the seeds begin to
[1:06:06] grow it began to manifest itself the
[1:06:09] word of God being
[1:06:11] manifested right but yet he said it was
[1:06:15] laying there without
[1:06:17] life and I'll go ahead and say it this
[1:06:19] way cuz I know that the way most people
[1:06:21] preach it about the seed laying there
[1:06:23] they say the seeds laying in you dormant
[1:06:26] now I want a quote for that there's like
[1:06:29] 20 times maybe a little more of the
[1:06:32] times brother brandham uses the word
[1:06:34] dormant but you won't find him saying
[1:06:37] the seed was laying in you
[1:06:41] dormant I want to
[1:06:47] quote
[1:06:50] because people say the brother around
[1:06:52] said this
[1:06:57] I've heard it over and over brother R
[1:06:59] said you always was eternal I want a
[1:07:01] quote where it says you always was
[1:07:04] eternal I'm putting it out to you put it
[1:07:07] out on the internet put it out
[1:07:10] anywhere but yet we sympathize well well
[1:07:13] brother you just don't
[1:07:16] understand I know it I know I don't
[1:07:19] understand I'm a
[1:07:21] dummy but I'm trying to tell the truth
[1:07:24] amen if nothing else let me be the dumb
[1:07:25] donkey he told the prophet the truth did
[1:07:28] he that's right saved the prophet's
[1:07:31] life all right but think about
[1:07:39] it we'll just put it right here here's a
[1:07:43] favorite quote go ahead with number 5 a
[1:07:45] I added this in
[1:07:47] after when you hear me 4 a 5 a that
[1:07:50] means I put it in her later you
[1:07:52] know but I thought you know a lot of
[1:07:54] people say I come into this world with a
[1:07:56] seed in
[1:07:58] me and they'll say I I don't need
[1:08:02] nothing because always was
[1:08:09] eternal but just look at what the
[1:08:13] prophet is
[1:08:15] saying that's right see we're so
[1:08:18] revelated until we just put in anything
[1:08:21] we want to as I told you they used to
[1:08:23] say the soul is just the nature of the
[1:08:25] spirit there is no quote for
[1:08:27] that the quote is soul is the nature of
[1:08:30] the spirit when you say just the nature
[1:08:32] of the spirit you're just making it like
[1:08:34] a bird dog a cat or any kind of a
[1:08:36] something it's not there but yet
[1:08:40] preachers say that and it's captivated
[1:08:43] the minds of the people and they took a
[1:08:45] denominational hybrid
[1:08:52] seed
[1:08:54] that's why I warn
[1:08:55] you be careful what you listen
[1:08:59] to Just remember
[1:09:02] now if you're listening to
[1:09:06] something and that goes in that mind and
[1:09:10] drops down in it'll become part of
[1:09:15] you and you're going to have to kill
[1:09:19] it or it'll
[1:09:21] produce another two Souls
[1:09:24] doctor or
[1:09:27] whatever
[1:09:29] right yeah like one man I heard him say
[1:09:32] what you call it two Souls y to this
[1:09:34] what I believe well then he turned
[1:09:36] around and said exactly what the two
[1:09:37] Soul Doctrine was
[1:09:41] well but you see we're making it so what
[1:09:44] so let's read this of what the prophet
[1:09:46] says you always was
[1:09:49] saved I don't mind taking what the
[1:09:52] things he said CU I believe them
[1:09:56] right and and there was a day I wouldn't
[1:09:58] have D read that to you and tell you I
[1:10:01] understand cuz I
[1:10:05] didn't and there's no need of lying
[1:10:07] about it but what did he say this is
[1:10:10] taken to the Future home 64802 paragraph
[1:10:14] 232 there is your holy
[1:10:17] convocation not have anything to do with
[1:10:19] the literal things it's beyond that it's
[1:10:21] into the kingdom of God with ET etal
[1:10:24] life with the predestinated that never
[1:10:27] did
[1:10:29] start I agree with that 100%
[1:10:32] predestinated never
[1:10:41] started it never started on any
[1:10:46] day you wasn't saved on any
[1:10:52] day
[1:10:54] you was always
[1:10:56] saved right well let's go
[1:11:02] home
[1:11:06] right if that's what you believe you
[1:11:08] might as well go home and forget it cuz
[1:11:10] you're wasting time money coming do
[1:11:16] it and you know that's what's preached
[1:11:19] by the biggest portion of the message
[1:11:22] now
[1:11:24] you don't believe it click on the
[1:11:28] internet you was always
[1:11:32] saved now then you don't need
[1:11:35] Jesus you don't need
[1:11:39] salvation and as I said if the new birth
[1:11:42] is what people thinks that it's just a
[1:11:44] knowledge that we're children of God
[1:11:48] then Jesus didn't have to
[1:11:49] die cuz Nicodemus heard it straight well
[1:11:53] we we've heard it straight by the
[1:11:54] prophet right so we don't need to be
[1:11:59] saved now I want you to show me a quote
[1:12:02] where he said you don't need to be
[1:12:04] saved there's a lot of difference in
[1:12:06] saying you don't need to be saved and
[1:12:09] saying you are always
[1:12:11] saved vast difference right in the
[1:12:15] statement well brother D let just one
[1:12:18] saying this way other saying now it's
[1:12:19] all the
[1:12:20] same well then you don't need salvation
[1:12:24] you don't need
[1:12:26] Jesus you spent your whole life in
[1:12:29] vain go home eat drink and be
[1:12:35] merry cuz if he always saved you don't
[1:12:38] even need to listen to The Prophet no
[1:12:39] more you done got the knowledge it
[1:12:41] always
[1:12:46] say Jesus just come to redeem
[1:12:50] that but you were saved from the
[1:12:53] beginning
[1:12:57] beginning when the predestination took
[1:13:00] place you
[1:13:02] saved from the beginning because you had
[1:13:06] eternal life to begin
[1:13:09] with he said well brother Dale that's
[1:13:11] vastly confusing to
[1:13:13] me but that's what most people
[1:13:19] believe that you had eternal life to
[1:13:21] begin with now
[1:13:24] H how many remembers in this series that
[1:13:27] I spent about four Services preaching on
[1:13:31] where the Prophet
[1:13:32] said if you have eternal life
[1:13:38] right you always was eternal
[1:13:43] right and that you cannot
[1:13:48] sin
[1:13:50] why because his
[1:13:52] seed remaineth in you and you cannot
[1:13:59] sin now he didn't say you didn't sin to
[1:14:01] start with cuz he said we was all
[1:14:03] Sinners that's right and he said we was
[1:14:06] all
[1:14:07] lost sir
[1:14:09] now go
[1:14:11] ahead you don't need a preacher to
[1:14:13] straighten that
[1:14:17] out right you got your own
[1:14:22] idea
[1:14:26] but check all the quotes we'll give you
[1:14:28] a few but check all the quotes about
[1:14:30] eternal
[1:14:32] life see I
[1:14:34] believe the eternal life that you have
[1:14:37] today always was eternal that's right
[1:14:42] but I believe there was a day we didn't
[1:14:44] have it that's
[1:14:46] right it was not a possession to you and
[1:14:49] I right it was in God's mind that's
[1:14:52] right amen
[1:14:54] so now you see where we're going with
[1:14:55] the seed if we get TI it'll be this
[1:14:57] evening where was the seed put our
[1:15:00] brother brother said put there before
[1:15:02] the foundation of the world
[1:15:08] Amen now be careful you'll go back to
[1:15:10] your Mormon doctorine see
[1:15:15] pre-existence but think about
[1:15:19] it if you are saved
[1:15:22] today
[1:15:23] which means eternal life now not just
[1:15:25] we're repented we're accepted Jesus
[1:15:28] Christ we're you know we're just kind of
[1:15:29] believing no no no no no no no talking
[1:15:32] about that
[1:15:33] okay if you truly believe you have
[1:15:35] eternal
[1:15:39] life in your soul then I can say your
[1:15:42] soul always was eternal that's by the
[1:15:45] eternal life
[1:15:50] right not because I was born with it
[1:15:58] right but somebody walk up here today
[1:16:01] and say and they really repent and want
[1:16:03] and they receive eternal
[1:16:05] life right
[1:16:07] here that person is just as Eternal in
[1:16:11] Soul as they'll ever be do you agree
[1:16:13] with that amen
[1:16:15] right well that eternal life had no
[1:16:22] beginning and I could tell the person
[1:16:24] then
[1:16:25] hey can you catch it you always was
[1:16:31] eternal but you bring somebody up here
[1:16:33] that ain't got the Holy Ghost in their
[1:16:34] heart to interpret that and you tell
[1:16:37] them they always was eternal and you
[1:16:38] watch the garbage cans that come out of
[1:16:40] it and you see them in this message
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:44] polygamy beamies hiams
[1:16:48] homosexualities
[1:16:51] perversions right in this message people
[1:16:56] oh I believe everything the prophet
[1:17:00] said won't you just be honest like a man
[1:17:02] was riding down the road I won't call
[1:17:03] his name but brother random was saying
[1:17:06] something to get something and his wife
[1:17:08] said see there brother Brown don't agree
[1:17:10] want you he just took the tape out slung
[1:17:11] it back he said ain't no man going to
[1:17:13] tell me what to
[1:17:15] believe why don't you be honest enough
[1:17:17] to do
[1:17:18] it it's like I told a man at my house
[1:17:21] one
[1:17:22] day you've heard me tell it but he said
[1:17:25] too much and I looked at him I said why
[1:17:27] don't you get out of the message or get
[1:17:30] in
[1:17:33] one you know what his
[1:17:38] wife said you're right brother
[1:17:42] tail do you think that converted
[1:17:45] him
[1:17:48] no no
[1:17:50] uhuh listen
[1:17:54] if you have eternal
[1:17:56] life go ahead let's read to it three
[1:17:58] fast all right number
[1:18:02] six taking from Ser we would see Jesus
[1:18:05] 64304 most of these are after The Seals
[1:18:08] some back and forth so you so he knew
[1:18:11] what he's talking about there he knew
[1:18:12] what he's talking about for the seal
[1:18:14] right just in case some people oh he got
[1:18:16] a revelation later you know that's what
[1:18:19] they're saying they're saying the new
[1:18:21] birth is no longer justification same
[1:18:23] Cas the baptism and the Holy Ghost
[1:18:24] brother random got a revelation later it
[1:18:26] was just a
[1:18:32] baptism right then you get upset with me
[1:18:35] for bringing out people's doctrines and
[1:18:37] think I'm against the people no I love
[1:18:40] everybody but I hate a garbage
[1:18:45] can I was drug out of it I know what it
[1:18:47] was I know what to take my own ideas and
[1:18:50] what I can do with
[1:18:51] it
[1:18:53] but also know there's a bride of Jesus
[1:18:55] Christ yes sir listen now if you were in
[1:18:58] his thinking at the beginning
[1:19:01] what if you got eternal life there's
[1:19:04] only one form of eternal life eternal
[1:19:07] life had no beginning and has no ending
[1:19:09] so if you have eternal life you were an
[1:19:12] attribute of God's
[1:19:14] thinking before there was anything but
[1:19:19] him that's how you have eternal life
[1:19:24] your form your shape and what you you're
[1:19:27] in now is just a
[1:19:30] negative right when you come up to
[1:19:33] around 20 23 the picture is taken in the
[1:19:36] certainly Tabernacle we have one already
[1:19:40] waiting what is eternal life go ahead
[1:19:44] number
[1:19:47] seven this is taken from who is this Mel
[1:19:50] chdc paragraph 48
[1:19:53] notice those who have tonight eternal
[1:19:56] life was with him and in
[1:19:59] him
[1:20:01] were in his
[1:20:05] thinking that doesn't say anything about
[1:20:07] us being back our little early does
[1:20:13] it before there was an angel star cherim
[1:20:16] or anything that's Eternal and if you
[1:20:18] have eternal life you always was right
[1:20:23] not your being
[1:20:25] here but the shape and form of the
[1:20:28] infinite God what are we you see you've
[1:20:31] been through these a lot brother Dale I
[1:20:32] know
[1:20:35] it let's read a couple more and then
[1:20:37] we'll quit and we'll take up this
[1:20:39] evening look at the next one wisdom
[1:20:41] versus Faith this and is
[1:20:44] 62401 cuz I believe he back there here I
[1:20:46] believe he knew what the truth was now
[1:20:48] if you have eternal life today you are
[1:20:51] in God
[1:20:53] what by God's being in
[1:20:57] you is that a
[1:20:59] sensable you're God's expressed thought
[1:21:02] we then don't listen to any reason lest
[1:21:06] your crown be taken and give to another
[1:21:08] don't take any reasons at all just
[1:21:10] believe what God Said is the truth and
[1:21:12] stay with it get the next
[1:21:20] one the voice of the sign 64
[1:21:24] 321 and there was a little woman a
[1:21:27] prostitute her her four life was up here
[1:21:32] up here was as black as it could
[1:21:35] be she was Ill famed but down in her
[1:21:38] heart she was predestinated to
[1:21:41] life he goes on explaining the things
[1:21:45] they were making fun and saying but she
[1:21:47] was saying I know when the Messiah
[1:21:50] cometh he said I'm he what did it do it
[1:21:55] cleaned out the Blackness and made it
[1:21:57] all white why there was a seed laying
[1:22:00] there a predestinated seed that was in
[1:22:03] the it was God's thought before the
[1:22:07] foundation of the
[1:22:09] world
[1:22:11] now I want to stop right there cuz this
[1:22:15] will be the thought we'll carry on this
[1:22:19] afternoon I just want to ask you simple
[1:22:22] question
[1:22:28] he said it made white it clinged out to
[1:22:30] Blackness made it all white right did
[1:22:33] she get the new birth right
[1:22:36] there is that the new birth he's talking
[1:22:45] about when Peter
[1:22:48] said by the anointing of the Holy
[1:22:51] Spirit th aren't the Christ the son of
[1:22:54] the Living
[1:22:57] God that was made alive to him wasn't it
[1:23:00] right did that give him the new birth
[1:23:05] no when the prophet spoke in the name of
[1:23:09] the
[1:23:11] Lord thousands of times of thus sayith
[1:23:14] the
[1:23:15] Lord and things were revealed to
[1:23:20] them did that give them eternal
[1:23:29] life I don't believe the little woman at
[1:23:31] the well went back to her prostitution
[1:23:33] job I'm not
[1:23:36] foolish but I do know one man that after
[1:23:39] he said th the Christ the son of the
[1:23:41] Living God that he winds up over our
[1:23:44] denying Jesus Christ and cursing while
[1:23:47] he's doing it don't look like too good
[1:23:49] of a candidate for a birth does it and I
[1:23:52] remember a little woman that was a
[1:23:55] carrier of the seed of
[1:23:59] God by saying be it unto me according to
[1:24:02] Thy word but she turns around and denies
[1:24:05] him
[1:24:06] being the Virgin
[1:24:11] birth you think she had the new
[1:24:13] birth I can quote it about her but I can
[1:24:17] also do it about Peter because Peter was
[1:24:20] one of them up in the upper room right
[1:24:23] so he had to go up there to get the new
[1:24:24] birth and he said now you women that say
[1:24:27] Mary is a mother of God he said she had
[1:24:29] to pull the upper room to get the Holy
[1:24:31] Ghost that's right not the 12 now she
[1:24:34] was then that 12 the upper room I'm
[1:24:36] talking about is the place where the
[1:24:39] Holy Ghost
[1:24:40] fell
[1:24:43] right but you see we say but but brother
[1:24:46] Dale I just believe we always
[1:24:48] was
[1:24:51] well
[1:24:54] what are you dealing with in God's
[1:24:57] thinking or in your
[1:25:02] thinking if we always was eternal we
[1:25:05] don't need eternal
[1:25:10] life poor
[1:25:12] Nicodemus he just couldn't understand
[1:25:14] all he had to do is accept what Jesus
[1:25:15] said right is that the way we preach
[1:25:19] it come on I've heard preachers preach
[1:25:23] the little woman at the
[1:25:24] well that seed Was Made
[1:25:29] Alive
[1:25:32] Heen but it didn't give her the new
[1:25:34] birth that's
[1:25:37] right now you argue the
[1:25:41] point why did she have to go to the
[1:25:43] upper room why did she have to get
[1:25:45] eternal
[1:25:47] life well she just went up there and
[1:25:49] found out she already had
[1:25:51] it that's
[1:25:53] good but that's them things that we read
[1:25:56] there a while ago of a
[1:25:58] hybrid
[1:26:04] Creeds you see if we have had come in
[1:26:07] the world with eternal life we don't
[1:26:08] need Jesus Christ that's
[1:26:11] right but brother Dale that's too simple
[1:26:14] that's just the way you do you I know it
[1:26:16] Ian you call me deep I call it
[1:26:20] simple simple things is
[1:26:23] truth if a equals b as brother hter used
[1:26:27] to say then that means b and a is of the
[1:26:31] same
[1:26:32] value
[1:26:35] right if you tell me you always was
[1:26:40] eternal then I'm going to tell you I
[1:26:43] don't believe
[1:26:47] it but if you tell me that God always
[1:26:50] was eternal I'm going to amen it it
[1:26:52] that's not a and
[1:26:55] b that's two different
[1:26:59] things well I'll just tell with what the
[1:27:02] prophet
[1:27:04] said that one poor brother told me one
[1:27:06] time he said I don't know whether I make
[1:27:08] it or not but said that Prophet said
[1:27:09] pray for my family he said I pray for
[1:27:12] his family all the time and he said I'm
[1:27:14] going to be there cuz I pray for his
[1:27:15] family I never tried to degrade that man
[1:27:18] down and and tell him that that wasn't
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:24] I I didn't do that cuz I'm I'm a human
[1:27:27] being you think I'm just constantly
[1:27:30] trying to destroy your
[1:27:32] Doctrine no I'm trying to save your
[1:27:37] soul who are you preaching to
[1:27:40] here you that just had that
[1:27:49] idea but if you always was eternal then
[1:27:51] you don't don't need anything
[1:27:54] else but if you believe you need a new
[1:27:57] birth then there's a lot in the word
[1:27:59] that's to be now some of you won't be
[1:28:03] here this evening so I'll go ahead and
[1:28:04] put in it of course you may watch it on
[1:28:05] the internet that's your
[1:28:07] business you may not so that's your
[1:28:10] business but you see I
[1:28:13] believe that we were not people before
[1:28:16] the foundation of the world right that's
[1:28:18] right not human beings not even spirits
[1:28:22] the prophet
[1:28:23] said we were only in God's
[1:28:29] mind now all I want to know is how to
[1:28:32] transmit that down to a human
[1:28:38] being you
[1:28:39] know if I transmit that down that well
[1:28:42] you always was eternal there's the
[1:28:49] quotes then you don't need Jesus
[1:28:56] all you needing far is to live in this
[1:28:58] world
[1:29:00] now see that's come
[1:29:04] on I told you 40 years ago 30 something
[1:29:10] 40 I said if you think the two Soul
[1:29:12] Doctrine is deceiving I said you wait
[1:29:14] till the day come I said they're going
[1:29:16] to get
[1:29:18] closer closer and
[1:29:20] closer
[1:29:23] and you look at it
[1:29:28] now like come on I'm
[1:29:33] honest a little bit arrogant a little
[1:29:36] bit hateful and a whole lot
[1:29:41] sarcastic but what about the
[1:29:47] word what about when Jesus said you must
[1:29:49] be born
[1:29:50] again
[1:29:54] if you're not born again you're
[1:29:59] lost that's right we quote a lot I'll
[1:30:02] end it with this come on Brothers we
[1:30:04] quote a lot of what brother R says but
[1:30:06] we think about it he said there's no
[1:30:08] such thing as a white black bird or a
[1:30:11] black white
[1:30:20] bird quote that a lot don't
[1:30:24] we but what was he
[1:30:27] saying think on these things let's Stand
[1:30:30] Together come on
[1:30:35] brother you say Brother D I just I'm
[1:30:38] listening to you I love to listen to you
[1:30:40] but you just don't make me feel
[1:30:44] right praise the
[1:30:47] Lord I didn't no feelings had anything
[1:30:49] to do with
[1:30:50] it yeah yeah
[1:30:54] but anything's not got life in it is
[1:31:02] dead if I'm staying with the word I
[1:31:05] believe that the life is in the
[1:31:09] word the only person that's going to
[1:31:11] kill is a person that don't agree with
[1:31:13] the
[1:31:14] word there is
[1:31:17] death think on these
[1:31:20] things we'll get to it this afternoon
[1:31:24] the prophet of God said that seed was
[1:31:25] put in you before the foundation of the
[1:31:31] world I agree with what he says amen but
[1:31:35] that's what I don't understand church I
[1:31:38] don't understand it I don't understand
[1:31:41] that a minister will stand up and take
[1:31:43] every quote right around and say and say
[1:31:45] come and show me bring your quotes and
[1:31:48] let's lay them down and let's talk about
[1:31:51] it
[1:31:52] to give you a quote that says you always
[1:31:54] was eternal when you're
[1:31:56] explaining that that would only could be
[1:31:58] in God's
[1:32:04] mind but yet who wants that that
[1:32:07] way no you'd rather have it
[1:32:10] twisted to make you feel like it feel
[1:32:13] like
[1:32:20] what
[1:32:22] go ahead what we got 3:20 let's sing
[1:32:26] anybody has an need your all is
[1:32:27] open i' like to stay here longer than
[1:32:32] man's a lot days and watch the fleeing
[1:32:40] changes make sure you know what you're
[1:32:45] doing make sure you know what you're
[1:32:47] listening
[1:32:50] to oh yes whether it be here or whether
[1:32:54] it be anywhere
[1:32:57] else see if it goes with the
[1:33:08] word like a man told me one day one day
[1:33:11] he said brother Dale you ain't nothing
[1:33:13] but a
[1:33:17] Baptist where I come
[1:33:20] from you wouldn't understand
[1:33:23] him unless you knew what he's talking
[1:33:25] about and I knew exactly what he's
[1:33:27] talking
[1:33:28] about brother said you better leave that
[1:33:31] Baptist alone with the
[1:33:33] word he said he'll rip you to pieces
[1:33:36] with
[1:33:37] it why cuz he dwells on that letter and
[1:33:40] the thoughts everything right in that
[1:33:43] word he just lays it in
[1:33:48] there and he can explain a lot of it
[1:33:54] that's what he told me he said you're
[1:33:57] just a Baptist you can just put it
[1:33:59] together and explain
[1:34:01] it well you know that didn't make me
[1:34:06] mad that man preached probably 10 or 15
[1:34:09] years more here with
[1:34:12] me I throw him out cuz he thought that
[1:34:15] about
[1:34:17] me ask him one day I said brother
[1:34:23] for what do you think about me
[1:34:30] now he said well I got to
[1:34:32] admit it's a little more than just a
[1:34:38] Badness but you see he couldn't touch
[1:34:40] that
[1:34:43] word that's why when I preach I'm
[1:34:45] willing to listen to anybody oh yes but
[1:34:49] don't come and tell me I thank
[1:34:52] I want the word I want the prophet's
[1:34:59] message not my thought or your
[1:35:03] thought I want to see it come together
[1:35:06] from Genesis to
[1:35:13] Revelation
[1:35:15] godive I'm over that many of us are over
[1:35:18] that God's a lot of days and 70 years
[1:35:22] and there's a lot of us already over
[1:35:26] that
[1:35:31] right I'm believing that there's a whole
[1:35:34] lot of Heaven here to take NE
[1:35:38] there but Heaven is a revealed
[1:35:41] word Prophet said Heaven consists of the
[1:35:49] word can we believe it
[1:35:53] your dismiss pray one for another
