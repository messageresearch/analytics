[3:47] let's go over to into 2nd Peter 1 it
[3:57] says Simon Peter a servant an apostle of
[4:00] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[4:02] like precious faith with us through the
[4:04] righteousness of God and our Savior
[4:06] Jesus Christ grace and peace be on to

[4:12] Jesus our Lord according as his divine
[4:15] divine power the given to us all things
[4:18] that pertain unto life and godliness
[4:20] through the knowledge of him that have
[4:23] called us to glory in virtue
[4:25] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[4:27] great and precious promises
[4:29] that by these you might be partakers of
[4:32] the divine nature having escaped the
[4:34] corruption that is in the world through
[4:36] lust and beside this giving all giving
[4:40] all diligence beside this now giving all
[4:42] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[4:45] to virtue or knowledge a knowledge
[4:47] temperance and we're going through but
[4:49] we're just going through the part there
[4:51] of virtue tonight so you you may be
[4:54] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[4:57] reading of the word we as I said we had
[5:00] a good time over the weekend and enjoyed
[5:02] the brother and and everything and we
[5:04] didn't discuss anything and all in he he
[5:07] came right in on the the preaching on
[5:10] the the things of the Statue of a
[5:12] perfect man so I hope that was good for
[5:15] you and and giving understanding and you
[5:18] know to follow in into the message that
[5:22] we're trying to bring all right now
[5:25] we've had this is 27 messages so far and
[5:34] we're gonna start the Lord Williams we
[5:36] tend to not on beginning the actual
[5:39] virtues and see how each one lays in
[5:43] order and what they're doing but the
[5:45] main thing I want you to understand I
[5:49] want to ask you the question you know do
[5:54] you realize what the Word of God is far
[6:00] in this last days as it don't upon you
[6:03] of what it is to be or what is to take
[6:07] place see we know that according to
[6:13] Malachi 4 that God is supposed to
[6:16] restore the faith of the original
[6:19] Apostolic fathers to the little bride in
[6:23] the end time all right now but do we
[6:26] really realize that and look at that as
[6:29] what's taking place are we looking back
[6:33] to it somewhere or something are looking
[6:36] forward to some other point and missing
[6:39] what's taking place now that's the main
[6:42] point I want
[6:43] to think about I want to dis ask you the
[6:46] simple question you know do you realize
[6:50] the hour that we're living you realize
[6:54] the time that we're living upon this
[6:56] earth it's the time of the opening of
[6:59] the Word of God to the bride of Jesus
[7:02] Christ to get her ready to go out of
[7:05] here in a rapture you know alright in
[7:09] doing that then there's things that must
[7:11] transpire you know and and we we believe
[7:18] that and we're looking forward to a lot
[7:21] of things to transpire I mean I'm I'm
[7:24] one that looks forward and backward but
[7:27] I try to stand in the middle of where
[7:30] I'm at because that way I can look
[7:32] backwards and forward you know if I move
[7:34] forward I can't look forward i'm i'll be
[7:37] looking backwards or something you know
[7:39] it won't work but the point i want you
[7:42] to think about I want to ask you just a
[7:44] simple question do you realize and do
[7:50] you really believe it and put all of
[7:52] your thoughts and your hopes and and
[7:58] everything that this message was
[8:02] delivered unto you and I to bring us to
[8:06] the stature of a perfect man all right
[8:09] because that was the part that was lost
[8:13] the not the new birth no see that's
[8:18] where we get that confused in our
[8:20] thinking a lot of times it wasn't the
[8:23] new birth that was lost down through the
[8:25] ages each age had the new birth all
[8:29] right
[8:30] it was Christ in each age to bring forth
[8:33] in that age and and he in having that
[8:35] but what was lost was these virtues that
[8:39] the disciples had and then when you come
[8:43] over you got you can't confirm pom worm
[8:45] locust caterpillar now as they come
[8:47] forth and ate the tree down and you know
[8:51] brought it to a position to her that
[8:57] no longer was the church walking in the
[9:01] direct light and understanding of the
[9:04] original of the day of Pentecost right
[9:08] that's the point I want you to think
[9:10] about is to make sure you understand
[9:14] that I mean we've tried you know after
[9:17] many messages to try to get that point
[9:20] across to us it's not to just talk about
[9:24] these things it's not to just discuss it
[9:30] and all like that we've done that in
[9:32] organized religion they're doing that
[9:35] now they're discussing whatever would
[9:38] you say they're talking about the Word
[9:41] of God and you see great moves and
[9:44] different things taking place among
[9:46] organized religion and and they're
[9:49] they're just not sitting there dried up
[9:51] they're trying to move on but they don't
[9:54] know how to move on because that's what
[9:57] we've we've come to all right now get to
[10:02] get the point of I thought if we realize
[10:05] that something has been taken away you
[10:12] know then we must realize what that is
[10:16] okay and then if it's taken away and
[10:20] promised to be restored all right then
[10:25] we must look at the fact of seeing that
[10:28] it is being restored not you know way
[10:32] out sunder it's now all right so then we
[10:36] read the Bible you know of Melaka
[10:38] forward we see that God promised but he
[10:42] told the cankerworm palm warm locust
[10:44] caterpillar would eat the church down
[10:46] but then it would come to a promise of a
[10:50] restoration back to the faith of the
[10:54] father's all right now what is the faith
[10:57] of the father's it's the revelation that
[11:00] the Apostles had of Jesus Christ back
[11:06] there and it was brought forth you know
[11:09] their reach
[11:10] faith understanding he and they had the
[11:16] truth of of one God water baptism no
[11:21] eternal hail we didn't have you didn't
[11:23] have to wait until these you know you
[11:25] didn't have to wait for the Prophet to
[11:27] bring these things but like the one God
[11:30] - water baptism with no eternal hell the
[11:32] things like that the Apostles taught
[11:34] these things they taught of
[11:39] predestination they taught of all of
[11:42] those things it was lined up back there
[11:44] with them alright see all right then if
[11:49] that's true then it has to be lined up
[11:51] in you and me to be restored back to us
[11:56] alright let's see do you realize that
[11:59] that's what's taking place or is it just
[12:01] a going to church and being good you
[12:05] know is it something like that that
[12:09] we're looking forward to you know are we
[12:13] looking to a point to think well maybe
[12:15] one of these days there's going to be
[12:17] some great something take place you know
[12:21] and the great movements and great things
[12:24] will transpire is that what we're
[12:26] looking for
[12:27] well that's well and good and all right
[12:33] you know no problems with nobody the
[12:37] problem I have is with all of us not
[12:39] being seeing what's taking place now
[12:43] right now you know
[12:46] all right see we can look back and see
[12:49] what took place we see the faith of the
[12:52] fathers was dark we see the Prophet come
[12:54] to bring us the message to restore that
[12:57] back to us all right we can see it in
[13:01] his ministry and him and walking in the
[13:05] light all right we can see all of that
[13:08] right then there's things that will
[13:11] transpire you know take place in this
[13:16] end time because there's got to be a
[13:19] change of the body there's got to be a
[13:21] lot of things to transpire all right
[13:23] we've got a
[13:24] a lot to look forward to but now let's
[13:27] don't do this let's don't settle down on
[13:32] thinking about what has been but now
[13:36] don't settle down and not move forward
[13:39] into what that we see I'm a firm
[13:42] believer in that like I've always told
[13:44] you there the other week when we were
[13:46] talking about the revival I've always
[13:48] it's always been in my heart since
[13:51] hearing this message and the Prophet and
[13:54] speaking the way he did of a revival and
[13:57] not to be any more of these worldwide
[13:59] sweeping revivals the next one of those
[14:02] will be to Israel through the two
[14:04] witnesses all right we got that right
[14:07] then we have the understanding but I've
[14:10] always believed in a revival I've always
[14:13] believed it because the Prophet said you
[14:16] know that the bride hasn't had a revival
[14:18] yet well now then he's not talking about
[14:23] Oh a world sweeping revival you know
[14:30] that's not the point but it's a word
[14:33] revival and I've been in that ever since
[14:36] I've been in this message it's always
[14:37] been a wonderful thing to me to be able
[14:40] to read the Word of God and to think
[14:43] about you and I being able to understand
[14:48] what the prophets and things that's hard
[14:52] to look into it you realize that that
[14:56] you have an understanding of God in the
[15:01] way that the prophets were not capable
[15:03] of reaching to that position and the
[15:08] great people down through time
[15:12] even to the apostles and things that you
[15:16] are going to go beyond them into the
[15:19] basis they never reach the change of the
[15:22] body right see the great Apostle Paul
[15:27] that could speak over the change in the
[15:29] mantra but yet he never attained to it
[15:33] we seem to think about that you and I
[15:35] have the opportunity to be able to walk
[15:41] in that place is a great thing we'll see
[15:45] that's the kind of revival I'm looking
[15:48] for that's the kind of point that I've
[15:50] always tried to get you to talk about or
[15:53] see is the opening of God's Word see
[15:58] then in realizing that knowing that if
[16:01] we believe that the church was eaten
[16:05] down and must be restored you know the
[16:09] word to the bride well alright then what
[16:13] was eaten down what we call the statue
[16:18] of a perfect man alright going on in to
[16:23] adoption and those things that the
[16:27] Apostles talked of during the dark ages
[16:32] of the it was just eating away to her
[16:37] that it was no longer the goal or the
[16:40] drive of the church it had just become
[16:43] to a dried up state of going to church
[16:46] and being good right and all of that's
[16:50] well and good but that's not the whole
[16:53] story you know you go over here and you
[16:57] set out in this church and and you you
[16:59] just forget a few little things about
[17:02] this that or the other about what you're
[17:03] doing and you sit down and listen to
[17:05] these people they're talking about God
[17:07] they're talking about great things
[17:09] happening they're talking about healings
[17:12] they're talking about you know they're
[17:16] not just sitting there dried up with
[17:17] nothing they're talking about those
[17:22] things well that's what we're doing but
[17:24] that's where the prophets said that's
[17:26] what it had
[17:26] wound up to be it had wound up he said
[17:30] to be just a church-going people without
[17:34] any goal or drive whatsoever to move on
[17:38] other than to just be good Christians
[17:42] you know he said well that what else
[17:45] what you won't then good Christians well
[17:50] if the Prophet was right he wasn't
[17:54] throwing off on people that were good
[17:56] Christians but he said that's where they
[17:59] missed it at was thinking that was it
[18:03] remember what he preached on that he
[18:05] said that's where Pentecost failed
[18:08] that's where the the Pentecostals failed
[18:11] in the in their their point that they
[18:13] thought it was all dire it was finished
[18:16] it was what they had was it and he said
[18:21] no he said you just got started well see
[18:29] you're telling people that are having
[18:30] and listening you don't think like
[18:33] they're you're telling people I brought
[18:35] around it was telling people that was
[18:37] having signs and wonders every day and
[18:42] we write the Pentecostal people were in
[18:47] the move and thing and having great
[18:49] signs and wonders and you're telling
[18:53] them that that's not all of it right
[19:00] was that what he was telling them that's
[19:02] not all of it we need to go on because
[19:06] that's not just what the disciples had
[19:09] you know we've got to get back to that
[19:13] place of the world and the things they
[19:17] had and see then by looking at it and
[19:23] seeing the Word of God unveiled in our
[19:25] day to show us where we're at and what's
[19:31] taking place all right
[19:34] now I know I'm I'm cutting it dry and
[19:37] thoughts but I'm wanting you to think
[19:40] I want you to think one time do you
[19:43] realize this is the end time do you
[19:50] realize that you realized there is not
[19:53] another move of God there is not another
[19:58] thing to come another revival another
[20:01] this Saturday we're in the last days
[20:05] we're in the finishing up of all things
[20:11] but we have to realize that sure as I
[20:15] said there's things to take place we're
[20:18] looking forward to things but yet are we
[20:21] looking at what's taking place as being
[20:24] what it is to make way for that whatever
[20:28] is to come now think about this for a
[20:31] second whatever is to come there must be
[20:37] a background right form a right teaching
[20:46] right right
[20:49] there must be something set in motion to
[20:53] be prepared for that when it does come
[20:55] that's all I've ever told how many times
[20:59] have you heard me say you can't go to
[21:02] the bus depot and wait on the plane just
[21:06] get worth of bus depots that and wait on
[21:09] God get into the word if we're looking
[21:14] forward to a change of the body he said
[21:17] once don't see nothing going on with us
[21:19] that's not going to bring you to that
[21:22] that's not going to bring us to the
[21:25] position but to come back to the
[21:28] original faith that those disciples had
[21:34] is that word now listen I'm trying to
[21:42] explain something I'm thinking about it
[21:43] today if I can Lord how can I get that
[21:45] to the people
[21:49] I don't believe that we're getting right
[21:55] of what we're talking about like the
[21:56] statue of a perfect man and the
[21:58] adoptions and the things I believe that
[22:02] we're either putting it behind or we're
[22:05] pushing it forward away from us and and
[22:10] we either making it too big to attain
[22:15] are too small to overlook now that's
[22:22] that's the whole point of what I'm
[22:23] talking about
[22:24] see we're overlooking what's taking
[22:29] place and to see the hour at a time that
[22:36] we're living is the greatest opportunity
[22:39] there is that a church could ever have
[22:45] to be able to believe in God and living
[22:49] where we're at I believe in a Christian
[22:54] life I believe in living a Christian
[22:58] life but I don't believe that we're
[23:04] looking at a Christian life in the way
[23:05] that we should that we're looking at it
[23:09] as a happiness a joyous or this that or
[23:16] the other you know a move of feelings of
[23:21] emotional things we're looking at it on
[23:25] that level instead of looking at it the
[23:30] way God is trying to bring it and I've
[23:34] tried to explain this over and over what
[23:39] would you do if we look at there far the
[23:42] apostles and we look at the great things
[23:46] happening well what would happen if you
[23:50] were able to reverse the situation and
[23:53] put those apostles where we are you
[24:00] don't
[24:01] see the point of that of what I'm
[24:03] thinking what if you brought him down
[24:06] here where we're at
[24:08] they had a pharisees and the sadducees
[24:12] organization to fight against and we've
[24:16] got ten thousand demons knock come on
[24:23] now is it the Prophet even told us on on
[24:27] the message that those demons was loosed
[24:29] on the bride to drive her to the message
[24:33] of the hour
[24:34] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[24:38] I can't even calculate test some says
[24:41] that's two hundred million I don't know
[24:43] I can't get enough numbers together to
[24:45] come out worse at but get what I'm
[24:49] talking about what if they were up
[24:52] hearing us back guard would they be like
[25:03] we are or would they be so over joyous
[25:08] and don't you know no I don't look for
[25:12] something like that people want a great
[25:16] revival of feeling good and good things
[25:20] and enjoy not like a everybody loves
[25:22] that the presence of God but what about
[25:26] those things on anointed ones they can
[25:29] have it on their spirit and rejoice and
[25:33] shout in glory hallelujah right and be
[25:38] still lost
[25:46] you understand what I'm saying what if
[25:51] we could trade places with them and let
[25:53] them come down here they they'd be real
[25:58] quick to tell you saying let's swap back
[26:00] go will face the lines and and the
[26:04] dungeons and the killings and the things
[26:10] over what y'all have in the face so you
[26:15] realize every day is a demon battle but
[26:18] a run said those I'm quoting him that he
[26:21] said what they used daily to overcome
[26:24] it's the same thing you use daily to
[26:27] overcome it's the same holy spirit
[26:32] what's your point brother there I'm not
[26:35] looking for something to break loose
[26:38] into such a joyous festivity of shouting
[26:43] glory hallelujah I wish that was true
[26:46] I've never looked at it like that I'm
[26:49] looking at the word opening and as the
[26:52] word opening it settles within our souls
[26:55] and our being something that Satan
[26:58] cannot take away from us something that
[27:04] you can be anchored in and that will
[27:08] bring joy unspeakable and full of glory
[27:11] to you see maybe you don't understand me
[27:15] on that sets I try to explain something
[27:18] and as I do I know that I get people
[27:20] confused I'm not an emotional type of a
[27:25] person but yet within me there's more
[27:28] emotions than anybody in this building
[27:32] because I know what I rejoice about
[27:36] I rejoice over the opening of God's Word
[27:40] that's my joy that's my daily thing
[27:44] that's my point of Lord help me open my
[27:49] eyes I want to see what God is I was
[27:57] thinking about him so much the other day
[27:58] till I was just watching him walk down
[28:00] a road you know you said well what do
[28:05] you want I just tell it like it is
[28:07] that's what I saw but see I'm I'm a
[28:12] point trying to get a point to you of
[28:15] what is it to be a Christian and are you
[28:21] looking for the statue of a perfect man
[28:23] to bring you to a great joy and a great
[28:27] thing beyond and and do away with all
[28:30] your troubles and all of your problems
[28:32] and heartaches if that's what you're
[28:35] looking for I think we're missing the
[28:37] statue of a pretty man by a whole lot
[28:39] because I always thought the closer we
[28:42] get to God the worst Satan gets after us
[28:49] you know brother dae-ho I'm just not as
[28:53] happy as I used to be I'm just you know
[28:59] the joy is just not in my heart
[29:02] that used to be there why well we're in
[29:12] the end we're in the finishing up of all
[29:15] of these things we're in the point of
[29:18] should be the most joyous people in the
[29:20] world why should we be sad about
[29:27] anything we have the word we have the
[29:34] holy spirit to quicken that word and we
[29:41] know what to look forward to it's
[29:50] adoption and the statute of perfect man
[29:52] the same thing to you the growth
[29:56] development of Christianity but not
[29:59] growth development of a whole lot more
[30:05] emotions
[30:10] because you see Satan can impersonate
[30:12] that he can bring the emotions to you he
[30:15] can bring those things to you but is the
[30:20] word the important thing Lulla they just
[30:27] word word word word word well that's all
[30:30] I've ever been so they don't need to be
[30:31] in nothing else you know I'll take that
[30:34] part and to stay with it because that's
[30:36] what I've always been I've always been
[30:39] one to want to understand God's Word not
[30:44] intellectually understand it not to read
[30:48] it more than you read it not to know it
[30:51] by head knowledge we'll get to that when
[30:53] we get to knowledge and what knowledge
[30:55] really is you realize the only knowledge
[31:00] there is worth anything is God's
[31:02] knowledge holy ghost' knowledge that's
[31:06] the only that's how simple it is holy
[31:08] ghost' knowledge is the greatest of all
[31:13] but yet do you do you follow me of
[31:16] understanding do you really see what's
[31:19] taking place in this day or are you just
[31:22] sitting and wondering what's going on
[31:24] well I just don't see that and I just
[31:26] don't see that I don't see that what are
[31:32] you looking for well brother that well
[31:37] now you've got some reason for
[31:38] everything you do right I mean we all
[31:41] got a reason
[31:43] what's your reason what's your thoughts
[31:48] well I think it ought to be this way
[31:50] well okay you know what I've always said
[31:54] if you think something around this
[31:58] church or to be changed when are you
[32:01] gonna start doing it right now I've put
[32:09] it back in your life ain't it you think
[32:12] well we need to shout more that's what
[32:14] I've been selling pastor so don't worry
[32:15] about it and I've been with people you
[32:18] know all these years and they say well
[32:20] we need to have more emotions
[32:23] and to tell you the God's honest truth
[32:26] I've talked to people and say we need
[32:29] more emotion and there was a drives
[32:31] person in the whole building the deadest
[32:33] person was the one that was wanting to
[32:37] do you know won't fell emotional and
[32:39] they're dead if you want emotions work
[32:44] on it if you want to join us happy time
[32:49] work on it start doing it yourself you
[32:52] remember what happened with a lady that
[32:54] was cleaning the church and she just
[32:55] cleaned it in wiping the seats and Lord
[32:58] bless his person Lord bless this person
[33:00] you know what it started revival in the
[33:02] whole church if you want to see
[33:07] something moving get up do it but what I
[33:12] hate is the fact of people will notice
[33:16] ain't nothing going on with you're dead
[33:17] if church is around well you know what
[33:19] if you're the one that saying that
[33:21] you're the deadest person in the
[33:23] building brother though yeah yeah I know
[33:28] it I'm hateful and arrogant and
[33:30] everything in the world but is it true
[33:40] we were here one time remodeling a
[33:43] little bit in the church and and we had
[33:45] got to a place we had to change some
[33:47] things around here and we were
[33:50] downstairs and we've got something to
[33:52] eat and we were sitting there eating and
[33:54] you know and everybody was talking about
[33:57] what we need to do this well we need to
[34:01] do this you know they wouldn't agreeing
[34:04] upon what we needed to get up and go do
[34:05] they wanted need to do this we need to
[34:09] do this and don't need to do that well
[34:12] after a while they asked big he said
[34:14] were Sam said he's up your honor doing
[34:16] what he's gonna do cuz I ain't gonna sit
[34:22] around and talk about it I'm gonna get
[34:24] up and go do it that's what we all need
[34:28] that to me you know maybe that's trying
[34:33] to explain a point but it is I'm not
[34:36] you know to be over joyously half in and
[34:40] in the Lord and worship it and
[34:42] everything is wonderful but if it's all
[34:47] of my cup then it ain't worth it but if
[34:53] it's because of something with inside of
[34:55] you and that's what I'm asking what do
[35:02] you think is it to talk about I will
[35:09] restore the years of the cankerworm
[35:11] locusts the caterpillar pom worming now
[35:15] what are you expecting to take place you
[35:20] have some reason some thought in your
[35:22] mind everybody in the building have some
[35:23] thought or concept about what they think
[35:26] it should be or what it is or what what
[35:33] are we trying to put that into action
[35:35] right or are we just sitting down
[35:42] blaming everybody else that's pretty
[35:45] easy in there to blame everybody else
[35:49] for something not being done once you
[35:53] get up and go do it right you know you
[35:58] know what I'm saying
[35:59] get up get it get it to working you know
[36:02] you want something change get out go do
[36:03] it well they won't listen to me they
[36:10] don't like my ideas well you ever tried
[36:13] putting them in action we might not know
[36:16] your ideas you put them in action
[36:18] listen Church I'm trying to tell you one
[36:22] time if we're looking for something to
[36:26] come that's going to be a great joyous
[36:30] you know move and etc and things like
[36:33] that
[36:34] of going in to the time of the change of
[36:37] the body I don't look like that
[36:39] I look it as an everyday action and a
[36:47] final reaction brother mote used to have
[36:49] a good point
[36:50] you know I mean you walking up the rungs
[36:53] of a ladder it's the same distance it's
[36:56] wrong if it's made correctly you see
[37:00] it's the same distance your steps out
[37:01] here brother Geary they're these
[37:03] carpenters can tell you there's a
[37:05] certain set on that step and your
[37:09] insurance in your home probably a lot of
[37:13] you that's got a basement if they come
[37:16] and check your insurance they would tell
[37:18] you about it if they checked your home
[37:22] it's got to be so much up and so much
[37:25] out each one and it's got to be precise
[37:28] you know why do you know why that those
[37:34] steps has to be made precise to be
[37:36] covered by insurance because your human
[37:41] mind is set and if it's set to weather
[37:48] this up five inches out seven inches
[37:51] every what it is your mind sets that in
[37:53] the motion and you go to a set of steps
[37:58] that's out of motion you'll stumble
[37:59] you'll hit he said I know you talked to
[38:05] these brothers that are carpenters they
[38:08] can cancel your insurance over the pitch
[38:11] of your basement or your sub stars steps
[38:18] because the human mind is set to that
[38:22] exact movement and you can trip and fall
[38:27] then what are you talking about I'm
[38:30] talking about every day in our Christian
[38:33] life walk every day the same walk every
[38:41] day the same be happy every day rejoice
[38:48] every day would be the same every day
[38:55] see then that way the Statue of a
[38:59] perfect man our adoption is not some
[39:02] action
[39:03] our reaction of an individual it's a
[39:09] growth development in the Word of God
[39:16] right it's growth development because
[39:21] what was taken away the word was taken
[39:27] away and Satan made us a set of steps
[39:30] without it being in precise order and
[39:33] his calls the stumbling is involving but
[39:41] if we get it all in order and walk
[39:45] according to the disciples are another
[39:48] word according to the Word of God then
[39:53] it'll come out to fit all the way
[39:55] through the printer Branham says a lot
[40:00] of things that really Oh forgive me for
[40:06] the terminologies we don't have common
[40:08] sense enough to explain what I see but
[40:11] brother branham a lot of times says a
[40:13] lot of things that are really confusing
[40:18] now unit of read norm drum Tomba you
[40:22] that ain't read you just think I'm
[40:24] trying to make some garbage can you that
[40:27] are well read no I know exactly what I'm
[40:29] saying is true but you that are not well
[40:31] read you're confused you that are well
[40:37] read in the message no brother Brennan
[40:39] says a lot of things in the same verse
[40:41] you'll say something in the same verse
[40:43] see or say something sounds like it's
[40:45] totally contrary right in the same
[40:51] sentence well he can't be that confused
[40:57] but a lot of times he's explaining
[41:02] something in terminologies to try to
[41:05] help us like in the stature of a perfect
[41:12] man and it
[41:15] into the basis of you know looking at
[41:19] the word that we are to be partakers of
[41:23] his divine nature that we just read do
[41:32] you realize in that then you've got to
[41:34] cover that in two parts to understand it
[41:41] because to be partakers of his divine
[41:44] nature is the new birth it's the new
[41:50] birth to be partakers of his divine
[41:53] nature but then you're just getting into
[41:56] the body to where you can become
[41:58] partakers of his divine nature Rutter
[42:04] brenell covers for takers of his divine
[42:07] nature but then he comes over to
[42:13] positioning Christ and he says after
[42:18] you're born again into the body then you
[42:21] become partakers of his divine nature
[42:28] now that's two things one is that the
[42:33] new birth is a partaker of the divine
[42:34] nature the next is in the body of Christ
[42:39] in the growth development then you
[42:41] become a partaker of his divine nature
[42:44] so you're kidding to the stature of a
[42:47] perfect land that's what I'm asking the
[42:51] question do you understand do you
[42:55] understand the stature of a perfect man
[42:59] because there's nowhere in the statute
[43:01] of a perfect man that brother branham
[43:03] will define something like this well
[43:05] you've got this here but when you get
[43:07] these other things boy you're gonna be
[43:09] happy you're gonna be he never expresses
[43:12] it read the book
[43:21] he doesn't describe that the Christian
[43:26] you know in the in the becoming a new
[43:30] birth the difference between it and a
[43:35] growth development in Christianity he
[43:37] doesn't define that a lot he just makes
[43:40] the statement and see then that way we
[43:48] have to become partakers of his divine
[43:51] nature by the new birth that we received
[43:55] Jesus Christ into our soul but then that
[43:57] just starts it because that's what he
[44:00] was telling those Pentecostals see they
[44:04] were saying we've got the new birth he
[44:06] agreed with him they were saying we've
[44:09] got this and now look what we've got
[44:11] we've gotten a great ladder rain he said
[44:14] nonsense he said you had to form a rain
[44:18] yet he said you've got to have the form
[44:25] of rain for you have the latter rain and
[44:27] said what it is you're just a bunch of
[44:29] babies he didn't decrease you neither on
[44:34] to make him lost he made them to the
[44:36] point of what they were babies and that
[44:43] they needed a growth development to
[44:47] become mature Christians you see that's
[44:55] what I'm trying to say to you do you
[44:57] understand what the new birth is have I
[45:01] spent enough time preaching on the new
[45:03] birth to get you to see that it's the
[45:05] person of Jesus Christ coming and living
[45:08] in you that changes your very nature to
[45:13] his nature we get that new birth is just
[45:17] a baby have we spent enough time into
[45:21] that to understand it then it just makes
[45:24] you a baby
[45:28] see the Pentecostals time with oh we all
[45:30] got it we got it all where we live he
[45:33] said no you don't have it he said you
[45:35] just come to the place to get him
[45:36] started
[45:38] was he T Christianizing them no was he
[45:43] telling them they were lost no get me
[45:47] the book the Titans showed me where he
[45:48] was telling though son look at him tell
[45:51] him you're right you've got these things
[45:54] right that's it now what we need is the
[46:00] statue of a perfect man and to do that
[46:07] we're going to have to have the word
[46:10] reveal to us the word the disciples had
[46:21] he's got to be in the bride for her to
[46:24] be able to attain unto what they had
[46:29] adoptions tax with perfect men
[46:31] manifested sons of God whatever the
[46:33] terminology is you want to use
[46:38] you see church we don't want to belittle
[46:44] something and make it too little but we
[46:49] don't want to make it too big till you
[46:51] can't attain unto it because that's what
[46:59] people say well brother deal I've got
[47:01] the new birth praise God
[47:09] I've got it just like today at Pentecost
[47:11] okay praise God but that's not the way
[47:19] the Prophet would cover it he covered
[47:21] getting the new birth first and then
[47:24] obtaining to the day of Pentecost and
[47:26] what they had a restoration I don't I
[47:34] don't get you all right listen if we
[47:41] have to be partakers of his divine
[47:43] nature then how do we become partakers
[47:48] of it you're gonna start in a new birth
[47:56] you remember elements with time we spent
[47:58] with brother around and said how faith
[48:00] and be born again he said then these are
[48:04] the things God expects you to add and
[48:12] see then what we look at it as something
[48:14] that's to be added you know some ad or
[48:19] something it looks like some great big
[48:21] something in front of us but then he'd
[48:24] make it so simple right
[48:31] you rented our supposed to read over and
[48:34] over what is the word virtue mean those
[48:41] we're to be protectors of his divine
[48:43] nature and to do that we're going to
[48:45] have to have his virtues what are the
[48:52] virtues of God
[48:58] we can call it the gifts you can go
[49:00] through that that's fine we did we took
[49:02] parts and show it but what is it talking
[49:06] about when you come down to we need to
[49:08] be partakers of these divine natures
[49:15] this to become protectors of the word
[49:18] because only by eating the word can we
[49:21] become anything
[49:26] see that's why I stay after you about
[49:29] listening to tapes and reading and
[49:31] praying because that way is the only way
[49:39] we'll ever be anything in God cause now
[49:47] you remember what the Prophet said try
[49:51] to get to the point
[49:53] he said now virtue he said we've got to
[49:58] have it and said it's his divine nature
[50:04] that we've got to have now how do you
[50:08] get His divine nature well I just get
[50:15] born again in brother Dale it's
[50:17] automatic see that's there if we throw
[50:19] that it's just an automatic and that's
[50:23] quote for the Prophet but what does it
[50:26] mean what if he talking about that it's
[50:27] automatic I thought that we had
[50:35] established through the message of the
[50:37] hour of and read it enough from you know
[50:41] the church age book 327 I think it is in
[50:46] it where he says this messenger of
[50:49] Malachi for Luke 17 13 I would do two
[50:52] things 1 turn the hearts of the children
[50:53] back to the faith of the fathers to
[50:56] divine revealed the thunders which is
[50:58] revelation contained in the seven seals
[51:00] alright then I thought that we had the
[51:04] at the ability now to be able to attain
[51:08] unto these things
[51:11] you didn't ever think well how can we
[51:14] get them we need these virtues
[51:16] if you read the statue of perfect man
[51:18] you know brother Owen said we've got to
[51:20] have these virtues even puts it to the
[51:23] rat sure well not if we've got to have
[51:27] these virtues how do we get them so we
[51:33] know that it's true getting to the
[51:36] original faith that they had that's the
[51:40] part it's being automatic the part is
[51:42] being automatic is when you yields
[51:45] yourself to God and let him take over
[51:49] and run us automatically
[51:51] not just automatic what I mean I think
[51:54] this I got every bit of that when I
[51:56] saved I've just automated it just
[51:58] automatic no the Prophet said he'd be
[52:04] automatically added one through the
[52:07] opening of the word through the opening
[52:12] the word will automatically add his
[52:15] nature and see that's where the things
[52:19] like I said this reason all of that is a
[52:21] back of a part to just get to one little
[52:24] thing read around on what is virtue we
[52:29] need virtues how do we get virtue
[52:37] we get it by the growth development of
[52:39] God's Word as he reveals himself to us
[52:42] it brings us virtue because what is
[52:46] virtue
[52:47] now why would ruther Branham say in the
[52:51] statute of perfect man explaining virtue
[52:54] and his first statement was he said now
[52:57] it is not to live a virgin life he said
[53:03] like a man or a woman well that would
[53:08] have been one of the first things I went
[53:10] to wouldn't you but you know what we
[53:12] wouldn't a prophet and that gets the
[53:15] wrong idea you think it's something you
[53:17] could do or not do right come on church
[53:23] did you read those things how about it
[53:33] is not to be let me get over here to it
[53:47] page 141 a paragraph 141 attached to a
[53:51] perfect man 143 coming through now right
[53:54] there knocks a lot of us at virtue to
[53:57] your faith that doesn't just mean living
[54:02] a virgin life because we look up the
[54:07] word virtue and it goes to that and
[54:10] that's what we think it is look what he
[54:12] says you know like a woman or a man or
[54:14] so forth that doesn't have nothing to do
[54:18] with that what about a man making that
[54:21] statement then he goes on to describe
[54:24] virtue as what strength strength because
[54:28] Jesus had virtue
[54:32] now was he against living a virgin life
[54:35] no no no come on he was expressing that
[54:40] that wouldn't what it was because that's
[54:42] what we think it is we think it's just
[54:48] living a good virgin life well you can
[54:51] do a virtue Verte virgin life and not be
[54:54] virtuous at all there's plenty of women
[55:02] in this world that are virgins and mean
[55:05] is a rattlesnake now you tell me that
[55:08] ain't true
[55:13] there are virtuous in the point I mean
[55:20] not virtuous to the point of it being
[55:23] virtuous they're virgin to the point of
[55:26] just being natural virgin they don't
[55:27] want to do it but virtuous to be a
[55:35] virtuous Christian
[55:40] now there's no way you can have virtue
[55:42] unless God supplies it it's not
[55:47] something you can try to develop do or
[55:51] exercise or do what that's when he's
[55:54] saying it it's not to be a virgin it's
[55:57] not something you can do is something he
[56:00] has to do all right so he comes into us
[56:04] to make us a virtuous Christian now that
[56:09] word is correct it's in the stature of a
[56:12] perfect man that to be a virtuous
[56:15] Christian like I said you me a virgin be
[56:20] mean it's routs night but even you can
[56:24] be a virtuous Christian that's what God
[56:27] wants is someone who has his nature in
[56:32] his ways into us and it's not how good
[56:36] we are that's what we think it is we
[56:41] think it's how good we are is what the
[56:43] statue of perfect man no it's not it's
[56:45] how much word that has been given unto
[56:47] us because only by the revealing of the
[56:52] word can you be a virtuous Christian
[56:57] it's wonderful and good to be a virgin
[57:00] that's true but you can be mean and be a
[57:02] virgin you get it so he said it's not
[57:07] that away he said it's not just being a
[57:11] virgin so then the virtuous must mean
[57:18] something that's what he said what did
[57:19] it he said it means power or strength
[57:22] and see do you remember Jesus and he
[57:24] refers to it and Luke where the woman
[57:29] touched him and he said virtue has won
[57:31] out virtue has won out
[57:38] strength God strength virtue
[57:46] Lorenz said you got to have it and got
[57:48] to have a pice for it to go out through
[57:50] let's see that's your virtuous life
[57:55] that's the part that we do have to
[57:57] affect to doing with is the virtuous
[58:00] part of our lives that we live right he
[58:03] said it's not much virtue to be able to
[58:04] draw from you he said if you see you out
[58:06] here you know going to church doing good
[58:08] and then the next day out in the world
[58:10] in sin there's no virtue to that but
[58:15] it's not now listen to what I'm saying
[58:17] and don't get miss understanding it's
[58:21] not how strong you are it's not that
[58:26] that's not the virtuous party's talking
[58:28] about see Jesus was Almighty God and
[58:35] people touched him and he said virtue
[58:38] strength his body was drained brother
[58:41] Brennan would talk about it he talked
[58:43] about how praying for people you know
[58:46] hour after hour and he'd be so weak he
[58:52] couldn't stand that strength going out
[58:55] but remember you can also run a marathon
[59:00] you can run a race and get tired so it's
[59:05] not that form of strength don't get that
[59:09] line it's not to just say form of
[59:12] strength to the body no it's not that
[59:15] it's virtue going out from you to
[59:18] another person have you ever experienced
[59:24] if you've never experienced it to be
[59:26] hard to explain but I have prayed for
[59:29] people when it just the whole strength
[59:32] of your body is gone but then I prayed
[59:36] many a prayer that I never felt a thing
[59:38] I don't mind telling you the truth both
[59:41] ways but I've seen it strain the body to
[59:47] work that you'd just be so weak at this
[59:49] you couldn't even walk
[59:53] but yet I've run a race and do that so
[59:57] don't get too too fit to you know mixed
[1:00:00] up don't get the physical park get the
[1:00:04] spiritual part it's drawing from you the
[1:00:13] x-rays you know how they've done it to
[1:00:15] make them stop doing it because the
[1:00:17] x-rays would pull from one person to
[1:00:19] another one rays and going through your
[1:00:21] body you know what I'm talking about
[1:00:23] they used to have me stepped on him he
[1:00:25] had you feet you could look at them and
[1:00:27] in the hands you can lay them out under
[1:00:29] it and it would just show all of that
[1:00:31] well they made him quit what because it
[1:00:35] wasn't safe it was doing the wrong time
[1:00:38] but science proves that race goes from
[1:00:41] one person to another that's the kind of
[1:00:45] strength I'm talking about that's the
[1:00:47] kind of virtue I'm talking about if
[1:00:52] something in God that he gives to you
[1:00:57] it gives it to you because he had it but
[1:01:05] remember how he had the virtue he
[1:01:09] couldn't live like the devil and claim
[1:01:11] to be the Messiah right am i right you
[1:01:17] wouldn't him this you know his mouths
[1:01:19] running and said I'm the Messiah he
[1:01:22] lived the life of the Messiah and it
[1:01:26] went out to it you know yourself what
[1:01:28] I'm talking about
[1:01:29] that there's people that you like for to
[1:01:31] pray for you right there's people you
[1:01:36] like to pray you get them to pray for
[1:01:39] you because you can feel more of those
[1:01:45] things
[1:01:45] all right see because it's it's part of
[1:01:50] something you've got a confidence in
[1:01:51] that person for some reason has built a
[1:01:55] confidence around you or your thinking
[1:01:57] and you can draw from it and that's
[1:02:00] strength
[1:02:04] so virtue is not just being a virgin
[1:02:05] life that way it's a virtuous life it's
[1:02:11] a Christian life lived in God by him
[1:02:14] living it through you and that way other
[1:02:18] people can see Christ and and want to be
[1:02:21] like you right they want to be like you
[1:02:26] they want to live like you and actions
[1:02:28] like you what if they don't see Christ
[1:02:34] in us I've told you about it had a lady
[1:02:38] at work one time I had to work with
[1:02:39] these two women right real close all day
[1:02:41] long and day in and day out cuz of the
[1:02:43] jobs that we were running and one of
[1:02:46] them got upset one day and said
[1:02:48] something I said oh that's all right we
[1:02:50] all get upset you know like that I said
[1:02:53] don't worry about it we all get upset
[1:02:56] she said Sam said I've been around you
[1:02:59] for I forgot how many years and I've
[1:03:00] worked side-by-side he said I've never
[1:03:02] seen you under pressure they're all
[1:03:09] messed up did you always just calm and
[1:03:13] collective envy it well you know that's
[1:03:16] a good way to be that's what we should
[1:03:20] be man it worked on her ass Tom asked
[1:03:25] him one time
[1:03:26] you heard him tell about it he said on a
[1:03:30] scale from one to ten said what do you
[1:03:32] think of Sam Dale he said I think that
[1:03:36] 11 would be a start could you see we had
[1:03:40] been friends all of our life I mean all
[1:03:43] the time we'd work together you've heard
[1:03:47] me tell her what it was done because
[1:03:48] it's true I don't we had a big old
[1:03:52] Destin table of he and I work from but
[1:03:55] the Colleen owes him Luther back I'll
[1:03:58] never remember it but you know what was
[1:04:02] so funny the way he and I set burn
[1:04:07] talked and done you know what he had on
[1:04:09] one the end of that desk and all the
[1:04:11] Playboy magazines just racks of him
[1:04:15] you know what I had on the other end my
[1:04:18] Bible and spoken word boots not there
[1:04:24] side by side everybody died life and
[1:04:26] said we can't understand it started to
[1:04:27] preach her own one in Playboy other than
[1:04:29] when I didn't go I walk over and look
[1:04:32] all I wanted to find a problem but it
[1:04:36] wasn't nothing to me
[1:04:37] and I he he come to my defense because I
[1:04:43] was sitting in the office that he had
[1:04:45] brought me a magazine there on the
[1:04:48] pyramids the Playboy magazine had a
[1:04:53] pyramid on the front I always got to cap
[1:04:55] it telling a lot about the pyramids of
[1:04:58] Egypt because I was studying on them and
[1:05:00] this man comes up and looked over enough
[1:05:03] isn't a little cubicle office oh we
[1:05:05] caught the preacher he's looking at the
[1:05:07] Playboy magazine he's over here novice
[1:05:09] come on boys and this was a white guy
[1:05:13] and that black guy he just reached and
[1:05:16] got him he slammed him up against that
[1:05:19] office and he said you leave him alone
[1:05:23] he said I brought him the magazines that
[1:05:26] he's studying to preach from it the boy
[1:05:29] nobody never said another word nobody
[1:05:34] didn't argue about what was going on and
[1:05:37] I brought the magazine here and read
[1:05:38] from it why why can't we be the same all
[1:05:43] the time and I we're human we make
[1:05:45] mistakes we're all got our blow ups and
[1:05:48] outs and ends and how we're human beings
[1:05:50] we'll get to that when we get on over a
[1:05:53] little bit more to temperance what bless
[1:05:57] God I don't how no bad temper well what
[1:06:01] do you need temperance for if you don't
[1:06:02] have a bad temper all right let's see
[1:06:06] virtue the point of trying to get across
[1:06:09] to you what is virtue he's not to just
[1:06:12] live a virgin life that's that's fine
[1:06:14] that's well and good that's not the
[1:06:17] definition of the statue of a perfect
[1:06:20] man of growth development in
[1:06:22] Christianity through the Word of God to
[1:06:25] bring us to a place to understand virtue
[1:06:27] means
[1:06:28] the life of Christ right
[1:06:33] he had virtue and it went out from
[1:06:39] people saw him he didn't have to get up
[1:06:42] every day as we always say he not to get
[1:06:45] up every day you know and so I got an
[1:06:46] act like God so I guess I'm gonna be God
[1:06:48] I better act like him today no he went
[1:06:52] about his daily duties as a Christian
[1:06:56] that was his virtues was his life that's
[1:07:05] why that our lives are so valuable to
[1:07:09] the basis you know of being right and
[1:07:12] doing right we're human
[1:07:15] come on but that's no justification but
[1:07:20] it's the truth it's a truth that were to
[1:07:26] be virtuous or at least be to the point
[1:07:30] to where people can pull from us right
[1:07:37] now may I back up a little bit to the
[1:07:40] last message I preached on the fivefold
[1:07:41] ministry for a second to just say what
[1:07:45] the Prophet had to say about it brother
[1:07:50] Branham said if you won't take God's
[1:07:53] Word like I'm laying here if you want if
[1:07:57] you won't take God's Word he said he
[1:08:01] just sends you a fivefold ministry
[1:08:04] remember that in the other day if you
[1:08:08] won't take God's Word he said he just
[1:08:10] sends you a file full ministry you need
[1:08:14] it hey come on I tell ya I'm gonna tell
[1:08:17] you I got something you you better bank
[1:08:19] on the fact that I got it blind
[1:08:24] Bartimaeus and his word should be
[1:08:27] sufficient if you didn't believe my word
[1:08:32] I'd probably just let it go if I didn't
[1:08:37] believe yours you'd let me go with not
[1:08:40] God if you don't believe
[1:08:42] his word was then still he sends the
[1:08:48] holy spirit with gifts in the church
[1:08:57] what's the first apostles prophets
[1:09:01] evangelists teachers pastors all for the
[1:09:05] perfect in the church to bring the
[1:09:07] church to the knowledge of him about it
[1:09:14] as the eagle stirreth his nest God is a
[1:09:19] good he sends his word and I hope you
[1:09:25] listening
[1:09:26] he sends his word he has sent us his
[1:09:30] word right the Prophet brought the word
[1:09:36] alrighty you with me he sends his word
[1:09:40] if you won't believe his word then he
[1:09:43] puts in the church five different
[1:09:45] offices first apostles prophets teachers
[1:09:49] pastors event they are for the
[1:09:51] perfecting of the church what about it
[1:09:57] he sent his word you don't believe his
[1:10:03] word he sent a fivefold ministry
[1:10:04] remember the message now I hope it was
[1:10:08] proof enough for you to understand that
[1:10:10] the fivefold ministry is predestinated I
[1:10:15] went through that over and over and over
[1:10:18] if you didn't get that tape go back to
[1:10:20] it remember you'll have to go back to it
[1:10:23] on the the fact of it being on the yeah
[1:10:27] or you call it
[1:10:29] it ain't video it's audio because the
[1:10:32] power went off but its own are now cuz I
[1:10:36] listened to it today so you know don't
[1:10:38] say well it ain't honor out of it now
[1:10:40] it's on her that message is on that her
[1:10:43] there was just a couple little clips
[1:10:45] they brought up the thing we taped it
[1:10:48] and everything but remember the fivefold
[1:10:50] ministry is for the perfecting of the
[1:10:52] Saints but now do we believe that
[1:11:01] now that was what the whole point of me
[1:11:04] re-emphasize Innova to begin with to try
[1:11:07] to get you to think about what is the
[1:11:10] statue of a perfect man what is the
[1:11:13] message of adoption to become partakers
[1:11:16] of his divine nature that we can live a
[1:11:20] Christian life and God can draw from
[1:11:24] that that strength can go out from you
[1:11:27] to others right Christian strength can
[1:11:34] go out from you there's a lot of people
[1:11:36] looking at you a lot of people looking
[1:11:41] at me and a lot of people trying to see
[1:11:44] each one of us and see what we are
[1:11:46] oh yeah we're human failures that's
[1:11:48] that's right but we're trying to be a
[1:11:53] Christian and walk in Christ that should
[1:11:58] be our desire and our thoughts for
[1:12:00] everything so it's not a virgin life
[1:12:04] that's not enough that's natural things
[1:12:07] that's something you could do or not do
[1:12:10] but a virtuous life is something you
[1:12:13] can't do it's a life in Christ the
[1:12:19] statue of a perfect man those disciples
[1:12:21] had virtue that virtue is a Christian
[1:12:24] life lived by the Word of God right it's
[1:12:33] the word lived by people you know people
[1:12:36] are looking at you trying to find Christ
[1:12:40] right I know I'll get up I get people
[1:12:47] upset at me because I go too far but is
[1:12:52] it true that maybe the reason your
[1:12:55] family doesn't want this word is because
[1:12:58] of the presentation that you made of
[1:13:02] this word
[1:13:09] that hurts don't it that drives a nail
[1:13:15] into all of our hearts
[1:13:19] maybe the reason your family is not in
[1:13:22] this message you might be you and your
[1:13:24] presentation of the message now see
[1:13:28] that's not virtue or virtuous oh you can
[1:13:32] be pure and holy and quiet I mean like a
[1:13:34] lily a beautiful and everything but what
[1:13:38] if we don't have a virtuous life to
[1:13:40] present to the world for them to be able
[1:13:43] to see Jesus Christ what about it
[1:13:54] have you ever really just apologized to
[1:13:57] your family ever apologize to your
[1:14:04] family we're going at it in the wrong
[1:14:07] way to try to win them to the Lord know
[1:14:08] bless God I was trying to win them to
[1:14:10] the Lord and I'm gonna stay with that
[1:14:13] okay what if that don't work what if the
[1:14:20] virtuous life is to live the life before
[1:14:23] them as an example and living that life
[1:14:26] as an example could win the people more
[1:14:32] than all of our great shoutings about
[1:14:35] what we've got
[1:14:42] when you shouldn't talk like that we're
[1:14:45] doing pretty good you got down meddling
[1:14:48] well alright but is it true is it true
[1:14:55] that maybe our families have not seen
[1:15:01] Christ in the way they should see him
[1:15:06] yes but brother Dale you can talk
[1:15:09] because all of your families in the
[1:15:10] message will I just made the point you
[1:15:13] killed your own self just now I didn't
[1:15:16] know it
[1:15:24] come on
[1:15:28] are you trying to break know how to
[1:15:30] break it still true what is the people
[1:15:37] around you think about you oh yeah
[1:15:41] they're all they got all of that videos
[1:15:43] oh that's just a bunch of fanatics being
[1:15:49] fanatical is one thing but being a
[1:15:51] Christian is another man there's a
[1:15:54] difference in fanatical and Christian
[1:15:56] you live a Christian life every day and
[1:15:58] they don't think you're fanatic but if
[1:16:00] you live in a Christian life and and
[1:16:02] they think in your fanatic you ain't
[1:16:04] gonna do it but when you make them think
[1:16:07] that of you we all have a problem yeah
[1:16:15] we all have troubles we all never days
[1:16:18] and ins and outs and up and down nobody
[1:16:20] said a word but we don't have to put
[1:16:24] that out there as the wrong thing to try
[1:16:27] to justify ourselves we just are what we
[1:16:30] are a virtuous Christian one who walks
[1:16:38] in God's Word did the disciples have any
[1:16:44] better days than we have that's my point
[1:16:46] of starting with in other words did they
[1:16:48] have real good days in real good huh no
[1:16:51] huh
[1:16:53] they were beaten imprisoned and malt and
[1:16:57] made fun of and all kind of things every
[1:17:00] day of their lives
[1:17:01] but as I asked you I wonder what they'd
[1:17:04] like to swap with us because here see
[1:17:08] we're facing all of these demons two
[1:17:11] hundred thousand thousand loosed on the
[1:17:14] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:16] somewhere there about in the 80s or
[1:17:18] something because that's where your
[1:17:19] prophet said he's 60 something he said
[1:17:22] 20 years later loosed on the bride
[1:17:28] but you know what it's far are we taking
[1:17:32] it as a Christian and being like Christ
[1:17:33] and saying whatever it takes you know
[1:17:36] what those demons are loosed on you and
[1:17:38] me far to drive us to the mess
[1:17:42] that's what's your profits then well why
[1:17:47] don't we take our down-and-outs as our
[1:17:49] joyously the fact of look what it's done
[1:17:51] it's drove us to the word then we might
[1:17:58] think about what I've tried to express
[1:18:00] the start with what is it to be a
[1:18:02] Christian what is it to be a statue of
[1:18:04] perfect man Christian
[1:18:16] well it's people that don't ever have no
[1:18:18] troubles will you miss Christianity by a
[1:18:20] longshot
[1:18:23] because according to my understanding
[1:18:26] they many of the afflictions of the
[1:18:28] righteous but the Lord lead us out of
[1:18:30] them all for my understanding to be a
[1:18:32] Christian is not going to set you aside
[1:18:35] to the place that you don't have no
[1:18:36] trouble it's gonna put you to place
[1:18:38] you're gonna have plenty of trouble
[1:18:40] right being a Christian is not an easy
[1:18:44] walk you know what I'm talking about
[1:18:50] it's a daily duty to be in a Christian
[1:18:55] but we walk in Christ what a wonderful
[1:18:58] thing then to be to realize he's paid to
[1:19:01] procced he's done all the other and all
[1:19:03] we got to do is do what he says and be
[1:19:08] automatically he didn't get up acting
[1:19:11] like Christ he was Christ he went about
[1:19:15] his daily duties being what he was
[1:19:18] that's what we're supposed to be be a
[1:19:21] Christian no matter where we're at and
[1:19:23] what we're doing you think about
[1:19:27] Christianity as a growth development of
[1:19:30] the Word of God as it's being revealed
[1:19:33] to us we started this journey with the
[1:19:38] Prophet in what we were talking about
[1:19:40] other statute of Purim and where he was
[1:19:42] saying over and over well how faith and
[1:19:44] be born again and then these are the
[1:19:48] things that he expects us to add add
[1:19:55] virtue well how can you add virtue
[1:20:01] do you realize what I've tried to say
[1:20:04] over and over if you believe it do you
[1:20:07] believe that brother Branham said this
[1:20:11] messenger of Malachi 4 will do two
[1:20:13] things turn the hearts of the children
[1:20:14] back to favor and open the thunders the
[1:20:17] do you believe that with you know what
[1:20:20] God has made away he didn't leave us
[1:20:26] without a way he's made a way for us to
[1:20:29] be able to receive what he's given us so
[1:20:39] that is not something we cannot attain
[1:20:41] Andrew well I'll change that we can't
[1:20:46] attain unto it I'll go the other way
[1:20:48] with I'll go with you on it cuz I know
[1:20:50] we can't attain unto a Christian life no
[1:20:53] but we can get in the way and hinder
[1:20:56] God's keeping him from getting it right
[1:20:58] in their own lives to be a Christian is
[1:21:06] to be christ-like living for others like
[1:21:13] a brother was preaching Sunday see
[1:21:16] living for others being for others a man
[1:21:19] there in the scripture you know what his
[1:21:21] name was wonderful because he he was his
[1:21:27] name feared what he was what about ours
[1:21:31] come on musicians what about it I'm just
[1:21:35] trying to get one point across because
[1:21:37] as we try to get this of the virtues you
[1:21:40] can't just read the virtue and say well
[1:21:42] we just read this and we know what it is
[1:21:44] no no no you're gonna have to read the
[1:21:48] virtues and let God show you what it is
[1:21:56] virtue is strength not physical strength
[1:22:03] but something that God has given unto
[1:22:06] you that others can see Christ and want
[1:22:11] to be locking right
[1:22:16] you remember when you first started to
[1:22:19] school come on
[1:22:24] every little boy in year the first day
[1:22:26] in school his school teacher was his
[1:22:29] girlfriend and I had one that when I
[1:22:33] finished the ninth grade she was still
[1:22:35] teaching so she is my 80
[1:22:37] something-year-old girlfriend you know
[1:22:41] what I'm getting at you know what I'm
[1:22:43] saying they set something in front of
[1:22:46] you as a way or a point and establish in
[1:22:51] to you the right thoughts in the right
[1:22:55] way of being and that's where Christian
[1:22:57] is Christian you say well the Christian
[1:23:01] is a sinless now Christian is not a
[1:23:03] sinless person Christian is a forgiving
[1:23:08] person but he doesn't use his sin as a
[1:23:12] crutch he doesn't use it as a crutch to
[1:23:17] to or to condemn others or whatever he
[1:23:21] just walks as to what he's supposed to
[1:23:23] be that's what these children are
[1:23:25] looking at they're seeing you and
[1:23:28] watching you and me we we live in our
[1:23:31] lives before the people if they want to
[1:23:34] be like you we're coming around the road
[1:23:40] over the house one day
[1:23:41] Tarrance we'd been over to see something
[1:23:45] our neighbor and he said daddy he said
[1:23:49] I'm glad you didn't follow her after
[1:23:52] that feller
[1:23:53] so that feller was a long higher down to
[1:23:56] here you know and he pita and I said
[1:23:59] what do you mean he said well I'm just
[1:24:02] glad you didn't act like that and look
[1:24:05] like that I I said why he said with cold
[1:24:08] I might have wanted to look that way I
[1:24:09] said I don't like that so that's a good
[1:24:13] point you know maybe we need to be more
[1:24:16] different let Stan just trying to make a
[1:24:21] point because how could you preach about
[1:24:23] virtue you can only live it
[1:24:28] you can't preach it that will be the
[1:24:32] whole goal now of all of these knowledge
[1:24:36] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:24:38] kindness to see is my love part of life
[1:24:56] right go ahead brother

[1:27:09] with him yesterday about we've got a
[1:27:12] physical problem so just remember that
[1:27:15] okay father we thank you
[1:27:19] we asked you to just go now with these

[1:28:09] that's what I mean that it's
[1:28:11] automatically yeah we just let go and
[1:28:14] let him live in the Christian life since
[1:28:22] to let Christ live in us that's
[1:28:26] Christian life not something I can do
[1:28:30] that's why I believe was that's what
[1:28:33] struck me when I years ago when I first
[1:28:35] read it it was so odd for brother Adam
[1:28:38] to be going declare virtue and what it
[1:28:41] isn't he said that's not to be a virgin
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:48] now I need to read a little bit more
[1:28:51] what he's saying because he just told me
[1:28:54] if not what I thought it was because I
[1:28:57] could look up the word
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:02] it's not looking at words it's a profit
[1:29:06] defining what a word means a virtuous
[1:29:12] life take on these things as weak or
[1:29:15] separately father we know tonight's been
[1:29:19] dried
[1:29:21] but yet it's meant for one time for us
[1:29:25] to see where we stand and what we need
[1:29:30] we don't need to try to manufacture
[1:29:33] something
[1:29:36] all we need to do is just let go and let
[1:29:39] you lens let you manifest yourself
[1:29:42] through us Lord and it's your virtue
[1:29:47] it's not mine anyways so just help us as
[1:29:53] we think about these things that we
[1:29:57] think about a growth development of in
[1:29:59] your word because that's what brains of
[1:30:01] your virtues to us is your word that's
[1:30:05] unveil to us we love in we thank you
[1:30:09] we were the people on the way home give
[1:30:11] everybody a safe journey let your loving
[1:30:13] grace be with us in Jesus name you just
[1:30:17] need
