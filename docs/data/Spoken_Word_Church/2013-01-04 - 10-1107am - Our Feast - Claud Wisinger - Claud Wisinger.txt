Corinthians the 4th chapter man everyone okay therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not butc hand the word of God manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the but if our gospel be head it is head to them that are lost in whom the God of this world blinded the minds of them which believe not that's the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servant for Jesus sake for God who commanded light to shine of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubl on every side yet not distress we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for Christ's sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death work in Us in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall rais up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sake that the abundance of Grace might through the Thanksgiving of many abound rebound to the glory of God for which cause we F not outward men perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen

Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Hool holy holy holy holy holy I to amen that's true isn't it Lord bless each and every one of you uh it's good to be back here they wanted me to come I think last April and preach one of the fellowship meetings and I just couldn't come Hallelujah had a lot of things happen at the Bartlesville Tabernacle a lot of deaths in the church it's just a trying time we're in it's what it is am but you know he in all the Journey of the children of Israel he never left them alone so we understand that he will never ever ever forsake us that's right you know that word forsaken if you really look at it it means left behind and I've told the church they made billions of dollars off this book left behind mind and I said I don't care to read it it has nothing to do with me whatever because he said he would never leave me he'll never leave me behind so I don't my mind my heart I don't even think that way because I know I've been born again and once you have that Born Again experience you recognize who you are not just who he is but you recognize who you are and the part that you have in that so I really appreciate him and the Revelation that he's given this end time he has just give us part word he hasn't just given me justification you know he's given me the mystery of God should be finished right in the day of the voice of the seventh angel I tell our church and I remind them a lot I say if a preacher comes in the pulpit and preaches a mystery you run from him yeah because my Bible says in 10:7 the mystery of God should be finished and I will declare to you that the mystery of God is finished in this hour so if a man come and preach you a mystery or a doct that you can't find in the message of the hour run for your life get away from him you understand because I will tell you he is he is the Satan that has transformed himself into an angel of Light is what he is so what I want to minister on today I preached a whole series on it I actually here when I was here the last time I was in the middle of this series and I was preaching on the history more of the history on the seven feasts and then I went home and finished that and then uh later on I got looking at it and instead of putting and brother R said you could put those seven feasts in the church agent I've got a quote I maybe you know the quotes brother but he said that you could put those seven feasts in the church ages right then I got looking at it and I thought it's not enough just to put them in the church ages you got to put them in the individual is that right because see what God is doing in this end time he's building a living Tabernacle for a living God is that right right that word living is now existent so let's put it like a now existent Tabernacle right of a now existant God so that's what it is today he actually exists in a bride people is what he does and it's tabernacling deity it's it's Jesus Christ in Bride form is that right that's what our Prophet said and that's exactly what it is so just want to let you know but I'm going to talk about our feasts and I'm going to hit some of them and the feasts that I really want to conent on today is the Feast of Tabernacles amen that is if if you want to zero in on a particular Feast that is the most important Feast that there is for us it is the seventh Feast Amen brother said the seventh seventh Church age right if you're going to put in the history of the church age then the seventh Feast is the Feast of Tabernacles is that right there's a lot of things that go on a lot of attributes of that that comes but it not only comes to the church ages but there's a people in those Church ages even when brother Brandon preached the stature of a perfect man you know I told the church you look at brother brandham what what it shows there here oh I like that I didn't know it was here see brotherly kindness right how many believe brother brandom had brotherly kindness I do you want me to I'm going to I going to say a quote to explain to you brotherly kindness hello Miss dog meat yeah yeah can I tell you that right did you know that was brotherly kindness yeah a lot of people don't think it is right but he said it did he not he said hello Miss dog me that was brotherly kindness so sometimes what you think brotherly kindness is and what brotherly kindness really is it's not this you falling all over somebody and shaking their hand say I love you brother and all that if you really love a brother you'll correct him you understand and if you got the spirit of Christ you'll take that correction is what you'll do so in the Statue of a perfect man brother brandham had to start explaining some of these things here to us is that right that's right and this right here I use a lot when I preach the feast days in a minute I'm going to show you why okay sorry to leave you standing I'm I'm not like brother ju forny where your helicopters up me helicopters down I tell people our church I'm like a C130 Transport I'm big and I go and finally I hit the end of the rail the the runway I'm up in the air and I come down a little slow too so you bear with me here cuz I preach this in 15 sermons and I'm going to put it into one you understand that's what I'm going to try to do I did it the other day and it took me an hour and 20 minutes I hope to shorten it up brother Wade told me if I take longer then it means I got less time downstairs to relax and I got to come back at two so if I keep you longer I'm not hurting you I'm hurting me okay so my goal is to get out of here as quick as I can to get downstairs okay so let's go to the scripture second Timothy 3:16 amen all scripture is given by inspiration of God it is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness where you the man of God right where you can have stand righteous before God right that the man of God may be perfect complete right right thoroughly thly and thly means all the way I want to say thly is soul Spirit body you understand we don't have something that just deals with the soul we don't have something that just deals with the spirit we don't have something that just deals with the flesh this is throughly it's all the way through do you understand this absolutely deals with the total man where we're at the stature of a perfect man that's what we got to come to right we really do truly furnished unto all good works okay now I want to read let's go to Leviticus 23 and 1 you know what it says God in Hebrews 1 God in sunry times spake and and where it says spake by the prophets brother random corrected that did you know that he said it wasn't spake by the prophets it spake in the prophets amen little different isn't it exactly so you can run your head all you want to me but until you live it you don't believe it can I just be honest with you that's the way it is and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the feasts of the Lord now these are not the Feast of Israel does everybody understand that a lot of people misunderstood they say well those were the feasts of Israel and they leave them back there no no these were the feasts of God these are the feasts of the Lord and if God want establish is something it's Eternal does everybody understand that God don't change his mind about his word right so I want to establish it's a feast of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim you know what Proclaim means preach amen which ye shall preach is that right right to be holy convocations convocations is a holy gathery right is that right even these are my feasts he stresses it to you right these are his feasts they're not your feasts you understand but you're a part of it because you know what in the end times she is him amen right that's right am if it's an open book you know who I found in there I didn't just find Jesus Christ in there found me so now if they're his Feast they're my Feast you understand because where your husband goes the wife goes too I hope ain't that the way it's supposed to work sure it is Glory let's see where are my six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest and holy convocation ye shall do no work therein not by works least any man should boast okay we know that it is the Sab of the Lord in all your dwellings every one of you do you understand that is this Len what he said a living Tabernacle of a living God in all your dwellings there's going to be a Sabbath on that seventh day does everybody understand you're going to enter into your rest is that right remember Naomi is that or Ruth when when he was doing the the kinsman redeemer she was resting is that right she entered into a rest is that right that's what we are what was in Revelation five open up the book of redemption is that right he's doing the kinsman redeemer work and you know what I'm just sitting in a chair resting it's not my Works least any man should boast there's nothing I can do it's all Grace it's what he done for me is that right so I thank God he's given me a revelation these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which ye shall Proclaim preach right in their seasons can I say this you supposed to be instant Inc seon and out of season is that what Paul said let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word Lord we pray that you'll help me to get myself out of the way oh Father may you come and minister to this people Lord Lord I appreciate the little Lula church here Lord Lord their Spirit-filled word living people even the ministers Lord they don't rule the people with fear or nickan ISM but they rule over them by feeding them the word what a great what a great PA thing a p p is and a gift to a local assembly I pray that you'll bless this people oh Father and Quicken your word to us today Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated amen like I say the last time I was here and uh preached uh I was in the middle of this at church so I really didn't bring this here uh but when I went home I was in the Atlanta airport and I was standing there and believe it or not there was a Jewish fell there and you know he had the the big hat on you know the black he had his prayer Shaw on he was there actually praying when I got there stood in the corner with his prayer book doing like that yeah and so I thought you know I'm going to take advantage of this guy right that's right so I went up there and I said uh can I talk to you for a minute he said well sure yeah you know of course you know we're dogs to them you understand that don't you so they're they're a little leery of us so anyway I asked him a few questions and I want to read I'd actually wrote it down I've got more notes up here so if I fumble around would you bear with me I tell our church don't get nervous God's not nervous is he that's right so I wrote it down here while I was at the airport and I just I I actually went back home to the church and preached on this subject and it and it it brings a very deep subject when you hear it I asked him this I said do you celebrate the Feast do you mean the festivals he said yes so a feast is a celebration does everybody understand that the feast is a celebration and this is what I teach our church in Daniel's 70 weeks brother said the anointing that'll be in the Millennium is Joy does everybody understand that see restore the joy of my salvation is what David had asked for and yet as message Believers we sat around the most long-faced people on the face of the earth now you tell me how you can do that if you've come right and you are celebrating when you come to church you're supposed to be celebrating you're supposed to have a joy in your heart I told our church if the anointing in the Millennium is going to be Joy brother Brown Say what you are here is what you're going to be there so if you don't start showing some Joy here amen you're not going to be there you understand what I'm saying you're not going to mess that up you know you may mess something up down here but you're not going to mess that Millennium up so if you don't have any Joy here what makes you think you'll be there so I told our church you better get some joy in your hearts what you better do is that right and I'm going to tell you when God brings a revelation to you it'll bring joy it'll bring the stimulation of Revelation you'll have joy in your heart you can't wait till the church do open cuz you're so full of the Holy Ghost you can't wait to hear the word of the Living God is that right so there's what we need to come to as a church as a bride can I say that okay amen next question as you know three of the feasts it is required you go to Jerusalem did you know that you got to go for the Feast of unleavened bread you got to go for the feast to Pentecost right so a Pentecostal experience is not an option come on brother is that right you're supposed to have a Pentecostal experience is what you're supposed to have is that what brother saying we don't believe in a Pentecostal organization or denomination well but we do believe in a Pentecostal experience is that right right sure it's required you be there it's required you come to the Feast of unleavened bread what is leavening it's a type of of the the doctrine of the scribes and the Pharisees you got to come to unleavened bread which means you got all that cooked out of you did not brother B say you burn that you can't bring that over into this then you have to burn some of those Baptist ideologies that you picked up sure you did because this is unleavened where we're at folks there's no leaving in it whatsoever is that right okay so unleavened the the Feast of unleaving you had to be there feast of Pentecost you had to be there the third Feast that was a requirement y every male every male had to go there the Feast of Tabernacles so I'm going to tell you the Holy Ghost is not an option it is not an option in the day okay it is a requirement all the males have to go there does everybody understand so there was three of them you were required to be there do you know what Jesus's Ministry he walked up and down in those feast days exactly when he was there during those Feast he would actually preach that he was those feasts all the feasts were were a shadow of things to come just like the scripture says all scripture is given by inspiration those feast days spoke of Jesus Christ but you can't stop it there you can't put to Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago he is a now a living existing God tabernacled in a br so those seven feasts will be on this play in the end time in the bride amen Jesus Christ in Bride form come on brother is that right right it is I asked him that you know as you know three of the feasts is required you go to Jerusalem do you right no the rabbis changed that since the temple was destroyed oh my they got no Tabernacle you understand but I'm going to tell you I tell people in our church this Moses had a vision Y is that right of the Tabernacle right he got caught up he was on the mountain he seen the vision of the Tabernacle is that right right he come down and he told the people did Moses build it the people build it that's right and people in this message wonder about the tent Vision didn't Moses have a tent Vision who built it didn't Moses build it do you expect brother Brandon to come back and build that tent no he gave you the ision the prophecy of it you know the word testimony means prophecy a testimony is you take the prophecy of this hour and you live it if you don't put Flesh on it you don't believe it come on Amen so when it talks about in Hebrews 11 a testimony brother man said testimony is prophecy exactly what is it what you testify of the way you walk out there is your you are either fulfilling the Prophecy of the message of this hour or you're not one of the other and don't you say you got the holy ghost live a hound dog life you got the holy you got the god tabern KN in you you can't do those things you try to accuse God of that that's nonsense exactly amen bless if there's ever a time we need to clean up right is now now Glory am this thing's fixing to close out you understand that we need to get ready come on Amen thank you you do know the Messiah is coming to Israel he looked me right in the eyes and you know what he said Elijah amen see I forgot I received my Elijah I forgot they ain't looking for the Messiah come on they're looking for Elijah that's right I had a heart attack I almost had a screaming fist that's right that's the truth I said well sure he looked me right in the face and I said you know the Messiah he said I said are you looking for he said Elijah he didn't say any other word I stepped a couple of steps back I said well sure Glory I didn't disagree with that's what they got to get to Elijah right we understand that by the message of the hour that's right am that's right I asked him I said well what are you going to do he said I don't know come on and that kind of the way it was for us amen did we really know did we have a revelation tell Elijah got here no no that's right they don't either they're just as confused as they were out there 969 denominations you talk about confused right I worked one time with a Jewish man from Russia we were walking down a Runway at work cuz we went over to the cafeteria I looked at him I said Mike I got a question to ask you I just could you answer it I said do you believe that the Messiah is going to come out of Bethlehem he said well sure the scripture says that I said now now my next question is you just gave Bethlehem back to the PLO will he be Arab Oh my he looked at me and he said I never thought of that I said there ain't no Jews in the PLO they're Arabs right so what are they looking for they don't even understand the very scripture he's supposed to come out of Bethlehem they gave it to the PLO is that right so what are they thinking over there right right what are they going to make a league with right I told them the other day you know God started working on getting the Jews out of Europe back in Martin Luther's day Martin Luther said they were Antichrist did you know that right away God laid that right down there and I told him I said you know you had to take every dime from a Jew to get him moving right sure he'll hang on to a dollar bill you hand him a dollar bill he laying the floor with it he won't let it up ask a Jew how much money he's a GU he'll never tell you you talk about a man who loves a dollar bill they love a dollar bill right there right so what do you think that persecution why it was so hard why there were 6 million people because that's the only way they could get out of Europe right they controlled all the money of Europe go look at the history of it that was the tender hand of Jehovah to get them out of Europe because he's wanting to go back to the Jews and he can't do it as long as they got a hold of a dollar bill is't that right exactly I asked him I said what sector you in he said between hidic and Orthodox you know the Jews have more denominations than we do they have the liberal Jew the conservative Jew the hidic Jew the Orthodox Jew they're just as messed up right with denominations as we are is that right sure do you know where the ark is no I said do you know where the manora is he said yes I told him yeah the pope had it that Rascal and he said he conferred with me he shook his head cuz on the Arc of Triumph it shows the man manora where Titus took it into Rome is that right why you think they're in the middle of this thing that that last week at Daniel how do you think they're going to make a league with them they got to have that manora they want that manora does everybody understand that there's a lot of things that's in Rome they want and they're going to make a league to get it right exactly so I just wanted to show you this conversation I had but I I tried to sit around the feast I said what do you call God they said Hashim do you know a Jew in conversational language cannot say the word God right he can't say the word Jehovah y he can't say Elohim I asked him I said uh you don't call him Jehovah or Elohim he said only in prayer in general conversation we call him Hashim that is a name that they conjured up do you understand and then I got excited I said you know what I know the lovely name of God Jesus Christ that's right that's right you talk about Grace I understood Grace real good after that they don't even know the name of God yet is that right they're going to find it out in their atonement aren't they they're going to find find out that name of the Lord Jesus Christ the one that paid the price for Redemption what did Brother brand sit there waiting for when he preached the seven the the the Feast of the trumpets right he said they are waiting for their atonement right the part of their atonement is that lovely name do you understand what I'm saying they have not spoke that name and they'll think he's a a belly buub brother said they called Jesus Christ Bells above the lowest name you could give a human on earth oh my that's how lowly didn't he right amen something isn't it right I asked him about the Feast of trumpets he said it is our new year a lot of people don't understand there's a civil calendar there's a religious calendar and the Feast of trumpet starts the new year right does everybody understand that can I say this where you might understand it when I kind of just Breeze over them A New Beginning yeah right is that what a new year is even in America we have a New Year resolution where we say we're going to quit this we're going to quit that we're going to quit this we're going to be that so what is the feast of trumpets it's a new beginning we've had a trumpet sound in our day do everybody understand that you've had a trumpet to sound in your day and it's brought a new beginning to me amen a new life can I say it that way that's the purpose of the trumpets to bring new life is that right okay listen do you still believe Elijah will return at the time of the Passover yes we leave the door open for him do you know when William brandham was born the date that was the day of the Passover that year that he was born do you know that see those Jews aren't wrong those Jews are looking for Elijah during the day of the Passover do you know God so Honors that is that right that William Brandon was born that year he was born go look it up he was born on the Passover they're not wrong you see what I'm saying a lot of these things that the Jews believe is absolutely a fact amen so but our Prophet was born on the day of the Passover we got our Elijah does everybody understand that we got the fourth of Elijah didn't we they're going to get the fifth Spirit of Elijah over there is what they're going to get okay yes we leave the door open for him I hope you leave the door open for him what is the door the heart right you better leave it open for him don't you you want him to come in and commune with you amen I do I want this message of the hour to get into my heart it's what I want not the gray matter between my ears right I don't want the baptism of the Holy Ghost on my spirit realm I want to get it down in the inside of the inside where it will change this old claw into a new creation a new life can I say it that way where it's not me that lives any longer but it's Christ in me that lives that's what I want right right brother I asked him this I don't know if you guys and basically I was asking about several of Feasts I wanted was the first fruit wave sheath barley I don't know if you guys understand this and I'll explain it in a minute he said yes do you understand the difference in barley and wheat right barley has no leavening in it right Glory Jesus Christ had no sin in him can you do you understand that he was absolutely perfect now you're wheat right do you know wheat has some leav if you women you know you should know this you guys are cook unless you're like my wife we go out and eat most of the time now it's just me and her at home I'll come home there's no gravy or nothing smelling in the house I say what's for supper well we're going out tonight I don't know why I even asked her anymore I should just tell her let's load up right that's the way it is but barley barley the characteristic of barley is it has no leav whatsoever in it amen Jesus had no sin does everybody understand that cuz if he had sin if he had leaven in him how could he be My Sacrifice it took a perfect sacrifice is that right in order for me to be redeemed in order for me to be brought back so the barley is a type of Jesus Christ amen okay let me tell you something when and I'll get into that in a minute I'm get ahead so you and in wheat there was leaven in it that's me and you me and you right see this is the leav does everybody understand this is the leaven that I got got right here scripture Paul said to Wi the Redemption of the body right there's when the full Redemption takes place can I say it that way right the rest of me has been changed if you want the truth it has all I'm waiting for now is a body change that's all I'm waiting for cuz this thing right here's leav it was born and lust can I tell you that my mother conceived me in lust is what brought this forth any of your kids they came the same way they didn't come by a holy Veil they came by a lust Veil is that what he said no wonder he said the woman was the tree of death right amen bless was the two loaves wheat yes what did these represent he said barley is feed to the animals well you know I didn't I didn't go with that I knew what it was and he wasn't going to take it anyway weed is for man it shows transformation from animal to man which is true is didn't brother Ram say we had a transformation you know we everything I don't know about you brother and you guys I went down here yesterday in your Bible study they talking about sanctification every message I read is on a new birth now right transformation isn't that something that was changed if you're transform from AC to DC or DC to a is that a change right I every message I invisible Union exactly uh stature of a perfect man brother said you don't even get to start up this till you have the new B till you've been changed is that right right I told him last place I pre you know what the problem is we got a bunch of preachers ain't got the new birth pretty rough isn't it how can you preach strange you know if brother R said for a woman if you had the Holy Ghost cut your hair the Holy Ghost won't let you cut your hair you understand it sisters if you say you believe the message of the hour and you do things that this message says you shouldn't do oo go ahead is that right uh you better go check up so what you God just didn't send this message to tingle your ears right this message is to be lived it's to be a testimony this prophecy has to become a testimony in the people and if it don't become a testimony all you did is you heard God sent a prophet and you heard his message but you better get to the point where you're testifying testimony a live life of the prophecy right God wants Prophecy with flesh on it's what he wants can I just say it that way okay that was the end of the convers ation I had with him but I just wanted to give you a quick review on some of the things I thought you know that's what I've been teaching in the church so what I'm going to take you to now is the Passover and I'm just going to do it real quick and I'm going to really stick with Tabernacles here if I can the Feast of the Passover right right A lot of people don't understand you think and I I it's kind of I wondered about this myself the Passover it talks about every male had to be at the Feast of unleaving do you know the Feast of unleaving you know it was 7 days right the day after the Passover for seven days you got to have all your unle go read it though the day of the Passover they got the leav out of the house then they didn't wait till the day of unleaving you understand so the Passover when the blood was applied the first time you believe the message of the hour and you applied the blood over your doorpost right you had to get the leing out is that right do you know how they did it they would take a candle pretty good a't it Seven Candle golden candlesticks if you were in the age of Luther you'd take Luther's life and you went every room of your heart and You' have got the leav out is that right now we know Luther had a dip for his age he had part word can I tell you that he did but the people in Luther's day had to take the candle light of that age and in the heart they had to go and take they had to take a breadcrumb that was in a corner of a room and get it out you know what they did when they found leing you know what they did with it yeah they burn it right that's what I told you remember when you were in a Baptist and they got you all crazed up with Doctrine or wherever you come from all of us practically come from a denominational church somewhere so we had some leaven in us right so before the P you need to get start getting rid of that stuff you know you got to apply the blood over the doorpost the heart right you got to get all the leavening out is that right now it's a process it's going to be seven days I'm kind of like you you know you're not you may sit around here and smoke cigarettes for a while but if you truly scripture says if you truly are Justified you're going to be glorified if you come to true sanc or justification that true justification is going to take you to sanctification that true sanctification is going to take you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's going to bring you to the person of Jesus Christ tabernacling in you is what it is is that right that's what the message of the hour says so we see the Feast of Passover get the Le out to apply the blood do you know they took what they applied the blood with was hup you know grew everywhere and you say well they heal people down they have healings in the Baptist Church it grows everywhere folks is that what he said his up grows everywhere it's in the Baptist Church it's in the Lutheran Church brother said it's mine and your fault they didn't hear it right you know there's going to be people in Lutheran Church going to go through tribulation and I'm I believe they'll come up the white Throne judgment why because the blood is still applied is that right remember he applied seven blood 7,000 years the blood is still applied through the amen Millennium to the white Throne judgment is that right the blood is still there there was one brother I don't remember who you were now but he talked about sanctification how you had to be sanc and it's true Sanctified every day of your life do you know there was a blood offering gave for every one of the seven feasts so it means sanctification is ongoing you understand it don't matter where you're at in the feast you got to have the blood of life you have to have have sanctification is that right it's the truth and that's what it's showing every one of the feast days there was a blood sacrifice given right but in the Feast of Passover they would take his up they couldn't just take a piece of the hiss up plant they took the whole plant yeah that's the rule do you understand when you come to the true Passover and you get this message of the hour this faith that has been given in this day you can't take a piece of it you got to take the whole whole revelation of the hour and apply the blood to your door poost you understand so you this is not a cafeteria style you can't take part of this and leave part of it you got to take the whole message of the hour and apply the blood is what you do so there's an important part of the Feast of Passover right amen so the next day was the Feast of unleavened bread right okay what they did they took a piece of unleavened bread no leavening in it is that right you had to and it was wheat you understand that right you had to put water in it and I read it up how how how you had Coast your unleavened bread you had to before 17 minutes put that thing in the heat right right because if you put water in wheat and you leave it there it will start Rising on its own why cuz it's got in it okay now you understand what I'm saying but what they do they take that they' put it and cook it before they did it they take a fork and they put stripes on it right was he beat with stripes was he yes was he the unleavened bread yes there was no s you understand and then he put it in the oven is that right does everybody understand that's what the UNL bread is and then you had to partake of that exactly is that right you had to eat the unleavened bread every day there's been given remember it was seven days the unleavened bread every Church age there was unleavened bread given in the days of Luther justification was the unleavened bread of that dayly now he had some he smoked a pip and drank a beer so you know he didn't have it all I'm going to tell you that like I said he had part the part that God allocated the part that he gave in that age Luther stayed true to it is that right there was no leav in that justification we still believe justification today is that right we really do I believe the new birth justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's what it is so I still believe in it so for seven days seven Church ages there could be no Leen found right does everybody agree with that amen now we're going to go to the fruit first fruits and and I want to kind of back up and show you in order to start the feast the high priest would go out every day into the field Y and he would check the crop to see if that barley had green ears on it right now remember he said Jesus was a green tree right exactly old dry one like us right the old wheat can I put it that way but he' check for green ears cuz then the priest would say it's time to start the feast when he' seen that barley was ready right it was time to start the feast like I told the church what did Brother R say it's holding this whole thing up us the field the crops the wheat The Barley we're holding this thing up do you understand God ain't holding it up he's waiting on us brother we keep thinking we're waiting on God God's waiting on us is what it is amen is that right so he could declare the feast that the feast would start what they would do is they would take the out of the corner of the crop or wherever it was rip first they would take pull up some barley and then they would take it into the temple did you know that yeah and they would beat it with a rod do you know they beat that with a rod yeah to get one r y yeah is that right right then they wave that R over the rest of the crop exactly is that right amen is that what they did right they would wave it over there it was three and a half how many years was Jesus ministry right that was the fruit of his ministry wasn't it what did he wave over the crop three and A2 year Ministry did Brother Ram say in a rising of the sh Sun that the wave sheath has been waved again in our day what did he wave over 3 and 1/2 years of ministry down here now we have the seven the Messiah week you know how I believe Daniel 70 weeks I tell people I said you need to go read it again you need to understand what brother B was talking about you know people like I told him I said how are you going to know the whole purpose of Daniel's 70 weeks was to tell us we're at the end that's right how else would you if brother BR said Israel's our time piece how would I know it's truly the end time brother Bram had to preach Daniel 70 weeks to prove to me were at the end and without a shadow of a doubt we're at the end but you know there's a messiah week in there is that right and you know what I've received that Messiah week and like I told you I don't know if I preach I think I preached a parable here a parable has two parts it has a part he tells it and that's what he did when he was here but there's a mystery left on it that's right and this day the mystery of God is finished The Parables have come together I have taken at our church all 40 Parables and preached them out of the message of the hour there there is no mystery left in this is what I'm trying to tell you you understand so that that first fruits was that that came to fruition first was waved over the people that was Jesus Christ what do you think was waved over the people in the end time Jesus Christ people will say it's William brandom it's Jesus Christ it's the son of man that's been waved over you here in the end time you understand right it's a truth it was the son of man that was La over me and I'm going to be just like that is that right brother said she is him Glory boy I love that you know the more I say it the more I like it but you know when I first started saying my flesh would jump because remember there's that guy there's where that leav is right here but inside my heart and my spirit it says Amen to the word of God is that right I'll line right up to it this is the guy this is the black dog right here that brother BR was talking about if I feed that in there more than I feed this I win the white dog if I feed this guy this guy will win you understand that's why you better quit Fe and I'll tell you what I tell the church about neurotic I went one day I was going to preach a message on neurotic okay so I was going to preach it I went to all the psychological journals and looked up neurotic you know what they said about it it's no longer a valid analysis you know why everybody's in neotic didn't brother random say they were one in 63 they're one degree away from Insanity you know he explained what neurotic was is a guy that pulled around in going 92 mph to get home to set for an hour to wait on a meal that his wife was cooking and let me ask you so do we get caught up in the we if we're not careful I told the church we need to slow down right we get so fastpaced we don't read our Bible am I telling you the truth we don't read our Bible we don't read the books we don't get in the Tes we don't even pray enough why neurotic right you can get caught up in that this white dog will get caught up in that run here run there we do this do and I ask him why why do you have to do it ask yourself why right sometimes you know when Daniel Daniel it says they'd be running to and fro he prophesied of being neurotic is that right isn't that what brother R said neurotic was right they're running to and fro there's your definition of neurotic right right so I got on Feast of first FRS now I'm going to go to Feast of Pentecost Pentecost we know is a seven Church brother say it's the long Feast does everybody understand that it is the long Feast it's the church ages 2000 years is a feast of Pentecost can I tell you that seven time seven right there was seven sabbaths in it every Church age a message was preached the people come under that message and were laid to rest they had a Sabbath in it right every one of them it happened that way on the 50th the day after the Sabbath came a jubilee which is a shout right we know that a cry a shout went out right we understand that in the message of the hour so you had a jubilee now in the Jubilee here in the church age if you go look at Jubilee and brother Brandon when I studied it out brother Brandon would talk this Jubilee the same as this Jubilee but this golden jubilee is different than this Jubilee can I tell you that this Jubilee here was you could go free right right but you didn't get all your possessions back is that right right you could go free in the first church age under Paul but you didn't get your possession back but in the Jubilee the golden jubilee when that blew you got your possession back and every every child of Israel got their land back they were all equal on the day of Jubilee no wonder there's no great ones Among Us the Jubilee says there's no great ones Among Us does everybody understand that the Jubilee another rule of Jubilee just to explain it to you is do you know that God said the land is mine he never said the land is yours right the land is mine does everybody agree he said you can possess the land what did Brother say you're the he was Christ exactly see the land's not yours but you possess the land my theophany is in there folks you understand I tell people what happens to a lot of people they're looking for something to happen brother said one day one of those lights are going to come pick you up it has you know what that light that Lo has come down into me and has picked me up as what it is I'm not waiting for a Rapture I am the rapture is that right right so there's your 50 days your every day they put them to rest is that right then we come to a jubilee we're in that Jubilee time right now is that right so I can show you is the Passover still good today yes is the unleavened bread yes I don't have any leening in this message of the hour that's right like I say you get a preacher that brings some leing their own ideas you better run from that guy exctly is that right why because I'm feasting under the unleavened bread I'm in that Feast you understand I'm in the Feast of first fr fruits is that right he's Arisen in my heart exactly and then the Feast of Pentecost I guarantee you I've had a Pentecostal experience is that right then now what I want to show you those Fe the first three feasts are absolutely Jesus Christ okay the next one is the church ages right yeah I said that right right right the last three this was his first coming right the last three are his second coming right did it say the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a Sher exactly you know see people in the message said now remember the trumpets are to Israel and that's a true statement right but we understand the trumpets are the same as the seals all seven trumpets sounded under the six seal we understand those quotes but was brother r a trumpet sure he was a trumpet what he was Paul a trumpet yeah we've had as Gentiles we've celebrated seven trumpets too you understand what I'm saying but they want to put it over there they don't understand there is a feast of trumpets for the Gentiles it's the same as the the the seals are the same as what the trumpets were is that right I read an article one time I love this article okay it talked about trumpets it was talking anybody been in the Navy somebody is there somebody been in the Navy please tell me yes I haven't found nobody in the Navy yet I've preached in four or five churches and I can't find anybody that's been I guess nobody gets in the Navy anymore huh but you know in the Navy what they've got is an intercom system yeah and if it's Battle Stations it goes well what that was was a they took and put on an intercom the same trumpet that would have a trumpet go right so what they did they recorded it yeah and what they did so you'll know if you're supposed to get up in the morning if you're supposed to go rily go to bed at night if you're brother said in the Civil War they would they would blow the trumpets if they were going to stack them yeah is that right if they were to charge if they were going to retreat right is that right you know you're a trumpet to this congregation that's our responsibility is to trumpet to keep everybody in step and doing what they're supposed to be doing the trumpet right well so we had seven trumpets and those seven trumpets sounded is that right and that trumpet didn't give an uncertain sound to me because look that was my trumpet and I'm under that trumpet is that right if the trumpet says charge I charge if the trumpet says Retreat I Retreat whatever this message says I go do it does everybody understand that so in the Navy they have it and it's recorded So what they do is they sound the intercom for them to go to bed to go to lunch Battle Stations everything they do on a ship is buy a trumpet okay to know what they're supposed to do right but get this now and I want you to understand it's recorded can I tell you that these sounds are recorded but when the Admiral comes on board they don't use a recording they get a live trumpet is what they blow do you think you're going to be able to set it takes and hear reportings and make it that's right I'm going to tell you the Admiral's here today and he's got a live trumpet to say he's got a man that's going to give a certain sound do you understand what I'm saying there's a lot of people around the message of there they don't even understand what the trumpets are if they understood that they'd have a live Ministry in their church is that right because why the Admiral is aboard I am not going to tell you he's coming I'm going to tell you he's here that's what our Prophet said in that trumpet you'll have a light if you're under the Feast of trumpets you'll have a live trumpet cuz if the Admiral is here you will have a live trumpet you won't be listening to a bunch of recordings at home some preacher can't put his finger on your nose and tell you to quit doing that stuff you're not going to bring that into the congregation of the righteous I have never seen anybody that doesn't do recordings that their life is a mess can I tell you that right is it yep exactly it is they'll have heels that's they'll have nails you know brother said you trim the front of here yeah a little girl yeah you got to be kidding me yeah you know brother R told about these women who were 60 years old trying to be a little girl is that what we got around the message the grow up sister come on right amen you you see you need to grow up right right right sure you do so there's your Feast of trumpets right then we're going to talk about the day of a atonement you know the day of atonement was when they Afflicted their souls right do you go look at that word Afflicted they humbled themselves right did you know that y see if you're really if you're really under that day of atonement you're in that Feast you're going to humble yourself right I know he told me he said well he can't take a man who's arrogant well yeah because we're under the feet we're under the day of atonement this is the day of atonement do you understand what I'm saying right so what do you we don't like anybody that's arrogant you're going to Humble I told the church the more God reveals this message to me the humbler it makes me if you got a revelation it ain't going to give you now I got a big head I apologize it's the natural but I said if that preacher's got a big head and all puffed up he's got Le and now what L does it Puffs your old head up is what it does right that's what we got around the message of the hour we got a bunch of preachers all puffed up they don't they're not humble is that right but if you got the day of atonement you're going to afflict your soul you're going to be a humble humble man right now one thing about the day of atonement I really want to explain to you do you know the day of atonement there was only one priest in there one yeah one there wasn't brother random of Jesus Christ in there does everybody understand what I'm saying there was one he was the high priest exactly do you know he had 15 sacrifices he did that one day he did it alone you understand he did it alone in there Jesus Christ died died alone amen there was no disciple around him do you understand that on that day of atonement there was not one person there doing any work there was only one doing the work it was Jesus Christ and that's the big part of atonement that you need to understand that's why it'll humble you when you realize it's not by works least any man could boast that's right there's no Works in this you understand what I'm saying your works is an expression of your faith now I believe faith without works is dead so if you say you believe the message of hour and you don't bring forth works you are d e a d exactly is that what the scripture says it's the truth so the day of atonement is what he diden what he did right is that right Amen in Revelation 10 1-6 is that what brother brandham did could he open the book it was what he did does everybody understand it's what Christ did for me not what William brandham did and I love William brandom I want to shake his hand the other side if there's ever a man that gave himself up for a people it's him exactly he lived an example of a life did he not right I love him I really do but he's not he didn't make my atonement I'm not going to worship William brandom I'm going to worship Jesus Christ because he did it alone he died alone is that right that's exactly there's your day of atonement now we're going to come to the Feast of Tabernacles now A Feast of Tabernacles does anybody know when brother Brandon preached the stat of a perfect man you ever looked at the dates I knew I'd have you there you read the date hold on I got the book say don't get nervous I just got a bunch of notes the stature of a perfect man let me read the date it'll blow your mind you ever looked at the date of it did I tell you I can't keep anything secret you know brother Ram said he couldn't keep a secret didn't he I'm glad he could couldn't absolutely amen you can't keep a secret either can you I told him church I'm a big mouth I I can't keep a secret I'm going to be honest with you if God gives it to me I give it out that's what that Pastor is supposed to do you know a pastor lives amongst their people a pastor literally lives amongst the people is what he does he cries when you cry he hurts when you hurt right that's what the pastor is he's a man who lives amongst his people is what I tell the church okay amen sure October the 14th 1962 does anybody know when the Feast of Tabernacle starts yeah October the 15th the day after this message was preached right brother brandham was telling us and about the feast the Tabernacles does everybody agree with that right amen the statue of a perfect man was preached the day before the Feast of Tabernacles was to start amen so what did Brother Brandon preach the statue of a perfect man is the Feast of Tabernacles amen right it is the Feast of Tabernacles does everybody understand that so if you want to understand what the Feast of Tabernacles was go read the statue of a perfect man amen is that right look at his look at his title even as they call it statue of a perfect man but listen to what he said and this morning we want to speak on a subject or teach rather if we can building the living Tabernacle amen building the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the perfect man the living Tabernacle the now existent Tabernacle right of the Living God where he dwells so brother Brandon when he preached stature of a perfect man he was preaching under the Feast of Tabernacles does everybody understand that do you know brother brand in Feast of the trumpets he said we are now feasting under the Feast of Tabernacles does everybody know he said that you think he just said that to saying that no what was brother Brandon doing now he's going to bring somebody by the preaching of the Gospel right is that right he's going to bring a man the stature of a perfect man and you know what you can't even start here without being having a new birth right come on did Brother brand call it the divine nature go look at what he says here it's a divine nature is what it is is that right so God can't even start the growth until you get a new birth now a baby tell now it it grows so big in the mother's womb right is that right so you could be in the church out here you can have a spirit right you can have a body but you still areen a living Soul until you get the new birth you understand what I'm saying you do not there's something's got to die in you because your first birth was not right you were born under a lust Veil not a holy Veil Eve walked away from that Holy Veil if she have stayed behind the word that was the Holy is that right we' have come the right way we' have been spoken into existence by the spoken word is the original them but you know what I come by a lust Veil is what I did this is what you say in the ugly you know in the Feast of Tabernacles they were going it was on their Journey did you know that and you know we show them and I don't know if you got one here we show these n real fancy tents you see them nice looking tents when they do it they were booths right they were foursided booth that they'd fold up and take the rule of the Feast of Tabernacles it had to be a temporary Booth a temporary dwelling is that right it's a temporary dwelling this is a temporary dwelling I live in this is the tab Feast of Tabernacles you know the rule of that is that when I looked up I had to be able to see at least one star and I have I have seen his star and I have come to worship Him Do You Realize that's what it is the Three Wise Men followed a star I followed a star too is that right and even a day star has arisen in my heart the New Birth has happened with me you understand so now I can start a growth pattern up is that right and these things right here do you know brother there's one word in statute of a perfect man he used he never used anywhere else anybody know what the word is vulcanized you ever looked it up yeah you ever look you're an old guy you he's an old guy I'm an old guy there's some other old guys here too remember we as kids we had a bicycle time and you had to patch it right we didn't use this man-made glue stuff they got now this organizational stuff they got out there we didn't use it did we what you do you take a scraper and you'd have to scrape it see when you come to the New Birth it ain't going to be easy boys you're going to get some scraping you're going to get some things scraped off of you going to rough you up a little because he's going to put that that patch on you and that patch is the same material as a tire does everybody understand that so what he's going to do he's going he's going to scrape her down then he's going to put that patch on you and there's four little screws pressure right and he's going to pressure you down is that right he going to pressure you down now that ain't all of it now guess what he's going to do he's going to take a match right and he's going to put it right in the middle of that thing right in the middle of it I remember when I was a kid you didn't put it over on the edge you put it in the middle of that patch didn't you you break it open and when it did guess what the patch me and the tire became one does it not say in Ezekiel wherever the wheel and the wheel went I went with him exactly why because I was vulcanized to that do you realize the stature of a perfect man is when you and him are one you watch how many times after brother Brandon preached that message he started saying she is him why he use the word vulcanized okay right so what it is you're vulcanized to the wheel does everybody understand that in 1963 what come down the wheel and the will am who was in the middle of it Jesus Christ there were four living creatures it came through eternity is that right spinning from eternity is that where it came from and you know what you got vulcanized to That Glory you understand in 1960 you were vulcanized today that's what you were and now I can say she is him I can read this message of the hour and say she is him if she is him he's the word you're the word right right I count it not robbery to be equal with God is that what the scripture says so the whole entire Feast that we go through was nothing but just bringing you up bringing you up bringing you up did you know brother brandom said these right here Faith virtue knowledge Temperance that it took heat yep to set them in you right did you know he said it took heat is that right what are they this is character he's building right here brother say character is a victory God just don't give you character you got to win it's got a battle you got to go through okay you lose your temper big deal keep fighting the battle one day I guarantee you he'll Vulcan he'll put some heat on you and he'll vulcanize you to that will and when he vulcanize you to the will the temper will be gone you'll have Temperance it'll be holy Temperance he wasn't talking about natural Temperance here he's talking about a holy Temperance is that right Temperance where you won't R back right is that what Jesus did he had Temperance he didn't RW back he had no G found in his mouth is that right if there you talk about a of a perfect man but we're coming to that brother you're not going to be any less brother said Jesus became man so man become God you're going to be in that stature of a perfect man you're just going to be just like Jesus amen exactly glory is that right so brother Ren was telling us right here how to build a temple is that right a tabernacle today where he can live right everybody agrees with that right amen do you know what the word pyramid means pyramid py means light or fire in the middle that's what you got in you fire right in the middle of you light right in the middle of you one of the big thing on a Feast of Tabernacles you go read it it's light right God sent a revelation in this hour a fire down in me you understand what I'm saying a pyramid and you know what you go look at the pyramids over there if you look at the pyramid you see in the picture now what you you got is a bunch of rough stones have you ever seen it do you know that on that pyramid was smooth stones at one time you know they came in and they they chiseled and burnt and got that smooth Stones off now let me tell you a secret on that okay when he built that up the rough Stones you were rough yeah you carried a club on your back you were the Rough Stones is that right so when he built the Tabernacle what did he build it out of first the rough Stones the Jews rejected him right so he took a a gentile for his for his name's sake right a bride what's he doing rough and we're rough buddy yeah we Gentiles are rough that's right is that right rough but it's Tabernacles remember y so there's where the next thing that they put on it was smooth Stones yeah now the rough Stones there's approximately 2.5 million but they don't know how many there are the Gentiles aren't numbered the rough stones but then the finished Stones went on do you know how many of them there are thank you 144,000 don't tell me we're not under the Feast of Tabernacles don't tell me God hasn't built that pyramid in the day we're in the Gentiles are the rough stones and then the next Bunch that's coming back are the Jews that's going to be the smooth Stone it ain't going to take him 2,000 years to take me and polish like he's said to polish me and you up he don't have to polish out them trinitarian Doctrine I mean they stick a needle through a word a Bible and know where it's at right so it ain't going to take him 2,000 years to polish them up they're already pretty polished up right but they're going to find out right exactly and that's what's going to complete the pyramid now I'm going to tell you that pyramid City that comes up who's going to live there right the bride and the 144,000 brother renom was telling us in this message exactly the Tabernacle that he is building to come and live in and it's you you understand that take it real personal the feast that t is you you know I told the church that the one thing about the Feast of Tabernacles The Dwelling Place had to be rude I said have you ever seen anything as rude as this I said look at his face his big head this big nose it is rude is't that what it is rude we're all kind of that way right this Fe it's a temporary dwelling it's where where you take it down travel put it back up right so see we're under the Feast of tabernac I still carry a rude dwelling around with me one of these days I ain't going to be rude I'm going to be 20 years old in my Prime there will be nothing rude about it you understand what I'm saying that's why I say it that Tabernacle was a rough Stones were rough you see what I'm saying so that's what God's Building but it's a fire in the middle of it right is that right that's right is that what the new birth is it's a fire the logos in the middle of it is that right and that heat is going to vulcanize every one of those attributes you see right there in that pyramid is that right that's what brother br was talking about and I I believe it's where he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be I do but I am that pyramid do you know brother said it was a time tested church do you know the only thing that survived the flood was the pyramid why it tipe me right exactly he said if he if devil raises a standard God would right raise a standard up against it the only thing that survived the flood was the pyramid right well look right Glory that's the thing that survived it right the only thing that's going to survive this whole thing is the pyramid The Dwelling Place of the Living God that's you are the ones that's going to survive it you understand amen it's the truth so you got the Feast of Tabernacles do you know let's go to St John 7 if you would I'm moving along pretty good see you're easy to preach to CU you've been taught you understand let's go to Ephesians 4 first would you do you know brother brandom there was only two places that he used the text of Ephesians 4 yeah do you know that you know where it was where he used the text of Ephesian 41-15 there's only two places he used that scripture as one of his text scriptures you know what it was you must be born again and the stature of a perfect man what's going to bring you to the stature of a perfect man the fivefold ministry right amen see that's why people I don't understand around the message of why they don't put any value in a fivefold minister they'll play tapes they won't even give them Pastor when old Pastor dies I know churches six seven years down the road and they're bringing preacher in every weekend they ain't got a pastor yet well how are they going to come in the Statue of a perfect man without a pastor it takes the fivefold ministry to bring you into a stature of a perfect man cuz this guy's going to smooth you up you rough Gentiles you understand he's going to put some cement on you which is love y right to get this thing to stick together is that right and this ain't no man-made see in either this is love that's going to see in you got love in this brother gar I would to God that there' be such a love in a congregation that God can sweep down and heal you while you're sitting in your seat now that's cement buddy that's love that's what this church is coming to you understand this bride is coming to that where the love of God will sweep down and heal you set in your sins is that right amen sure exactly let's read four and what is 11 and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists I want you to read I'm going to slow down and he gave some Apostles semicolon does everybody see that right okay and some prophets semicolon some evangelists semicolon and some pastors and teachers your pastor ought to be apt to teach right there's no semicolon between that office is there's nothing difference between a pastor and a teacher some days when I come out Sunday morning I say look I don't know how it's going to be till I get in the Pulpit number one if I'm the pastor part I tell them I'm a screaming M Mei is that right you just let her fly buddy but sometimes I come out and when I get in the Pulpit the anointing there is to be a teacher right with that pastoral gift and I've had people say somebody's a teacher and I thought am I reading that wrong if he's a pastor he's supposed to be able to teach what are they saying but you can go to churches around the message of the hour and you can tell when the people aren't taught try to preach there I have it's like pulling teeth you understand there's no pull I'm doing you know what I'm saying but when you go to a church like this where you're well taught it is easy for me to get In a Pulpit and teach because why you've been taught do you know that under the Feast of Tabernacles Jesus went into the temple and taught right that was a big thing in St John 7 look at it and I can't read it cuz I'm going to hurry through this cuz I got to have some time but the Feast of Tabernacle Jesus told them they said Jesus it's the great feast go read it in chapter 7 let's read a little bit of it I have to read some scripture right let's go to Ephesians 7 I don't want to get in a hurry you I don't want to make get nervous here St John 7 excuse me one day I was preaching in the I got to tell on my wife can I tell I may have told this before but I was preaching one day at the church and I told a certain scripture and I start I read the first verse and all of a sudden I heard this sister on the second row which was my wife say where you at and I'm sitting here reading the scripture I thought I look my wife was say where you at you're not in the right place I looked down at my Bible yeah I looked at her she said you're not in the right place so then I started reading it again she said you're not in the right place and so I looked everybody in the church was looking at her going yeah he's right he's right and then she said oh I wasn't I was in the wrong book you know so I went on read the scripture and pretty soon I looked up I said I got to stop for a minute I said I just love it when I'm right and got witnesses that going happen you're laughing sister Peggy but I like it when I'm when I'm right and I got witnesses to so I just stopped right there I said you know what I've been married 35 years to this woman I love it when I'm right is that right man ain't that right don't you just love it when you're right and you got witnesses to prove it but if you don't have witnesses to prove it it ain't any good I I had a whole church load of people that start laughing I said oh I just love it when I'm right and I have witnesses to it you know so that's good isn't it let's go to chapter 7 and these things Jesus walked in Galilee do you see that word Galilee that's important when you read this chapter and and if you go home read 71 through St John 9:7 and you'll get to feel for what the Feast of Tabernacle is okay it tells you all the attributes of it there's just not one attribute to the Feast of Tabernacles there's several different attributes to it okay but he walked in Galilee okay important now the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was at hand right and they sought to kill him I missed that in the first one his Brethren his Brethren does everybody understand these weren't unbelievers these were Brethren that sought The Killing we understand that we've been in the message there long enough to understand that one don't his Brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into Judea that thy disciples Also may see the works that thou do us see they wanted works right right the Jews seeketh after a s constantly wanted works for there is no man that doeth anything in secret amen and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself to the world for neither did his Brethren believe in him right they didn't believe him all the signs all the Miracles they didn't believe him is that right now it made a turn his ministry he's starting to teach now that's when they started haing brother it wasn't when he had to First pull second pull but when he started speaking the word is that right he started teaching the message of the hour went out that's when they started hating him they hated his Doctrine is that right and he told the SC the the the uh disciples behold their Doctrine that's the leav right they hated what Jesus said and what he taught is that right I hate what you teach too exactly where did I leave off okay thank you then Jesus said to them my time is not yet come but your time is always ready the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because I testify of it now what is he saying he's separating light from dark in the Feast of Tabernacles a big attribute of the Feast of Tabernacles is light what is light Revelation under the Feast of Tabernacles did we get get some Revelation oh yeah what is it the stimulation of Revelation another part of the Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of Tabernacles when they were gathering in the fruit yeah the bread crops was during the Feast of Pentecost the Jubilee the 50th one the last bread crop had been brought in does everybody understand that but in the Feast of the Tabernacles it was fruit y does everybody understand it was fruit that was starting to be brought in of the Feast of Tabernacles it was what it was the olive what do they use olives for oil they brought the grapes in what was the grape for wine what is this day oil and wine touch not right you think the devil can touch you only God can allow that you understand if something comes on you it's simply because God's trying to cook some of this into you the whole purpose of God is to build a dwelling place is that right so if anything is allowed upon you you ought to thank God for it because all it is is trying to give you some Temperance right you understand it's trying what did Brother say patience was to be patient with God if you ask for something here I've asked for things here it is 25 years later I still don't have it but I'm will to be patient with God cuz he said if I'll ask if I believe it you ask it in my name I will give it to you brother r s the church a but if you'll speak the word I will perform it does everybody understand all you got to do is be patient for God all you got to do is thank him for getting it and that what brother BR said thank him for it that's right go ye on up feet yeah when he when he had said these words unto them he Abode still in Galilee yeah he was in Galilee right but when his Brethren were gone gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly this is the key to the Feast of Tabernacles that's right but as it were in secet right did we have a secret coming in 1963 did he come he's here when did he come Feast the Tabernacles when did he go to Jerusalem right right he went to the temple right if you go read it he went and taught in the temple what was it light does everybody understand now if you go read down I'm not going to read any further I just wanted to show you that he actually healed a lame man y didn't he change your Walk of Life right am weren't you not walking right Glory right he corrected it under Feast of Tabernacles you understand there was a blind man that was blind right was was it blind Le oia right did he give you sight right Feast of Tabernacles this is all the attributes of the Feast of Tabernacles that you got up there on the wall right God is light right what came in this day a revelation God has give you bride a revelation where you're not blind anymore I don't I'm not lay to sin I've been caught up hither higher after this after the church Ages come up hither right Feast of Tabernacles is what he's talking about right is that right y it really is but one thing they said they said the people were sitting there he went into the temple and they didn't get him Jesus said it's not my time right they couldn't why cuz he'd be killed during the Passover right right not during the Feast of Tabernacles he said my time is not yet come he knew that he was the Passover Lamb so he couldn't die at A Feast of Tabernacles he'd have to die at the Feast of Passover is that right so what did he do he said my time has not yet come he wasn't worried about dying he had to fulfill the scripture he had to set a a type in the scripture what was it he come in the Feast of Tabernacles he came in the Feast of Tabernacles does everybody understand just want to repeat that right there a lot of people in this message still don't believe he's here yeah right do you understand that they're looking for him to come yeah oh my they argue over that right they even believe that brother brandom asked to come back to preach that nod had something oh Lord so that they can get rapturing Faith come on rapturing faith lies in the message is that right he already preached his message and God took him home is what it was God don't take a messenger home before it's time you got then God's clowning around with us if he took William brand homes bring him back to preach me a message if you see brother random the rapture's on buddy you better you better say yippe cuz if you see brother brand I guarantee it's going to be a split second later you're going to be changed then we're in that 30 or 40 days is that right then I go woohoo right and I go woohoo now because I am the Rapture how can I miss it when I am the Rapture right man you talk about a sure thing we've been given in this sure word of Prophecy that's what we've been giving in this end time that's right I don't have I don't have no there's no Darkness around me I'm not blind it's light is that right the light has come he's here it's a complete realization of who he is when I was talking about that Jewish man that I talked to when I went home I preached on the Key of David yeah you know what brother man said the Key of David is complete realization when can that come Feast of Tabernacles that's when it come do you understand so I'm not I don't I'm not wondering what he is I have a revelation I know what he is that's right every day I pick up the love letter and the message they're all one like I told the church if you go to th and I'm no I got to hurry I'm not I'm not going to take much longer okay do I have all afternoon take a break there you go there you go so Jesus in in St John 4 with Nicodemus right he told Nicodemus you must be born again is that he told him and Nicodemus said this he said can I crawl back into my mother's womb you know he was thinking terrestrial body he was thinking earthy is that right he wasn't thinking Heavenly he was thinking earthy as what he was exactly but you know he said you being a teacher and you don't know these things right you don't know them but you know what I thought well okay well how would he know it what scripture said you must be born again right Ezekiel 36 right is that right exactly now I going to use an example Jesus didn't say the exact words of Ezekiel he paraphrased the scripture is that right he said ye must be born again do you know what if I paraphrase the message of the hour they'll put you out Jesus paraphrased the Bible thank you is that right Hallelujah I told him as long as I say this message there and I keep the continuity on I'm okay but Jesus the absolutely my example did not quote the scripture verba he voted he quoted it with some Revelation in it is what he did and when I quote this message of the hour I got some light on it you understand what I'm saying it's not a dead letter so if I don't quote every jot and tit of the message they say you're not saying what brother brandom said I think you note you need to go see what he said as long as I quote it and I keep the continuity of it it's okay because I'm going to be honest with you I put some I tell the church I put some OK bonics On It come on I'm from we have oky bonics there we have words we use that you don't use out here when he said what do you say that read the Bible before they're going to what how did you say that I thought what's that I didn't know what that was that's Georgia bonic to me you understand but God he's going to quote the message of the hour and he's going to put it where you can get the revelation of it brother R said his job is to get the cool his room and break it down so that the people might receive it is that what the fivefold is to break it down where you can receive it where it becomes a part of you where you're starting to create a dwelling place for God because like we said the logos that's in you that new body is going to materialize around the word that you got in you so every service we're giving him word he's feeding you word he's feeding you word and one day your body change that new body is going to materialize around the word that you got in you and that word is light you understand it's the Feast of Tabernacle where you're at right now is that right so the Feast of Tabernacles is the feast that yours currently under but all the feasts come under you have to be a part you got to walk Jesus walked up and down through all the feast days does everybody understand that when he got before the priest at age 12 and he taught him in the Tabernacle that was the Feast of Pentecost is that right so he went to the Feast of Passover he went to the Feast of Pentecost he went to the Feast of Tabernacle there was three requirements you had to go to if you were an Israelite he made every one of them right and you will too Glory that's right now let me tell you something you ever thought of this you got three set times a week you're supposed to be here yeah that's right pretty tough isn't it now I'm going to get really tough on you three set times and you know what every time I go to an eye doctor they want to dilate my eyes Wednesday afternoon now how am I going to read scripture and preach I'll tell them I'll say look I'm going to church tonight right how many of you miss church and you know it's a set time yeah and you purposely get something that you're going to have to miss church on oh yeah and you won't talk to them and say you know what I need to be there where do you think we come up in America where there's three services a week yeah that is just not happen chance you understand what I'm saying we have three set times and it was expected for every male Jew to be there y y you think God changes his mind about his word your pastor has gave you three set times to be here am I getting where I'm coming from you need to be here and you fix your schedule where you will be here that's right right you understand right I'm not trying to be a legalist but I'm telling you I prove that to you in the scripture it's not an accident we set three times you work your schedule around it where you can be in church now we're not going to be so dogmatic if you know they got to do whatever I had a man a preacher in my church come to me he said I'm going to take a job he's not there anymore by the way I'm going to take a job that pays a dollar more an hour but I'm not going to be able to be in Sunday and he was in my back office talking to me I said okay I said no I got one question to ask you are you going to go out in that church lot after service and tell the people that God gave you that job he looked at me he said no I said good cuz if you did I would correct you in front of the people God ain't going to give you a job where you have to miss church you understand what I'm saying if you got a job and you switch that job to get a job that you got to work on Sundays you better find you another job you need to be in service does everybody understand there is no brother said you got the Holy Ghost you can't wait till them Church doors open is that right you need to set your time and your schedules where you can be here to hear the word there's no greater privilege that you have as a people than to come here and hear the word of God where the light is going forth and that light will absolutely get into your body and it'll become you is that right and that's the way that new body is going to materialize around you is that right exactly a lot of people take it for granted coming to church you need to be here right I'm not trying to be a dogmatic but honestly when I seen that I've out had a shout right it's the truth he said time where he would know that they would put everything aside to be there right does everybody understand and that's why we do Church three times a week you need to be there whatever you got to do congregation to be here you better start doing it if your job's making you miss here you ask God to get you a new job cuz you want to be in church everybody understand but this preacher told me a dollar an hour I said okay he works 40 hours a week four times I'm pretty good at math 4 time40 $160 when he preached for me I'd give him $200 check he'd preached three times for me he forfeited $600 that he couldn't be there on Sunday to preach for me to gain $160 does anybody does that make sense to anybody I'm the only one that thought what in the world are you thinking brother man what was it there was something else working in his life exactly it wasn't long after that he left you understand and went back out in the world there was the real deal right right you understand but you need to be here in church right amen you really do you need to be brother said you need to be at your post to do exactly little why I said that that didn't cost you that's free you don't have to pay me for that but it's the truth isn't it it really is BL let me read a quote so you can validate what I said future home so old man and old woman don't you be discouraged if you are a representation up here in this attribute of God he's God if you have if you're represented here you cannot you're in the Eternal and if you cross that seventh day into the Eighth Day you got into the Eternal by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're included in this now if you're just trusting Upon A S and you said this last night a sensation or jumping up and down or I appreciate you told them that there's a lot of people preachers won't tell them that you know that that was good so you told them what your experience was but you counting on that right you were counting when God come down on the inside of the inside and you got your new birth is that right it's not by emotionalism it's not a sensation now I believe once you get it you're going to have some emotion if you got a baby that's a new birth and that baby don't cry that's a dead baby so you're going the emotionalism S is going to come after the birth you understand that's right a sensation of jumping up down I do this I keep a seventh day I don't eat meat and things like that that's going to perish in the elect see but this is the Eternal this is the Eternal the feast after the Feast of Tabernacles see the Feast of Tabernacles was the last Feast the seventh Feast right we're worshiping now exactly under the Feast of the Tabernacles that's right the seventh Church age right we are feasting now right under the the Feast of Tabernacles does everybody understand that exactly and brother Brandon preached this right here to show you that right right here so the Feast of Tabernacles I can tie it right into here brother AB is what it is amen and you know when you look at the I I and I don't know if you looked at the word Tabernacle does anybody don't know the word Tabernacle is not a masculine word right it's a feminist word so that Feast of Tabernacles was a type of you right and it was a type of Christ lo I come in a volume of the book it's WR to me okay but that was you you understand that Tabernacle in the wilderness Tabernacle is a femin word that Tabernacle in the wilderness was you amen have you ever thought what was in that third compartment sure Mana Aaron's Rod right budded blossomed had fruit on it is there fruit in there yeah the law you know the law convert the soul is that what it says amen got see Jesus Christ people think that Jesus Christ came did away with the law no he fulfilled the law exactly you know brother random explained Grace like this grace is you got a sign that says 55 mil hour you know what Grace is you'll drive 50 you know brother random had a quote he said that you the bride is the final voice to the final age under her Messenger right brother BR said don't go 55 and you go 56 you're not under your messenger see you're here to do one thing fulfill this message of the hour your testimony right is what the prophecy was all about that's right and brother R said don't do this or your Miss dog meat then you won't do it because why you got a holy ghost that won't let you do it exactly you want to know Grace there's Grace you got the Holy Ghost and he won't let you do these things so if you you got to realize Lucifer exalted himself against Michael is that right he was cast down you going to exhaust yourself against this message and you think the result ain't going to be the same you're kidding yourself right you better get under your messenger right the only way you are the final voice of the final age is under your messenger does everybody understand that exctly that's what we are right God's good to us isn't he I'm going to stop there it's 12:00 I know you're hungry cuz I'm hungry okay but Lord bless you you're easy to to teach it's more of a teaching message today this afternoon I'm going to rake you good so I'm going to I always want to church when I come out I say look I'm going to whoop you today yeah you know no daddy likes to spank their kids right you think a pastor likes to correct you all the time oh we would like to come out here and teach predestination and adoption but sometimes you just got to bring your belt out exactly is that right amen it's the truth we don't like to do those things sometimes
