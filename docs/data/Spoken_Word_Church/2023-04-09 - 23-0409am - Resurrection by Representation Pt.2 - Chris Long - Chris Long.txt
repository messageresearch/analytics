here it was a good Friday hey man we had a good time brother Dutch Scott just did give us a masterpiece and we sure appreciate that and then also yesterday we had our fellowship meeting brother Chris poured his heart out to us well today we have no second service so he's going to just preach as long as he wants to preach and he's going to tell you listen if Jesus Christ can hang on the cross for three hours with Nails in his hands come on somebody they're nailed in his feet his back tore all to pieces up against that it wasn't a slick cross either they didn't have a they didn't have a planer back then it was so rough if he can hang for three hours me and you can hang for three hours in this building listening to the word of the Lord because he's risen he's out of the grave yesterday a lot of Silence he was still working but today as brother Dutch was talking about those feet now came out of that tomb hey man he came out of that tomb with a roar all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me and then what did he say is going to do with it how he's going to just take it back to heaven and he's just going to keep it to himself right no no he said I'm gonna give it to you all right I'm gonna give it to you my children so you're a recipient of that and for those of you that are born again today you know he's risen there's no doubt in your mind that he came out of that grave and now he lives inside of our heart and I hope today that he does the same thing again he did yesterday just give us a message that we can hear and that we can receive what's going on thank all your

Lord I told him to take his time and we may do some singing afterwards because we got nowhere else to go there's a better place for you to go right now you need to go on out the door [Music] not trying to be mean if there's a better place that you think you need to be you need to go out that door right there because right here's where God's going to talk to us right right here today in this Temple he's going to take your Tabernacle and he's going to use that Tabernacle to speak to your Tabernacle and if it's the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is going to always come together are you going to be the most uncomfortable person that ever lived on the face of this Earth and I hope you are because I became you know I became comfortable in the world one time amen I'm not the only one I

holy holy holy holy holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I want to see you hallelujah amen that's who we've come to see this morning do you really want to see him he's turn around and say God bless you brother I see him right now amen you should be able to see him and each and every one of us this morning if he's living in our hearts that was his plan the condensing down from an invisible God to visibility to tangibility amen I like it amen makes me feel good because now we know what life's purpose really is amen God bless you this morning um I'm just real pleased and it's a real pleasure and a real privilege to be in the house of God with each and every one of you and um I can't think of a better place to be unless we were all over on the other side and we were given testimonies of what God has done for us amen now of course this is we're here this morning to honor the resurrection and of course it is the anniversary of uh the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we just want to ask the Lord to help us this morning to be able to come to a conclusion uh I didn't I didn't say this before but it it ha it has been said in the previous two Services by uh comments that were made and that is that our purpose the reason why we're here is the conclusion of the whole matter it really is God is good all the time love him with all my heart we're just going to get right into the message if that's okay I still want you to go to Romans chapter 8 we're going to read verse 11. I want to start out this morning again on something in the Bible that took place on Friday night before the crucifixion so that we can really come to an understanding of what or who was really crucified amen amen the the world celebrates it as as the man and we of course keep the Hoffman's head at 33 uh painting a copy of it there because the prophet of God said that in all the different places that he'd seen him that's the that's the the artist that captured uh pretty much what he looked like when he was a man here on Earth and today there is a celebration of course uh around the world Easter and and uh they they they they focus so much on the man that they forget about God we're interested in God in the man amen now I believe that was the god man yeah I believe that was the vessel that God used that God created that God brought into existence so that he could fulfill his plan to live amongst his attributes his children which are you and I we're going to find out this morning what really was crucified on Calvary it was not just a man amen Romans 8 11. listen careful now watch this scripture but if the spirit now that's a capital S but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead now watch careful it doesn't say but if the word of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in here it says but if the spirit he that raised up Christ from the dead now I thought they were one and the same and they are but the word Christ is used so that God can separate himself from one being into many Christ is the anointing or the anointed one or the anointed ones he that he raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken that means make Alive Now activate give life to your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you father we thank you Lord this morning for your grace and your mercy I I pray Lord that you'd help me now Lord as we go through your word father and find the places Lord where you are revealing to us Lord where we came from Who We Are and our final destination Lord help us all I pray Lord let life activate itself in the hearts of the Believers Lord let this Spirit Quicken that body word Lord that's laying within us father so that we also Lord could not just have that life but become that life Lord that's your perfect plan this morning Lord we yield and surrender to you and will always be careful to give you all the honor and the glory and the praise in the precious and Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated now he did hang on Calvary for three hours so that you would not have to sit here and suffer me to preach three hours it's okay Paul said if I could just deliver five words of understanding just five I will have accomplished more than all of the unknown tongues that come into existence is that right so let me start out like this if you would now if it's all right we're we're we had Sunday school but I feel like we're still in Sunday school this morning and uh we we want to cover some scriptures uh I have right here in front of me what I'd like to read out of the message of the hour if it'll just stay illuminated for me um I I haven't come to the place in my life where I am a gadget guy but I do like uh the the things that make life easier um and make life better for us uh most of the time they become a distraction uh and and and and Satan is the god of distraction uh but we don't care it's like the automobile we use it because it came into existence and uh it's faster than walking it gets us to where we need to be you can live much further away from your from your place of worship or your place of work than you used to be able to live uh in times past you had to live at least a a horse and buggy uh distance or walking distance away now they come from the east and west they come from a land of far amen so I thought maybe I'd start out real real and I and I'm I'm a simple guy I love God's word now now we we receive God God delivers himself in simplicity is that right but God himself is certainly far from what we would consider to be simple he's the creator of all that exists and of course science tries is confounded by the fact that um they can't come to an understanding of of Where it All Began they are looking for it uh and they will never find it in the way that they're looking because now now remember something about science it does require a certain amount of Faith because they're they're they're they're they're employing themselves to look into areas that uh are without understanding and they're trying to figure out how to get there now I'll tell you this as I've said it before the word of God is how you do it but you still have to put your faith in the word of God all right so I would like for you to turn to begin this morning's lesson to Saint John chapter 18. now the more that I um uh indulge in the word of God I'd say study but and it does say that study yourself to be approved the more I indulge in God's word the more I find out that the Book of John is the very reason why that he was chosen by God to go out on the Isle of Patmos and be used as what we call John the Revelator because John's character and makeup um uh seemed to have a particular way about itself and he uh he by his Simplicity remember he was the um the disciple that always was always seen laying sort of in the bosom you know either Jesus was always hugging him to hang on to him or he was always hugging Jesus to get something from him it worked both ways you know you wouldn't think that Jesus needed a prop but he was he was a man yeah he was somebody uh the character of Love who who wanted to express and extend that love um and very few people understood that at the time he was here it was like brother Dutch saying that on Friday night that the the disciples and all the followers of Jesus and I'll say it like this perhaps just the 120 who made it to the upper room now think about Jesus was God In the Flesh he wasn't just a preacher or a prophet he was God In the Flesh and at the end of his life and all of the sermons that he preached and and the love that he projected and and all of the profound statements that he made there were only a hundred and twenty people who somehow caught the essence that this must be more than a man there's something more to him than just a fellow walking through the streets of Galilee and we probably ought to put our faith or what little or what much we have in what he said a hundred and twenty now I'm not good at guessing numbers there must be 60 80 100 here this morning now so we're almost to the size of the entire class that ended up that's why that's why fear not little flock that's why the prophet said it would at the end it would just be a small amount of people now you know that I I say this to my church because we're not we're we're only a third of the size maybe of what you've got here in in membership and and and some and some ministers take those statements that brother Branham made like fear not little flock out of the scripture and and that it would be a small group and that you'd be the my own nordian and they try to enforce that do you know what I mean by that they try to keep the group small by rubbing people the wrong way I mean can I use a phrase uh ticking them off [Laughter] okay I know I'll bet yeah and people get off yeah see they think they're fulfilling the scripture by doing that I don't agree with that it's to whosoever Will as many or as few would come but I'm I'm I'm I'm seeing this morning something that that I I would like to convey to you to start and that is really really did they crucify a man or were they trying to silence the god in the man so you got Saint John 18. they couldn't silence the god in the man so they had to get rid of the man well what they didn't realize is you can't kill God so God said I'll show him they'll try to silence me but I'm not going to be silenced I'll continue to work through the same vessel that they thought they were going to silence me through I will raise it up from the dead I will re-enter that vessel and I will continue to use that vessel amen so if you got Saint John 18 lots of places to start from and I think maybe verse 28 if you're okay with that Jesus brought before Pilate would that be okay then let they Jesus from caiaphasis under the Hall of judgment now where does judgment begin judgment according to Saint Peter Begins the house of God and it was early and they themselves went not into the Judgment Hall do you know why because they didn't want to it's going to say this lest they should be defiled why wouldn't they want to go into the place where God said judgment begins because they were self-righteous and they did not think they had any impediments that required for them to go into the Judgment Hall and if they in fact were seen going into the Judgment Hall as you are seen coming into the house of God this morning people might think oh they must have something wrong with them I got lots of things wrong with me so I throw myself at the mercy of the court of God's word so that I can be watch now loved yeah by God Amen what are you saying brother judgment and love judgment begins at the house of God and the prophet of God said love is corrective always now correction does not always mean punishment see we equate it with punishment because when dad takes you to the woodshed he isn't going out there to sit on a stump and talk with you he's meeting out punishment because we're in a body of Flesh still with me verse 28 now but that they might eat the Passover 29 pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation brings ye against this man they answered and said unto him if he were not a male effector what does that mean that means a bad character okay we would not have delivered him up unto thee then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the Jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death what a pack a hypocrite they were bringing him to a place where they knew that their own judgment and Justice would be meted out upon this man and that the penalty would be death hypocrites do we know anybody like that the world is in this condition right now and it's all leading up to one thing amen amen the demise of true Christianity not Christianity the way the world wants it to be painted I just read a headline I come across my phone a week ago where the Pope who is considered by the world the head of Christianity and he had the audacity to make this statement that Ramadan and I'm not against the Muslim communities is important to Christianity no it's important to the pope because he is going to be you don't see in the in in in the world we live in right now you don't see much about the Pope well it happens to be because the man that's in the office right now is not the man that's going to do the the D no that man that they call Pope whatever his name in is not the man because God sent a prophet and that Prophet Prophet told us and I believe what that Prophet said he said that that Pope that would cause the world to go into the tribulation is coming out of the United States did you know that did you have you read that and you say well no the the the the board of the committee that's going to select and elect the next Pope or the next three popes and they got nobody on the list you don't need to be on their list he's on God's list let's keep reading amen because I'm gonna take my time is that okay but it won't be three hours don't you worry about that all right it is not lawful for us to put any man to death verse 32 that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spakes signifying what death he should die then pilate see they were fulfilling prophecy then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews now watch it gets it gets a little thick right here Jesus answered him saith thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it does that ring a bell who do you say I the son of man am well some say or this and some say or that and some say you're there that's something you're the prophet something maybe but I want to know who you think who you believe what Revelation you personally have of who I am that's really what he's asking pilot okay watch now pilate answered wrong answer yeah it wasn't Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God it's am I a Jew thine own Nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence you mean his servants actually would have fought for him if this world was his kingdom well I can tell you that the Bible says that Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and Satan and his angels so there is a battle going on Amen it's been going on since the beginning of creation creation is when God brought something out of nothing he brought something out of an eternal being and brought it down into time time began as soon as creation began because this God we serve and please don't try to figure this out you will go insane he had no beginning not as human beings as well he had to start somewhere that's the human being right they didn't crucify him for being a good man They Crucified him watch now for being an instrument in time that an eternal being existed in amen without beginning and without end every child of God whether you realize it or not this morning had no beginning oh no brother I was born December 11 1956 at such and such a time that's my birthday but there was something about me about you something that that that that brought you into existence we're always looking back at it the other way what brought us into existence did you know that the prophet of God said that the gene germ of Levi was activated in Abraham but he was a great grandson but the germ was activated in Abraham how how in the world were did you get here through your ancestry when we know that the germ of life that produced you came from your father it was because Abraham simply paid tithes and that tithe pain that would eventually reach the priesthood of Levi down through several Generations was the activation of The Germ of Levi now that's the natural what we want this morning is the activation of that Eternal germ you say Well it had to start somewhere the spoken word is the original seat the word seed means beginning did you know that if you read in Genesis you find out that the first thing that came into existence watch it now was not like oh brother I've got it right here in Genesis but did you read the scripture and God said let there be light so before light there was sound there was a voice there was something that came out of something and spoke and right there The Original Seed came into existence now remember something and I've probably preached this here before but it's okay some of you don't know me I'm going to give it to you the way that God has given it to me do you all believe that Adam came from God if Adam came from God then Adam was eternal Adam had watch watch watch had eternal life what do you mean he had eternal life you just told us that if you are are God's son or daughter that you never had a beginning that's right see I wanted this morning take the time to Define what was really crucified like I was beginning to say last night the real me the real you brother Luis is not the man I see it's not even the man I hear it's not the man I pay attention to there's another you in there [Music] he's the one you go to bed at night with him he's the one you keep secrets from all your yeah he's the one who knows that whether you did right or wrong he he he's she or he it's the person okay so remember in Genesis let us make man in our image and after our likeness we are told and believed that that was a spirit man because it was made in the image of God and I believe it's in Saint John 4 24 where it says God is a spirit now you cannot kill and you cannot crucify a spirit spirits come into existence of course and can be taken out of existence but you cannot crucify a spirit wow amen so I take this piece of paper and brother Louise okay if I use you for an example you see I'm going to use brother Luis this morning as not the Fallen Adam but Adam the Son of God how's that now this piece of paper represents eternal life a portion of God like the Lake of Fire the Lake of Fire that fell on the day of Pentecost and came into the hearts of the Believers was a portion of the Eternal being of God but being represented in the Lake of Fire so that it can be seen it could be identified it could be talked about it could be written down about it could be conveyed but how are you going to convey a spirit here I'm gonna convey the spirit right now that's God's spirit right there now Adam had eternal life and that eternal life was based on one premise and that premise was keep my word amen so therefore if you have to keep his word in order to maintain eternal life his word and his life are one now when Adam chose to save a part of himself which we call Eve he had to make a decision and that decision was do I give up what God has given me to save her or do I let her go Adam being a son of God Adam having a portion of God had a revelation what was his revelation I'm going to lay my life down because I have a representation that's going to raise it up again may I have that brother Louise I know you don't want to give up your eternal life but it's only temporary it only it lasted less than three days when God decided I'm gonna I'm gonna make myself the perfect example now brother Bradham said that when Adam partook of the forbidden fruit to save Eve's life it was Christ so the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you it will it and and you don't realize that brothers and sisters maybe but the preaching of the word is the quickening power not because it's the letter on the page not because it's a repeating of what someone else said but because it's Life coming through a vessel and then conveying a word from God that activates the seed inside of you and say I see that that's it that's life I didn't know when I was lost and undone in the world brother Donnie that there was something inside of me that was crying and groaning and wishing for something better but I would sit down with a can of beer and a and a marijuana cigarette and sit there and say it I'd had friends that did the same thing and I don't remember any of them sitting down and saying is this it what was it in me what was it in you let me finish the scripture let me get to a point you still here Jesus answered my kingdom verse 36 is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then when my servant servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him are thou a king then jeez I don't see how he got that question out of that answer all right thou a king then yeah yeah Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king listen you mean by a question just the very fact Jesus knew just the very fact that this was permeating inside of Pilate our Thou King phallus said no I didn't say that I asked you yeah the question revealed to Jesus that pilate knew but he was unwilling to admit because pilate also was a man of authority all right but I want to get down to this part thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth amen amen everyone that is of the truth watch now Hearth my voice why because the spoken word is the original seed and the Original Seed is truth and pilate goes on and says what is truth right did you realize right there indicates to us they were crucifying the truth because they didn't want the truth I looked up the word truth and it says actuality fact Fidelity which is similar to Faith or faithful and constancy like constant comes from the root of true the word true and true means ideal essential consistent typical steadfast loyal honest just legitimate rightful and accurate so really really the confusion for for pilate was what is essential what is ideal see he's asking what is truth what is consistent yeah what is typical what is steadfast what is loyal see these are the the definitions we'd say synonyms but the definitions of Truth and he says what is truth wow he didn't have a clue what is honest what is just what is legitimate what is rightful what is accurate do you know where the word true came from now this is not a pun or a play on words but the very root of the word true comes from the word tree that's what my dictionary said same one you all can use the Merriam-Webster yeah that's right and I saw that and I said oh brother Donnie I'm going to tell you what came to me yeah two trees what looks like two truths Jesus said if you're of the truth you will hear me he says what is truth I don't understand [Music] that's because of the two trees he that heareth my word he that believeth truth that would be those that came from the Tree of Life those that are asking the question like pilate would have have to emanate it from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you see how how how there's a contrast now there's a contrast prophet of God speaks about that without contrast if there wasn't a a bad one we wouldn't know what a good one was a amount he uses the word bad woman did you know that what's the woman a type of amen thank you so if there wasn't a bad one yeah we wouldn't know what a good one was how do we identify what a good church is depends on where you came from very simple so let me go here with you what is truth well let's just get back to the basics God is a spirit now God g-o-d the word god is an object of worship the the word god listen now it's not eternal the word geod ude the spirit that brought that word into existence is eternal [Music] but he needed to to come out of an invisible world that nobody could see right right that nobody could comprehend and begin to condescend down in such a way where the plan that he had so he could fellowship with his children his attributes could come about believe that that's what they crucified They Crucified the idea of God wanting to fellowship with himself through his attributes they thought they could silence it they thought they could bring it to an end but they did not comprehend the truth if they would have just gone back before before Pilate would have brought Jesus he should have said um uh we're gonna we're gonna put him on a retainer uh I'm gonna let him out on bail I'm going to let him out on his or his own recognets and then I'm going to do a little background check here and then I'm gonna then I'll make a judgment based upon that and if he would have just went back into the Book of John just a little further Jesus said I am the way the truth he wouldn't have had to have asked the question what is truth he was truth he was the way he was life and if he would have just read that simple scripture pilate and came to a revelation of what was being conveyed he would have not crucified him and delivered him up why because his life you can't kill that amen so brothers and sisters there's something inside of us this morning if we've been born again of the word seed of God and the spirit of God has come down on that and activated there's something in us that says he in me is the power to lay this life down now what is eternal life what is it it's living for others and in order to live for others something's got to die what's Gotta Die you and me gonna die to live for others oh no brother I want to keep it for myself or to myself I don't have enough to give out then you're from the wrong side of the tracks because this is life and I'm not gonna make anybody in here feel bad this morning but I want you to ponder this do you have eternal life do you live for others I'm not talking about a grandma all living for her granddaughter that's easy yeah yeah I'm talking about you and I doing things outside of our normal circle like I have need to go to Samaria well what are you going to Samaria for we need groceries we're going to go shopping that's really what the disciples are going to do go buy food he said you go get the natural food I got some other groceries I got to deliver I'm gonna take it down to the well because I know by being God manifest In the Flesh that there is one of mine over at the well and she's pondering her life right now yeah you've had five and the one you're with is not yours how in the world did that guy know that how did he know that I was sitting on my front porch yeah pondering my own life amen there's more to us than meets the eye I can tell you that right now right and I'm preaching to you on Easter wait until I get to the quote but I want to just paint this picture so so easy it's not one of those pictures you know that's of the aspen trees like they do where I live and then you gotta study it real close oh there's a deer in there there's an elk in there there's a mountain lion and I never saw that before no this is plain yeah in plane so we realized that God's plan required him to begin to come down out of the invisible eternity that he dwelt in and he had to Institute time which by the way is our worst enemy it's fighting some of you right now man he's been up there for 20 minutes isn't it well I don't have a lifesaver and I don't have a button but I love God's word it changed my life changed my life I didn't realize that there was a spirit of God until I listened to the word of God now remember something about a seed here I'll pick this piece of paper I usually bring a big old avocado seed to the pulpit and the reason I do is because it's a large seed and you could see it and I like avocados so I ate whatever it was covering it okay okay that's why he said eat my flesh and drink my blood or you have no life in you right but I'll use this piece of paper every seed listen careful and we know that the spoken word is the Original Seed so I want to get every seed has a life in it and it is the life of the seed but without the spirit it just lays dormant it it's got life in it it's got its own life in it but it lays the dormant unless it comes in contact with the way God ordained it to Spring forth that's why Romans 8 says if the spirit be in you that was the spirit that was in the man we know as Jesus who said I have the power to lay my life down for this cause came I end of the world you tear this Temple down and in three days do you know when they were mocking and scourging and whipping and and kicking and spitting on and pulling as a beard that we're trying to destroy the temple amen we see Jesus on these pictures in the cross and and of course he's pretty Haggard looking them the Mel Gibson thing that the brother talked about The Passion of the Christ I mean that's pretty horrible but the prophet of God told us you couldn't recognize him as a man even his ribs were sticking out of his skin and I know what that does to people they go oh my goodness that man gave his life but did you realize who was doing it yeah yeah come on bro you say it was God oh the spirit of God left Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane because the spirit of God can not die it's Eternal it had no beginning it'll have no end so it had to remove itself from that body and that body was a human body in such a way where when he got to the Garden of Gethsemane his brother Dutch said and he saw what was coming he jumped and ran he gave up he said I can't do it he realized that the task was nearly insurmountable I don't think I can do it I want to do it but I don't think I can do it but something way down yeah where did that come from the spirit of God it already yeah where did that come from where did that thing way down on the inside of that man rise up and say yeah the lord giveth and the lord taketh away bless it be the name of the Lord not my will come on now not my will we know the prophet of God pointed out to us and it's obvious that the death of Calvary happened in Gethsemane the actual event itself on the cross was just the follow-through the repercussions of the battle In The Garden of Gethsemane which all of us battle amen should I help them or should I not do I care or don't I care does this matter or does this not matter and so on and so on and so on brothers and sisters but God has made a way for you and I to come through it all yeah don't let this shock you now but it's because he knew you I see the ministry from time to time began to discuss in different forums and platforms uh whether there was anything in you or not and I we have quotes to go both ways but what it boils down to is here's what's in you but you don't know it's in you because you're looking for something tangible you're looking for something through the telescope the microscope you're looking for something that you can get a hold of and you can't touch for knowledge you can't touch it if God saw you that's what he's calling to come to him you don't need that tangibility in you you don't need that substance what you need is faith faith is the activator yes brother Brandon said God when he said let there be light had to believe his own word he had to place faith in it why because he instituted the law of faith that's the reason why brother Brown said many a streetwalker could come to the prayer line because of a type of faith that they had and receive their healing and a good Sanctified godly woman would come to the line and get nothing it's powerful yeah how is that possible all things are possible see You've Got to Believe you've got to put all your confidence I'm going to say it like this you've got to pour all your life into what you believe and it matters what you believe amen so you want to put it in God's word amen amen because God's word has God's life in it but it doesn't stop there that's why I reiterated to you in Romans but if the spirit and brothers and sisters a lot of us walk around through life with the seed of God in us but never allow it to be activated oh don't worry I'm not preaching to you Pentecost but I am preaching to you that that Malachi 4 says he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers not the denomination but to the activation of the life that's the key now the seed that was meant for the people of the day we live in was the seed that God saved remember that the very first seed of any plant or tree I'll use the apple tree is that all right the very first seed that God ever planted of the first Apple Tree had every Apple Tree in it after that it had every Apple had ever seen it ever leave it at every lamb and every root you catch that we can see that what about when God plants a seed when God planted the seed that was him it had every son and daughter that would ever come that's why he said the first shall be last and the last shall be first because the first seed that was planted had all of God in it after that it began to Blossom and Sprout with the life of God but the original seat he swear it all came from and we are taught by the prophet that in the day you and I live in we're back first shall be last and the last shall be first where did God keep this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he kept it in the back part of his mind Moses didn't realize that at the time because he didn't live in the time you and I did but when he wanted to see God and God showed him his back God was showing him the beginning that seed was there Moses was was in God at the beginning but Moses in time was not produced at the beginning do you realize that the Fall In the Garden of Eden and what Satan did through the serpent was Satan believing in himself so much that he could plant an alternative seed mix it and come forth listen now as Christ where did he where did he miss it the germ come from the mail the field is the church that's why when the prophet of God came in the 20th century his battle was to get the field to see stop that seed stop that seed stop that seed stop saying don't take that don't take that don't take that here 's the original scene take this take this amen and we realize Through the Ages that many many many people and again brother Bradham I can quote you he said they're not lost don't say they're lost goes back to Martin Luther and John Wesley and so forth they're not lost he said they played their part but there is a time where there is a people who will not accept anything but all the word of God they will cast down their reasoning they will cast down everybody else's reasoning and and it doesn't watch now it doesn't make you an isolationist that's what a lot of people end up though all by themselves out there on that island you've heard me say it before you know the guy that was Shipwrecked and they finally came to rescue him years and years later one guy on the island I know it I use the one about get your own dirt y they finally show up years later and there's three huts three little huts on the island hey I thought you were Shipwrecked by yourself well I am what's that over there he says that's where I live he says what's that he says that's my church oh what's this other little Hut that was my church before I built that one it's my former church he didn't even get along with himself and that's what some of the problem is we just don't get along with ourselves that's why the word of God through the message of the hour is to inform you is to reveal to you is to give you a personal revelation of Who You Are by where you came from because once you know and are convinced that you came from God then you do have the power amen through that Revelation to lay your life down now we're thinking of the tomb of death of Calvary of crucifixion oh he said take up your cross he didn't say take up your cross and nail yourself to it and die like me he said take up your cross follow me ain't God good so we realized that I'm watching the clock say I don't know leave it Laura I'll finish my thoughts that I have on this page only only got one one and a half pages of notes but I like inspiration yeah I like notes I admire the men that can get them gadgets and they can just and they got their message down there and they scroll up and they can see that and they but that's not me God is the spirit is that right now if we would turn to our Bibles everybody knows these scriptures I'm going to read them I know the brothers put them up on the board Saint John chapter 1 verse one let's start there and we're and really I I you know the title of my message is resurrection by representation well let's see what really was crucified and what really resurrected of course the man rose from the dead but that man was busy working while everybody thought he was dead as I mentioned yesterday it was the seventh day that he was doing that work and denominationalism and the thought of denomination and how many knows what the word denomination means really do you really know I'm going to tell you what it means now by the way did you carry anymore who's got a dollar a five dollar bill a tenant give me a hundred not that would be the wrong kind of evangelism if somebody's got a bill in their pocket thank you brother that's all I need to see he's a good man he gave me one and that's because George Washington's on it now now the word denomination brother now how many knows the the older folk in here are going to know this some of you young people are going to learn some today this is a denominational note did you know that's what this is called now it has nothing to do with church but it is called a denominational note what is the denomination of this note we say it's one dollar but where they got the word denomination from if you break it down in Latin is the value of a name so they put George Washington worth a buck right you say wait a minute he was the first president he was the next race number one he was the first president he was probably one of the greatest presidents but they knew that more people would have the one dollar bills than Andrew Jackson the common people would be more likely to have this note than the 50. or the hundred especially back in time when that was like a million dollars this is a one dollar denominational note so what it means is the value to the Federal Reserve of George Washington is a buck you know why I said all that because it's the value of a name where did denominations start from they start from man who puts a lot of emphasis and and and a lot of authority and a lot of respect and so forth on somebody and that somebody can die that don't stop the spirit Martin Luther died and boom the Lutheran Church come up John Wesley died in the Methodist Church come up uh brother Seymour from the Azusa Street Mission died that didn't stop the Pentecostal movement but what is the difference between a denomination and true Eagle Christianity it's based on one man but that one man is not conveying his thoughts he's conveying the thoughts of God and that's what they crucified they thought they could silence God's voice look at the world we live in why do you think there's coming an attack on Christianity because they know Satan knows they have no clue they're just minions they're just being used by Satan to be raised up in a certain thought process to stop Christianity because Christianity is the only hope yeah not denominational Christianity true Eagle Christianity because it emanated from a source they cannot touch right only you and I as believers who are willing to submit and subject ourselves to it have access amen right that's right I'll tell you what I I could I could dance a little bit if I didn't have an artificial knee I'd get crazy but I don't want another one so I'm afraid that I'll I'll have to get another one yeah have you ever seen uh one of them their YouTube videos of them replacing a knee they jump on top of you with a sledgehammer and a chisel and a ranch and they separate the lower leg from the upper one they drill holes in your bone marrow and they take something that looks like a rebar brother Donnie and they glue it down in there the bottom and the top and then they connect this stainless steel ball to it I was in more pain watching than I was participating and sometimes that's the way it is think about it our mind goes to a certain place oh I I can't do it if it's possible let this cup pass from me that was way more painful now you say well no Calvary was in the man it was way more difficult once he became satisfied that that was his portion of of God's work for him he said thy will yeah let thy will be done amen amen but remember something the word God g-o-d and object of worship was brought into existence because before that we are no he was known as what we call Elohim the self-existent one a lot of folks and a lot of churches and a lot of Ministries try to maintain Elohim it's us for nobody that's not the way God operates he says it's me and everybody it's us let us make man you know I'm not going to read it to you but you go a little bit below what is truth and you'll find out that pilate said behold the man that was the man that was produced by Genesis 1 26 and 7. Hallelujah that's right yes God was a thought can you see my thoughts I can't see yours and I can tell by the expression on some of your faces some good something different some bad but I don't know exactly what you're thinking you don't know exactly what I'm thinking so if I want you to understand or be able to comprehend and absorb and digest my thought that you cannot see I must speak now if I'm a liar my thoughts are lies if I'm a sinner my thoughts are sinful but if you've been born again power of transformation begins to what by the renewing of the Mind amen it begins to change somehow it begins to change the way you think now it's not in an instant the way you and I it's a lifetime of change it was Abraham walking for 25 years Abraham by proof of Ishmael had what it took in his body to produce the promise but his church had not quite got there yet amen thank you at what point did Abraham's Church Sarah come to the conclusion that she could fulfill the promise she was changed in such a way or the pharaoh said who who She's mine yeah she hadn't looked in a mirror until she got into Pharaoh's Palace because they had mirrors you know and she looked and said whoa who is that this is the person that he wants for his wife Abraham get me out of here I've got what it takes now to produce the promised son and God intervened don't touch her because if you even try you die God see is always he's in I like I I sister Regina I bet you could sing this for me he's an on time God yes he is he's an on-time God yes he is job said it might not be rare when you want him to but he's always right on time because he's an on-time God that's why we're here this morning did you realize that you are fulfilling the on time God so he as a thought as a spirit as the great mind we call him because we don't really know how else to express or explain it he began to speak and he said let there be and let there be and let there be now guess what the spoken word really is it is his son see we think of the human body as his son but if you'll go to First the Epistle of First John 5 what does it say there first John 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now in verse 14 it says and the Word was made flesh so they thought they were crucifying the word Satan was motivating them to stop God come on you ain't gonna stop God you ain't gonna stop God's word but the carrier the conduit the vehicle the one that God chose the conduit he chose in the 20th century was killed in a car accident Satan said I stopped on Calvary I stopped it he didn't stop nothing he just motivated he didn't realize that he just motivated he inspired here's what he did watch as I mentioned to you about Levi being activated in the loins of Abraham when that car accident took place what Satan didn't know was there was an activation of Life why because a corn of wheat abideth alone unless it falls into the ground it dies and if it dies and there is life in it it will bring forth after it's kind of oh I see I got a little Kickback right there oh well he's trying to be the prophet oh no I'm not trying to be the prophet I'm not trying to be Jesus Christ he lives in here I'll tell you what we are did you hear me say it yesterday we are the burning bush did you realize that and as the fire of God Burns in your heart perhaps there will be a Moses out there somewhere that will turn aside and say what do you got who did you say you were what do you believe I believe he's an on-time God I believe he's good all the time I believe he saves by grace listen now here's the part they leave out through faith that's not the end of that scripture you are saved by grace through faith you must have a revelation of what the grace of God truly is and the grace of God is unmerited favor how did we end up then brother Louise in the condition of Salvation if it was unmerited favor in our neighbor who's ten times better than we are doesn't it it's because of foreknowledge see four knowledge is still here that's why it's looking forward that sees the past not looking back brother bread instead of frog looks back man and when a frog looks back he sees a try in being when a child of God looks forward they see God you know I believe this now it's not a Doctrine it's just the way I feel that this new telescope the James Webb super telescope is sent out there one million miles one million miles out in space and it's static and it's sending out and it's receiving and it's taking pictures it's looking around what are they looking for if you'll read and Christ is revealed in his own word right where brother Brandon mentions Einstein on the next page he says now they they they're going to take and they're going to look out there and they think they're looking 100 million light years or so out there he says that they're going to find out they're just looking at the backs of them but that's what the mechanical eye that took the picture of the pillar of fire but the pillar of fire itself is the life not the picture so what God wants you and I to do is become the activated germ seed of God to produce his word in its season and the season right now is Rapture and Rapture has requirements it requires a change of the body now those people that have gone on before us are waiting for the resurrection what I want the bride of Christ to realize today through the preaching of the word of God and the quoting of it and the understanding and revelation of it is the resurrection lays in you if you are an in time on time seed of God and they are and they are rooting for you because they without us cannot be made perfect oh when they went beyond the curtain of time they they seemed like they was perfect oh no they was lacking something they didn't eat they didn't drink they didn't get tired brother Randolph said they didn't have the feeling that you and I have he hugged them sisters in it no there was no sensation but when the Son and Daughter of God hug each other it's like yeah you know what I mean yeah yeah don't you fellas be hugging no ladies now except your wife don't get the wrong idea but you understand when I when I hug a brother it's like yeah doesn't it feel we got this yeah and then three brothers get together and pray in the room we got this and then Six Brothers get together and hold hands and begin we got this what a fellowship what a joy divine leaning on the Everlasting Arms what a blessed peace what a joy is mine amen amen you want to finish it went from the thought of God in the beginning was the word now listen I want you to go to the the the if you care to to First John that's the Epistles of John just previous to the Book of Revelation you all know these scriptures but I just want to put the puzzle together today so that those of you who have not seen this picture before can go hmm I better sit down and consider this I mean maybe we ought to look a little deeper into this first John 5 verse 7. says for there are three that bear record in heaven the father watch now the word so there's where we know that the word is the Sun and it's the s-o-n by by the characteristic of a spirit that can't be seen which is the father investing itself into an entity that can be tangible that's the word and then the Holy Ghost most people don't realize is the author of the word so the Holy Ghost watch now authored the son yeah what is the Holy Ghost it's the office of God whereby he is not fulfilling the invisible spirit and he is not indwelling in the word he is himself think about it okay I am a Trion being you're a try and being I am a father because I have children I am a son because I have a father and I'm me the me part in type is the Holy Ghost why would people be afraid of the Holy Ghost it's because they've been taught through psychology and education and Academia that you could be somebody else yeah but God's word teaches you who you really are and and and in closing that's what the world is trying to crucify they're not crucifying Jesus Christ again they're crucifying the Son of God in the form of the word they want to stop that word why why does Satan want to stop that word why did they try to kill why did Cain kill Abel why did they try to kill the children the days of Moses why did they try to kill the children in the days of Jesus why are they killing children today it's because Satan is trying to stop that Lassie he was trying to stop the Original Seed Jesus Christ came busted down the door and said I'm him give me those keys you're done yeah amen well what Satan didn't know is 2 000 plus years we're going to have to go by so that God's plan could fulfill itself not just in the Sun but in his bride and we were in him that's why in the image of God these two shall be one both male and female so they're really trying to crucify watch now watch the world in his Spirit watch how they're trying to attract the children born or Unborn through the woman because Satan reads the prophecy in Genesis and says it's a woman's seed I'm gonna stop the woman's seed dummy I'll tell you right now Fred Sanford said you a dummy my wife squinting don't don't before I was saved I grew up in front of a television that's right I'll tell you what my first message I ever preached was called Rock of Ages I come out of rock and roll brother Donnie and I could see the inspiration I'm telling you the inspiration of God on gifted men who went astray in my generation it was John Lennon gifted wrote music that got millions of people to be drawn in with simple phrases rather like she loves you yeah yeah yeah help I need somebody see that was that was where gifts being misused [Music] for the wrong Glory why wouldn't we be willing to accept the gifts that God would use for his glory all right I believe I heard them before service up here sing it and worshiping but the hardest thing for God to do did you know there was something hard for God no brother no nothing so but the hardest thing nothing's too hard for God but the hardest thing for God to do is to get one mortal man to believe another because you're all sitting down there going you guys know better than me no I'm not I'm Chief pastoral I'm I'm the guy under Paul Paul said he's chiefest I can't take anything away from Paul yeah right brother Branham said he taught what Paul taught there shouldn't be any question when you read something Paul said that said no well brother Branham changed it over he didn't change nothing he magnified many things because that's what we're doing today we're not changing the gold into silver we're just polishing the gold so you could see your reflection in it the James Webb super telescopes mirrors are made out of gold the most reflective and conductive item we know of oh what a conductor what a reflection and here's the beautiful thing brother Donnie about God's word and us as his children when we look into the gold of God's mirror we don't see ourselves but like Sarah looking in Pharaoh's mirror we see a change individuals I'm not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but I surely hate what I used to be but at some point that saying now that saying is gonna come to an end in the days of ananias and Sapphira there will only be one kind of believer in the church now there's three kinds but at some point in time there will only be and and they might be just dragging themselves like carrying the cross and sometimes they need a little help yep Jesus need a little help carrying his cross they just couldn't his physical body just couldn't make it he just he was 120 pounds probably by the time he got to Calgary 110 it collapsed but he's an on-time God Simon how could yeah he didn't think he didn't consider the consequences he knew the Romans were kicking and scourging and mocking and beating and and stabbing and pushing and shoving the people out of the way didn't stop Simon God is good in closing it went from a thought to a word which is the Sun and now it has become manifest In the Flesh they couldn't they couldn't crucify the word they could only pervert it they could not stop God they could not kill a spirit they cannot see or touch so they picked on the vehicle David don't feel bad when you picked on yeah yeah we carried the cross of the world on his shoulders and he rose from the dead we all know that the world's but what I want you to receive this morning as the resurrected crisis in the building he's in the buildings and he's bringing together a mystical body which is the body of Christ as I heard brother Louise say and he's the head and if the head Rises the body Rises with it can these Dry Bones live guarantee please stand man I did all that without even reading this quote that I want to read to you now here's the deal it's a long quote so I'm gonna give you where I got it from if that's okay and then you can read it yourself but I'll start at a paragraph 46. now notice he says the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that's why I picked the three subjects that Jesus is raised up from the dead he's not dead he's a living when it looked like he was in the Tomb on Saturday which was the seven day God sent a messenger to the seventh Church age that began to prove to show and to tell that he was raised from the dead and his name was William Marion Branham we do not believe he was God we believe he was of thy servants our fellow brothers but he was so close that John decided he might try to Bow Down and Worship Him in the Book of Revelations don't do it right right there's a quote and I believe it's in the Patmos Vision where brother Brown said they kick and knock you around today but he said someday they'll bow down at your feet and worship you know we're not looking for worship we don't want self-worship we don't want self-satisfaction but we want is is a living God Jesus is raised up from the dead he's not dead he's a living he lives here he's in us I'll be with you even in you a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you under the end of the world now as Christians we all claim he is alive or we've been quickened from life from Death To Life by his spirit and if he haven't been quickened if we haven't been quick and then we've not been made alive that's why we say stay with the word stay with the word stay with the word because it is what is going to be quickened but don't you dare deny the spirit of God when it begins to rain down upon that seed now it rains upon the just and the unjust we can't help it if people go nuts we can't help it if they act crazy we can't help it if they don't have this seed in them but the water is watering what's in them that's the anointed ones at the end time it's the true anointing it's the true Reign but what it falls on is what's going to make the difference and Let Me Tell You Folks something when the seed of God through the word of God is living in you which is the Son of God and the spirit comes down it will race amen Christ from the dead did you realize we're apart sorry everybody's already standing nope let's pray Heavenly Father Lord yes we could continue to preach Lord for well for eons there's no stopping point Lord in you you who have no beginning and has no end Lord where are we where are we going to find it a place to stop when what you have informed us of Lord through the preaching of the word through the delivery of the word and through the spirit falling on that word Lord that now we've come to that final office three [Music] perfection foreign it's the day of the Holy Ghost Lord we can't take the father and the son out because those were offices that the Holy Ghost itself filled which only can mean Lord that the Holy Ghost is the spirit that we called Elohim no beginning no end and father we use the word self-existent one because we don't understand what it means Lord not to be in a beginning Lord we began we we believe we began Lord but the word of God through the presence of God through the spirit of God had no beginning you were speaking to your attributes Lord before there was even a molecule to live in but how Lord it had to be through the agency of your thoughts that's why they thought the prophet of God was a mind reader but he wasn't Lord he was being used by you and your foreknowledge [Music] to go through the land and cry out [Music] to the rocks which became seeds which came forth and began to produce the results Lord that you desired to see before anybody could see anything I pray you'd help us this morning Lord to recognize that the resurrection that happened two thousand years ago or so Lord [Music] exists amongst us today in the hearts of your children Lord so difficult for us to comprehend father where it came from Nicodemus Lord had no idea that when Jesus said the wind comes and it goes where it wants to and you have no idea where it comes from that he was referring to a life and it's without question here this morning Lord that you have revealed yourself to us and the broadest sense Lord you've given us so much more than they've had in the past Lord it's the information age father because the information is available but it's not to be dissected Lord through the intellect is to be received in the heart because you said as we receive the word we become the word I pray father for each and every one and here this morning if there's one sick person Lord the Holy Spirit right now the healing virtue that in the beginning knew it was a Healer father that great Holy Spirit I pray now Lord that it would touch everybody Lord hear or within the sound of our voice father anyone that's in need father of any kind lord of the being tormented if they're oppressed or depressed Lord if they're not sure who they are this morning Father Make Them sure Lord I pray let it be firm in their soul because we just want to give you the honor and the glory and the praise in the precious name the name given above every name the name that was concluded to be both Lord and Christ the name of Jesus Lord this morning I pray father for your honor and your glory in Jesus name amen go ahead brother Luis God bless you happy Easter he is risen [Music] this glorious day there's never been a day [Music] like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's never been alive [Music] [Applause] there's never been a day folks never been a day like today like this day to me there has never been [Applause] this day I sing [Applause] [Music] rise [Music] now look at the advancement of man we talk about light I know when Dad was growing up and some of your older ones was growing up it was a little candle and he talks about doing his homework over we always call them a hurricane lamp it's just a little lamp with some kerosene in it it's got a little Wick in it and you got to do your you got to do your your class lessons right there at it because but it was light it was light then a little bit a little bit longer there was a bulb gave a little bit more life I know bro George remembers and we just go in those little houses and there'd be one light bulb hanging down and you couldn't see nothing 10 feet past that bulb well now we have LED light that one little bitty pen light or a laser light or locked a whole place up well I hope that we know one thing's for sure the same way with God we could only see him by candlelight but there was way more of him to see then there was a light bulb came on hello somebody that was a light bulb came on you got to see a little bit more now you get to see him in LED you get to see him in the lights you've never seen him before and I hope when that light turns on you see Jesus Christ first but you're going to see him in your brother and your sister you're going to see him as as you most of you know that go to church here I've been doing a series on the Statue of perfect man part 99 what we read that scripture in John 1 in the beginning was the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh most people most people line goes back to 2000 years ago to that man yeah it started with that man but the words were being made flesh today in me and you that word that you took in today is going into your flesh and then your flesh is going to be motivated by what's inside you're either going to do right or you're going to do wrongness whatever the motivating factor is so but good to have you each and every one of you here that let's give brother Chris

feet thank you all for coming thank you for pouring your heart out each and every one of you that sang preached and just walked through the door there's a lot of people didn't get up this morning right there's a lot of people millions of people in this 8 billion uh person world never saw the sun come up but I hope they saw the sun come up inside of them before the real sun came up that's what I asked you today don't let the sun don't let the natural sun go down on you till you know that the spiritual part the son the Son of God dwells in your heart because we're not guaranteed a day a breath a moment so this Easter Sunday reflect on one thing there had to be a death before there could be life and thank God for that you know it would be good to to to to give you life for your kids or I give my life for brother Chris but you know what there's no there's nothing inside of me that's good enough that when I did die I could go into Chris and make him better one man can do that only one only one man had that kind of spirit inside of him that's what he's talking about Adam Adam thought he could save Eve well he didn't save her like that because he wasn't her savior he was the son of God he could cover he could protect her but he didn't save her there was only one savior one man the Lord Jesus Christ died for your sins being God Almighty and the human flesh he put that flesh aside but guess what he rose at the third day he came back out of that grave to do one thing go inside of his people and as brother Chris said to birth himself into his children as only one man can do that and that's the Lord Jesus Christ and he's eternal and if we connect ourselves to that as old brother Ernie Villanueva Lord bless his soul may he rest he said we plugged ourselves into the eternal we got unplugged in the garden but we now by the new birth we got ourselves plugged back into that Eternal strand that Eternal court and that's what we live off of we live off of that power of his resurrection that we can have a resurrection the Bible tells us into newness of Life as we do in the baptismal service we resurrect in newness of life I pray that your life from now on will be new and that you'll think more about the Lord pray more study more have more of a fervor because I was telling them the other day brother Chris you people think we're strange and we isolate ourselves we don't we just speak a different language if I went to you know if I went to China I'm not I'm not Chinese I don't speak I could learn it but I wouldn't learn it fluently as the person that spoke it from birth hello somebody spoke it from birth through birth we realize that we speak a different language amen so we're speaking a different language now than the world speaks a different thought process that's why they didn't like Jesus and why I didn't like the disciples it's because they were different but they were made different by what was inside of them and I was telling the other day brother Chris if you took 20 people out in the world just brought 20 people off the street set them in here today and let them listen to your sermon or any sermon with with Enlightenment or more light they'd think you're crazy what do you mean talking about a seed and talking about this and talking about that they just don't speak our language but I pray to God that that language will be so simple though that you'll be able to understand it the Common People heard his message gladly the Common People the dollar bill people not the fifty dollar bill people the dollar bill people hurt him gladly so good to be here today thank you all for coming thank you for giving up your time to be here this weekend for the three days that we had Friday Saturday and Sunday the only thing we got brother Dale's

off and let God's show to this world that he's still alive he's still alive in his people the spiral heads Lord thank you for this day you've given us thank you for the time that we've had Lord to listen to the word of God being brought by soldiers of God that Lord knows what they're talking about Lord through you as as Chris was talking about we're the only ones that truly know your mind because we went back in there with brother Branham we went back in the back part of your mind and now this is unfolding exactly what you wanted to see had there not been a fall Sons and Daughters of God worshiping you and listening to your word father and let it be made manifest in each one of us Lord there's some that come from uh long distances we pray that you just be with them Lord as they travel back home but your brother Chris and sister Joanna Lord as they continue on Lord and head home there about Thursday we pray that you'd be with them Lord be with each one that's here Lord under the sound of our voice that they'll reflect on what happened this weekend Lord and it'd be not just another service or another calendar day or another another holiday or even a holy day Lord every day should be a resurrection every day should be a day that we take up our cross and follow you Lord I pray that you'd bless each one Lord take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit as we come back together Lord on Wednesday night and the ones that are in different fellowships to where they're going to be Lord I pray that you'd be with each one in Jesus name we ask these things amen oh
