before we could think another thought we'd have to say oh Jesus be merciful to us Lord we ask for your forgiveness of all of our shortcomings our mistakes and things that would be held against us but

and our transgressions with a dark cloud and father We Just Praise You For It Lord that we can stand and come boldly Lord into the Throne of mercy and there make our petitions known Lord we love you now bless the remainder of this service as we commit it to you in jesus' name amen God bless you friends if you have your Bibles we wouldd like for you to look into the The Song of Solomon and while you're looking for that it's there just in front of Isaiah if you have a hard time finding those little books in the Bible that'll be an easy way to find it and uh am I needing some no duct tape I hated it so take it out of you can't fix it huh I've been stripped no no no we got plenty microphone all right thank you here we go all right Song of Solomon everybody found it amen amen and we're going to read out of chapter three there starting at the first verse it says By Night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth I sought him but I found him not I will rise now and go about this city in the streets and in the Broadways and I will seek him whom my soul loveth I sought him but I found him not the Watchmen that go about the city found me to whom I said saw you him whom my soul loveth and it was but a little while that I passed from them but I found him whom my soul loveth I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him unto my mother's house and into the Chamber of her that had conceive me may the Lord bless the reading of the word this evening as you have your seats we would like to take a little time this evening just preach a little from my heart I amen was reading in a uh commentary of Charles Spurgeon and he made a note concerning this and just the way that he approached it I I I said you know that that's just highly preach material brother d i I believe you know that that there's a a great lesson to be learned here but as I studied on with the commentators of the the great uh man age under that man anointing I I I saw that they could only approach it uh to a point but then there there came this great void of understanding there came this the this place because we understand according to the message of the hour that there's there's only one provided place of Fellowship that we have under the under the revealed word of the hour and that that that that God has a place for us and that that that here was a a a woman this this this shulamite woman was a was a type of Christ and a a type of the Bride here and Solomon being a type of Christ and and as I was as I was looking at this we could see and look back into the days when when there was a time that that Israel fulfilled these very scriptures and and how that Israel would would would backslide and how that they would that they would get out of fellowship with God and and how that that that God would be removed from them and they would go seeking after God in all the wrong places right as I thought about that I I said you know history always repeats itself and and we know how that you know that that that man is just a a a habitual Sinner and just a creature of habit and and we just do the same things over and over again and we follow saw how that Israel would do the same thing that would that God would send him a deliver and and he would take them out and and and and set them up and put them back into fellowship and all they would say We'll serve the Lord and we'll do all these things and God let this Stone be a witness against it wouldn't be 72 hours and they'd be backslid as of goose and you wonder how in the world could they do those things when when God had done so much for them and then we carry it on down and we see that things don't change much you know people are still very much the same and though we can say well you know we've got a we've got a Holy Ghost in This Hour we got a but we're still people we're still born of a woman we still got inherent weaknesses that are hardwired into you just like they're hardwired into me and we still have a tendency to fall on our face and and we we we even with the Holy Ghost friends I I'm here to tell you people make some of the most rational decisions and mistakes in their life and we we just seem to but here we see this woman and the scripture says that it was by night and so we see here that it was a dark time that it was a that it was a time where uh you know it was it was a a confused hour that she was in you ever wake up in the night and and wonder I I don't know which way I'm laying in the bed and and you know you you you turn one way you're all to fall out but yeah you turn the other way and you mind you don't know and you you find yourself in a in a confused State there and so we see that this was a a dark time it was a night time and so she says well I I said to myself where is he that my soul loveth where is he the one that my soul loveth and and she began to look for him in the bedroom and in the places where she thought he ought to be you know ought have been there uh she she that's the first place she looked and then she said well he's not here so I must go into the into the city I got to go out into the streets and into the Broadways and and we find that as she went looking for him he wasn't nowhere to be found yeah right yeah right but I asked the question this evening why wasn't he found yeah right she you would have thought she would have been the one to know where he was this one that are soul loved but we find that the scripture here shows us that that she went in all the wrong places oh yeah that's right we we realize that Christ spirit is a is a a a dove Spirit a Meek spirit it's a lamb nature and it has these the this is the way that Christ wasn't and Christ the word the the the the Holy Spirit it doesn't go out and mingle with a bunch of confusion amen right you're not going to find Christ Spirit uh and all this this loud stuff that they that they got going on in the streets and and and carrying on in the Broadway why just the very fact that she would call it the Broadway would tell you that Christ wasn't going to be there when would Christ ever be on Broadway amen you see or Hollywood right where Christ would never be in those places and Solomon here was a was the mystery of Jehovah revealed you see he was a type of the brid a type of the husband the type of the king the type of the Lord and here this woman was a shite she was a type of The Virtuous bride and here she was looking for him but she was looking in all the wrong places we find that people get so confused many times they think that he's in a big church or in a big denomination or in a big system somewhere oh a big program a big education a big politics a big government God ain't never in those places he ain't never revealed his he always reveals himself in Simplicity that's right brother right amen here was this woman looking lost the company of Christ can you imagine out of Fellowship any time that we leave the word we leave Christ right that's right any time we walk away from the revealed word of God we walk away from Christ in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word word became flesh so we see that the son of man is the re revelation of the word for the hour that we live in it's the word made flesh again amen that's right and so we find that I like how Spurgeon says this you tell me where you lost the company of Christ and I will tell you the most likely place to find it right we found that that that soldier who had been out on the battlefield and he was he was cut through with a machine gun I believe it was or strael or something like that he was laying there on the ground bleeding out and and there the the chaplain came to him and and said Son are you a Christian do you know God he said well I once knew him he said well when did you he said you do you know him now son you're fixing to go and meet your maker you're fixing the face almighty God how do you know him now what's your condition now I said well I don't know he said well where did you know him yeah said you got to go back to where you knew him that's the place you've got to find Christ is go back where you last felt him the last place you knew him you got to go back there and that condition oh that boy began to pray now I'll lay me down to sleep am he had a cradle religion oh man he had KN known God and the and the and in the nursery oh I want to God that people amen would Shake themselves and wonder have you ever known Christ outside of the nursery outside of your Sunday school experience when the last time you had fellowship with Christ a real experience with God right where did you lose him did you lose him in the closet yeah in your prayer closet oh my and when's the last time you visited him there yeah when's the last time we had a an hour of restraining prayer Amen in a time where we supplicated with God we call ourselves the Church of the Living God and we have no fellowship with Christ oh but we have plenty of fellowship with the sports stadium and plenty of Fellowship over here with the movie house and all kinds of Fellowship here and there oh let me tell you what Fellowship has Christ with below what Fellowship has with Darkness amen oh you got to find him in that place of pleading prayer that's where you'll find him if that's where you left him right did you lose Christ by sin yeah that's some besetting sin some little stubborn thing that you won't repent of and you know God's convicted you over and over and over and over and over again you still keep coming back to the the same place and the same conviction and the same condemnation in your soul oh let me tell you amen the pl the one that your soul loveth that's the one that's lost many times our you know we find that we're a Triune being we we're a body we're a spirit and we're a soul and we find that many times I I'm friend your your your flesh never did love God oh my my Bible says you were an alien you were born in sin shaped in iniquity that you uh you were dead in trespasses and sins and in times past walked according to the course of this world according to the prince and the power of the Earth the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience that was your flesh that's your flesh and your flesh unchecked and un unrestrained by God Amen it'll lead you right straight back into the water where you come out of amen that's right but the scripture also says among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our minds your spirit man right you see and so that Spirit man it don't love God either never did love God always captivated by its imagination by its memory by its conscience and by its affections amen why it was it was always captivated by those things that were around him because the things that were around him had ACC to those there was doors through the flesh there was doors through the spirit but the scripture says the one that my soul love it oh let me tell you amen there was an election that was laying there there was a little woman amen by the well and she she was an outcast of society married four times or five times and living with another and no fellowship with God but Jesus said I have needs to go by way of Samaria why because there was a little woman there that had something on the inside of her soul amen that God could identify with we find then that when Christ be to call oh from the from the regions of the Lost amen that little woman amen when Christ was standing there oh that little that seed germ amen that was down inside her it began to bring that Spirit woman it began to bring that flesh woman under subjection to that Soul woman oh let me tell you this what we need tonight is as a as our soul to fall in love with Christ again and it'll bring all the rest of you into subjection to the word that's right did you lose Christ by neglecting the scriptures we find so many times that people you know you start out serving God and you read the scriptures every day and every night it's it's ever on your mind study the word listen to a tape study the word go to church hear the preaching oh but then after a little while so many things begin to take the place oh don't you realize that's the words of your lover that's the words of the one that your soul loveth oh my can you imagine a relationship where the husband he would just you know he would just come in maybe you know uh in the evening sit down pick up his newspaper drink his tea or his coffee or whatever to have a little dinner go to bed wake up the next morning go to work go on about his way life she gets up she goes through her routine and the only ships passing in the night they only see once another talk to one another you know on occasional B why that relationship would fall apart in just a matter of months amen exactly they go on and on and on like that until finally they wonder and the kids are grown and the kids are raised and they're moved out of the house and then a man and a woman now they got the empty nest and they look at each other they don't even they don't even know each other right that's right oh why is it how how would that be your relationship would that be a a synopsis of your relationship with Christ that you were just ships passing in the night you saw him at church amen you heard him on a t you just passed by and me you didn't pay a whole lot of attention in there had no real relationship with Christ he couldn't move on your soul and cause you to to weep and to and to come into some sort of a a spiritual relationship where he meant more to you than life or breath or your necessary food oh would Christ ever come to a place like that in a man's life why you would seek Him day and night he would long for him in the night would search for him everywhere he could wouldn't be satisfied until he found him amen oh that I knew where I might find him oh it's dangerous to be without the lord it's dangerous oh it be like sheep without Shepherd it' be like like a tree without water oh let me tell you friends we need Christ this evening amen then I thought something here that the scripture says that she was going out into the City and looking everywhere then the Bible says that she says but the Watchman yeah the Watchman amen that went about the city found me yeah she wasn't looking for them right but they found her oh yeah now I thought this was striking and so once they found her then she thought well these are some Authority these are some kind of a you know some sort of an office that I maybe I could make a request to and she says have you seen the one that my soul loveth and then we see a like a breach in the scripture we see like a like a like there's like a Vortex or a void now in the word that there's no other communication between them and then we just find her the next thing we know that she's embracing the one that she loved yeah and you begin to wonder what happened here what happened they found her then she found him yeah something something happened there you know and and as I so I said well then surely these Great Men of God and so I went back through the commentary page after page of of reference to this very passage of scripture and they all said well she was having a dream and she didn't know where she was it's is all an allegory that one one commentator even said that that many people believe that the Song of Solomon was just erotic songs that Solomon wrote to his many women yeah had no spiritual bearing at all and then others said well they they found her and they they just thought she was deranged and that she didn't know what she was looking for and they didn't know who she was looking for anyways and and oh my and they just went on and on and on and on and I thought what how is it that you could see something in the scripture uh uh like a Watchman on the wall and not and be a theologian and not be able to reference the word amen back into the prophetic utterances of Isaiah where Isaiah amen references this scripture of the Watchman it says Watchman what of the night oh my how they could not see that this Watchman was significant in the scripture and that this Watchman that he bore a reference throughout Bible type and Bible example amen they Carri it from Genesis to Revelation you see every time that God had to get through to his people that he set a person a single messenger up above the others and to point the people in the right direction oh my how they could not see that and I thought my that's just so obvious in the scripture why why wouldn't they see that why couldn't they see that this Watchman now then here it uses a plural reference did you notice that Watchmen and so I have to I have to say that that is that was not done by accident but that had to be done on purpose that God Amen that though there would be a singular Watchman even in the milit we had what we call the Corporal of the Guard or the sergeant of the Guard or the officer of the Guard there was there was one that was over the rest of the guards right and they operated under that set of instructions and that's what they did they had a certain route that they had to take a beat that they had to walk I've walked many a cold night amen guarding nothing but a bunch of empty empty old damn tracks amen freezing myself to death out there wonder why would anybody want to steal this bunch of junk but it was my job I didn't have to I couldn't go there and say Hey Sergeant guard I don't want to watch this stuff it's cold out there it's Christmas Eve and this is a bunch of broken down am tras who's going to steal an Amtrak right I couldn't ask that question wasn't my job to ask that question I had a post I had to be there and I was I was I was ordered to be there oh let me tell you friends that there's a there's a five-fold Ministry amen that God has Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers Amen to perfect the Saints Amen to walk in the word amen to stay under the ERS amen are their Chief Watchman that's right that's right and so but I saw here why did they not why didn't I why couldn't they see that it's obvious to me that that Watchman showed her where he was am it's obvious to me but they all said nothing the scripture is is silent there and I thought wasn't that something then my mind began to go back and I thought hey that that's another place in the Bible that does that over in the seals when the seals are being brought forth and you get to the Sixth Seal it ends up in the sixth chapter of Revelations but then we have this this this it's like a an injection of a whole another chapter of the Bible the whole seven chapter is dropped in there and then you go over to chapter eight and it picks up the seventh seal right and it says it talks about a a half hour silence and things but we find that under the half hour silence that was really the revelation of that was really over in chapter 7 come on right because it was over in chapter 7 that we have a prophet to the Gentiles it's over in chapter 7 that we have those Messengers go back to the church of Israel we find all these things happened in that seventh chapter but yet between the sixth and the and the and the seventh seal there's this whole message that's delivered inside of there and what was it but it was to point the people back to Christ the lover of their souls amen that's right now then the the the the system missed it yeah sure well they just let her wander they just let her wand oh those watch when the the Bible talks about those pastors he said that they don't feed their their Church they don't feed the children they're they're they're Wicked they don't do those thingsbody said there's going to be some pastors that will feed their people there's going to be some pastors that'll take care of the flock of God that's right but there was these ones that didn't what did they do they let her go off out into predition again led the blind the blind leading the blind oh but my here was this one that these Messengers that told this little woman here he is the one that you're so loving he's the one where is he not on the highway he's not in the big system he's not in the big organization but he's here hidden in the word amen brought him over to the revealed word of the hour said this is the one that your soul loveth that's right he says but watch prophet of God picks up those those uh the Magi the wise men he said we have seen his star in the east right right now then so here they come and they present this as some Christmas Story oh my and they' got these Magi looking into the Eastern sky right that's not even the way that it happened they were in the East looking to the West right that's how they saw the star and so but you you find here that they were reading the scripture and they saw in the Bible that a star would rise out of Judah and they begin looking for that star now we realize that that star that they saw it passed by every observatory in the country right nobody saw it but an elected group right only those three saw they went rocking right by staring right we following the star what star yeah everybody else said what star what are you looking at where did it go we haven't seen it yeah and the prophet of God said they didn't see it because they were not looking for it they weren't looking for it Oh my he says that's how we can come in these churches Heen we we see the supernatural happen all around it we didn't see anything yeah yeah come on weren't looking for it that's right that's right watch I like this he says these Holiness people whatever you want to call yourself he says I don't see nothing because you're not looking for it oh but you usually get what you're looking for that's right it's right you you get what you're looking for now then just want to recap just for a second here hit some of these I thought the wording here is very good he says and it's between the sixth and the seventh seal that this interval is given now we want to notice this very important that we notice this little time right it was just a little time based you know in comparison to the whole grand scheme of things the the message of the hour the the unfolding of the seals the the the the the the the the breaking forth of the Mysteries and all even brother Ram's entire Ministry was actually very small space of time on the grand scheme of things but it was a time there where there was a Watchman that could deliver a message now then when he delivered a message then he says now there's going to be men that will pick this message up and will carry them out to the Rapture right yeah oh my what was it but it was to carry this little woman this little virtuous woman and was going to carry her in a way that was would be pleasing to God and would carry her into the presence of the one that her soul lth watch so between the sixth and seventh trumpet there's a prophet who appeared before the Gentiles to call the people back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine you see so the the things that were restored are were just that restored they're not new this is not a new doctrine it's not a new movement it's not anything new but this is a restoring back to the original and I want you to see something here he says it's between the seventh Angel's message that has been preaching and condemning the Pentecostals you see why because they denominated went out into the Broadways went out into big organization and colleges and hospitals and huge uh uh building programs of multi-million and billion dollar or ganizations and got their mind off of Christ and got their mind on to their own systems that's right that's where they deviated you see right amen but watch this message of the Watchman would condemn those things oh yeah sure condemn it yep that's right wouldn't have nothing to do with it but when he would when when he would do that then the system because that's what people inherently want they wanted the Tower of Babel oh yeah they wanted the the masses in the days of Noah they wanted the the the the pleasures of Egypt in the days of Moses we found that people continually rebelled against God and condemned Moses and LOE the light bread which was the very thing that God was sending them to express his love to them right that's why he sent the serpents among them absolutely amen complained about food yeah that's right I always said you complain about the food at my house you're going to get a wheel knot oh my that's right it's a knot on your head that will not go down that's right cuz I know that everything that comes across that am man that counter over on my my table it's made with hands amen that are Holy Ghost hands that are that's pure unadulterated love amen and concern for the people that are eating it amen it's not just some you know microwave dinner that you pop out of the oven and throw down in front say eat that oh that wouldn't that wouldn't that you'll kill yourself eating that stuff oh but my when it's been hand cooked and homecooked and oh carried out there with a with a heart of love for the people well that it wouldn't matter if it had syrup running off of it it'd be good for you amen that's right amen amen uh cherry pie with you know that uh what how he say it uh uh cast slobers on it you know whipped cream and and molasses poured on top of it there you go feel made by Christian hands that still be good for you I believe pray for it say Lord turn this into cabbage going down you amen oh don't you love him but now I'm bringing you to something here that here was this messenger that we have to it has to line up with the scripture right if it doesn't line up with the scripture then it's not a true Watchman because that Watchman could not be M sighted he couldn't be half blind with a patch on one eye he had to have a man that was had eyesight not only that but he had to have a thorough understanding of the stars of the heavens because his job was to look into the stars of the heaven and he would see that all right or Orion is in it I don't know anything about these things I'm just giving you an example would say it's in this third phase or in this fourth phase and that'd be in the fall of the year you know Ryan the hunter that's why we hunt the time of that's where the animals are are you know it's good to kill them at that time of the year because they don't have young with them and stuff and and and there coming on winter time and the the weak are going to die anyways so it's a it's a natural thing and so here uh here was O was coming into his position he know it'd be dropping over into the sunset you into the into the into the west and and so but if you didn't know what oion look like then you wouldn't know where oion was and so you I'm just using him as an example and and and so here here this Watchman you know some weary Christian would come out of his house in the middle of the night he couldn't sleep and oh just burden down he say what what of the night well if it you know if it was one or two in the morning he' say well we see Orion's high in the skies probably around you know 1 2 in the morning something like that there was there wasn't really a clock then they they would just tell me is in the you know be the first watch or the second watch or whatever it would be and he' say oh my oh I got to go back to bed and so he'd stagger back in there and you he' try to go maybe go have some warm milk or something eat him some onions or something go to sleep you know and so it would he would try to try to get himself you say why you eat onions onions help you go to sleep you know that yeah they have opium in them there like an opiate in there helps you it's like a narcotic put you to sleep turkey will do that dark dark meat turkey will do that too yeah they get you an onion turkey sandwich sleep like a baby won't get No Interruption your breath will smell like a goat by the way there you go yeah that's right and so hey but what be asking that Washman what hour is it and that's what we find that people you know I I heard someone here the other day say it was talking about um it was on a it was on a a web thing it was they were given the exact time and exact date of the coming of the Lord oh my it was going to be May the 14th of uh I maybe it might have been this year or something like that oh my and what if he don't come at that hour what credibility will that Watchman have oh my my Watchman said look up look up your day Redemption is here friends amen Redemption is here upon us it's not something we look off out into the future I'm not looking in two weeks I'm not looking in two years Heen he could come before the night is over say Watchman what of the night if he's a true Watchman and he'll tell you what to look for right man what to see now watch because he's he knows about those things he'll see the historic evidences of Christ and where that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 he'll see those things he'll point you to those things he'll point you to True Bible uh doctrines of of of the ordinances of the of the of the Bible of water baptism the Lord's Supper of foot washing he'll tell you these things correctly according to the word of God he'll point you to to to the right things of the of the word of God in your domestic affairs of marriage and divorce he'll point you to those things he'll tell you amen where the where the security of the believer is he'll tell you those things that's right because because he's a true Watchman of the word not only that but this Watchman also would know the enemy in the daytime those watch them would stand on the on there and they would look out uh through primitive means through the little little Optics that they had and they would look out on the horizon and if they see the standards or the insides of these different armies that were approaching then they would say oh well that's that's Judah coming over to visit Benjamin well that's our buddy let's open the doors make them welcome kill a fatted calf where you we're going to have a party that's a it's a great time a Great Fellowship we're going to we're going to give these uh soldiers of a of our Brethren we're going to give them meat but if he looked out across there and he'd say hey that looks like them's Philistine banners them's Philistine banners he say board up this place let's put put soldiers out on the walls let's defend ourselves is that right would have to be well knowledged in the enemy's tactics he would be able to see the movements he'd be able to call it back down to the armies what to prepare themselves for right so we'd have to have long Vision be able to see it amen right I appreciate God sending a a a Watchman in our day amen I do because he was able to look out from 1932 and give us specifics that we could look for and we could we could actually we could actually Bank on those things mean that that we would not be that that we wouldn't be concerned or we wouldn't be confused as to whether or not that this was the right thing or not and that God would stand behind it and vindicate that message that's right but not only that but the people that would respect that message that there would be a provision made right yeah the Bible tells us that if the Watchman warned the people MH and the people prepare that the blood if they if they lose the battle that the blood would not be on the watchman's hands but it would be on the people's hands because they did not prepare or for whatever reason they lost the battle you know just never there's all kinds of uh variables there but the the Watchman did his job that was the main thing he said but if he saw the enemy did not warn the people said then the blood would be upon his hands right all right so now that's very important because we see then that this Watchman begin to tell the people what to look for amen right that's right we find that the Watchman begin to point forward and he said look out when you see the world the women of the world becoming more and more beautiful he said know that it's a flashing red light light of his coming that's right amen and when you see that that that he he preached a message the God of this evil age he began to show how that the the the the idol of this Modern Age would be a half-dressed woman some sex goddess some queen that they would put out you look at the day today everything that's out there whether it be advertisement whether it be Hollywood movies anything churches oh churches advertised how they do it Benny H wasn't going nowhere he got rid of his little humble wife amen got him a sex Queen a went National y oh yeah sure you know Nation Global whatever he went here that just happened here recently you look at them you look at all these name band preachers what do they got to do they God if they don't have a sex Queen for a wife they'll put her away and get him one right oh my that's right oh what is it everywhere you look a it's just one goddess after another Billboards plastered all over what was it was a sign to get ready to go amen right was it was a sign to get ready to go he talked about how that the women would be in politics and even to the point that there would be that there would be one that would rise up and actually be of a great power like a a vice president or something yeah right well we've already wait we're we're that close and maybe even a little closer if we really knew what the truth of the matter was right sure we don't know where that is but we do know that there that that's a sign there was never a day in 1932 do you think a woman Congressman well that would have never went over right that would have never went over a woman politician are you crazy that wasn't they were they were they were throwing rocks at them in the street because they were trying to get some equal rights back then y but yet look at today the women have Rose to power you look at the CEOs of your bank y you look at the ones that your loan officers and the one that you have to go get your money from how many of them are women you go into your doctors and your hospitals how many of them are controlled by women H floors controlled by women the very things that matter most here you your health your government and your money controlled by women the Bible says that your women will be your rulers and your children will be your oppressors that's right Propet of God look forward way back there look Beyond his own natural years and said this is what you got to look for he said don't let your children watch don't let your children read those Comics oh my those cartoons and things he said why it's setting them up for a blast and yet they they that's the that's the uh the modern babysitter oh yeah set your kids in front of a cartoon cuz you don't have time to spend with them yourself so you put them in front of the idiot box and make your children a bunch of idiots that's right there a couple of things just a couple of things what was it he was pointing to the enemies that were going to come right he talked about how the movies would destroy Faith he said you look at those those heathens over in the foreign lands in India and Africa he said we come over there pray for one person they get healed have 20,000 healings in a moment over one prayer 20,000 s truck loads of stretchers Wheelchairs and crutches and haul them out of the city seven truck loads of them you could pray all night and all the next day and still today the people of the United States amen one here and one there will catch a little bit of Faith every now and then what is it is we've just been hollywoodized until we have lost our faith what these it was things now I'm I'm going somewhere with this amen watch he said and in this great time of trouble in the city the Young Folks ignoring it and many people who did not care about what the Watchmen had to say of course they were in The Tavern drinking and party and going on the soldiers were all drinking they were having a great time they thought they were just as safe as they could be oh yeah right we we think today in this good old us OFA you think you're safe yeah oh my they just arrested that woman was Jihad Jane she was a white woman she was as American as American can get conspiring to kill foreign non Muslims and was bringing that back to the United States oh my oh my that was just one they caught how many were they don't even know about you think the only thing that's holding it back right now is that there's four Angels amen are holding back the the plagues and the judgments of God until God can take out the elect right brother nothing was going to harm them because they were simply lit up as we would call it on the spirits of whiskey and mixed drinks and then all of a sudden there came the Chariots rolling right into the city The Tavern doors were broken in and the homes and the slaughtering weapons was at work just because they refused to hear the warning of the Watchman we many times we find that people that they put aside the warnings of the preacher God raised up preachers amen God set preachers among you amen evangelists and pastors around this country and they warning the people prepare yourself get more spiritual serve God live for God and one of the people do they get caral and more carnal and more carnal until finally Here Come Those demon those those uh Spirits right out of that river Euphrates coming down 200 million million demons coming down into the into the ecclesiastical realm to bring uh uh that was on the those uh people over in the second world war but now they're coming against you and me and we don't prepare ourselves for it come on we don't pray no more we've lost him that our soul loveth we're wandering about the streets and the highway Oh Come and Let The Watchmen find you tonight amen let the Watchman call you out let him point to you tonight where did you lose him did you lose him in front of your your your computer somewhere yeah did you lose him on some filthy uh uh website somewhere is that where you lost the spirit of God in your life that's where you'll find him repenting of those things amen you've got to repent you've got to call on God God won't hear no prayer that you have but God be merciful to me a sinner right slaughtering weapons he said we let down the bars yes we let down the bars right said all the Sheep got out and all the goats got in yeah how they get in we let down the bars am we let down the bars we let these things down and we see all these things slipping back into our lives oh people run to God tonight amen Bible says the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds oh my watch they said Watchman what of the night Isaiah listen to what he says he says Watchman what of the night yeah weary Soul wondering what is what is the night where where are we in this thing oh yeah right and and and the Watchman shouts back the morning cometh and the night also he says what look at the continuity of the scripture how that it follows nature that the morning cometh that's a given we know it's coming but the night also what is that you know and he says you look at when that when that sun is rising what does it do but it congeals those atmospheres it pushes begins to push that Darkness to where the darkest hour is just before the dawn right amen the darkest time of the night the coldest hour that's when the the condensation comes on the clothes line that's when the when the fro sets in and what is it it's that cold dark hour that's where she was looking for her lover she went out in that time and he said watch when one of the night he said the morning cometh right the morning will break Eternal bride in Fair and the chosen one Shall Gather to their home amen Eternal bright and fair right oh what is it it's going to be on the other side yeah we see that day coming but what about him whom my soul loveth said but the darkness comes also yeah the Night comes too there's two things that are coming right we see that the Bible says that there was Darkness upon the Earth right and gross Darkness upon the people that's right yeah you see what was it that their minds became alienated like it was in the days of Sodom and gomorra where their hearts were continually on evil y oh he said but there was going to be some that would be watching for the morning right watching for the morning right inject something here so if you can me consider me to be his servant just before the break of day that's why this horrible Gloom is over the Earth it's just before the coming of the Lord Jesus there's no more hope left in nothing but his coming GL nations are against Nations they have they have fooled through God's laboratory till now they've got enough power now to blow one another into one another into Atomic ashes and they're Wicked and they're unreligious and they're un Christlike and the only motive that they have an objective is to destroy and they are inspired by a destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men oh yeah sure amen and so here the these Angels were waiting for the opportunity they were just waiting for the nod from God to to loose their vials and their loose their plagues upon the Earth but the Bible says that he that lth will let until he be taken out of the way he was a was a person of Christ in the church when that church is lifted out and then the destroying angles are relased released upon the earth oh but let me tell you what was it watch when one of the nights so the morning coming the morning's coming who's the morning coming for look he says the morning cometh the night's coming too yeah the morning is coming for those who are ready for the morning thank you so many people not ready for the morning oh they're ready to go to work tomorrow ready to go back to school tomorrow they're ready to go you know do whatever they do their sporting event or or their you know entertainment or vacation or whatever it is where they go out and you know I always found it striking that people go on vacation and forget God yeah oh no yeah they just God we're going to take a vacation from God for a little while you go to Hawaii and stretch out on the beach for a little while need a little Sun yeah what is that I'm going go to France and live it up for couple of weeks you know just just got to have a got to let my hair down you know got to loosen up a little bit oh yeah yeah get over there and little social sipping on some French wine going down the Rivier blah blah blah blow off a couple of grand missionaries can't even get out of the can't even get across the get across the ocean to go preach the gospel and people squander thousands of dollars on their vacation I never figured that one out for life of me right but say if I had a million dollars I couldn't do that no that's right brother I I just I couldn't see it I couldn't I could not even fathom such a thing it says the morning's coming for those who are ready for the morning yeah right are you preparing for morning friends Glory are you preparing for his coming this is not just anything this is not just the President coming to see it it's not just a parade it's not just a picnic we're getting ready for this is the one that my soul loveth oh Watchman what of the night it's coming friends the morning cometh right for those who are ready for the morning oh my and the night is coming for those who are not prepared for the morning right exactly may God prepare our hearts today for the morning shall break Eternal bride and fair as the poet has said his chosen ones to gather to their homes beyond the sky when the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there oh let us pray the Holy Spirit was sent back to the tower to Tower in men not just a single man yeah right that's where you know we understand that God had a great ministry and brother BR he also had great Ministries and and other men down Through the Ages brother Brown spoke so highly of Charles finny abely you know spoke highly of Smith turned a blind eye to him wouldn't pay no attention right but watch what he says here the Holy Spirit has sent us a Watchman that watches over us he is our Guardian the Holy Spirit was sent to lead man to be the Watchman of our soul exactly right man wasn't to watch over one another it was the Holy Spirit to watch over us he's our tutor our teacher the holy spirit is to teach us then we cry out to the holy Spirit looking at these things Watchman what the amen we call out to the Watchman the Holy Spirit the one that was that was that was enthroned that was towered in our souls that was to to draw our attention to a word there to draw our attention to a to a to an intelligence an intelligence of this day right oh but yet not to get ourselves confused with things that are around us or other things or other messages but but to focus on what God's purpose is for this hour just in this in closing now we find that this woman when she found this one that her soul loveth oh yeah look what she did the Bible says that she embraced him that she held on to him and she says and I will not let him go would not let him go oh would to God that we would have an experience tonight that we could we would take a hold of Christ and that we would not let him go GL but Watch What Happens she says and I took him to my mother's house yeah into the Chamber of her that conceived me yeah now watch this this this points right back to the scripture in Joel that says all the years that the pommer worm the korm the caterpillar all these years that they have taken away he says I will restore amen say the Lord I'm going to restore this I'm going to bring it back watch he's going to bring it back to what it was in the beginning a full bride tree is that right now that we find what also that the prophet of God preached us a message he says what was the three-fold purpose of God to manifest himself to have preeminence in the church and to restore that church back to an Eden condition to take the church back to to the Genesis back to the beginning look where she took him amen not to the place where she had lost him but she took him back to the place where she was conceived took him back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine where she was birthed on the day of Pentecost oh my that's where that's the message of the hour is to restore us back to take us back to Genesis to take us back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine and and it it's not to take us off into the misty blue some where oh no sir friends you know and and I always say it like this you know if if if you know if that's not the message then how is this how is this tree that is supposed to put forth another Branch right yeah he said if it's another Branch it'll be just like the first one right amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever God is not going to have respects to anything but that book of Acts church that's it that's the only thing and so now that they look for it down through the church ages that we've looked through through our lives we've looked down through the last you know the last uh decade or two we've looked for Christ but let me tell you friends there's a Watchman on the wall amen that's pointing back to the word back to the word get back to the word friends don't deviate from it when you get back to it hold on to it do not let it go am hold on to it with all your heart because remember when the son Rises and there is a rising of the sun when it breaks forth like that oh and light we'll be able to see clearly then then we they said then are what we behold in a glass Darkly now oh we'll see him face to face who will we see the one that my soul love oh how will I know him because I'll be like him but I'll see him just in the right oh that's the word of God amen amen that's how we'll see him because I'll be just like him bone
