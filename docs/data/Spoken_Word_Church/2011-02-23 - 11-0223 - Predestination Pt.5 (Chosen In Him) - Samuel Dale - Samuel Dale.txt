in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Ephesians 1 and just remember each one of the ones that are sick among us and all and just pray that the Lord would reach down and touch each one you know um I found a pen out in the parking lot not Sunday I think it's across but anyhow I'll leave it laying up here yeah it's a Cross Pin if anybody lost one in the parking lot Terrance okay you didn't have it so glad to know that found it so anyhow but just remember to pray I said for all these who are sick remember Brother Dean he's having a lot of problems and just keep him in your prayers just pray that the Lord would would bless us all and and be with sister Rebecca flying back in tonight I think getting in pretty around 9:00 or something so remember her and pray that the Lord would give her a safe journey amen cuz that's the main thing Ephesians 1 is any announcements I generally forget we're doing pretty good for this month we don't have a lot to announce but you know we're try to do not this coming not this coming Saturday for the next two weeks yeah on the 5th 5ifth of March be Bible study so remember that all right father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we know that you give them to us freely and we pray that you would just bless us now with understanding because the one thing we want tonight is not Material wealth not to this or that or the other and Lord it wouldn't even be to feel good it would be for one thing that you'd come down and open your word because if you open your word unto us then surely we will feel good and all will be well so just do as we have asked you and you promised it so we're depending upon it bless each one remember the sick ones and just be with each one be with sister Rebecca there flying back in give them a safe trip Lord and let your love be with each one we love you and we commit all to you now in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 1 we'll begin reading at verse three this should be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word we have a good many quotes So now remember we're talking about predestination predestination the act of determining a Destiny or a thing to take place you know time date situation whatever and that's well there's now there's a couple of them that just come out that way just give them out cuz a couple of them are stapled together then the rest of them is not supposed to be okay I have trouble with that printer all right but now talking about predestination they said the act or state of predetermining something and how does God do that we found that he does it by for knowledge now as I say you know we people want to hear this great Revelation about uh how we was back dire and we was this all right we're going to begin to get into those things and begin to talk about it a little bit but the first point is to remember that if he predestines in any other form than the fact of forn knowledge first then you have him predetermining without giving a choice right all right see now consider that fact see if you go to predestination in any other way than the way of approaching it by forn knowledge you've turned out to make God choosing and not giving us a choice but if you go by for knowledge then you can see that he could look down through and then he could predestinate what would be because of his forn knowledge of the fact that it would be all right now if God forn knows anything to be there is never any form or way that you can change that amen see you can argue well the the man got 15 years but don't you know that God knew he's going to going to give him 15 years see it's not something pulled over on God see all right see we we don't get into those forms we we stay is in the scriptures but now I hope you caught on to what I was to say in there on the service this Sunday and uh we were talking about I gave you a couple of quotes back where we would have them but brother brandom says on the the number one and number two of your notes is just kind of a repeat number three is to of a repeat of what we're talking about Sunday but brother Brandon says on Ephesians parallels Joshua 19651 15E he said listen to this predestination looks back to for knowledge that's right now watch you now that's down here he's got that quote identically but on this one what does he say I mean election election looks back to for knowledge that's right right right and predestination looks to Destiny now I don't know whether I've got it on the back of these notes but anyhow I look was looking at it a moment ago the prophet of God said predestination and election was the same thing amen all right so now what is he saying so we've got the other one Jesus arose he stated that 1956 405 that predestination looks back to forn knowledge and forn knowledge looks on to Destiny all right so that means that for knowledge comes before predestination right because it looks back to right all right so predestination as everybody thinks with this we're that with this and that you know form see it's got to look back to for knowledge amen all right and then if you're talking about elect well now brother Dale we are the elect well then he said election looks back y to for knowledge right sure amen all right so now you you argue with him about what you're talking about see I'm just wanting to believe it and if there's any common sense to language then see it would mean that for knowledge is is first yep right right then election or predestination follows thereafter yep or else you you've messed it up now you go any other way and you believe what you want to cuz I looking at the quote what today that brother said you're not going to change them anyway right amen and not you're not going to change people's mind right they're going to go right on saying well he was wrong there you know but he was right over here well that's all right go and do what you want to because what I'm trying my best to get you to see is if we approach it though in any other form than for knowledge first then you're changing what he said right even of election or predestination and he said it was the same thing right see we're elect according to for knowledge all right amen then the scriptures right the prophet's right you said but yeah we I want to get into all of this great great things that makes me feel so good to know this that of the other well it will all have to fit that's right are your feelings is because of something that you think is right Y and that won't do you any good see I ain't worried about feelings I'm worried about what the word says yeah but Brother D I just don't feel it well Cain said the same thing cuz he said I can't see the Revelation that Abel's got right right right so he turned around to God you remember we gave it turn the other day and he said you take it or leave it I've done all I'm going to do in other words that's right so I'm going to follow my thought my Doctrine see and that's what people are doing because they're not getting it into the right order see that election then in predestination now has to come after for knowledge y right you say well bring me the quotes in to show me where the Prophet taught it any other way cuz I've run it and run it and run it through as much as I can do with the computer you know and and and that's the words I find and the bases I find see that for knowledge has to be first right because if you take predestination first see that was that was the way that's what I said it it's seemingly right backwards to our thinking because you know if I wrote it down I'd have wrote it down that predestinated under for knowledge but see that won't fit the scripture nor the the prophet's message and that's what our mind is locked on so our mind has to be undone by Revelation are we still got the old doctrine that we had right so then you know pray for a revelation because that's the only way we'll ever get it see then what could he do then now we're going to talk about chosen in him because that's verse three amen now uh I'm not changing scriptures around I'm just saying verse three is covering where we are already in the Born Again experience of in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's why I jumped over verse three to go on to verse four cuz verse three is telling you that you're already already already but then verse four goes back to show you how you can attain unto that all right so we'll get back to verse three you know eventually but I want to go with verse four it says according as he has chosen us in him right now how was we chosen because we were so good we were chosen in him all right when were we chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love all right so now according to the Bible revelations what is it 13:8 that he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right so now if he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world then when he was accepted we was accepted in him amen that's right he said now wait just a minute brother Dale because you you you've been laying it down so far about for knowledge and and emphasizing heavily on the basis that God looked down and saw you MH make the choice right well that's true he did that's right then he could act according to your choice and he'd have salvation for you because he knew you'd want to be saved now that doesn't change when we're getting into this of being chosen in him all right now cuz you see that's the point I've tried to make I gave it back to you on uh the super sign there in 63 11:29 that he doesn't predestinate by his desires cuz he desired that everybody be saved amen but he predestines according to his for knowledge amen all right he knew who would accept him it and who would not therefore he could make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning amen number three on your nose all right he knew what you were going to do right huh now we're going to get into it in a minute chosen in him we get to that part but let's get this other out of the way contining for the Fai number 4 55 to20 perhaps back Yonder before either was born he knowed we was going to meet here tonight he is an infinite God he knows all things predestinated certain things to take place but even before the world ever formed he fornew all things that's right now remember the point I made on the first one and I forgot it on a couple more I said the basis of what we have of understanding anything in the Bible is based upon whether or not God forne right right that's right or whether or not he is infinite right amen whether or not he knows everything right see now if he doesn't then what do we got to worry about that's right maybe the part that I am he'd forget he say well he can forget brother they right if we put it under the blood right but don't you think he forew that because he had to make a way that's right had to make a way that it could be put under the blood all right so then that's where we ought to take it and and and deal upon that now so watch what he says on Modern events made clear by prophecy 1965 1206 he's come talking about according to the word if it comes from God because it's to vindicate or to prove God's presence and he forew all things all these things being by his for for knowledge he ordained for ordained it's called in the Bible predestinated every age to its place and every man to its place and every Messenger to its place he's God the devil ain't pulling nothing over on him right so now he's predestinated by his forn knowledge no he fornew all right now he forew then that Jesus Christ was going to die on the cross right he so much forew it y that as far as he was concerned and what he wrote in the Bible about it yep that it was before the foundation of the world right now that's how much his for knowledge was right all right but now had Jesus Christ not come and died it would have proven that it was not God's forn knowledge correct sensible but see he so fornew it that he could go ahead and write all the names in The Book of Life or write them in a section of it that he could even later I said a section of it a lot of people might not understand that but brother around divided it it's one book but many SE two sections amen Church age book we can cover that if you'd like it but see he forne so then when the lamb was slain all right you and I the prophet said were slain in him amen than that's right now so then if that be true then 2,000 years ago to fulfill what he saw before the world it would have to take place as I was saying or your your word would be wrong all right so we believe the word's right we believe that he was crucified in the mind of God before the world ever begun in his forn knowledge all right so then at the same time then as he was slain you and I were slain at the same time that's right in him thank you Lord all right so when he came into the world we had to be in him yeah now not his people right amen that's where we miss it at not his people I'm just going up so far and stop now I'm going to back up cuz we'd be on verse three but see we were in him when he walked the shores of Galilee that's right amen but how were we in him in that eternal life that he had that's right now I'll go ahead and say it because it'll come on back up later in that one soul that was dwelling in him which was the soul of almighty God right which was eternal life that's right now if we were part of that we're okay amen right if we're not part of it we're not okay right sensible so then we got to go back and see that we were chosen in him amen not that we was all standing up in heaven right all right but in the mind of God before the world ever begun in his for knowledge that's right he saw what would take place on the earth 2,000 years ago all right no way that could stop from happening amen but yet that being in God's mind now listen that being in God's mind for 4,000 years could not save one person right that's right that's right that's right okay everybody get it you couldn't give eternal life to one person right y right that's why they were waiting on him to come amen he had to pay the price for All sin right he died once the scripture says for all all right now so then there's no way so you can bypass right it taking place right see if you go to the predetermining of Eternity as most of the people try to then you're going to byass Calvary right then why did Jesus have to die if we came with eternal life yep that's right as the people want to believe that's right well brother D brother BR said it that's right but he's also the one that said he we died in him he's also the one that said you got to be born again to receive eternal life he's also the one that said I had to be born again talking about himself see but you see when I'm trying to get a point to you then we'll move on we've got to go back there and see that we were chosen in him right then he could predestinate all right not predetermined the world to be a certain way but he could see what the world would be and predetermine that way because it is it's it's settled right huh but he didn't predetermine it cuz he didn't make it that way right he knew that all he had to do was just put us on free moral agency and we'd fall that's right amen his for knowledge let him know that that's right well brother Dale if I would have just been I'm glad you come up with that idea in your mind do you think you f back there why do you fall now when you got the new birth right that's right you don't fall from eternal life no but we fall every day and stumble don't we am okay you get off the garbage can get on the word of God but now listen see then we've got to look back and see that we were chosen in him now I'm not going to cover this I know that he chose us but I'm not going to deal deal with that tonight now that'll be another message cuz if I get into that I can't bring out what I want you to see I'm wanting you to see one thing that when he died before the foundation of the world in the mind of God that was just as real right as it was the day it took place upon amen the Earth Yep as far as God is concerned right right but as far as we are concerned because if it's if it's a reality like we you know we want to get our minds so in a reality on some things and in the garbage can on the other but if it's so much in a reality that he died before the world then you don't need salvation that's right but the fact that he saw it before the world it meant it had to take place 2,000 years ago right amen right you can't change things right God forew what you and I would do and that's why the prophet said he would know how many would receive him and said he didn't do it halfhazard you know to say I'll just throw it down there I'll just go and maybe there somebody will accept it no he said he knew amen that's right see then if he knew right now then the choosing the part I want you to see is it is we were chosen in him amen before the foundation of the world all right but the choosing in him was on the basis of the fact that he knew you would choose him when he got here right all right everybody understand that amen right that he knew by his for knowledge that you would accept it down here right that's right so he would have it ready approaching any other way and you're you're going wrong right amen you can't line up scriptures and you can't do it but people don't care and ain't going to change nobody except what wants to hear right right I realize that but you see the book of Ephesians I gave it to you there number five on your notes I gave it back to you I mean number seven on your notes he said Paul is addressing this letter to those that are in Christ y the book of Ephesians number seven on your notes it's addressed to the whole Bible is addressed to those that are in Christ it's not written to The Sinner it's written to condemn The Sinner right all right but it's not written to him right see it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus because no man can call Jesus the Christ what except it be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so he's not writing to the world this is a book written to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen even in the Old Testament it was only written to Israel right amen the chosen of God it written about I'm sure they're around cuz we're here right lady oia tells you what we're blind wretched miserable and naked and all like that yeah it tells a lot about the world but it's not written to the world right it's like brother R explained it if I was overseas somewhere you know going on a trip and I write my wife a letter see or she writes me a letter that's to me right now she may tell me what happened around the house she may tell me that one of the neighbors got hurt in a car wreck she may tell me that this that or the other happened but that has nothing to do with what me and her's doing right me and her's writing a letter to each other right to communicate so God sent the Bible to the Believers right right so then it's not telling the world that they're chosen in Christ right everybody's not chosen in Christ right right but it's telling those that were chosen in Christ what is going to happen to them while we here right that's right make your calling an election sure is that scripture amen see all right so we're chosen in him all right now it's hard to keep back off of the other part right right so look at number eight on your notes you got it spoken word Original Seed he said he's talking to the church now this is not to the outside y this is church all right the Bible is written to the church to those that are in Christ Jesus to do what to show you how you got into Christ Jesus right all right and showing us that before the foundation of the world he died to purchase salvation for you and I he didn't need it himself right amen so it was to purchase it for you and I all right at the same time he died to purchase it his for knowledge let him know who would want it right amen are you listening that follow me see then if he know who would want to be saved according to his for knowledge then he wouldn't as I showed you or we were talking about it there how can the thing form say why did you form it he didn't form us that way we formed ourselves that's right now then being that way we don't blame God we blame ourselves amen all right but watch now see we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world right now we'll get back to a little bit in a minute but look on down to some of the quotes now you ought to know it but just I just gave you some quotes like here you himym 1956 number n on your notes 12:15 and that through the one offering he has perfected forever those that are that are Sanctified that are called for ordained chosen in him before the foundation of the world 284 Church age book you talking about elect and he says those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and that Ro great Royal seed Jesus Christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and his reproducing see showing that it took place down through the church ages what he saw you understand why I'm using that one he saw before the world but in this statement brother brandom is even caring it to showing that down through the church ages that seed would come forth all right he calls it a great hidden Mystery on Christ The Mystery of God revealed number 11 he said what did he when did he choose us before the foundation of world when his great hidden Mystery this great secret he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world now not according to the life Revival okay he's chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world I'm just looking down you read on down through on them while you're going Ephesians parallels Joshua 60 1960 5:15 when did God choose us when did God choose you that's got the Holy Ghost when did he choose you before the foundation of the world he chose you and sent Jesus that he might be the perpetuation of your sins to call you to reconciliation to himself to love you know right chosen Us in him 150 Church 's book and it says that he had chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect am you can't get away from it that's right that's right all right now chosen in him so when he was accepted all that will ever have eternal life y you know part of the body of Christ we're talking about aren't they were accepted right there right amen why the prophet would say it's not whether you accept him or not y it's whether or not he accepted you amen cuz we'll get back to that more Sunday would it see all right but now follow what I'm talking about predestination then looks to the destiny that you and I would arrive to all right now in God's mind Jesus Christ died before the world as I said a moment ago right but then he was predestinated to die one day there on the cross right and there was no way to change that right because it was predestinated amen that's right now but then if we were chosen in him there's got to be a reason that we could be chosen in him now listen where you won't cross up some of the other thoughts see it's got to be in a line to be able to to be brought down to be able to be understood so it's not the person we got there in the quotes that comes predestinated eternally from God but the person see the person not predestinated eternity but the seed of the word amen so now the the forn knowledge of God would allow him to know each one of us and what we would do right right and he knew we would accept him right he knew that so he'd have it ready for us but that seed that he's talking about by his forign knowledge he knew see y James collie would come into the world and he knew one day he would accept him as his savior or else he'll never be saved that's right see now he proved it by what he done right now that's the forn knowledge of God right that would allow him to look down through and see okay so then James colie as a person became predestinated by for knowledge but James kie as a person didn't come predestinated eternally from God am do I need to state that a time or two again it's not the person n that's right that comes predestinated eternally right the person is predestinated by God's for knowledge just as well as he knows everybody else in the world Amen all right go I've got him in the back over there where brother Brown said people don't believe in predestination unto rep probation he said you you don't believe that now how would he predestinate under rep probation you know which means to reject or you know deny reprobate see those with a reprobate mind turn into the grace of God into lasciviousness Etc see all right so James collie the person we see was born 60 something years ago and God gave him to make him a person his mother and daddy sure was the part that was used to bring the body but that wasn't what caused the body to come God is the only one that can give life amen all right amen but you see then the Soul and the Spirit came from God Amen to make him a person y but that Soul or that Spirit was not Eternal right now we'll get back to it cuz I don't want to go no further that way but you see at the same time before the world God looked down and saw James collie and saw that he would accept him as his savior he saw the age he would live in and if I don't get back to them they're in the message there you quotes that the seed was predestined ated for the age as well as the individual that's right you and I wasn't predestinated to be back down in any other age and brother brandom even covered how the election of the body would cover he said go back through your lineage and you find out God had to breed this person to that person to this person to that person that's what he said that's right to bring you that's right amen all right see it wouldn't matter to me if I was his blackish s or yellow as could be what would it make any difference right right right I want to be a Christian doesn't matter what I am or what it bred down to get me here I'm just glad I got here right amen but the main thing is I'm glad that I could accept him as my savior right then I could find out that I really didn't seek him see I can't stay off that that I didn't seek him he chose me that's right all right but why did he choose me now why did he choose James call it that's right now there where your seed comes in at and it's easy to see that Jesus was a predestinated seat right amen not no problems right right nobody I mean anybody got any problems with seeing that Jesus was a predestinated Eternal seed that's right no no problem should be all right is it any problems where he would tell like uh the prophets that I knew you and for orain you amen before the world cuz he knew what they would do brother said he knew what Abraham would do see he knew what Jacob would do right he knew what Esau would do right all right so he could determine on that basis Y what he would do no see then it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally right huh right it's the cedar word right all right but remember now the cedar word now you're going to have to think with me for a little bit cuz I don't know no other way of saying it that seed can lay there for a long time before it is given eternal life right everybody agree right you can lay there a long time dormant the prophet called it that said mhm be the seed the word MH right but laying their dormant until God pours the water on it or the Holy Spirit to Quicken it right why is it that we don't know everything right right right right but yet you read it right yet you memorized it right right but yet it's got to be quickened amen to be made alive that's right all right that's right now so then how were we chosen in him he said well it's because he knew we'd choose him all right that has to do with James collie right yep did he you James call choose him but I'm talking about something deeper than that that everybody wants to talk about but they don't want to bring it down by for knowledge and get in the correct order right how are we chosen in him now number one is to be chosen in him you got to be in him right amen is that sensible that's right amen if it's in somebody else I wouldn't be chosen in him all right so then how was I in him not James colie right right no you had to be looking at something else amen God's word is his seed right amen or in other words the seat of God is the word of God right now then if the seed of God is the word of God and we would agree that Jesus was predestinated eternally but he had to come to Earth and live it out that's right we would agree the prophets would be predestinated right GI and callings are predestinated right right now but you see that's doing with what he says what he's doing right but if we can see Jesus was predestinated eternally why can't we see that we was in him that was the way we was predestinated that's right that's the only dealing of Eternity you can deal with see that way then end the eternal life you have tonight are you with me now the eternal life you have tonight the new birth you received that always was eternal right that's right now I've asked a question for many many years for somebody to explain it over all of these seed doctrines that they've got it's the new birth the birth of the seed you're born with everybody wants to make it or is it the birth of the word that you hear after you get here amen that's now which one is it that's all I want to know amen cuz if you tell me it was what I was before the world and I don't need eternal life that's right I don't need the new birth I don't need anything cut my head off I go to heaven y that's what I told a man one time I said you know if he always was eternal and just whack the babies kill everybody which is everybody going to heaven but everybody wasn't chosen in him now you following me I have to keep repeating it see if you keep saying that we were chosen in him and that totally has to do with what we do down here that's for knowledge right but that doesn't put us to where we could be chosen in him I'd invite you to listen this type over and over CU might sound confusing chosen in him before the foundation of right that's right amen then what part of you then could that be dealing with that's right come on now I keep making illustration to where you'll understand what part of you could be chosen in him before the world and not do away with the for knowledge that would know know where that seed would land then you could see God did have a plan and a purpose sure God did have children God was a Healer God was a savior he just didn't display it till he come hear it right you see AR you glad that you can believe the word right when other people can't believe it we're not going off on nobody that can't believe it that's because that's you know don't Crow all that's right you might have to eat some of it that's right so just leave everything alone and just believe what God says right so how then were we chosen in him because when he died we died right when he was accepted we were accepted right amen but he had to wait two 4,000 years just a time not in counting what how long it was back before the foundation world right to be able to make manifest upon the Earth that he was that predestinated seed right right that he did have eternal life contrary to a lot of them in the message say now that he didn't have eternal life well you got a problem man that's right you got a natural man dying for your sins and you're still in them but you see instead of sitting down and listening that's right to somebody that can at least get into it a little bit and study it out they're not going to listen to you especially preachers that's right they're going to preach whatever comes to their mind they're not going to listen what you say right and I know that I've known that ever since I started but that ain't going to stop me from preaching amen ain't going to stop me from listening to let God speak to me about something that's right cuz you see we were chosen in him as I said not the fact see that's what your mind wants to lock to the fact see of what I brought out about for knowledge so far that we were just predestinated in him because he seemed we want it right it's got to go further than that right now now listen there's a lot of people want he turn life y right but how come they don't get it right now you tell me Judas wanted to die and go to hell and I got some stock on a Brooklyn Bridge I'll tell you now he wanted to go to heaven right MH there never been a person that wanted to go to hell there's people that really you look at them and their lives are better than ours you look them at it their their doings and everything look across the land today and you see the people out there that are are spending every hour of the day trying in some way four people shot over there the other day and they were carrying Bibles around the world been doing that for years and years right I'm not saying they're not bride but I'm saying if they wouldn't Born Again believer they're not bride you can spend all of your life show me where came was wrong except for one one thing right he wouldn't accept the Revelation that it was the blood right if he to offered the blood and then took his offering up there behind that would have been Works following his faith that would have been all right y would you see everybody wasn't chosen in him am that's right you said but but but brother Dale you're s making it contradictory because you're saying that people want to be saved and God won't save them no they're wanting to go to heaven right they're not wanting to be saved they're not wanting to go to hell that's it exactly they're not wanting to be lost so thereby they won't accept him in his fullness right sure they accept him for salvation or healing or something but they won't accept him to be the Lord of their life right am see then they wouldn't chosen in him now if you're listening to what I'm talking about only the seed was what was chosen in him that's it amen y the seed was what was chosen in him the word right and there's a word for every age predestinated to that age amen and the people of that age made that word alive right and it become a Eternal predestinated seed right dwelling in a human being because it was the word what is the new birth well I see how did I C know it's the birth of the word amen and that's why people won't accept the word That's The Parables the Lord Jesus gave y they took it and kept it for a little while but then the cares and the the the things of life and all like that come in and they turned it down as I said about Judas he was there for three and a half years right putting every whole life on the line right but yet in the finality he proved what he was right he proved he wasn't chosen of God now listen Judas was chosen to be in the ministry of the day chosen to have the gifts of God chosen for all of those things y but yet he wasn't chosen for eternal life right so he had the seed without it being able to give life the prophet said that Jacob was seed but said Esau was not seed right all right he talks of none seed there's nothing in nonseed to Quicken what is a nonseed now in the hybrid condition if you go back and plant it it's going to go out of existence so that's the way of doing it so the easiest way to go is like with a mule the the mule can't reproduce itself right right because it's none seed sensible right but chosen in him well it was something I done good something something that's Catholicism pay you way there pave the parking lot well that's what we used to do in the Baptist you know we had one fell that he painted the church every time his KNE painted inside and that wouldn't charge to die and I guess they wrote over his Tombstone that he painted the churt do you know what he was he was a homosexual no joke everybody there know what he was put names on the pews why do they put it on that far you put it on there cuz you want everybody to know how much money you give oh my right I bought a Pew I'm going to heaven cuz that Pew is going and I'm going too now that's about as much as we got it based on I if the Pew makes it we make it just don't let nobody sit down in your Pew they might get there you not all right joke a little to get you out of the sternness but listen how were we chosen in him without making it they even have to choose everybody come on if it's not according to his desires he'd got to choose everybody that's right sure we put it on the basis and that's wonderful hold on to that until it comes to you all right hold on to it that he looked down and through it and see I would choose him that's good but what caused you to choose him when the prophet said we didn't choose him right said he chose us that's right and the Bible said we didn't choose Him scripture says no man assult God at any time but yet don't you remember in your life when you were coming up through and you were crying and praying and fasting and everything else to seek God to try to get the new birth but EV that evidently is not what he's looking at right but see if we were chosen in him that means we got to be a part of him amen right amen and who was he John 1 tells you who he was that's that's right in the beginning was a word the word was with God and the Word was God did we make that with as a two that's it's good to have that word with because it means you and I can be there CU if it just said in the beginning was the word the Word was God you wouldn't have that word with in there even but it's put in there showing that we're part of him right cuz it's only the seed that comes predestinated eternally right so sure God looked down through time and saw who would accept he's not going to give that seed to someone that will that he does that he knows won't accept it now he'll offer it to him just as he offered that Pope the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right because that way the thing form can't say why don't you do this he offered salvation to everybody in the world but he knows everybody's not going to receive it so couldn't he go ahead and write down names sure you agree amen you agree by his for knowledge he could write the The Book of Life and and write down the names of those that would be safe you agree now if you agree with that then you got to agree with this okay so swallow it now let's see if you agree if he could do that why didn't he at the same time know exactly where that seed was going to fall right and how you would accept it and that seed would be him like I said now seed's no good without water see that's where we want to go with all of that you know brother R made the quote that you know you have eternal life amen he made the quote but you read what he says if you were in him in the beginning then you always was eternal right what was always Eternal we know it's not James college right Body Spirit and our soul cuz each one had a beginning right right but if we can receive his eternal life then that eternal life is in you and I now it cannot be in you and I if we don't first hear the word are you listening right it's why it says why how can they hear without a preacher right now can he preach unless he be sent see you never see nobody in the Bible receive eternal life unless they had heard a sermon now show it to me right they had heard a sermon by somebody Peter the house of conelius yeah Peter on the day of Pentecost how can you get eternal life without first hearing the word right that's right but you see people are say but we always was eternal the eternal life you have always was eternal cuz then the same people will say God's the only one that has eternal life cuz he's the only one eternal life and that's Zoe So when you came into the world you didn't have Zoe life did you you had life permitted amen for you to live in but God knew the age you and I'd be living you agree he knew you would accept this message uh this message is a seed right so was Luther's message so was Wesley's message it was a seed right and the seed back there gave life but Luther's message today won't give you eternal life no that's right more is required right so how were we chosen we were chosen in him so get us out of the way peoples Body Spirit and souls we're get it all out of the way and get it down to the bases of looking right straight at him and seeing that when he paid the price he also saw it we would accept it right but back before then he already cuz now listen here's one thing brother Dale is going to tell you he does believe I believe in a predestinated Eternal y seed or word of God right amen I believe that that's right I believe that God before he stepped into the form of what we call for knowledge to bring knowledge of Earth and existence that he always was eternal and that he was already a savior that he was already a Healer right he didn't have know where to display it no but that was in amen he never gained any attribute when he come here amen I believe you that have eternal life that that eternal life is the children of God as Paul said we are his offspring right amen everybody in the world is a child of God by creation right everybody don't matter what the child is where it's born who it's born to it is a child of God by creation am cuz God is the only one that can create right all now so then he did have children right he dwelt alone what with his attributes right right that's right we were in him brother aroundand him expressing it said just like you were in your father right he said just like you go out and plant your little one seed and it grows up into an apple tree and that tree grows up get big old tree over plenty you know many years and starts performing and bringing forth apples right and you get bushel of bushel of apples off of it you know for years and years and every one of those apples was in that one little seed right amen now how you going to explain that amen you got to admit it's true that's right ever seed in other words when God planted an apple tree in the garden now we know the flood and all of that but come on over women just get what we're talking about every Apple that would ever be on any tree would have had it been on the trees that he originally planted that's infinite God if not where'd it come from could come from nowh else that's right you get them from another planet no you know some extraterrestrial being brought down some trees and stuck them out no exactly amen we don't believe in that amen amen all right but you were in your great great grandfather now you know what he's saying right so that means that you were in now I don't mind saying this cuz don't matter to me that means that you were in Adam or you was in the Beast in the beginning right that's infinite God now if you don't agree with that where did it come from right plain right where'd it come from that's all I wants answers I stir you up give me an answer but it doesn't matter to me whether I was born direct descendants from the Beast that don't make no bit of difference to me cuz a born again experience take care of everything amen that's right cuz once Eve had that child or her wound was polluted they could nothing come out there but pollution right right just telling it like it is but you see we were chosen in him now he didn't choose because of our goodness we'll get to that Sunday that's right nope bless have nothing to do with it no M amen he chose us but why would he choose you well brother Dale he seen that I wanted he seen I was going to be so yeah go ahead Pharisee es saw where the seed would land right as far as I'm going I'll get back with it Sunday he saw where the seed would land the seed comes predestinated eternally the seed was what was chosen in him right so he didn't die for everybody we preach it for everybody we believe it for everybody but he didn't die for everybody he died for only for those that would choose him but it was because he had already chosen you said well then that didn't give the other people a chance no that's where you goofed up now we done spent four sermons right we done put four sermons in on the four knowledge that he doesn't choose by desires his election is not there one in tonight's message somewhere in here that his election doesn't come because of his choosing it's all on for knowledge amen but there is a seed right and just like it was with coming down through as The Great Masterpiece your Prophet preached Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and all of this and coming down and then the building of the body then you start the New Testament and then you got to Matthew Mark Luke and John then you got coming over and you got it coming down building a body and when you come down through the seven Church ages and he said Mary represented you know ausa Street represented Mary that the word was in her y the word was in Mary right yep right but she was not the seed the seed was in her so is it down to the ages that each one was a partial for their time but in the end time it's got to come back to the original seed that's right we are not ausa Street Pentecostal amen that's right we are the seed right am reproduced again that's right so we were chosen in him y now put it in plain language and then I quit other words God had Offspring children he knew that all he had to do was turn us loose in life cuz he could never display his attributes as healer savior Etc cuz that would not have happen had he kept it in the way before he allowed it to be where we would have a fallen condition right right but then he knew where that seed would land that's right many are called right few are chosen but in the few that's chosen you know yourself that you can be chosen and still miss it right says whether or not we want the word right is the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right that's right what is the evidence whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right why because how can you deny it if you're word too right amen so when you received a new birth what was it you had to First hear the word and then when the word was quickened it was made alive it was exactly the word before the foundation of the world dwelling in a human body he talking about the uh the little woman that was married I believe that's right uh four times and the fifth one wasn't hers Etc he said look where that seed landed yep now we're quick to talk about that Mary could receive the seed you know but what about that a little prostitute right but God knew all he had to do was cross her path right and she had then what did your Prophet call it we'll get back to it what did he say she had he said she had representation one time off predestination the other time he said from predestination you see you go back to for knowledge I hope you catch on I said listen over and over you go back to full knowledge that's back P's predestination right an election I hope you're understanding it right amen we see there's something back P for knowledge amen right amen now listen to this wording and I'll quit because having for knowledge everybody listening right having for knowledge would bring you into an existence greater than to remain without letting that forn knowledge be known so there is something back P for knowledge right and that's the Eternal God right and that Eternal God had children that he was going to see amen come forth but he would allow us to come this way to where that we would learn how to serve him and worship him and he could display his attributes to save us CU a son is always a son you didn't become seed by the new birth right right now am I quoting the prophet he said you were always wor seed that's why you could be born again that's right the new birth was what the transmitting of God's life from him down into you and I right that we could really see who our father is right that's right see then he'll never be once he come down on the day of Pentecost and brought that Soul down he'll never be self existing anymore right that's right because he exists with his people right thirst in New Birth let's stand come on brother thirst the new birth chosen in him amen before he predestinated it to come to Earth brother Dale you're just saying what all these other people said you just got a better way of explaining it I've listened to a lot of them Tred to explain it and I can't get it CU if you mess up and leave off four knowledge you have missed it you're going to predetermine and you're going to predestinate Eternity and that's not the way it is chosen in him what you think about it what we got 369 red book 369 in the red book anybody have a need are you part of him do you have eternal life dwelling within you if you do that eternal life is not see we use the word because it is because it's part in the bases that you and I are just you know there's so many of us but is it part like we call part cuz to me part means you take an apple cut it up you give away the Apple you know the parts you run out of apple in God part means you take an apple cut it up you give it out and every time you give it away there's more than what you give away you know you start out with one apple and you look B your feet and our L bush all over the place that's the way God imparts he doesn't lose he gains that is his offspring go ahead brother God isus the Everlasting father will King eternally the wonderful and wisdom
