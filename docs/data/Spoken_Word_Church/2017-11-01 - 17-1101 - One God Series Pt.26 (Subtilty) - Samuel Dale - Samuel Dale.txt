1A) 58-0928E  THE.SERPENT'S.SEED_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-2 N-4  SUNDAY_
«  145       †        Notice. Now, here's what taken place. I believe, and can support it by the Bible, that it is the serpent that did it. The serpent is that missing person between the chimpanzee and the man, 'cause, listen, notice this now, that the serpent was not a reptile. He was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field.
    Now, I went and got dictionaries today from everywhere to look up this word, what the word of "subtle" meant. It means "to be smart, to be crafty." And the best interpretation of the--of the Hebrew from "m-a-h-a-h, mahah" means "having a true knowledge of the principles of life."

1B) 60-0522E  ADOPTION.4_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  AD.PT.4  SUNDAY_
«  135       †        And you women, Hmm. Devil's just made a... That's what he did in the beginning, and he certainly has made a target out of you sisters. He just does that just to... 'Cause he knows what he can do. He can deceive a woman a thousand times quicker than a man. I know that hurts your feelings, but that's the truth. That's exactly. That's what he done in the garden of Eden. He can make... Now, she was honest; she was sincere, but she was deceived. "Adam was not deceived," the Bible said. He wasn't deceived, but she was deceived. So he can deceive her. And yet pastors will go right out and ordain women preachers, put them out over flongre--congregations like that, and this Bible condemns it from Genesis to Revelation. You say, "Well, it's all right. It's all right. They got... They can preach just the same as any." I know that's right.

«  47       †          Now, we're all born, a free moral agent, to make any decision that we wish to. God justly does that. Because, He must put every man on the same basis, or He put the wrong man on... He put the first man on the wrong basis, that He put on free moral agency. See? We're just exactly, tonight, like ...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord [Music] do you I want to see you see my in Lippitt shining in the light of your lorry or out to power my whole evil a man here [Music] Oh amen and amen leo [Music] and I want to see a man and a man and a man and a man and I want to see good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to go along this reading of the scriptures turn with us to John 1 if we've been reading and then we'll go to 2nd Corinthians 11 John 1 2nd Corinthians 11 that Terrence has made the announcement but remember now that will not be a Bible study this coming Saturday okay go to a lot of the people are going to be gone and everything was weighed up to brother just remember that also remember time changes Saturday so then what is it fall backward so we wind up rolling that back it's time for getting our time set back on the way it's supposed to be and then remember that number the fellowship meeting will be at brother Tony zone I think it's the 19th but it's the third Saturday of the month so remember all of these you've got all the other announcements now Terrence is read them look what I didn't hear that well yeah yes you know we put them on the internet we put them on the the thing down stars to do them and we probably need to write it on the screen where we can have everything you know where everybody don't have an excuse but that's a good point okay but let's just pray father we thank you for your grace and your love Lord and thank you for everything we ask you now that you would just come among us and have you away with each one of us most of all forgive our sins cover us by the blood that we may walk in the light of your grace Lord we love you and we thank you just have your way tonight in the service open the eyes of our heart that we may see and walk in the light of your grace father have your wait that's your light shine through our hearts that we may see the day as it is and what's taking place in the hour that we're living we love you and we thank in Jesus name Shawn one says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men in light shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended at night now there's no way darkness can comprehend light it won't work all right now let's just read over in 2nd Corinthians 11 to get our thought for tonight Paul says verse one would to God you could bear with me a little while a little a little in my folly and indeed by women now what's he sayin okay would to God you could bar with me a little in my folly folly means foolishness okay but now it's also got another meaning to it the Cosi Paul says in first Corinthians what it 1:22 something I guess he's talking about the preaching of the gospel his foolishness or folly to mankind so he said I would that you bear with me as I try to preach the gospel well in my way that I can to where you can understand and make it as simple as can be and people would call it foolishness all right now watch what he says I am jealous over you with godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I have an unusual way of trying to approach the thought tonight that we'll be getting to but we've went through for a while and the you know trying to cover the things and and seeing and bringing it then we brought it down to mankind and you know of Adam and Eve not total mankind we brought it down to the creation of Adam and Eve and the wonderful way that God made them and he could not in any way make either one of them imperfect because you say well Eve wasn't made right well she was made out of Adam how much more right can you get because if you say that she wasn't created right you're saying Adam wasn't created right so then you understand what I'm getting at see then that's he was created as perfect as could be so Eve would have been created as perfect as you know she could be all right now but then we found I said an unusual way of approaching because we've dropped into a stage and watched the message tonight as it comes through all right we talked about what is sin what was the original sin all right yeah we found out that sin is unbelief sins not drinking gambling smoking running around with women stuff like that that's not sin you do those things because you're an unbeliever that's the attributes of unbelief all right you say well Christians have done wrong this way yeah and we're we know the message and I thank God for a prophet that would explain a lot of things to us Oh even that see that you could go out and and go totally insane and and do things wrong and stuff like that and God does in the county well thank God for the truth about the things that doesn't leave us to just be as we had you know a thought or an idea of doing now what we're going to do next Lord willing Sunday we're going to start picking up to try to pour it bring in the form of what is salvation and bringing it to a position to understand but what we want to do tonight is to do what I had said that remember whatever the original sin it was you know all right then that sin is still here now in its original form still dire and that's why we read from Paul you know that Satan who could tempt us and he's talking to the church through his subtilty as he did to Eve there in the garden all right now then we talked about sin as it is unbelief see the eve accepted Satan's lie which is only one word off right only one word off instead of taking God's word she accepted Satan's lie bringing it to unbelief first aren't unbelief in God the God would keep his word and do what he said then the actual act took place all right so then we say well what was what was original sin it was even the Beast you know no the original sin was the unbelief okay unbelief in God's Word she was desiring wisdom all right Satan told her or begin to speak through the Beast to talk to her about things and she began to reason with him to think about what he was saying and you know a lot of what he was saying I hope you caught that the last couple of Nations just called that's what I'm trying to get it to now that you know he didn't tell her this is a great big what you call an outlandish lie you know he didn't do that he just deceived her into believing what he was talking about and to get her to disbelieve God and His Word now not to just believe there was a god right prophet said no no no he said she believed in God but by tempting her the way he did through his subtlety and the word subtlety is actually here and brings it down to where brother Branham told us that Satan the actual quote to where he told us that Satan had a knowledge of the principles of life or that word subtility is the word that star you know as to bringing it to that all right now but really what I've done was she doubted God would keep his word after she had been told come on you remember the message she were told was told a truth she was told that you were told there in Genesis 1:28 to multiply and replenish the earth and said you were supposed to do that then we went through it where brother Brown said that was a commission from God that would have taken place here's were that I'm getting I told you that would be we'd be nailing down heavy tonight on this point see whatever the original sin was Satan is still using now quoting brother Branham he said he's still using the same identical tactics that he used in the garden he said because it worked so he's using it now yeah but the devil's not bothering these not just we're in the message we've got well why is it the people of this message are running after the wisdom and the things you know and parts of wellness this or that or the other or whatever making it so beautiful until people will just do like somebody did one time and I was in a place and then this brother was preaching away and I mention it to the sister later and I said sister I said she was running all over the place yeah I said that man was preaching an error well she left the church never came back well it was still right I mean was I mean and hateful to try to correct somebody and love to get us to see but you see it's so easy to take Satan's lie upon the Word of God so you get into all kind of things well we don't need to know this we don't need to know that who's telling you that sure ain't God right God wrote it God preached it through the Prophet you mean we're not to understand it certainly not in yeah we don't want to believe the devil is able to do it we don't to fool us yeah and now listen here's the point of tonight if it's correct that it was only one word that brought all of the sin in things into the world and death and all the things and the Prophet says we're not going back with one sin so now I don't know problems were saying that's the reason we've been here 50 years after the prophets been gone I don't have no problem with that do you well we're just waiting on you brother day well pray for me all right that's the best way to say it ain't nobody throwing those stones or pointing no fingers it's just trying to tell the truth the same devil that got Eve that run said got the Old Testament ride Joe is right now it was alright go to spawn words regional seat he said in that same lie got Jesus's bride yeah but I don't think that I don't think Jesus is brother you just accepted Satan's lie come on you just accepted Satan's lie cuz your prophets if you did then you need the quotes you need you see how easy it is to fall into unbelief as I said now if it's just one thing they brought us out then are we going back with a whole bunch of wrongs no we're going back when the bride comes to the basis that she gets rid of all of her unbelief and quit sake quit taking Satan's lie yeah but brothers knowing so honey did this with the Prophet and he was done and the Prophet or dying him in the ministry I heard of a church one time the pastor of the church said I can't not let that man preach brother Branham ordained him know how much unbelief is that right just a simple little thought of unbelief not a great big got Landy's wrong to do in this out of the other just to doubt what the Prophet said see that's why he was the one that said it when are we gonna start putting our whole life on what he said oh I do brother Dale I've got everything I've got on this I say it this way I got everything I know based upon it oh you think you own you usually I will stand with you on any discussion of the message as to anything the Prophet taught me but I'm honest enough to say and truthful enough to believe that Satan but around says no man is a match for the devil is that his word so now let's don't say what I wanted to delegate to see me I know bless God the Bible says about see that I can't be deceived I know where the Prophet said that but didn't what about the others you don't want to quote all of it do you you don't want to quote word run around and said frankly he'd get the bride so messed up they'd have to cut the work short you remember that see we want to we take what we want we don't walk the whole message we take what we want and make the rest of it our thoughts and ideas right now see then to listen to Satan's lie in the same way that Eve listened brains you and I to the same place where she was at what did he do what was her problem she wanted wisdom she wanted to understand Satan told her said that's what she's made far and that's what God said she's made far but it was just the wrong way that she manifested it right she was made to be a mother everything but it was the wrong way to make that manifest so then it's not to be so far off it's just to be one word off to doubt one word of the prophets message would that not be death as well as to doubt any part of the Bible then we're not stupid maybe a little dumb an idiot's but not totally I know when the Prophet taught things they were not correct so do you my horse rider this is one illustration all right now we don't go on that so when I say that to doubt anything the Prophet taught I'm not laying it on that form of doing good even he would make a statement one time he said the black and white will fight again and die like flies you remember that everybody had to dust at the Lord's but one day we found where the Prophet said believes the next message after then he said that was my idea well now you can prop up all you want to and say we'll look at the black and the white fighting around the world in the Prophet being right we don't have to prop up the prophets message you don't have to prove to me that the Prophet was right that's what I told brother mote when he began to talk to him but I said listen you saw these things did you solve the healings of signs and wonders the dead raised and I believe he but I said you don't have to prove that to me I see you tell me what he taught now this is a good old bad dish I said you tell me what he taught in the Word of God I won't have no problems whether or not he was a prophet what about a good old badness that we was back behind at least a message or two between us and you Pentecostals but had enough understanding of the word of God to simply put my whole talks on one basis tell me what he taught and I knew for certainty that he didn't teach the Trinity I've done been through that and got that took out of the way then brother mote said you're this you that that he said you're he's like all the rest in Trinitarians I said don't believe that no more you understand I thought the two bride of Jesus Christ was supposed to take the Word of God over everything and believe what he's saying we read it there the other day was it when it sold in prison we read it just the other day I believe that's right it was in the last message what around said this bride would prove to Satan that she would not be deceived like even now that's pretty strong in it yeah she'll be deceived like Eve was she's got a lot of problems yeah she's not gonna be deceived because she's gonna take God's Word and believe it okay because see the reason I believe it thataway I believe if a prophet is a prophet now that's for you to think about a worry about if a prophet is a prophet then he's the one the word comes to is that what a mystery in three Niner or what it is see then you and I have no right to question a prophets word upon what basis can you do well you just said he was wrong on the wild horse rider yeah and he corrected it you know what nobody else in the world correct right I don't care if it was Clarence Larkin Wavell for brother Branham I said the white horse rider with the Antichrist I didn't correct the Prophet is it true that brother Branham said a prophet stands before no one is that his word so then what took place when as I said the devil was quoting the Word of God to Eve he said she was made for the purpose he was made to produce he gave her the scriptures the Prophet said that was an oncoming thing but then we know what happened senator sin entered the picture what took place back there then brother Brennan says God put man on co-equal with him making him co-equal paragraph 132 133 power of transformation put them equal with him so they could choose what about that well he made a Miku right there now what is he talking about he gave him a choice they made a choice and when they made the choice the woman made the first wrong choice No and when she did right around since she become a great preacher because she began to tell the devil about the Word of God when run said she can be a thousand let's see let me get this one cuz I sometimes I'll make a statement and when I do you know people who come up and say wait a minute words that off the message adoption the run said and you women nothing I gave him this but they don't have to put it up said he made you as a target and certainly has been made a target out of your sisters he just does that see cuz he knows what he can do as much a devil he can deceive a woman a thousand times quicker than a man you say well you're throwing off on the women I've always been the one that stood up for the women so you going to make a balance or what you think she wasn't made any differ if she was didn't God was wrong to make her that away but why would it be that she could be a thousand times easier deceived because she ain't smartest bush men that's wonderful I'm glad you thought of that of course it's wrong but you thought of it didn't know what she was deceived but we wasn't deceived well I will remind you the Bible says that the Prophet declares it and he says this Adam knew exactly what he was doing that's what it means that he was not deceived but you know what he did walk out of the garden he did partake of the things and do and I will remind you the Bible also says that in Adam all died doesn't say you Nev in Adam all died because if Adam hadn't sold the human race see we just make a quote and we make it for a purpose of something of our own doings instead of trying to explain that we just lump it out well huh then you say something well I I don't know but I just say what the Prophet said yeah you remember he said and you go do likewise you remember that but listen think about preachers because ended the message up Sunday you can talk about free moral agency to the ministers of this message and they'll tell you real quick free moral agency is not for the bride no if I knew I'd wake up sometimes and what you listen to the preachers of this message was the biggest basics of them preach is that God chose you you didn't fuse him okay mister truth but it says that we don't deal on whosoever will that means for the world that's four denominations that's four foolish virgins is not for you and me but around them said I'm glad it didn't say William Branham he said I'm glad it said whosoever will he said called it might be another William Branham somewhere you remember that what you see we think we know all about it and then the preachers take it to the pulpit and teach their people and the people come out of it swearing by the things that are saying which is not right is that not the same thing it was in the garden to Eve they've got 99% word a lot of time but a 1% dog can kill the whole thing come on Eve was made for the purpose of being a mother what your prophet said he was commissioned multiply and replenish the earth she was promised are we quote in brother Brandon yet do we believe it that way or do we have to some way now to try to PT patter around just a little bit to kind of sideline the top instead of saying Amen what do you think you're the only ones got the truth I don't mind making statements after you make them you make a statement like that I don't mind saying I'm the only one I noticed got the truth now may I quote brother Brandon can you say that why can't you say that you're the only one this got the truth I thought the Prophet said there's only one going out of state of Georgia you know he didn't use Georgia he is Tennessee or something you know see that's how quick and smart that people are you know you say brother Brown said there's only one out of state of Georgia he didn't say Georgia he said Tennessee boy straightens you out they've got you all you know but what about the people of the message don't even believe in free moral agency when the Prophet said that was what it was it was not free moral agency what would he turn out to be let's read this one well look number one brothers on you think not 180 now number one it's called a prisoner number one is called a prisoner all right that's 1a I told no one that cerfancy learning a different one well let's read that when we got it up there's what I said it want to go see that's where brother Branham says that Satan has a knowledge so then watch what he gives that where I gave what I go now I went and that's from serpent seed Owen got the dictionary today ever ever were to look up this word what the word subtour meant it means to be smart to be crafty and the best interpretation of the of the hebrew form mah aah maja means having a true knowledge of the principles of life Satan has a true knowledge of the principles of life he knew what would mix and what would not mix he had it all down and that's what the word sub talk now he has a knowledge of the principles of life it doesn't just mean that this egg will go with this sperm right we're in a smart very intelligent age that we've went from in 50 years from a horse and buggy almost to a astronaut going through space and turned to the basis to this almost the Bible said that the imagination of man's heart was continually evil and look what we're doing it's so intelligent man until it's just amazing that's the knowledge of the principles of life Satan has that knowledge he knows what's going and taking place we just remember God is higher than that but think about it all right go ahead now let's get the 1 on the prison under the next huh it's a prisoner they were all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish to God just God justly does that because he must put ever man on the same basis or he put the wrong man he put the first man on the wrong basis if everybody's not to sign listen he put on free moral agency we're just exactly - not like Adam and Eve there's no different right and wrong sets before either one of us wrote it or not now listen but see if it's free moral agency let's see if everybody's on the same basis notice he took us without the same way then what notice if he took us without the same way did he did Adam where would you be if he didn't give you the same cause you understand that's what he said if he took us without the sign that he did Adam and he just pulled us through something said I'll save you whether you want to be saved or not then he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis because he didn't tell them that are you reading but each of us has to choose this day between death and life read what he's saying if he said now - you see that's where all of this messages in the message people you know I come into world with eternal life gets out of the other so if he says to you I'll save you whether you want to be saved or not how close is that statement because he gave Abraham an unconditional covenant do you understand so if he just pulled it through something said I'll save you where do you want to be save enough then he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis listen Adam and Eve was not put on the basis of you do anything you won't do and I'll save you anyway right Adam and Eve was put on the basis if you keep my word but if you doubt one word you're lost something happened to Abraham when you come over to him and he said I'll give you an unconditional covenant we'll get to that Adam and Eve didn't have an unconditional cover come on the first beginning two people didn't have an unconditional covenant that's what he's explaining he's explaining if he just throw it out and say I'll save you whether you want or not he said that was not what he said to Adam Adam and Eve was on a conditional covenant right if you will I will something had to take place in God to move it to Abraham and that's probably three thousand years between the Adam and Eve and Abraham so more close before he ever told anybody anything about an unconditional covenant so you'll understand what I'm talking about Lord willing Sunday you got a have a salvation in the Old Testament what is it and how did it work you not only had a Salvation in the hotel you had a place to go to to prove there was a Salvation the ones that called the bosom of Abraham think about it to each and every one of us has a choice you can't do away with the choice well he chose me I didn't choose them see you've taken that totally out of text out of thought God never had a thought he's just explaining that dark if he'd done that to you without something happening then he was wrong to Adam and Eve cuz they'd done one thing wrong got condemned we got a long ways to go but listen what happened to Eve that was her problem well she doubted God's Word okay that was original sin right but do we believe the profit that run since she began to reason she began to listen to reason Satan is successful with reasoning reasoning now so yours were we're gonna separate this little bit a little understanding what was the original sin unbelief unbelief and that God would not keep his word when he said you shall die but around said she doubted Hebrews 13:8 so that means simply that she doubted him to keep his word then are now do you believe God is able to keep his word do you doubt any of the things to profit tall can you put everything you got on what he said as I said while ago as much as you know okay I don't mind talking like that what about this fall that took place to Adam and Eve where did it take place the literal act took place in the body we understand that word did the reasoning upon God's Word come from and wort took place and where was it at see I knew I was gonna preach this about three months ago when I was in - trying to get you to see that Adam fell from eternal life what's prophecy to death but now Adam didn't die in his soul even when he was so many hundred years old I mean why we're talking about the other day it's kind of funny I got thinking about that the other day night sit down read there in Genesis and read the account and you know it started out that them fellers and that feller did 150 years old or 200 years old before he ever had a child lived to be 700 years old or something 969 for Methuselah he'd have a couple of kids maybe I mean it's courting what records now but I got to do it and I knew it would do so I got to do it I got to looking and I thought Lord and I know where this is gonna wind up and I still won't read it so I just read and I'd read about so and so live so how long and we got a child look and it'd be 150 years old and I got to looking and reading and I knew it would happen so I I just followed the line to get reading so it started out like the first one was a 175 years old fort sky was born next one 160 next 150 next 140 next 100 next it got to drop and down he's I'm just making a point we read the Word of God but do we really analyze it and think about it the mission it went on for close to 2,000 years before they ever dropped low enough to get a baby born into 80 years old come on Abraham was what 80 something when then he waited 16 what have anymore years 16 years old would it then he wound up waiting for Isaac to come along but we don't read the word to believe it we read the words it's not a figure out taste must be something wrong here I mean did it take them 150 years to learn how to have children I don't understand it it you say well what's your point my point is the same thing of the message we try to figure it out instead of just accepting it God said the tailee of that many years before they had any children well there's no need of us sitting down trying to figure it out why it happened that way we just believe it and say thank you lord why can't we believe it about the entire Word of God they remember what we taught a few months ago in read from brother Branham where brother Branham said blasphemous names that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam eternal life and he became an eternal person with God the Son of God then we went to the breach were brought around and said when Adam died he said but before he died he had a lamb know what died where was the original sin well it was unbelief where's that at we're done believe that may I quote brother Branham God chose men's heart he said Satan chose his brain her mind the right do you remember that message well I just didn't believe it brother Dale because I couldn't understand it did the Prophet say it you needs me to read it again from Blasius night where he said he breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul he said an eternal person with God that was Adam and remember in the Genesis 1:26 account that Adam and Eve was in the same theophany that's what's your prophet said in questions and answers he said he was in Adam and theophany and he said she was still up in in theophany after Adam was put in the flesh then God took a rib out of Adam made Eve and then God put that theophany in that I'm into Eve did we believe that but that's worth I just don't understand you you starting Adam and Eve it off with eternal off I didn't write the book you know what I mean by that I mean I wasn't appreciators at it I wasn't the Prophet that said it I didn't have enough sense to say it and you didn't either when a prophet would tell us that Adam and Eve fell in body from becoming eternal in human flesh but they never fail in their soul now you say they did within I want the prophets message the main thing I wanted is that God's an Indian giver I want you to explain that better unsaid he's not that he's not an Indian giver you don't give you something take it back how can he give you eternal life how could he give Adam and Eve eternal life and then take it away from them it wasn't he ternal life that he took from Adam and Eve it was the fact that they never came to eternal life in human flesh one of these days you realize why the seals got to be preached and you begin to see Redemption you're gonna line up one time you're gonna see that those seals I thought brother branham said that all Adam lost Jesus Christ Reidy is that what he said so then Jesus Christ redeemed it and made a way for us to come to a change of the body but yet we don't want to know what the seals are you know why it is go we're afraid afraid of what afraid the devil might deceive us you are already deceived when you do not want the things the Prophet brought unto us I don't care who it is you may family anybody you're already deceived when you don't want what would take you out of here to change us she didn't my point I didn't bring it out back there because I was waiting then here Adam and Eve never failed to death spiritually I want the passage I want the Bible but they failed a physical death right the prophets right he said they fell from eternal life what they never come to eternal life in flesh even Jesus the body had to be made eternal to show you where Adam fell from Adam was standing there with eternal life in his soul but a body that your prophet said that his youth was being renewed daily the de Tree of Life was standing there reminding him of that because his body was not eternal Jesus's body was not eternal it had to be made eternal in the resurrection not the saint chance whatever you want to bring you see standing back there three or four months ago knowing I'd have to come to this place to get us to think about were was to fall in even Adam it wasn't in body that would have been an attribute or a display that was not to see him the atom could not sin in his soul because it was eternal come on Adam could sin in its own code it so was eternal Jesus Christ couldn't sin in his soul because his soul was eternal no born-again believer can send in your soul that's why it's vital to understand the difference between soul and spirit it's vital to understand because only through that can you see what happened to Adam and Eve is the same thing that's happening tonight if you have eternal life your soul is sealed in with Almighty God and you can never lose that right our bodies we know he's not worth anything which you'll see then what happened in the garden I mean brother Branham said God chose the heart right he said Satan chose the head what deals through your head when I was Paul so concerned with born-again Christians had the new book or the Bible not written to sinner's and I it's written to Christians and he's talking to Christians here in Corinthians and telling them that I was struggled and said it's been foolishness to the world and the thing was said through that and I've tried to bring the word to people he said a bride he said it wouldn't be deceived as Eve was deceived through the subtlety now is that not the same thing that the Prophet said he said this bride would prove to Satan that she would not fall for Satan's lie somebody is going to stand and believe it so we begin to reason words reasoning at what you see here is where we stand in the critical situation and yet I've been ridiculed for trying to explain something that's very serious the Prophet told in his early ministry basically this time here in are related basically divided into our early ministry he thought a three round person body soul and spirit that's good go on check it out I've got him laying you're the only reader but in it when he comes in along into the opening of the seals and coming on through after really is when the quotes become to develop he preaches a try on being as body spirit and soul well I don't make no difference why is it two people of this message your two so people all told him said the soul is just the nature of the spirit and I challenge anybody on that to show me where right around and said the soul is just the nature of the spirit he didn't say it he said the soul is the nature of the spirit he said your technical plenty technical when my life is involved I'm plenty technical if you say it's just that this means it's nothing if you don't make no difference his early ministry I ask you to go back in the read let's pull that up let's do it brothers because a lot of people's never seen it they've never studied the message from a thought to where they could see that a prophet in the way he would teach things until the word opened was brother branham wrong when he was teaching body soul and spirit when later he taught body spirit and soul now before you jump up and run off and people on the internet and do it just remember one time brother branham always taught her trying being has three parts number one is a body the CTA's feeling smelling here number two whatever you call it spirit or soul he always taught it as memory reason conscience affections etc he always taught the sinner realm of mankind has to be the occupation of the holy spirit or God dwelling you he never changed his message so he didn't have to correct it he said well you can't find what brought around correct is that that's what I mean whether he knew the way that happened or what I have no problem I just know for a certain and I can go back in the 50s and talk about her trying being when the Prophet would call him body so second rent spirit sent around I can shout hallelujah because he'll always explain the census he always explained the census of the body the outside ring she takes field smelling here you always explain that second rim as memory reason conscience affections etc he always talked the center part of mankind as the place where God would come and live what do you think I was quoting from their will ago when brother Adam talks about God's approaches to heart Satan's approach is the head has taken from 1961 101 revelations chapter 461 okay Intervale 1965 excuse me he's talking about the outer rim to enter him and he calls the second rim that's what he says right down in the heart in the center of the heart there's a little compartment where there's not even a blood cell in it it's not in the animal heart only in the human heart and they say it's the occupation or the occupant of the soul the soul lives in the heart he knew exactly what he's talking about but yet you go backwards and forth the soul spirit and body so but that's not important where's your born-again experience is it in your body not exactly is it in your spirit you can be anointed every day you live in your spirit with the baptism of the Holy Spirit in dying go to hell is that the words of the Prophet but he said that soul bless Venus names God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul he says there a soul that can't die you see the reason people don't want this I've done it in seven he's doing it now because you destroy the doctrine of the two souls it's destroyed by the Word of God that shows you the body and the second realm is the spirit realm reasoning memory conscious in the soul is the center in the place of God the two sold people said he give you a new soul Ezekiel says what I know word words new heart in your spirit brother Brennan said that I need to hold his spirit he said then I put my life in you and my soul in you he said now you got eternal life you see Church the little bitty things is what spoiling the vine of the people of this message what does it matter okay you gonna baptize father son Holy Ghost next time what does it matter it's in the Word of God right I told you we get down to an that part of it being look what he gets on the rapture message number nine if you don't pull that up look here you're a trying being you are inside this little fella here it's the soul he's coming inside out what's it the next is the spirit and next is the body you got five senses in the body to contact earthly home you don't contact the rest of it you got five senses of the Spirit there love conscious and so forth but in here is where you live that's what you gon that's why you can be anointed on your spirit and still be lost with the born-again experience we'll get to it later look at the next one number ten god of this evil age that man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses or five senses brother inside man is the spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscious and loved and so forth yeah outside man see taste feel smell in here but the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will your free will read the profit you can accept what the devil says or accept what God says in that'll determine what spirit is in there if it's the Spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world jesus said you loved the world as the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even entered this inner part inner part he said was the soul see why you can be anointed I know they don't have this one but the message that North it not paragraph 123 124 you talking about the endless he said I don't know what I can call him right or not at first I know is all conscious what watch what he says no conscious livery and he's correcting his own self no watch there is five inlets to the spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you cannot reason with your physical being because reasoning doesn't see taste feel smelling hear reason is what you can make in your mind and if you are sleep or not if you're asleep or at you're out your body's land are dead but your spirit can still read there is five senses that controls that inside man now the life man which is the soul there is only one sense that controls that look you remember free will hold on the other and what does he say and that is free moral agency free will to choose are to reject what about it Church what what does it matter where it's so spirit of body why does it matter it matters because your word won't line up then may I quote one scripture why do you think better run late so every when he rude what at fourth well what does that one say the word divides between the joint and Amara in between the soul and the spirit you can be anointed on that spirit of reasoning and that's what he was now listen I'm gonna end with this top eve was anointed on her reasoning on her spirit realm Satan contacted that and talked to her and gave her a great understanding in her spirit realm had she listened to Adam it wouldn't have happened had she listened to her own inner being he said well why are you bringing it that way because that's exactly where we're sitting tonight you are making a choice as to whether or not you believe the Word of God blew me brother I believe there were so did Eve I'm quoting brother branham she believed everything he said that God said except what Satan began to interpret even our spirit realm became the first one to be anointed now remember Satan can anoint you that run but brother Branham didn't if it didn't divide that as much as the basis that he put the anointing as being even the genuine holy spirit how can you be anointed with the Holy Spirit and deny the word well I'm glad you thought of that may I ask you a question his weight was saying the other day about on Caiaphas standing up their high priest the Bible says the high priest is under the anointing of the time that even saw under the anointing could prophesy all kind of things happen under the anointing Caiaphas could anoint and Caiaphas spoke the word he said it was necessary read your Bible that one died for the sins of the people instead of all the people who died that was exactly the Old Testament prophecy the calf was said Balaam anointed he's writing his writing is in the Bible baylin's words is in the Bible the anointing of the Holy Spirit was on Eve to teach her you say but God would deliberately do it no the anointing was on her that she couldn't tell the difference between when Satan was talking to her or when God was talking to her you tell me come on we done gone too far she couldn't tell the difference why brother Brown says she still thinks she's right why because she's anointed he said anointed with a genuine holy spirit and still be lost that's why Catholics remember what way were talking about see John was told when he was in the wilderness when you see the Holy Ghost descending but the key was is what he told John he said and remaining on him John walks after her one day and he hears koffice he sees him in the temple he's walking around watching him cough there's an anointing of the Spirit of God Caiaphas is prophesy all kinds of things is happening under koffice the guy that killed Jesus John says what's going on the guard said but John don't you remember what I told you I told you there'd be anointings I said I told you the key he said the one that the Holy Spirit descends on and remains you come on him and remained only we'll know gutsy now culture prophet said the anointing left he said anointing left he didn't say God left him his spirit never left out of him it was the anointing the priests just what left him because that was the anointing they come on him on the River Jordan to start his ministry come on we got it right John looks and he says caucus is confusing me but God said remember now watch and he saw that one down at the River Jordan he said I see him day after day and said that same anointing he turned around and he said behold the lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world I've made my statement dairy stands see the bride you think Satan don't anoint the people of this message he said yeah but the Bible - you know the Bible the Bible plainly tells you two things about a prophet one if that prophet comes and tells you things you better hear him because I sent him - he says if that prophet tells you something and it comes to pies listen he takes you to another God he said don't believe him now read the rest of the story was a resident said he said because I sent him among you to try you that's what people can't get that straight they think there's there's the anointings and the shoutings in the glory hallelujah is the word of God Brian brought yet somebody just sit down and simply talking to you about God see they hate that but I'll ask you to do one thing and I'm not against emotions you say I am you're a liar and you'll answer to God because I'm a more emotional than anybody in this building you just don't never see it because I don't want nothing built on emotions I want it built on the Word of God there is emotion that goes for the Word of God but give me the word first see Eve didn't run around and said didn't wait if God was going to bring it would not have brought it and talked to her and told her the truth free moral agency puts us a right to choose the soul is where the choosing is from because you can't choose from your body you always do wrong you can't choose in your spirit room you'll always go wrong you understand what I'm saying Eve then in her soul was still pure but her spirit got anointed of the devil and she called it the Holy Spirit I asked you to go home and read anointed ones at the end time and see if your prophet did not explain that as being that even the Holy Spirit would come on you is to try you to see if you'll stand on the word you said well it's not important to me to understand body spirit so I don't care what it is you just said it you don't care what it is I've made myself plain for 30 or 40 years on that subject brother branham did not have to come back and correct that because he always told five senses for the first room five senses for the second room one sense for the center realm he never had to change it because he was always right no I'll tell you this and we'll stop on it because see there's no difference in the word spirit take you Strong's Concordance and try to find a word spirit in the New Testament and you'll find it has only one definition they don't matter worse the spirit of the devil whether it's the spirit of this or spirit of that it's got the same writing that's one man has always been deceived on the body the spirit and the soul you know that before I came into this message I heard a doctrine you ever heard this one that man never had a soul until the law came I listened to a man at work explain it after the service he goofed up by asking me what I thought some way and I said well you saying that man didn't have a soul until the law that's over Exodus you know part of it that I said according to my understanding the Bible said it he breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he become a living soul he stopped he said I never thought of that but did he change his teaching I doubt it does he thought he had beautiful story he thought he had wisdom that there wouldn't no soul of mankind that the law brought in knowledge of sin that's exactly right but there's no salvation in the law either law only condemns you what about it when they don't matter body spirit and so I guess it don't matter about father-son oligos Lord Jesus Christ those are both in the Bible you're just too sarcastic I'll agree with you I still love the Lord and I try my best and I've tried for 50 years almost to preach the truth this little group of people for us to be able to stand on God's Word and say thank you somebody come along quotes you something just go back and listen listen to the Prophet in your mind and he'll just come back home brothers is this you'll just come right around in your mind and you'll hear brother Branham say but that's not right you hear him say Christ is the word that's revealed Christ is the word that's revealed he was body spirit and soul Almighty God is what's your prophet said about him he said in body he was a man he said in soul it was God in another time he said in body he was a man he said in spirit he was God so who was that little one laying in the cradle brother Bobby said use it the other day we wrote a random said it the fullness of the Godhead bodily laid right there in that cradle if he his father son Holy Ghost then we don't have to worry about him being body spirit and soul Almighty God this day well we got [Music] 103 anybody helping anybody have a need [Music] the brother Dale how are we gonna ever know the difference [Music] by reading God's Word by listening to the Prophet yes only our sacrifice my [Music] you did maybe and now since we pray as you you anybody have an aid [Music] the Bible says the soul that sinneth that soul will die and the Bible doesn't say the spirit within us filled up you realize that Satan still has the same Inlet tonight to you and me that he had to Adam and Eve in the garden and he can come and try to make us reason sacrificing you come quoting the word [Music] he looks so beautiful happy street every you [Music] oh we Perkin what the Lord's got in storage [Music] you may understand against all denominational doctrines an idea and stand on God's Word what a wonderful time Oh here's your [Music] you can be was and how Jesus Firoz to you father we thank you for denying we pray that what's been said this but worthy because you know what we struggle to try to bring it got a line up thoughts to get into work we could understand Lord we just ask you you go home with us and then let us see let's walk in the light of your loving grace to know that we've had a message what a wonderful message delivered and the e only with that message where the bride be able to withstand Satan
