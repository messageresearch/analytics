[8:44] and we thank you in Jesus name amen
[8:50] Matthew 13 we'll start verse 18.
[8:58] he therefore the parable of the sower
[9:01] when anyone here at the word of the
[9:03] kingdom and understandeth it not then
[9:06] cometh the wicked one and catch his way
[9:08] that which was sown in his heart
[9:10] this is he which receives seed by the
[9:13] wayside and remember he's explained in
[9:15] it
[9:16] but he that received the seed into Stony
[9:19] places the same is he that heareth the
[9:22] word and the none are at once
[9:24] with joy receiveth yet hath he not root
[9:28] in himself
[9:29] but do it for a while
[9:31] for when tribulation of persecution
[9:33] arises because of the word by and by He
[9:35] Is offended he also that receives seed
[9:38] among the Thorns is he that heareth the
[9:40] word and cure and the care of this world
[9:43] and the deceitfulness of riches choke
[9:46] the word and he becometh unfruitful
[9:49] but he that receive a seed into
[9:52] the good ground is he that heareth the
[9:54] word and understandeth it
[9:57] which also bears fruit
[9:59] bringeth for us which also bears fruit
[10:02] and bring us forth
[10:04] some and a hundred fold some 60 some 30.
[10:08] all right go to verse 36.
[10:13] then Jesus sent the multitude away and
[10:15] went into the house and disciples came
[10:17] unto him saying declaring to us the
[10:19] parable of the tires of the field and he
[10:22] answered and said unto them
[10:23] he that here he he that saweth the good
[10:26] seed is the son of man now remember that
[10:30] he's the only sower of the seed we are
[10:34] just vessels to be used
[10:37] all right the field is the world the
[10:40] good seed are the children of the
[10:41] Kingdom but the tires where the children
[10:43] of the wicked one
[10:45] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[10:47] the Harvest is the end of the world and
[10:49] the reapers are the angel
[10:51] and therefore the tires are gathered and
[10:53] burned in the fire so shall it be at the
[10:56] end of this world
[10:58] the son of man shall send forth his
[11:00] angels and they Shall Gather out of his
[11:03] kingdom all that offendeth and then
[11:05] which
[11:06] do iniquity
[11:09] and she'll cast him into a furnace of
[11:11] fire there shall be wailing in Nashville
[11:13] teeth then shall the righteous shine
[11:15] forth as a son in the Kingdom of their
[11:18] father
[11:18] who have ears to hear
[11:21] let him hear you may be seated the Lord
[11:23] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[11:26] word
[11:32] now we've been trying to cover
[11:37] the uh
[11:39] many different
[11:41] angles are points of view as you would
[11:44] call it
[11:45] uh or illustrations
[11:48] of you know the Bible and the way in the
[11:51] prophet's message and bringing it down
[11:54] and the last parts we were speaking of
[11:57] was how that the the same Bible that
[12:01] speaks of the bridegroom
[12:03] speaks of the Bride because it has
[12:06] compound meanings to the scriptures you
[12:09] know
[12:10] and showing it all right and then how
[12:14] she is to be the fullness of the godhead
[12:17] bodily
[12:19] now that was an illustration of going
[12:21] from here partial realization to perfect
[12:25] realization and coming forth
[12:28] and remember that the point we've always
[12:30] made when we talk about the bride be in
[12:33] the fullness of the godhead bodily or
[12:35] when we start in more this afternoon on
[12:38] the bride being the son of man remember
[12:40] that we're not talking about just the
[12:43] end time
[12:45] you know we're talking about uh the
[12:48] entire bride all the way down Through
[12:50] the Ages because you'd be leaving Parts
[12:53] out of it
[12:54] but now think about it
[12:57] see the reason we covered if you
[12:58] remember in the point of saying that the
[13:01] bride is the fullness or the godhead
[13:03] bodily that's the quotes your Prophet
[13:05] gave
[13:06] all right and to me that the reason is
[13:09] that
[13:10] the bride is the same material
[13:14] coming from the same source
[13:17] and even is eternal with him according
[13:20] to power page 151 of the church age book
[13:23] somewhere in church age
[13:25] it's the same source
[13:29] now watch that in a minute
[13:31] and you'll see why it's so valuable to
[13:33] try to hold her
[13:36] and him together as one source
[13:40] remember that was the argument at nicaea
[13:43] on 325 A.D not whether they was three
[13:46] gods or or whatever the argument whether
[13:49] was whether Jesus was God or another
[13:53] source
[13:54] you know
[13:56] all right which in when they took him
[13:57] and and trying to decide whether it was
[14:00] another source
[14:01] then that brought in the doctrine that
[14:04] would later develop into trinitarianism
[14:08] and it would would come forth see to try
[14:10] to make you something different from him
[14:13] now we're talking about the new birth in
[14:16] your soul not talking about you and I as
[14:18] people right
[14:21] as people we're people
[14:23] and even where we were reading of the
[14:25] children of the kingdom and and all like
[14:27] that everybody wants to take that as
[14:29] some kind of serpent seed you know this
[14:32] away and you and I a great seed this way
[14:34] just remember we were all born kin folks
[14:38] to the devil
[14:40] all right all Prophet or whoever he is
[14:43] he said was hybrid
[14:45] that's his words all right and see in
[14:48] being that then there's nothing good in
[14:50] you and I at all
[14:52] the children of the kingdom are the are
[14:55] the people of God right and the children
[14:57] of the tares are the wicked one is the
[15:01] ones who reject
[15:03] God you know
[15:05] and in the way of becoming into the
[15:07] family of God not dealing with whether
[15:10] it's serpent seat or not because we're
[15:12] all born kin folks to the devil all
[15:15] right we're all born between
[15:17] Satan
[15:19] and Eve
[15:21] all right now it doesn't say the prophet
[15:23] didn't say between the Beast
[15:25] he said between Satan and Eve all right
[15:27] see putting it all together as one all
[15:30] right but remember now that we've got to
[15:32] hold the point though
[15:34] that new birth that you have that
[15:36] eternal life that you have
[15:39] is
[15:41] the life of God because it's only one
[15:43] eternal
[15:45] all right
[15:46] there's only one eternal life there's
[15:48] only one Eternal God there's only one
[15:50] God so then when you get away and try to
[15:52] get into the to your trinitarianism you
[15:56] really get confused in the Bible and
[15:58] you'll miss the whole point so watch
[16:01] that now as we go along this morning
[16:03] because really this is a a kind of an
[16:06] inset message
[16:07] to prepare us to think about
[16:12] how the bride the prophet said is the
[16:15] son of man
[16:17] uh you say well that's I just don't
[16:19] believe that well then you're going to
[16:21] have to reject what your Prophet says so
[16:23] I'll let you do that
[16:25] you know I'll just read it that's why
[16:27] when we went to those with the bride be
[16:29] in the fullness of the godhead bodily we
[16:32] even ran off all of you the copies of
[16:34] where that we was to read it and those
[16:37] on the internet are reading it anyway
[16:38] and seeing it and they're capable of
[16:41] downloading it to understand so it's not
[16:44] what I'm saying
[16:46] but it is a point that I preached this
[16:48] in 1969 the first sermon that I preached
[16:52] in this message was that the Bride of
[16:55] Jesus Christ is the son of man
[16:57] right now as we get to that point you'll
[17:00] see what I'm doing but hold a point in
[17:02] your mind
[17:04] that the the that he's not one
[17:07] now we're talking about the New Birth
[17:09] now not talking about human beings
[17:10] everybody understand the new birth makes
[17:13] us the children of God The Offspring of
[17:15] God in our soul
[17:17] all right then there's no difference in
[17:19] that eternal life that you have than the
[17:22] eternal life that God is because that is
[17:25] God's life
[17:26] right
[17:27] see then that way then he and I are one
[17:30] I in you as Wade was talking about
[17:32] Wednesday night and you and me
[17:34] the I and you can you understand because
[17:37] that's the holy ghost coming in you but
[17:39] then when he Jesus said and you and me
[17:42] that means there has to be some part of
[17:44] me
[17:46] yeah that was in him
[17:49] all right or else he said it wrong all
[17:52] right so then the only part I know
[17:54] that's in me that could be in him would
[17:58] be the new birth that I receive you know
[18:02] all right the eternal life see then that
[18:04] makes us the same source so what speaks
[18:07] of the Bride I mean the bridegrooms he
[18:09] speaks of the Bride
[18:11] he speaks of him being Eternal he speaks
[18:13] of us being eternal
[18:15] he speaks with him being the fullness of
[18:16] the godhead bodily right and then it
[18:19] would be speaking of you and I to be the
[18:21] fullness of the godhead bodily but not
[18:23] just the end time that's what I want to
[18:25] divide a little bit this morning
[18:28] to make sure that you understand
[18:30] what I'm saying because if you don't
[18:34] you'll miss the whole point all right
[18:36] but now remember the only difference
[18:39] between him and her brother random says
[18:42] is the Corporal body
[18:45] now the difference in him being here now
[18:48] or whether he was back under then is the
[18:51] Corporal body
[18:52] amen all right because it's the same
[18:54] eternal life
[18:56] it's just in a mini-membered body right
[18:58] called the bride of Christ all right and
[19:01] that whole body is him what him made
[19:05] manifest right all right now see then we
[19:09] are the attributes of God made manifest
[19:13] in our lives the new birth is is the
[19:16] attribute of God the Eternal life all
[19:19] right
[19:21] see see then she then is him trying to
[19:25] get a little off of the bringing it from
[19:27] the former messages
[19:29] and what I'll do probably next weekend
[19:32] excuse me this coming weekend
[19:35] Vernon then the next weekend I'll
[19:38] probably be still on this and we will
[19:40] get down to some questions and answers
[19:42] so you got a couple of weeks to write
[19:44] down things you know to to do and I wish
[19:47] you would study these things that's why
[19:48] I give them to you all right but see
[19:51] what she is is him made manifest
[19:56] right
[19:57] there's nothing good in you and I
[19:58] whatsoever
[20:00] period whether it be Body Spirit and
[20:03] soul it's all lost doomed and on the way
[20:06] to destruction right
[20:09] but yet he comes and gives us eternal
[20:11] life all right then it's his own life
[20:13] living in us as Paul said the life that
[20:16] I now live in the flesh I live by the
[20:18] faith is the Son of God all right see
[20:21] then that new birth brings us to the
[20:23] place
[20:24] to where that we can be as we covered
[20:27] last
[20:28] Services a many membered body
[20:33] that would be his offspring
[20:37] his children
[20:39] see why it's so important to get the new
[20:42] birth
[20:43] see why it's so important for you to
[20:45] have the new birth
[20:46] because without the new birth you don't
[20:48] have eternal life
[20:50] right he said well brother Dale I
[20:52] thought he the the new birth was just
[20:54] believing well then wherever you got
[20:55] Bible for that
[20:57] the disciples believed three and a half
[20:59] years went through a lot and still
[21:01] didn't get the Holy Ghost Jesus told
[21:03] Peter said after you're converted
[21:06] strengthen the brethren
[21:08] you see it's like Wade was bringing out
[21:09] Wednesday you know that those Old
[21:12] Testament Saints he could not have
[21:14] eternal life
[21:15] why because Jesus Christ had not been
[21:17] given
[21:18] the life that was in him see could only
[21:21] anoint them in the Old Testament because
[21:25] there was no way to enter into mankind
[21:27] back there and then remember we were
[21:30] bringing out that into many membered
[21:33] body and that's why we reflect back to
[21:36] the son of man and read it again as
[21:38] being the sower of the seed then he
[21:41] actually sowed
[21:44] his bride
[21:46] that's what he was doing while he was
[21:48] preaching
[21:49] he was preaching to the disciples right
[21:53] you know to anybody here but mainly to
[21:55] the disciples why where they would take
[21:57] that
[22:00] and they would sow that same seed
[22:03] right and see then them sowing that seed
[22:07] would be him in them
[22:10] still sowing all right so then he's not
[22:13] he's not stopped creating
[22:17] because he created his own
[22:19] bride
[22:21] right and he still as a member of the
[22:24] Bride is coming in today of somebody
[22:26] beginning the new New Birth being born
[22:28] again God is still creating
[22:31] he stopped the physical creation back
[22:34] Yonder
[22:35] but yet he's still creating now his many
[22:38] membered body all right now
[22:41] he said I want to make sure as I've said
[22:44] it before over and over and I've done
[22:46] said it one time I'll say it again make
[22:48] sure you don't misunderstand and get the
[22:52] idea that we are trying to make this end
[22:56] time bride you know the part we are to
[23:00] be something different from the rest of
[23:02] the
[23:03] Body of Christ
[23:05] it's just a point of where we are
[23:08] and what he has chosen us for
[23:11] right
[23:12] see because of specific purpose
[23:15] all right
[23:16] we've covered how that the bride of
[23:19] Christ is the fullness of the godhead
[23:21] bodily
[23:23] and if the prophet said he's not
[23:25] complete without
[23:26] you
[23:27] all right so then it is his choosing it
[23:31] is not what we choose
[23:34] we're not trying to pump up Prime up or
[23:38] make some kind of a special Doctrine
[23:41] to try to make us different that's what
[23:43] I keep emphasizing it
[23:45] we are the we're built on a foundation
[23:47] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being
[23:50] the Chief Cornerstone all right so
[23:52] whatever the disciples taught we must
[23:54] teach that
[23:56] or we're not
[23:58] in the word and we're not the children
[23:59] of the Kingdom if we don't hold it
[24:01] together in the word all right see then
[24:05] doing it
[24:07] you run into trouble because it's hard
[24:10] to describe how that way God does things
[24:15] you see he started his church off
[24:18] on the day of Pentecost
[24:20] with 120 in the upper room
[24:23] and those were Sons and Daughters of God
[24:25] capable of writing the scriptures
[24:30] right
[24:31] he didn't give anything to novices or
[24:34] little kids you know because what kind
[24:36] of writings would you have if you had
[24:38] little children right might have better
[24:39] than some of us adults but not not the
[24:42] point
[24:43] he he used his church
[24:46] you know to write
[24:49] his writings to send it to mankind all
[24:52] right and in doing that then
[24:55] they were not anything different from
[24:57] what he was that's why Paul could say
[25:00] that if anybody comes and says anything
[25:03] different Galatians 1 8. he said even an
[25:07] angel
[25:09] he accredited that the angel brought him
[25:12] the Revelation right
[25:13] the mystery was brought to him by an
[25:15] Angel we believe that all right and he
[25:18] said even if an angel comes to say
[25:21] anything different he said let them be
[25:23] accursed
[25:26] I just don't believe it well
[25:29] you're the one that's cursing yourself
[25:32] now not me
[25:33] because I don't have no problems with
[25:35] that
[25:36] I've never tried to cast anybody into
[25:38] hell I've always tried to dig people out
[25:40] of it
[25:41] you know all right now but think about
[25:45] it
[25:46] then thinking about the ages as they
[25:49] come down
[25:51] and how did he starts off with a great
[25:53] church but it goes down
[25:57] all right
[25:58] it goes into the ground at niceea
[26:01] and then has to start coming back out in
[26:03] Luther you know Wesley Pentecost
[26:08] and then coming back into our age where
[26:10] we're at all right and those things are
[26:13] divided in uh the point but remember one
[26:17] thing
[26:19] it's the same God
[26:24] because he stands in the midst according
[26:26] to the Book of Revelation the midst of
[26:28] the seven golden candlesticks which
[26:30] means his presence is just as present in
[26:33] one age as it is the other age right
[26:38] and see people say oh no he wasn't down
[26:40] through there well then you've lost your
[26:42] even your carnality of human thinking
[26:44] because he he specifically stated that
[26:48] he was in the midst of the seven golden
[26:51] Candlestick well that would if you're
[26:53] going to take your carnal terminology
[26:55] that would make him greater in the
[26:58] middle
[27:01] right
[27:02] you see where terminologies go down to
[27:04] the door when we get to thinking that
[27:07] would put him in the middle greater than
[27:09] anywhere else but why not just let him
[27:11] be that he's a holy ghost in every age
[27:15] Prophet preached a message of that in
[27:17] the church ages right
[27:18] same holy ghost in every age it was the
[27:21] word
[27:22] that was eat down and it had to be
[27:25] restored back all right and what you do
[27:28] is we get through into the message later
[27:29] and covering it it was the son of man
[27:34] that sowed deceived it was the son of
[27:37] man
[27:39] that came forth in the early church he
[27:41] said Don wait a minute the Son of God
[27:42] well we'll get to that in a minute so
[27:44] just holds your point
[27:46] the son of man the prophet on its arise
[27:48] in the sun more this afternoon he said
[27:52] who is that son of man he said in the
[27:55] beginning was the word
[27:57] all right
[27:58] son of man refers to God manifest in
[28:01] flesh
[28:03] whereas Son of God refers to Holy Spirit
[28:06] dwelling in you and I not two different
[28:09] gods
[28:12] and it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal
[28:16] you know the Son of God to reveal the
[28:19] son of man is that sensible
[28:21] because the only what if 45 Christ is
[28:24] the mystery of God revealed I believe
[28:25] that's right the Holy Ghost is the only
[28:27] revealer of the word
[28:30] see I can't reveal it to you brother
[28:32] Branham couldn't reveal it to you Jesus
[28:34] rode around and said said my own life
[28:36] didn't reveal that unto thee
[28:39] but my Father which is in heaven see the
[28:42] Holy Ghost the only revealer of the word
[28:43] all right just as the son of man is the
[28:46] only sower of the seed
[28:48] all right but we're talking about coming
[28:50] back to the original seed that went into
[28:54] the ground
[28:55] all right
[28:56] coming back to the son of man is where
[28:58] we're we're going to be dealing with in
[29:00] a few for a few messages
[29:03] and to do that let's get something that
[29:05] will help us and then clarify some
[29:08] points and and you know but let's think
[29:11] about something
[29:13] we're very familiar with the word and
[29:15] we'll get to it in a little bit and
[29:19] brother random says that
[29:21] he's a dispensationalist
[29:24] then he says he's not much on being a
[29:26] dispensationalist
[29:27] so I think that needs to be clarified
[29:29] because of what he's saying because to
[29:32] me it's a great understanding
[29:35] but now dispensationalist
[29:39] is not in the dictionary
[29:42] you go into Google and pull it up and
[29:45] it'll tell you what dispensationalist
[29:47] means in the form but it's not a word
[29:50] it's a modern form of word
[29:53] you know bringing it more down to the
[29:55] days that we're living
[29:57] but see a dispensation is what we're
[29:59] talking about
[30:01] there was a dispensation in the Old
[30:03] Testament a dispensation of the New
[30:05] Testament all right
[30:07] we'll read in a minute that's where
[30:08] dispensation of the Son of God
[30:09] dispensation son of man dispensation son
[30:12] of David
[30:14] all right
[30:16] a dispensation then is very valuable if
[30:20] you understand what it means
[30:23] right
[30:25] because if you don't then you're going
[30:27] right back
[30:30] now watch my point
[30:34] we don't believe in a god of the Old
[30:36] Testament and a different god of the new
[30:38] do we
[30:40] no we believe that Jehovah the old is
[30:44] the Jesus of the new it's the same God
[30:47] all right so now when you're covering
[30:49] dispensations remember my point of what
[30:53] I'm driving at is I believe is what the
[30:54] prophet is saying that you can't have
[30:58] two different gods
[31:02] it's the same God
[31:05] the only thing it is is just something
[31:08] not different there was a Salvation in
[31:11] the Old Testament
[31:13] right
[31:14] right under the dispensation of the law
[31:18] there was salvation all right there's
[31:20] salvation under the new but remember
[31:25] Jesus Christ stood in the Middle with
[31:27] his arms stretched out both ways to
[31:29] cover the old and the new he had to pay
[31:31] the price for the old as well as the new
[31:33] there's no salvation in the Old
[31:35] Testament without Jesus Christ
[31:38] right so then when we're looking at it
[31:41] remember keep it the same Source keep it
[31:45] the same person being revealed
[31:47] and then you'll see why the prophet
[31:49] would make these statements so let's go
[31:51] ahead and we'll just pick up something
[31:52] look at number two
[31:56] and we'll start from that number one is
[31:58] I give it to you paragraph or page 150.
[32:01] he said it's the same source
[32:04] we're Eternal with him
[32:06] God manifested into many member body all
[32:08] right now watch
[32:11] this is
[32:14] paragraph 521 of question of questions
[32:17] and answers on Hebrews 2.
[32:21] he said Gentile dispensation
[32:24] and he's quoting the scripture we'll get
[32:26] to it in just a minute and Luke all
[32:28] right
[32:28] and it doesn't say Gentile dispensation
[32:31] in Luke
[32:33] you're watching you you'll get the point
[32:35] of what I'll be driving him
[32:37] sitting by the Gentiles until the you
[32:40] know wall to be trodden down and I'll
[32:41] Gentile dispensation now you people that
[32:44] don't believe in dispensations what
[32:46] about that the Gentile dispensation
[32:48] would be finished and when the Gentile
[32:50] dispensation is finished the time of the
[32:53] Gentile just finished
[32:54] all right
[32:55] now
[32:57] he's talking about believing in
[32:59] dispensations
[33:04] when I watched in a minute when we refer
[33:06] to other quotes it sounds like he
[33:09] doesn't believe in dispensation
[33:13] see I believe this is very valuable or I
[33:15] wouldn't be covering it
[33:17] all right
[33:19] I I I've got too much to go on down to
[33:21] preach
[33:22] I believe this is valuable for you and I
[33:25] to keep it in the right order so I go
[33:27] ahead now let's pick up number 2A and
[33:30] just read it because we'll read the
[33:31] scripture
[33:32] and if you'll look at the scripture
[33:34] you'll catch the point of what I'm
[33:36] driving out
[33:39] because the scripture doesn't say in the
[33:42] dispensation of the Gentiles
[33:45] it's not dark
[33:47] all right
[33:48] Luke 21 24 says and they shall fall by
[33:52] the edge of the sword and shall be led
[33:54] away captivity in all nations and
[33:56] Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
[33:58] Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles
[34:01] be fulfilled
[34:05] he doesn't use the word dispensation
[34:08] use times
[34:10] record that
[34:12] record that in your mentality
[34:15] all right in First Corinthians 9 and 17
[34:18] it says for if I do that which do this
[34:21] thing willingly I have a reward
[34:25] but if against my will a dispensation of
[34:27] the Gospel is committed unto me
[34:31] Paul is using the word dispensation all
[34:34] right
[34:35] Ephesians 1 10 says that in the
[34:37] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[34:39] might gather together all in one all
[34:41] things in Christ both which are in
[34:43] heaven and which are in the Earth
[34:45] all right Ephesians 3 and 2 says if we
[34:49] have if ye have heard of the
[34:50] dispensation of the grace of God which
[34:52] has given me to you word all right
[34:55] Colossians 1 25. whereof I am a made a
[35:00] minister according to the dispensation
[35:02] of God which is given to me for you to
[35:05] fulfill the word of God now
[35:08] dispensations
[35:11] okay
[35:13] we've done used one up here where he's
[35:15] talking about a dispensation look at
[35:16] number three
[35:18] all right this has taken 64. the future
[35:21] home
[35:22] and he's talking about the times in the
[35:25] coming down remember that the sevens
[35:26] Remember come up to the sevens and then
[35:28] he makes this statement
[35:30] says what are you going to do now you're
[35:32] a dispensationalist which I am I believe
[35:36] that God is too
[35:38] you're running out of dispensations
[35:40] types all right so he says I'm a
[35:43] dispensational he says and God is too
[35:45] God is a dispensationalist
[35:48] and he said I am too but then why would
[35:51] he come up now to
[35:52] we're going to give you the definition
[35:53] just a second and try to defied
[35:56] something where that you'll see what it
[35:58] means to believe in one true and living
[36:00] God
[36:03] you know I mean to a trinitarian he
[36:05] don't care how many gods you see
[36:08] right
[36:10] but the Bible would speak in the Book of
[36:12] Revelation of one God sitting on the
[36:14] throne right
[36:15] one God riding a horse one God doing
[36:19] this or that or the other the whole
[36:21] Bible
[36:21] see it's very valuable because
[36:25] see you you get all tied up in trying to
[36:27] study your scriptures
[36:29] but if you keep it to the one true and
[36:30] living God you got it right
[36:33] all right
[36:34] now watch what he says
[36:36] and the message says we would see Jesus
[36:38] number three a I just put three of them
[36:41] together in it so go ahead and pull up
[36:43] 3A and we'll roll it pretty fast
[36:45] this is taken from sirs we would see
[36:47] Jesus 57 12 11. now we're in the last
[36:51] days when Jesus at the closing of the
[36:53] Gentile dispensation
[36:55] and once I'm not much of a
[36:58] dispensationalist
[37:00] now he just said twice that he was a
[37:03] dispensationalist and God was a
[37:05] dispensationalist
[37:09] that's what I'm telling you you try to
[37:11] look up that word dispensationalist and
[37:13] you dictionary
[37:15] this is more terminologies of the last
[37:18] days aren't I'm not much of a
[37:20] dispensation now watch but I know that
[37:22] there is a dispensation of the Gentile
[37:24] Jesus said so in Matthew 24.
[37:29] now why would he say he's not much of a
[37:31] dispensationalist when he says Jesus is
[37:33] God is a dispensation he said he
[37:36] believed in dispensation
[37:39] what's this point go to the next one
[37:41] which is
[37:42] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[37:44] and forever 58 207 E 33. this is the
[37:50] ending of the Gentile dispensation
[37:53] I'm not much of a dispensationalist but
[37:56] the Bible speaks of it that the Gentiles
[37:58] have come to their end
[38:01] yeah go to the next just to get these
[38:03] out of the way
[38:04] the message to the lady you see in
[38:06] church
[38:07] 58
[38:09] 609 I think it is Eve 9. this text of
[38:15] Revelation here is a message to the
[38:17] latest in age which I truly believe that
[38:19] not being a dispensationalist exactly
[38:24] but yet I believe that we're at the end
[38:26] of the Gentile dispensation that was
[38:29] spoke of
[38:30] now what's this
[38:34] what is the whole point
[38:37] I bring these out because see you you
[38:40] bring out something you you bring up and
[38:42] you read and people out on the internet
[38:44] you know and maybe some of you sitting
[38:46] there
[38:47] when I say that brother random is a
[38:49] dispensationalist and I say God is this
[38:55] I know where he says that he's not a
[38:57] dispensationalist
[38:59] and you don't cut off everything I'm
[39:01] talking about
[39:03] and you don't hear nothing I'm talking
[39:05] about and the rest of the message means
[39:07] nothing
[39:12] so I like to give both of them
[39:15] because you know my way of doing that
[39:18] I believe they will both come together
[39:20] to reveal a beautiful picture
[39:24] that we must have
[39:27] if not we're quoting each other as a
[39:30] Jehovah Witness reading room that will
[39:33] you read that and I'll read this and but
[39:35] they're different
[39:36] you know
[39:38] but I got a quote that's not getting
[39:40] down your quote I got a scripture donkey
[39:42] or something like a
[39:45] you know where it says baptize the name
[39:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the name of
[39:49] Jesus Christ but I've got a scripture
[39:51] where Jesus said father son Holy Ghost
[39:55] you know you're arguing scriptures
[40:00] but you're arguing over something that
[40:03] is a beautiful revelation
[40:09] then when Jesus said baptize in the name
[40:10] of the father and the son of the Holy
[40:12] Ghost
[40:13] you baptized in the name of the Lord
[40:14] Jesus Christ
[40:17] that's why it says siren
[40:19] Acts 2 Jesus Christ
[40:22] then you go over in the scripture and
[40:23] says Lord
[40:24] our lord Jesus all right
[40:27] why because it brings out a beautiful
[40:29] picture
[40:32] into view
[40:34] now if a prophet would say I believe in
[40:37] a dispensation
[40:38] and God believes in a dispensation
[40:42] and we know that there is a dispensation
[40:44] we'll read it and he uses it throughout
[40:46] this message the dispensation of the Old
[40:49] Testament and dispensation in the New
[40:51] Testament
[40:52] and you just keep going one of the other
[40:54] to understand
[40:57] and that's what we're trying to
[40:58] understand because we read in a minute
[41:01] that this is the dispensation in the end
[41:03] time
[41:05] of the son of man
[41:07] we will see that it's a dispensation of
[41:09] the Son of God down through seven Church
[41:12] ages
[41:13] because it was a Holy Spirit
[41:15] but to be revealed in the end time as
[41:18] the son of man
[41:19] but it's the same God
[41:24] it's the same God being made manifest
[41:29] all right
[41:30] but see we try to look up words and we
[41:33] get a carnal concept
[41:37] of what words mean and remember we're in
[41:40] our our English language trying to
[41:44] understand
[41:47] the word of God
[41:50] which runs into a lot of problems
[41:52] all right but see look let's look up
[41:55] dispensation now what is a dispensation
[41:57] brother Dale as you've looked up the
[41:59] lights will go to the Greek Lexicon 36
[42:02] 22. that a dispensation is
[42:06] it means like stewardship
[42:08] it means the management now dispensation
[42:11] that's the word
[42:12] the management of a household or of the
[42:15] household of fires specifically the
[42:17] management oversight
[42:20] administration of others property the
[42:23] office of a manager or overseer
[42:25] stewardship Administration dispensation
[42:30] now you take that definition is the
[42:32] definition of stewardship you know is
[42:35] the definition of dispensation of those
[42:38] scriptures that we just use
[42:42] it doesn't look like that it's covering
[42:45] what we need to know
[42:50] but yet you can take this toward shift
[42:52] and you can move it over into it and
[42:54] line up with it you know and the things
[42:56] and and try to bring out the thing but
[42:59] just remember we're trying to look at
[43:00] the word dispensation
[43:05] and we're trying to look at it as a
[43:07] dispensation of the Old Testament a
[43:10] dispensation of the New Testament
[43:14] right
[43:15] a dispensation of the law a dispensation
[43:18] of Grace
[43:20] all right and looking at it then
[43:24] this definition doesn't ring
[43:29] out what we need
[43:32] they said you can take stewardship you
[43:34] can take those things or a household or
[43:36] you know management of a household and
[43:38] say he's the manager all right if you
[43:40] understand
[43:43] but think about it
[43:50] we're not trying to talk about managing
[43:52] a household
[43:55] we're not talking about trying to be a
[43:57] good steward
[43:59] because you were supposed to be that in
[44:01] every dispensation
[44:03] right
[44:05] yeah I mean we're supposed to be that in
[44:07] the Old Testament as well as the new
[44:09] but what are you dealing with
[44:12] all right
[44:14] let's go back to think about what we
[44:16] read in Luke
[44:18] where brother Reynolds says and uses it
[44:20] in the refers and says the dispensation
[44:22] of the Gentiles
[44:24] when it doesn't say that
[44:28] you know literal wording
[44:31] it says the times
[44:34] of the Gentiles
[44:37] the times of the Gentiles all right now
[44:42] Webster says that dispensation is the
[44:46] act of an instance of dispensing
[44:54] Distributing giving out
[45:01] so that doesn't ring up
[45:06] to hold together what we need
[45:09] to understand
[45:11] see
[45:13] now a dispensationalist
[45:16] we had to go through the Googles and the
[45:19] things here to get that because I
[45:21] couldn't find anything I've checked on
[45:22] it and the word dispensationalist is not
[45:26] a word in the dictionary
[45:28] he'd come up into the modern forms like
[45:31] remember we used to say ain't
[45:34] in the
[45:36] finally put that into dictionary as a
[45:39] a form of word but it was there as the
[45:43] little four-legged creature that runs on
[45:45] the ground
[45:46] but we used it so much until they
[45:49] finally put it in the dictionary
[45:51] all right
[45:52] but you see that's more modern
[45:54] terminology
[45:57] in a dispensationalist
[46:00] is like a dispensationalism
[46:03] you can use that word
[46:06] but it means that
[46:08] it's a
[46:10] dispensationalist
[46:13] theology
[46:18] so a dispensationalist is if one who
[46:21] studies
[46:23] dispensations
[46:28] because it's a dispensationalist
[46:29] theology referring to the unified
[46:32] teaching
[46:35] of dispensationalism
[46:37] all right I know that don't mean a thing
[46:39] to most of you it's just all this past
[46:42] 10 minutes 15.
[46:44] you know it's gone
[46:46] but it's very valuable to me
[46:51] because that way I can keep it together
[46:55] and then somebody comes along said oh
[46:57] you didn't know it brother randomly used
[46:59] that over here that he didn't even
[47:00] believe in that
[47:03] well the quotes I gave you where he said
[47:05] he didn't go along with that much he
[47:07] goes right on to say that there's a
[47:09] dispensation of the Gentiles
[47:12] so what are you saying brother Dale
[47:17] why not convert that word dispensation
[47:20] into Times
[47:24] and remember
[47:26] that it's the same God
[47:29] in the Old Testament
[47:31] is being revealed in the New Testament
[47:35] he didn't change God's
[47:39] you changed the times
[47:43] then you're not going into a
[47:45] dispensationalism
[47:47] Or List as to be just studying
[47:50] dispensations
[47:53] you can see what brought a random is
[47:55] saying that he believed in
[47:57] dispensationalist
[47:59] in the basis that it's revealing the
[48:02] same one true and living God
[48:04] that there was salvation in the Old
[48:06] Testament the Salvation in the New
[48:08] Testament
[48:09] all right now that's dispensations but
[48:13] the same salvation
[48:15] now dispensationalism or
[48:18] dispensationalist theology what if
[48:21] you're a trinitarian
[48:26] then you had a god of the Old Testament
[48:31] remember father you know
[48:33] he knew you've got a god of the New
[48:34] Testament son
[48:37] so you'd be totally out of the
[48:39] scriptures
[48:40] so you can't follow the scriptures you
[48:43] can't line up with that form because
[48:45] you're into trinidarianism
[48:49] I mean this ought to help you a little
[48:50] bit on one God
[48:53] it's the same God being revealed in the
[48:55] Old Testament is in the New Testament
[48:57] all right it's the same God being
[49:00] revealed in Bride form
[49:05] in a many-membered body
[49:08] right
[49:10] it's not another God see if you were
[49:12] going into dispensationalisms
[49:15] you can go into any kind of a theory
[49:18] or a theology
[49:20] that would divide up those things and
[49:23] they'll cover seven dispensations I've
[49:25] got them in office you've got seven
[49:27] dispensations according to
[49:29] dispensationalisms you got this you got
[49:31] that you got all kinds of things
[49:35] but yet it won't tie together
[49:37] because if you're taking trinitarianism
[49:38] to try to understand one God
[49:41] where are you going to be
[49:44] but if you take it as a dispensation
[49:47] that God is revealing himself this way
[49:51] here
[49:53] and this way here
[49:55] now you can understand the church ages
[49:58] you can see that it started out as a
[50:00] great beautiful church with the true
[50:03] teaching of one true and living God
[50:07] what you can see is the word went down
[50:09] and it started to be restored
[50:11] that you're coming back into a
[50:14] time
[50:16] that they didn't have all the word
[50:17] revealed right
[50:21] Luther come forth the best he could be
[50:23] which was great it's in the Bible spoke
[50:27] of
[50:27] I will restore
[50:30] the years of the Canton Warren by more
[50:31] Locust caterpillar but Luther couldn't
[50:34] bring it all forth
[50:39] these two is the same illustration is if
[50:42] you're taking trinitarianism you're
[50:44] going to have a God here and a God here
[50:47] and it'll make it two different gods
[50:51] but if you take the same God
[50:53] that was in the early church
[50:56] and let that word that seed go into the
[51:00] ground
[51:01] and then that seed come back into two
[51:03] little shoots of Luther
[51:06] and you'll see that that grain is
[51:08] heading back toward where it's supposed
[51:11] to be
[51:13] and then you can cover and they'll cover
[51:15] your dispensation
[51:20] then you come over to Methodist see more
[51:23] is brought out why because it's coming
[51:26] back more towards original
[51:28] all right so then it's coming back to
[51:30] the truth
[51:32] of understanding
[51:35] then you come into the Pentecostals with
[51:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:41] brother around said no message to the
[51:43] age because the Holy Ghost came himself
[51:44] in a great prophet
[51:47] that's not brother random because he
[51:48] says it that's 464 the old silver he
[51:51] said then that's the other the messenger
[51:54] comes at the end of the age
[51:58] see this since the day of Pentecost of
[52:01] Zeus history this has been a prophetic
[52:03] age
[52:04] no that's only with brother Brown
[52:07] me
[52:09] no the Holy Ghost is the prophet
[52:13] right
[52:15] I remember we were up at Jeffersonville
[52:17] when
[52:19] Billy Paul come out there in the old
[52:20] thing with who was to take over and who
[52:22] was the guide after who was to be this
[52:24] holy ghost that was to leave
[52:26] he said I just heard the prophet say
[52:30] the Elijah of this day is the Holy Ghost
[52:36] well that was good you know
[52:40] you're not changing dispensations
[52:44] as to make this this dispensation be
[52:47] great and this dispensation not be very
[52:50] great that's my point of trying to get
[52:52] you to see that it takes the whole
[52:55] entire bride to seven Church ages to be
[52:58] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[53:02] it will take the whole bride through
[53:04] seven Church ages to be the son of man
[53:09] but we're just in the end time
[53:13] dispensation
[53:16] we're in the end times
[53:18] words to come forth in full
[53:20] manifestation
[53:24] that don't make us no different
[53:29] in Luther's justification
[53:33] that's where I've been fought all the
[53:34] years trying to bring that
[53:37] oh he was how fun he was Omega how many
[53:40] of you heard messages on
[53:43] and he's nothing in between
[53:45] that's a direct quote
[53:47] then he's an alpha and omega and all in
[53:51] between that's a direct quote now well
[53:53] you got two quotes fighting each other
[53:55] well I want this one I believe this one
[53:58] you you can take that one
[54:01] you ever heard people in the message say
[54:03] we as the bride take Acts 2 38 as for
[54:07] our baptism
[54:09] you know
[54:10] Lord Jesus Christ consider denominations
[54:12] take father son Holy Ghost
[54:14] if they took Father Son and Holy Ghost
[54:17] they would get baptized in the name of
[54:18] the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:20] they took a perversion of it
[54:23] and took the literal compound meaning of
[54:25] the word
[54:27] and died with it
[54:29] so can we
[54:34] that's why I fight so hard
[54:36] I know I make it hard why because we
[54:40] don't play in church
[54:44] I was thinking the other day
[54:48] and and I won't do it now but I was
[54:50] thinking especially out on the internet
[54:51] too but
[54:53] but them on the internet I can't see you
[54:55] so you can raise your hands if you want
[54:57] to
[55:00] but
[55:01] if I asked how many here have the
[55:03] baptism when the Holy Ghost a lot of
[55:05] hands go up
[55:08] and I'd say how many of you believe that
[55:11] by having that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:13] that makes you the bride of Christ
[55:16] everybody's hand it went up the first
[55:18] time or to go up the second time
[55:20] all right right
[55:24] well watch it watch your hand go for
[55:26] that how many of you believe that the
[55:29] Bride of Jesus Christ is the fullness of
[55:31] the godhead bodily
[55:34] that's what the Bible says and what's
[55:36] your prophecy but the hands don't go up
[55:40] you believe it all right up to a while
[55:42] and you'll say well now brother Dale in
[55:44] a way or our brother Brandon was really
[55:47] just saying something to you know make
[55:49] us feel good
[55:54] he made me feel good
[55:57] because I read the quotes in the church
[56:00] in Athens Georgia in 1969 and back then
[56:03] we just had very little concordances of
[56:06] most of it was handmade off the tape
[56:08] recorders ourselves
[56:10] as quotes from The Prophet
[56:13] and I thought enough of it I wrote it in
[56:15] the front of my Bible and everybody's
[56:16] ever here you know I can hold it up and
[56:18] show you the quotes that I used then and
[56:21] I just kept adding to it
[56:23] that's where the computer come in
[56:26] to help us
[56:27] I used to buy every concordance could be
[56:29] bought even though the first 15 pages
[56:32] was to prove a false Doctrine
[56:38] still bottom you know why
[56:41] because what they were saying was right
[56:42] they were just interpreted it wrong and
[56:45] the rest of the message I was getting
[56:46] the quotes
[56:47] I didn't give a hoot about your Doctrine
[56:51] because that goes into what it's talking
[56:52] about dispensationalist
[56:54] but theology
[56:58] that you can argue over dispensations
[57:06] um
[57:07] but the Bible is divided up into things
[57:11] to be revealed maybe it's the way of
[57:13] saying it
[57:15] and that word things is not thrown off
[57:17] on God
[57:19] but it means that that Luther couldn't
[57:22] make manifest what we can make manifest
[57:26] but when are we going to believe it
[57:29] like I said I believe I'm bride
[57:33] I've heard people say I believe I have
[57:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[57:38] know where I'm
[57:39] where I'm gonna be in Rapture or not
[57:46] now that's a great understanding
[57:52] and I say how many believes you're born
[57:54] again oh I believe how many believe you
[57:56] in the bright well I don't know yet
[57:57] whether I'm in the bride
[57:59] that's utter stupidity
[58:04] if you have the Holy Ghost that is the
[58:06] bride
[58:07] right
[58:10] and why can't we believe that if Luther
[58:12] made it manifest in his day Wesley made
[58:15] it manifest Pentecost made it manifest
[58:17] brother Branham made it manifest
[58:22] what are we doing sitting around waiting
[58:24] on the bus
[58:26] you know
[58:28] well when when uh when when the woman
[58:31] gets in the White House
[58:34] it's got to be a you know it's got to be
[58:36] elected president
[58:38] now the United States you know and she's
[58:40] got to be a pope too because she got
[58:42] quotes right one a woman in the White
[58:44] House there wasn't a pope and so you
[58:46] know about the United States so once you
[58:48] put it all together and just make some
[58:49] of these women let them run for
[58:50] president let them be the pro Pope too
[58:56] that's what it is it's this Plum
[58:58] silliness
[59:02] because we're looking for something to
[59:04] happen
[59:06] when brother Brown said like the the
[59:07] moon turned into blood he said I can
[59:09] show you where that happened
[59:11] we're still looking for the moon to turn
[59:12] the blood
[59:13] oh if I ever see it with a with a red
[59:15] Cloud going across the Moon it turned to
[59:17] blood there it is we're ready to go now
[59:21] I thought it was Rapture in faith
[59:24] Rapture in Revelation that was going to
[59:26] take us out of here
[59:27] I didn't know it was just because of
[59:29] dating the times and the seasons Paul
[59:31] said I'm scared of your experience
[59:36] we get people to really hear dates and
[59:38] times and to hear the truth
[59:40] right
[59:42] well see when I look at dispensation
[59:44] then there's a Time
[59:46] for the Bible says at the time what
[59:50] to all
[59:53] it doesn't say there is a time for all
[59:56] things
[59:57] that's in Ecclesiastes it does not say
[1:00:00] that it says there's a Time
[1:00:03] to
[1:00:04] not a Time far
[1:00:06] because that would mean you got to wait
[1:00:08] to that there's a time too
[1:00:10] when God brings it to Pius it'll be
[1:00:12] right
[1:00:14] did you understand what I'm trying to
[1:00:16] get at
[1:00:17] yes we can look at a dispensation of the
[1:00:19] Old Testament we can look at a
[1:00:21] dispensation of the New Testament we
[1:00:23] look at the dispensation of one being
[1:00:25] the law we look at the other half be in
[1:00:27] Grace
[1:00:29] but do we see the same God
[1:00:34] or do we change gods in the middle and
[1:00:36] get a second person or something
[1:00:41] right
[1:00:44] you know a prophet coming over after
[1:00:46] years and years of preaching one true
[1:00:48] and living God he's rejoicing overseeing
[1:00:51] three now if I'm putting this not
[1:00:53] getting it right together the whole
[1:00:54] point you get it together he saw the
[1:00:56] rainbows and things and it The Voice or
[1:00:58] something said Jehovah the old is Jesus
[1:01:01] of the new
[1:01:05] good night
[1:01:08] yet he'd always preached that
[1:01:13] right
[1:01:16] he said in him never preaching a trinity
[1:01:19] but he said I used to think
[1:01:21] that God hated me and Jesus loved me
[1:01:26] he said until I found out it's the same
[1:01:28] person
[1:01:34] come on Church
[1:01:36] it's about time for us to to get into it
[1:01:39] what is what are we here for
[1:01:43] that's all I've been screaming about for
[1:01:45] 40 something years
[1:01:49] not had to change to get a new doctor
[1:01:51] and get a new date and a new time and a
[1:01:54] following or another to follow her or
[1:01:56] something
[1:01:58] as a matter of fact God has always
[1:01:59] seemed to have left me alone
[1:02:02] I just don't fit nobody's camp
[1:02:06] I never have they tried to get me into
[1:02:08] this and try to get into the ice don't
[1:02:09] fit
[1:02:11] well I guess I'm just too independent
[1:02:14] too stubborn
[1:02:15] and the older I get I get more
[1:02:17] independent more stubborn
[1:02:20] and you do too
[1:02:24] okay
[1:02:25] you're young you do it too
[1:02:29] listen Church
[1:02:31] do you see what I'm talking about
[1:02:33] to understand why Prophet would say I
[1:02:36] believe in dispensationalists
[1:02:39] but I don't believe in dispensations
[1:02:43] he's putting together something
[1:02:45] in a way
[1:02:47] because when his thoughts this year of
[1:02:49] believing in dispensationalist he said
[1:02:51] God is a dispensationalist and the
[1:02:54] Gentile dispensation and the then when
[1:02:56] he moves over he's still using the same
[1:02:58] scripture but he's seeing it
[1:03:05] that if he's seeing a God over here
[1:03:06] different from the god over here
[1:03:10] you know one over here at the Old Town
[1:03:13] one over here is the New Testament oh
[1:03:15] that old time he was angry hateful
[1:03:17] well even mean hateful
[1:03:21] was he
[1:03:29] who made the first killing in the Bible
[1:03:34] God
[1:03:35] to cover his children
[1:03:38] the first murderer of physical things
[1:03:40] was God himself
[1:03:42] to cover us
[1:03:45] who is that hateful arrogant old mean
[1:03:47] God of the Old Testament when he says
[1:03:49] Abraham
[1:03:53] I give you an unconditional Covenant
[1:04:00] come on
[1:04:02] that don't sound like a arrogant hateful
[1:04:04] old Dodie God
[1:04:09] he's not fixing to kill the people and
[1:04:10] Moses said Aaron grab your sensor run
[1:04:13] among the people
[1:04:15] free adventure you may make an atonement
[1:04:19] you know what God backs off on what he's
[1:04:21] doing
[1:04:24] right
[1:04:26] I mean arrogant hateful God
[1:04:30] that Moses said one day he says now
[1:04:33] listen
[1:04:35] if you kill them people you got to come
[1:04:37] over me
[1:04:41] all right okay Moses
[1:04:45] okay Moses
[1:04:47] I will come over here
[1:04:49] we said one of these days I'll visit
[1:04:51] them
[1:04:57] but we look at it as
[1:05:02] what kind of a God have you got
[1:05:06] if Jehovah the old is Jesus unto you if
[1:05:09] it's right in the Bible do you believe
[1:05:11] the Bible don't raise your hand just if
[1:05:12] you believe it
[1:05:13] well then Hebrews 13 8 says he's the
[1:05:15] same what
[1:05:17] oh he's the same today and tomorrow
[1:05:20] because that's Utah
[1:05:21] no that's not exactly the way it says it
[1:05:27] says Jesus Christ is saying yes today
[1:05:31] Old Testament today
[1:05:34] not their worries standing in Forever
[1:05:38] the same God
[1:05:41] do you understand it
[1:05:45] then the church ages
[1:05:47] is covering the same God
[1:05:52] but it's just the way he's making
[1:05:53] himself known
[1:05:56] that was what he'd done in the Old
[1:05:57] Testament
[1:06:00] I write these messages down I think man
[1:06:03] I'm going to get through this message in
[1:06:04] a hurry I ain't going to get through
[1:06:06] this and it'll be this evening I'll
[1:06:07] finish it
[1:06:08] but do you understand
[1:06:12] the times the Bible says of the Gentiles
[1:06:16] be fulfilled
[1:06:19] the prophet interpreting that says the
[1:06:21] dispensation of the Gentiles
[1:06:25] so then what we need to use as
[1:06:27] dispensation is the word times
[1:06:31] that's not changing nothing
[1:06:34] we can read what Paul would say in the
[1:06:37] times
[1:06:40] that God chose to give this
[1:06:43] these Church aides was
[1:06:46] God was revealing himself in those ages
[1:06:54] as I said while ago he's in the midst of
[1:06:56] the seven golden candlestick
[1:07:00] means he's in every Church age the same
[1:07:04] but you just can't make himself manifest
[1:07:06] because they don't have the word
[1:07:10] he was in the Old Testament right
[1:07:14] come on brother Brown said that was
[1:07:16] Christ in Moses
[1:07:17] that could tell God a better way of
[1:07:19] doing something
[1:07:21] it was Christ coming down through there
[1:07:23] but he couldn't make himself manifest as
[1:07:25] a savior could he
[1:07:27] because it was a different dispensation
[1:07:29] he was born a baby laying in a Manger he
[1:07:33] wasn't a savior he was a savior to be
[1:07:35] later on
[1:07:37] right
[1:07:39] he was coming to be king
[1:07:42] right
[1:07:43] he was a prince
[1:07:45] Prince is one in the leading line to go
[1:07:48] to be king you know what's going to
[1:07:49] happen to King got to get out of the way
[1:07:50] it's
[1:07:53] right
[1:07:55] do you see what I'm talking about then
[1:07:57] throughout the whole Bible at the whole
[1:07:59] Bible is revealing the one true and
[1:08:02] living God
[1:08:08] see it doesn't wind up into Revelations
[1:08:09] with a different God
[1:08:15] it's just the basis of how he's dealing
[1:08:21] he's a wonderful God
[1:08:25] person today gets saved somewhere right
[1:08:27] here or anywhere but say they've never
[1:08:28] heard nothing you know
[1:08:30] and then they come in and they they get
[1:08:32] saved you know God don't require them to
[1:08:35] understand everything right
[1:08:40] but I get into the silliness of it you
[1:08:42] know like I say I'd preach to some of
[1:08:45] you for 10 years to try to get some
[1:08:47] Doctrine out of you that I can see there
[1:08:49] that you can't see you got
[1:08:51] or won't admit you got
[1:08:53] but then you start to tell if somebody
[1:08:54] else to say I saw that immediately the
[1:08:56] quickest the prophet said man I saw that
[1:08:58] I saw that immediately
[1:09:01] I said well why did it take me five
[1:09:03] years to get you baptized in the name of
[1:09:05] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:10] come on
[1:09:11] I'm sorry I'm just too old to be playing
[1:09:15] but I didn't play when I was there in my
[1:09:17] 30s
[1:09:20] you go back and listen to the tapes back
[1:09:21] there there here and you hear me
[1:09:24] screaming and hollering these same
[1:09:25] things
[1:09:26] why because church I've always looked at
[1:09:30] it and believed it if I could if that
[1:09:32] was the first message I preached that
[1:09:34] the bride would be the son of man you
[1:09:36] think I've changed since then
[1:09:41] but it was a wonderful thing to start
[1:09:43] out
[1:09:45] amen
[1:09:50] I mean I didn't come up with any little
[1:09:51] sugar tits you know well God is good and
[1:09:55] we're all good and we don't need to
[1:09:57] throw off on anybody because we're all
[1:09:59] the same
[1:10:02] we're not going to be a Christian Life
[1:10:04] that would not be nothing you don't have
[1:10:05] to be born again to be a good
[1:10:07] right you know we're not you don't have
[1:10:09] to be born again to not look down on
[1:10:11] nobody else in order to teach your kids
[1:10:12] that
[1:10:16] you're going to be taught from birth
[1:10:17] that you're no different
[1:10:20] that's wrong we don't have no problem
[1:10:21] with racisms or nothing why
[1:10:25] because we never were racist
[1:10:27] I don't even know the difference in them
[1:10:29] words I can't keep up with it
[1:10:33] I've never looked down on anybody as a
[1:10:35] coloration of a skin
[1:10:38] we're all human beings
[1:10:45] let's see Church look
[1:10:50] when God is revealing himself
[1:10:56] he's revealing it for the hour the time
[1:11:00] ah
[1:11:02] right
[1:11:05] right we'll get to it more this
[1:11:06] afternoon where see Jesus kept saying
[1:11:09] son of man son of man son of man
[1:11:16] why
[1:11:18] because that's what he was making
[1:11:19] manifest
[1:11:22] he wasn't making manifest Son of God
[1:11:23] that would come as a baptism of the Holy
[1:11:26] Ghost on the day of Pentecost
[1:11:31] but it would be a revealing or a time to
[1:11:34] all things a time for this to take place
[1:11:38] this is the end time for us to realize
[1:11:40] Who We Are
[1:11:44] but there we go I believe I'm born again
[1:11:47] I believe I'm bride I don't know about
[1:11:49] this
[1:11:50] being the son of man
[1:11:52] brother Brown's just on a man run around
[1:11:54] and make these son of man
[1:11:57] he says he wouldn't now you argue with
[1:11:59] him about it
[1:12:00] he said he was a son of man
[1:12:09] the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man
[1:12:11] so if you say he was decent of man
[1:12:13] you're making him the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:14] and that's what a lot of the people of
[1:12:16] the message has done well yes you tell
[1:12:18] them that they're a deity as to that and
[1:12:21] they'd fight you
[1:12:24] but your Doctrine proves what you're
[1:12:26] thinking
[1:12:27] you know the best way to find out what a
[1:12:29] preacher is preaching
[1:12:31] I found this out a long time ago
[1:12:33] you sit down talk to him all you want to
[1:12:35] and you'll never know what he's
[1:12:36] preaching just go to his congregation
[1:12:37] and ask them
[1:12:41] right and especially get up and preach
[1:12:43] something contrary to what he's
[1:12:45] talking you're going to find out in a
[1:12:47] hurry what
[1:12:48] what he believes
[1:12:51] right
[1:12:54] that's the people what the pastor
[1:12:56] believes
[1:12:59] and I'd hope you'd give the right answer
[1:13:03] there's one thing about brother Dale he
[1:13:05] believes one true and living God
[1:13:08] because every Sherman that's what he
[1:13:09] preaches one true and living God well 40
[1:13:12] something years I'm still preaching on
[1:13:13] it we stay around here another 40. oh
[1:13:16] that'd make me older
[1:13:19] but my Lord Church
[1:13:23] why don't we to make manifest
[1:13:30] well brother Branham done it all we're
[1:13:33] just sitting down waiting on the end of
[1:13:34] time
[1:13:36] now I want to see that in the Bible I
[1:13:37] want to see it in the quotes of the
[1:13:38] Prophet I don't understand anything I
[1:13:40] want to see it in plain common sense
[1:13:47] well I believe right around was a
[1:13:49] prophet but I don't know about you
[1:13:52] if I read what he says
[1:13:55] you're not arguing with me
[1:14:01] you're not arguing with me if I read
[1:14:03] those quotes about the bride would be
[1:14:05] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:14:09] you're going to talk to him about that
[1:14:11] not me
[1:14:12] I read what he said
[1:14:15] well you slanted it I see you're slammed
[1:14:19] you got to Pulpit this evening men women
[1:14:22] children whoever wants it
[1:14:24] and I don't mean that sarcastically I
[1:14:26] mean it is a God's honest truth
[1:14:30] I'll let your sister get right up here
[1:14:31] this evening in this pulpit and
[1:14:33] straighten me out on what I've tried to
[1:14:35] preach to you for 40 something years
[1:14:38] and it'll go on internet where they can
[1:14:40] see it
[1:14:45] see that's just why I believe it and
[1:14:46] when I believe something I'm going to
[1:14:48] stand for it
[1:14:50] what is that old saying if you won't
[1:14:51] stand for something you'll fall for
[1:14:52] nothing
[1:14:53] or something like that anything yeah
[1:14:58] at least tell somebody what you believe
[1:15:06] I'd rather tell you what I believe then
[1:15:08] if I'm wrong I get the benefits
[1:15:13] what if I'm right ain't gonna worry
[1:15:14] about it
[1:15:19] but you see that's what the people don't
[1:15:20] want to talk to you like that
[1:15:24] but I'm just saying I like to see when
[1:15:27] brother Randall will come along and say
[1:15:28] I'm a dispensationalist and God is then
[1:15:31] he says I'm not much on being a
[1:15:32] dispensations
[1:15:34] I know there's something got there got
[1:15:35] to be put together
[1:15:36] and when it does I can be happy
[1:15:40] because I'm not just quoting quotes
[1:15:45] I can see it by revelation
[1:15:48] was totally against the dispensation of
[1:15:51] the Old Testament to be anything
[1:15:52] different than the new other than
[1:15:55] that was the law that was the time that
[1:15:58] was salvation under that law but it
[1:16:00] could not bring the New Birth
[1:16:06] and then it would come into the New
[1:16:08] Testament as to bring in that same
[1:16:10] Jehovah
[1:16:13] and then the prophet would say it you
[1:16:15] know Jehovah crying in a cradle
[1:16:20] prop he took a prophet say that no
[1:16:22] Theologian would ever even have enough
[1:16:23] sense to
[1:16:25] have you ever heard him say like this he
[1:16:27] said a god with no teeth
[1:16:31] I remember when I first heard
[1:16:41] god with no teeth
[1:16:47] but see he couldn't have a baby die for
[1:16:49] our sins
[1:16:51] even at 12 years old or 13 whatever that
[1:16:53] he would argue with the priest he could
[1:16:56] argue with them in the word but yet he
[1:16:58] couldn't die for the sins of the people
[1:17:02] when he started his ministry on the
[1:17:03] River Jordan he could not die at that
[1:17:06] time
[1:17:08] it would have to be three and a half
[1:17:10] years or something there later
[1:17:13] that he would be able to come and die
[1:17:14] for the sins of the people
[1:17:16] why because it would be the times of it
[1:17:22] time for this and the time for that
[1:17:27] but I hope you understand maybe they'll
[1:17:28] get it out of the way at least to what I
[1:17:30] believe the reason I say it don't look
[1:17:33] as to think that we in the end time are
[1:17:36] something special
[1:17:38] we're different from all the rest of
[1:17:40] them that was Alpha back to our national
[1:17:42] Omega down here and boy we're great look
[1:17:44] at us
[1:17:46] you heading to the garbage can when you
[1:17:48] think like that
[1:17:50] don't think too much about it because
[1:17:51] you're already in the garbage can when
[1:17:53] you think like that
[1:17:56] but when you see that he's Jesus Christ
[1:17:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:18:02] what he was he still is and forever will
[1:18:05] be
[1:18:07] right
[1:18:09] a dispensation
[1:18:16] a way of showing himself
[1:18:18] for the time
[1:18:20] but not showing something else
[1:18:22] it's one of the Bride I keep emphasizing
[1:18:24] that the bride is not some other source
[1:18:27] he is the same Source made manifest
[1:18:30] by the new birth
[1:18:34] and the difference between him
[1:18:36] and the bride
[1:18:39] is the physical Corporal body that he
[1:18:41] lived in
[1:18:45] because we live in these sinful garbage
[1:18:47] cans
[1:18:53] but we're coming to a place to have a
[1:18:55] body like unto his glorious body
[1:18:58] if we have a body lock into his glorious
[1:19:00] body you know what that means evidently
[1:19:01] going to be like him
[1:19:06] right right
[1:19:10] Wednesday night and he didn't know where
[1:19:12] I was headed
[1:19:13] you know turn on over here a little bit
[1:19:15] and I get over to
[1:19:16] Genesis 1 26 27.
[1:19:21] we don't talk about what we're going to
[1:19:23] preach deliberately
[1:19:26] you know why because I don't want him to
[1:19:28] be influenced I don't want these
[1:19:29] brothers to be influenced
[1:19:31] I wondered pretty much on their heart
[1:19:34] because that's the only way I'll know
[1:19:36] whether they preaching the truth or not
[1:19:37] because if not they're just saying what
[1:19:38] I say
[1:19:40] what good is that
[1:19:43] make your twofold child of hell and
[1:19:45] start with
[1:19:47] come on musicians
[1:19:48] think on these things
[1:19:55] we are in a day and a time that there is
[1:19:58] a word to be revealed in this day
[1:20:01] we're in a dispensation if you want to
[1:20:04] call it
[1:20:07] but we're not changing God's to change
[1:20:10] dispensation
[1:20:12] it's the same God made manifest in a
[1:20:15] many-membered body
[1:20:19] there's no way that we could have
[1:20:21] anything to do with even thinking about
[1:20:22] being the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:20:24] if he had not ordained it to beat that
[1:20:27] away
[1:20:30] because we can't be anything
[1:20:33] as long as we keep remembered we're
[1:20:34] nothing
[1:20:36] we're all right
[1:20:38] well brother Dale I'm trying to be
[1:20:39] something well go ahead
[1:20:42] I'm trying my best to be nothing
[1:20:45] then he can use me
[1:20:47] but if you're trying to be something
[1:20:49] you're getting the wrong idea
[1:20:51] you know that a sister used to play the
[1:20:54] piano
[1:20:54] for us told me
[1:20:57] she said the way it's preached here and
[1:21:00] you realize we were preaching back then
[1:21:02] so the way it's being preached here in
[1:21:04] the church about the one true and living
[1:21:06] God and us being God made manifest in
[1:21:09] flesh
[1:21:11] she said well then it don't matter what
[1:21:13] I do
[1:21:18] I said sister you've got the wrong idea
[1:21:23] the more that I see of what he is the
[1:21:26] more conscious I've become of how this
[1:21:28] garbage can is in the way
[1:21:31] I told her I said you've misunderstood
[1:21:33] she said yeah but it's preaching I'm
[1:21:35] gone
[1:21:42] I said but it's not that kind
[1:21:46] nope I knew that let's stand go ahead

[1:32:11] my concern is for you and I to do one
[1:32:13] thing and that's become what God says we
[1:32:15] are
[1:32:16] the only way you can do that is by
[1:32:18] reading or and studying it
[1:32:21] it's not going to come by some special
[1:32:23] thing falling out of the sky
[1:32:27] God has already give us the word what
[1:32:30] else do we need
[1:32:33] what would it be to try to something to
[1:32:35] stir your thinking
[1:32:39] well not just read
[1:32:43] if that don't stare you there's
[1:32:44] something wrong with you
[1:32:47] I mean I love we've listened to a tape
[1:32:50] last night
[1:32:51] in this California thing
[1:32:54] and brother random he spent longer in a
[1:32:58] prayer
[1:33:00] trying to get people to alter
[1:33:02] and probably the time that he preached
[1:33:05] because he was concerned
[1:33:07] and you know what his thought was
[1:33:10] I want a Revival
[1:33:14] as Angeline Temple
[1:33:16] he said I want a Revival
[1:33:19] he said I've even canceled my fishing
[1:33:21] trip that I'm supposed to leave
[1:33:24] and go he was going to somewhere where
[1:33:26] he always wanted to go fish down in
[1:33:28] Mexico or somewhere New Mexico or Mexico
[1:33:30] one he said I've canceled that
[1:33:34] he said I'm going to stay here
[1:33:37] he said I want a Revival
[1:33:41] he needed for praying and the people
[1:33:44] coming to the halter
[1:33:46] you see the man's sincerity
[1:33:49] it wasn't a great seals the plagues the
[1:33:51] vowels the trumpets to things
[1:33:54] it was the Simplicity of trying to get
[1:33:56] them to see Jesus cry
[1:34:00] he was trying to beat him to come to a
[1:34:02] Revival
[1:34:05] never hurt him that long I've heard the
[1:34:07] tape before I know a lot of times I'm
[1:34:10] just like you when I get ready to go to
[1:34:12] bed or something at night I listen to
[1:34:13] the tape and dude when he comes down to
[1:34:15] the prayer line or something we turn it
[1:34:16] off and go to bed because we're out
[1:34:18] something but
[1:34:21] 45 minutes or something he was still
[1:34:23] giving an altar caller talking to the
[1:34:25] people
[1:34:28] the prophet of God was doing
[1:34:32] that in order to be the desire in each
[1:34:33] one of our hearts and lives for a
[1:34:35] Revival
[1:34:36] let it begin in me
[1:34:41] because that's what I've prayed for 40
[1:34:42] something years
[1:34:44] is for people to see who they are when
[1:34:48] you see who you are you're going to be
[1:34:50] in a Revival and you may be the only
[1:34:52] person that's in it
[1:34:56] right
[1:34:59] because it's to you personally
[1:35:02] father we just thank you Lord we love
[1:35:04] you
[1:35:04] we just ask you to go with us now as we
[1:35:06] go into the natural meal bring us back
[1:35:09] together this afternoon in your love we
[1:35:11] love you father and we thank you have
[1:35:13] your way in Jesus name
[1:35:16] you dismissed
