========================================

God bless you all it's good to be back and we sure appreciate uh brother Ryan and brother John for filling in the last couple of weeks and um I apologize I'm still not caught up but uh we sure appreciate and I will get caught up um with all of the lessons and preaching I think brother brother Aaron was working hard too two two Wednesday nights and then preaching for brother pageant bless him sure appreciate all the labors where we left off was Hebrews 11 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to look into your word this morning Lord as we study these things out and in this uh chapter of the Hall of faith that that Paul laid out for us as an example of what the things that we can have access to if we believe Lord I pray Lord that you'll just help us to understand Lord and to get our our hearts and Minds prepared for the the word to go forth and that you'll just be with brother Daryl Lord as he's studying Lord Jesus and preparing granted Lord that you'll just bless the services for us today we ask in your name amen so Hebrews 11:1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and that's a a weighty thing to meditate on um you know when we were down there in Nicaragua there was a lot of things that we could uh that that uh that blessed us and a lot of things that that kind of um to think about but one thing I uh that really meant a lot to me was on the plane ride back I got to talking to this gentleman next to me and U he turned out to be a missionary that was going down there and and speaking to some people down there and and uh and uh one thing led to another and we we we spent about 2 and 1/2 hours just talking about the Lord and talking about uh preaching and different things and and uh I got I got to talking to him about how that God is still a miracle working God and we started talking about that and and I I've never seen somebody choked up so much on not choked up like crying but choked up like trying to trying to swallow that God can is still a miracle working God now you think about what Paul led up to when he gets to Hebrews 11 he's he's laid the foundation of all these things that we to to to to to prove to us why we should trust TR the word of Jesus Christ and that we've not heard just the word of an angel or the word of a minister but we've heard we've heard straight from God himself that's come down and and this is this man that came down is the the actual the um the essence of God like like brother darl was saying yesterday the the heart of God and and and see all these things like like if you remember the last Sunday school I listen that I preached you when somebody tells you something uh there uh you want to the the I I guess the highest compliment you can give is just to believe what they say and so God wants us to believe what he said and uh I was thinking about just all the all the messages that we heard in Nicaragua preached all you Zach Wallace was down there preaching and brother Louise preached at the camp and just everything was based on just believe what God Said even brother Louise gave the example he got up and with the young people and said it's just like you you he had the little dollar bill and he said if you if you just come up and take this dollar bill out of my hand because you believe I'm going to give it to you and somebody came up and took it but you know all these examples of just just believe just just have faith so when it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for our faith is based upon God's word if you it seems like the hardest thing for us to do is just to accept what God has said about something if God said and and you see when you read something in the Bible or you hear Brother BR say it on the tape or or you hear a preacher preach about it it it it is for you and that's the hardest thing for us to accept that that promise that when God made a promise is for you that it's not just something to learn about or or to study on and memorize but it's for you so all of these promises that are laying here in the Bible that about healing about salvation about Deliverance everything that that's laying there if you believe it like Abraham did and hang on to it then God is going to fulfill it and and and I I believe fulfill it in a way that that uh like really the last sermon I was preaching if what I preached to here too that if you believe something's going to happen I think that's what that gentleman on the plane was struggling with that that you know we we we come sometimes we have a a we an idea that when we come to church we're just kind of coming to learn and we say well we believe and and then not expecting something to happen not expecting our life to be changed amen not expecting our body to be healed but if you believe it's the substance of what you are hoping for it is the thing that you're looking for and it's based upon the promise of God that he made to you yes and if you believe if you really believe something is going to happen so it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not think seen now you you think about what Paul's saying here in the Hebrews 11 he's laying down all these examples of people that believed and then something happened like he said in at the end of the chapter he said through faith these people subdued kingdoms now not just little bitty things happen but they they subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness they obtain promises sto the mouths of lions in other words they did The Impossible what what seemed like just imp how are you going to stop the mouth of a lion you get thrown down into a lion pit and all the lions are sniffing around and you they haven't eaten in in weeks that is impossible but that same God that stopped the mouth of lions is still the same God today you see why brother Ram said that God's going to have a bride that does not doubt that he's the same yesterday today and forever and uh that that's why that conversation with that gentleman on the plane was so impactful to me because that's that really is a differentiator between what we believe in the message and what the denominational world looks at it that really are struggling that he's the same yesterday today and forever that he's still a miracle working God and I wonder I wonder maybe if if we struggle with that that that we're not just coming to church to just warm the bench or keep the lights turned on but we're here to serve a god that is still active and that can still do something in our lives amen maybe let's let's set our mind that way as before the preaching of the word this morning before brother Daryl comes out that that something something can happen if you really believe that is for you that God made the promises for you they quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed violent and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women receive their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a b better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment so see when you believe something's going to happen brother Bram said in questions and answers he said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you do not see taste feel smell or hear but by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him till he's just as good as got it in his hand he knows it's going to happen now you see you read things we read things like that and we think well if I can just work up Faith or whatever but but the Bible says faith comes by the word so it's not something you work up but it's something that automatically happens as you eat the word in other words you keep hearing these promises preached and you keep reading and it just builds up until something begins to automatically happen into you that I know that if God promised it that he's able to make it come to pass and then it it begins to build up into a substance where you got it even though even though you don't see it even though the skies are cloudy it it doesn't matter because you got it and it's the substance that's that's why there there's a lot of a lot of things that we can use as an evidence that manifestation jumping around lights and visions and dreams and that kind of stuff but the Bible says that those things are not the evidence faith is the evidence that's why faith is even the evidence of your new birth not that you jumped or ran down the aisle or something but you have something that trumps all of those things you have a more sure word of Prophecy than being with Jesus or being with brother brandham that you know down in your heart that God has made something real to you and that is that is something that that nobody can take away from you it's something that's it's it's that is the evidence that's the evidence of the thing that you can't even see yet but you know that you already have it so brother R said in the message persevered and he said how could a man ever have faith by putting his hand on a tree would make him well you got to have faith in something see he was having a conversation with somebody and they said well I could I believe if I just put my hand on a tree or maybe you know put your hand on the pulpit you believe that you you if you have faith in that you know but he said you got to have faith in something you just you're not we're not having faith in just the heir or some something that somebody told us like like just some man some man's idea but we're believing like Paul has laid out for us all the way up to Hebrews 11 and what God Said Yes amen you you see how it it seems so simple sometimes when we preach it but it's that's what we're really battling out the greatest battle ever fought is is this promise for me is all these things that we read about is it for me or not and we just sit here and we we maybe we get tired but but yet all of these promises if we can just if we can just simply believe what God Said just believe what he said and the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God that bases it your faith has got a foundation why cuz God promised it yes God promised it now you see one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible was the one we studied on in Hebrews chapter 6 and and boy that's something that'll preach that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us God wants you to believe him so much that he gave us these two things that the god that cannot lie made a promise and we just we just kind of reiterate that over and over again that you can believe what God said if God said that you can have the Holy Ghost you can have it if God said you can have the Capstone you can have it we just got to believe it now so we're basing we're basing our faith not on just some man's idea but on the word of God and you look through all these scriptures that I've got outlined here that prove to us that the word of God is not just a man's idea like second Timothy that says all scripture all scripture even Mark 16 that a lot of people want to toss out is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reprove for correction for instruction and righteousness in Romans chapter 4 the the the promise that of Abraham was not all these things that were written about Abraham was not given for his sake alone that it was imputed to him him but for us also if we can have faith like Abraham did it'll be imputed to us for righteousness so these things that are written in the Bible were written for us yes Romans chapter 15 says for whatsoever things were written a four time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope that's right second Peter says knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation that that's kind of an odd language to use but that means that it didn't come from just some somebody's idea it's not brother Bob's idea that he's preaching it's not even brother brandom's idea it but it it came from he said the Bible says that the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so I think that should give us confidence this morning as we study out the scripture we're not studying out the ideas of a man but these are the this is by inspiration of the Holy Ghost and brother BR would say over and I got all these list of things he said about to build up our faith if God said it it will be that way no matter how ridiculous it sounds if God said it he means it he is the way he keeps his word it's up to him to see it through not you to see it through it's him to see it through he keeps his word amen that chokes us up sometimes doesn't it I mean lot we we'll say we believe it but do we really believe it do we really believe that he keeps his word when troubles come when Strife comes when we get in a little place of Despair or whatever do we really believe that he keeps his word if God said it his characteristics will produce what he said and where can you put your faith on anything else but the word amen if God said it hold your finger to it that's true if God said said it oh you see why the Bible is is a life to a Christian because we it it it that's what that's where we get our strength and our our our power in in the midst of of of bad times because you can hang on everything that God said he said if God said it there's bound to be a womb somewhere for it to fall into in another place he said how could we doubt it if God said it just as true as those Prophecies of Daniel had to be fulfilled as true as God lives every word has to be fulfilled and in another place he said if God said it will be there he's able to put it there right that's how strong brother Brandon believed in faith that if you believe that your pocket knife's going to be in your pocket if you believe it it'll be there right see we get choked up sometimes by faith if God said it was going to rain then that meant it was going to rain you you say it's the truth God said so if God said it that's right I believe it it's to me the faith anchors in my heart and I believe it and I call those things that are not as though they were because God said so that's what Paul meant when he said and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of not Things Not Seen our faith is based upon the word of God how do you get Faith how how do you get more faith you say I want I want more faith to overcome this morning well faith comes by hearing the word and then you do like in the greatest battle ever fought you do like that little eagle and you start confessing what Jesus said cuz you're not confessing the words of a man you saying he said it he said it and I believe it I believe I believe I'm Healed I believe I believe God gave the promise and you say it and you you going to come out of the egg like the little Eagle did cuz you're saying his words oh you you try that and I challenge you and see if see if something don't start happening you take God at his word cuz if God said it his words are true amen and persevering he said when a man gets his answer from God there is nothing going to stop him most people today as I will repeat myself from last night saying they have hope instead of Faith you find people coming on the platform they're just built up in hopes now now hope is good cuz we want when you're in a bad spot you want hope you want to be able to okay there there's a there's a way out but faith is when you got the way out faith is Hope is when you're look oh thank God God there's there's a there's a there's somebody that could got the key that can get me out of my prison cell but faith is when you you got the way out faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence it's not a myth it's not imagination it's something you've got you've already got it and you're just as happy with it that Faith you have as you would be if you had the sub in your hand right oh you think about that now if you're if you're needing healing in your body this morning or whatever you know we got all kinds of knees U help with our paycheck help the food getting food on the table but if you got faith that'll make you happy because even though you don't see the manifestation yet you've already got it that that's why fa faith is so real that it's just it is the very evidence that the thing that you're believing in is coming and not because some imag in your mind but because you know that God promised it you're basing it on what God promised and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said faith is the subject right now that we have under consideration what is Faith it's just as much different as it is day and night between Faith and Hope for the Bible in Hebrews the 13th chapter said for faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen it's not just a mythical hope it's absolutely a substance and he said oh I hope you see this and then you'll see things happen that's what separates us I believe we're believing something's going to happen if you if you maybe you've been going going through life and and not expecting something to happen I I hope that this morning that your your your mind you're will change that you you got a different look on things this morning expect something to happen expect God to do great things in your life why because he promised it if he promised something if he promised it and it's laying there in the word now you might have to fight for it you might have to battle for it but it's yours and you can do like G Caleb and say well God promised me this mountain so I'm going get it so this morning settle it in your mind if you need something from God settle it because if he made the promise he made a way for you to get it just believe him all these all these scriptures in the Bible that build up our faith Matthew 21 all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive does that choke us up like that fellow on the plane that I was talking to if if you need something in prayer and and you got the right motive and the objective and the right reason and you can line it up with God's word you're not just asking to win the lottery or something weird because it based on your carnal desires but you can base it on the word you ask it in prayer and believe and you will get it I I I got to preaching in Nicaragua and I I started talking along those lines and I I said in my sermon that sounds fanatic that sounds a little bit crazy doesn't it and and the world will say that's that's crazy talk but we're not we're we're we're based we're basing what we believe and what we say upon the word of God that's why for any man to say these things it would be a little bit fanatical but God is the one that said it that's right in Luke chapter 1 he said for with God nothing shall be impossible even that song that brother RAM used to come out on only believe all things are possible that's that's kind of the um the the theme song of message Believers is anything is impossible in second Corinthians we walk by faith not by sight and Romans 10 says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and Hebrews 11 that we just read and Hebrews 11:6 for without faith it is impossible to to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so if you're sitting here this morning and want to please God there's no way to even please him unless you believe what he said if you believe what he said that's the way to please God that's how that's how to please anybody if I if I say something and my kids don't trust my word then then uh you know that that hurts my feelings how much how much more for God if he tells us something and we doubt him Ephesians chapter 2 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves that is the gift of God and Proverbs 3: 5-6 says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not under thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths if we're everything that we do is based on faith based on faith that if we TR trust in God that he will lead us out and the angel of the Covenant brother R said don't be scared I I hope in the last five minutes that we got five more minutes I I hope these things that I'm saying are are building up your faith as you're hearing them don't be scared he said that's the reason you can't receive is because you're afraid it won't happen see we we we need to be expecting that something's going to happen we get scared that if we believe it won't happen and then you can't have faith that way right and Faith cometh by here and he said maybe sickness has beat you down to a place you hardly haven't got any strength anymore maybe you're so blind you can hardly see can't can't see maybe you're so sick you can't hardly get up but just apply that promise thus sayith the Lord you said whatever things I desire when I pray believe I receive it for me to receive it and accept it as if it was already done now now let's let's apply that this morning if you've got a complex this morning if you can't uh exercise your gift in church because you got beat down or something and you got all these things Weighing on your mind there's a promise in the Bible that you can be delivered of that for me to receive it and accept it as if it was already done it's already done you realize what that means that that if you you don't have to fight the battle the battle's already been fought for you the mighty conqueror has gone before and died on the cross for your healing for your salvation for everything and now all you got to do is just follow behind him and go go claim what he has already possessed now see you the hard part's already done for me to receive it and accept it as if it was already done believe it now for I have faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen I believe it Lord and Faith coming by here he said God will look right down in your heart and see that promises that promise and diseases will melt back from side to side cripples will walk blind will see deaf will hear dumb will speak why they have taken God at his word yes sir Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God well brother Bob I don't think that's for me it it is for you it's it's speaking about you whatever you have need of the promises of God are so great that no matter what your situation no matter what your trouble no matter what your mind battle the promises of God Trump everything no matter what the devil has heaped heaped on your head no matter how long you've been sick the promises of God are true and we'll just stop right there faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen God bless you [Applause] Saints
