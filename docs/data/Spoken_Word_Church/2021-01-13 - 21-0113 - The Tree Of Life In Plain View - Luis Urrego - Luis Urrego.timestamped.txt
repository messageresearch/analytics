[4:27] i encourage you to read that and uh and
[4:30] really consider and we appreciate
[4:31] brother ryan doing that
[4:33] taking it because i'm sure that took a
[4:35] long time to do
[4:37] it took a long time to do so i wanted to
[4:39] get those two things out there
[4:41] and so before we read the word so let's
[4:44] turn to
[4:44] the scriptures this this evening we want
[4:47] to go to
[4:48] genesis chapter two genesis chapter two
[4:52] verse seven through nine and uh
[4:55] i wanted to revisit this uh this
[4:58] uh this message again from when i
[5:01] preached uh
[5:02] last month about the tree of life i've
[5:05] just been looking at it a little bit
[5:07] more
[5:08] and uh and just the lord has been
[5:10] working with me on that and
[5:12] last time when i preached it didn't i
[5:14] didn't get to
[5:16] show some of the quotes and some of the
[5:17] things and uh so
[5:19] i wanted to go into a little bit more
[5:20] detail with it so
[5:22] uh so if you feel like well i've already
[5:24] heard this well
[5:25] you could hear it again and you get a
[5:27] double portion
[5:28] just you're going to receive however you
[5:31] what attitude you have towards the word
[5:32] that's how you're going to receive the
[5:34] word
[5:34] so so this is how the lord i felt led to
[5:38] go so you just pray for me this evening
[5:40] amen
[5:41] so let's just let's just bow our heads
[5:43] before we read the word our heavenly
[5:45] father we come before you lord jesus we
[5:47] thank you once again for the opportunity
[5:49] that you give us lord to open back the
[5:51] pages of your word father
[5:53] we know that you are the same yesterday
[5:55] today and forever lord

[5:59] minds may think father god things get
[6:01] old things get

[6:17] for our sins if there be anything that
[6:18] would hinder
[6:19] the service lord may you forgive us

[6:24] for we know that under that blood
[6:25] there's power father
[6:27] and lord we ask now that you would just
[6:29] help us lord
[6:30] help us to understand this material this
[6:33] word lord
[6:34] god let it not just be father god head
[6:36] knowledge to our heads
[6:37] lord but father god let us look into it
[6:40] closely and apply it to our lives lord
[6:43] for the time is at hand father god and i
[6:45] believe that
[6:46] and i know my brethren believe it with
[6:48] all their hearts lord
[6:49] we commit ourselves now unto you and we
[6:52] thank you father god
[6:53] in jesus christ's name amen amen
[6:56] genesis chapter 2 verses 7 through 9 and
[6:59] then
[7:00] verses 15 15-17 it says
[7:03] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[7:05] of the ground
[7:06] and breathed into his nostrils the
[7:08] breath of life
[7:10] and man became a living soul
[7:14] amen so he had eternal life
[7:17] in that soul right and the lord god
[7:19] planted a garden eastward in eden
[7:22] and there he put the man whom he had
[7:24] formed
[7:25] and thou and out of the ground made the
[7:28] lord god to grow
[7:29] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[7:33] and good for food the tree of life also
[7:37] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[7:39] of knowledge of good
[7:41] and evil and the lord god took the man
[7:44] and put him into the garden of eden to
[7:46] dress it
[7:47] and to keep it this is verse 15. and the
[7:49] lord god commanded the man saying of
[7:51] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[7:53] freely eat but of the tree of the
[7:55] knowledge of good and
[7:56] evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[7:59] day that thou eatest
[8:01] thereof thou shalt surely die now let's
[8:04] read revelations chapter 2 verse 7
[8:06] it says he that hath an ear let him hear
[8:10] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[8:12] to him that overcometh watch to him that
[8:16] overcometh
[8:17] will i give to eat of the tree of life
[8:20] amen
[8:22] amen which is in the midst of the
[8:24] paradise of god
[8:26] amen you may be seated this evening what
[8:28] a privilege
[8:29] amen in this hour that we have
[8:32] that we have access to the to the tree
[8:35] of life in this hour amen do you believe
[8:37] that
[8:38] i believe that with all our hearts amen
[8:41] amen the word has come in our day the
[8:43] the god has done uh what he could
[8:46] what you know what more can he do as the
[8:49] song says
[8:50] what more can he do there's nothing more
[8:51] there's nothing else that you can do now
[8:53] it's in your lap what are you going to
[8:54] do with that word
[8:56] what are you going to do with this
[8:57] christ amen what are you going to do
[8:59] with him in your life amen do you want
[9:01] more of him that you may
[9:02] obtain a full inheritance or a full
[9:05] redemption of
[9:06] not just your soul but of your body amen
[9:09] because that's what we're looking
[9:10] forward to in this hour amen
[9:12] over the redemption we have our souls
[9:14] redeemed amen
[9:15] we have eternal life in our soul but now
[9:17] we're waiting for eternal life for our
[9:19] bodies amen
[9:20] something that adam had the opportunity
[9:24] to obtain but did not obtain
[9:26] exactly but through our lord jesus
[9:28] christ we were able to
[9:29] we're able to in this hour amen praise
[9:32] god amen so
[9:33] um last time we were talking about and i
[9:36] had called the the
[9:37] the message uh all access granted
[9:41] and the reason why i called it that's
[9:43] because it is open
[9:44] full access to that tree in this hour
[9:47] and and and if you don't partake of the
[9:50] tree it's not god's fault
[9:53] it's your fault that you don't obtain
[9:55] the benefits of the tree amen
[9:58] because it's it's all axis amen and i
[10:00] gave the example of when you
[10:02] nowadays when we try to access something
[10:04] on the computer or when you're trying to
[10:06] access something on your phone
[10:07] you see and you oh and you try to open
[10:09] up your phone maybe you have to put a
[10:11] certain password in
[10:12] well if you're putting your pa a wrong
[10:14] password in
[10:16] or if it's not recognizing your face
[10:18] because it's not your face
[10:21] or you got a beard on your face
[10:23] [Laughter]
[10:26] just messing around brother bob but if
[10:29] it doesn't recognize you you
[10:30] you won't have access to what you need
[10:33] to obtain inside your phone right
[10:35] or tablet or whatever and same thing
[10:38] with god amen if he doesn't recognize
[10:41] his own image amen
[10:43] by the word through his word amen if he
[10:45] doesn't recognize himself amen you can't
[10:47] access
[10:48] anything of his benefits in your life
[10:50] amen
[10:51] he he's not going to recognize your
[10:53] deeds your own deeds he's not going to
[10:55] recognize what you can do amen but he
[10:57] only recognizes what christ can do or
[11:00] what he has already done
[11:01] through your life and if you're
[11:02] dependent on that amen then he can bless
[11:05] you and you have full access to his word
[11:07] amen
[11:07] full access to his benefits full access
[11:09] to his blessings praise god
[11:12] amen when you type in that password in
[11:14] and you get
[11:15] access amen you have full access to
[11:17] everything right
[11:19] supposedly i mean nowadays you got all
[11:21] these different
[11:22] different uh roles and all these
[11:24] different things now with computers so
[11:27] but that's the that's the whole line of
[11:29] thinking of that
[11:30] now the word access it means uh it means
[11:34] permission
[11:35] liberty or ability to enter or approach
[11:38] or pass to and from a place or to
[11:41] approach or communicate with a person
[11:44] or a thing yeah i like that to
[11:47] communicate with a person or thing
[11:48] freedom or ability to obtain
[11:51] or make use of something right amen
[11:55] god has given us freedom in this hour
[11:57] amen
[11:58] through him through him through through
[12:01] through him amen
[12:03] a way of me or means of entering or
[12:06] approaching
[12:07] right amen we appreciate him for for
[12:10] what he's done and
[12:11] amen and we have so much to be thankful
[12:13] for in this hour amen
[12:16] because hey man he's taking care of it
[12:19] yes
[12:20] he's taking care of it and it's so we
[12:23] could just
[12:24] if we could just get into that man if we
[12:26] could just get into that you know i
[12:28] i realize now more and more that um
[12:32] you know it really in this hour it
[12:35] has to take a revelation for anybody to
[12:38] get
[12:38] the word of god right if you don't get a
[12:41] revelation
[12:42] you're not going to understand the word
[12:44] of god
[12:45] is i i've just come down with people
[12:47] that i've talked to in the last few days
[12:49] even someone that
[12:50] at work that i was talking to yesterday
[12:53] and
[12:54] i just i was just telling him plainly
[12:56] about the message of the hour
[12:58] and just testifying to him pretty much
[13:00] talked for about an hour
[13:03] and it just boils down to if it's not
[13:06] open to you
[13:07] you're not going to understand it and
[13:09] and you can still be coming to this
[13:11] church here or any other message church
[13:13] for that matter
[13:15] and if you don't get what's going on
[13:18] it's because it hasn't been revealed to
[13:20] you
[13:21] it just boils down to that and you need
[13:24] to pray and we need to pray for
[13:25] revelation
[13:27] we we brother branham said revelation is
[13:30] the greatest thing that the church can
[13:32] have
[13:33] amen if your the word of god is not
[13:35] revealed to you it's going to be
[13:37] boring to you every single time you come
[13:40] to church
[13:41] and and i don't blame you because you
[13:43] don't understand it
[13:45] you haven't seen the whole picture but
[13:47] to us that have seen the whole picture
[13:49] we don't have an excuse to just sit
[13:50] there and just you know
[13:52] amen we we we got to serve god amen
[13:55] we have the full access open amen to us
[13:58] praise god
[13:59] praise the lord jesus so what is this
[14:01] tree of life amen that
[14:03] and and we talked about how this tree
[14:05] the word the phrase the tree of life
[14:08] is mentioned six times in the bible
[14:10] right only six times
[14:12] the phrase the tree of life
[14:15] now you have phrases the phrase a tree
[14:18] of life
[14:19] that's mentioned a few times and you see
[14:21] that um
[14:22] in proverbs and uh and also like in
[14:25] psalms
[14:26] uh you see the phrase a tree of life but
[14:29] only six times you find in the in the
[14:31] bible where it says the
[14:32] tree of life and then this and these six
[14:35] times three times as mentioned in
[14:36] genesis
[14:37] three times as mentioned in in
[14:38] revelation glory
[14:40] praise god now brother brown talks about
[14:42] this you go back and read this in the
[14:44] in the church age book that's where i
[14:45] got all that from but he talks about
[14:47] that
[14:48] and so and so uh
[14:51] these two books are the two books that
[14:54] satan attacks the most
[14:56] the book of genesis and the book of
[14:58] revelations
[15:00] so if he attacks both of these books the
[15:02] most
[15:03] then what is it that he's trying to keep
[15:06] us away from
[15:06] that's right you see the way has been
[15:10] opened to the tree of life but he
[15:12] is trying to keep us away from that tree
[15:14] of life
[15:15] you see now brother brown says in the in
[15:18] the in the
[15:19] in the church age book he says have you
[15:21] ever noticed how satan hates two books
[15:23] of the bible more than all others
[15:25] through liberal theologians and
[15:26] pseudoscientists he is always attacking
[15:28] the book of genesis and the book of
[15:30] revelation
[15:31] in both of these books we find watch we
[15:34] find satan's origin
[15:36] his awful ways and his destruction
[15:39] he doesn't like to be reminded about
[15:41] what he what his what his
[15:43] end will be i wouldn't either if i was
[15:46] in his shoes
[15:47] right you know that is why he attacks
[15:51] them
[15:52] he hates to be exposed and in those
[15:55] books he is exposed for exactly what he
[15:58] is have you ever
[15:58] noticed that when you expose something
[16:00] in somebody's life
[16:02] they personally start attacking you
[16:08] you bring something to light right they
[16:11] immediately the attacks go on you a per
[16:13] start person
[16:14] and you start getting personally
[16:15] attacked and you start getting called
[16:17] names and you're this that and the other
[16:19] why
[16:20] that's exactly what satan's doing
[16:21] because he's being exposed
[16:23] jesus said about satan he has no part in
[16:26] me and i have no part in him the devil
[16:28] would like to prove that different
[16:30] but he cannot so he does all he can to
[16:33] destroy
[16:34] confidence in the word right that's what
[16:37] he's trying to do in this hour
[16:39] and he's doing it he's working overtime
[16:42] i've always said he does his job better
[16:44] than we do ours
[16:47] he's 24 7 a devil and he does a good job
[16:50] at it
[16:51] and i salute him for that but
[16:54] you and i what are we doing when we have
[16:57] access to this full word
[16:59] right and we get lazy and we get laxed
[17:01] and we get
[17:02] nonchalant and we forget where he has
[17:05] we've come from and where we're going
[17:06] too
[17:07] remember he's he god has also told us
[17:10] where we're going
[17:11] what our what our what our and it will
[17:14] be amen
[17:15] that should excite us that should that
[17:17] should make us to act
[17:18] just as satan acts because he knows what
[17:21] his end is that
[17:22] the word of god should make us act
[17:24] because we know where we're going
[17:25] right we know the the story we know how
[17:27] the book the book ends and in reality
[17:29] the book doesn't end
[17:32] the book will continue amen continue for
[17:35] eternity it's a life
[17:37] but when the church watch this now but
[17:39] when the church disbelieves satan
[17:43] and believes the spirit's revelation
[17:46] of the word the gates of hell
[17:50] cannot prevail against her
[17:54] all right i'm going to read that again
[17:55] but when the church disbelieves
[17:57] satan and believes the spirit's
[18:01] revelation of the word
[18:03] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[18:05] her you notice how what he said there
[18:07] that believes the rev the revelation of
[18:10] the word
[18:11] not just believe the word but the
[18:13] revelation of the word
[18:15] because you can believe the word many a
[18:18] drunk here can believe the word
[18:20] but doesn't they may not really believe
[18:23] the revelation of the word
[18:25] and that's two different things remember
[18:27] revelation will cause you to act
[18:31] revelation will cause you to live a
[18:33] certain way
[18:35] amen when you when you know beyond the
[18:37] shadow of doubt
[18:39] that something that you're something
[18:42] about yourself
[18:43] that he said about you when you know
[18:45] beyond the shadow of the doubt
[18:47] something in your life amen there's
[18:49] nothing that can take that away from you
[18:52] you saw it with your own eyes amen
[18:55] that's what revelation is praise god
[18:59] amen so we see that that word that word
[19:02] that phrase the tree of life is
[19:03] mentioned in the bible six times
[19:06] and uh and we talked we talked about how
[19:09] it's interesting you know that this is
[19:11] six times this the this phrase is
[19:14] mentioned in the bible
[19:16] three in genesis three in revelation the
[19:18] number six being the number of
[19:20] man very interesting amen
[19:24] and the and and we know that that if you
[19:27] know the numerology amen in the bible
[19:29] the number three is perfection
[19:31] the number five means grace the number
[19:34] seven is completeness or completion
[19:37] the number eight means new life
[19:39] resurrection new beginning
[19:40] eternal life amen and so in between
[19:44] there is the number six which is the
[19:45] number of man so
[19:47] that means amen that this tree of life
[19:49] has a relation
[19:50] to man praise god has a relationship a
[19:54] relation to man
[19:56] even the tree of the tree of knowledge
[19:58] of good and evil has a relation to man
[19:59] as well
[20:00] brother branham mentions that in in the
[20:02] message
[20:03] and so in all six of these places amen
[20:07] we talked about
[20:08] how in all six of these places it
[20:10] signifies the same thing
[20:12] it's it's a person right the tree of
[20:14] life is a person amen
[20:16] we'll go into a little bit more detail
[20:17] about this you know
[20:19] psalms chapter 1 verse 3 it says and he
[20:21] shall be planted like a tree
[20:23] uh he shall be like a tree planted by
[20:26] the rivers of water
[20:27] now this is that's that's an example of
[20:28] the bible mentioning
[20:30] mentioning uh planet like a uh he shall
[20:34] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[20:35] water
[20:36] um i'm sorry
[20:40] that's that's just one example of where
[20:42] god talks about man being a tree amen
[20:45] the other example we gave was when the
[20:47] when jesus healed that blind man
[20:50] and he said and when he opened his eyes
[20:52] he said i see man as trees you see
[20:54] so god is always typing man to trees
[20:57] amen
[20:57] that's that's that that we represent
[21:00] trees and even to
[21:01] wood if you look in the scriptures and
[21:03] you look at wood
[21:04] and even the things the the the the wood
[21:07] that
[21:08] that noah used amen and for the boat and
[21:10] all that
[21:11] that all types uh humanity you see
[21:14] type types man so we could go all day
[21:17] with that but uh
[21:19] we'll maybe touch that some other time
[21:21] so
[21:22] um so this
[21:25] this tree of life amen we know that it's
[21:27] a person and
[21:28] and and this person amen is the
[21:30] originator of life
[21:32] right that is that that this tree of
[21:34] life is amen the originator of of
[21:37] of of is the source of all life amen
[21:40] praise god i'm so thankful that we serve
[21:42] the god who is the source of all life
[21:45] amen all life man it's not
[21:48] you know the god that the the that the
[21:51] muhammadans
[21:52] uh worship amen that that six armed
[21:55] god i think is sheba or whatever
[21:57] whatever the name is
[21:58] that's not the source of all life maybe
[22:01] they might think that but that's not the
[22:02] source of all life you know
[22:04] uh whatever god you may have out there
[22:07] you know and you can have a god
[22:08] out of anything denominations it can be
[22:11] a god in your life amen but that's not
[22:13] the source of life
[22:14] and you knew that you know that man if
[22:16] you ever were about out in denominations
[22:18] i mean i i was out in
[22:20] in almost seven of them that's why i say
[22:22] i go i went through the seven church
[22:23] ages before i came to the message
[22:26] amen i there was no life there
[22:29] i just following my mom and dad wherever
[22:30] they went
[22:32] but i always say it was just god trying
[22:34] to deal with them and leading them to
[22:36] truth
[22:37] amen there's no life in politics
[22:41] goodness gracious we we can see that
[22:43] this year more than ever
[22:46] how now more than ever i realize what
[22:50] brother branham said in the 1960s about
[22:52] politics
[22:53] i mean that that right there just
[22:55] clinches the nail on that
[22:57] exactly right it is rotten to the core
[22:59] you don't even know what to believe i i
[23:01] got people telling me now
[23:03] i don't even know what to believe now i
[23:05] don't even know what to do
[23:06] i said well trust the word that's right
[23:08] you see that's exactly what god is
[23:10] trying to
[23:11] god is allowing all these things so that
[23:13] we can stop putting our confidence on
[23:14] these
[23:15] politics all these politicians on trump
[23:18] and
[23:18] bidens and all these people i have no
[23:20] confidence in that
[23:22] they all will fail you amen we see that
[23:25] they've failed
[23:27] the word of god has never failed you
[23:28] though so go back to the word
[23:31] go back to the tree of life that's open
[23:34] to go back to that amen politics will
[23:38] fail you sports
[23:39] will fail you there's no life in sports
[23:41] i mean those
[23:42] sports stars now i mean they're bound
[23:44] their need just like
[23:45] to to to to the politics you know and uh
[23:49] to all these
[23:50] all these all these systems that they
[23:52] got going you know now
[23:53] uh just bound their knee in and then
[23:55] they'll do whatever because they they
[23:57] get paid by them you know
[23:59] they just they just do whatever they
[24:00] tell they tell them to do
[24:02] i don't know you know in their heart if
[24:03] they believe what they do
[24:05] but they bow their knees anyways
[24:09] amen there's no life in partying
[24:12] alcohol drugs you know those of you who
[24:16] have gone through those lives there's no
[24:17] life in that
[24:18] right i remember remember that story
[24:20] where brother branham saw that lady
[24:22] you know that young girl she was half
[24:25] naked
[24:26] through the through the hotel through
[24:27] the hotel lobby or through the hotel
[24:29] owl and she was talking with a with some
[24:32] beer in her hand and screaming oh there
[24:34] will be this is life
[24:36] and he said that's death right that's
[24:39] death
[24:40] yet they think it's life
[24:45] there's no life and there's no life in
[24:48] sexual things you know you've
[24:51] you know those of you those of you
[24:53] who've who've
[24:54] who are married and you know all that
[24:57] passes
[24:58] right the only life is in christ
[25:01] the only true enjoyment is in christ
[25:03] amen
[25:05] praise god
[25:08] amen so john chapter 6 through 8 amen
[25:12] declares to us
[25:13] jesus there was declaring to us that he
[25:15] is that a source of eternal life amen he
[25:18] called himself the bread of heaven
[25:20] and the water of life amen amen because
[25:23] if we drink from him
[25:24] you would live forever amen praise god
[25:29] and so this life is in his son in first
[25:30] john chapter 5 verse 11 it states
[25:33] and this is the record that god hath
[25:36] given to
[25:37] us eternal life
[25:40] and this life is in his son
[25:43] that's why you have to be in him and
[25:45] when you're in him he's in you
[25:48] amen and when he's in you you're in him
[25:51] praise god he that hath the son verse 12
[25:55] he that hath the son
[25:56] hath life you see
[25:59] i don't there's no space there there's
[26:01] no room there for
[26:02] politics or anything he that hath the
[26:05] son hath life
[26:06] and he that hath not the son of god hath
[26:09] not
[26:10] life amen i can't get it make it be more
[26:14] clear than that
[26:15] amen praise god amen
[26:18] aren't you thankful for that the true
[26:19] trees amen the true trees
[26:21] and let's talk about these two trees
[26:23] here for just a moment in genesis
[26:24] chapter 2 verses 8 through 9
[26:27] and the lord god planted a garden
[26:28] eastward in eden
[26:30] and there he put the man whom he had
[26:32] formed and
[26:33] out of the ground made the lord god to
[26:36] grow every tree
[26:38] that is pleasant to the sight now i want
[26:40] you to notice
[26:41] amen maybe for those who who are just
[26:43] coming in
[26:44] you know and trying to understand this
[26:46] word every tree that is pleasant to the
[26:49] sight
[26:49] and good for food the tree of life also
[26:52] in the midst of the garden
[26:54] now notice he differentiates the between
[26:57] those two trees between the trees that
[26:58] were good for food
[27:00] and then he goes in and says and this is
[27:02] a semicolon
[27:03] the tree of life also in the midst of
[27:07] the garden
[27:08] right right amen and the tree of
[27:10] knowledge of good
[27:12] and evil amen so there was trees in
[27:14] there that were good for food
[27:16] but then there was also a tree in there
[27:18] there was the tree of life
[27:21] that was totally different from these
[27:23] trees
[27:25] you see and then this tree amen was
[27:28] totally different from this tree as well
[27:30] amen
[27:30] praise god right so so we want that we
[27:34] we we want to make sure that we
[27:36] understand that those two trees were
[27:38] persons amen because those trees were in
[27:42] the
[27:43] was they're standing they were in the
[27:45] midst of the garden
[27:46] amen the tree of life was a person then
[27:49] if the tree of life was a person then
[27:51] logically that must mean that the tree
[27:53] of knowledge of good and evil is a
[27:54] person too
[27:55] right he believed that i mean
[27:59] brother brown taught all these things
[28:00] amen ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13
[28:03] tells us talking about satan thou has
[28:06] been in eden the garden of god
[28:09] amen satan was in the garden of eden
[28:12] right
[28:12] obviously he anointed the serpent
[28:16] to do what he did amen praise god
[28:19] so man was to live
[28:23] amen they were the the food that they
[28:26] ate
[28:26] at that time from those trees was was
[28:29] not to fill their bellies and for them
[28:30] to live
[28:31] right it was just for their enjoyment
[28:34] amen exactly it was it wasn't for like
[28:37] the way we eat now amen do you know that
[28:39] we go
[28:39] i'm so hungry you know i can't you know
[28:42] i was so hungry the other day we we got
[28:44] to use that texas roadhouse card brother
[28:46] brother
[28:46] brother wade brother wade gave us a
[28:50] uh a little texas roadhouse gift card
[28:52] for christmas and
[28:54] and uh uh i guess he gave to all the
[28:56] sunday school
[28:58] but uh got to use it on monday
[29:01] at uh uh in in knoxville tennessee
[29:04] i was hungry we had been driving already
[29:07] maybe five
[29:07] hours or so and uh man i was hungry but
[29:11] i was waiting
[29:12] out i was holding off and man when i got
[29:15] there you know
[29:16] uh we had me some good uh i don't even
[29:18] forget what i ate but
[29:20] it was good though so good
[29:23] and we had leftovers for the next day
[29:29] but what was funny is that what what
[29:30] christine ordered was
[29:32] almost just as much as the gift card was
[29:34] [Laughter]
[29:37] again she ordered a big old rack of ribs
[29:42] and i always tell i always tell and i i
[29:44] was telling the uh a server there in
[29:46] panama city florida uh
[29:47] the other day i said you know every my
[29:50] wife orders these the big
[29:51] plates and when they come and serve the
[29:54] server comes and gives us the food
[29:55] he always gives me the big plate
[29:57] thinking that i was the one to order it
[29:58] but it's really her i'm the one who
[30:01] ordered the smaller one
[30:04] but she does it because she wants to use
[30:05] she shares it with with zoey
[30:08] and so it all works out
[30:11] but uh anyways
[30:14] so adam was not to eat
[30:18] to survive right we we know that well
[30:20] today we eat to survive
[30:23] but the he was to continue to eat from
[30:26] that tree of life amen
[30:28] all right from that from that person
[30:32] just as we are supposed to continue
[30:34] eating from that tree of life to
[30:36] even today amen how you get
[30:39] now remember adam was not eternal in his
[30:43] in his body adam only had eternal life
[30:46] in his soul
[30:48] therefore there was a purpose for him to
[30:50] continually eat off the tree of life
[30:54] amen just as we as born again christians
[30:57] we have eternal life in our soul
[31:00] we're not eternal on the outside or
[31:02] spirit
[31:03] but if we continue to eat from the tree
[31:06] of life we're heading to that body
[31:08] change amen
[31:09] praise god just as adam was supposed to
[31:13] go there
[31:14] amen now brother brahm says in the
[31:17] message
[31:18] in the ephesian church age watch he says
[31:20] this god's intention for his creation
[31:24] man is to express his words
[31:28] wow this is the intention of god in
[31:31] genesis
[31:32] adam was given the word to live by
[31:35] right he was given the tree of life to
[31:38] live by because the tree of life is the
[31:39] word
[31:40] and the word is christ a life lived
[31:43] by the word would be the word expressed
[31:47] amen i'd like to read that again a life
[31:49] lived
[31:50] by the word would be the word expressed
[31:53] amen when you are living the word amen
[31:56] when you're expressing the word that
[31:57] means you're expressing the expressed
[31:59] god
[32:00] right amen praise the lord
[32:04] he says is that true or not but did adam
[32:07] live by that word
[32:10] no because he was to live by every word
[32:14] and he failed to take heed to every word
[32:17] amen he gave up his inheritance he gave
[32:21] up his
[32:22] his his his right to the tree of life
[32:26] amen to to do what he did and we
[32:29] we know what what happened there in the
[32:31] story amen
[32:33] so we are to be living amen by the every
[32:36] word
[32:37] in order to truly be the word expressed
[32:40] not just part word not just half word
[32:43] not just what you like of the word it
[32:45] has to be a full word in this hour
[32:48] in order for us to obtain a full
[32:52] inheritance or a full redemption amen
[32:56] all right i i wanna honestly get that
[32:59] again it's gotta be the full word
[33:01] in order for us to obtain a full
[33:03] redemption
[33:05] you see what i'm saying amen now god
[33:08] wants this
[33:10] more he wants this badly just as much as
[33:13] you and i want it
[33:14] right amen in ephesians chapter one
[33:17] verses four through eleven
[33:18] we don't we're not i'm not reading the
[33:19] whole thing but watch what's the
[33:22] the things that he says in the in these
[33:24] in these verses he says
[33:25] that we should be holy and without blame
[33:27] before him in love
[33:29] he wants us to obtain that he wants us
[33:32] to be blameless
[33:34] we're the ones who sometimes condemn
[33:36] ourselves and keep condemning
[33:37] ourselves and keep bringing ourselves
[33:39] down and we can't do it and i can't do
[33:41] it i can't live this christian life
[33:43] i can't i can't i can't i can i can't
[33:46] when god is is rooting for you all the
[33:49] whole time
[33:52] he's got more grace than you could ever
[33:54] imagine that he has
[33:57] praise god because he knows you love him
[34:00] and he knows that your desire is for him
[34:03] even though you're in this falling
[34:04] condition see that we should be holy and
[34:07] without blame before him in love
[34:09] listen in verse 5 there haven't
[34:11] predestinated us
[34:13] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[34:15] christ himself
[34:16] it doesn't say that he will predestinate
[34:18] us having predestinated
[34:20] us in the past
[34:23] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[34:25] christ to himself
[34:28] not to another and then verse 6 talks
[34:31] about wherein he hath made us
[34:32] accepted in the beloved glory he
[34:36] i i like how paul words it because it's
[34:38] all past tense
[34:40] right hath accepted right
[34:44] half done it's already taken care of
[34:47] glory
[34:47] you're the one who who who stops that
[34:50] from working in your life
[34:51] right it's you and i
[34:54] but to god it's already done as the song
[34:57] goes it's already done
[35:00] amen verse 7 in whom
[35:03] we have present tense
[35:06] in whom we have redemption through his
[35:08] blood right
[35:10] the forgiveness of sins verse 8 talks
[35:12] about
[35:13] he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[35:17] and prudence i just hear
[35:20] positivity the whole time i don't hear
[35:23] any negativity about you and i
[35:26] so why are we being negative towards
[35:28] each other ones we should be negative to
[35:30] us towards
[35:31] the toward the devil amen
[35:35] having made known unto us the mystery
[35:37] listen having made
[35:38] known unto us the mystery of his will
[35:43] we we have a an open book in this house
[35:47] right it's not a closed book
[35:50] it's an open book as john was given in
[35:52] revelations chapter 10
[35:54] and john types to bride amen verse 10
[35:58] it says he he might gather together in
[36:00] one
[36:01] all things in christ both which are in
[36:03] heaven and which are on earth
[36:05] even in him see you're part of all those
[36:09] things
[36:10] amen and verse 11 there it says in whom
[36:13] also we have obtained
[36:15] an inheritance again being predestinated
[36:19] right being predestinated amen so i read
[36:22] that and i just read positivity you know
[36:24] that that right there is is is
[36:28] is those books that you know that you
[36:30] try to be you know get positivity from
[36:32] and all this
[36:33] there's my positivity word for the day
[36:36] right there
[36:37] my uh i forgot what they call it the uh
[36:41] i can't remember the the when you when
[36:43] you say something
[36:45] and you speak yeah positive thinking
[36:48] there you go
[36:49] that's more than positive thinking to me
[36:51] that's positive living right there
[36:54] amen praise god
[36:57] amen so adam had eternal life in his
[37:00] soul
[37:02] now let's keep this in mind but not
[37:04] eternal life in his body
[37:06] all right remember that he had eternal
[37:09] life in his soul but not in his body
[37:11] so in order for adam a man to obtain
[37:14] eternal life in his body
[37:16] amen he had to continue eating from that
[37:18] tree of life
[37:20] praise god amen
[37:24] and so see adam and eve they fell from
[37:26] their original estate
[37:28] right right they were supposed to
[37:30] continue
[37:31] if they they kept eating god told them
[37:33] amen that if
[37:35] that day that you eat thereof amen that
[37:37] day you will surely die
[37:40] now uh
[37:43] oh that day that they would eat from the
[37:44] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[37:46] not from the tree of life amen they
[37:48] would keep living from the tree of life
[37:50] but it's from the tree of knowledge of
[37:51] good and evil that they would die that
[37:53] day
[37:54] now did they literally die no no
[37:58] amen but their bodies started to die for
[38:00] sure
[38:02] amen their bodies started and dying out
[38:04] they also died
[38:05] spiritually but now you have to watch
[38:07] how you say that too
[38:10] because they did not lose eternal life
[38:12] in their soul
[38:14] amen they still kept eternal life in
[38:17] their soul
[38:18] i want to read a quote here where
[38:19] brother branham talks about that amen
[38:21] they still had eternal life in their
[38:22] soul
[38:23] but they lost they lost that
[38:26] that relationship with god just as a few
[38:29] if you're walking with christ and then
[38:31] you start devin with the things of the
[38:32] world and you start going into
[38:34] into living for yourself your
[38:37] relationship with christ is going to
[38:39] suffer
[38:40] your relationship from that tree that
[38:42] tree of life becomes further and further
[38:45] away from you
[38:46] now that tree is not closer and closer
[38:48] to you're getting away
[38:49] from that tree but that tree stays still
[38:52] where you last left it
[38:53] right and wherever you last left it if
[38:56] you go back to it that's where you'll
[38:57] find it
[38:58] you see but that's what happened to adam
[39:02] and eve
[39:02] they they they died spiritually that's
[39:05] why they went and hid
[39:06] right they said uh you know god was
[39:09] saying we're out thou adam adam we're
[39:11] our dogs not that he didn't know where
[39:13] adam was he knew where adam was
[39:15] brother branham says that he wanted to
[39:16] make sure that adam knew where he was at
[39:18] right in what position and what
[39:21] condition he was in
[39:23] and when you recognize what condition
[39:25] you're in amen
[39:26] then god can help you but if you don't
[39:29] recognize
[39:30] where in the position and the condition
[39:32] that you're in
[39:33] and you think that you're doing good and
[39:35] you're living okay when in reality you
[39:37] know that you need him
[39:39] he can't help you because remember he
[39:42] doesn't force you to do anything that
[39:44] you don't want to do
[39:45] right that's why he gave us free moral
[39:48] agency
[39:50] you decide and according to your desire
[39:53] that's how he'll do amen but i'm so
[39:56] thankful for predestination
[39:59] amen because
[40:02] because by predestination amen he'll
[40:04] make sure that
[40:06] the way will be provided that you come
[40:07] to it amen praise god
[40:10] that you make the right decision right
[40:14] amen so so remember the fact that
[40:17] adam and eve died
[40:20] spiritually that did not take that
[40:23] eternal
[40:24] life that they already had in their soul
[40:26] amen amen
[40:27] amen that's why adam he continued to be
[40:29] the son of a son of god amen
[40:31] amen but he did not come to that
[40:34] redemption of that body
[40:36] but you see it wasn't god's plan for it
[40:38] to be that way
[40:39] amen now i want to read here a quote and
[40:42] uh
[40:43] and the brothers could bring it up uh
[40:46] blasphemous names brother brown says
[40:48] here see
[40:50] if and if you've got life without end
[40:53] how can you perish
[40:57] you have become a part of the eternal
[41:00] and there's only one thing eternal right
[41:04] but satan is not eternal i'm so thankful
[41:07] for that
[41:09] that's why he's not your brother
[41:12] no he becomes satan hell is not eternal
[41:17] amen hell was created right it's not
[41:20] eternal and watch and these bodies
[41:24] are not eternal referring to our body
[41:27] our physical bodies they were created
[41:30] right amen they were created
[41:34] but the spirit of god is eternal
[41:37] it never had a beginning or it never has
[41:40] an
[41:40] end and the only way we can have eternal
[41:42] life from the greek word zoe
[41:44] which means god's own life we have we
[41:47] become a part of god when we become sons
[41:50] and daughters of god
[41:51] and we have an enos life
[41:54] so the part that lives that lives us
[41:57] that recognizes this word from here to
[41:59] there that recognizes
[42:01] aeneas life life without end it's god's
[42:05] own life in us
[42:06] amen now watch this
[42:09] but what god did he breathed the breath
[42:12] of eternal life amen
[42:14] then he become a living soul watch a
[42:17] soul that can't die
[42:21] see a soul that can't die now watch now
[42:25] we're going to get into honey plum to
[42:26] your elbows he says
[42:29] notice he breathed the breath of eternal
[42:32] life
[42:32] into his nostrils into adam's nostrils
[42:36] and he became an eternal soul glory
[42:40] because god breathed not what nature
[42:43] done
[42:45] but what god did right watch br
[42:48] he breathed the breath of eternal life
[42:50] into his nostrils and he become
[42:52] a living soul so that
[42:55] is what gave god adam an eternal soul
[42:59] right right are we are we together on
[43:02] that amen
[43:04] now watch what brother man says then you
[43:06] say to me adam adam died brother branham
[43:09] but remember before adam died
[43:13] he had a lamb that redeemed him
[43:17] amen
[43:20] before adam died he had a lamb that
[43:23] redeemed him
[43:24] those who he foreknew he has called
[43:27] he got a lamb to redeem them he was a
[43:30] type adam fell
[43:32] watch then the lamb was provided for
[43:34] adam because already
[43:36] in his nostrils had become the breath of
[43:39] eternal god and he become a living soul
[43:41] he was a son of god
[43:42] amen amen so
[43:46] adam had eternal life amen in his soul
[43:50] when he when he fell he did not lose his
[43:53] eternal life in his
[43:54] soul why because the lamb was already
[43:57] slain before the foundation of the world
[43:59] amen the lamb jesus christ or in other
[44:02] words
[44:03] but but here's the thing it wasn't
[44:05] physically slain
[44:08] it was in the mind of god but eventually
[44:10] it would come to pass
[44:12] see in the mind of god when things
[44:14] happen
[44:16] it's like it's already done right and
[44:19] it's connected to that eternal life
[44:21] amen that's why adam could not fall from
[44:24] eternal life and his soul because it was
[44:26] already
[44:27] how could god breathe eternal life into
[44:29] him to his soul
[44:31] and he and then he and then he he takes
[44:33] away his eternal life that
[44:36] that's what brother brown said to be
[44:37] like an indian giver
[44:39] when i give you a gift if or if you give
[44:41] me a gift amen you gave it to me
[44:44] you didn't let me borrow it that's why
[44:47] it's called a gift
[44:48] you gave it to me you didn't let me
[44:51] borrow the gift so
[44:52] you can't ask me let me have my gift
[44:54] back because it's not your gift
[44:56] it's my gift and same thing with god
[44:58] amen he gave you eternal life in your
[45:01] soul
[45:01] so he's not going to take it back
[45:03] because it's yours
[45:04] because it's connected to him amen
[45:07] praise god
[45:10] you understand what i'm saying you
[45:12] understand what brother brandon was
[45:13] talking about
[45:14] and i believe brother dale has been
[45:15] bringing this out too
[45:20] but dale i think we've been kind of in
[45:21] the same line because this right here
[45:24] i had to preach to uh some believers in
[45:27] uh
[45:28] uh two weeks ago in in europe uh we i
[45:30] preached online
[45:32] and uh to some believers in portugal and
[45:34] spain and
[45:36] in germany and uh so i went on the same
[45:39] line
[45:40] but before i started i started uh i
[45:42] started reading
[45:43] i started i started looking at this and
[45:46] i found i found that quote because i i
[45:48] thought maybe that they might stumble
[45:50] on this i said i said i said lord let me
[45:53] find something that
[45:54] that that they would they would they
[45:56] would point that the
[45:57] the lamb was slain before and that's why
[45:59] adam could not lose his eternal life and
[46:01] his soul
[46:02] and i came down exactly to this quote
[46:05] and then coming back from ohio amen
[46:07] and brother dale's i was listening to
[46:08] the services and brother dale's
[46:10] preaching about the same exact thing
[46:13] amen so so i just thank god for that
[46:15] amen
[46:17] it's the word
[46:20] amen praise god
[46:25] to me that that opens up the picture
[46:27] even more further
[46:29] and it should to you don't look at it
[46:31] just quotes
[46:32] look at it as life glory if you could
[46:35] keep log
[46:36] he's just reading quotes and he just
[46:38] keeps reading quotes but you're not
[46:39] you're not reading the quotes you're
[46:41] just looking at them
[46:43] read the quotes and i believe it'll
[46:45] change you
[46:46] you want to understand the word right
[46:48] you want to come you want to understand
[46:49] the word right
[46:50] i don't know of anyone here that does
[46:53] not want to understand the word even
[46:54] further
[46:55] not just understand it but have it
[46:57] revealed to you
[46:58] but you have to pay attention in order
[47:01] for there to be a revelation
[47:03] [Music]
[47:04] pay attention so that you may obtain
[47:06] revelation amen
[47:08] praise god so adam and eve we
[47:11] see that eventually they got ahead of
[47:13] the plan of god
[47:16] you see they got ahead of the plan of
[47:18] god and
[47:19] and the same thing with you and i when
[47:20] you get ahead of god's plan when you
[47:22] start reasoning with god's word
[47:24] amen there's nothing but death after
[47:25] that
[47:27] you see what happened with eve amen when
[47:29] she started reasoning with god's word
[47:30] when's when satan came to her through
[47:32] the serpent
[47:33] and said thou shall not surely die right
[47:36] right
[47:37] all he did was added one word in there
[47:40] satan never comes with you to you with
[47:43] 40 percent truth
[47:45] and the rest of it lie he always comes
[47:47] to you with 99.9
[47:49] truth it's that little percentage that
[47:52] that that that's deceiving and that
[47:55] causes you
[47:56] to reason the word right if you're not
[47:58] careful
[48:01] if you're not careful in this hour we
[48:02] are living in an hour where people
[48:05] are are are being fed that little point
[48:10] one percent right and that's causing
[48:13] them to
[48:13] reason things out
[48:17] that's why what brother wade's been
[48:19] preaching you know that
[48:20] this thing's so close right that it'll
[48:23] deceive the very elected
[48:25] if it was possible these two trees in
[48:27] the garden mingled with each other
[48:31] you see there was an atom there was
[48:33] there was a there was a
[48:35] cane and an abel you see there was a
[48:38] jacob and an esau
[48:40] in the bible very close then they even
[48:43] come to the
[48:44] to jesus and and and and judas
[48:47] so close no you couldn't tell that judas
[48:49] was a devil
[48:50] even though jesus had already said that
[48:52] there was a devil amongst them
[48:55] he said i chose you 12 and one of you is
[48:58] a devil he said
[49:00] but you can tell which one was the devil
[49:02] right same thing today
[49:04] you can't tell which one is the devil
[49:06] you'll be able to tell when you discern
[49:08] that that person is off
[49:10] point point one percent of the word
[49:12] right that's right
[49:13] remember it has to be full word in order
[49:16] to obtain a full redemption not
[49:18] not point not not 99.9 percent word it
[49:21] has to be
[49:22] 100 percent worth amen praise god
[49:28] amen and and same thing with
[49:32] with with and i just want to interject
[49:34] this because
[49:36] we have our young people today and young
[49:38] people in this church that are seeking
[49:40] marriage in their life right now
[49:41] maybe seeking seek going through those
[49:44] those stages in life
[49:46] and i just want i want to encourage you
[49:49] to be careful
[49:51] all right to be careful the choices that
[49:54] you make
[49:55] it's you by by you having
[49:59] you know feeling that you want a a
[50:01] partner in life and
[50:02] and having those desires that's all very
[50:05] normal
[50:06] there's nothing bad about that none of
[50:09] that is bad and none of that
[50:11] is abnormal and each and every one of us
[50:15] went through those same stages in life
[50:17] as brothers and as sisters
[50:20] nothing wrong with that but it's what
[50:22] you do and it's what you allow
[50:24] for those feelings to take over you
[50:28] and that you that you get ahead of the
[50:30] plan of god and then you
[50:31] make a mess out of your life because
[50:34] those feelings are real
[50:35] right and if you know what i mean those
[50:38] those who are older
[50:40] those feelings are real and if you don't
[50:43] hold and control them
[50:44] they're going to get you in trouble
[50:47] they're going to get you in trouble
[50:48] don't get ahead of the plan of god like
[50:50] eve did
[50:51] see eve got ahead of the plan of god
[50:54] and it felt good for the moment but it
[50:57] caused death
[50:58] right all right i just plain being raw
[51:00] with you
[51:02] all right because i feel that you're
[51:05] grown up and i feel that you understand
[51:07] that
[51:08] amen don't go and some of us
[51:11] probably in life went through that got
[51:14] ahead of the plan
[51:16] and it wasn't the same right sure god
[51:19] you know
[51:20] there's a permissive will in in life
[51:22] that god gives you
[51:24] but my is so certainly so nice to be
[51:27] able to live in god it's
[51:28] perfect will like sister gabby and
[51:30] brother ryan amen did i believe
[51:33] that god led them to amen and that's why
[51:36] i encourage you to read that that that
[51:38] that testimony that he gave praise god
[51:43] in ecclesiastes chapter three verse one
[51:45] it tells us to everything there is
[51:47] a season and they time to every purpose
[51:51] under heaven so there's a time
[51:54] for marriage there's a time for these
[51:57] other things amen that supposed to take
[52:00] place it's after marriage
[52:02] not before marriage i'm just telling you
[52:05] this because i know satan's sly
[52:07] [Laughter]
[52:09] satan is it wants to destroy your life
[52:11] and does not want
[52:13] for you to to he because if he can
[52:15] destroy your life that way that means
[52:17] then he can strike he starts destroying
[52:19] your life spiritually
[52:20] right because now you don't want to come
[52:22] to church
[52:23] see when when you're not serving god and
[52:25] when you're doing things behind
[52:27] your your back parents back and doing
[52:30] the things that you're not supposed to
[52:31] be doing
[52:32] you don't want to come to church because
[52:33] you feel guilty
[52:35] you don't want to you want you don't
[52:37] want to serve god you know what's right
[52:40] but you don't want to fully give in
[52:42] because you feel guilty
[52:43] and because you don't want your parents
[52:45] maybe to realize that what you've been
[52:47] engaging in
[52:48] so then you just act out a certain part
[52:51] you see and you act like everything is
[52:55] okay
[52:56] when in reality it's not and in reality
[52:59] you know what you got to do
[53:00] just be free if you know that you've
[53:03] done wrong or whatever just
[53:05] just let it go let give yourself to god
[53:09] and and let him
[53:10] take care of it and be free it doesn't
[53:13] matter who
[53:14] what happens just be free amen in christ
[53:18] serve him because the hour is late amen
[53:22] the hour is late and it's not time to
[53:24] play games
[53:26] and i i'm not saying that because i know
[53:28] something or nothing like that i'm just
[53:30] encouraging you hey man i'm encouraging
[53:33] you as because we have younger people
[53:34] that are coming up
[53:36] into those stages now amen that goes for
[53:39] my daughters too
[53:40] she just turned 14. and
[53:44] i know that she's gonna have those those
[53:46] those
[53:47] wanting to have a boyfriend and things
[53:49] like that you know
[53:51] but i gotta i gotta i gotta let
[53:55] i gotta let them know about these things
[53:56] she's over there looking at me looking
[54:00] all right i'll i'll i'll shut it
[54:03] all right so getting back to the to the
[54:06] to this tree of life amen so this first
[54:08] adam
[54:09] he never obtained eternal life for his
[54:11] body
[54:13] amen due to his unbelief to the word and
[54:15] he lost access to the tree of life
[54:18] so we read in genesis chapter 3 verse 24
[54:20] so he drove
[54:21] out the man god drove out the man god
[54:24] drove out adam
[54:25] and he placed it at the east of the
[54:27] garden of eden cherubims
[54:30] and the flaming sword which turned every
[54:32] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[54:35] so it was kept you see the way of the
[54:37] tree of life was guarded
[54:39] now brother branham even ties in this
[54:41] flaming sword
[54:42] which turned everywhere he ties it into
[54:44] even the the the beasts
[54:46] the four combat beasts amen turning in
[54:48] every wave for the east
[54:50] north west and south amen and uh
[54:53] they were they they were they were there
[54:56] to keep the way the
[54:57] the tree of life because look uh uh
[55:01] god says uh in in verse 22 there genesis
[55:05] chapter 3 says and the lord god said
[55:06] behold a man has become as one of us
[55:08] to know good and evil you see and now
[55:12] lest he put forth his hand and take
[55:14] also of the tree of life and eat and
[55:17] live forever
[55:19] you see so god was trying to prevent
[55:21] them from
[55:22] eating in that in that condition that
[55:25] they were in
[55:27] but they were not as brother dale's been
[55:28] bringing out they were not to
[55:30] it was not to live eternally but to live
[55:33] forever the bible
[55:34] says there you see
[55:37] god god was was was hindering from that
[55:39] to happen brother brown says in the in
[55:41] the breach between the seven church ages
[55:43] and the seven seals
[55:44] adam lost his inheritance the earth
[55:46] exactly
[55:47] all right and not just the physic not
[55:49] just this earth
[55:50] but the body the change of the body he
[55:54] lost
[55:54] that amen praise god
[55:57] now it passed from his hand to the one
[56:00] he sold out to
[56:02] which was satan he sold his faith and
[56:05] god to satan's reasonings
[56:08] therefore his eternal life his right to
[56:11] the tree of life his right to the earth
[56:14] belonged to him it belonged to him
[56:17] and he forfeited every bit to the hands
[56:20] of satan
[56:22] he passed it from his hand to satan
[56:25] therefore now it has been it returned
[56:28] and has been polluted
[56:30] and the seed of adam has destroyed the
[56:32] inheritance
[56:33] that adam should have had that's the
[56:36] earth
[56:37] amen the seed amen
[56:40] now adam's seed praise god
[56:45] it has destroyed that inheritance
[56:49] that's why sex doesn't bring us back
[56:52] right do you see what i'm saying
[56:55] sex was what caused the problem and sex
[56:58] can't redeem you back to it
[57:00] as raw as that sounds it can't because
[57:03] there's some people that even kind of
[57:04] think that way
[57:05] and even kind of preach on those lines
[57:07] they can't bring you back to that
[57:09] that's what polluted the whole thing god
[57:11] exactly
[57:12] you see right praise god
[57:16] amen so at that point there was no there
[57:18] was no way to have access to that tree
[57:21] of life again in its fullness
[57:23] i'm so glad you all are paying attention
[57:25] i don't see one person sleeping tonight
[57:27] that's wonderful
[57:28] i you know i'm gonna give y'all a clap
[57:31] [Laughter]
[57:33] amen
[57:36] that's wonderful i know it's hard on
[57:40] wednesday night
[57:41] i mean the other night i was having a
[57:43] problem and
[57:45] you know it's tough i was having an
[57:47] issue staying awake it's tough i
[57:49] understand but
[57:50] i hope that you're enjoying the word you
[57:52] know and it's not me it's the word
[57:56] amen we have a few for a little bit more
[57:58] just just hang on with me because i got
[58:00] i
[58:00] i have some things here uh this
[58:03] wonderful
[58:04] thing that i read today that just
[58:05] blessed my soul
[58:07] so there was no way to have access to
[58:09] that tree of life again
[58:10] but why watch there was no way to have
[58:12] access to that tree of life again in its
[58:14] fullness
[58:15] right you see throughout all the
[58:18] ages or throughout even before christ
[58:20] came on the scene the
[58:22] prophets and the abraham and all the
[58:25] the davids the daniels they have they
[58:28] had a
[58:29] form you know of salvation they were
[58:31] able to touch god and god was able to
[58:33] work in their lives
[58:34] so it wasn't that they were completely
[58:36] restricted you know from the
[58:38] but there was no born-again uh uh a
[58:41] process in their life and and definitely
[58:44] no no
[58:45] no way for them to obtain even
[58:46] redemption for their bodies
[58:48] they were looking at these things from
[58:50] far off right
[58:51] and they were desiring it amen but now
[58:54] we are looking at it right
[58:56] there in the pinnacle of it amen we're
[58:58] right here
[58:59] right on top of it just looking at it i
[59:02] mean it's it's it's here
[59:04] it's not that it's coming it's here and
[59:06] it's just got to manifest from the
[59:07] inside
[59:08] out amen saints praise god
[59:12] because god is ever present right amen
[59:16] praise god and last time we talked about
[59:17] the tabernacle of moses amen and i won't
[59:20] go into that just to save time amen but
[59:22] we know what happened in the tabernacle
[59:23] of moses only
[59:25] one the priest could only go in there
[59:26] into the holy of holies
[59:28] even even the other the other priests
[59:31] amen they could only go
[59:32] to to to us to the the the holy place
[59:36] there was the curtain there that's as
[59:38] far as they got
[59:40] but the priest one time the high priest
[59:42] one
[59:43] which jesus christ is the high priest of
[59:45] our redemption amen
[59:47] he could go in there with blood amen and
[59:50] back there be able to have full access
[59:52] amen to what to the blessings of god
[59:55] amen
[59:56] now even then you see the the the
[1:00:00] the uh the tabernacle of moses
[1:00:04] that and that wasn't even the full
[1:00:06] access to the tree of life neither
[1:00:08] exactly as powerful as that was right
[1:00:11] i mean could you imagine can you imagine
[1:00:13] you being a high priest going back in
[1:00:15] the back
[1:00:16] in the in the behind the curtain and
[1:00:18] being able to partake of that original
[1:00:20] manna
[1:00:21] that fell the first time they had a
[1:00:24] little bit of that mana still there
[1:00:26] and it was always being renewed it was
[1:00:29] it never spoiled behind that curtain
[1:00:31] because the presence of god was always
[1:00:33] there so you could always partake of it
[1:00:36] on a yearly basis when the high priest
[1:00:38] would go in there with blood
[1:00:40] amen they would he would always see that
[1:00:42] tree that limb
[1:00:43] amen that rod aaron's rod budding
[1:00:46] and it was not even connected to a tree
[1:00:51] it was a tree it was a branch not even
[1:00:55] connected to a tree
[1:00:56] and as i said last time but yet it was
[1:00:58] connected to a tree
[1:01:00] because the tree of life was back there
[1:01:02] amen the presence amen the glory of god
[1:01:06] the word of god was back there moses ten
[1:01:08] commandments oh my it was just
[1:01:10] just wonderful goodness i mean you could
[1:01:13] you could talk so much about the word of
[1:01:15] god and
[1:01:16] it's just it's all so interconnected
[1:01:18] it's it's beautiful i don't see how we
[1:01:20] can get bored
[1:01:21] amen praise god
[1:01:24] amen so that that's why the second adam
[1:01:27] jesus christ
[1:01:28] the word came himself to do what adam
[1:01:31] failed to do
[1:01:32] right now we're going back to to what
[1:01:34] jesus did now see the first adam
[1:01:36] failed here comes the second adam which
[1:01:38] is jesus christ amen
[1:01:40] and jesus hey man he defeated the enemy
[1:01:43] by the word
[1:01:45] the way adam was supposed to defeat the
[1:01:47] enemy by the word
[1:01:48] right he failed in doing that because he
[1:01:51] didn't take
[1:01:52] all the word but jesus christ amen he
[1:01:56] he defeated the enemy by the full word
[1:01:59] because he was the word that's why it
[1:02:01] had to be god to come down and rescue
[1:02:03] you and say man it wasn't a sun that he
[1:02:05] sent
[1:02:06] it was god himself that came down to die
[1:02:08] for you and me
[1:02:10] and to save you and die it was god
[1:02:13] himself amen through a virgin birth
[1:02:16] the bible says that it was jehovah amen
[1:02:19] it was
[1:02:19] god god with us emmanuel
[1:02:23] even as a baby that was god with us
[1:02:26] because he jesus christ didn't come the
[1:02:28] same way that even adam
[1:02:30] came right he came he came the way
[1:02:33] we came except it wasn't through what
[1:02:36] man and woman did
[1:02:37] it was what god did in the in the womb
[1:02:39] of mary but you see
[1:02:40] because he came through a womb of a
[1:02:44] woman because that's how we come to this
[1:02:46] earth
[1:02:47] because he needed to be a kinsmen
[1:02:49] redeemer
[1:02:50] do you see what i'm saying that's why he
[1:02:53] had to come that way
[1:02:57] amen praise god so he came amen
[1:03:01] jesus defeated the enemy by the word he
[1:03:04] died
[1:03:05] and resurrected in order to obtain
[1:03:08] eternal life
[1:03:09] for his own body and for our souls and
[1:03:12] bodies
[1:03:14] amen praise god
[1:03:18] amen we can read that in romans 6 5 for
[1:03:20] if we have been planted together in the
[1:03:21] likeness of his death
[1:03:23] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:03:24] resurrection
[1:03:26] romans 6 8 says now if we be dead with
[1:03:28] christ we believe that we shall
[1:03:30] also live with him right colossians 3 1
[1:03:33] if ye then be risen with christ
[1:03:35] seek those things which are above where
[1:03:36] christ sitteth on the right hand of god
[1:03:39] amen watch what brother branham says
[1:03:40] here in the true easter seal i'm trying
[1:03:42] to go a little quickly now and your
[1:03:44] limbs aching and the little mothers with
[1:03:46] their babies and dads and aged
[1:03:48] and all waiting watching watching to see
[1:03:50] one sign of the living god
[1:03:52] then see him moving on the scene and
[1:03:54] prove that he's jehovah
[1:03:56] that he's jesus the resurrected one i'm
[1:03:59] alive forevermore in the keys
[1:04:01] and have the keys of death and help
[1:04:02] because he broke the seal of it
[1:04:04] he broke the seal of death he broke the
[1:04:06] seal of the tomb
[1:04:08] he broke the seal of hell he broke the
[1:04:11] seal of the grave
[1:04:12] and he opened the seal to the tree of
[1:04:14] life
[1:04:15] amen and watched and baptized us by his
[1:04:19] holy spirit
[1:04:20] into that tree of life and made us sons
[1:04:24] and daughters of god amen
[1:04:27] so now it's not just touching it or or
[1:04:29] just looking at the tree of life from
[1:04:31] far off amen now it's having that tree
[1:04:33] of life in us
[1:04:34] and you being in that tree
[1:04:37] remember it's not a literal tree it's a
[1:04:40] it's a person
[1:04:41] the person of christ amen that's what
[1:04:44] that tree of life is
[1:04:46] praise god and so we now
[1:04:49] today we have that promise of not just
[1:04:51] receiving eternal life in our soul but
[1:04:53] also eternal life on our physical bodies
[1:04:56] amen because he's the one who broke the
[1:04:58] seal of death hell in the grave
[1:05:01] amen and was the head and was the first
[1:05:04] fruits of the resurrection
[1:05:06] the head amen what do we always say i
[1:05:09] was mentioning this to the brothers in
[1:05:10] in portugal there what comes up from
[1:05:13] your pillow first
[1:05:14] when you wake up in the morning it's
[1:05:16] your head
[1:05:17] it's not your arm unless like you know
[1:05:20] maybe some of us that might come off
[1:05:22] like this you know dragging from the
[1:05:24] and it might be your arm it might be
[1:05:25] your leg i don't know it depends on how
[1:05:27] you wake up
[1:05:28] but a normal person wakes up
[1:05:32] their pillow their head off the pillow
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:36] and that's exactly what christ did he's
[1:05:39] the one who came up first because he is
[1:05:41] the head
[1:05:42] glory right and the body then
[1:05:45] follows what the head does what the
[1:05:48] intelligence does
[1:05:50] that's the reason if he raised from the
[1:05:51] dead amen then we must rise from the
[1:05:54] dead
[1:05:54] and if he received redemption in his
[1:05:56] body then we must receive
[1:05:58] redemption in our bodies as well hey
[1:06:00] we're cut
[1:06:01] we're in that process right now saints i
[1:06:04] believe that with all my heart exactly
[1:06:06] right
[1:06:07] the process is taking place right now
[1:06:09] and it's happening faster than we think
[1:06:13] so it's not time to play games with god
[1:06:18] it's time to get serious with god this
[1:06:20] word is coming
[1:06:21] as being revealed even quicker than amen
[1:06:24] glory
[1:06:25] he said he said that he would
[1:06:28] amen but the key thing is is for that
[1:06:30] process amen to take place from the
[1:06:33] from your soul right from the inside out
[1:06:36] exactly right
[1:06:36] that's the key remember what we talked
[1:06:38] about when we were talking about the
[1:06:39] kingdom of god
[1:06:40] the kingdom of god which is the the life
[1:06:43] of god this tree of life
[1:06:46] that's the kingdom of god it has to be a
[1:06:49] man
[1:06:49] rooted it has to be rooted first it has
[1:06:51] to be found at first
[1:06:52] in you that it can then be manifested on
[1:06:55] the outside
[1:06:56] you're not gonna you're not gonna take
[1:06:58] over earth and you're not going to
[1:07:00] possess the earth amen your earth and
[1:07:02] this earth
[1:07:03] if you've not possessed a man if you
[1:07:05] don't have the possession in your soul
[1:07:07] do you see what i'm saying you're not
[1:07:09] going to come here amen
[1:07:11] if you don't know how to even possess
[1:07:13] your own body
[1:07:14] how to overcome temptations how to
[1:07:17] overcome yourself
[1:07:18] how to overcome bad thoughts how to
[1:07:20] overcome all these things how are you
[1:07:21] going to overcome the
[1:07:22] the elements you see
[1:07:26] amen so that way to the tree of life it
[1:07:30] has been restored saints brother watch
[1:07:33] brother brown says in the in the in the
[1:07:35] resume of the ages
[1:07:36] but there are no cherubim flaming swords
[1:07:39] to guard the tree of life now
[1:07:42] amen there's no there's no the cherubims
[1:07:44] have been removed
[1:07:46] because christ has already re removed
[1:07:49] the seal
[1:07:50] of that tree of life now it's
[1:07:53] whosoever will come amen it's
[1:07:56] axis is open amen brother brown says oh
[1:07:59] come
[1:08:00] take the tree of life now instead of the
[1:08:03] cherubims now i want to say something
[1:08:04] instead of those cherubians guarding
[1:08:06] this throne
[1:08:07] they're out here seeking trying to run
[1:08:09] people
[1:08:10] guard them to the throne trying to bring
[1:08:12] them through the gate
[1:08:13] back to the tree of life again that they
[1:08:15] might take this
[1:08:17] and that's exactly what god is trying to
[1:08:18] do in this hour amen and i believe all
[1:08:20] this
[1:08:20] all this stuff with the virus and
[1:08:22] everything that's going on around us
[1:08:24] is what god is trying to do to take us
[1:08:25] back to this tree of life
[1:08:28] amen and when you're dependent on on on
[1:08:30] what you can get out of life when you're
[1:08:32] dependent on your bank account and on
[1:08:33] the money that you have in the bank
[1:08:35] and your plans and everything amen
[1:08:38] god amen goes in there and just shakes
[1:08:40] that nest
[1:08:41] and says amen you got a tree of life to
[1:08:43] look to right
[1:08:45] you don't look to these things of life
[1:08:47] you don't look to donald trump and you
[1:08:48] don't look to politics and you don't
[1:08:50] look to none of this amen
[1:08:51] you've got something better to look
[1:08:52] ahead to look to
[1:08:54] yes and it's that thing that god has
[1:08:57] given you in the new birth
[1:08:59] look to that which is the word supposed
[1:09:02] to be the word in you amen to manifest
[1:09:05] on the outside
[1:09:07] to a full redemption in the body amen
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:10] revelations 2 7 and we just we read it
[1:09:13] but we will read it again
[1:09:14] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:09:16] the spirit saith
[1:09:18] unto the churches watch to him that
[1:09:20] overcometh will i give to eat of the
[1:09:22] tree of life
[1:09:24] it's to him that overcometh amen
[1:09:27] the thing is is that we want to we want
[1:09:29] to be called overcomers and we have not
[1:09:31] even overcome anything
[1:09:32] right amen there's something that you
[1:09:36] and i
[1:09:36] must overcome in this hour and the main
[1:09:39] thing
[1:09:40] is overcoming ourselves amen it's the
[1:09:43] greatest enemy that we have
[1:09:44] because satan comes in and anoints us
[1:09:47] amen anoints us
[1:09:48] amen but we must overcome ourselves
[1:09:50] we're the greatest enemy that we look at
[1:09:52] everyone in the in the mirror
[1:09:55] satan can't make you do anything right
[1:09:58] you're the one to decide if you're going
[1:10:00] to do it or not
[1:10:02] if you're going to think it or not if
[1:10:04] you're going to say it or not
[1:10:06] you're it's your decision amen
[1:10:10] but remember every time that you don't
[1:10:12] it's like you just
[1:10:13] punch satan in the face and gave him a
[1:10:16] big black
[1:10:17] eye you see
[1:10:22] and then you do it again the next day
[1:10:25] and it's another black card to satan's
[1:10:27] eye you see
[1:10:30] on a daily basis keep giving him black
[1:10:32] eyes amen
[1:10:35] with the decisions that you make amen
[1:10:39] praise god
[1:10:43] to him that overcometh amen but the
[1:10:45] thing is is that
[1:10:46] the overcomer should already be in you
[1:10:49] right
[1:10:49] right but you can't do it on your own it
[1:10:52] has to be christ that already overcame
[1:10:54] he's in you
[1:10:55] that means you're an overcomer with him
[1:10:56] jesus christ is the overcomer
[1:10:58] who conquered satan death hell and the
[1:11:00] grave if jesus christ is in
[1:11:02] us in the form of the holy spirit that
[1:11:04] makes us equal overcomers with him
[1:11:06] brother brown says here he says
[1:11:08] overcomers only that overcome the beast
[1:11:11] overcome his mark that's catholicism
[1:11:14] protestantism denominationalism
[1:11:18] let me just add whirly-ism and and uh
[1:11:21] luisism and and and babism uh
[1:11:25] brother dale ism and and and brother
[1:11:27] danielism and
[1:11:28] brother whoever amen to overcome all
[1:11:31] these isms

[1:11:35] uh who overcome the beast his mark the
[1:11:38] letter of his name
[1:11:40] he'll have a right to the tree of life
[1:11:42] to enter into the gates where nothing
[1:11:44] that the files can ever go in see
[1:11:46] think of it now just a minute now as we
[1:11:49] just got a little bit farther tree of
[1:11:51] life will be for the overcomers only
[1:11:55] amen see this tree of life is only for
[1:11:58] the overcomers
[1:12:00] but god has opened the axis for
[1:12:03] whosoever will
[1:12:04] but he knows only the overcomers can
[1:12:06] come
[1:12:07] can only understand and really desire
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:10] what because they're part of it
[1:12:14] they're part of that tree by that
[1:12:16] eternal life amen
[1:12:18] romans 8 11 tells us but if the spirit
[1:12:20] of him that raised up jesus from the
[1:12:21] dead

[1:13:48] for you
[1:13:49] that's why your young people go the way
[1:13:51] they do because us parents don't
[1:13:53] understand don't know that we're
[1:13:54] supposed to do these things with them

[1:14:18] this this this is the whole
[1:14:20] summary of of of of this whole matter
[1:14:24] and i love this when i i this is the
[1:14:26] first time i read this today to be
[1:14:27] honest with you and i thought it was
[1:14:29] wonderful
[1:14:29] in the church his book the ephesian
[1:14:31] church age brother branham says this
[1:14:34] now that we have come this far let me
[1:14:36] try to crystallize your thinking on this
[1:14:38] subject so you can see the necessity of
[1:14:40] our going into the serpent seed doctrine
[1:14:42] as i have
[1:14:44] we start with the fact that there were
[1:14:46] two trees in the midst of the garden
[1:14:49] the tree of life was jesus all right the
[1:14:52] other tree
[1:14:52] is definitely satan because of what came
[1:14:55] forth of the fruit of that tree
[1:14:58] now then we know that both of those
[1:15:01] trees had a relationship to man
[1:15:04] or they would never have been placed
[1:15:05] there
[1:15:07] all right they must have had a part in
[1:15:10] the sovereign plan
[1:15:11] and purpose of god in their relationship
[1:15:13] to mankind
[1:15:15] and to himself or we could never
[1:15:18] impute omniscience unto god in other
[1:15:21] words amen they
[1:15:22] they must have been related to man in
[1:15:25] some way
[1:15:26] or otherwise god would not have known
[1:15:27] anything all things
[1:15:29] and we know that he does that's why he's
[1:15:31] called an omniscient
[1:15:32] god amen because he's ever present and
[1:15:35] because he's ever present amen that's
[1:15:36] why he
[1:15:37] makes him omniscient amen now watch
[1:15:40] now the word most definitely sets forth
[1:15:42] that from before the foundation of
[1:15:44] of the earth the purpose of god was to
[1:15:47] share his eternal life with man glory
[1:15:50] that see we talked about that that that
[1:15:52] was the desire of god from the beginning
[1:15:55] was to share his eternal life he had
[1:15:57] attributes that he wanted to express
[1:15:59] amen you and i were part of those
[1:16:01] attributes
[1:16:03] part of those eternal attributes that he
[1:16:05] wanted to express
[1:16:06] amen see now the word most definitely
[1:16:09] sets forth that from before the
[1:16:10] foundation of the earth the purpose of
[1:16:12] god was to share his eternal life with
[1:16:14] man
[1:16:15] ephesians 1 4-11 we just read that in
[1:16:18] revelations 13
[1:16:19] 8 and all that dwell upon the earth
[1:16:21] shall worship him satan whose name are
[1:16:23] not written the book of life of the lamb
[1:16:25] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:16:27] amen now watch but that life
[1:16:30] and i and i added i added this and uh in
[1:16:34] parentheses from the tree of life you
[1:16:36] see
[1:16:36] but that life from the tree of life
[1:16:39] could not and would not be shared in
[1:16:41] any other way than through the way of
[1:16:43] god
[1:16:44] manifest in the flesh this was a part of
[1:16:48] his eternal and predestinated purpose
[1:16:51] for him to come into flesh all right
[1:16:56] um this plan
[1:16:59] was to be to the praise of the glory of
[1:17:02] his grace
[1:17:03] it was the plan of redemption it was the
[1:17:06] plan of salvation
[1:17:08] now listen closely and i say that to you
[1:17:12] listen closely
[1:17:13] read closely god being a savior
[1:17:16] it was necessary that he predestinate a
[1:17:19] man
[1:17:20] who would require salvation in order to
[1:17:23] give himself reason and purpose of being
[1:17:27] amen that's why adam had to come to a
[1:17:30] sinful state
[1:17:32] that would give then god a purpose and a
[1:17:34] reason amen to do what he did for us
[1:17:37] and not just for us but he did it for
[1:17:39] adam as well
[1:17:41] but remember it had happened in the mind
[1:17:42] of god before the foundation of the
[1:17:44] world
[1:17:45] it was already done now watch that is
[1:17:48] 100
[1:17:49] correct and multitudes of scripture
[1:17:51] buried out as does the very pointed
[1:17:53] verse of romans 11 36
[1:17:55] of for of him and through him and to him
[1:17:58] are
[1:17:58] all things to whom be glory forever amen
[1:18:02] man could not directly come and partake
[1:18:05] of that tree of life in the midst of the
[1:18:07] garden
[1:18:08] they could not directly come and partake
[1:18:10] of it
[1:18:12] in in that in that sinful state that
[1:18:14] eternal life of the tree
[1:18:15] had to become flesh first right amen
[1:18:19] i love that amen that eternal life
[1:18:23] of the tree have to become flesh first
[1:18:25] in other words christ had to become
[1:18:27] flesh
[1:18:28] that so that way that man could be
[1:18:30] redeemed back to that tree amen
[1:18:32] but before god could raise and save a
[1:18:35] sinner
[1:18:36] he had to have a sinner to raise and
[1:18:38] save
[1:18:40] amen man had to fall
[1:18:43] man had to fall the fall which would be
[1:18:46] caused by satan
[1:18:47] had to have flesh to make a fault to
[1:18:49] make fall
[1:18:51] satan had to come through flesh also but
[1:18:54] satan could not come through
[1:18:55] human flesh to make the fall as would
[1:18:58] christ come in human flesh to restore
[1:19:01] the fallen
[1:19:02] see that's where satan make him he must
[1:19:04] he thought that he could
[1:19:06] interject himself into the human race by
[1:19:08] going into the serpent
[1:19:10] and and he and he did and it worked for
[1:19:14] what he thought it was going to
[1:19:15] happen you know he did what he did but
[1:19:18] it wasn't
[1:19:19] amen but he could not redeem amen
[1:19:22] like christ could come in amen right
[1:19:24] interject himself into the human
[1:19:26] race and redeem the race back to him
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:30] but there was an animal the serpent so
[1:19:32] close to man that satan could get to
[1:19:34] that beast and through that beast
[1:19:36] he could get to human flesh and cause
[1:19:38] the fall
[1:19:39] and inject himself thereby into the
[1:19:42] human race
[1:19:43] even as jesus would one day come and
[1:19:46] inject himself into the human race into
[1:19:49] human bodies
[1:19:50] even to the extent of a resurrection
[1:19:53] wherein we would have bodies like unto
[1:19:56] his glorified body
[1:19:57] amen thus what god
[1:20:01] that what god worked out here in the
[1:20:03] garden was his predestinated plan
[1:20:05] amen and when is the last part and when
[1:20:08] satan had brought about that which was
[1:20:11] necessary to the purpose of god
[1:20:13] then man could not get to the tree of
[1:20:16] life in the garden
[1:20:17] see in that condition certainly not
[1:20:20] it wasn't time amen but an
[1:20:24] animal animal had caused the fall had it
[1:20:26] not
[1:20:27] talking about the serpent let animal
[1:20:29] life be shed
[1:20:30] was taken and his blood shed and the and
[1:20:33] then god had communion with man again
[1:20:36] but you see that was that was that that
[1:20:38] physical lamb that god
[1:20:39] killed and enclothed amen uh adam and
[1:20:42] eve
[1:20:43] but that that was only just a covering
[1:20:45] for them right
[1:20:46] it wasn't it wasn't eternal it wouldn't
[1:20:49] be eternal until jesus christ come
[1:20:51] and did the sacrifice you see see god
[1:20:53] that was god's permissive will
[1:20:56] amen but god's perfect will was for
[1:21:00] them to be fully redeemed restored amen
[1:21:06] and then god had communion with man
[1:21:08] again then there was to come a day when
[1:21:10] god would appear in flesh
[1:21:13] and by means of his humiliation he would
[1:21:15] restore fallen man
[1:21:17] and make him a partaker of that eternal
[1:21:20] life
[1:21:22] once you see this you can understand the
[1:21:23] serpent seed and know that it was no
[1:21:25] apple
[1:21:26] that eve ate no it was the degradation
[1:21:30] of humanity by intermingling the seed
[1:21:33] amen praise god i thought that was
[1:21:35] wonderful
[1:21:37] and that just really summarizes
[1:21:39] everything that i've been trying to say
[1:21:40] here for the last hour and a half
[1:21:42] almost that's exactly what god's been
[1:21:46] trying to do or
[1:21:47] has done glory in this our day amen
[1:21:50] and we may have troubles on every side
[1:21:52] saints we may have problems and we see
[1:21:54] the the situation around us
[1:21:56] amen but take it as it's the tender hand
[1:21:59] of jehovah leading us to that tree of
[1:22:01] life
[1:22:03] do you see what the jews had to go
[1:22:05] through in the during the
[1:22:07] during the world war two and during that
[1:22:09] time
[1:22:10] they went through terrible things we're
[1:22:13] not
[1:22:13] we're not promised amen that we you know
[1:22:16] that
[1:22:17] that we're gonna be protected from
[1:22:18] things like that something like that
[1:22:20] could take place i don't know
[1:22:22] you know but let me tell you what you
[1:22:25] have to keep in mind that it's god's
[1:22:27] tender hand
[1:22:28] leading us amen to the full redemption
[1:22:31] of our bodies
[1:22:32] and i say lord whatever needs to happen
[1:22:35] you let it happen lord
[1:22:36] right cause the after event afterwards
[1:22:40] is more glorious than anything around us
[1:22:42] right now oh my
[1:22:45] that's more glorious and amen that's
[1:22:48] than
[1:22:48] than the things currently happening amen
