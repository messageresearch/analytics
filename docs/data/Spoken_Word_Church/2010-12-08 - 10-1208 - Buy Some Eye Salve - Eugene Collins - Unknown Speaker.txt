words here a little bit tonight and and just read just a little bit off you got your bibles like to turn over here i believe revelations the third chapter and uh about the 18th verse we want to talk a little bit here about a little strange thing called maybe the title of it about the advice of my side other night this is kind of a strange thing but it come to me and i was just frilled in my spirit uh wake up i never thought about this never really got into it but it's a revelation the third chapter in about the 18th verse you know i want to read just a little bit praise the lord and i'll let you be seated he said i canceled thee to buy of me gold tried in the farm and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint their eyes with eyesight that i may see and just think about this as many as i loved i'll rebuke and chase them these zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and sup with him and he with me does that sound good that's just our head father we thank you again tonight lord jesus for letting us come and gather here tonight with our precious family lord that you have chosen before the foundation of the earth lord our hearts are just filled with joy tonight to look out and see these precious hungry souls oh god and your little body that's gathered together lord to come into the unity of your faith father lord we just feel so little tonight to be here god to stand here behind this sacred death lord to where your servant stands lord and father that's been called into this gospel lord into this teaching and preaching of it lord to help the souls of your people lord to be matured father the lord we ask tonight that you'll help me lord to just help me get out of the way lord and father that your word could have preamps in our lives tonight god is lord that we may be able to say something lord to just say a word that will encourage this little body to be stronger lord father we'll give you all the glory and praise and we thank you for it tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated we'd like to talk on this just a little bit and i was kind of going through this the other night i woke up about two o'clock in the morning i was telling my brother never had really thought much about this little uh scripture here but you know it's just the spirit of god just kind of run it through me and it got better and better and i thought man there's a lot to do with it's a lifestyle you know because it does something for you and i just got to say lord just let me just rub it all over me anyway you know it's good for a gator if you can just get the meaning of it and i'm sure the prophet of god uh got a little taste of this you know and he really really put it in his eyes and you know i believe that god really let him be anointed with he did praise the lord and i believe tonight if god's little bride can get just make sure that we've got this rubs in our eyes real good you know and inner years and all over us you know it's good for you it just goes plumb down in your heart this is something you know they got different uh uh medicine and stuff you know it's they'll give it to you and it'll just go all through your body you know stop all the pains and you know it kind of does a great thing you take a aspen of something that's you know you're hurting any you take a aspen maybe a head or something about your body and you take that little aspen it just goes to work don't it it goes down circulates through your bloodstream and gets down in earth to where your pain's at where your suffering's in and i was thinking about this uh the other night as i was thinking about this i saved i said lord i know i got something quite a few years ago and you know it's still working today praise the lord amen and it just gets better and better you know it's just it goes all the way through you know it just it gets the moving on every part and you know it's it's good for you praise the lord i know we used to have a lot on side back when i was young you know mama and make some and it gets some i guess from different places and and you know it was good for different things you know different things about your body and sores and different things but here i believe god is referring to something else you know just like kind of like the little woman that was at the well that time when uh you know when jesus happened to be there at the time that she walked up you know and she needed something she praised the lord amen and kind like that water was you know god had to uh kind of get her attention he started off kind of the natural things but he had a spiritual meaning for her you know you know she had to find out what the water is talking about this she had to get a little taste of it you know she had a desire and had to get to a place that she that she uh when god kind of searched the heart out a little bit you know and found out a little bit about her i believe he's still doing that tonight amen i believe that the holy spirit is still the same yesterday then forever and i believe god is still the same you know i a lot of times i preach it or a little church down in lincoln i don't have to worry because well if i had a congregation like this i'd kind of be obscured to say some of the things i said but sometimes i get kind of rough you know i think well boy we just ain't got too many to pick on and i just get a big old thing in my soul sometime and i just try to put it all on them i guess felt like it man was one time he had plenty of said i got plenty of hay on the fort but you can't feed it all to one person okay you know you got to kind of take it easy on them so i just like uh me i i kind of have to look around and i ain't got a little handful so i can't hurt them too bad and they got news to me but here you know when you go out somewhere i incredible minister i've been asked that a lot of people ask me to come different places but i just you know i feel so little i just say oh my i might want to feel like that but i just don't feel like i'm qualified to speak to some of the people i just listened to some of these brothers talk here before service say amen one of them especially and just listen to him i said man i need to hear him pray praise the lord he knows about these things you know and you know you just find yourself sometime but you about you're learning you know thank god for that eyesight amen hallelujah it's a goodness to a place you know that we can or get our understanding open right i mean to say that he's talking about but it gets when you put it on your eyes it kind of opens up your eyes if you understand right and it goes all the way through down to your heart and everywhere you know it'll it'll make everything just line up praise god amen hallelujah don't take much of it you know you don't have to put it on the other day it should get a little of it i told a brother here i said backyard back in 70s i believe it was or maybe right there somewhere but god give me some of it i got some of it and i'll tell you when i did it started opening up my understanding i could see better you know like we sang your old song amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me before i found out that that scythe will open up all this amazing grace to you thank god it'll begin to open up thanks to you from one place to look it begins to show you things amen that's god has got in your head sometimes you know i found out that when i thought i used to know everything about god and all about him but after i got to looking in the scriptures and things and listened to him and especially when i heard the prophet of god i found out that i i just really had the anointing but i didn't have any understanding you know we used to have a backyard we come up these mountains up here we owned up in little hills up here and we only thing we don't we thought were boy when you got saved all you need to do is just really just get to northern you know just get really make sure you got to north and you know i knew it was good right i mean we still need that tonight though i tell you i believe sometimes we a lot of people thanks you know we just kind of don't need the anointing but we do we need that holy spirit we need god's holy ghost inside of us don't we it needs to be our leader it needs to be our teacher and uh for a while but when i got acquainted with the message i want to tell this tonight just give a little bit of my testimony and uh and then we'll forget i used to be up here i guess back forth a lot of y'all ever uh was here at the church back many years ago brother moats and brother dale i guess thank brother dale just kind of got hanging on me and i believe you just you got a little taste of this but you know what uh i've come up and i used to be with him a lot in a little building here and boy it was a blessing i couldn't hear we'd be coming up the road been some of the brothers and what was amazing about it we'd be on the same message that our brother would preach right we'd we'd be fellowshipping on the same thing coming up the road brother colleen knows about it we'd uh when we come here brother moses everyone who was here we pray and i'll tell you what that'd be open up to the bible right to where where is it talking about right before it was because we had to grow in god we had to know something about the lord jesus christ you know and and when it opened up that scripture that morning teaching or at night whenever we was here i s which listen you know cause god was speaking to us right sometimes we don't take it for granted like we should that god sometimes through the teaching of god's word and and as god's uh minister begins to you know bring it to us and begin to feed it because we ain't careful it's so easy and so simp and simplistic you know we've missed some of it that's right but oh i remember back then when we'd have our own heart and uh oh brother won't see it get up here and uh and kind of it seemed like god just tell him what to say you know because that's what her heart was crying for was hungry for something like the little lady come to the whale she really didn't understand what she was there for but before she left there she knows what she come for she found what she come for brother god sees us before we ever really get to him you know before we get our understanding open he's got a way of getting us to something ain't he praise the lord amen but we're not aware of what you see just like the scriptures that's why i believe he said search the scriptures for in them we think we have eternal life and he said these are they didn't testify with me not right you know what probably easy it was easy for me back then because i had tried to keep the anointing on my life i'd do everything i could brother to go without food you can't tell that now but back back then you know you could you know i i'd go and pray and i got it on a little film showing it to some friends of theirs the other night back up here in the mountains where i used to spend a lot of days and prayer and you know and stay back in them woods and talk to god and god would come down and just make itself real tell me in the spirit you know but i didn't have no education much i didn't have known very much but i learned about him you know right hey man i'd rather really that's the greatest education you really get right because if he can ever get you in him he can let take care of the rest of his i didn't know hardly how to read couldn't explain my words too good still can't but yes god was helping me you know he's kind of getting a place to where he could teach me amen amen and i i know uh brother gable i believe was give me some little notes here and thanks that brother dale had been teaching on up here at the church here fall back and boy i've been i was getting in there and catching some little nuggets you know and just to eating on them boy it's good for you praise the lord i'm telling you when god's got somebody that can get in here and bring out little nuggets for you and place them in here where you can see them and hear them and you know and just get the taste of them i tell you it'll do you good praise lord it does something good for you just like this i say you know he said if you buy this or or just get to ignore your eyes you know and one of these days you'll see that it's understanding to you that's right i mean it begins don't move stuff until you it goes down in here you know it's got something to do with that amazing grace hey praise god hallelujah i once was blind but now i see amen you know that's the way god is beginning he showed me these things but he began to open my eyes you know to more truth and more life because it's a time i couldn't walk in it you know i couldn't put my life in it i couldn't place myself in and i know you you probably walked in the same pathway praise the lord but there's a time that you just didn't have what you got now amen i mean you knew god probably maybe was blessed by it right but today you were able to stand you know just like a little child when he's a growing up he he wants to do what his daddy his father wants his daddy does he wants to do the things he does he wants to walk in him and work in them and do what he wants to do but yet he has to learn these things you know it's a time that god has got to let us grow into a place that we'll learn to be solid and be walking in him praise the lord because we don't walk in him like we should you know at the beginning we have we think maybe we do it's just slightly i didn't want nobody much to tell me about god because i thought the boy had all i need you know i didn't need much yet but brother i found out that there's a lot about him i just didn't know him amen and old peter one time you know i was i was thinking about him where he was telling the lord when he found out that that jesus was gonna be delivered over to hands of man to be crucified and you know that was a sad thing you know peter said tell him he said kind of rebuking the lord what lord i don't never say nothing like it don't ever meet you nothing like that how you know jesus turned around he said satan get behind me cause you don't really know what i'm trying to say to you you know what was that's kind of rebuke wasn't it it's kind of a rebuke to i mean that was kind of hard because it would be hard today you know somebody just get up and say well let's try to do the best we can and somebody come along god sent them servant of god along or something he just say well listen you you just need to sit down and listen hurt your feelings a little bit you know because we thought we knowed everything you know but i i just i just like that you know he done me i believe like he did on peter i think he maybe he didn't just speak the words to me but in one sense it was just like that he said satan just get behind me you need to listen you know right and i thought about that i said oh my i thought i knew about everything you know i knew how to pray i knew how to let the holy spirit speak through me oh i just thought the boy is i got everything i'm ready to go to heaven now and you know i i i was really i guess if god would have took me on right now and i'd believe out of me right but you know i had to do some growing and listening and just getting more settled you know right i was just a little child i thought well man if daddy had put me out there on this car i'd erect and kill myself you know i wanted to drive a car and i wanted to do what he wanted me to but i just want matured enough i just didn't understand these things because i know the first time i got in a car and tried to grind i like to tour the transmission up you know they don't scratch stick things and let my clutch out too faster and then try to stop it without pushing the clutch in you know that thing was a hard thing to learn how to do something so i thought about just like that you know to get back to the word of god that's about the way i was in the words you know i just didn't know how to do things i didn't know how to handle myself and i didn't know how to get other people to see the truth about god's word come on if i just always stayed in this shout you know it's still a bit of shot and still wanting to know that right that's right you know because we're still being going on and just having a great time because we've all like felt like a boy if you could just speak in tongues and prophesy and dancing the spirit you know and just oh it was good you know right but you never get into the knowledge of the truth like that amen i mean you can shout because they people still shout in the day they still prophesying still having great emotions and still don't know god dude i feel his spirit but they don't really know come on brother i imagine these uh pharisees and sadducees back there you know when jesus come on the scene you know and come amongst them and walking with him and you know trying to explain thanks to him i guess he thought this was a bad church full of people how can these people be so ignorant you know how could they believe what moses said why couldn't they believe what these old prophets uh prophesied back through the scriptures you know about the coming of the lord and now i'm here and they don't even know me that's right said he come to his own his own didn't even know it didn't receive him did he you know it's sad for it to be like that you know and it would have happened here in our generation if god had done something to us come on if god hadn't got this i said to us tonight and somehow another opening you know if he had to let this uh revelation of god get to us brother and sister we'd have still been carried away with all kind of ideals and opinions but and things in the spirit we want to know which way to go you know it's hard today to deal with people i've been meeting a lot of people here lately and uh some of them uh inspectors or some big churches and been having kind of little discussions with them about things and god's letting me find favor with some of them but i tell you what they look at me and say well how do you know these things you know i said well it's only takes god you have to see how god's leading you to know things you know i mean if you can't see yourself in the word and see yourself before as god has predestinated you don't place you in the word you'll never be able to go nowhere with god you've got to see your predestination don't you you got to see your calling you got to recognize what god's called you for amen what he's purposed yet and how he's placed you in here praise the lord i mean we just think somebody's just hatched out you know god had us in his mind wig that came before the foundation of the earth he's and he's been up bringing us through all this eating through the jeans and bringing us on up here you know to hear in the last days he's kind of manifested what we are that's right if he can ever get us to see a picture who we are you know and recognize who we are in him praise god then i'll tell you what we're going to have a revival brother praise god hallelujah here little grab this brother say here not long ago he said this won't have a revival he said you know i got to thinking about that he said you know how we're going to have a revival he said man we need to find out that we are the revival amen praise god that's a difference hey it ain't just getting a big crowd of people together you know and having a good singing and having a good uh thing but it's when we really see who we are and what we're doing and how we're fulfilling the purpose of god listen i'll tell you what it gets rich in a sense you begin to see where you came from and where you're going to hallelujah you know i want to see where i came from don't you i know it's good to be under i guess old he and a little wall and you know scratch around in some of the earthly things we all fulfill that purpose i guess but oh i believe god's trying to get us to lift up our wings now don't you i believe he's trying to get us to hear his voice hallelujah i believe that mother eagle that great eagle has come and screamed out to us amen i was preaching here a while back on elijah i said how elisha was a father elijah and i said you know when you go to reading this and finding all the things that elijah was in and how had gotten used to him found through the scriptures to uh to give to minister to people and give life to the people i said you know we ain't got but one source today i said we ain't got but one way to get through into life today and that's through this message amen voice of god that's the only way we're going to get there hallelujah i know we started off i believe god poured out his spirit upon all flesh and i believe everybody has had the privilege or had the opportunity of being filled with the spirit amen or getting the baptism of it i mean that you under you could just used to have revivals brother brown and all the old servants of god back counter they had great revivals that i mean far i know a lot of them i could call their names you probably know them but they had revivals they had outpourings of the spirit you know but really they hadn't become the revival no money come on you know it's different than having a outpouring of the spirit when god pours his spirit up on all flesh you know and you know what i that what really got a hold of my heart i was telling my brother here before service how did god let me get a hold of a message one time about the anointed ones at the end time because i was a kind of men my wife and we used to be at a lot of pentecostal meetings and over the different ministers and different brothers and always having great meetings and revivals and what we thought was revivals but it didn't last long you know i mean you can get healed every day and still be lost like a brother tell me he said you know a sinners you know i'll tell you what god heals sinners and everybody though you don't have to be a real holy ghost-filled person to get healed right man you can build me to start in the country and be still be healed listen that's what had me kind of blinded because i i saw this going on across the country you know and and i it got me a place i really didn't know what kind of revival to look for man i just i didn't know what to do you know but i was trying to stay with everything that i thought was moving on in god and i just got into i thought prosperity and and all this stuff you know i thought boy if you just give god a hundred dollars you'll be a millionaire you know he'll give you a new cadillac and a nice new home and all this stuff but i found that that didn't work too good you know if you give it to god it might work but i was giving most of mine to the preachers you know as well as it get rich it wasn't what the lord didn't need that you know i found that out a little later on down in my life you know because i'd give a lot of money away to kind of you know i just thought god's gonna just bless me like that i might able to get blessed you know and god saw my little weak ignorant ways but i i've done all i could i was doing all i could you know to get in the program and get in what i needed to thought that i i wanted to get to heaven i wanted to get as many people as i could in and but i going act the wrong way you know god is he's got to get us around these things sometimes and get us to show us where he's leading us to though that's kind of like peter was he thought boy i got a i know god how could you say that this thing's gonna happen to you hey could you do these things he said don't even say that because he saw so many miracles and so many banks happening all these great explosions and god the dead rays and the blind the sea and the crippled walk and he just couldn't accept this you know he said man how can a man like this going to be tucked in the hands of people to be crucified or or he took away how could this thing happen he didn't realize that was what he was doing it party he just hadn't come to the understanding to see it this was a plan of god you know amen if he hadn't done that there wouldn't have been no hope for peter would would have been no hope for you and me you know but god had to let this happen but out without understanding what he was saying he said he looked around at old peter he said satan just get behind that mean peter was a devil but he just had his mind on the wrong motive did he you know it's kind of hard for us to see that sometime because a lot of times that we we got to get our mind focused in the right pattern that when the right moment you praise the lord because that's what god had to do to me because i didn't understand these things about the water baptism and all these things god had the mysteries of god and different things about how god was to reveal himself to me i just didn't have this inside of him my thinking wasn't like that you know but god had to get around to this he had to have a way to bring me around to it he just didn't cram it all in at one time but i was in little services uh for wherever i'd go god would let me get into some of them so i got in one toughing for a while and that was my brother ned allison i don't know anybody knows him at all boy he was a real hard teacher he just about tell me he'd say satan get behind him you know because i disargued with him and i he tell me boy you just said you know you well after 63 years you couldn't really see what god was really doing you know and i just couldn't accept that i thought man i needed i had gone away back younger you know i said i told him i said you might not know brother but i know you know but he has kind of showed me something you know that i didn't understand because i had never come to the water baptism 1972 and this is when god open again don't mess up to me a big snow was on the ground about this time too you know well if you don't get in there when god wants you to he'll he'll get you in his way but there's a big snow about 17 inches deeper there's never been a snow like that in augusta georgie but i'll tell y'all sitting at the table when god began to that good old last night went to work amen thank god my understanding began to open up to the scripture praise the lord i began to read i said oh god i've never really been buried in you lord i've never really had that experience you know i've been baptized in water and i thought it was a great thing back then it was you know and i believe if i went on back then like i believe like broadband told that brother that time he's worried about his daddy got a pole and hadn't been baptized you know but brother brown said listen don't you worry about it he'll be there bless him because he knew that down the road that that man would have if he'd lived i'm no of those saints if they have been here tonight if they have been living right here and hearing this good teaching of the word of god that you and i've got god give us that i believe that i said amen to the word praise the lord amen i believe better tuck it because they some of them wanted to really serve god some of them their whole heart was to to be in the will of god you know and live the life of the lord jesus christ them never will forget i sit in there at the table and that big old snow i didn't know brother ned ivis and brother glenn doyle and i'm at that time we're sitting there and reading and praying and somebody gave me the tape of brother brown i mean that really quickened to me and i said lord i need to call somebody i need to find out if there's anybody can baptize us to name the lord jesus christ boy i called up somebody told me about this little fellow said he come out of the church of god and they turned him out and said that he's got a little church back here somewhere in this house and said i know he believes like that you know and i will forget that and him and brother that i was having a service during this house so i called him in that snow i said surely ain't nobody crazy enough to they think we are crazy now you don't call them in this time of get cold and the snow about ain't ain't you still on the ground and i called him up he said brother you ready to go you know i guess i was kind of hoping he'd say wait in the sunshine but he said yes brother said right now he said that prophet said when you see these things you know you better get there as fast as you can so boy i know that i saw it hey man i couldn't sit still i wasn't i'd lost my alpha type for everything else and i had to get in this praise god i told my wife i said honey you ready to go of course she didn't know what to think about this because she hadn't really been quicker to her yet but yet she said well listen said if it says that and we see this we better go man they got us somewhere old brotherhood iverson brother doyle took us a way back there somewhere in the south line of the pond we i tell you we got everybody's attention everybody was coming down the road stopped and got out of their cars they thought was sure crazy now getting down in that water in that pond in the snow but brother i'll tell you what after god i believe that with some of that eyesight amen come on amen hallelujah when i never will forget when we got down in that water that day and they had burned us in the precious name the lord jesus christ you know i went back and started reading my bible and everything's a little bit different amen praise god these things begin to open up the door begin to open praise the lord and god let me walk in you know just walk right in that door and he began to come in tell me praise god and sup women take his up in my life amen brother then it wasn't hard to walk and it wasn't hard to listen come from it on you know i've been hearing him ever since then thank god hallelujah uh just like a on down and a little further along you get the reading things and little mysteries begin to come forth in the word of god and you learn more about him don't you you know even jesus itself learn don't be his dick praise god and i'll tell you what if he had to we got to learn today god's got to learn the spanx we got to let these things get down inside of us and begin to live you know let it begin to take a hold in us hallelujah amen didn't you begin to see yourself acting like he acted amy that's what was so strange to me when i got to seeing the scriptures opened up hear the voice of god begin to talk to me begin to show me things i begin to turn my old bible back through the pages and i see them things god just seemed like he's walking right out of it right in my soul amen amen brother the bible said the word killer but the spirit gives you life hallelujah and i uh boy what really got me one time when i found out that he said the helmet and earth will pass away but my word will always be here right i said man we need to quit trying to get to heaven no he said david's gonna pass away i said what are we gonna do now you know i was kind of confused about that brother hallelujah i said now if heavens and earth's gonna pass away where else could we go to i found out that he wants us to get in his word don't amen man let this word get settled in her spirit in her heart because that's him that's right i tell you what i i have a little my little family sometimes i have to i get rough with them i know i about believe in the word of god you know sometimes we get sick you know and we forget to i don't want the word a bit not a fact to me and you know sometimes if we ain't careful this whole thing will get to a place we've heard it so much and handle it so much you know and and heard somebody explain it and tell us about it that sometimes it just gets to be a form foreign amen more than a life you know right you know i see people today i i it hurts me sometimes when we go a lot of the used to go to a lot of the meetings where they had the big crowds of people in the message you know but i'd listen to the ministers and a lot of times they got to where they got off on little issues or something would argue about the word of god and you know kind of pull something maybe on somebody or get somebody to agree with what they're saying i said that just don't sound too good you know and i got to place to where i kind of losing my appetite to go to some of the conventions the last things i see in but you know i said how could if a devil can candy's gonna separate every little body of christ he's gonna he's gonna cause little things to happen and kill the fellowship out and kill out the love that we need for god you know but i'll tell you what if we ever get in love with him you'll love everybody amen praise god you just can't hit i've been loving this brother here now ever since i met my way back out of when i god opened up my eyes and got me to going the right way and brother dale and them i just got in my soul i can't help from loving them brother hey man we might not all be the getter but they somedays there's a bounding in there there's a love in there amen just bonding us together you know thank god it's real hallelujah it's something that's keeping us and it's making us look over sometimes we might not all wear the same kind of clothes or maybe drive the same kind of car and some might not live in the same kind of house but we gotta love our praise god that all of it belongs to one another amen i used to i think but boy you know i found out where the bible said not to covet you know you see some of the brothers seem like they're just blessed better than he was and you know you just thought it's awfully easy to cover that amen i found out boy i just need to get probably a little closer to him amen and i i found out that you know if you get the covenants and fangs and god certainly want us to do that because like a brother told me down here tonight he said you know i've never seen one of god's children beg for breakfast something wrong with them if they do anything because god's gonna look after his own ain't right i know we all get down sometime we didn't got our things maybe that we need and i guess god's got a purpose for that maybe we didn't go through some hard times we won't know how to help other people to go through it but always sometimes i know maybe we don't get have good jobs like when could need or somebody blessed us we got it blessed but we want to be thankful for every little thing with god praise god because there ain't going to be no little use and big eyes in god listen you might not think that you got as much of this but you just as real as they are amen praise god hallelujah if god's called us and placed us in the kingdom of god and we're part of him brother and sister you're going to be just as great as anybody praise god i've learned that i wanted to be more of a servant than you know than anything right you know what a lot of times we we don't realize that being a servant is about the best thing we could be right you know every a lot of people wants to be the one that's you know that maybe it's the head but listen i just love to be a servant if i could you know praise god just to help somebody you know if i could just help the least of god's children help them to see the word of god help them to understand more about the lord jesus christ and more about the faith of god it does me more good than anything that's better than having riches or anything to give me praise god and whatever god wants you to have i'll guarantee you'll have it praise the lord brother ain't going to give you something you don't need on it he's going to give you just exactly what you need he knows some of us is not able maybe to to handle things like others somebody a lot of people they know how to handle things you know gordon others do i guess if i had just everything i just give it out and you don't want to have nothing left praise god because i've always felt like brother branham you know he didn't much much in this world i mean he they tried to build him big houses want to put him in a place where his having a guard at the gates and things he said how could i want something like that that's right i don't that desire or nothing like that he said i don't have to have a place to where the children of god when they need prayer for sickness and need something from god they have to go through some kind of a guard or some kind of a thing to get to me he said i don't want that but he could have done that couldn't i mean that people would give him anything they offered to give him a million dollars and give him a new car maybe every year some kind of a big cadillac or something right in or he said how could i want something like that he said how would i feel when i go down the road and see the little old precious mother that's been over an old wash tub on a washboard or scrubbing he said how would i feel have a urchin some kind of a fella to drive me around this big cadillac and you know i was in some meetings one time on the saviors and i heard this preacher they got the preaching prosperity and they take up offense and wash tubs i mean i saw him fill up a wash tub full of philharmonic blessing and you don't got to preach it if you'd give to god and pull people and give everything they had you know just put all the hat in thinking that this was god you know then that preacher get up and you say i won't let my mother even let my dogs live in y'all's house i thought oh god how could people make a statement like that brother who would want something like that anybody that could even see it all or know that that wouldn't be god but people was deceived with things like that you know they was hindered and a lot of poor people they're not even serving god today because of things that was brought out to them like that a lot of them turned back you know a lot of them turned away from the leadership that they did have and never did get back right with god i know a lot of them that done it because they just felt like oh god if you don't care more about me than that then lord i don't need the certainty but see that ain't god god cures for you praise the lord and i tell you what i know you'll prosper god said if you would serve me and you don't believe in when you do that he said thou would above all things you prosper and be in hell praise the lord i believe god will do that part of you anyway i believe he'll give you help and i believe he'll prosper you and i mean he's gonna give you all the world's richest in here because he knows that you don't need him doesn't it i mean you just don't need but just watch him get violent man get unpacked from this world you know if he loved the world and the things of the world he said the love of god is not even in you i'm not packing up to get up there i'm gonna get unpacked that i can't go there praise the lord because these things is weights to us amen all this little stuff i tell you you have to pay taxes only if you have a thousand acres you're gonna have to pay taxes on you got a big home maybe a mansion or something you're gonna have to pay taxes on so there ain't no way around there darty you're gonna have to this thing's gonna hold on you i mean the devil he can cause you to prosper too if you didn't like he tried to get jesus to fall for that didn't he right he tried his best to get him to use a little bit his power you know to just perform a few miracles and he done that on preachers and boy they failed for it that's true i mean over the country if you just go back and get them in your mind you see where many of them fell for that it didn't take much showing them boy they just went right into it didn't it i mean they learned that you could have these riches and get it you know rob god's people and take from them you know and and well maybe not all together god's people because god's people don't get wise enough to not fall for that stuff after all amen it might take a little bit more this i say but we'll listen he'll finally he'll get her understanding open on it praise god god when you give to god and stand behind the word of god and and use it like god tells you to you'll be blessed amen brother god's gonna bless you everywhere you go hallelujah i was a preacher the other night on the where jesus well under sunday morning i believe it was week before last about jesus when that blind man was sorry you know when jesus spit up on the ground and took some of that old uh clay and mixed it up with that spit a little bit put it on his eyes you know what he told him said you just go down that pool way then i see it you know and just wash your eyes and you'll be all right it don't take much to get a miracle if you want one does it right just believe him praise god just take what he says and you know i've been i thought i was bringing it out tomorrow and i said listen when you need something from god if you'll be willing to take what it gives you i mean it might not be the best thing that you think that you'd like to have but when god gives you something take it praise the lord believe it amen i'll tell you sometimes it might be a rebuking or something but if you'll take that god will do something for you hallelujah it's hard to take rebuking sometimes hey i mean it's hard to get corrected sometimes it's always been hard for me back when i was little it was hard to get corrected you know but i thought that was a horrible thing to have to get corrected but sometimes you know we because we may be not seeing things or not growing like we should or getting in a position we need to be in sometimes god corrects us don't us and he'll he'll give us a little whip and you know he'll let us see that where are we at you know praise the lord if it wasn't for that we wouldn't know where we that but god sometimes has to do that praise the lord because i was thinking about the the little eagles how did they cut some used to their nest you know that good furry nest and softness in it how nice it was to jump the good soft nest and boy wasn't my mother's eagle and father eagle they know what to do dude that's right man they got tournaments just jumping in there and when they get out and do his work you know so what they do they just pulled the fur out and let him jump on the thorns a few times oh i'll tell you what that got his attention that's the way god has to do sometimes his little body you know he has to pull that fur out you know praise the lord i tell you what my it's like my girls some of my will get to preaching so hard against sin and you know the whirly boys and things that sat here in the world and now that's uh just stop living right you know we just get to preaching so hard against it sometimes and they wonder if they're going to ever get married you know some of them got up to about 30 years old and still haven't gotten married yet but you know what i believe we want to wait till the right one comes along amen i believe we need to wait praise god i'll tell you god's got that little part of the other part for you if you don't get him here you'll have him over there if you don't get her here she'll be over there for you god's got one for every person you know he's got plenty enough to go around some of them today satisfied with one they just get four or five you know but listen brother and sister i believe we were to build oneness don't you thank god i always believed in oneness amen and i believe it's yeah i believe that god's just gonna let us have one hallelujah i i know sometimes if we ain't careful we'll get the devil and get us different ideals and get things happening and this stuff we're leaving in a time when all this stuff is coming right up to the in here because we'll manifest manifesting time it's time for everything and all this stuff that we're going through now we're going through pressures in the world and all of us are piling up right here at the end time talking to a little brother down there yesterday i believe it was no preacher he said brother i've been trying to preach here for the last six months or something like that he said i've been seeing what's happening right here at the end time amongst the bride you know how these things are getting uh to us you know and we don't even see what's happening we don't understand that god is trying to get us redeemed you know instead of that we're getting bound down with things i didn't understand what he was talking about right and then but i know that they different doctrines and things are going on empty i mean all kinds of things are happening it ain't god it's you know the devil gets the offer of confusion amongst the people sometimes and he'll cause us to get uh ideal or about something that the prophet may be mentioned or or something other that he didn't you know he didn't say it's the same the lord and thanks and you know different subjects and we try to build something around it you know if we ain't careful we'll build a big old fence or a barn and we'll pull a lot of people into it but if it takes away the love and fellowship from our brothers and fans we better leave it along i don't believe that god wants nobody to build a barn and get our big fence and put a city you know and that's what happened to the nomination i looked under that i i listened sometimes i just had the radio list this little station over here in south carolina has some good singing and i mean every preacher comes on and got a different name a different denominational name i thought oh my he tell us something i never thought i'd seen that amongst the baptist people yeah i mean the pentecost as you expect anything but dad i never could because there's always more solids you seem like about what they're seeing what they belong to but you know what they had i bet you on that one station and during the day you'd hear probably a different hundred ministers that comes on there and everyone's got a different name for their churches i thought oh my you know what think about all these things that's happening and it's about like that about monk sobriety i mean amongst the message people because it's got different little ideas and different opinions you know different things of saying well this is the way it is and that kind of got me heard about some of the meetings we used to have the big meetings and i for a while i backed off and i just plumb quit going to any of the beats convention meetings i just and some of the fellowship not the fellowship but the minister's meetings because of little subjects coming up and i didn't see i mean i know we need to know what we're doing god don't want no ignorant people if you're eating it he'll get us give us some wisdom on it amen and i i feel needed that myself but you know just different things that comes up and and like like oh brother homer said is that the church here a few weeks ago he said brother he said i don't want nobody sheep but mine so if you think i'll come here to steal your sheep he said you got the wrong idea he said i can't pastor nobody's but mine amen i thought now boy that's good and praise god hallelujah but you know it ain't like that this we had one or two leave our church here lately one space sleeping with us a good fall but he i guess he might have told the truth he said i have a little brother he said brother collins just ain't preaching deep in that fart i thought i was preaching everything i know you know and uh he said these think hearted deep enough and i said well oh my made me kind of feel ashamed of myself i said lord please get me where i need to be god let me rise up to that place that i need to be but one person i can get in let me get that in you know if it's my wife you know i sure want to be able to get her in and i said lord if i can't feed nobody with her and just god if you've called me to be a minister and call me to to be a pastor lord please let me get to the place that i need to be right you know what nasa but i pray all the time i say oh god i said i might not be able to explain things like other people might not be able to get my message together like them but i i got to i got to where i get these little books out you know and i'd use them yeah man i'll tell you i don't believe you want something to clack dust do you that's right i get them out of hammer service i get them and i'll when i preach it i've got to find something you know as i read the little taxi cup then i i get my bible here and i kind of bring it out the word of god then a lot of times if i i'll read what he says about it because that's what we need to hear i'll tell you when elijah god raised him up here to get us in to bring a message to us we better listen to what he says right brother i'll tell you it better be a i know brother brown make my absolute you know far as a man but i tell you what he's showing me to absolutely amen amen he had him inside it that's right and that's he always pointed us back you know one time he's making a statement he said where could i send you to today he said could i point you to the brown tablet he said no he said that thing just as that is arrested he said where could i point you to he said i can't torture that he said but there's one place i can he said this to the lord jesus christ back to this word hallelujah you know if we can get somebody back in the word of god and get them to see what they are and let them see that god still alive is still real amen brother that's all that's going to matter and he'll help you if you read them little messages and and listen to them i'll tell you what i when you catch a hold of it and see that god was speaking you know it's not just a man it wasn't just brother brown but it was god speaking fruit hallelujah and that got me more that really struck me hard kind of like he did old peter and he said satan get behind me because there's a time i wouldn't have followed it like i need to there's a time i wouldn't have applied it to me like i went to the message you know and things like little things in here i'd say well maybe it just ain't as serious as he says it you know but it is i'll tell you right now you don't find many flaws in that prophet's message you don't find too many things in there that ain't really got god in it you know i mean there might be a few things was god was bringing him up and showing him about the seals and about the horse riders and things you know that god had to show him you know had to really bring the light to him and show him the truths of it when he was trying to get it from other men you know he's trying to get to revelation from other great men but god let him know that it was going to take him to bring it forth hallelujah it's going to take god to do it and that's the way it's going to take today if without god you know we'll we might just get into anything you can take one day's little message and build your church thank god you take a little message here and just build you up a big church out of it and call yourself this or then but without the holy spirit without god of being there you know we'll get in the mess won't we right that's right god is trying to get our minds back to his word back to him praise the lord you know there's a time i followed him in like a shatter like peter did i'd get off and i really wasn't identified with a message like i ought to be but i was walking in the shadow of it brother i mean i was standing out there to shatter but when i seen it it's going to take a crucifixion to me and when i seen what was going to really happen boy i had to really get birthed again hey man oh peter walked around and shattered him a long time didn't right but when he seen how he was delivered up to be crucified then peter began to kind of say well man i you know he's a good man but i just can't be crucified with i just can't let this man if they're gonna crucify him they'll do it to me too you know what he'll sure get you crucified want it when you get really in the message you'll be crucified right brother you're gonna have to lose your life here to bring to have it in him praise god as long as their own life's a living god that can't get in here and live come on it's going to take us a dime for him to live praise the lord i tell you what when i saw that and began to get in here and search it there and that's what was god was showing me the other night through that eyesight i said oh my i said god that's done got down in my soul praise god it opened up my eyes of understanding it's opened up my whole life that i can see you now and i know where you are praise god but i'm going to find him i'll get in his words here i used to get out in the woods and pray and fast and it was good but i was trying to find him somewhere else i thought he was a way under somewhere another and i was kind of calling down you know and i guess he was but he was down here in me and he's just riding along with me now and i just i just didn't know it right i was trying to run this little ship by myself come on brother brother i'll tell you what i come disciples after they saw the miracles they saw the great revival they saw all this and when they started over on the other side and they got down there and they began to uh storm begin to rage you know and things begin to happen they done done all they could themselves to get those ship this kind of stay stable a little bit finally one of them said we better wake us wake him up pay me better go down here and wake him up man he's we're gonna have to do something you know that's what i had to do brother praise god he's in here riding with me but i had to wake him up man you know that's what he's doing today if we'll ever wake him up he'll he'll calm the waves man he'll take care of every problem he'll take care of every need praise god but we gotta wake him up you know i'm afraid today a lot of times he's going to sleep on us you know he's letting us do everything you know have you ever tried to do your own thing sometimes and i mean you try to have your service you got to have a church you got to have your own religion you try to do everything you can god let's let us do it but if we don't get in his perfect will everything's going to be out of place i believe he's got a perfect wheel for the little bride to get into i believe he's got a perfect will for us to fall into and be led by the spirit of god amen man i know sometimes it might be a battle to us and you know the greatest battle the prophet of god said ever fought was your mind i guess you sold it i mean it's so mind he likes to remember things you know he likes to keep things and way back and fangs he hard to turn loose from you know but the soul wants to obey god hallelujah there's something down in here there's a little place down inside your heart and that in there there's a god that lives in there there's something there that's controlling us brother sister i tell you what you it's amazing how they got these little computers these little things you can just touch in a number now and find somebody and go to where that you know there's a man come to their house today uh insurance salesman he punched my address in that little thing and it took him on the wrong end of the road i chose ain't at first all the time you know he's way back in the woods way back there i said listen you know what i'm fine saying think many things accurate but god's word aren't it you know it's going to take this word to get us through that praise the lord amen i mean we can punch in something we get it all down through the ages people are punched in this and punched in that you know sometimes they get off on the road don't they but god always brings us right back to the road amen right back to the main road amen if we never let the holy spirit just don't awaken inside of us you know make sure that he's living there make sure that we know that god is taking us and leading us and lives inside of us hallelujah and i get onto my children other day my grandson got real sick you know and and i know i hurt my daughter i guess and my son-in-law's feelings a little bit i said lord i say you know we should have had him in prayer we should have brought him up for prayer i said when he got sick and had a fever and stayed like that for a day or two and real sick i said i'll come and sit in the church you know and i'll preach my little my heart out sometimes just trying to get people see that god's real you know i said all you had to do is just bring him up and let us pray for him we'll use this little oil here and just put a little on him and just lay her hands on him i said god can do something for him right it's kind of it's too simple for people sometimes either i mean the first thing we find when we get kind of sick is man we got insurance let's run down yonder to the doctor's office you know what's that first comes through her mind and i know we'll get healed if we get healed we're gonna get healed by god anyway but you know it's just easy sometime to believe his word eh brother brown said if i pray for everybody jeffersonville and all of you die said it ain't going to change god from being a healer you know she gonna still be that healer but you know what god is still obligated to his word right he won't never let his word fail he'll stay with his word and i told him i said and finally they did bring him up for i believe that morning the next day or so they got to thinking about that and they brought him up there for prayer we prayed for the little fellow you know i believe god completely healed him he took that sickness out of his body you know god will do what he says he'll do more he said by his crops we're already healed but he has to get us to a place you know where we can believe it praise god i mean god so proved itself to me in so many ways amen to show me that he loved me and showed me that he cured for me and he's there with me you know he's on the inside he's living there but a lot of times i i'll let him go to sleep on me you know i just i forget to uh get his benefits like he said all these all everything in here is farming praise god all of his great benefits and all of his power and his glory is in here it belongs to me praise god because i'm a part of him brother right but we're going to have to learn how to use it you know taking use to don't let it become of no fact to us because if it does the devil can beat us out of just one little thing sometimes he'll just take one little he'll cause us to uh let one little thing happen i know he's done that to me you know what next thing it's easier it gets a little easier for me to give into it you say oh some things it's too hard for god you know i just can't trust him with some of my old problems you know listen god understands everything doesn't right he knows everything i tell you you're while back i had the interest in to bust in my stomach right down next to my spine right here right in there i mean artery right in there you know and i thought i was gone you know my wife and i started praying i didn't jump up and call everyone to call them families and things i said oh no god will take care of thanks they started praying for me i thought i was gone i tell you when the blood leads you that's where the life you'll be thank you you don't last long will you but i'll tell you we got to pray and i everything was dark i just know that i was going it's been about four years ago and and i'd come to myself funny and there's a praying for me sitting on the bed and but you know god restored me back kept me they did got me to go out to the doctor but i put god first they got me to go out there at that doctor and old doctor will check me said listen you would be dead i said how in the world you're living i said well god just ain't ready to leave here right now he said well let me call the ambulance said need to i'll call the emergency room i said no i said i'll we'll go down if we need to go you know i i didn't have to go but i did go down there my wife said you're to go and just let them see what happened you know got down to that old doctor when i got in the emergency room they started sticking all these things in and needles and putting blood in me all i need is just a good mess of liver or something might have been all right man i went and had to take out my shots and things and all that stuff putting auction back my veins and if i just got a good fried piece of liver or something you know to build my blood up a little bit out of bed all right but you know i i went there away and hit connie i suffered during that old intensive cure for two three days you know people are praying for me but i just felt good you know i mean i god had already done something for me he let me know he's with me down there praise the lord he went with me to the emergency room he was there with me but i had to this whole body here you know it's gotta i guess go through some of those things but god was showing me that he loved me praise the lord and i hope i just get this over to you tonight because god is he loves you so much amen he'll take care of everything morning my whole heart gets to act it up sometimes and no devil he'll he'll use things don't he does that to hinder us you know because he's going to be a hindrance he's taken out of the way and you sometimes just say boy i better go it's hard to hear this you get to thinking maybe your cancer is on the inside of you you know the best thing that you ever had is just faith amen praise god faith will take you through it all amen through all sickness and diseases or whatever it is there's a god there that'll take you right from every bit of it he'll leave you won't leave nothing out of it amen he'll here's joey that he loves you praise the lord so don't let him defeat you in any way i know if uh if he could get us out and make us think well god's forgot us and left us in sickness and diseases i've heard a lot of people say well i've tried to trust god and everything you know and when i get sick seem like it's no he's not there but he is there god is will you ever where are you at and whatever you're in he's there we praise god i believe as my brother told me before service said about helping somebody uh giving somebody some money or something said whatever you do with you know god's gonna if you take that money and use it misuse it it'll be you're doing it but you know because i give it to him it's god you know and to think about that you know if you if you misuse god you have to you do something wrong or get out of the will of god you know you god's there you're doing him you're taking him weed if you're a child of god right you know we shouldn't be good we shouldn't take advantage of his fang and say god i don't want to do nothing lord that you wouldn't do god don't let me do nothing of my own you know don't let me get in my own will because if we do we'll find ourselves in a kind of a bad shape sometimes we'll give you a get rebuked sometimes and you say sometimes old pastor who get up and he'll you think well boy he's he's just picking on me you know he knows too much about me but you know god lets him know it sometimes amen in the spirit that little pastor if he's ordained of god he's obligated to just uncover every little thing amen he's on he's obligated to bring our attention back to god ain't he back to the fangs of god i mean if he just let us go and just say oh you just do what you want to do and you know just get out just have a good time and i tell you brother and sister we'll forget about god sometimes you know what we'll catch ourselves on that ship and i was thinking about this other night i said oh peter when the lord jesus when he come back storm that time and it's after that ship and old peter they got to look and disciples got to looking around they saw something walking on the water i said man this is a you know a lot of people don't believe in ghosts i don't guess but they said this is a ghost in here and old peter got to a place he finally got enough boneless in him he said well master if this is you just let me just let me come out there and you know god will let you walk on the water right but you better have faith when you step out of that shield i believe that's what god's been trying to get us to do is that we've rode this old ship you know and it's about time for us to step out on the water i mean we've gotten used to riding the ship too much you know we're living in a time when a storm is a raging brothers sister we live in a time when we're living in a darkest page we've ever lived in really right now in this united states of america right when the little brides are getting ready to get in that millennium i was reading another day where brother brown i said wait back in 61 i believe what he said we should have already been in the living i said oh my have we missed it i said think about that he said you already would have been in it i said sure to god we ain't behind that far you know he was looking for it back then i'm preaching it you know trying to get people a seat it's not long off it's just getting real close but you know we're getting we're getting right close to this thing and we're coming up with a most than an hour you better believe that the devil knows about these things he knows that we're fixing to just walk in that other dimension with him praise god and or we something we're trying to get us you know work on us and our vines and our spirit and get us to a place that will you know just can't really step out on him like we need to but god is gonna we're gonna have to do it you know it's like he told peter he said peter just come on out and meet me just step out but as you know when he stepped out hey what did he do he started going down didn't he you know what that's what we got to see here because if we're not really careful we're living in a time that gods are telling us to step out into the deep you know to get in him get our minds anchored in him get herself in but if we ain't really got our minds anchored in there then there'll be all kinds of little things that devlin used to how to get us off on something else you know you get us to get the different ideals and different opinions and i didn't know there was so many got in the message to here a few about a year or two ago and got the list of different things i never seen lots of things come up my life i said oh my what's going on here you know what i thought we just need to get in this basically to simply believe what he said you know and staying with what the prophet of god said i mean keep that love and keep that in unity you know but i know there's little things in here i guess people's mist i guess a lot of the great preachers we got today in the message is probably maybe has i know maybe some of them knows it all but still there may be a few little things in here that they don't know you know i haven't got been revealed to them right yet but we're searching you know we're digging we're waiting for god to give us the final a test thing we praise the lord probably we're coming to the final test brother and sister that's why the prophet of god said i ain't gonna be many make it he said why because we we're coming through the trials of these things and tested i mean it's just like the natural types of spiritual and like my daughter back here i she's been going to nurses you know to be a nurse and all the spends hours and days and nights are kind of understanding the books and things she has to go through you know but when she comes to that final test of it and she don't it don't she ain't got to what it takes to pass it she's gonna she just can't go in you know that's the way god's doing us he's putting us through the final test of this message i believe i believe we've come a long ways but i still believe we've got a little ways to go yet ain't we praise god hallelujah so we might be able to walk on the water but if we ain't really careful we'll start sinking you know brother it's a serious thing this this is desperation that god you know prophet of god said we weren't going to make it till desperation said it you say well how can we get desperate listen i believe it's time to get desperate don't you i believe it's time to search a scripture search a word search a message thank god get back and see if there's any little hens left off anywhere see if there's any things that's hindered us anything that stops us from really believing what he said because they gonna take much to to get us to thinking off on different lines and different ideals and things and i i tell you what i love my precious brothers i got a lot of them that i know and you know i know that they kind of leaning off the different little ideals and things and i just wonder i say lord is this really the way we need to go is this what we need to believe you know i if you get to listen to some of them that's why i guess we need to stay with their pastor though thanks god you know brother brown said your pastor will take you through it man if you put confidence in him i believe y'all got to greet when it's pure praise i believe you got one that wants to make it amen brother dale i've listened to him and i told him the other day i said brother when i if i go up there you got to promise me you're going to come down there and be with us an attitude praise the lord he said i'll sure do it brother he said i'll promise y'all come down and i told him i was gonna really call him when he gets back and get him set up because i need we need that teaching praise god my little body needs more understanding that we all need i know i need it and i know our little church needs it thank god and i believe god can give us a little hearing a little there he'll help us to mature and we'll be more get more like god we begin to look like him amen live like him and be like him praise the lord and he's working on us amen my little boy joshua used to sing that song he's still working on me you know what the whole song is all about don't know what he knows but he's singing about every service and you know what i thought boy that sounds good amen god was working on me hallelujah and he didn't quit working on me he still mowed me up we gotta get that old father's house i tell you when we get to it brother and get uh god's got to beat on us and you know and bring us through a real testing time to get us molded in him don't right hallelujah you got to be just like him and i was telling it or not i said when it was michelangelo he made that statue of moses praise god and he spent a lot of time working on that thing did i mean he had to get such a revelation such a mind did him to build that thing he got so perfect you know he finally got in such a condition he's finally struck and said speak did he thought that hang on to talk you know what's words got to get some means so much to us it's got to get to a place that we can hear god talking amen amen the word killeth but this spirit will give life you know there's a god that hears us when we get to uh getting our hearts down to this word getting our lives applied to it getting your whole being applied to it you can hear him talking to you you think god still can't talk to us he can do it okay right sometimes he has to use old pastors and he's a sunday school teacher i'd have to use a deacon or something but i'll tell you what he's still talking to us amen thank god he'll come right to us and you say lord that's what i needed you know it's hard sometimes to get scalded to scold it a little bit but i tell you what when you do and you can overcome and take it he'll do you good praise god that's right i mean it helps you something to get some time just get rebuked amen and if you old pastor sometimes he gets something he'll you know just begin to preach fangs and it he'll say well hey i don't need that i don't think but if you get the search in your mind real good your soul you might need it i mean it might be something that you need and he's trying to god it's trying to use that old pastor he wonder why he's not preaching something like that he wonders why he's a set in his face but some how another day somebody maybe needs it all of us might not need it but there might be one that does need just like you sometimes you preach a little message you see people that needs healing and needs they need something from god maybe need the holy ghost or need of lessons from god or they need to have more understanding and you try to preach the things that god would put on your heart to that need you see and god sees that need he needs he might be the least one in the church it might be somebody that's not mature to or somebody that's not really been birthed yet or something but god will let's the preacher he led to ministry they'll begin to preach these things till god gets us right to it morning then you'll know it's him talking to you praise the lord that's the way it does to me and i it's like i what i said with i'm precious brothers that was in a message it was with brother branham and listen to him brother uh parmer i guess a lot of you know him that's what brother brown brother jack farmer he come and spent a whole weekend one time we fished and count and boy they sat around the little count for us and he knowed i didn't know much about nothing you know i was i was playing things in the message and he'd tell me all these things that god had showed him and brought him through and it opened up his understanding to you know it's just a blessing to him i mean i enjoyed it so much i've been with him a whole week and hearing him expound on some things and that god talked to him and brought him through you know and it really was a help to me did i run into that brother ned iverson boy he he was a real bible scholar and i thought man this fellow here he just got too much knowledge i said with this little jewish brother come through one time and and i i know brother brother eddie's done gone to be the lord so i can't i can't hurt him more now you know you can't do him much damage now uh but i'll tell you what just a little brother coming up this little jewish brother he said brother dad iverson he said what you need to do is just cut your head off and throw it in that garbage can oh i thought boy that's something you know i said i didn't understand what he was talking about he said brother collins he got me off this little jewish place that brother that man's just got too much knowledge he said he just got too much knowledge i guess that little brother need to do some growing too you know amen i thought about it i said oh my i'd love to know what that brother ned knows because he really knows about the message you know he could take you from one book to nothing and quote hearing protern just line you right up you know he just about know how you live i said how can you do that but you know that's the way god does he's a getting us in a statue or something maybe god's placeness is that little lively stones you know one up on one and just getting his little temple made and i thought boy if i'm one of them stones i need to get my place you know thank god i i need to be placed and that's what god was doing he's a placeless in that part of the body you know wherever we're at just like you can't say to your little toe you don't need it do you i mean your whole body's got to be working together and i it's just like if you see somebody that's struggling somebody maybe don't know as much as something maybe he's not obligated to carry all that load you know somebody's got to get a little higher to help a safety right i mean if somebody don't learn how to use something and work with it then we'll all i certainly don't want to be eating it to you concerning the leadership of god i want to find it and see what the prophet of god has said to me to walk in that way and living that way talking that way you know i got ashamed to talk about people i used to be pretty bad to criticize people but i hear the old brothers say one time talking about the uh how it sounds and took that jawbone that i asked and killed all them philistines and people and i thought man then he come out and said he said you know what he said we killed more than he does he said us it's just individuals kills more than sampson i said oh my what's he saying yeah he said these jaw bones here kills more people than sex i said oh my god i'm gonna quit talking about people lord i sure ain't gonna be guilty back tomorrow i try to quit that you know because it's that thing if you catch yourself sometimes and we'll you know you kill people by just talking about something right man you don't have to shoot them or knock them ahead or beat them to death but just simply talking about them you can kill your brothers and sisters so that learned me a little bit on that brother i got a little wisdom on that i said oh god i ain't gonna be guilty of that no more if i can happen somebody starts talking about somebody now i try to walk away or just close myself up no because i want to stop i ain't going to kill anymore probably killed a lot of them but i've stopped but here this little scripture meant so much to me i said oh god i said the other night when i was a prayer and reading this and i said lord there's something in here that i need about that eyesight i said god if i can just anoint my eyes with it lord the only way you can do it really to what your eyes will just to hear what that prophet is saying i mean if you want to get some this eyesight on listen to what he says believe it and i'll tell you what he'll drop down through your whole body he'll make you dress right it'll make you wear your hair right it'll make you tall proud it'll make you live right it'll make you do what you're supposed to and that's what god's trying to get us in a position to do it to be obedient to him man amen if god can ever get us in line with him uh but i was going back through this and my spirit tonight god was taking me back to paul and to moses and a lot of these fellows and how that they had to be brought down to a place you know that they could they had to see god you know they had to know israel hallelujah i don't want to be out there if i don't know it's real just like a lot of the soldiers and army you know they get out there they don't go through that train and teaching and listening and being obedient to how to conduct ourselves and listen you know what they don't know what to do when they get involved and that's the way god's letting us we're fighting the greatest battle that's ever fall right now i mean we go we're living in this time when these flames are repeating again you know the prophet of god said all these things are repeat again we're living in the sodom condition like it was back in the days of sodom we live it when god is letting the promised son come forth amen he's he's letting it be manifested in our hearts but we're living in this very hour when these things are taking place i mean it's god's let it roll around you know to the time that we're living in and it will if we ever been a time listed or governor news you know it's you can't find much fitting to listen to they can but bad news on their every bit of use you listen to is about it bad except the good news and these things are getting around our nations is gone the leadership of our nation's gone what's the happening people's killing and murder and stealing in augusta georgie you just turn on the radio down there and it's just become horrible it's just to become a place of death in a night that passes what somebody's been killed they pass the road and shoot people standing on the streets not even without any cause it's to shoot people we're living in a time that people is going totally insane they're young people i oh i think we better get a young people for god's sake we better get our minds in the lord this get ourselves anchored in because uh it's time we're living in when this bangs are manifest and it's coming right on the scene and they only the young people it's the older people i mean they got to a place we just don't know what is the real leadership at and what we think well where is it at but god's in here he's inside there so you got the holy ghost in if you've got that presence of god in you brother and sister all you have to do is talk to i found out one way to get close to god that's to pray and read your bible i don't know what a way to tell you i mean you could pass yourself to death and still be lost without god amen unless you're getting yourself out of the way i found out that's what i need to do i used to fast to try to get god to come down on the scene to be in the service but i found out i was doing the wrong thing lord i need to fast to get myself out of the way god if i just get my old self killed and get this old gene collins get him plumb lost you know lord to let your mind and your spirit take control in this old vessel here god then i'll make it that's the only way i'll make it that's all the way i can help anybody because i was used to praying like a brother said you're sinners you know anybody can be healed i've seen people that wasn't even living right get healed by miracles i mean because it they they just believed you know they'd come out with what faith they had and god would heal them and a lot of them they just wouldn't make it fill them with a holy spirit and i've seen them receive that baptism the holy spirit on the human spirit you know and they'd prophesy and speak in tongues give out messages but they just couldn't live right they just couldn't get in the place they need to be with god especially my wife we come down into custody georgie going to church with some of her people and and it kind of astonished you know spain's deceiving sometimes if god don't open up your mind and show you things before we got into the message and i never will forget how to we'd go there and some of her people would shout just shallow the church you know fall out in the spirit people ever would all and i'd see them day by day and see how they just wasn't living right i mean if i came to see the things in the scriptures that they need to obey and do what god wanted them to do and line up with the word of god but they had the anointing on them you know and they had that spirit of working in their life but they couldn't they just couldn't walk in the light of christ couldn't live like they need to i said lord there's something you're lacking somewhere and they certainly was you know you couldn't but my wife thank god gotta got a hold of her and let her see that you know she had to live his words not go but feelings you go by what obedience to god you know your feelings might try to take you some other way i mean if you got your mind in here might be trying to take you a lot of ways but in your feelings but yet the word god let it be the truth you know he said let every man be alive with my word be the truth so if that one so if that would be the soul then we got our builder life up on his word they praise god it might not satisfy our feelings all the time might not satisfy once all time but i'd better be in his word praise god and have my own wants and have my own feelings because i'll tell you we've satisfied our feelings we might do everything we can to just get all we can get you know and be blessed out here in the natural manner and yet god's wanting to take us the way that we need to go some other way through the word you know and it might get a little hard you know why sometimes we have some hard times and good times but god brings us through all of it praise the lord but i want to get back to this year now i'm going to stop here god is trying to get her mind back to his word back to his presence amen and i found the best way to do it is to get this old-fashioned bible word and just say lord here i am god lord if you'll take me in moment use me and let me just be in your leadership god i'll i just like the prophet of god he started off as that young fellow i used to get that life story out and i read it listen to it i say oh man it's just a blessing to hear what he was going through but a lot of times he had to he god rebuked it and god chased him and you know a lot of his wants he didn't get him did i mean he had to take him and take him around the hard way sometime and he lived as poor he's the poorest person i guess it was in kentucky at one time he didn't have nothing you don't but after he got in the mind of god he didn't need want for nothing i mean everything that he needed you know it was our farm praise god and it was hard because he sure didn't want to burden the people for nothing he didn't want nobody to feel like that they need to be burdened for him even out of his as many right when he's out in on the fields and going and and he he didn't want to impress some people he said god if you call me you'll meet the need you know you'll see that this needs me it did and you know what he said i'll get a job if god i'll go back to work if you don't meet the needs i they want him to come overseas in different places and him a prayer and kind of get in the mind of god get in the leadership of god and you know he didn't have finances to go he just didn't have help to go so he'd start praying he said lord i'll just get me a job and go to work and if you want me to go when i get enough money then i might be able to go but see that wasn't god's plan was it god knows how he could get him in his will he didn't meet them needs did he'd make sure if he sent him he'd be there to meet the need for him praise the lord and he saw that and that prophet of god as he growed up and began to see these things how god was leading him and material and getting him ready for this journey praise the lord it become a blessing to him and he just got richer and richer on the inside of it praise god he said if i need a million dollars next week god will give it to me boy i'll tell you when you get that close to god and get to a place you know there's no doubt in you there's nothing can keep you from walking in faith and living in faith and staying in the faith of god then you've got to bless them in your life and i believe that's what he's trying to do teach individual praise the lord i believe he's picking us up a little bit at a time and we'll begin to see where he said you know and it's hard sometime to go through these trials and go through the testis and go through the pressures of them but sometimes god let you do that to see if you're gonna still love him don't you i mean if he just stayed on the ship all time and got everything you needed i mean it's everything learned every little things maybe we'd forget about god but forget about praying and forget about how others is having to go through struggles and things sometimes but we have to be touched with these things you know god he'd come as low as anybody could he humbled himself and come down here left his riches and glory left everything he had to come down here to walk in their footprints did he had to take this little journey parson he is tested by all these things and whatever trial and error persecution ever sin every disease god had to go through the test of his faith he overcome that that we could overcome so today if we realize that everything that we go through and every little test we go through god's already paid for it he's already given us sprint to overcome any praise the lord he's made us strong enough to overcome these things brother and sister will become real to us after fall amen and i i just thank god for his grace tonight do you love him amen i'm going to stop prayer but listen let me read that one little license verse and then i'll stop amen revelations 3 and 18 he said here in 21 he said to him that overcome will i grant to set with me and my throne even as i also overcame and i sat down with my father in his promise he to have a year let him hear what the spirit set up under the churches right you know god spoke to all them church ages didn't he and all down through them and he's speaking to us today hearing this lastingness this is closing out let us hear what the spirit is saying hey babe brother god is kind of getting his little body ready she's fixing to go on a journey and i'll tell you what like her brother was telling me that everybody said brother when we get where we need to be i believe that prophet now i'm anxious to get to come on the scene amen he asked me that i believe in the return ministry i said yes i believe in it i mean returning that's right prophet of god i believe it i believe he's going to return amen but you know what i don't think he needs to come and finish up a message i believe he left us give it to little bride i believe he's going to make a bride out of baby i believe she's going to be married to the lord jesus christ and that's their whole name she'll be mrs jesus amen god's a chronic he's doing that for us right now let us hear what the spirit is saying to the churches brother and sister god's been talking to us and bringing it to us and every time we hear the little pastor get up here his heart just burning in him and a little message that set him on this far in his house or out there while he's going down the road it'll tell him what this little pastor y'all's a little pastor how when it comes back you know sometimes god had to get the prophet off on little crips and things to get to give him something sometimes it's hard if you around a good bunch of people like y'all or brothers and sisters maybe to get what you really need you know you have to get out in the woods sometimes or off in a desert or way at you under a mountain somewhere for god to come and just open up a little nugget to you amen because somebody needs it don't they and i mean everybody might not need it but i know i'm still growing myself amen no i'm thank god for for my precious brothers i'd love to sit around and talk to you and listen to you because there's something there you've got this heavenly i mean this is like a brother here a song leader or if i had him around i'd sit around with him all the time tell me about these things he's just got wisdom and god god's done something for him and i it pays us to listen sometimes to brothers that god is showing things uncover just let them get it out of the message a little things done through their life that's bringing these little nuggets on the scene brother it's gonna help us to be over conversation do you love him with all your heart tonight is anybody here tonight and you don't really know him but all your life i tell you need to know amen put him in all
