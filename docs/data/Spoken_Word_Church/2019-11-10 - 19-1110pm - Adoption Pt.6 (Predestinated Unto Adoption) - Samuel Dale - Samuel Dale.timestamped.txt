[18:42] that part that we may feast in you we
[18:44] love you and we thank you we committed
[18:46] to you now in Jesus name
[18:51] visions one there you go thank you this
[19:00] is Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[19:02] the will of God to the Saints which are
[19:05] in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[19:08] Jesus grace be unto you and peace from
[19:11] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[19:13] Christ this it be the God and father of
[19:16] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[19:18] with all spiritual blessings we're at
[19:21] now in heavenly places in Christ what's
[19:25] the believers position heavenly places
[19:28] right according as he has chosen us in
[19:32] him
[19:33] now remember we didn't use him as he
[19:36] chose us in him before the foundation of
[19:40] the world that we should be holding
[19:42] without blame before him and love having
[19:45] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[19:48] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[19:49] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:52] will to the praise of the glory of His
[19:55] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[19:57] in the beloved in whom we have
[20:00] redemption through his blood the
[20:02] forgiveness of sins according to the
[20:05] riches of His grace wherein he hath
[20:08] abounded toward us in all all wisdom and
[20:11] prudence having made known unto us the
[20:15] mystery of his will now what's the
[20:16] mystery of his will to adopt us right
[20:19] that was the mystery from all the way
[20:21] now watching this we come down from
[20:23] Genesis according to his good pleasure
[20:26] which he hath purposed in himself that
[20:29] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[20:31] times he might gather together in one
[20:32] all things in Christ both which are in
[20:35] heaven and which are on earth even in
[20:38] him and him also we have obtained an
[20:41] inheritance being predestinated
[20:44] according to the purpose of him who
[20:46] worketh all things after the counsel of
[20:49] his own will that we should be to the
[20:52] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[20:55] Christ in whom ye also trusted watch not
[20:58] after that you heard the word of truth
[21:01] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[21:04] also after that ye believed you were
[21:07] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[21:10] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[21:12] until the redemption of the purchased
[21:14] possession unto the praise of his glory
[21:17] you may be seated the Lord had his
[21:19] blessing to the reading of his word now
[21:23] I've told you before you take Ephesians
[21:25] 1 you can preach anywhere in the Bible
[21:28] and bring your thought right out of
[21:31] Ephesians 1 and all the night you know
[21:34] maybe we'll get into that part of doing
[21:37] it but just remember that now and keep
[21:39] it to keep it in that that part to where
[21:45] that we can understand our background
[21:47] just
[21:47] still a little bit for this morning and
[21:49] then move into where we're at in the
[21:52] afternoon
[21:53] all right here so remember what we were
[21:56] talking about that there's three stages
[22:01] of adoption the new birth the Statue of
[22:07] a perfect man the growth development etc
[22:10] and then the adoption to wit the
[22:14] redemption of the body all right now
[22:17] what is the thing down through there
[22:19] that has been left on or had not come
[22:23] forth or the Prophet said headstone
[22:25] hadn't come back in the early ministry
[22:27] talking about that and we know that the
[22:29] cornerstone was a revelation of Jesus
[22:31] Christ built on the foundations of
[22:33] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being
[22:35] the chief Cornerstone alright then the
[22:38] headstone you know would be the opening
[22:42] of the entire word which would be the
[22:45] seals from revelation 6 because that's
[22:47] what Jesus preached in Matthew 24
[22:50] alright so then you have that all
[22:52] indirect to lay into order and that's
[22:55] what I was asking you are getting you to
[22:57] try to get you to think the Lord Jesus
[23:01] he didn't have to be adopted and now he
[23:03] went through these things as an example
[23:07] he didn't have to do these things he
[23:10] didn't have to do this that you know
[23:13] it's an example to even me so their own
[23:16] two old lead Jordan River the Lord Jesus
[23:20] started his ministry he received from
[23:24] Dyer the Commission to go forth and
[23:26] bring those things and an example are
[23:30] set forth as him as to being the child
[23:33] of God or son of God all right and and
[23:36] it's he said verse this is my beloved
[23:38] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell alright
[23:42] that's a wonderful position but do you
[23:44] realize that each born-again believer
[23:47] yeah see that's why so hard for me to
[23:49] background-color preach the whole
[23:50] message
[23:51] do you realize each born-again believer
[23:54] that God said I'm pleased to dwell no no
[24:00] no
[24:01] well he's not there then I mean it can I
[24:05] put it that away and it be understood
[24:07] correctly if he's in there he's pleased
[24:10] to dwell or he wouldn't be there he's
[24:13] not going to give you the new birth
[24:17] contrary to the word he's not going to
[24:21] give the new birth just because somebody
[24:22] says I've got the new birth that that
[24:24] doesn't mean a thing that's that's our
[24:26] problem that's her ideas you know that
[24:28] we get into in in life all right
[24:32] but see he said dark this is my beloved
[24:35] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all
[24:38] right he had three years of going
[24:43] through all right we'll read him in just
[24:46] a second to work that you'll have it
[24:48] because we had to cut short this morning
[24:49] and still run out but he had three years
[24:52] of the most horrible ministry as we've
[24:54] called it our life constantly trying to
[24:57] kill him trying to do everything about
[24:59] it you know doing everything they could
[25:02] to hinder him and then he goes to Mount
[25:07] of Transfiguration well see you're going
[25:11] through and following his life through
[25:12] you know there and seeing how that he's
[25:15] done this and he's done that and he's
[25:16] he's you know threatened don't ever hand
[25:19] and all kind of thing he's done
[25:21] everything you know trying their best to
[25:23] to trap him in this and trap him in his
[25:26] words and he goes to Transfiguration and
[25:30] God says now this is my beloved Son in
[25:34] whom I'm pleased to dwell well look what
[25:37] he does he adds to it says here you him
[25:41] in other words he says now he's not my
[25:44] quote brother branham he said that
[25:47] sometimes the father spoke sometimes
[25:50] Jesus spoke now if that's hard to
[25:52] understand remember the father's the
[25:54] Holy Ghost himself
[25:56] remember Jesus is the flesh to just give
[25:59] you a little example to line that up
[26:01] with it you know and then you're not
[26:03] what does that mean isn't it means it's
[26:05] what it was sometimes the father spike
[26:07] sometimes the human element of Christ
[26:09] our Jesus himself would speak you
[26:12] all right in doing that see then you
[26:15] come down through the Ministry of the
[26:17] Lord Jesus as I said and you see how it
[26:19] works out within when he come to Mount
[26:22] of Transfiguration and said here you him
[26:25] it looks like our thoughts you know what
[26:29] he's done this and he's done that he's
[26:31] done this and he's done that he's went
[26:32] through this horrible thing now it's
[26:34] going to be a great glorious thing no
[26:37] the most horrible time of the life of
[26:40] the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:41] was the life six months veteran said a
[26:45] very short ministry he said somewhere
[26:49] around he didn't see give us that number
[26:50] but it it would you know we're just
[26:52] saying through here and six over here if
[26:54] you take what make numbers what you want
[26:56] to in matter if it's two days it's two
[26:58] days still the point is they're the most
[27:01] horrible time and thoughts was there
[27:05] looks like it ought to be different it's
[27:08] not but a random he came into existence
[27:11] that brought the message started out
[27:13] back there had his River Jordan
[27:16] he had his time that God came down and
[27:21] witnessed and was saying this is my son
[27:25] your ministry will cover the world
[27:28] you'll go do this you'll lose and you'll
[27:30] fall run the second coming of Elijah all
[27:33] right a great announcement looks like
[27:36] the world would have flocked to it and
[27:38] and run it sold great now we have
[27:40] somebody to carry us on you know we've
[27:43] got the Holy Ghost we got looks like the
[27:45] Pentecostals at least would have caught
[27:47] that but instead what did they do they
[27:51] turned against him
[27:53] and he spent all of those years at least
[27:55] he says 33 years coming to the statue of
[27:58] a perfect man and there he was look like
[28:03] he'd get better but not it got worse
[28:04] they turned him down where he would
[28:07] start off preaching to five hundred
[28:09] thousand two hundred thousand or
[28:10] something then the first thing you know
[28:13] it would drop down to where it is just a
[28:17] few alright but he was in his schooling
[28:20] training stature a perfect man growth
[28:23] development
[28:24] until he went to Arizona and brought the
[28:27] Prophet said God take you out adoption
[28:30] God taking you out on the backside of
[28:32] the desert in other words taking you out
[28:34] to yourself he took him out back there
[28:37] and he gave him the seals did that make
[28:42] him did it turn the religious world
[28:46] upside down it should have because that
[28:48] was the Word of God that was the
[28:51] greatest thing nobody had ever spoke we
[28:53] all wondered what did this mean what did
[28:55] that mean is kind of like my
[28:57] brother-in-law's of Baptist preacher and
[28:59] he believed that that thing was you know
[29:02] there in the beginning was that animal
[29:04] he said it's like King Kong you know you
[29:06] just see it a great big ol animal
[29:08] walking across the earth you know I said
[29:11] and deceiving everybody I said that
[29:15] don't that don't look like he's going to
[29:17] see nobody will see that was his way
[29:21] mankind had no idea what those symbols
[29:24] and things were see why the code it
[29:27] would take a prophet to bring it all
[29:29] right he would come on the scene he'd
[29:31] enter his ministry would climb and climb
[29:32] I'll repeat this in a minute but he
[29:34] would climb and climb in his ministry
[29:36] and then the seals would open and the
[29:39] world turned even more against him they
[29:42] literally put him out one to see you he
[29:44] said this will drive what they say this
[29:46] will drive thousands of my friends away
[29:48] from me and it did it put him out of the
[29:52] religious realm as far as popularities
[29:55] and things oh yeah they wanted him
[29:57] because they wanted to fishes and loaves
[30:00] that went with it they wanted him to
[30:02] come because where he would would you
[30:04] know draw big crowds to their meetings
[30:08] and things yeah they wanted him there
[30:10] like he said when he was the Prophet was
[30:13] out when Jesus was raising the dead
[30:14] healing the sick they won't him
[30:16] was that quick as he said being to say I
[30:17] and my father is one and did not the
[30:20] Prophet say when you begin to say I and
[30:22] my father is one and these other things
[30:25] he said they'll turn against you
[30:27] alright see and it got worse instead of
[30:34] getting the better and really becoming
[30:36] popular he got worse until
[30:38] just turned out and rejected by mankind
[30:41] well I believe that don't you
[30:46] cuz I can follow that line you know well
[30:49] right now if I could follow that line
[30:50] with the Lord Jesus come out to work I
[30:54] believe that would follow the life and
[30:56] line of brother Branham within I believe
[30:58] somewhere in there we can find ourselves
[31:00] and that's what I'm trying to get us to
[31:02] do why talking about what's going on now
[31:06] talking about what's been going on since
[31:09] the Prophet left the saying I didn't die
[31:11] when the Prophet left me when it come on
[31:16] into the 70s and the things like that I
[31:18] began to rejoice I preached to you here
[31:23] in 74 that we could pass the Year 2026
[31:27] and not break the word I've always been
[31:30] upbeat going because it didn't get dis
[31:34] interesting to me it got very
[31:36] interesting to begin to see what was
[31:38] taking place and then we could see two
[31:40] hours following this happening you know
[31:43] all kind of things that that you can
[31:45] take right into the word but seeing them
[31:47] the day in the hour that we live for
[31:50] ourselves
[31:51] see then some words I'll end it up and
[31:53] then I'll try to run feist and then
[31:55] we'll pick her message see then we ended
[31:57] up by talking about one you received a
[32:00] new berth somewhere down through there
[32:02] maybe before you heard the prophet after
[32:04] you heard it that doesn't matter
[32:05] you receive the new birth and that new
[32:08] birth made you a child of God
[32:10] alright as I was trying to explain that
[32:13] the Jews were entitled to the adoption
[32:17] because it was their lineage and right
[32:20] but they rejected that and when they
[32:23] rejected it it turned to the Gentiles
[32:26] all right coming to the Gentiles we
[32:30] would then have to be adopted
[32:33] we had no religious rights no no parts
[32:36] to be doing we would have to be adopted
[32:39] into the family and that's your new
[32:42] birth that's Romans like 8:14 that you
[32:46] would come to to being heirs and joint
[32:48] heirs by new birth and we
[32:51] beware the Prophet would cover it like
[32:53] Paul covered it how that Paul would talk
[32:55] about the adoption and the baby being a
[32:58] baby
[32:59] it was born to baby it was born to child
[33:02] all right but he didn't have the the
[33:05] training and it would be given a tutor
[33:07] to to train you and grow you up through
[33:11] the statute of a perfect man
[33:12] all right then it would come to her that
[33:16] he could trust you and he could give you
[33:19] the Signet of authority we're not trying
[33:22] to go out and I ain't never tried so you
[33:24] just think what you want to you think
[33:26] well you've this morning you laid it
[33:27] down anything it what is it all you
[33:29] won't do about what you think about me I
[33:31] ain't never been one trying to go to the
[33:33] backside of the desert and get a message
[33:35] I got a message
[33:38] it's called William branham's prophets
[33:40] message I don't need a message the
[33:43] Prophet brought the message now it's
[33:46] delivered to you and I but it's got to
[33:48] be understood and there's where you talk
[33:50] about now you can place this if you want
[33:52] to exalt it do what you want to it is
[33:54] left for the sons and daughters of God
[33:57] to make this message manifest or make
[34:01] known that's what I've been trying to do
[34:06] for 50 years make known the trying to
[34:11] show it stood back darkness was talking
[34:13] want to go about it you've heard me tell
[34:15] it over and over to stand back there
[34:16] forty years ago and said the biggest
[34:19] portion of the people of this message
[34:20] going to die and go by the grain and in
[34:22] no way did I have any form of thoughts
[34:24] then are now asked that they were not
[34:27] Christians I'm talking about true
[34:30] born-again Christians in the message are
[34:32] going to die and go by the grave code
[34:34] they don't know what the message is
[34:35] these people running all down doing
[34:38] these thing well that ain't nothing I
[34:40] stood back there and told you another
[34:42] thing I said it'll come a time I said
[34:45] you think it's deceiving when the two
[34:47] souls to Lourdes and the virtues and all
[34:50] of the things come out back there in the
[34:51] 70s that's you think this is hard I said
[34:54] it's going to come a time when they'll
[34:55] use the message against you well look
[34:58] what they're doing now they're picking
[34:59] apart brother Browns message now they've
[35:02] attacked of doctrinal issues
[35:05] the message in picking it and picking it
[35:07] and what sickens mean it sickens me to
[35:10] realize and oh we come down through
[35:13] Baptist churches that women didn't cut
[35:15] their higher I'm talking about 50s and
[35:17] things right and see me being old enough
[35:20] 79 years old I will remember it and all
[35:23] to do it that and then coming in into
[35:26] the message and seeing the Prophet
[35:29] teaching those things about the woman's
[35:30] higher well what's the first thing
[35:32] happens when somebody backslides now if
[35:36] you hadn't paid attention to that wake
[35:37] up first thing happens it's like the man
[35:41] up north up dark that is his daddy or
[35:44] brother you know he stayed with him but
[35:47] then he slipped off first thing they've
[35:49] done women cut her hair
[35:52] well that's Bible that ain't something
[35:56] brother branham come up with this Bible
[36:00] why would that be the first thing shows
[36:03] what it is so it was a demon that was
[36:05] sitting back in there wantin to do that
[36:08] showed it was a demon and the preachers
[36:10] that wanted to do these things and
[36:12] they're getting all kind of things okay
[36:14] get off it
[36:15] but listen getting down to your life
[36:20] you've got to have an experience of the
[36:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth
[36:24] brings you into the body of Christ
[36:26] adopts you into the body all right to be
[36:31] a son and daughter of God as a baby
[36:33] statue a perfect man adoptions etc
[36:37] brings you up through that pyramid did
[36:39] he come out to the basis of what then
[36:43] God can say to a group of people he said
[36:48] by the new birth when he gives it to you
[36:49] this is my believe this is my son in
[36:52] whom I'm pleased to dwell like I said it
[36:56] a minute ago now I mean it seriously I
[36:58] can if you can't say that that don't
[37:01] apply to you now listen if you can't say
[37:05] that God said there I'm pleased to dwell
[37:08] then he did not come in your put your
[37:13] patent you're getting your own things he
[37:16] didn't come in
[37:18] but if he was pleased to dwell then he
[37:21] came in sorry for that pertinent but
[37:25] it's true because that's as serious as
[37:28] can be if he didn't come in here he he
[37:31] knows he's not welcomed but if he did
[37:34] come into this body and give me the new
[37:36] birth then he was pleased to dwell he
[37:40] wanted to be there anais can't see that
[37:43] well then you tell me what you say let's
[37:48] just decrease it not everything go home
[37:50] no see but there's still a headstone
[37:55] it's got to come I've taught you for
[37:59] 40-something years and I still believe
[38:00] it more today and ever did then the
[38:03] toast seals was this headstone to the
[38:06] church because you show me something
[38:08] else to come I'm open
[38:12] floors open come show me something else
[38:14] to come the seventh seal is broke the
[38:19] Bible said it was the prophet said it
[38:21] was but yet we've got 98% of the people
[38:24] that's been the seal doesn't broke I
[38:26] agree with you they're not broke to them
[38:31] but that don't mean it can't be broke to
[38:33] somebody right and why can't we believe
[38:36] with that somebody that's all I'm saying
[38:39] why can't we believe the our that we're
[38:42] living why can't we accept it and say
[38:46] this is the greatest thing that's ever
[38:48] happened it's for us to come to the
[38:52] basis of believing who we are don't you
[38:58] see I believe those field has to be
[38:59] broke to this if not what's your head
[39:03] I'm asking you I've asked the question
[39:06] ever since I've been in the message of
[39:08] it
[39:08] she'll be what the head is I'll show you
[39:10] what the cornerstone is I knew that in
[39:14] the Baptist Church we could read build
[39:16] on the foundation apostle prophet Jesus
[39:18] Christ being the chief Cornerstone we
[39:20] could read that the bad news all right
[39:25] we see that saddle it was the word
[39:30] the word just in the sample to head
[39:33] we're building what they say and Paul
[39:36] turned around what'd he say he said if
[39:38] anybody comes and says anything contrary
[39:40] to what I've said
[39:41] let them be a curse all right come on
[39:49] church have you received the new birth
[39:56] are you interested in the statue of a
[39:59] perfect man of growth development to
[40:02] where it would be revealed in our made
[40:04] manifest in me and you within somewhere
[40:07] there's a head to all of this and that
[40:09] head is a revealing of God's Word and
[40:13] it's something had to slap that on you
[40:15] it's revealing of God's Word that's the
[40:21] opening of the seven seals because the
[40:23] seven seals occurs before now listen on
[40:25] my quoting brother branham the seven
[40:27] seals is a full plan of redemption that
[40:29] true that's the full plan of redemption
[40:33] where's anything else to come well
[40:37] brother now I won't say it because you
[40:39] think I saw it but it's brother
[40:41] branham's to come back free something
[40:42] there
[40:43] he can't preach nothing contrary to the
[40:44] Bible you can't do that I'm not going
[40:50] off on these I tell you like it is if
[40:52] he's here he's screaming and glory about
[40:54] it he can't bring something contrary to
[40:56] the Bible well I get in the Bible to
[41:00] find out what the Bible says
[41:05] see then those seals will cap off the
[41:09] individual for their part because each
[41:12] one of us have to have don't quote see
[41:14] the Prophet I'll find this in you remind
[41:15] you he said all born-again believer to
[41:18] have a Mount Carmel experience Mount
[41:23] Carmel when they father got Elijah did
[41:25] with Balaam and he said our Mount Carmel
[41:29] is coming out of them denominations oh
[41:33] when you get something over into the
[41:34] seals there and we think what we just
[41:36] getting understand about to seal I
[41:38] remember brother mode asking we heard a
[41:40] brother down at Athens years ago
[41:41] preaching know when he was preaching
[41:43] about him seals not for sealing or he
[41:46] had this and he had that he had Russia
[41:47] he had China and he had this coming down
[41:50] I had to the service you know I brought
[41:51] him up Wars you know most of you know to
[41:53] me he had this little ways he could get
[41:56] under your skin just to her and he
[42:00] walked out to her to the brother and he
[42:01] said no brother he said I don't think we
[42:02] won't ask you where's all them people
[42:05] come from it fights that battle he said
[42:10] I don't know well mo says if you read
[42:14] the book you would go to Brown's death
[42:17] on the for sale come on am i right and
[42:20] me wants to quote what I'm fixing the
[42:21] quote for C or D say he said R comes in
[42:27] Protestants and Catholics reason for
[42:33] seal Protestants and Catholics coming
[42:36] after the bride gathering around Israel
[42:40] coming after Evans coming out to the
[42:42] bride that's where you battle that it's
[42:46] not a physical battle you know what I'm
[42:50] talking about that away it starts with
[42:52] their spiritual condition and then winds
[42:54] up into a physical battle Elijah was
[42:58] fighting it out where they have right
[43:01] but one day he had a physical contact
[43:04] where they have him he whacked his head
[43:06] off huh now listen church get what I'm
[43:11] talking about to him we have our own
[43:15] personal experience that God speaks to
[43:20] us personally I believe in that you know
[43:25] what God only speaks to the Prophet come
[43:26] on well the word only comes to the
[43:31] Prophet come on how long it will stay
[43:34] here the Prophet said that the word
[43:37] comes to the spirit feel
[43:42] well I guess there's none of a
[43:43] spirit-filled except a profit according
[43:45] to that yeah well what are we doing here
[43:51] huh what are we sitting here for let's
[43:55] go home forget the whole thing
[43:57] no I'm just dumb enough to go stag with
[44:00] it all these years I'm just dumb enough
[44:02] to go on through with it
[44:03] dumb is the best way I can say about Who
[44:05] I am go that's where I'll consider
[44:06] myself not consider one time this
[44:10] message come to speak and tell of you
[44:13] and I did the prophets they said
[44:17] there'll be a word born bride listening
[44:22] yesterday where he said to be delivered
[44:24] most of you know this birth plan be
[44:26] delivered of an new birth from according
[44:29] to Malachi 4 we're to be delivered of a
[44:35] new bar from Malachi 4 Malachi fours the
[44:38] thunders that brain fourth the pyramid
[44:40] in the Hall of thing well we had what
[44:46] are we doing are we dying what you see
[44:52] it's got to be in
[44:53] it's got to be revealed it's got to be
[44:59] revealed to us not to just talk about it
[45:03] but to be revealed the probably doesn't
[45:09] want to go over that when you begin to
[45:10] say I and my father one and these other
[45:11] things he said the Shocker pull away
[45:13] well we won't shut pull away what start
[45:16] saying I'm my father's one what does it
[45:19] mean to say I and my father's one that
[45:21] means he said hear you him oh but that's
[45:26] only for brother Branham now show me
[45:28] where that's that
[45:30] he was the example sure he was the start
[45:35] he was that but not just for him
[45:37] it's far the bride of Jesus Christ when
[45:42] you begin to realize who you are what
[45:43] you doing here well I don't see nothing
[45:47] going on we think you don't realize who
[45:48] you are you don't listen to what I've
[45:51] been saying now back up just to her
[45:55] listen if you was listening to what I
[45:57] said the Lord Jesus had River Jordan he
[46:07] comes through the statue of a perfect
[46:08] man through those times he grew in grace
[46:10] and knowledge is that what the Bible say
[46:13] is why because that human element was a
[46:16] flash outside when he come to a place
[46:20] that he was taken up on Mount
[46:22] Transfiguration and said here you him he
[46:24] said fight you ain't gonna get none else
[46:25] from me you're gonna hear him all right
[46:30] he did not to prophet come exactly the
[46:32] same way he had the Ohio River he had
[46:36] all the years of stature per man he had
[46:38] the opening of the seven seals he went
[46:40] dark connected came by
[46:44] and preach to the bride well I where's
[46:48] our Park it's to stay simple where's our
[46:53] part get a new birth steady the Word of
[46:57] God growth development into the statue
[47:00] of a perfect lamb these things until it
[47:02] comes to the manifestation of the sons
[47:04] and daughters of God what the time to
[47:06] make known now here I am still quoting
[47:10] it what you make him known he'll make
[47:12] you known and concerned with it I'm not
[47:17] I'm not I'm I'm a human being I don't
[47:19] want to see nobody to leave the church
[47:20] everybody thinks I'm so hard time no I
[47:22] want to see this church overflooded to
[47:24] work they would be running out to the
[47:25] seams right I want to follow in the God
[47:28] but takes one thing about it I want to
[47:31] walk in that word and just rest in that
[47:35] word and follow it because I know that's
[47:39] the only hope I got is the opening of
[47:43] the word all right then what would it
[47:47] wind up being so we go through the
[47:51] adoptions and we come out to that basis
[47:54] to the bride's got to come to a place
[47:56] that she can say I and my father one
[48:01] come to the place that you can say and
[48:06] talk about it all right
[48:07] no I've got him in there but don't worry
[48:10] about it the Prophet said it would come
[48:13] to a time that it would not be him
[48:18] talking it'd be you talking he's not
[48:21] that according to what is it Matthew 13
[48:23] or whatever it is through our
[48:24] leavenworth you know sailing to where
[48:28] it's not I that saith but you you
[48:39] it's left up to me and you left of
[48:43] somebody to become the word is that a
[48:46] hard thing to comprehend don't you
[48:48] simply become what God has wanted us to
[48:51] be that would become our husband to the
[48:54] basis that that we would be so much in
[48:56] love with him until we care less for
[48:58] these things of the world and we're
[49:00] still human but to come to the basis of
[49:05] saying I and my father one abroad
[49:11] and do you realize now watch what I'm
[49:13] getting at now okay here we go
[49:15] what start what has been my father what
[49:23] has been our thoughts from the beginning
[49:25] and this is number six message that we
[49:27] would not be dealing with what was back
[49:29] dark that's faith builders that's
[49:33] wonderful things but we've had that 50
[49:36] years and we are not changed yet all
[49:40] right but not to go that away forward to
[49:45] try to find something out there that
[49:46] will get us to something but come right
[49:51] back to where we are and do what the
[49:53] Prophet said not behind and not forward
[49:55] but to realize what's taking place right
[49:58] now we could look out there and see the
[50:04] world and it falling apart we can see
[50:06] the people of this message in it falling
[50:08] apart
[50:08] just leaving my flocks of them churches
[50:10] and all right
[50:15] we can see that taking place but to see
[50:20] that means there's something happening
[50:26] that wasn't read down there or talking
[50:29] to you the other day to find that work
[50:30] brother branham said and it hit me I
[50:33] mean you can't turn a corner now Saint
[50:35] bill in the building you can't turn a
[50:37] corner cain't building a house or a
[50:39] bunch of houses or condominiums or
[50:43] tens or something you want to take a
[50:45] little ride down to 285 and look at that
[50:48] building a downer hunt what that's a
[50:50] hundred or something bays in one
[50:53] building
[50:55] now they've got the big battery place
[50:58] over the higher they said going to work
[50:59] two two five seven thousand and and all
[51:01] these houses just popping up everywhere
[51:03] why cuz they're gonna sell it to them
[51:05] people what the Prophet said look at all
[51:09] the building that's going on he said
[51:10] that's the sign of the end of all the
[51:12] time and my goodness if that's happening
[51:15] around here what's happening all over
[51:16] the world build and build and build and
[51:21] everything crash your profits per but
[51:26] listen you realize then I'm putting this
[51:33] on the basis of my own thoughts because
[51:36] that's where I'm on state approach it
[51:38] because there always have been
[51:40] somebody's got to realize who they are
[51:42] and what they're doing somebody's got to
[51:49] realize that somebody's got to come to
[51:52] the basis of saying we're here without
[51:57] having that I don't see it somebody's
[52:07] gonna have to make it manifest as I said
[52:10] this morning with what they without us
[52:11] they means there's somebody without us
[52:15] that means us they can't be made perfect
[52:18] and I hope you understood that perfect
[52:21] that's the same as Matthew 5:48 be
[52:23] therefore perfect even as your father in
[52:25] heaven is perfect
[52:26] alright because that word perfect means
[52:28] complete are finished we're not complete
[52:30] today we need to redemption to the body
[52:32] I believe brother Branham was us was a
[52:37] full manifested Son of God adopted
[52:40] positionally placed in the body of
[52:42] Christ don't you I do I always believed
[52:46] that after I hurt him but you know water
[52:51] he didn't make a change
[52:56] he's waiting on us oh no no no no okay
[53:00] then you tell me what you waiting on
[53:03] ain't making it the wrong way
[53:05] you are me all right so everything's
[53:11] waiting on me and you well I mean ain't
[53:15] nowhere you ain't got nothin ain't got
[53:17] nothin either more that's really us
[53:19] answer when we're gonna begin to say
[53:26] sister Trudy she is what 80 now 81
[53:34] that's Trudy McGillicuddy you're not

[1:00:20] of chicken was until I got married I

[1:00:50] bother me and see I wouldn't change for
[1:00:53] nothing I wouldn't change it would make
[1:00:57] no difference because you have done all
[1:00:59] right Ben we heard of the message we
[1:01:03] heard of the message there in this late
[1:01:05] sixties 66 brother molt and I started
[1:01:08] riding to work together he started
[1:01:11] talking about God sending a prophet and
[1:01:14] we begin to accept that 67 somewhere in
[1:01:18] the 67 we left a Baptist Church when I
[1:01:23] started in this message been enjoying it
[1:01:26] ever since bad days hard days I heard a
[1:01:32] lot of heartaches in this message of a
[1:01:34] lot of people turning against me because
[1:01:35] of the way I believed and what I say it
[1:01:37] and what I stood for but still I don't
[1:01:39] have no problem and I have no hard
[1:01:42] feelings against any of
[1:01:46] what I put under the blood stays under
[1:01:49] the blood
[1:01:50] if you dig it out you got a problem
[1:01:54] that's the best I can say it about
[1:01:56] anything you live your life before
[1:01:59] people that let them be that sure I got
[1:02:01] plenty of problems you don't talk about
[1:02:03] problems we prop up all day on them but
[1:02:06] now listen can you say you've enjoyed
[1:02:11] yourself can you say right now that
[1:02:13] you're enjoying can you say right now
[1:02:18] that you're enjoying the fact that
[1:02:20] you're in this message and believing it
[1:02:22] and doing would you like to walk across
[1:02:24] the road and and be happy and joyous and
[1:02:28] do the other thing and become a good
[1:02:30] denominational person are you trying to
[1:02:33] sit and listen bro they'll beat you
[1:02:34] death well what about it Danny where we
[1:02:41] go have you ever thought about but we're
[1:02:49] gonna cover predestination it may take a
[1:02:50] couple of messages at essaouira brother
[1:02:55] branham we've all been messed up on
[1:02:59] predestination cause we had it made up
[1:03:01] we go oh I'm glad I fell off of that
[1:03:03] thing because if I hadn't of fell off
[1:03:04] I'd have had to have done it later down
[1:03:06] the road we had it all figured out
[1:03:07] predestination was this a way of
[1:03:09] predestination was that way and now in
[1:03:11] the message they got this predestinated
[1:03:13] these seeds and they run this seed and
[1:03:16] they run that seed and run backwards and
[1:03:17] forth all in predestination somebody
[1:03:24] asked me a question we might even cover
[1:03:25] predestined thanks cuz listen it's very
[1:03:29] simple to me very very simple the Bible
[1:03:34] says and the Prophet says those who he
[1:03:40] foreknew all right now we all got to go
[1:03:45] without forty those who he foreknew he
[1:03:48] did what he predestinated so how does he
[1:03:53] predestinate
[1:03:55] by his foreknowledge that goes back
[1:04:01] before the world Africa since what
[1:04:03] everybody wanted for knowledge down here
[1:04:04] but then go back before the world the
[1:04:06] Prophet said it goes all the way back
[1:04:07] the Bible said it I just read it to you
[1:04:10] I just read it the Bible said that were
[1:04:15] predestinated unto adoption and your
[1:04:20] prophet said there was never an age like
[1:04:24] this age because nobody's ever reached
[1:04:30] this age you thinking about glory and
[1:04:34] how great that I feel about the this
[1:04:37] builds me up inside the thing what God
[1:04:39] is reserved for this endtime people then
[1:04:42] it just tired my heart out to see us
[1:04:43] just going and casting that down and you
[1:04:46] just thinking there's garbage Ken but he
[1:04:51] predestinated us unto adoption you
[1:04:56] realize what that means
[1:04:59] you're predestinated to a place
[1:05:06] predetermined to be at that place now
[1:05:12] you see what I've been doing for 40
[1:05:14] years trying to get you to realize we're
[1:05:15] yet you predestinated to be sitting
[1:05:18] right here tonight do you believe it
[1:05:24] do you believe that God before the world
[1:05:27] saw you would be sitting here if you
[1:05:30] don't you need to get your Bible and
[1:05:33] read it because dollars worth if there's
[1:05:39] anything of the future to be a fake
[1:05:41] builder it's a great part of relight and
[1:05:43] what taking place right now the Prophet
[1:05:50] said we're predestinated by
[1:05:51] foreknowledge he said not to the basis
[1:05:55] that God has picked out one it didn't
[1:05:57] pick out the other one you only read him
[1:06:00] he said but he predestinated us and he
[1:06:04] said there is no way that that cannot
[1:06:07] come to pass
[1:06:09] right you mean there's something the
[1:06:12] Word of God I can't come to pipes come
[1:06:14] on
[1:06:15] quote you big man this message said
[1:06:18] these things in the Bible that me and
[1:06:20] the Prophet talked about that will never
[1:06:23] come to pass
[1:06:24] well now let's see it's business but I'm
[1:06:31] there they believe it did away I don't
[1:06:34] believe he's talking to the Prophet they
[1:06:36] say worse things in the Bible that
[1:06:37] wouldn't go come to Pais why would he
[1:06:42] put it in the Bible yeah I call it
[1:06:49] stupidity maybe it shouldn't be said
[1:06:51] that's strong that's alright I just
[1:06:54] agree with one time if God said it it's
[1:06:59] gonna take place and you can do all you
[1:07:05] want to and you ain't gonna stop it but
[1:07:14] if you don't believe it you can hammer
[1:07:15] all you want to and you ain't going to
[1:07:17] them to it either is that simple
[1:07:21] predestination
[1:07:22] he said God don't predestinate the way
[1:07:26] we think he said the way we think
[1:07:28] he said we predestinate like put you at
[1:07:30] a pipe and just push you through the
[1:07:32] other end he said where would there be
[1:07:34] any overcoming or anything involved if
[1:07:38] it was that a way see God wants you to
[1:07:41] realize what you're doing
[1:07:43] when we get out of this world we could
[1:07:45] talk about what we sing what we've done
[1:07:47] wouldn't we solve this when we saw that
[1:07:49] you remember when we when you saw this
[1:07:51] right here in the Bible I'm thinking to
[1:07:56] be a glorious time to be able to just
[1:08:00] sit down and talk about it
[1:08:09] he did predestinate one to be saved and
[1:08:12] one to be lost no way he predestinated
[1:08:19] about foreknowledge go ahead and pull
[1:08:23] this one up for certain because you want
[1:08:25] it go to the number forward brothers and
[1:08:27] on the the screen and let's just get
[1:08:31] this one because this one it's the one
[1:08:32] that we we hang out together with cuz
[1:08:35] here's a Summerlin church age are the
[1:08:37] church age book every which way you want
[1:08:39] to go up 154 and he's talking about I
[1:08:44] before I close this subject I know
[1:08:46] there's a question in your minds you
[1:08:48] will wonder you will want to know if I
[1:08:51] believe in the doctor of pre-existence
[1:08:52] now listen to it I don't believe in that
[1:08:55] Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of
[1:08:58] souls any more than I believe in
[1:09:02] reincarnation our transmigration of
[1:09:04] souls now he said he didn't believe in
[1:09:07] well they you quoted all you want to you
[1:09:10] go how to come back to that one called
[1:09:12] here's why be careful here and see this
[1:09:14] it is not the person that comes
[1:09:17] predestinated eternally from God it is
[1:09:23] the word our seed now he's got a little
[1:09:30] word and iris picked up a lot eternally
[1:09:35] all right let's think about
[1:09:38] predestination for a minute so it's not
[1:09:44] did he picked one and didn't pick the
[1:09:46] other he said by foreknowledge he knew
[1:09:51] who would accept him and who wouldn't is
[1:09:54] that simple that's a simple plan of
[1:09:57] redemption
[1:09:57] alright he knew who would be saved who
[1:10:00] what he knew that before the foundation
[1:10:02] of the world
[1:10:06] so then everything everybody ever NAT
[1:10:11] that matches I everything that ever
[1:10:14] happens in the world God by
[1:10:15] foreknowledge knew that would take place
[1:10:18] you agree that's a simple summation of
[1:10:24] foreknowledge then he knows everything
[1:10:29] there's nothing that could ever happen
[1:10:31] that he didn't already know it so we're
[1:10:37] not pulling anything over on him to try
[1:10:39] to fool with our little thoughts of
[1:10:42] predestination cuz that's where we'll
[1:10:46] come to well if it's that away
[1:10:48] what hope of I God you never heard that
[1:10:52] arguments he said what hope I got if
[1:10:55] it's already by foreknowledge
[1:10:57] but just remember what he done he
[1:11:00] predestinated buys foreknowledge he
[1:11:05] didn't make it take place he just knew
[1:11:09] it would simple logic of understanding
[1:11:16] that the Bible is the Word of God and
[1:11:23] then he predestinated everything by his
[1:11:30] foreknowledge right now he follow me
[1:11:33] thought number one everything everybody
[1:11:38] every move everything we do is all
[1:11:42] predestinated by God's foreknowledge if
[1:11:46] not thought away cuz you have him
[1:11:52] picking and choosing and that don't work
[1:11:56] all right
[1:11:58] he said well well now you just make the
[1:12:01] predestination like a bad bit from the
[1:12:03] thought all right we had some
[1:12:05] predestination Presbyterians had a
[1:12:06] predestination form all right and you
[1:12:11] know we could read that those who he
[1:12:13] foreknew
[1:12:15] you don't remember read that in the
[1:12:17] Bible those that he foreknew he did
[1:12:20] predestinate well what that means those
[1:12:25] that he knew see you're getting the
[1:12:28] wrong way to go with it he knew what you
[1:12:33] and I would want that's why the thing
[1:12:38] formed can't say why did you form me
[1:12:40] this way because he didn't form us out a
[1:12:42] way my brother is the Methodist preacher
[1:12:45] and he said God can't condemn me for for
[1:12:47] living in sin code he made me a sinner I
[1:12:48] said wait just a minute he didn't make
[1:12:50] you a sinner he made you with an equal
[1:12:52] choice and he's 12 years in college and
[1:12:56] he made you an equal choice and you
[1:13:00] chose which one to go so he can't blame
[1:13:03] him for the choice you made
[1:13:05] right because you made your choice okay
[1:13:09] all right now so then if that be true
[1:13:16] now if you follow me that away and I
[1:13:17] ain't asking you to bow down oh I
[1:13:20] believe that brother Dale I'm just
[1:13:21] asking you to be sensible does that
[1:13:23] sound okay that God predestinate spies
[1:13:27] foreknowledge now let's go to the next
[1:13:29] Dale all right the Prophet said it's not
[1:13:34] the person that comes predestinated
[1:13:38] eternally from God see ever person
[1:13:41] country that's never before knowledge
[1:13:43] right every human being every movement
[1:13:47] everything that every time it bad it's
[1:13:49] high everything come about God's
[1:13:50] foreknowledge right but it's not the
[1:13:55] person that comes pre-designated
[1:13:57] eternally it's the word our seed all
[1:14:03] right now right here at hold on just a
[1:14:06] second irregardless of what you think
[1:14:11] about predestination there's got to be
[1:14:15] somebody to make live the word truth
[1:14:23] simple simple terminology simple logic
[1:14:26] there's got to be somebody to make it
[1:14:28] live there's got to be somebody for it
[1:14:30] to live in all right so then God by his
[1:14:34] foreknowledge knew that Martin Luther
[1:14:36] would be on the earth and what he would
[1:14:42] do and all the things that would go in
[1:14:44] life by his foreknowledge but at the
[1:14:54] same time it's foreknowledge they knew
[1:14:55] what he knew his foreknowledge showed
[1:14:58] they'd be a seed the seed was the just
[1:15:01] shall live by faith come on who at
[1:15:06] Martin Luther God said God said it
[1:15:14] there's a seed predestination
[1:15:21] predestinated eternally so Luther's
[1:15:26] message was eternally predestinated
[1:15:28] which meant it was going to come to pies
[1:15:33] all Luther got was a prop was the
[1:15:36] opportunity for it to live within him
[1:15:40] cuz that's all I'm bragging about
[1:15:42] anything it's what God does you realize
[1:15:44] all I'm making out of you and me or
[1:15:46] anything anything on predestination you
[1:15:48] come to we're going to come to one place
[1:15:49] that God did choose you because he knew
[1:15:58] you would accept it there's his
[1:16:01] foreknowledge so Martin Luther not
[1:16:06] Martin Luther now that's predestinated
[1:16:08] by foreknowledge he knew everything he'd
[1:16:10] ever do and what dude wouldn't do Martin
[1:16:14] Luther what about him being a great man
[1:16:15] like he was and picking this to the
[1:16:17] church age messenger huh and you know
[1:16:19] what he said he said him Jews when we
[1:16:20] took on kill I don't sound too good for
[1:16:27] a man of God but you know what
[1:16:31] that wasn't predestination eternally
[1:16:32] that was the foreknowledge of God that
[1:16:35] knew what Luther would do
[1:16:38] huh so what they're in that 1500 when it
[1:16:43] was time bracket they came a time back
[1:16:48] up 1 2 sermons a time not far right not
[1:16:54] a town far Luther to come on the scene
[1:16:56] a town - Luther to come on the scene not
[1:17:00] far because it just puts it in the wrong
[1:17:02] category coming back to that message
[1:17:04] it's the time to all things so when that
[1:17:08] word struck the earth by God's
[1:17:12] foreknowledge there was a man there that
[1:17:15] would receive that word and go forth and
[1:17:22] preach the just shall live by faith
[1:17:24] didn't matter if it cost him his life
[1:17:26] cost him everything that's not just for
[1:17:31] knowledge the man and his message become
[1:17:34] one well hope you can follow the man and
[1:17:42] his message became one and he walked out
[1:17:49] to her and he said I don't understand it
[1:17:53] I've read this preached on it had
[1:17:56] commentaries wrote on it and everything
[1:17:58] else here what it is and was it wrong
[1:18:01] when to defeat which one predestinate
[1:18:03] you know Martin Luther coming out her
[1:18:07] other just shall live by faith and he
[1:18:11] wrote they say write on the side of
[1:18:13] alone I got that wrote in my Bible he
[1:18:17] predestinated my has foreknowledge but a
[1:18:22] man had to be there for it to live in
[1:18:27] the seed had to have a place to land
[1:18:31] right and see what it did that right
[1:18:38] there now listen to what I'm saying
[1:18:42] predestinated unto adoption
[1:18:49] darzee new birth represented in Martin
[1:18:51] Luther ours you predestinated them to
[1:18:56] adoption it started right there started
[1:18:59] wailing back but I'm just finalizing it
[1:19:01] where you'll understand so in the days
[1:19:03] of Martin Luther that new birth that he
[1:19:05] received was the message of the just
[1:19:08] shall live by faith
[1:19:12] there's he seed the message the man
[1:19:17] become one with a message when he first
[1:19:20] started out he probably would just you
[1:19:22] know I don't like this hour cuz this
[1:19:24] cording to his records from time Martin
[1:19:26] Luther was not wanting to leave
[1:19:28] according to his brother his ones one
[1:19:30] book on he didn't want to leave the
[1:19:31] Catholic Church he wanted to convert to
[1:19:33] Catholic Church that's why I wind up in
[1:19:38] revelation he wanted to convert to
[1:19:41] church but then when he seen he couldn't
[1:19:44] convert it he just spent his theses and
[1:19:48] said here it is the just shall live by
[1:19:53] faith alone or only whatever you wanna
[1:20:01] put it so that was a predestinated unto
[1:20:04] adoption for Martin Luther just a new
[1:20:08] birth and remember what I said when I
[1:20:10] started don't get confused about it one
[1:20:12] two three adoption all because remember
[1:20:14] he had to be doctored in the family
[1:20:15] Luther was adopted into the family by
[1:20:17] the new birth you was adopted into the
[1:20:19] family by the new birth alright so keep
[1:20:21] it in the right order
[1:20:22] alright see there no long come a man
[1:20:26] named John Wesley the world had got so
[1:20:31] messed up under Luther's teaching but
[1:20:39] not under Luther I remember a brother at
[1:20:43] my house he was talking about something
[1:20:45] and I pointed my finger down on what
[1:20:47] brother Branham said I said would you
[1:20:48] mind reading what brother Branham say it
[1:20:49] he looked down and he said I ain't
[1:20:51] reading that
[1:20:54] that's come on you talk about reading
[1:20:56] the message you talk about read it
[1:20:59] brother Dale read what that says right
[1:21:01] there he said I ain't gonna do it
[1:21:03] you know what said brother Brent said to
[1:21:07] Lutheran's denominated and died they do
[1:21:11] you need that quote he wouldn't dare
[1:21:13] Hannah laughs see what Luther's that
[1:21:16] denominated they denominated his message
[1:21:20] the Lutheran denominated and died I have
[1:21:25] no problem reading what the Prophet said
[1:21:26] what you see he was trapped he didn't go
[1:21:29] to open his mouth cuz you know I'm sorry
[1:21:31] I'm just that independent but I meant
[1:21:34] for him to say something just like that
[1:21:35] feller told me one time he said first
[1:21:38] Corinthians 13 there what it is about
[1:21:39] the gifts and all he said nor just take
[1:21:42] that out of the Bible I said him in your
[1:21:43] Bible I'm serious
[1:21:48] I send me a Bible he's ain't getting my
[1:21:52] Bible I said hey you know better and
[1:21:54] hand it to me
[1:21:54] you know what I'd have done out of
[1:21:56] toward 13 out of it then either went and
[1:21:59] bought him a new Bible I would be no
[1:22:00] problem but he knew better to hand me
[1:22:04] that Bible code he knew I was gonna tear
[1:22:05] it up cuz you see that's not right
[1:22:11] Martin Luther brought a message
[1:22:15] those people are beyond the curtain of
[1:22:17] time waiting on you and me whatever you
[1:22:22] believe about all these others whatever
[1:22:24] just remember the New Testament and it
[1:22:26] is waiting but when John Wesley came on
[1:22:30] the scene he saw the world in such a
[1:22:32] horrible situation till he started
[1:22:35] preaching sanctification
[1:22:39] alright sanctification started dealing
[1:22:42] with the individual to bring an
[1:22:45] individual to the place of cleansing us
[1:22:47] setting us aside getting ready to bring
[1:22:50] forth in this John Wesley's he began to
[1:22:55] teach that he said lo that I came to
[1:22:58] America to convert the heathen said come
[1:22:59] find out I needed to be converted myself
[1:23:04] so he saw the message thing John Wesley
[1:23:09] was predestinated eternally from God not
[1:23:12] John Wesley the man the message didn't
[1:23:18] even brought but you had to be a man for
[1:23:21] the masses to dwell in that way you're
[1:23:24] not doing away with this and try to put
[1:23:25] this over here
[1:23:26] put it right they had to be a Lord Jesus
[1:23:30] Christ to walk upon the earth to be God
[1:23:32] manifested in human flesh right I'm John
[1:23:38] Wesley begin to bring the message he was
[1:23:41] predestinated to a position Luther was
[1:23:45] predestinated to justification Wesley
[1:23:48] was predestinated to sanctification
[1:23:50] what do you mean predestinated eternally
[1:23:53] not in sales not the human body those
[1:23:58] had to be there but the message was
[1:24:00] predestinated that seed struck the earth
[1:24:03] of the just shall live by faith
[1:24:06] turn the world upside down
[1:24:08] John Wesley come forward with a message
[1:24:13] Azusa Street came forth with a message
[1:24:21] of the gifts the Prophet would call it
[1:24:24] and the baptism of the holy ghost your
[1:24:30] prophet said just like on the day of
[1:24:31] Pentecost see if people don't believe
[1:24:35] that so how are you gonna deal with
[1:24:36] predestination then forget it if you
[1:24:38] can't see that that the Holy Ghost was
[1:24:40] the same Holy Ghost on the Susur Street
[1:24:42] as it was in the book of Acts
[1:24:43] then what hold ago see that have you got
[1:24:45] a Holy Ghost here to another differ Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost I'll well where's the Holy Ghost
[1:24:48] of that no see the word struck and that
[1:24:56] begin a situation of the baptism of the
[1:25:00] Holy Ghost and when your prophet came on
[1:25:02] the scene there in the thirties in time
[1:25:06] he started preaching the baptism with
[1:25:11] the Holy Ghost
[1:25:15] the gifts the restoration of all things
[1:25:20] he began to preach about Malachi 4 they
[1:25:26] began to talk about them things of how
[1:25:28] the word was to be restored it started
[1:25:33] than an adoption statue a perfect man
[1:25:39] begin to be taught are predestinated
[1:25:45] what was the Zeus the street come on
[1:25:49] folks I've had him right here in this
[1:25:50] pulpit and I don't approach the man
[1:25:52] before then told him he's wrong the man
[1:25:54] stood in this booklet right here and
[1:25:55] said it the Pentecostals was wrong it
[1:25:58] says false I done told him that wouldn't
[1:26:01] ride that didn't change him did you see
[1:26:07] oh he's got a big nine yeah he was the
[1:26:10] one that said he couldn't preach error
[1:26:11] so you go do what you want to you don't
[1:26:13] know who I'm talking about
[1:26:17] I'm just being serious you realize on
[1:26:23] the zoo the street that was the most
[1:26:25] glorious situation that ever happened
[1:26:28] you realize brother Branham right after
[1:26:31] Azusa Street made this statement he said
[1:26:33] they were closer to the coming of the
[1:26:35] Lord than we are do you need to quote I
[1:26:37] know there's one head and one head it
[1:26:39] goes with it that'll agree with it we
[1:26:40] can find that quote for you because it
[1:26:47] was God moving among the people living
[1:26:50] in the people and the gifts and signs
[1:26:52] and wonders not just gifts the signs and
[1:26:56] wonders and then the word begin to come
[1:26:57] forth the prophet coming forward
[1:27:00] bringing his message and as he began to
[1:27:05] bring his message they begin to develop
[1:27:06] on through into the statue of perfume
[1:27:08] and into the tea and then on into the
[1:27:13] opening of the word now if you follow
[1:27:16] what I'm saying so I'll make it five now
[1:27:18] cause 22 for and we'll quit you realize
[1:27:22] what I'm talking about if there's any
[1:27:24] questions you've been glad try to answer
[1:27:26] them
[1:27:29] predestinated unto adoption not
[1:27:34] predestinated under for knowledge
[1:27:41] poor knowledge is not adoption
[1:27:47] predestinated unto adoption to word that
[1:27:51] it would come the baptism of the holy
[1:27:54] ghost statue of a perfect man come out
[1:27:56] the opening of the seven seals
[1:27:59] somebody's predestinated to that place
[1:28:02] you understand what it says in the
[1:28:04] Ephesians that we've read said he
[1:28:06] predestinated us unto unto means travel
[1:28:10] from here to there unto those drums
[1:28:13] means I've got to make a journey to the
[1:28:15] drums onto in this day God is expecting
[1:28:20] the people because he's already brought
[1:28:22] us the word we already have the seed
[1:28:25] what do we need
[1:28:26] worse than that brother it's Britain's
[1:28:29] message which is the Bible that's the
[1:28:34] eternal part and that means somebody is
[1:28:38] going to be here somebody is going to
[1:28:42] make this message live it might be if I
[1:28:45] tried to preach that brother branham
[1:28:48] coming off of out there and when he come
[1:28:51] off will not die preaching and getting
[1:28:53] those still it was just a short time
[1:28:55] brother Brennan was off the scene
[1:28:57] because that would have been sixty three
[1:28:59] three years or so or less he preached
[1:29:03] the seals and he done left to sing the
[1:29:05] Lord Jesus are done I'm trying to get
[1:29:07] you to see it I ain't trying to make no
[1:29:08] fiery bed of these now make no badshah
[1:29:11] stroke story but both of those examples
[1:29:13] wound up costing those two men in their
[1:29:16] lives you realize what we believe what
[1:29:20] I'm saying here that I saw this 40 years
[1:29:23] ago that if I preach it and get it to
[1:29:25] the right place somebody's gonna die for
[1:29:27] what they believe you may not be me but
[1:29:32] if I die don't write on my tombstone he
[1:29:35] died as a failure don't write on there
[1:29:37] he with all people oh yeah I'm a human I
[1:29:39] get
[1:29:40] down-and-out oh yeah I get to myself and
[1:29:42] I cried I weep
[1:29:48] but somewhere somebody is going to catch
[1:29:54] the message right and it's going to be
[1:29:57] made manifest and it will be the seed
[1:30:00] because the seed is what comes
[1:30:02] predestinated eternally not the person
[1:30:05] but there's got to be a person for it to
[1:30:07] live in come on they had to be a Martin
[1:30:11] Luther Jim Jones couldn't handle it
[1:30:15] Samuel Dale couldn't handle it neither
[1:30:18] could you
[1:30:19] we couldn't handle Luther's message he
[1:30:24] was a special pick man because God could
[1:30:27] look down through and see exactly what
[1:30:29] it would take
[1:30:30] what did brother Ron say about Abraham
[1:30:33] he said God knew that Abraham would
[1:30:37] teach his family right he had his
[1:30:44] confidence in a man he knew would teach
[1:30:46] his family why because it's for dolly he
[1:30:48] looked down this reason what it already
[1:30:50] done but is God out there waiting on me
[1:30:54] and you come on I'm ending it with this
[1:30:57] part
[1:30:57] come on musician if God out there
[1:30:59] waiting only in you he's got back that
[1:31:01] way to go menu God's here your prophet
[1:31:06] said it one day he said I'm not saying
[1:31:08] he's coming I'm saying he's here we know
[1:31:15] we gonna begin to say that he's here
[1:31:20] let's believe it because the ain't
[1:31:24] you've got to be sometime right but
[1:31:32] around said I'll have to back up right
[1:31:34] he's because he's certain things gonna
[1:31:36] take place you know you know the quote
[1:31:40] he said I've got to back up wait on this
[1:31:43] out here well you know what I think 50
[1:31:46] years later most of that he was looking
[1:31:47] for must be here
[1:31:49] uh-oh kind of thinking that called what
[1:31:52] else was he looking for what else could
[1:31:55] you have you realize how close we live
[1:31:58] to death
[1:31:59] second that's not trying to scare nobody
[1:32:04] it's truth but do you realize true how
[1:32:14] wonderful it is to know God has taught
[1:32:18] enough of us to tell us what's going on
[1:32:23] to send a prophet that he could preach
[1:32:25] the word until you and me what's taking
[1:32:29] place and see the hour and the time that
[1:32:32] we're living
