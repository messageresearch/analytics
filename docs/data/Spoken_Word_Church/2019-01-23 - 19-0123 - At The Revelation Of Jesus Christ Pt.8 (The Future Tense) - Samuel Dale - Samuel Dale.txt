I want to see I want to say and me as a my heart my to say [Music] [Applause] shining in the light of your glory or out your power and [Music] amen [Applause] shining in the ladder came and you're loving Oh evil [Music] a man and a manatee good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in these scriptures we'll try to read it we've been reading in 1st Peter you know try to move on in the thought for Ken tonight remember now brother Vernon will be with us the Lord willing this coming Sunday to minister unto us so just pray it the Lord will bless he's supposed to fly in tomorrow night and glad we got I got everything straight that and somebody's been setting the whole day waiting on the other one because you know and it wouldn't it just misunderstanding then huh the Lord willing he's supposed to be with us and also remember now the Bible study will be these first Saturday in February so remember that and then remember the Valentine time during February and remember all of these announcements you know like it was I got you scripture first Peter maybe try to get far enough to pick up our thought of what we want to do in the church ages you know we'll try to want to try to this ease up to that spot and then we'll drop over into it the Lord within the next service but just probably one for another member Terrence had already asking remember my sister they said she wasn't it you know not doing no good over them to pray for for them I've got two sisters in nursing homes and one of them she doesn't even know where she's at hardly and but the other one is real sick so remember them they're up in their 80s in France the Lord would be with him father we thank you for your love and your understanding of each and every one of us and we praise you for the light of the hour that you have allowed us to receive and we just let we just ask you to let your light shine then from that into our hearts that we may have Lord what you want us to have and being where we're supposed to be help us to find out who we are and what's going on the time we're here and what we're doing would just be with each one be with my sisters our Lord and touch them and father this that your loving grace Peter I remember the other sickness among us and the ones that are are there that didn't get to come to not to be with us we pray that you'd touch through the internet and let everything go there and just go around the world and that's your word not return unto the void but to accomplish whatever it sent for we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen first Peter we're going back to read from verse 7 because we want to get the whole talk that they're trying of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory or at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith what is the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who profits out of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow under whom it was revealed that not unto themselves now it was revealed to him now then not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into okay now when we get to that part then what do we do where for our dire for Ernest let's get started now on this right core for gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought into you at the revelation of Jesus Christ amen now let's go over to revelations 1 and we'll start with verse now remember this is given to John to write to the churches he names them verse 11 verse 12 says and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters the prophet says many preachers witnesses page 57 church age book he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the Sun Shine ahthe in his strength and when I saw him I fell down at his feet as dead you know that his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and I have the keys of hell and of death write these things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks now here's the mystery the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try to get a thought and come right up to us part because we've read over now too and if you will read the church ages and things you know we will the Lord will then try to start with chapter two be in the first church age but I want you to follow a thought with me and keep that thought in mind if you remember when we started this series or thoughts we were talking about the marvelous thing that you could think about how the Bible came into being how did it actually came into being and how did it covers way it does there's no book nothing could ever be anything close to way the way the Bible is not that we talked about Moses that he could stand over here some 3,000 years I don't know exactly but you check it's come up close about 3,000 years after the creation of the world and things and he stands there and writes about what took place back there all right see then in his writing you know coming on through Genesis Exodus Leviticus and thought as he become on through then he would write of what was to take place and what was taking place all right see then he would go on to write of the future all right see now he he wrote that they would be down there in Egypt for so long and then their words are and then they you know they finally came out he wrote it they would come out so then it's past present and future all right now we're going to get into a little catchphrase I guess you called it a little cult as we enter this on the church ages because the church ages do not deal with the past I've told you I'm trying to get you to look at something about the Bible there is a pice tense a present tense and a future tense in the Bible all right but the further we get in toward the end of it you know the writings the way that it's written you you won't be covering the past you'll be covering the present and looking into the future but in this age only will the present tense and the future tense become one in other words everything will come to an end are you with me it'll come to an end all right so it'll come to a future tense in the Book of Revelations all right because now getting the point of what we've been talking about see John writes to the church ages right one two three four five six seven you realize that he stood back dire and he wasn't necessarily right in the past the Book of Revelations is not about the you say oh yeah tells this to tell come on this listen to what I'm talking about it's dealing more with present tense something's happening something we can see and follow it read it in the newspaper we can know it all right but then we know that there's a future tense that comes into view but now you see where we're going to have to go to because in this age the pice will be annihilated all right the present comes into view and you see the future but what about in this age when the present tense and the future tense becomes one now that's the thought for tonight because to me that's the way that we can see the reality of the Bible and what it's about all right now the prophets as we read they knew something was taking place and they wrote or testified of it and said things you know but it was really speaking the war to where we're you know we're at as Paul said all right now what you see a lot of the Old Testament we read that as a pice tense you know back time in excuse me how fast it yo attempts before a pice tense all right I want to make sure my words right because this does go out and it's bad enough to follow this old southern feller anyway but see when you're reading the Bible you read the Bible you read the Old Testament very little do you relate from the Old Testament into the New Testament other than tops and shadows showing something all right because it is already past all right now Jesus came and lived never wrote right he never wrote he was present tense you remember what we were getting at the life of the message last week or Sunday see the I am is ever-present for eternity all right see when Jesus came on the scene everything was present tense he may have spoke of future things but it was really present tense because once that future tense is reached it is present tense you remember that was the point I'm trying to get across Sunday get a present tense to something happening now I'm warning you to see the Bible is now being written not having to pin it it's being lived the the writing has caught up how would you say it the writing has caught up with the manifestation until it's actually living see what it's not reading a past tense Bible now there's things it was past tense right there was things in the Old Testament fast in some president tell most of it present and there was a future speaking of things to come but here comes the Lord Jesus never wrote a word why because he was present tense all right now the end did Paul in him write of a future or did they tell her what was taking place are you following in that they did write of the future now there was prophecy changed in a moment went through the night etc that's fine prophecies because it'll always be that until we reach that place really the all of those writers of the UH Matthew Mark Luke and John see they were not written till about 53 80 I mean 53 somewhere 50 something 80 50 we read where John says so it's on to remember that was not Penn and it's audited that Luke and Mark were not original disciples they would not die with the Lord Jesus when he said this time they were not writing down this that they were writing from their own and I love the Book of Luke that's always been even in the denomination I remember that I've always loved the Book of Luke you said well I like Mark or I like I like John and I like it I like Luke Luke starts off with the most marvelous statement that could ever be made by a man that maybe I'm just saying maybe never saw Jesus I don't know where he did or not just I didn't argue we if he's they did I'm just making a point that he was not dying with thee the disciples to walk with the Lord Jesus for three and I have here but look what he says when he first starts he said having perfect understanding now that's marvelous in really that's the first few words in in the Book of Luke having perfect understanding now you know he got most of his understanding about what took place to write by listening to somebody else right but see the reason I love the Book of Luke see if I'm going to argue between Mark and John or or whatever and there's three two I two blind men and one blind man on it you can generally go to the book of especially go to the book of John John is prophetic he's good but Luke says having perfect understanding or to get it they got it from what he heard right but he got it by revelation from the Word of God all right you get my point now Jesus never wrote a word I am present tense the disciples never rode right dire sea we think you know we always think there's John he's sitting on Jesus is talking and he's writing and he's know it's 50 years later before those were actually put in pen to me that's marvelous because it gives the opportunity for Satan to come in and try to change things but it gives the importance to it that the Holy Ghost can keep the word straight it don't make no difference what's going on with the world and what they're saying you understand what I'm getting at I don't care what they say in this message how this is this and that's bad and this is wrong here and that's there and this do it this message that means Jesus Christ so what you think about it and you're on the internet certain things and you think well he's wrong here or he was done this way I have no time to argue with you about anything don't send me an email won't you to discuss it because I'm gonna tell you my answer was on tape number date so-and-so because that's the way I preach this and that's where I stand all right are you getting the point here comes the Apostle Paul to be the first church age messenger right and he dies before JA never rots Bo's already dead for John went to patent all right it's a marvelous book to have and I don't mean this wrong God forgive me the only way I got sense enough to take something that would look like it could be the most easily wrong easily to be a bad book to read or whatever because of a lot of the things that you read in there then yet God keeps it straight that's wonderful that is wonderful to me all right cuz now look as I said over and over to get you to a point the Bible is the Word of God delivered to mankind and it deals with the age that you're living in all right now you followed me then see what about a time comes what is that song Oh what is it you slow down and I'll speed up or what is it that's your song like that or something Oh Aaron he's shaking his head so I hear there must be one what you see time and eternity is going to meet in this age not in the next days because there's not another age I don't care how much longer this age keeps going and how many of us dies put it on my tombstone if I die brother Dale is still looking for something to become more into a reality because that's what I've always looked for and I've always seen the Bible that way to see it as not a future something or even a highest of something but to see it as a reality of being right now and listen if you get it over and over this age the past and the present is going to catch up to the future go to future angle and slow down it's going to catch up all right then see why not cover it and think about it here's the Book of Revelations penned about 80 53 somewhere in there worry we don't John was on Patmos you know I mean 92 93 John don't Pat must to wrap the word alright now the first church age was already dwindling away but the time John writes what he's saying okay what said well okay that was some post but then Paul came on the scene as personal to the first church age still under that that's timing lapsed over even back but yet Paul is on the he's in a present perfect tense his writing wasn't guessing or planning or looking backwards or looking this way it was reality it was real when we see the Bible like that when you see it like that as a reality of life you'll see why brother Dale has always hollered so much about to recognize what's taking place what has taken place wonderful that's faith filter what's going to be in the future is great but we're not dying we're here but what about when here catches up with our you see what I'm driving after when all of this comes down to the bases that we see reality as a living reality of life and were wrapped in change our thoughts and make us happier about it to think God thought so much of us till he put us in his word never how you'd say that you know as part of it or what and then now he's revealing he's revealing himself go now remember the point so we back up just to her and come through remember the point where we started verse 1 2 & 3 then 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 through chapter 1 it showing who he is the Prophet said he wanted John to know who he was before he told him anything all right so it's revealing who he was or who he is then when you hit where was reading today with the twelfth verse coming down to the 13th it's coming in to seeing what something personal showing were here more feed him more feed through his death burial resurrection and the coming of the Holy Ghost back into the bride across him more feed itself right into the church in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks alright and as he does he's bringing reality to life cuz that's the whole point remember that remember that statement in a minute we'll get back as reality of life all right so he said all right I'm going to show you where I'm going I'm gonna in Morphy now I hope you caught the life stalks I was making on that message to think about that before we would ever begin our journey on earth that God would write until how perfect you are are you listening that God would write not to now we're gonna get into it because we're gonna have to divide it up we're gonna have to divide up something in the church ages so I want to hit there now I'll say what I'm gonna do and then we'll go back all right see we're gonna have to see that each church age starts off with a praise I want you to read the church ages and compare every one on first is a praise second is rebuke and the third what is it it's the overcomer yeah so what are we talking about before John before you write of the church ages and what's to transpire down through time you realize Who I am you realize where I've come to that I've been more feed into the bride to show you how perfect she is then that's up like I said when we pick up the pattern of the church edges you'll see it fall right in line he praises he rebukes in any types of away that'll be the whole scope if you'll read that with just those thoughts in mind you'll learn a lot about it that before he ever even it and there's a quote wrote around said something / phrasing like this but he said see there he said before he says anything to him he said he's gonna withhold that for a while he says he's gonna withhold that rebuking for a while you know why because he realized we're just babies and we need a little bit of petting and pampering and everything you know because we're babies in Christ all right now see then you'll see what I've been driving out where I am or Who I am where I am he morph into the bride and then take her totally out of this situation there's an overcomer so you get the point see he praises no let me say that again where you make sure you get it he tailed who he is then he tells where he went now do you think that he's gonna lose anybody in the church ages are the writing of the book from then on when he's already step told you how perfect you are yeah but I ain't perfect brother though we're not looking at what we think if we look at what we think we will never make it we're looking at what he says okay now we might wind up in trouble a lot of times we remember what I mean by that is he told Israel he said you would be down there for hundred years right but he said you'll be brought out by a strong hand okay because of Israel's rebelling not following God they were down there 430 years God didn't lie he just kind of wanted them to know a little bit about it in other words I told you to be down to four hundred years we said because of your rebellion to refuse me when I walked on the scene with Moses and you gonna get thirty more years which would probably work out to be 40 but you know it's just just I'm just quoting the scriptures that they were there the extra time because of their unbelief and they believed Moses when he come down they wouldn't have been there the rest of that time he was right on time Moses came exactly he didn't come 430 years he came exactly to the 400 years and says let's go then they said well bleed right said okay God says I'll just take Moses I can't keep him out here while he said when you get through playing around you get ready to get out of here well you don't want I love God for that he gives us choices and ways and done and because that we don't jump on the bandwagon and take off in a hurry the way he wants to go sometimes he just lets things roll well he knows yeah he knows he knew that he was going to give them 30 more years he wasn't pulling nothing over on God and he didn't lie about putting them there for hundred years they stayed for a year and they got 30 more because of rebelling I kind of think that's where we're at church about 30 40 years past the time of passing the prophet and all of the things and because of our rebellion his reason we here whether you like that or not that don't matter to me cuz I'm talking about me just as well as I'm talking about you why are we here 50 years after the going of a profit to see where they will stay with the order that to see where there will stay with the word when everything else goes wrong now you'll see that when you watch it and see how it does because first know he's showing you how perfect you are for your ring start okay now I hope that we'll finally dwell into you that he doesn't tell you how bad you are and then tell you how good you are he tells you how good you are then tell how really bad we are because of the way we go and then he comes back and tell us how good we are again okay now you following me so John in writing looks it is somewhere around 80 95 96 throw 93 95 and he's writing and he writes of what has happening but his main basis is what is happening and he speaks of a future to come now swallow yeah everybody ready you know one of these days are not going and they're the lysed overcomers don't overcome and you swallow enough to take that in one of these days the last overcomer is going to overcome now we know what the prophet said right it's not what we overcome right he said it's how we overcome now how do we overcome by being in him all right no so follow that doubted if they'll pick it up if they will go to I didn't give them this but I didn't intend to pick the thought that far go to chapter 2 of Revelation if you will brother Joe and never hurts back there and let us read it because I want you to read it I want you to see what I'm talking about that first he's going to praise now before it ever takes place we think I'm how bad to lady we'll see in church ages you know God looks down that far and said I don't see nothing now come on is it right he said okay but I got to rebuke you I said that I don't got left you so look at what it says unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walked in the midst of the seven golden Kenneth it this is who I am same point now grab for the longest who I am I'm the one doing if I'm doing this what I do I move into the church form alright now what I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how that thou canst not by them which are evil thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and it's found in lockers now that's bragging go to remember how the prophets you'll read the church age book you'll get all of these and I'd invite you to do that reading church age with the you know the part we're talking so what is he doing he's praising him and telling what they're doing and what they're doing is right and he doesn't bring out the wrong then he'll do it missed a second now but when he starts out he don't see they're wrong he bears with him I'll bring you that quote from the Prophet I got it so you're laying here at home one he said see that he said God just don't jump in there and start hammering away at him he said he understands you know what he understands he understands and he's gonna have to rebuke him he understands that they're going to go away from the word now here's the point I want you to remember because I've heard this argued a lot of people think that there's and there is there's two points in the church ages that are true and a false vine now I've heard this talk about believers in this message that the true bride was not rebuked in the ages it was the false that was reviewed I don't agree brother Branham don't agree so it's all right whether you agree or not that's alright I'm just telling you that's not the way it goes all right but listen okay he's bragging on wouldn't it be something to realize that God would send this letter to me and you say I know that works my labor not patience and said look you can't bar them with your evil now remember in here in Europe you brother Brennan said the Christian life in the church in Ephesus was not like it is today he said it was based upon the Word of God right now look and that's tried them which say they are apostles how do you try somebody says their apostle prophet tells you in the church in Syria he said you try and by the word well who gives you a right to try anybody ain't trying to just quote the word you don't have to worry about it it's quote the word you don't have to argue and nobody or whatever you know somebody comes down and said well we believe this here so where's it in the word or did the Prophet say that yeah because you're trying the Apostles and proving it wrong and or not and has found them liars who's a liar according to the scripture the liar is he that denied that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh he's an antichrist the denies that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh not was or are is right now in this flesh all right now look he goes on to verse three and hath born and that's patience and for my name's sake labored and hath not find it no look how wonderful God feels about his church I want you to read that for each church age as you read it because you'll find the first verse of each church age or the second verse these church age will be an automatic praise of God they don't matter what agent it is there's be a praise from God but then he has to face reality and then he has to rebuke why because we're guilty so look verse four pulling on that nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love now the Prophet said leaving the first love was the church leaving the Word of God yeah but I swear I think it's just the false vine that left the word well if it's a false vine that left the word and not rebuking the true vine worth any salvation for the truth they don't need it is that what you're saying as you're saying that the true vine don't need no salvation don't need no deliver it says don't lead no is that what you're saying come on folks wake up and get a reality about it no we didn't whip our kids just because we we know that with mom and Daddy is when they needed it right then that's when they got it was when they needed it not just because I was dad here it's when they need it but remember chastening had always been with one thing do you explain this one to me how can he chasing with nail scars in his hand I love that one that's always been something in my heart about that little point because if he's got nail prints in his hands that was hurting how can he spank you hard that you get what I'm saying listen nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love now I've got a rebuke because of what you've done alright remember therefore from whence thou art fallen now if it wouldn't the true bride then what are you gonna do with falling it would be no fall into it right so just forget all of that somebody call himself I think it was the false vine that went away and the true we know the folks Brian went away but the true vine did too I know I've had this problem with people that believed it and tried to present it here then brother Branham said that the church made her worst mistake when they went to Nicaea he said they had no right of going down there we'll see people thanks well it wasn't a true pride that went there well then water down there far why was they doing why are you going to rebuke oh yeah okay you know remember that fall from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works and what's the first works a better way to say that do the first word get back to the word right or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent now if it wasn't a true one that went off and whose get it alright listen then watch him what he starts back the other way now come owner you followed my point and then follow it through these church age first is a praise for what they are what they've done and how they stayed with the Word of God how they've been through all of these things then he'll rebuke them in that age for what they've done but then he starts right back to praising remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent do the first works over or else I'll come unto thee quickly and move that candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which also hate now what about he just rebuked them for falling away from the word because that was the point who was doing was falling away from the word now he's praising them because they have some things right you know God he's mindful of all of our things he knows what we're doing but he knows why we do it he bears with us but this thou hast that I hate us the deeds of the Nicolaitans which all shall hate now what's the naiton atlanteans conquer the laity now you tell me that don't fit today I'm gonna laugh in your face if you don't think this message preachers is doing that now I'm telling you that's a good joke right oh there's always been that conquer the lay it to you right listen but look what he gets to he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches all of them churches plural not just one all them both true and false and for every age same thing to him that overcometh how do we overcome by being in Jesus Christ let me put it this way by realizing he is praised and proud of his people but sometimes he has to rebuke right are you that way were your children you're proud of them very proud of what they're doing and the ways they are with sometimes you got to rebuke but I like the rest of it with all long-suffering and doctrine I always miss the point when most of preachers was hammering us to death back Gardner sixties and no like that in seventies is beating us for everything he moved you know and but what I wanted him to do was rebuke me with doctrine cuz that's what the Bible says reprove rebuke all long-suffering and doctrine you realize by preaching the truth to people you're first off you're gonna make them mad don't grin or laugh at me and say that I'm wrong just swallow and say Amen first thing you're gonna do when you get rebuked is get mad maybe not fightin mad right just close because you're upset hey I'm talking about me that's what I'm talking about you but it's nice sometimes to say something and you look at people and go there's they're grinning anyway you say oh I just said something that didn't go over right Danny quit smiling started frowning so I gotta find out what he's upset about right come on pull it back up now - what did hit watch this because what's the point first here abuse I mean first he he he praises next he rebukes then he comes right back to praising remember this is his children he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God a per taker of the word of God each age we will relate to that point each overcomer gets the revelation of the Word of God you just think where you come from not just saying let's be sensual just think where you come from you know I mean you come from Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pinnacle's whatever our brand of minds after getting the message and just think of what God has been doing for you and me but he expects us to be a little overcome you know overcomer to me now now listen to my explanation so I know what it means there's no one to just give you the definition we can't overcome it's him overcoming in us but you know what we've got to make ourselves available right now here is an overcomer one who comes in here and never ends till he gets here now that's an overcomer right but the most wonderful thing I could think of is the fact of what I've tried to say and we'll keep saying it over and over you may get tired of hearing me State thing but keep listening John I want you to know who I am what we start on anything because I want you to know who's dealing with you who's talking with you who's doing these things and I want you to know I'm the only one that can do what I'm gonna do I'm gonna praise you then I'm gonna rebuke you and then I'm gonna honor that by coming to giving you one of mine let's see how if I quoted the Prophet I'll read it later he said ever church age has a right to part of the deity of Jesus Christ one exists even a Sevenfold glorious person you know think about it he rebukes as I said wanna go with nail-scarred hands he don't throw us out the door now he forgives us but do we forgive each other come on what is that - the overcomer I will grant eat of the Tree of Life now listen to this statement letter Brennan said whatever each overcomer of the age gets the next church age gets that Plus thirst the third church age gets the same as the first church age but with the second age and the Nexus you see where we're standing you see where we stand we get every one of them why because we're the lies we're the ones to carry the burden in the heat of the day and the problem we're the ones that everybody is dependent upon because without us they can't be made perfect I'll find that but it's remember whatever this age gets the next age gets an overcomer promise and that he just gets that right along with it in the next age gets theirs and you just get that right along with it what about when it comes for the rate of our age we get whatever one of them back that we can read that that have to write to the Tree of Life we can read that and know that's going to come to me in this age because as I said this is the age where time and eternity is going to meet know that when I get into that I think about this profit is where he came then why came the way it did tore this profit stands at a most wonderful position because he brings all the word what are you listening pull it back up and let's get to life's part now to him that overcometh so what's the first praising them for the things that they've done and how they've stood with the word and done what they've done in a horrible situation read it read of those things back guard it was taking place but then what does it do and it's that he that excuse come at ya and under there he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God he's going to give us a revelation of his deity read you second sir change you see what you get and remember you get everyone a third Church age for church age field Church a seventh church aging hurts everything what a wonderful God we serve so what about thinking of it because there he stands I had him to bring but I got where I'll get away from all that now on seeming like try to just talk to you John saw one locking the son of man standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks brother run City showed him in his glorified state now he he's glorified he glorifies me and you but remember by him coming in you you're glorifying him well how can we glorify by walking in the word I just seeing what the word says about us and if you don't catch nothing else out of the whole thing the whole series catch this before he ever starts to book of revelations he tells you how perfect everything is it shows you perfect let's see if we still to fall back what but we're not perfect our perfection comes to Jesus Christ the only way we can never be perfect to be in Jesus Christ it didn't come through what we do or don't do but could you think about it that before he tells anything of the church agent he tells you how perfect the church ages are and to prove that's right that my points right you read every Church age and you get home and see if he didn't start off ever Church age with a praise he doesn't wait until it's over with and then prays he praises because he he knows the beginning in the ending he knows what we're gonna do he knew how long we'd be here after the Prophet left he's not worried about it right and what's he doing waiting on me and you to realize what he has already done not what he's going to do oh one of these days that we're Daniel when he David he no no no no he's already done here but don't forget now I will repeat it and I'll repeat it every service he tells the church how perfect it is for he ever starts telling the church ages anything about them then he takes these church age and he praises them he rebukes them and he doesn't lose a one because he comes right to the overcomer and gets everything straight what do we got to worry about while we worried why is it a problem why we why are we worried about the age and the time and what's doing you can't do nothing about it anyway you doesn't hurt the profits it adjourn Abraham Lincoln never office or something like that in the country can't pull this thing out yeah with brother Dale you make it look like it's dude ha did you there's a whole lot more I can read to about the profit and what he said you know if you won't dad I just try my best to get you to see what he thinks of you well brother Dale what does God think of me he thinks you're perfect because that's what he made you and see he's always been that come over there he's always been there he's always there but he tells us before we ever start the book is already written they will be a bride in glory because the Bible says it well all we gotta do is believe we're part of it and then for heaven's sake to be one thing that was trying to explain in there the reason Israel was down there 30 years was because of them not because of God it was their stubbornness it put him there that extra 30 years you know what God kept his word that's thing that were yeah he was there all the time you know that song anybody can you get that song I'd love for us to sing a wrong thank you I don't know what phase number D if we don't have to be in a key when you start off from zero Oh Stan he was that Epis waiting pain he was tough oh he's never gonna leave us he was dead oh the time he was there oh I'll never leave you nor forsake you look at that dark ages than when it struck a downer that they kill those Christians but he was wrapped up he was that is one more of the course made aware something he was there all the time he was there [Music] little buddy Sandberg [Music] amen and Oh anybody have a name just remember he's never left us [Music] we just see that once your church ages is talking praise rebuke can come back brought to reality [Music] Oh [Music] time Ernest he was the the time [Music] waiting patiently [Music] Oh he was heard the time he was the [Music] the time waiting patient [Music] Oh [Music] he was the the time he was there the town waiting pain thank you Jesus [Music] Oh he was that Oh but when we thought he was ever worried that he was the rat when we wondered were you that you write down with us he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you [Music] cause he promised [Music] Oh good father we thank you to know that you was there all the time they don't make no difference what we have and that's for you or do you would already know her to give it to us because you knew what we'd be and what we'd be doing this state the thoughts we try to bring so you were there all the time just waiting patiently for us to move out of the way in ourselves and realize what you've said is true the father we pray that what we've tried to say tonight because only by you being there could it be made perfect our perfection doesn't come to ourselves and what we are it comes through you and you promised it how much safer is us trying to bring out there the other night how much safer is it to be in the arms of our Lord and Savior then it would be to have the whole world bar standing around us try to protect us it would be nothing like what would be if used our and we realized Lord there were none of us are worthy for you to father to even think about what we would speak yet you said it and we believe it we thank you we love in Jesus remember this I mean Sunday brother Vernon will be with us and pray at the Lord with blessing I mean you're dismissed [Music] waiting pay [Music] you [Music]
