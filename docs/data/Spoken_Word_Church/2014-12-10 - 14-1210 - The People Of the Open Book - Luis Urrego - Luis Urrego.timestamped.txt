[7:45] i want to keep you standing here too
[7:47] much longer let me uh let's go ahead to
[7:49] the scriptures to john chapter eight
[7:52] john chapter eight i was having
[7:56] i was having a little trouble putting
[7:57] these these things on
[7:59] and then uh i saw for the dale you know
[8:02] sort of
[8:02] pointing over there to get this thing on
[8:05] and i don't know how he knew that i
[8:07] didn't have him on
[8:09] because then for the wade came back
[8:10] there i said brother wade i'm either
[8:12] gonna have to use
[8:12] just a handheld mic or you help me put
[8:14] this thing on and he helped me put it on
[8:17] so
[8:17] so i appreciate that amen um
[8:21] john chapter 8 verse 21 let's start at
[8:23] verse 21.
[8:27] amen it says then said jesus again unto
[8:30] them
[8:30] i go my way and ye shall seek me and
[8:33] shall die in your sins
[8:35] whether i go ye cannot come then said
[8:38] the jews
[8:39] will he kill himself because he saith
[8:42] whether i go
[8:43] you cannot come and he said unto them ye
[8:46] are
[8:47] from beneath and i am from above
[8:50] ye are of this world i am not of this
[8:53] world
[8:54] right because people of this world amen
[8:55] they think that
[8:57] in that carnal way amen we have we
[9:00] thought
[9:00] in the incarnal way at a point in time
[9:02] amen so jesus came in and and
[9:04] gave us his mind amen we thought we
[9:07] thought carnally
[9:08] amen you are from beneath and i am from
[9:10] modab
[9:11] above you are of this world i am not of
[9:13] this world said
[9:14] i said therefore unto you that ye shall
[9:17] die in your sins
[9:18] for if ye believe not that i am he ye
[9:21] shall die
[9:22] in your sins then said they unto him who
[9:25] art thou
[9:26] and jesus said unto them even the saying
[9:28] that i said unto you
[9:30] from the beginning i have many things to
[9:33] say
[9:33] and to judge of you but he that sent me
[9:36] is true and i speak to the world those
[9:39] things which i have heard of him
[9:42] they understood not that he spake to
[9:44] them of the father
[9:46] then said jesus unto them when ye have
[9:48] lifted up the son of
[9:50] man then shall ye know that i am he
[9:53] and that i do nothing of myself but as
[9:55] my father hath taught me
[9:57] i speak these things amen and i believe
[9:59] that that's how the bride of jesus
[10:01] christ works as well
[10:02] amen they will not do anything outside
[10:04] of this word amen
[10:07] verse 29 and he that sent me is with me
[10:10] the father hath not
[10:11] have not left me alone for i do always
[10:14] those things that please him
[10:16] as he spake these words many believed on
[10:19] him
[10:19] don't you pay attention to that many
[10:21] believed on him
[10:22] but was that enough because jesus
[10:25] immediately tells him then
[10:26] said jesus to those jews which believed
[10:29] on him
[10:30] if ye continue in my word then are ye my
[10:33] disciples indeed
[10:35] and ye shall know the truth and the
[10:37] truth shall make you free
[10:39] praise god amen let's just bow our heads
[10:41] for the word prayer tonight
[10:43] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[10:44] this opportunity that you've given us
[10:46] lord to be gathered together lord
[10:48] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[10:50] will pray now father that you would have
[10:52] your way
[10:52] lord hear in the service speak to our
[10:54] hearts let us receive something from you
[10:56] father god and let us hear lord leave
[10:59] here lord edified and you glorified lord
[11:01] and let us just have something lord to
[11:03] be drawn closer to you father this
[11:05] evening
[11:06] we love you and we commit this time into
[11:08] your hands in the name of the lord jesus
[11:09] christ
[11:10] amen amen praise the lord you may be
[11:12] seated tonight
[11:14] amen
[11:17] praise god amen
[11:22] maybe i'll give a little title to this
[11:23] little thought amen the people of the
[11:25] open book
[11:26] the people of the open book i believe
[11:29] there is a people god has a people here
[11:31] on this earth amen
[11:33] who read amen from an open book
[11:37] amen who receive from an open book it's
[11:39] not a close book now to the bride of
[11:41] christ
[11:42] amen now you might be uh you might be in
[11:45] different levels as
[11:46] and the statue of a perfect man amen but
[11:49] i believe that as you're growing amen
[11:50] that book
[11:51] that book is being revealed and opened
[11:53] up to you even more and more
[11:54] praise god now even faith is a
[11:57] revelation
[11:58] amen so even when you start down at the
[12:00] bottom that's a revelation to you that's
[12:01] the book opening up to you amen
[12:04] and how what i want to get to tonight
[12:06] amen is
[12:07] and i've just been ever since you know
[12:09] we've been uh coming to the church
[12:11] and uh i just maybe get kind of a little
[12:13] bit personal
[12:14] i really appreciate the ministry here
[12:16] and i really appreciate
[12:17] amen the uh the uh the the the the
[12:20] uh the time and the effort that god that
[12:24] is involved amen and going into the word
[12:26] amen
[12:27] i certainly i certainly needed that and
[12:30] uh
[12:30] i could say in the last three four
[12:32] months amen i've been growing
[12:34] amen a lot and i just thank the lord for
[12:36] that amen because
[12:38] um you know you you you even even in the
[12:42] in the ranks of the message you know
[12:44] you're still out there and
[12:45] uh you think things of a certain way
[12:47] amen but when when you look at when you
[12:48] look at things amen in the word amen you
[12:51] see how they are amen
[12:52] going to make you think amen what was i
[12:55] believing
[12:57] amen so i just appreciate amen brother
[13:00] dale in the ministry here and
[13:01] brother wade each one of the ministers
[13:03] here man and
[13:04] so i just ask that you all continue to
[13:06] remember brother brother dale and
[13:07] brother wade all these ministers amen in
[13:09] prayer amen
[13:10] that the lord will just use them amen to
[13:12] continue bringing them by bringing us
[13:14] that word amen
[13:16] praise god so so
[13:20] we um we are people of an open book
[13:22] tonight amen and i like what jesus said
[13:24] here
[13:26] in verse 31 if we read it again it says
[13:28] then said jesus to those jews which
[13:30] believed on him
[13:32] if you continue in my word then are ye
[13:34] my disciples indeed right
[13:36] now i want you to notice amen that the
[13:38] disciples the 12 apostles at one point
[13:41] in time he had 70
[13:42] 70 disciples they were with him amen
[13:45] and and when he started breaking forth
[13:48] that word amen
[13:50] a lot of them when he started describing
[13:53] if you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[13:55] you have no part of me they couldn't
[13:56] understand what he was talking about
[13:58] and so all of a sudden the bible tells
[14:00] us that they started walking away
[14:03] why because they couldn't understand
[14:04] they could that they could not receive
[14:06] that was too hard for them to receive
[14:08] amen
[14:08] then he turns over to the disciples and
[14:10] he says are you going to go away also
[14:12] right and he said and and of course we
[14:14] know that the great words of peter amen
[14:16] when he said
[14:17] where shall we go you are the only one
[14:19] who has the words of eternal life
[14:21] amen and i believe amen that we serve a
[14:24] god who has the words of eternal life
[14:26] tonight
[14:27] and has a word specifically just for you
[14:30] amen
[14:32] and so when peter said that amen
[14:35] when he said that he said we know that
[14:38] our the christ
[14:39] amen and judas was standing right there
[14:41] amongst him
[14:42] right so he was including judas right
[14:45] there with
[14:45] him amen as we know that you are the
[14:48] christ the son of the living god
[14:50] and what does what does jesus
[14:52] immediately tell them
[14:55] he tells them amen have i not chosen you
[14:58] 12
[14:58] and one of you don't just have a devil
[15:01] but one of you is a devil
[15:04] one of them then just to have the devil
[15:06] he said but one of you is a devil
[15:08] amen and him knowing who the christ
[15:12] was him knowing who jesus was right
[15:14] there
[15:15] that we know we know that you are the
[15:17] one that come from god we know we
[15:19] believe you
[15:20] amen and and judas was able to cast out
[15:23] devils
[15:24] healed the sick and do all these things
[15:27] just exactly like the disciples
[15:28] because god had jesus had given him
[15:30] power a man to do these things back in
[15:32] matthew 10.
[15:34] but yet even after they believe amen
[15:38] judas could not continue with that word
[15:40] right
[15:41] and this is this is exactly amen what
[15:43] jesus is telling them here
[15:44] then said jesus to those jews which
[15:46] believed on him
[15:48] amen if ye continue in my word then
[15:52] are ye my disciples indeed
[15:55] amen like i said before amen there's a
[15:56] part that you must do as well
[15:59] you must get into the word of god amen
[16:03] you must amen uh reverence the word of
[16:05] god amen
[16:06] be into this word amen uh day and night
[16:09] amen why because we are the people of
[16:12] the open book
[16:13] i mean we should be excited as the bride
[16:15] of christ amen to have amen
[16:17] this word revealed unto us amen
[16:20] for us not to be able not not to uh
[16:23] not to uh uh look into the scriptures
[16:25] and and study and and do what we need to
[16:28] do amen
[16:30] because i tell you what amen uh we we we
[16:33] can get
[16:33] we can get so lazy and so relaxed in
[16:36] this day and time
[16:37] right i've said it before amen
[16:40] people have come to the point amen where
[16:42] they just put this thing on cruise
[16:43] control
[16:45] and they said well you know the the the
[16:48] the
[16:48] one day there's gonna be a resurrection
[16:50] i'll just be part of it and
[16:52] uh and then the lord will come amen and
[16:54] and and you'll just
[16:56] you'll just be riding on cruise control
[16:58] somewhere or another the lord will put
[16:59] will
[17:00] will put me in into that economy some
[17:03] way or another
[17:04] amen but you have to me man you have to
[17:08] uh uh uh be part of this of this amen
[17:11] you have to put your part into it as
[17:13] well
[17:13] amen because god's not gonna give you
[17:15] anything that you don't want
[17:18] god's not going to give you anything
[17:20] amen that you don't ask for
[17:22] exactly god's not going to give you
[17:23] anything amen that you don't you don't
[17:25] you don't cry out for
[17:26] amen what did the children of israel
[17:29] amen when they were in
[17:29] egypt it was when they a man cried out
[17:32] amen
[17:33] god said i heard their cries amen when
[17:35] they got to a desperate position in
[17:37] their life amen
[17:38] well we can't take it anymore lord you
[17:40] promised us something
[17:41] amen and now we're ready to receive it
[17:44] and that's when god came on the scene
[17:45] amen exactly right
[17:47] praise god and that's how we're going to
[17:48] amen we're going to receive from god
[17:50] until we get to that point amen that the
[17:53] word is so precious unto us
[17:55] and just how we're going to read in just
[17:57] a little bit
[17:59] how when the children of israel amen
[18:00] when they were in babylon and they came
[18:02] back
[18:03] they had forgotten a lot about the word
[18:04] of god amen and we're going to read that
[18:07] here in just a moment i want to get
[18:08] ahead of myself
[18:10] praise god but if you continue in my
[18:12] word then are you my disciples indeed
[18:14] and ye shall know the truth
[18:16] and the truth shall make you free amen
[18:18] amen well i thought when we first come
[18:20] into the message we know the truth
[18:23] when you believe that serpent seed and
[18:24] when you believe that that that the
[18:26] baptism in the name of lord jesus christ
[18:28] and all those things you you were in the
[18:30] truth praise god i'm in the message
[18:32] i know the truth amen amen but as if you
[18:35] continue in my word amen
[18:37] because many people you know many people
[18:39] now amen they believe this this message
[18:42] amen but they only believed it with
[18:43] their head right they had their
[18:45] their head turned amen but they didn't
[18:47] have their heart turned
[18:48] right and that's two different things
[18:51] amen amen
[18:52] what did malachi 4 come to do amen to
[18:54] turn the hearts of the children back
[18:56] to the faith of the fathers amen
[18:59] and so we trust amen that that is that
[19:01] is each and every one of us amen that
[19:03] we've had
[19:03] not just our heads turned to have a
[19:06] bunch of head knowledge amen
[19:08] right to debate amen whether this is
[19:10] right or not amen
[19:11] amen but to have that word amen so in in
[19:14] in us amen that it it'll change us amen
[19:17] as we're living day to day amen this
[19:19] word should change us praise god
[19:21] amen praise the lord so
[19:25] and you shall know the truth and the
[19:26] truth shall make you free amen amen
[19:29] how much freedom amen as you're growing
[19:31] in christ amen
[19:33] and you're growing in christ how much
[19:34] freedom it is amen to one day
[19:36] man have that body change amen amen
[19:40] and that that you can have that revealed
[19:42] amen to you amen even before it actually
[19:44] takes place amen
[19:46] praise god and can't only do that unless
[19:48] you're in the word
[19:49] praise the lord amen so i appreciate god
[19:53] and i appreciate amen
[19:54] uh what he's doing in each and every one
[19:56] of our lives amen amen
[19:58] now we're going to do we're going to do
[19:59] have here just a little bit a little
[20:01] little quiz here for just a moment so

[20:27] i want to do this for for a reason i
[20:29] want you to tell me i'm going to ask you
[20:30] all a series of questions and if you
[20:32] want to
[20:33] whoever wants to answer them quickly go
[20:35] ahead and answer okay
[20:38] who was thrown into a den of lions
[20:42] everybody knows this daniel your little
[20:44] kids know that amen
[20:46] question number two what what in the
[20:48] bible when it says
[20:50] it says what what is the beginning of
[20:52] wisdom
[20:57] the fear of the lord amen amen question
[21:00] number three says which
[21:01] angel appeared to mary
[21:04] gabriel question four which two people
[21:08] walked on water
[21:13] peter and jesus another question what
[21:15] was christ's
[21:16] first miracle
[21:20] turning that water into wine amen a
[21:23] couple more questions who had a coat of
[21:25] many colors
[21:27] joseph how many books are there in the
[21:30] entire bible
[21:32] amen you guys are smart
[21:36] whose tomb was christ buried in
[21:39] amen joseph of arimathea that's right
[21:43] two more questions how many people were
[21:44] in noah's ark
[21:47] eight people that's a good number
[21:51] number eternity ten what is the golden
[21:56] rule
[22:00] now for a long time i used to hear that
[22:02] and i thought that was just a a a
[22:04] a saying of man but actually that's in
[22:06] matthew 10 7 12
[22:08] right amen he just says do unto others
[22:11] do
[22:11] to others what you want them to do to
[22:13] you amen praise god
[22:16] so uh i see that you all are very smart
[22:19] and that you all know some at least at
[22:21] least those 10 questions of the word
[22:24] amen
[22:26] least that amen most people can probably
[22:29] can probably answer those questions amen
[22:32] but i want to
[22:33] i want you to know amen that
[22:36] doing bible quizzes and doing knowing
[22:39] just
[22:39] the the the the word amen in that in
[22:42] that way amen
[22:43] does not guarantee or does not amen to
[22:46] say that that you have the word inside
[22:47] of you
[22:48] amen just because you carry a bible in
[22:51] your hand amen
[22:52] does not guarantee amen that you're
[22:54] living a life with christ
[22:55] amen because i tell you what a lot of
[22:58] people in the world
[22:59] in the in the world who went to sunday
[23:01] school when they were little kids
[23:02] could probably answer those questions
[23:05] but that does not guarantee
[23:06] you have a personal relationship with
[23:08] christ that does not prove amen that
[23:11] christ is dwelling within you amen
[23:12] and that the holy spirit has taken over
[23:14] amen
[23:16] that does not guarantee that one bit
[23:18] that's just head knowledge
[23:20] and i'm afraid that that's exactly amen
[23:22] what a lot of people in this message
[23:23] have
[23:24] right just a bunch of head knowledge i'm
[23:26] convinced of that
[23:28] right amen but how important it is amen
[23:31] as jesus said amen to continue
[23:33] in the truth continue in my word amen
[23:36] continuing in my word is not just
[23:38] memorizing little quizzes like this
[23:41] amen or little trivia amen
[23:44] but it's amen finding yourself in the
[23:46] scriptures amen
[23:48] finding the person of jesus christ amen
[23:50] in the word amen and as you as your
[23:52] as you want to know more about him amen
[23:54] you're finding yourself more in the word
[23:56] praise god amen and and i remember when
[24:00] i first come into the uh
[24:01] coming to this word amen and uh and god
[24:05] from a from a young from a young age at
[24:08] 12 years old
[24:10] you know i was i was uh i was reading uh
[24:12] jehovah's witness books
[24:14] you know because at the time we were
[24:16] jehovah's witnesses and
[24:17] i would sit there and read the
[24:19] watchtower magazine and all those things
[24:21] now how many how many kids are 10 11 12
[24:24] years old you see them reading things
[24:25] like that
[24:27] but i didn't know it was just god amen
[24:29] just calling just just drawing me does
[24:31] something
[24:32] wanted me to want something in me wanted
[24:34] to
[24:35] know more about the bible and so i would
[24:37] lay down amen when some of the kids were
[24:40] in there playing video games and things
[24:41] like that
[24:42] i was just laying down on the couch amen
[24:44] reading a tower magazine
[24:46] don't get me wrong i used to play video
[24:48] games and all those things as well
[24:50] amen but and then god amen
[24:53] uh when we when we switched over from
[24:56] the jehovah's witness to the baptist
[24:57] church
[24:58] i mean i came to that realization that i
[25:00] needed salvation in my life
[25:02] and that's when i accepted the lord
[25:04] jesus as my savior
[25:05] amen and from there we started growing
[25:09] amen
[25:10] and and and it's just god amen just
[25:12] leading you through amen
[25:15] and you don't understand how how it
[25:17] works from one
[25:18] from one point to another amen and all
[25:20] of a sudden amen
[25:22] you come to realize amen that uh
[25:25] that the word has been opened amen and
[25:28] and then
[25:29] in 1999 when i went to columbia south
[25:32] america amen
[25:34] there was a cousin of my mother there
[25:36] who who had
[25:37] who had knowed the message and he
[25:40] started telling us about the message
[25:41] amen and he started telling us about
[25:43] these things amen there and
[25:45] god sent a prophet and all these things
[25:47] and of course to us as
[25:49] the baptist at the time we thought it
[25:51] was strange
[25:52] but you know for for us amen we didn't
[25:55] we didn't reject the stuff
[25:57] until we we came in and searched it out
[25:59] ourselves right
[26:00] and i'm so i'm i'm thankful amen that
[26:03] even the pastor down there in
[26:04] in colombia he he told us he said i
[26:07] can't let you all go back to the united
[26:08] states until i let
[26:10] you uh tell you about these things
[26:13] so i appreciate the lord and i thank god
[26:15] for doing that amen
[26:18] but um and so
[26:21] you you have all these things and you
[26:22] realize well all these all these truths
[26:24] are in the word amen
[26:26] but then all of a sudden amen it comes a
[26:28] point in your life amen where you can
[26:30] have all these things in your head
[26:31] amen but you're real you're wondering
[26:33] why is my life amen why is my christian
[26:35] life amen so
[26:36] so so damn amen why is my christian why
[26:39] am i not progressing with christ
[26:40] i know the truth i know i know these
[26:44] revelations these great things amen
[26:46] and you and you wonder and you think
[26:48] amen why is it
[26:50] well it's because amen sometimes we
[26:52] slack amen we slack on staying in the
[26:54] word amen
[26:55] and reading what and reading and and
[26:57] praying the way we should
[26:58] and i'll be the first one to raise my
[27:00] hands amen
[27:01] i believe we need more of that amen i
[27:04] believe we need
[27:05] amen more uh uh uh uh um
[27:10] it should it should it should sadden us
[27:12] amen to think amen that we don't have
[27:14] that we go one day without reading the
[27:16] word
[27:18] it should sadden us amen that we can go
[27:20] amen
[27:21] some of us can go amen a whole week amen
[27:23] not going to church
[27:26] sadden us to go one whole week and not
[27:28] reading the word amen
[27:30] the bride of christ desires amen that
[27:32] word because that's the only thing that
[27:34] the soul can feed upon
[27:36] amen praise the lord so i just
[27:38] appreciate the lord for that amen so
[27:40] doing these bible quizzes and all these
[27:42] things don't prove amen that the word is
[27:44] dwelling in you
[27:45] amen exactly it's just dwelling in here
[27:48] but not in you amen to change you amen
[27:52] i was looking at um i was looking at a
[27:55] uh
[27:57] at a census at a
[28:01] it was it was a group called the barna
[28:03] group amen
[28:04] they released the results of a survey
[28:07] they commissioned
[28:08] by the american bible society called
[28:11] the state of the bible six trends for
[28:14] 2014.
[28:16] this was done earlier this year and
[28:19] it's it's pretty amazing amen how the
[28:22] decline of the people here in the united
[28:23] states
[28:24] as a whole have no reverence for the
[28:27] scriptures whatsoever
[28:29] i'm just going to read you just a few
[28:30] things here amen um
[28:33] one of them was that bible skepticism is
[28:35] now tied with
[28:36] bible engagement amen this year's
[28:40] i'll just read this is this year's
[28:42] research reveals that skepticism towards
[28:44] the bible continues to rise
[28:47] for the first time since tracking began
[28:50] bible skepticism is tied with
[28:52] bible engagement the number of those who
[28:55] are skeptical or agnostic toward the
[28:57] bible who believe
[28:58] that the bible is just another book of
[29:00] teachings
[29:01] written by man that contains stories and
[29:03] advice
[29:04] has nearly doubled from 10 percent to 19
[29:06] percent
[29:07] of the population of the united states
[29:10] in just three years
[29:12] in just three years this is now equal to
[29:14] the number of people who are bible
[29:16] engaged
[29:17] who read the bible at least four times a
[29:19] week and believe it is the actual or
[29:21] inspired word of god
[29:24] and um another thing that was
[29:26] interesting that people are less
[29:28] likely to view the bible as sacred
[29:31] in 2011 11 it was 86 now in 2014
[29:35] 79 bible ownership remains strong
[29:39] but readership remains weak i was
[29:42] shocked at this
[29:43] and and and i know this is the truth
[29:45] because
[29:47] in my household i have i have these many
[29:50] i'll just read this here 88 of household
[29:53] on a bible here in america
[29:56] 88 and uh the average number of bibles
[30:00] per household is 4.7
[30:02] it's almost five bibles per household
[30:05] amen
[30:06] but 37 percent of americans read it once
[30:08] a week or more
[30:12] and some of us they may have 10 or more
[30:15] we have them in our in our phones and
[30:18] everything now and we still don't read
[30:20] them we take them with us
[30:23] everywhere we go and we still don't
[30:24] engage in the word right
[30:26] with shame on us amen 56
[30:30] of americans they remain pro-bible
[30:34] uh this is people who believe the bible
[30:37] is the actual or inspired word of god
[30:39] uh with no errors amen so it's still 56
[30:41] percent of people
[30:43] um one of the things that that that that
[30:47] seems to be
[30:48] causing the people to read the bible
[30:49] less is distraction
[30:51] and vision business uh is what's causing
[30:55] the people to read the bible less
[30:57] it says what keeps the people from
[30:58] reading the bible they own
[31:00] like all other forms of an analog media
[31:03] the bible is pushed to the side in part
[31:05] because people are just too busy
[31:08] too busy to read the word amen when
[31:11] when there was people amen that died for
[31:13] this word at one point in time
[31:15] people that died amen for this we're
[31:18] trying to translate the scriptures amen
[31:20] into other languages
[31:22] um i know that even in
[31:25] in in south america and colombia where
[31:28] i'm from they don't even have all the
[31:29] messages
[31:30] that brother branham preached amen they
[31:33] only have
[31:34] maybe about three or four hundred of
[31:35] them or so
[31:37] and uh they treasure those messages
[31:39] right amen
[31:40] well you know we ride in the car and
[31:42] then we have them sitting in between our
[31:44] couch seats and uh
[31:46] tapes laying under our bed and things
[31:47] like that and and
[31:49] we don't think anything of it but i tell
[31:51] people overseas amen
[31:53] they treasure these things amen they
[31:56] treasure this word
[31:57] amen again is shame on us
[32:01] i include myself in that because here in
[32:03] america we're just spoiled
[32:06] i just put it the way it is we're
[32:07] spoiled we're spoiled physically
[32:09] we're spoiled spiritually as well as far
[32:12] as far as
[32:13] you know this word there's no excuse
[32:15] amen we have no excuse whatsoever
[32:18] among those who say the their bible
[32:20] reading decreased in the last year the
[32:22] number one reason was busyness
[32:24] 40 report being too busy with life's
[32:27] responsibilities
[32:28] job family etcetera an increase of seven
[32:31] points from just one year ago
[32:35] other factors americans cite as reasons
[32:37] for less time reading scripture include
[32:39] a significant change in their life
[32:41] seventeen percent becoming atheist or
[32:43] agnostic
[32:44] and we're seeing that a lot more and
[32:45] more right people just saying forget
[32:47] about it
[32:48] there's no god but they don't understand
[32:50] that they have a soul within them
[32:52] they're gonna have to answer for one day
[32:54] anyways
[32:54] you can say you don't have god in your
[32:56] heart all you all you want
[32:58] there's no god but there's a soul in you
[33:01] still
[33:02] that you're going to have to answer for
[33:03] exactly right
[33:05] becoming atheist or agnostic 15 going
[33:08] through
[33:08] a difficult experience that caused them
[33:10] to doubt god
[33:11] 13 and seeing that reading the bible
[33:14] made very little difference in someone
[33:15] else's life
[33:19] most people still come to the bible to
[33:20] find intimacy with god but increasingly
[33:23] more people come looking for just
[33:24] answers to life's questions
[33:28] again that's what people want they just
[33:29] want quizzes right
[33:31] they just want trivia amen out of the
[33:34] out of the bible
[33:35] amen even i think it was last year uh
[33:38] this jeff foxworthy came out with a show
[33:40] something about uh uh some bible trivia
[33:44] and it was it was a nationally known
[33:46] show yeah
[33:47] i don't know how popular it become but
[33:50] it's becoming popular amen the trivia of
[33:53] tr having knowing knowing the trivia of
[33:55] the bible is is a popular thing
[33:57] now you see a lot of these bible movies
[33:59] that are coming out a lot nowadays you
[34:01] know
[34:03] people that go they watch that and they
[34:05] think wow you know i'm engaged i'm i'm
[34:07] looking at the bible i'm watching
[34:09] i'm watching the bible right amen that
[34:12] doesn't mean you're engaged in the word
[34:13] amen
[34:15] i'm almost done here in 2011 64
[34:19] said that the bible brings me closer to
[34:21] god
[34:23] and in 2014 56
[34:26] say that now the bible brings me comfort
[34:29] or helps solve my problems
[34:32] 26 percent said that in 2011 and that's
[34:35] now increased to 32 percent
[34:38] so again showing that people amen all
[34:40] they want is just trivia
[34:41] right they want th they just want that
[34:43] answer that quick answer to life's
[34:45] questions amen
[34:46] it's like god is is a spiritual google
[34:49] you know yeah
[34:51] lord tell me amen about this what did uh
[34:53] uh

[35:13] saints amen because
[35:15] you know i'm getting ready to leave and
[35:17] and i may not have another
[35:19] opportunity to speak until after i come
[35:20] back but
[35:22] starting the new year saints i i i
[35:24] committed myself amen to engage myself
[35:27] in the word
[35:27] even more amen and i trust that you do
[35:30] as well
[35:31] amen because uh this is the only thing
[35:34] that's going to help us get out of here
[35:36] right engage in the word engage in that
[35:38] word amen
[35:39] how am i going to grow in christ amen
[35:41] read the bible in prayer your day
[35:46] that's something that sounds like
[35:47] something very difficult does it
[35:50] that's how it needs to be done and as
[35:52] you enter into that word amen
[35:54] god will reveal yourself to you even
[35:56] more and more
[35:57] amen and i know each one of us know that
[36:00] but it's so easy amen for us to just get
[36:02] sidetracked amen for the things that we
[36:04] need to do
[36:05] that really matter in life we get so
[36:08] sidetracked with well i got to take care
[36:10] of this i got to do this
[36:11] we got to go here we got to go there
[36:13] amen and god is put in a corner
[36:15] somewhere amen and put on a shelf
[36:17] somewhere
[36:18] and and and and when we think about him
[36:21] again amen
[36:23] we've already lost so much amen
[36:26] praise god second timothy 3 16 tells us
[36:30] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[36:33] god
[36:34] all scripture amen i like that and it's
[36:38] profitable for doctrine for reproof
[36:40] for correction for instruction in
[36:42] righteousness
[36:43] why that the man of god may be perfect
[36:47] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[36:50] amen
[36:52] amen thoroughly perfect amen does that
[36:54] mean that you're not going to make a
[36:55] mistake amen
[36:56] uh you'll make mistakes amen you'll fall
[36:59] in this flesh
[37:00] amen amen but you i mean you're you're
[37:03] you're you're heading towards perfection
[37:05] amen
[37:07] praise god thoroughly furnished unto all
[37:09] good works
[37:11] and you know so many times amen people
[37:13] come to us amen you know the only thing
[37:15] that we have amen in common with people
[37:17] out there and denominations and people
[37:19] out in the street
[37:20] is the bible they have no clue what you
[37:22] if you come to them and say brother
[37:24] branham said this and brother brown said
[37:25] that
[37:26] he tried to explain that to somebody out
[37:28] in the in in the mission field that
[37:30] don't know of amen from left to right
[37:32] hand amen
[37:32] the prophet said and amen that's the
[37:36] only thing that you're going to have in
[37:37] common with the people out here is the
[37:38] word
[37:39] and so if we engage less and less in the
[37:41] word amen how are you going to be able
[37:43] to speak to people when they when when
[37:45] when when they ask an answer of you amen
[37:49] that's why the bible says study to show
[37:51] that self-approved amen
[37:54] praise god brother branham says this
[37:56] here now some of you brethren remember
[37:58] in the old testament they had a way of
[38:00] finding out
[38:01] whether a prophet was telling the truth
[38:03] or a dreamer was dreaming right
[38:05] his dream was from god they taken him to
[38:08] the temple where the breastplate of
[38:10] aaron
[38:11] was hanging and it was called yurim
[38:12] thummim many of you people know about it
[38:15] reading in the bible
[38:16] and when this prophet began to prophesy
[38:18] and those supernatural lights didn't
[38:20] register back
[38:21] off of that like a rainbow crossed that
[38:23] making the urim thumb and
[38:25] from that breastplate no matter how real
[38:28] it sound they didn't believe it
[38:30] no surrey had to be answered back by god
[38:33] amen
[38:34] now the old testament was done away with
[38:37] and fulfilled
[38:38] right not done away but fulfilled and
[38:41] when it did
[38:42] we took a new testament now the old urim
[38:45] thumb and was back in the levitical
[38:47] levitical priesthood under aaron's
[38:49] breast amen
[38:50] right but this time we have two
[38:53] more tables of law the new and old
[38:55] testament
[38:57] and that's god's urine thumb to me
[39:00] if god doesn't speak back through his
[39:02] word when we see something
[39:03] then i just leave it alone amen
[39:07] you can have the greatest revelation and
[39:10] it sounds really good amen but if that
[39:12] word is not speaking back to you
[39:13] if you can't place it in the word
[39:15] anywhere amen you better leave that
[39:16] thing alone exactly right amen
[39:18] because it's going to get you in trouble
[39:20] it's going to get you in trouble
[39:22] and it's going to end up confusing you
[39:24] even more
[39:26] and we know that we don't serve a god of
[39:28] confusion
[39:31] if god doesn't speak back through his
[39:33] word when we see something then i just
[39:34] leave it alone
[39:35] but as long as it's it's as it's the
[39:37] word
[39:38] amen then i know that heavens and earth
[39:40] will pass away but his word will never
[39:42] fail
[39:43] therefore i believe the bible to be the
[39:45] absolute truth of god
[39:47] and it isn't to be added to or taken
[39:49] away from
[39:50] what but what but just lived preached in
[39:53] its simplicity
[39:55] amen lived the way it's wrote and god is
[39:58] if he ever was god he's still god and if
[40:01] this is his word
[40:02] and he made a promise that he cannot
[40:04] back up then he isn't god right
[40:06] amen as i said last night amen i could
[40:09] bank my soul amen on this word of god
[40:11] amen amen
[40:12] i don't care how many people are falling
[40:14] like flies amen
[40:16] how many how many big time preachers are
[40:18] fallen amen
[40:19] i will beg my soul amen on this word
[40:22] amen
[40:22] because we know we i believe i serve a
[40:24] god who cannot lie
[40:26] amen and if he's brought me this far
[40:28] amen i know that his word will continue
[40:30] to lead me to amen on
[40:32] praise god amen so
[40:36] let's i want us to all turn to uh and i
[40:38] think they'll just bring it up here real
[40:40] quick
[40:41] nehemiah chapter eight i want you to to
[40:43] look at this
[40:44] story real quick and uh
[40:52] nehemiah chapter 8.
[40:58] this was when after israel had come back
[41:01] from
[41:02] being in babylon and i can't remember
[41:03] how long they were in babylon
[41:05] but they were in babylon for a long time
[41:08] and they had forgotten amen about
[41:10] the a lot of them had forgotten about
[41:11] the traditions and the things that they
[41:13] had that god had given them amen
[41:17] in the word and then starting at verse
[41:19] 1. i just want to take this here
[41:21] just a moment it says and all the people
[41:24] gathered themselves together as one man
[41:26] into the street
[41:27] that was before the watergate and they
[41:30] spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the
[41:32] book
[41:32] of the law of moses which the lord had
[41:35] commanded to israel
[41:36] i want you to notice is that it was the
[41:37] people that was crying out for this
[41:39] exactly right it wasn't ezra they went
[41:41] out amen the bible doesn't say that ezra
[41:43] went out to give it to the people but it
[41:45] was the people
[41:45] asking ezra amen for this amen
[41:51] and verse two and ezra the priest
[41:54] brought the law before the congregation
[41:56] both of man
[41:58] and women and all that could hear with
[42:00] understanding
[42:01] upon the first day of the seven months
[42:04] seventh month
[42:05] and he read therein before the street
[42:07] that was before the watergate
[42:09] from the morning until midday
[42:13] before the man and the women and those
[42:15] that could understand and the ears of
[42:17] all the people were attentive
[42:18] unto the book of the law
[42:22] and i like what it says and the ears of
[42:24] all the people
[42:27] all the people were attentive unto the
[42:30] book of the law
[42:32] so that means that not none of them were
[42:34] sleeping
[42:36] none of them were looking at the time
[42:38] and seeing when ezra was going to stop
[42:40] reading
[42:41] none of them were looking going getting
[42:43] up going to the bathroom in the middle
[42:44] of the reading
[42:45] no no we're doing none of that amen
[42:49] they were very attentive amen unto the
[42:52] book of the law
[42:53] verse 4 and ezra the scribe stood upon a
[42:56] pulpit of wood which they had made for
[42:59] the perp for the purpose
[43:00] and beside him stood mathithaya and
[43:03] shima and ananiyan
[43:04] urja and hilkiah and maisia
[43:08] on his right hand and on his left hand
[43:10] padaya
[43:11] and michel and malkia and hashem and
[43:14] hashbadana and zechariah and michelin
[43:17] and ezra opened the book in the side of
[43:19] all the people
[43:21] for he was above all the people now
[43:24] doesn't mean that he was just he was
[43:25] above but i mean he was standing the
[43:26] pulpit was high so he was standing
[43:28] amen he was above all the people and
[43:30] when he opened it
[43:32] all the people stood up amen
[43:35] now these people amen they had not been
[43:37] with the word with the law for a long
[43:39] long
[43:40] time and they came to a point where they
[43:42] missed that word
[43:45] now you and me get it every single day
[43:48] right you and me get it every single
[43:49] sunday
[43:50] every single wednesday you may get it
[43:52] and we just
[43:57] imagine if god put us in this position
[43:59] amen where we're not hearing amen his
[44:00] word for
[44:01] exactly 500 600 years or whatever the
[44:04] time frame that these people were away
[44:06] from the law
[44:07] amen
[44:10] and ezra opened the book in the sight of
[44:11] all the people he was above all the
[44:13] people and when he opened
[44:14] all the people stood up and ezra blessed
[44:16] the lord the great god
[44:18] and all the people answered amen amen
[44:20] with lifting up their
[44:22] hands and they bowed their heads and
[44:24] worshipped the lord with their faces to
[44:26] the ground
[44:27] right it was a time of worship when that
[44:30] word was opened up
[44:31] amen also jeshua bani and sharabaya
[44:36] jamin
[44:36] akube shabathai hadija messiah khalida
[44:40] azaria
[44:41] joseph hanan pelaya and the levites
[44:43] caused the people
[44:45] to understand the law amen amen
[44:49] so it wasn't just a one-man show
[44:53] it was several people involved and amen
[44:55] to make sure that the people were
[44:57] understanding the law amen amen
[45:00] that's why teaching amen is very
[45:02] important amen
[45:04] exactly right and that's why i
[45:05] appreciate amen and if we have a little
[45:07] time i want to show
[45:08] a little just a little bit about when we
[45:10] went to the philippines last year
[45:11] but you pray for brother wade amen as he
[45:14] heads to the philippines here in just a
[45:15] few months
[45:16] because i believe they will benefit from
[45:18] his ministry amen
[45:20] from that ministry they need a lot of
[45:21] teaching over there
[45:23] amen so you pray for brother wade that
[45:25] the lord is just using
[45:26] amen but just to actually sit there and
[45:28] work with the people amen
[45:30] to make sure that they understand amen
[45:34] caused the people to understand the law
[45:35] and the people stood in their place
[45:38] so they read in the book in the law of
[45:39] god distinctly
[45:41] and gave the sense and caused them to
[45:43] understand the reading
[45:45] verse 9 in nehemiah which is the tishita
[45:47] and ezra the priest the scribe and the
[45:49] levites that taught the people said unto
[45:51] all the people
[45:52] this day is holy unto the lord your god
[45:55] more not
[45:56] nor weep for all the people wept when
[45:59] they heard the words of the law
[46:02] amen they wept amen when this book
[46:06] amen was open to them right when this
[46:08] word amen was opened to them why
[46:10] because there's great things amen it
[46:12] wasn't just the word of a man
[46:14] it was the word of the lord amen and
[46:17] how many of you take that reverence
[46:19] state amen that that
[46:21] when this word when this bible this book
[46:23] is opened amen
[46:24] or even when brother dale comes up here
[46:26] and man brings you the word
[46:28] amen do you take that that state of
[46:30] reverence amen the lord amen
[46:32] i appreciate your word so much i thank
[46:34] you god for the revelation of jesus

[46:37] i thank you amen for sending man amen
[46:39] that can preach the word of god amen and
[46:41] that labor day and night amen just to
[46:43] bring us the word amen
[46:46] praise god something to look forward to
[46:48] in this coming year amen
[46:54] for all the people when they heard the
[46:55] words of the law amen
[46:57] verse 10 then he said unto them go your
[47:00] way eat the fat
[47:01] and drink the sweet and send portions
[47:04] unto them for whom nothing is prepared
[47:06] for this day is holy unto our lord
[47:09] neither be ye sorry for the joy of the
[47:11] lord your strength
[47:12] amen so you take you receive this word
[47:14] amen and you just don't keep it for
[47:16] yourself
[47:17] amen you want to share it with somebody
[47:20] else amen
[47:21] praise god that joy amen the joy that
[47:24] you receive amen when you come
[47:26] around the word of god amen that's why i
[47:28] love bible study
[47:30] i i i appreciate amen in bible studies
[47:33] amen
[47:34] i i i you know it just it just causes
[47:38] amen something in me amen it just
[47:39] excites me amen to be able to hear amen
[47:41] more of the word
[47:42] get get dig into that word amen glory
[47:45] praise god
[47:48] amen why because remember we are the
[47:49] people of the open book
[47:51] right amen this book was open here amen
[47:54] the people were excited about it
[47:56] praise god neither be ye sorry for the
[48:00] joy of the lord is your strength amen
[48:03] so the levites stilled all the people
[48:05] saying hold your peace for the day is
[48:07] holy
[48:08] neither be ye grieved and all the people
[48:10] went their way to eat
[48:11] and to drink and to send portions and to
[48:13] make great mirth
[48:15] because they had understood the words
[48:17] that were declared unto them
[48:19] amen it's exciting amen right the word
[48:22] should excite us
[48:23] and on the second day we gather together
[48:24] the chief of the fathers of all the
[48:26] people the priests and the levites unto
[48:28] ezra
[48:28] describe even to understand the words of
[48:30] the law
[48:32] amen and they found written in the law
[48:34] which the lord had commanded by moses
[48:36] that the children of israel
[48:37] should dwell in booths in the feast of
[48:39] the seventh month so that's
[48:41] going back they realized that the uh the
[48:43] feast of tabernacles amen
[48:45] something that they had forgotten right
[48:48] and that they should publish out and
[48:50] proclaim in all their cities and in
[48:51] jerusalem saying go
[48:52] forth unto the mount and fetch olive
[48:54] branches and pine branches and myrtle
[48:56] branches
[48:57] and palm branches and branches of thick
[48:59] trees to make boots as it is written
[49:01] so the people went forth and brought
[49:02] them and made themselves boots
[49:04] everyone upon the roof of this of his
[49:06] house and in their courts and in the
[49:08] courts of the house of god
[49:09] and in the street of the watergate and
[49:11] in the street of the gate of ephraim
[49:13] and all the congregation of them that
[49:14] were come again out of the captivity
[49:17] made booths and sat under the boots for
[49:19] since the days of jeshua the son of nun
[49:22] unto that day
[49:23] had not the children of israel done so
[49:26] so it wasn't until jesus that
[49:27] when jesus had brought him out amen or
[49:29] they crossed over amen they had not done
[49:31] this
[49:32] amen or practice the feast of
[49:34] tabernacles
[49:35] amen
[49:39] and there was very great gladness
[49:42] amen also day by day from the first day
[49:45] unto the last day
[49:46] he read in the book of the law of god
[49:49] and they kept the feast
[49:50] seven days and on the eighth day was a
[49:52] solemn assembly
[49:53] according to the manner amen
[49:57] praise god glory bro so that means they
[50:00] had
[50:00] church every single day
[50:04] amen i know in foreign foreign countries
[50:08] amen sometimes they have six services a
[50:10] week
[50:12] or something related to church amen
[50:16] imagine if we went that way how many of
[50:18] us would be complaining and how many of
[50:19] us would be
[50:20] amen we should be excited about this
[50:22] word when we have the opportunity amen
[50:25] to be gathered with brothers and sisters
[50:26] the like person's faith
[50:27] to hear the word that should excite us
[50:29] amen praise god
[50:31] amen i'm not i'm not saints i'm not i'm
[50:34] not uh
[50:34] i'm speaking to myself as well amen
[50:37] because i
[50:38] i i need this just as much as you do
[50:40] amen
[50:41] praise the lord because sometimes it's
[50:43] so easy to just get caught up in
[50:44] routines
[50:46] the routine of the service and the
[50:48] routine of of uh you know
[50:51] of how things are done amen and and and
[50:54] we just get caught up in the routines of
[50:56] life
[50:56] amen and the word of god has no effect
[50:58] on us anymore
[50:59] i already know that you know amen but
[51:02] are you living it
[51:03] right that's the thing you might know it
[51:06] but are you living it
[51:06] praise god john 5 37
[51:10] tells us and the father himself with
[51:12] which has sent me
[51:14] hath born witness of me ye have neither
[51:16] heard his voice at any time
[51:17] nor seen his shape and ye have not his
[51:20] word abiding in you for whom he hath
[51:22] sent
[51:22] him he believe not search the scriptures
[51:25] for in them you think you have eternal
[51:26] life
[51:27] and they are they which testify of me
[51:30] amen so the word will never lead you to
[51:32] nobody else
[51:32] but to him amen to himself and you will
[51:36] and you will not come to me that you may
[51:38] you might have life
[51:40] amen ii timothy tells us
[51:43] of these things verse 14 of these things
[51:47] uh of these things put them in
[51:49] remembrance charging them before the
[51:50] lord that they strive not about words to
[51:53] no prophet
[51:54] but to the subverting of the hearers
[51:56] study to show thyself approved unto god
[51:59] a workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[52:02] rightly dividing the word of truth amen
[52:04] you should know amen we should all know
[52:06] how to explain amen
[52:08] uh serpentine through the scriptures
[52:11] we should not explain water baptism amen
[52:14] by just the word
[52:16] amen
[52:18] well we were lying man again on brother
[52:20] branham said brother branham said
[52:21] brother branham said and that's not
[52:22] going to lead somebody to the lord
[52:24] right that's not exactly right the word
[52:26] is the only thing that you have in
[52:27] common with the people out there
[52:29] amen amen the word is the only thing
[52:31] that's going to be able to win them amen
[52:33] praise god then they'll understand amen
[52:36] the further
[52:36] revelation amen that god sent a prophet
[52:38] and things like that amen
[52:40] i i believe it that way amen praise god
[52:45] but shine profane and vain babblings for
[52:48] they will increase unto more ungodliness
[52:51] amen praise god
[52:55] brother branham says here brother we've
[52:58] made
[52:58] we've weighed a past the borders the
[53:00] mercy until there is nothing left but
[53:03] judgment
[53:04] but the righteous will not have to be
[53:06] punished with the unrighteous
[53:08] god will come and jesus will redeem his
[53:09] church and we'll go up in the air to
[53:11] meet him
[53:12] and it will be far beyond any bombs or
[53:14] any troubles
[53:15] and will be protected during that time
[53:18] look what it says here so children back
[53:20] to your god quickly
[53:22] don't tangle with the world for anything
[53:24] stay out of this modern world
[53:26] stay out of these modern theologies amen
[53:30] even in the ranks of this message amen
[53:36] because i'll say this the message itself
[53:39] amen
[53:39] can't be denominated but people have
[53:41] made it a denomination exactly right
[53:43] i have seen it personally and i know i'm
[53:45] sure brother dale has too
[53:47] i have experienced people have
[53:48] denominated this this message amen
[53:51] and set little little little little
[53:53] little uh you know
[53:55] clans and things amen and if you don't
[53:57] belong to this here i mean you're not
[53:59] part of us amen

[54:18] amen
[54:21] you know that's a very easy thing to say
[54:22] but that's one of the hardest things for
[54:24] us to do
[54:26] as christians don't be weary

[55:27] this little presentation real quick
[55:30] but uh but terence i might i might end
[55:32] up going over tonight
[55:33] so
[55:37] amen praise god
[55:40] amen but uh
[55:44] brother branham brother branham it was
[55:46] interesting that when brother branham
[55:48] preached the uh
[55:49] the the seventh seal amen
[55:52] and uh he had preached the six seals and
[55:55] i believe it was a sunday
[55:57] morning a sunday morning i preached i
[55:59] think he preached the seventh seal
[56:02] and you know a lot had already been said
[56:05] a lot had
[56:06] had already been been been brought forth
[56:08] amen
[56:09] but what brother branham brings in amen
[56:11] brings forth amen and he tells the
[56:13] people and encourages the people amen
[56:16] is that and i'm just sort of
[56:17] paraphrasing him and what he said
[56:19] because i have it all
[56:20] written here but i just don't have all
[56:22] full time to read it but he's told he
[56:23] tells the people he says
[56:26] i know there's going to be a lot of
[56:27] questions are going to arise a lot of
[56:28] people are going to try to go
[56:30] off trying to explain this what had
[56:32] already been preached amen in the last
[56:34] last six services and he said but you
[56:37] just
[56:37] leave that leave that leave that alone
[56:39] amen
[56:40] don't go try to explaining it uh your
[56:43] own don't go try to run off
[56:45] amen with the thing because why it's
[56:47] gonna get you in more trouble amen
[56:51] and uh uh and i believe and it was
[56:53] interesting amen that that he said
[56:55] something like that amen when when such
[56:58] a great revelations and such great
[57:00] things
[57:00] amen was coming forth and this is what
[57:03] what he says here towards the end of the
[57:05] of the script you can read it in the in
[57:07] the uh
[57:08] questions and answers on the seal uh
[57:10] that was that sunday morning
[57:12] towards the end of all that he says
[57:15] he says uh let me see here
[57:20] i'll just start on down down at the
[57:22] bottom at 6 16
[57:23] it says and so but if the church you're
[57:26] not supposed to know these things
[57:28] so don't put no interpretation to
[57:30] anything amen see
[57:32] you just go ahead and just remember what
[57:35] you're told
[57:36] live a christian life amen
[57:39] go to your church be a real light
[57:42] wherever you are
[57:43] and just burn for christ and tell the
[57:46] people
[57:46] that how you love him right but you
[57:49] can't do that if you're not in the word
[57:51] right you can't do that if you don't go
[57:54] to church
[57:56] amen be a real light wherever you are
[57:58] and just burn for christ and tell the
[58:00] people that how you love him
[58:02] and just let your testimony be with love
[58:04] all the time
[58:05] with the people because if you don't you
[58:07] twist yourself
[58:08] out into something there and then you're
[58:10] you're off the beaten track
[58:13] and how many people how many things
[58:15] would have been avoided
[58:17] if they would have just taken this
[58:18] advice for brother branham amen
[58:20] how many doctrines that have rose up
[58:22] since that time
[58:23] would have been avoided if they would
[58:25] have just taken this thing amen
[58:27] that brother brown was telling see every
[58:29] time you try to do it you've done that
[58:30] see
[58:31] so you so just don't don't try to make
[58:33] no interpretation
[58:35] and especially tonight when that seal
[58:36] becomes up in front of you see
[58:38] just don't try to interpret you just go
[58:40] ahead and just be humble and go right on
[58:42] with the same plain message amen
[58:45] now you say brother branham is that we
[58:47] be in the church of the living god
[58:49] shouldn't we well as i was trying to
[58:50] look here i want to say
[58:52] why can't i out to have no no i don't
[58:54] you remember i'm saying this for you
[58:56] good see i'm saying
[58:57] all right so that you'll understand amen
[58:59] so
[59:00] he tells him it's such a great thing
[59:02] amen such a great thing that god did in
[59:04] this our day amen to open back amen the
[59:06] seals amen to break those seals and to
[59:08] reveal them to us amen
[59:10] and this is and this is what brother
[59:12] branham is telling us to do amen
[59:15] praise god i believe a lot of preachers
[59:18] amen wouldn't have been in so much
[59:19] trouble if they would have just taken
[59:20] that advice
[59:22] amen but because we want to uh uh prove
[59:25] our own thing and we want
[59:27] we have our own agendas that we want to
[59:28] prove amen we get in trouble amen when
[59:32] we just don't take god amen in
[59:33] simplicity
[59:34] amen that doesn't mean amen that that
[59:37] you ca that you're you're simple and
[59:38] just
[59:39] and you don't get in the word amen you
[59:41] get in the word amen
[59:42] praise god and uh so
[59:46] that's i i just encourage you all amen
[59:48] as this new year's coming saints
[59:50] to just get excited about the word of
[59:53] god glory amen
[59:54] amen don't don't just take church as a
[59:56] routine amen
[59:57] and don't just take church amen that
[59:59] well brother dale will always be there
[1:00:01] and
[1:00:02] brother wade will always be there and uh
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] but one of these days amen if the lord
[1:00:08] tarries brother dale may not be with us
[1:00:10] exactly brother wade amen
[1:00:13] as mortals amen we gotta have to go
[1:00:15] sometime right what are we gonna do then
[1:00:19] amen if you're not in the word yourself
[1:00:22] amen bradel's not you're gonna
[1:00:23] not get in because we're hanging on
[1:00:25] brother dale's coattail amen
[1:00:28] absolutely not you're not going to get
[1:00:30] in on hanger brother wade's coattail
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:32] you're going to get in amen because you
[1:00:34] had a personal relationship with christ
[1:00:36] and his word thank you lord amen the
[1:00:38] holy ghost dwelling in you amen
[1:00:40] living that life through you praise god
[1:00:43] amen so
[1:00:44] some of you are probably wondering i
[1:00:46] didn't know he was that hard
[1:00:49] well i was soft last time now i had to
[1:00:51] get a little tough last this time amen
[1:00:53] nah i i need that two saints all that i
[1:00:56] need myself
[1:00:57] because i get slack amen and and and
[1:01:01] even
[1:01:01] some people think that ministers don't
[1:01:03] struggle amen we struggle too
[1:01:04] amen we're flesh and blood just like you
[1:01:07] that's why we need your prayers amen
[1:01:09] praise god so i certainly covet your
[1:01:12] prayers
[1:01:13] as we'll be heading out here in just a
[1:01:15] couple of weeks we'll be heading to
[1:01:17] canada
[1:01:18] have um we weren't planning on going to
[1:01:22] canada but as you all know my
[1:01:23] mother-in-law
[1:01:24] had this tumor and uh and thankfully
[1:01:27] it's been removed
[1:01:28] we want to spend some time with the
[1:01:29] family so uh
[1:01:31] we're we're going to be in canada and
[1:01:33] another reason why is because since i'm
[1:01:35] leaving tour
[1:01:36] to nicaragua i'm first heading to costa
[1:01:39] rica on january 1st
[1:01:40] we'll be there for four day meeting and
[1:01:42] then from costa rica we'll be
[1:01:44] flying uh to nicaragua and we'll be
[1:01:47] there for about 15 days
[1:01:49] so you remember us in prayer we're
[1:01:51] supposed to hold
[1:01:52] uh quite a few meetings and um
[1:01:56] and um as well as uh
[1:01:59] be uh we're gonna be like 10 hours up in
[1:02:01] the mountains in nicaragua
[1:02:03] where uh brother mike siebert told me
[1:02:06] that uh they don't have any
[1:02:07] electricity up there or anything amen so
[1:02:10] uh
[1:02:11] so you remember us in prayer amen the
[1:02:12] lord would just have his way
[1:02:14] and uh i like the song that brother
[1:02:16] royle soriano from from
[1:02:19] the philippines he wrote and he said and
[1:02:22] the song goes just to be a blessing
[1:02:24] i'll go on a journey climb up the
[1:02:26] highest mountain and cross the deep blue
[1:02:28] sea
[1:02:29] amen it's just to be a blessing amen and
[1:02:32] uh cause
[1:02:34] sometimes you just don't know amen you
[1:02:36] might just be there just for one person
[1:02:38] amen but it'll be worth it all amen
[1:02:41] and that's all i want to do amen just to
[1:02:43] be a blessing amen
[1:02:45] praise god so you remember us in prayer
[1:02:47] lord willing we'll be back
[1:02:48] around january 22nd or so amen and uh
[1:02:53] um just pray for us pray for our family
[1:02:55] the lord would just give us a prosperous
[1:02:57] trip amen
[1:02:58] i believe he will amen praise god now
[1:03:01] brother
[1:03:02] brother anderson if you want to bring up
[1:03:03] the uh
[1:03:05] i know last year when i ministered here
[1:03:07] uh right before i left to the
[1:03:08] philippines

[1:03:16] things and so i
[1:03:18] i had created this this powerpoint

[1:03:22] but i didn't get to show it amen here at
[1:03:24] the uh
[1:03:26] here to the church and so i figured

[1:03:30] heading over there
[1:03:31] pretty much almost traveling about the
[1:03:33] same same way that that

[1:11:29] quickly what common philippine traffic
[1:11:31] looks like
[1:11:46] it's towards the end where it gets
[1:11:47] better
[1:11:50] no tractor trailers no
[1:11:53] there's is this is like the equivalent
[1:11:56] of um
[1:11:58] i don't know but maybe riding on 985
[1:12:00] two-lane highway
[1:12:02] but but but the traffic is so much you
[1:12:05] can't ride at the same speed at 985
[1:12:07] and people uh and people look just
[1:12:09] jaywalking in the middle of
[1:12:13] i mean it's just you got a policeman
[1:12:15] there supposedly controlling things but
[1:12:18] he's just there on the sidelines
[1:12:20] there's not much he can do
[1:12:24] those are the gypnies that's right
[1:12:26] jeepneys
[1:12:27] they're a very popular former
[1:12:28] transportation in the philippines and

[1:13:29] both times that i've been to the
[1:13:30] philippines i've only seen one accident
[1:13:33] and that was because the car had lost
[1:13:36] his brakes

[1:24:53] living there that's just so beautiful
[1:24:56] amen we stopped at this brother's house
[1:25:00] and uh this is the little babies where
[1:25:02] they where they sleep we had a little
[1:25:05] stopping point and uh we
[1:25:09] just a real quick testimony the brothers
[1:25:10] they were in control they were
[1:25:12] you know riding the boat with us the
[1:25:14] pasture there in this area
[1:25:16] he he's a deep sea diver and uh he
[1:25:20] um brother royal had uh
[1:25:23] had uh had asked if it was possible when
[1:25:26] we go down there
[1:25:27] is it possible that you can maybe get
[1:25:29] some lobsters
[1:25:30] for for for us and the brother told him
[1:25:33] he said brother
[1:25:34] at this time of the year it's really
[1:25:35] difficult to find lobsters in this area
[1:25:38] and he said but i'll do my best now i
[1:25:41] believe the brother had a desire
[1:25:43] because he really wanted to um he wanted
[1:25:45] to
[1:25:46] serve us you know and he said that he
[1:25:48] prayed to the lord
[1:25:50] and he went to an area that he had never
[1:25:52] fished before but he said but he said
[1:25:54] he he felt led to go that way and he
[1:25:56] went down there and
[1:25:57] three three over three other of the
[1:25:59] divers went down there with him he
[1:26:01] stayed up at the top of the boat
[1:26:02] and they were these little helmets with
[1:26:04] the little light right
[1:26:05] and they put these traps in the bottom
[1:26:07] of the ocean and when they
[1:26:09] when they placed the trap uh one of the
[1:26:11] brothers said the brother the pastor
[1:26:12] said that
[1:26:13] he saw three lights and all of a sudden
[1:26:15] he saw a fourth light
[1:26:17] in there somewhere he said there was no
[1:26:18] bow anywhere
[1:26:20] and it was nothing like that well when
[1:26:22] they came they they left the traps there
[1:26:24] and they came and picked us up and we we
[1:26:26] we got there to this area
[1:26:28] where they had set the traps at and
[1:26:30] there was
[1:26:31] five lobsters in that in that in that
[1:26:34] thing
[1:26:35] and one of them was big too now this is
[1:26:38] a
[1:26:38] the brother said he had never fished
[1:26:40] lobster in that area before and it was
[1:26:42] out of season
[1:26:43] i believe god gives you the desires of
[1:26:45] your heart amen when you're sincere amen
[1:26:48] next slide brother i think this is just
[1:26:51] a quick video of just one of them that
[1:26:53] that
[1:26:54] that we took
[1:27:00] it's huge
[1:27:04] so um and there was a couple more in
[1:27:06] there
[1:27:07] one of them's like a king lobster
[1:27:10] so god god god will give you the desires
[1:27:13] of your heart amen
[1:27:14] he knows that he knows he knows why
[1:27:16] you're asking for things
[1:27:17] amen praise god next slide
[1:27:24] when we were riding back to the area
[1:27:26] where we were going to have service
[1:27:28] with the brothers there was a storm over
[1:27:30] here to the right and you'll see
[1:27:32] these waves started getting bigger and
[1:27:34] bigger we got to about four or five feet
[1:27:36] foot waves it's kind of scary but
[1:27:40] this is my first time ever doing this
[1:27:42] but these brothers and these boats it
[1:27:44] was nothing to them
[1:27:46] they had just cooked these uh these uh
[1:27:48] lobsters
[1:27:49] they boiled them in this little thing in
[1:27:51] the uh in water
[1:27:52] in the in the boat and we were there
[1:27:55] just right before we took off we were
[1:27:57] eating lobster and brother royal was
[1:27:58] still finishing up his lobster
[1:28:00] and you'll see here in just a moment
[1:28:02] boats rocking and things
[1:28:07] and brother rorell is just sitting there
[1:28:09] just eating lobster like it's not
[1:28:11] it's not bothering him one bit you'll
[1:28:14] see here in just a moment
[1:28:30] so uh and this is uh over here
[1:28:33] to the left that's the pasture there
[1:28:37] brother uh the long long
[1:28:41] okay go ahead brother angels
[1:28:44] when i met brother his name is brother
[1:28:46] long long long long
[1:28:47] and brother royal told me he said this
[1:28:49] is brother long long but you can
[1:28:51] call him long for short
[1:28:56] we got a kick out of that um when we
[1:28:59] when we when we stopped at the place
[1:29:00] where we were going to have service
[1:29:03] we couldn't take the boat all the way in
[1:29:05] so we had to get in
[1:29:07] in the middle of all that and and walk
[1:29:09] it off
[1:29:14] carrying our our things once you get
[1:29:17] closer to the shore it gets it's just
[1:29:19] dirty
[1:29:19] and a lot like trash and things like
[1:29:22] that and
[1:29:23] you have to walk all in that so i
[1:29:25] believe there was one
[1:29:26] part here where i think i saw something
[1:29:28] swimming in the water it looked like an
[1:29:30] eel or something
[1:29:32] we just kept going
[1:29:37] all right go ahead brother anderson
[1:29:41] that night we had services brother long
[1:29:43] long and they didn't have they don't
[1:29:44] have an actual church
[1:29:46] they they meet at his sister's house and
[1:29:49] was an interesting brother long long i
[1:29:51] preached i was going to preach a certain
[1:29:52] message that night
[1:29:54] and i felt led to speak on something
[1:29:56] else about about the treasures of the
[1:29:58] heart
[1:29:58] amen or finding where your treasure is
[1:30:01] where your heart is there your treasure
[1:30:02] would be also
[1:30:03] i didn't know that after the service
[1:30:05] brother long long
[1:30:06] uh through brother royal interpreting he
[1:30:08] said brother we really i really
[1:30:10] appreciate you ministering that
[1:30:11] he said because apparently brother long
[1:30:14] long he had
[1:30:14] he had backslid a few years ago and the
[1:30:17] reason why he had backslid was because
[1:30:19] he was trying
[1:30:20] they do a lot of treasure hunting in
[1:30:21] that area and uh
[1:30:23] he he he had backslid because of that
[1:30:25] and so it was a weakness
[1:30:27] in in in their life i had no idea
[1:30:30] and that's just how the lord leads amen
[1:30:33] amen we just i just thank god for that
[1:30:37] amen so from there uh we went that night
[1:30:40] uh
[1:30:41] to uh uh polly island uh
[1:30:44] keep going brother anderson that was
[1:30:46] where we were at where we preached the
[1:30:47] brother long lungs
[1:30:48] and then from there that night after the

[1:31:12] excited about the word and brother royal
