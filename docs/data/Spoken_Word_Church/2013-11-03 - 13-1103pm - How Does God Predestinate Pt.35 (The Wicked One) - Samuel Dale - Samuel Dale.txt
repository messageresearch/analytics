been reading Romans 8 28-31 then we'll go to 2 Corinthians 11:3 and then 1 Corinthians 15:22 remember thaten remember the Lord willing next Sunday brother Claude wisinger will be here for the weekend and just pray for him that the Lord would would bless him and and be with him and uh remember uh the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday at brother uh Tony is there at Six Flags so if anybody wants to go and everything you know remember that it be there um and also as far as right now because of his problems he had with not being able to come brother for you know his mother passed away but the Lord willing he will be with us the last Sunday of this month which I think is the 24th but he will be with us probably on the Wednesday just dropping in and we'll be hunting for a few days and and then you know be here for the weekend so remember that uh all right we've thank the Lord that brother Al passed his stress test amen he passed his stress test and so that was good and there's a sister I forgot to mention this morning there's a sister up at Brother Richard Wilson's that needs a special prayer uh a touch from the Lord and you remember brother Hall that used to be there brother Richards um he has had a lot of manyi strokes and he lost a a lot of his memory so just remember that uh to pray for him because most of you remember brother Hall and everything and the Lord willing next Sunday brother Terrence mentioned that brother Serano he's doing better but he still got a long road to go you know about his heart and heart attacks and things that he's had uh they can't give him one thing because of the other backward and forth uh they have no insurance so the next Sunday the Lord willing we will just pass a special plate you know for brother Serano to uh send to him you know to try to help him along a little and also remember that next Sunday all right any other announcements I generally Miss again we say thank you to everybody for the uh time that we had yesterday at the uh down at the uh railroad tracks and all the kids are playing and that's having a good time and and all like that we really appreciate you coming and being there is real good turnout and we had a good time we didn't uh we didn't get to announce either a uh what we were going to talk about on the next uh Bible study which would be December the first Saturday in December but uh it's been mentioned a couple of times that maybe to some of you that I need to go over a little bit uh like your seven Church ages but eight manifestations of God EX Etc and things like that so we don't have anything announced so we'll try to do that you know there on that one to see you know and that way you can fit it together how the messenger comes at the End of the Age and and what those things means and and it would help I believe to understand a lot of things because remember brother R said I'm not the messenger to lady oia that's right right he said don't do that said you make me a Lady of sin right see he's a messenger to the bride right so we got to know and understand how everything fits together or we'll have it running wrong on what we're trying to study but just remember that okay Romans 8 2 Corinthians 11 1 Corinthians 15 Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace unto each and every one of us we thank you for Calvary thank you for loving us because if you hadn't loved us where would we be even the best that we could do in all of life of everything would not be sufficient in any form to stand before a living God but yet you made a way and you asked us to come boldly so we come boldly before your throne and asking you to bless each and every one remember Brother Dean there Lord is speaking down to his brothers remember Wade there for brother Burley and just be with them probably all on the way home now take care of them give them a safe journey we just ask you to guide each one and keep us we love you and we thank you Father but more than anything in the world we want you to cleanse us and guide us forgive our sins because that's what we desire in Jesus name amen Romans 8 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren more over whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen so let's go to now to 2 Corinthians we've used this but just kind of putting together a few little things and bringing it over in the message if you have any questions we will have questions and answers um maybe next Sunday I'm not certain it's just how far we're going and what we're going to try to to get through and and do but write down your questions your thoughts your comments and we'll be glad to try to cover these things okay 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begal Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ all right 1 Corinthians 15 22 for as in Adam all die so as in Christ shall all be made alive amen you may be seated it I hope we're getting a good thought on the uh two trees and understanding the tree of life being Christ the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil being Satan and coming down to giving us an understanding of uh you know where we're at now what I've been trying to do in these past few Services uh the reason we kind of you know we came down through uh studying on uh predestination and how God predestines by for knowledge not by desire and coming down to uh getting to the garden and seeing what's taking place and I hope you're you're seeing these and I start picking up a little bit on brother brandom said that God had a predestinated plan and it was necessary that these things take place to fulfill his plan remember he predestinated by for knowledge so his plan would have to be covered in for knowledge so we came we went through the for knowledge and selling the things we went up into Glory spent a few Services preaching of what was in heaven and then Dro back down to earth now to pick up and look at the forn knowledge of God and looking at it and seeing uh you know what is taking place upon Earth and knowing that God would know all of those things there would be nothing pulled over on him but knowing that if he gave us a choice we would follow and see it would be be something for you and I to say boy if I'd have been back there you know have you ever noticed people to say that you remember they said it to Jesus something paraphrasing it you know if we'd have been back dire they wouldn't have killed in Prophecy he said you polish the tombs of the guys that done the killing right see but we think oh I wouldn't have done it now I have been worse it's just the best way to do it cuz Adam and Eve started off real good we started off junk but that's just you know the life all right but now remember our Point here is what we're trying to do look at what happened back there and for the past few Services if you'll watch this you'll see what I've been doing we look back there to see what took place in the garden but then coming over and seeing what's taking place to you and I now that's been my kind of theme for the past few Services is not to look back at them you remember the prophet said that's what man will do he looks back he looks forward forgetting what's taking place all right so we need to look to what's going on in our hearts and our lives from that and as we do then we can can pick up in you know and see what's going on you know maybe the Lord willing another message or so we kind of click in to you to understand that because I want to talk about uh the seat of the woman getting into that but now this past Wednesday night I went through and trying to get us to look at something that to me has been very interesting and I've heard it scrambled over and preached on and everything else but you know we just take a few quotes and we quote oursel to death instead of taking the entire message and you remember our Wednesday night now just back up just to H that we were covering how brother brandham said in the breach that Adam fell from eternal life to death there in the garden and brought all mankind unto death well L some five or six months before then he was talking about how that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and gave him eternal life especially into Adam well now did Adam fall from eternal life as we are thinking in our mind as to just quote something because how can you fall from eternal life where would you fall to if you fell from eternal life you would go to death right is that sensible I don't think there a gray area that we could fall from eternal life flop in the middle wait around a little while at while get back over and go the other way I I don't think that way I believe if you fell from eternal life as we think it then you would die and you'd be lost and you go to hell cuz you'd fall to death all but you remember what I was trying to bring out now Adam never received eternal life in his body he was put out of the garden said lest they partake of the tree of life and live forever so he didn't die from he didn't fall to death like lost but he fell from the situ situation that he could never attain unto eternal life in body cuz that's what you and I are doing you and I because of the fall and because of the way things are going and Satan penetrating our mind you and I right now are falling from eternal life my brother Dale it's right there before us it's the message this message is eternal life Jesus said my words are life and see we're falling to death why we're dying that's what happened to Adam he died physically speaking but he never lost eternal life cuz God's not an ending Giver well I think I don't care what you think I'm sorry I done preach too long and I don't I this church never got to the size it is now me petting you and I don't intend to do it now I just intend to keep preaching if you don't believe what I believe that's up to you and I don't believe you can have eternal life and fall from it cuz that make God an ending Giver thatd make something but we can have eternal life in our soul and die and go by the grave and we're going to do that because I was trying to preach on death remember we're going to keep dying until somebody gets into the message andless the message get into them and walk on into the word of God we're going to keep dying because if you understand what I'm saying Adam never lost his eternal life he just never attained into eternal life In the Flesh that's to me is simple it's just like he would say on who is this meled we'll get back to it eventually he said we by P pass or theophany he's done covered in the message your soul is your theophany did we bypass our soul no we bypassed coming the way Jesus came all right was it a 285 Journey around Atlanta you know bypass around the city no we just never came that way is that simple I like things simple that I can understand with the ninth grade education I I have problems comprehending all of these great terminologies you know I like it simple so we didn't bypass at theop didn't come around it we just never came that way Adam never lost eternal life in his soul and become a lost being that way he lost eternal life In the Flesh and that throwed you and I to death amen and as I said and I'll say again as long as we keep pity pattering around playing little games you know we're going to still die and go by the grave I thank God he keep his promise you'll bring us out where do we get to that in the message if we get that far today all right but do you understand what I'm trying to get at yes the whole human race was thrown into sin by Adam as we read and saying that in Adam all die but you know what I love about the scriptures I I love it because God doesn't leave us dangling it's just like you know where we read there in second Corinthians About Eve that Satan through his subtility deceive us like he did Eve through the Simplicity that is in Christ Jesus it always goes to the good side all right in in 1 Corinthians 15:22 as in Adam all die but what is the rest so even so in Christ shall all be alive Made Alive it's always an upcoming you know a mother remember a brother very legalistic man and but he said you can preach people under the table you know beat on them real hard but he said always give them a little out at the end you know and I thought that's a good point all right now listen sickness sorrow heartaches troubles Etc came by the Fall that we were bringing out this morning as to seeing that you know Eve had an affair with the Beast we don't have to jump back over that too much uh it give us an opportunity to just run right through the scriptures you know and and bring it down because you don't want to leave company to where that they can't follow what you're doing and just hear you say some little something and don't explain it it's hard enough as it is to explain it to the best you can and then people misunderstand because of their teaching but I can't help that but I can help doing one thing I can look at the Bible and and I can let the Bible interpret itself unto me that I can see and understand the uh doings and that's what I'd like to do is we'll just start if we don't get through the message uh we'll get it Wednesday but we went through what happened in the garden we went through how even in me or other messages how that uh Adam wasn't cursed Eve wasn't cursed brother Rand said but the Beast the snake was you know the Beast was cursed made a snake the ground was cursed and all of the things and uh you know and even in uh Cain it says that the world was cursed on account of him in doing what he was doing and it brought him to a place of being in trouble with God all right and then it brought him to this situation that we want to take just a little bit today and think about just take the scripture we've been through it but I've got a little bit coming on down so uh listen very M very carefully so go ahead brother and let's pull up Genesis 4 we were in Genesis 3 let's pull up Genesis 4 and 1 and just think about what is said and I want you to listen very carefully uh Genesis 41 Adam knew his wife and she conceived and BARC and said I've gotten a man from the Lord now does that scripture bother you now what I mean by it is it looks like that it's saying that uh Cain was Adam's son right I mean you read it and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bar came and said I've gotten a man from the Lord but when you come to a revelation of something then you see uh that even though we read words words are not not a revelation that's right a revelation comes because of words right but it's not always like brother R says the Bible says uh Judas went and hung himself and said you go do likewise he just gave you the scripture but he took one from here and one from here all right now I want you to and I'm not very good on English you know that anybody on the internet know that in a hurry uh I like what sister Julie said when they went up to Canada brother Boyd and him and they asked him where they were from and when they got through telling them where they were from they said we know you got to be an American because of the way you're talking you know I mean they' know we were Georgians by our words right but now think about it do you know that that's exactly right yes sir that scripture is identically perfectly right but it hid from the eyes of smart mankind the way God said it hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent that's right but see it's according to how you read it right it's according to where you pause and what you emphasize right now think about it and Adam knew his wife he did Adam knew his wife he had a relation with his wife right right that's exactly right but then when you say then Cain is the son of Adam see now you're reading wrong so take this old ninth grade education and drop it for what you want to Adam knew his wife that's exactly right and she conceived and that's exactly right and barcan and that's exactly right and said I've gotten a man from the Lord and that's exactly right cuz all life comes from God so we read the scripture and we say it's right but now for me to read it and say but look there brother Dale and Adam knew his wife and she con and knew his wife and she conceived and by Cain the Bible says Cain's the son of Adam come on but we know about Revelation by the next verses and the different things and Cain was not the son of Adam so now we come back to simple logic so we read it this way and and Adam knew his wife and she conceived she did she brought Abel and barcan conjunction and barcan and she said I've gotten a man from the Lord cuz she never placed it brother R said saying that Adam was the father of King he said because all life comes from God right all right no matter how dirty the mom and daddy is or whatever it is no baby ever come from anybody but God he has to permit that person to be born all right now you can read the scriptures and it it should take away that little you know uh part in you that would say but but that surely doesn't look like that it's saying that Cain is the son of Adam but it's not it's according to where you're breaking your thought and what you're saying all right now because it goes to the next and she again bear his brother abble so there's two times of new you know and the one time of new is here and the other one is like chapter five where he knew Adam knew his wife Eve she bear a son called his name Seth see so there's only the one aair or one thing was between Adam and Eve but yet then there's one between Eve and the Beast and there you got your twins that we were talking about this morning all right and against you are his brother and Abel was a keeper of sheep the Cain was a tiller of the ground sister bar brought it to my attention that uh you know that Cain was a tiller of the ground but because of the Fall he became an Eater of meat that's it's a good thought he became Eater of meat CU he started hunting Cain was a great hunter see Nimrod and all of that coming forth so it started changing things because of the fall all right but now what what I want us to look at today is to look at uh we'll get to it later as the wicked one but I want us to look at the uh attributes as we spoke of you know how that sin is unbelief but then there's always attributes to be displayed the dranking gam and smoking Etc is an attribute a display of your unbelief so then there had to be something happened there was an unbelief right disbelief but then there was a display of that unbelief and we can see what happened in the human race and to look and see what the fall brought to pass you know upon the human race all right and just think about it a little and think about the things that took place all right verse three and then in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought her the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord now we're reading a little bit that he was a very good religious man that he was a very a devout worker you know he worked himself to death building an altar raising the fruit or whatever you want to do or going out and Gathering or whatever can Abel's lay up under a tree with his hands back behind his head you know and he offers blood and oh my God what he what are you doing you're a murderer you know you you're You're a murderer you're mean God and to think that God made him quats of skin you know but Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering and brother brandham said I gave them to you we read them past Wednesday on paragraph 246 PR of transformation 1965 he said Cain knew the the perfect will of God but he refused to do it he said Can knew and it's that one and it's a power of transformation and it's that one and it's in the other one God's power to transform he said Can knew the perfect will of God but wouldn't do it he said Cain knew that God accepted Abel's message now bring that on down to this day we talk about a message coming in end time and we see a man get up and preach a message and we see him challenging the people to come up and to prove his message was right God comes down down heals the sick raises the dead discernment calling out Etc but he had 300 preachers remember that one time that he was talking to him about water baptism oh they all right there in front of him we want them tapes we want so many hundred of them he said not a one ever came back amen now we look back there and think about a horrible thing but I love the reason he used it in both of those quotes I'm and I'm sure he was referring to his message he said Cain knew the will of God he said can you that God accepted Abel's message well I never read in I were able had a message what was Able's message came we was born in Mama's blood from Daddy's blood there's blood in the garden right surely they discussed what they believe they were not just 10y old kids they were probably in their 20s and offering sacrifices what was Abel's message it was speaking of the blood of Jesus Christ Cain turned that down he had a great understanding he had a great intellectual uh understanding he could see in plain language that his sacrifice was rejected so that meant his message was rejected what was Cain's message that it was fruit right that they ate apples you know oranges pomegranates or something and God rejected Cain's message right but accepted Abels you youever read around and say that Abel had a revelation I agree with that but do we need to read these two quotes again for you to understand that Cain had a great knowledge can a had a great understanding of what Abel was talking about right because he knew the perfect will of God you said Brother D I i' sure let to love know the perfect will of God for my life you might be walking in it right in the middle of it but just think of about it he told him in that power of transformation what I said people in the message and say but brother Dale Cain couldn't be saved brother random said he could so that solves it in the message power of transformation paragraph 18 through 184 brother ROM says God said do like your brother and I'll receive you let's see there's another one in here I'll get it to you in a minute he said God went after Cain but yet we get this great Revelation the serpent seed can't be saved you show me where and what's the difference in the body the body the body everybody got it the body of a born again believer and the body of a lost person what is the difference in it it's all body that's right and I wouldn't care if I run my DNA all the way back and found out I was a direct descendant from the Beast I shout Glory Hallelujah cuz my dependence is not in the flesh it's in the the god that's right the new birth yes sir Jesus never said to Nicodemus Nicodemus you got a possibility to be born again but these other people out here are serpent seed I got a quote where brother Brown said the serpent seed is so spread until there's only a small portion of the seed of the woman left he said it spread to the world right all right but think about it now what happened and why would verse six verse five and Cain is off Cain was very wro and his countenance fail and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen now where did that come from now he's upset right countenance Fallen mad you know irritated and even his countenance you know what I mean you're supposed to be but then the other uh right even his countenance I'm preaching here a lot of time and I'm looking back at you and I wonder what in the world they thinking cuz it sure ain't showing up on the face I told him I said when you're scanning the things and and you don't know they're doing it they just scanned it while ago I was sitting back there watching you while you're singing be careful about you sleeping they can scan you and show everybody in the country what you're doing but I've caution them please don't zero in on somebody that's you try to find somebody's screening kind like Wade said you know what does these newcomers think when we don't even amen what the pastor's saying that's right and you ain't going to get no amen out no I ain't trying to CU if you're amening out of the fact of what was said about that you're a hypocrite is that plain enough I amen what I believe and I have amen a lot of things the preacher said and right in the middle of it he changed the thought and I got caught and had to say uhoh I don't agree with that life fart I amen what I believe so evidently most of you don't believe all why is your countenance falling okay why you Ro at me would you understand yes where did that come from that's all the question I'm asking where did all of that where did that come from it couldn't come from God that's right it doesn't talk about able being that way and we're going to read some things and just a second on the scripture so look what he said verse if thou doest well shalt thou not be done not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire sin and thou shalt rule over him you can rule over sin if you want to if you don't you can follow after it all right and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am My Brother's Keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground what about a man am I My Brother's Keeper what why you getting on to me about it the man that killed him where would that come from the effects the attribute right right the attribute was Cain right amen Cain's attributes is showing what nature he is of brother R said what about a human being would stand in the presence of God and speak like that rebuking God devil ain't even that bad come on you just put a little bit of devil in a man and you got something worse than the devil right cu the devil don't have a physical Force to display his anger agree he can enter animals he can do things but he has no ability but the man has a physical force and he did he killed Abel now I was listening got one in the truck I listened to a lot about the church ages and brother BR said you might think that this is so so he said because I'm making it so hard he said but I want you to know that I'm not talking about just outlandishly mean not talking about this but just talk outlandishly wrong stuff that the churches are doing he said it's just that tiny little thing see remember they're going to church right over here this afternoon remember they're worshiping remember they're crying and praying to God right and you know God can come over there and bless people and heal people what come on so we think of Cain then after we do finally get to thought well Cain was just a mean old guy how mean was he number one it mentions him first making the offering he worshiped right come on he worshiped right he wanted to go to church go ahead with number two now let's get a few of these is said Abraham's Covenant confirmed 1961 318 e51 so many today God you'll give your intellects to God what now so many today God you'll give your intellect see we'll give our intellects to God are you following him I'll build you a big house I'll make you an organization I'll do this I'll do that don't you realize that's the same thing Cain did amen it was rejected the only thing Cain's offering could in any way represent would be natural works of the flesh well brother you know works of the flesh is good if it's from a born again believer but if it's not what's it worth and we don't believe in works we believe in Fruit works of the flesh can get you in trouble fruits of the spirits what we need am I in the scripture don't you realize that's the same thing Cain did so bring it over here where we are today right here in Lula Georgia Cain built himself an altar made a sacrifice and said it here it is I worship you I believe you there's My Sacrifice there's my altar take it or leave it ain't that something you mean we could be doing that today that's the man today the religious man Esau the same way Esau was a great whole lot better guy than Jacob wasn't he working for his daddy and all kind of things and the church the same way I've done this I've done this I've done this it ain't what you done is what he's done give your heart give him your heart and follow him talking about Lula Georgia brother there what do you want I'm in church ever service I ain't like some of these others that lay out your cter it's Fallen you get it brother Dale I pay my tithe I go to church I believe the message what else do you want he says that's what Cain says said Cain was saying to God take it or leave it you know what God left it we'll give a few more quotes about that but I want you to just read the quotes of what he's talking about I told you I had one or two of these written in my Bible from years back because some people were arguing about Cain and the different things and but then I ran in and just ran in take it or leave it on the computer in the message you do that and you get home look what the next one says this is the mark of the beast and the Seal of God part two 1961 217 E18 now we notice that Cain he he made an altar he put sacrifice on it he got down and confessed his faith in God what be doing away with some of that mean Old Devil you think Cain was and getting down to see and he was a human being one of these days I'm going to get around to preach on that brother Brown said every human being every human being is born with a desire to serve God oh but I didn't think everybody he said everybody was born with that faith in them no that's it well do what you want to he got down and confessed his faith in God and worshiped God in other words just like the religious man today 99 out of 100 almost you to read that 99 out of a 100 almost they say 99 out of 100 says here it is the best that I can do Cain said this I I I built an altar I belong here at the church made a sacrifice this is the best I can do take it or leave it there it is that's just the that's the attitude of people today he said 99 out of 100 I don't believe he meant that well talk to him if you seen him today he'd probably say 99.9 right but look best I can do take it or leave it there it is that's just the attitude of people today I go to church I help them do everything we build a nice building we've done all this and we've done all that and everything I put into the Widow's fund and I do all this there it is the best that I can do take it or leave it but God will leave it he left it there for Cain he will leave it there for you there is a way that seeth right unto a man right but the end thereof is the way of death there's only one provided way for God that's down the bloodstream name to the Holy Spirit without that you're done you're finished you'll never go in look at the next one all the days of our life 1959 612 e19 and he's so much like Cain Cain wanted to be religious he went and made his own religion and when he did he brought it before God with something like this here's the best I got this is all that I can do about it now take it to leave it that's about the way man does today I help build a church I sent my children to church I put my money in every year and that's the best I can do take it or leave it oh see he wants his own way that's the way Cain did but God still loved him right and went after him are you you're reading it what did God tell Cain you do well if you'll just worship like your brother Abel abble come God's way but Cain wanted his way and God says now Cain I've got nothing against you if you'll just come over and go the way that Abel goes you'll do well right now remember this as we get to the next scripture in a second remember what he's saying built the churches put in the money and the best made offerings made sacrifices they doing God even still loved him but he wants his own way that's right now and why would God if it wasn't something wrong why would God speak so much in the word about Cain and the way he spoke of it go ahead and pull up number five Jude 11 Brother Ray said I was giving Jude for John this morning John for Jude so you put it together and get it in the right place judeah 111 woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the heir of balum for reward we know that he got paid he got all these and perished in the gain say in a Kora you remember the gain say of aora we're all spiritual you take too much on yourself Moses we're spiritual also that's right Oh Brother D you're trying to tell us this that we all got to right believe what we want too what is the gain saying or have gone in the way of Cain what is the way of Cain you hear a lot preached about they'll bypass that and they grab into bam and all and G say in the cor you don't hear much mention about oain but we just read from the prophet three quotes about Kan in his ways so the way of Cain is what very religious very good feed the witow US is that kind of what we remember about the Pharisees and the thing who the scripture said is there when the babies was born and you dedicated him brother random listened to him the other day you kind old priest he was comparing the kind old priest to Jesus and Jesus running them out of the temple and the kind old priest and how nice he was the way of Cain the way of Cain is a very good Church person worshiping sacrificing see church if we're coming to church to just keep somebody from beating on us for not coming that's right we might as well quit that's right if all we want is worship and doing good we'll go right over here and we'll send missionaries to the world and we'll shout Glory Hallelujah and we'll have a big time that's the ways of Cain that's right more churches today than ever before and look at the people of this message building million multi-million dollar buildings saying the Lord's coming tomorrow nothing I ain't said a word about nobody got a brand new church it'd be nice if we had one and we could have one if we wanted it but we don't do it okay but could I take this the rest of the afternoon to talk about Cain and his ways but just remember every quote that we've given Cain wound up saying take it or leave it now God left it you mean you want to shout and worship and and run the aisles and and help the food the poor and and do everything Brother D I just know that's the way of Cain right unless you're really truly a born again Christian a born again Christian is a a display of your faith that's right in an outward show of Christianity of the inside right way of can you just think about some of those people and you know you've been around here long enough so don't play games with me I don't play with you okay you know that we're not against anything or anybody but you know yourself there's people right over there in that building as far as what we look at as the uh roots of the spirit will make us ashamed of oursel right don't you know good people out in organized religion that would just that give you anything in the world and do anything in the world for you but you see they think that's what's going to get them to Heaven Cain thought what he was offering was going to get him to heaven or getting back in the garden you know what about it why would God speak of the way of Cain and related in with the way of balam that cursed Israel and all those things for money and doing thing and put it right in with the gains sayings of Kora the Kora stood there and says Moses you take too much on yourself they spelled c r e here with it's k o r a h I think over in the Old Testament and he puts Cain right in there with him what about the next one then 1 John 3:12 why would God say not as Cain who was of that Wicked one well I mean he he was just he was just motivated by the devil and slew his brother pretty bad motivation and wherefore slew he him or in other words why did he kill Abel because his own Works were evil that's right and his brothers righteous that's why he's called a wicked one all right who is that Wicked one 1 John 2:13 I write unto your fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto young men because you have overcome the wicked one so it's easy to know who the wicked one is if somebody's overcome it you know in the Christian Walk The Wicked one is the devil right is any problem with around him when he'd say he said see th Cain was the son of the devil now we know he wasn't a son of the devil if he's anything he's a son of the Beast right what about Jesus in Matthew 13:38 the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the T are the children of the wicked one if that's saying anything at all it's saying they are children of the kingdom and they are children of the devil that's right Jude 1:14 look and Ed Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these things saying behold the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his Saints as I ended up this morning saying where can you find in any lineage of Adam or of Jesus Cain mentioned not in the lineage but because if he was in the lmage he'd have been the eighth from Adam if I can count it read your Bible no see you you would be messing up Enoch you put Cain in there Enoch would have been the eighth from Adam look at Genesis 5 and 1 through three this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day that they were created and Adam lived 130 years and beg got a son in his own likeness after his image and did he call his name Cain or Seth the Abel has no lineage no children so you don't count him in a lineage right Cain had children you counted in a lineage but remember Cain was supposed to been the firstborn the first born was supposed to been the birthright so if there was either one to spiritual of Cain and Abel it was supposed to been Cain because he's the firstborn but Adam had a son finally in his own image and his own likeness called his name Seth remember what I saying the reason he doesn't mention Abel is Abel had no lineage this is the Generations right so the generation of Adam went from Adam who seith right amen Bible proves it's right look in Luke 3 and 37 remember this is going backward now so which was the son of M that's not Matthew lar that's a you I don't which was the son of Enoch which was the son of Jared which was the son of Mel which was the son of Kaa that's not Cain which was the son of Enos which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God no mention and that is the lineage of Jesus right you said it didn't start over no huh come on started over there about David or somewhere and just remember to anybody that don't know it you can't run the lineage of Jesus and bring it down to Jo I mean to Mary it comes to Joseph because the men are the only listing of the lineages just in case somebody come along than you goofing up let you know we do know a little bit but just think about it if I get into the next I ain't going to get nowhere so we'll quit we take that up Wednesday night we're talking about the mark of the beast Wednesday but I just want you to think what we're trying to show using the the Bible to show what God had to say about Cain and remember when the children of Israel went into the promised land who did they meet the Canaanites right see God doesn't speak too good of Cain you know why because he turned God down God offered him salvation right but he wouldn't take it so thereby God could predetermine the line of Cain and the line of Cain would run into some pretty pretty bad lineages well it ain't much worse than going over on the other side though but still it does run it into some pretty bad lineages right would you say brother Dale could we be of Cain or could we be of when we we've got to be from Cain or we've got to be from Abel you know what I mean I mean uh Seth coming from Adam we got to be of one of the two if you want to run your DNA but once you reach the flood what would you do when you only have the sons of Noah you know ham sham and and what about when you get over to Jacob and Esau both Mom and Daddy holy parents but Jacob and Esau saw one seemingly of God the other seemingly of the devil but see Church my whole point of one thing this afternoon is what I said let's don't look back there and see what they done and spend so much time about what they done and proving what they done and running genealogies and Etc you might find out you're on the wrong side that's right well what if you do are you going to let that hinder you if it is then you're going to have to take a lot out of the Bible especially the Gentile bride right come on folks we ain't nothing but Gentiles they don't make no difference who mom and daddy is the Bible says that it'll come a time when they won't say the mom and daddy ate grapes and the children teeths on the edge or something like that paraphrasing it we have to stand alone you know a lot of people think if you was illegitimate that you cannot be saved that's been taught in this message well I don't care to say it everybody I'm looking at or everybody on the internet's hearing this is illegitimate and so am I brother brandham said I've got it laying for the next message he said we were all bastard born hybrid he said I don't care what what is Prophet priest or King but you see we're Gentiles no promise right but oh how wonderful it is to look down through there and see that Rahab the Harlot appear and see Ruth appear see those things start happening but then one day to realize did he come after a gentile bride I'll get back to it in a couple of messages later on or maybe next maybe Wednesday I want to talk about that seed of the woman might find out that's who we are no that was Jesus well I thought we was Miss Jesus I didn't know we was too bad off brother random calls the Jews the remnant of the woman's seed then who's the woman's seed give you that to thank on you see Church ain't but one thing is worth anything and that's Jesus Christ amen no matter what we think of how good we are my family came over on the M flow well Glory Hallelujah mine probably slipped over on a canoe somewhere well what am I concerned about you know Wars are started over people that are trying to Lord over other people or think they're better than other people that's right what about a religious society today and it be right in the middle of the way of Cain that's right am most religious people's ever been make you and I shamed of ourselves in life livings and doings and working for God the way of Kain going to church worshiping singing shouting Hallelujah but I've got some other quotes in there where the Prophet says take it or leave it take it or leave it Cain said now did Cain go before God and say now God dares my offering take it or leave it come on get sensible just for a second I'll quit is that what he said no he didn't say that did he when brother Brandon brought it down to human terminologies that's what he said do you think the denominational churches and you think the followers of this message do you think Lula is trying to be of the devil no people are wanting to worship we're born to worship we're born to sing we're born to worship God go to a country where there's never even heard of the name Jesus and they're out there worshiping God you know those people might be in better shape than we are just remember my point why did God put Cain right in with bam and Kora and why would God say he's of that Wicked one because his deeds was wrong so the best came done was worth nothing brother Dale see folks listen I have one desire that's not to build a church and build a great I have one desire to preach to your soul until that Soul makes a decision for almighty God am but not like brother dick talking about that lady or girl in the Presbyterian said well I never didn't know I was lost something to that degree been in church all my life never know that's lost of a pastor daughter of a pastor never know that's lost come on musicians what do you think of about it come on brother what do you think about it are we saying I believe the message CU remember the quote from the prophet was that Cain knew Abel's message was right because he saw God Vindicated now there's nobody in the world would have argued in the now they will now because of the garbage can but in the times when brother Brandon was standing here there was nobody would challenge his message right no way and he could say if I'm right let God come and he said now if you brothers are right said you get up here and do it right but you know what they wouldn't have nothing to do with that they wouldn't get up and go up there no but then they went out and they had to get oil on their hands and their foreheads they had to get some kind of a workup of a situation and who could deny a lot of them were wonderful people I have one man in mind that people would you call his name and people say oh no it's right but I know some record behind the man that he used to when he leave to go out on the field for an Evangelistic trip he gave his people that went with him so much money to spend on their own needs you know and that money run out he told him you go home do whatever I ain't giving you another dime of God's money there's been great wonderful moves in the religious Realm but could it be the way of Cain keep in mind the prophet said he did worship he did worship God he said I don't doubt you God I believe in you remember Eve was not saying I don't believe in God what about it what do we got brother let's Stand Together 29 in the red book anybody has a need all my freely I will ever all the brothers are getting ready for the communion dud he went to the heard our sister she's speaking for somebody else that's a wonderful thing and you heard her testimony I heard her thoughts of what she believes so we believe with her that all is going to be well and just reach down and touch our buddy Lord in Jesus name anybody else before we go into the communion holy we believe in that some good people there good kids but tell you Bill F father let all be well in Jesus name anybody else savior anybody else before we go into the communion oh to Jesus I Surrender give my St to thee fill me with the power I Surrender get everything right and ready for the communion all All to Jesus I Surrender oh amen we come to this time that musicians can go ahead be seated or go back to your church we come to this time of the communion and we want all things well don't we I don't want to be found falling after Cain I want something from a genuine experience in my heart to love God and let my Works Bea display not to something that I think would get me into heaven being Good's not going to get us into heaven right being good really gets in our way because the Lost are the ones who are more willing to receive Christ those that know they're wrong and people that's been raised all their life in church and doing good so let's just think about it all right let's go into our scripture and just read it 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily E eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest always set in order when I come so let's just have a few moment moment of Silent prayer and just praying one for another and that the Lord would bless and heal the sick among us and deliver and guide each one just have your way Lord in each one of our hearts and lives we commit it to you now in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread has been made for this purpose this afternoon and now as we come together to partake of it we pray that you would just first of all remove all our problems from us the sins of our life the the Disobedience the things Lord that would be a hindrance and make us to be what you want us to be we love you father and we thank you and we commit everything into your hands and we know this is not the body of our Lord and savior this is only an assemble but as we partake of the symbol we thank you for the truth of all things we love you and we just pray that you'd bless sanctify this bread and sanctify the partakers in Jesus name amen what a wonderful opportunity to know the truth there was a time we struggled even over the bread the things you know argued and fussed over what was right and what was wrong on this line or that line just even about the communion the things you know and uh so it's great to know the truth and to know that God is real and his word is real and then none of us are worthy to take the communion we're not the best Among Us is not worthy but he made us worthy he told us to come boldly Before the Throne all right now that doesn't mean well I bless God I'm walking up I'm a Child of God that's not boldly that's stupidity boldness in the scriptural terms of what it's speaking of there is to realize our daddy is inviting us L inviting us to come to a feast what happened in the garden I've tried my best to make it where we'd see it that God never just run off and quit when everything went wrong he was right there right he said I'll go with you we'll get to that where Adam and Eve leaving out of the garden he said said I'll go with you that's something in it father we thank you for this wine It's Made for This purpose and now we ask you to just sanctify the wine and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you and just have your way in our hearts and life we love you and we thank you in Jesus name come morning I walk by the river I'll rest need the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despise and reject and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning our by the river I'll rest NE the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's Glory for me what a time what about how close we are to the end as I said there the other day talking about it like brother Carol said that time he said I'm 80 I think he's 80 or something like that he said the coming of the Lord or either death's going to get me and said both of them's pretty close something to that degree you know because that's true you know we're one breath away from death and yet we live like we got a an eternity to live you know no we don't have that to live we only have what God promised us told him the other day I said I'm already three years into bared time three years is already bared you know well that's wonderful I'm enjoying it myself what because it's it's wonderful to know and realize the truth of God and to be able to see it what a wonderful thing to know God is truth in life brother R said not even to know his word cuz see we can know his word and not know God right we can know about God right without an experience with God that's right that's what we were talking about last night at the Bible study it was brought up I said there's a vast difference between where brother B said you could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a sensation but he never said you could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost without an experience I've never read that one a sensation is a stimulation Upon Our human fleshly beings or parts an experience is something you live through so you can have a sensation and think you're saved right now here's the one thing brother brandham and that's what we ended with last night brother brandham said it used to be that Satan told you you was lost but he said now he tells you you're saved that's a deception right to tell us we're saved if he tells us if he tells you that you're so saved you don't need anything else then I'm going to tell you that's a lie of the devil because the prophet was seeking after God every moment of his life to the day that he died to know more about him let's all partake together you can be seated for a moment we go into John 13 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he went from God and that he was into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and be to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith unto him he that is wash needeth not Sav to wash his feet but is clean ever witht and you you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together just be dismissed sisters can go downstairs father we thank you for this day and we pray that what we've said and talked about has been worthy to you we ask you to just go with with us now as we go into the furtherment of the service and to the foot washing part Lord and just have your way then be with us as we go on our way home give a safe journey Lord be with Brother Dean coming home be with brother Wade coming home be with the others that Lord are having problems and troubles and things and just bless each one we love you and we thank you we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen you're dismissed
