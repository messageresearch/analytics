[11:50] Lord of God we're just so grateful to be
[11:52] able to come together in your presence

[11:55] natural food Lord now I already come and

[12:02] invite you in Lord Jesus that you would
[12:04] come in and itself with us Lord the Lord
[12:06] we're so grateful to you to be able to
[12:09] have something to eat Lord and you said
[12:11] when you were here on earth I am that
[12:13] bread of life that came down from God
[12:15] out of heaven I am that manner and now
[12:17] we have that manna to eat eat from again
[12:20] and this last day that full bread of
[12:22] life without any of man's carnal ideas
[12:25] anything added to it we've got that
[12:28] manner that came down in this last day
[12:30] to fulfill your word now look God I pray
[12:33] Lord that you'll just come among us now
[12:35] Lord Jesus Lord because what kind of
[12:37] service would it be here Lord if if you
[12:39] weren't invited if your spirit wasn't
[12:41] here to quicken the word to make it come
[12:42] alive to us Lord Jesus now could we even
[12:45] approach to understand these mysteries
[12:46] and these things Lord God without you to
[12:49] quicken it Lord to us and so we ask you
[12:51] Lord God to come and feel welcome among
[12:53] us Lord Jesus that we will really have a
[12:55] real church tonight that will really
[12:58] have a see the New Testament really
[13:00] fulfilled in our myths Lord because
[13:02] that's what we're all we're all waiting
[13:04] and looking to see the manifestation of
[13:06] the sons of God now Lord let it come to
[13:08] pass we pray in the name of the Lord
[13:10] Jesus Christ amen now I believe we read
[13:16] this this morning to Revelation 3:20
[13:19] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[13:22] any man hear my voice and open the door
[13:23] I will come in to him and will sup with
[13:26] him and he with me excuse me and then
[13:32] Luke 22 14 kind of goes along with that
[13:35] talking about talking about supping and
[13:39] when the hour was come he sat down and
[13:41] the Twelve Apostles with him starting at
[13:44] verse 14 and he said unto them with
[13:46] desire I have
[13:48] are to eat this Passover with you before
[13:50] I suffer for I say unto you I will not
[13:54] anymore eat thereof until it be
[13:56] fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he
[13:59] took the cup and gave thanks and said
[14:03] take this and divide it among yourselves
[14:08] for I say to you I will not drink of the
[14:12] board of the fruit of the vine until the
[14:14] kingdom of God shall come which means
[14:17] that he embody is about to leave the
[14:20] scene and they didn't know that yet
[14:22] his body's leaving but somebody's gotta
[14:26] fulfill the work and he took bread and
[14:31] gave thanks and brake it and gave unto
[14:35] them saying this is my body which is
[14:38] given for you this do in remembrance of
[14:42] me
[14:42] likewise also the cup after supper
[14:45] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[14:48] my blood which is shed for you the Lord
[14:52] that is blessing to the reading of the
[14:53] word you may be seated this cup is the
[14:58] New Testament in my blood and that
[15:02] symbolize right there at that moment
[15:04] that symbolized kind of a ending to the
[15:08] Old Testament and the beginning of the
[15:11] New Testament and you know that's that
[15:14] what is the difference between the Old
[15:16] Testament and the New Testament that has
[15:17] caused a lot of confusion and a lot of
[15:19] people's minds about the beginning at
[15:21] the end of the Old Testament where
[15:23] exactly that ended I know a lot of times
[15:26] when you know you hear brother Dale or
[15:27] brother Wade or whoever saying that the
[15:30] New Testament began in the book of Acts
[15:32] not the book of Matthew and that begins
[15:35] to cause confusion in people's minds you
[15:38] know you begin to wonder or what or why
[15:41] don't why when I open my Bible does it
[15:43] say in great big old bold words new
[15:45] Testament right before the book of
[15:47] Matthew but yet it said that the book of
[15:50] the New Testament the New Testament
[15:51] begins in the book of Acts and so maybe
[15:54] I want to speak on that this morning
[15:55] because you see the New Testament is
[15:58] supposed to be fulfilled if you if you
[16:00] go back and listen in the
[16:02] into the to the sermon who is this
[16:03] Melchizedek brother Bentham talks about
[16:06] that difference and who fulfilled the
[16:08] Old Testament and who fulfills the New
[16:11] Testament now as Christ don't get me
[16:13] wrong as Christ Christ fulfilling
[16:15] there's nothing that we could do in our
[16:16] own cells of our own works to fulfill
[16:18] anything you can't what make one hair
[16:21] your head white or black or do anything
[16:23] you can't add one stature it's not our
[16:25] works with so many times we think or I'm
[16:27] gonna do this I'm gonna do that but yet
[16:30] it's Christ living on the inside of us
[16:32] so we we want to see III I really want
[16:35] to kind of think about what if the New
[16:38] Testaments gonna be fulfilled by the
[16:39] bride by God living in the bride let's
[16:42] put it like that because Jesus there
[16:44] right there he said I'll not drink of
[16:46] this fruit of the vine until that
[16:49] everything is too fulfilled until the
[16:51] whole plan is is worked out so his body
[16:53] is not here anymore
[16:55] so now he has to use your body he has to
[16:58] use your hands and your eyes and your
[17:01] lips and your feet to move and to do to
[17:04] preach the gospel to live the gospel all
[17:06] of those things and of course that's
[17:09] what I was preaching on this morning is
[17:11] that's what kind of boggles our mind
[17:13] that he would use my hands and my feet
[17:15] and and even after the new birth it
[17:17] begins you kind of stumble over the fact
[17:20] that God Himself is dwelling on the
[17:22] inside of you and it takes a little
[17:24] while to begin to realize that what that
[17:26] means and you know the all of these
[17:29] scriptures all of these things that are
[17:31] in the Bible they testify of something
[17:35] that's got to be fulfilled and there's
[17:36] got to be somebody that can believe it
[17:38] and can receive it and fulfill it and to
[17:42] really like I was talking about this
[17:44] morning to really have an understanding
[17:45] of how it's supposed to work out how it
[17:47] works
[17:48] you must eat from the body flesh of the
[17:51] son of man which is what what Jesus was
[17:54] just doing there as a type in the
[17:57] communion as a type of our fellowship
[18:00] with him we eat the word we the spirit
[18:03] quickens in it and it gives us a
[18:06] stimulation of Revelation I believe in a
[18:09] stimulation of Revelation
[18:11] I believe when you get a revelation it
[18:13] the word live inside of you it'll make
[18:16] it'll make you do more than just hop
[18:18] around a little bit it'll make that word
[18:20] walk and talk with inside of you because
[18:23] it's God living so think about think
[18:25] about that the New Testament you know a
[18:27] lot of times we we kind of get in our
[18:30] here that the the woman is it's kind of
[18:33] something to be looked down on and
[18:35] everything and and you know over the
[18:36] years you've heard preachers preaching
[18:38] down on women and everything but really
[18:40] if you look at it scripturally the Bible
[18:43] God is is is is actually he's putting
[18:46] his glory into the woman and because of
[18:50] that because he puts his glory into the
[18:52] woman he's making her almost appear
[18:55] greater than himself doesn't the Bible
[18:58] say greater works than these shall you
[19:00] do greater works you remember brother
[19:04] Branham always talking about how that
[19:05] you go out in the barnyard and look at
[19:07] the rooster and the rooster looks better
[19:10] it looks it's got all the fancy colors
[19:12] and things than the little hand you know
[19:15] looking at my wife it likes to watch
[19:17] birds and everything and you see a bird
[19:18] come to the feeder and you can tell us
[19:20] whether it's a male or female because
[19:22] the male always looks you know it's full
[19:26] you know the feathers and everything a
[19:28] more colorful and brighter and
[19:29] everything and look at the line with
[19:32] this great big mane and everything and
[19:34] the little the little it's a little wife
[19:36] but yet God seemingly does it in Reverse
[19:39] he comes in humility and meekness and he
[19:43] puts his glory you know even at a
[19:46] wedding you see the man standing up
[19:48] there with his tuxedo and down comes to
[19:51] that down the aisle comes the bride
[19:53] adorned in a white dress she's typing
[19:56] now how she's supposed to be clothed in
[19:58] the word how she's supposed to be coming
[20:00] clothes and virtue with virtue that the
[20:03] groom spiritually speaking the groom has
[20:05] given to her because she has received
[20:08] his word and now she's clothed in the
[20:10] right way and she's veiled because the
[20:12] words got too
[20:13] veiled until it's revealed the word is
[20:16] veiled and she comes down that aisle
[20:20] like as though almost greater than he is
[20:24] but the reason she looks that way and
[20:27] the reason that is is because God has
[20:29] taken his glory his majesty and put it
[20:32] inside of her and so that's what God has
[20:35] done in the New Testament he came down
[20:37] and meekness and humility like the song
[20:40] that we're singing and a manger born in
[20:43] a manger and and then he takes that
[20:45] humility dies on the cross let him let
[20:48] some beat him and and smite him on the
[20:51] cheek spit in his face so that he can
[20:53] put that glory in you and that's what
[20:56] that means
[20:57] when he said take this cup this is the
[21:01] New Testament in my blood I'm gonna put
[21:04] my life inside of you I'm gonna put my
[21:07] life in you and make you something take
[21:10] you from this world that you were in
[21:11] take you out of the thing the car knows
[21:13] the the carnage and the carnality and
[21:16] all the enmity and strife and everything
[21:17] and make something that's glorious and
[21:21] you see that's what that's what God the
[21:23] whole if you go back to Genesis that's
[21:26] where that's where Eve messed up you say
[21:32] maybe maybe another kind of underlying
[21:35] topic I wanna I want to preach on is
[21:37] that is that the God's gonna have
[21:40] something to fulfill his word when the
[21:42] word goes out and it's received and it's
[21:45] received in fertile ground it tilled up
[21:48] ground a good ground ground that can get
[21:51] this going to produce something it will
[21:53] produce if you want to go all the way
[21:56] back God began to speak and he said let
[21:59] there be light and he took the the world
[22:02] through these different stages as he was
[22:05] moving on up let there being when he
[22:06] said let there be let there be light
[22:08] there was light because the word the
[22:11] word spoken is going to manifest now
[22:14] what are you talking about brother Bob
[22:16] I'm talking about all of this the word
[22:18] spoken is gonna manifest the word spoken
[22:20] at the capstone is gonna manifest
[22:22] something if you believe if you receive
[22:24] that son of man revelation it will
[22:25] manifest if
[22:27] so did a good ground it will manifest
[22:28] when God said let there be
[22:30] plant life up from the ground came plant
[22:33] life because it's going to manifest the
[22:35] Word of God will produce it will fulfill
[22:37] when he began to put the Sun and the and
[22:40] the moon into the sky typifying the god
[22:43] and his bride it would manifested and
[22:46] everything began to move exactly in the
[22:48] place and then one day at the
[22:50] culmination he began to speak and he
[22:52] spoke
[22:53] let there be and a man came forth from
[22:56] the earth through time said and his foot
[22:58] was stuck in the ground and we under
[23:00] we've read all those things about how he
[23:02] was that he was made from the dust and
[23:05] then God breathed into his life he put
[23:08] he put a soul into him and then he
[23:09] breathed into him eternal life and gave
[23:12] him eternal life so that he could walk
[23:14] around the garden and God's Word was
[23:17] fulfilled his word was fulfilled that
[23:19] man began to walk around in the garden
[23:21] hey and he asked you know he paraded in
[23:24] front of that man all the different kind
[23:26] of creatures and things what kind of
[23:28] wife would you like to have and do you
[23:31] find a wife in any of these different
[23:32] kind of creatures any of the beasts of
[23:34] the field and all that kind of stuff and
[23:36] he said I can't find anything like that
[23:38] that matches what I am I need I just
[23:42] can't find what I'm looking for you know
[23:45] that that was a voice speaking I don't
[23:48] find something there's something missing
[23:50] here and so God put him to sleep and
[23:52] pulled out of his side took out of his
[23:54] side just like how he does the bride he
[23:57] the bride is created from part of God
[24:00] that's God coming into reality and so so
[24:04] he put him to sleep and and made the
[24:07] woman from that rib of Adam and so then
[24:11] after Adam woke up then he said she is
[24:14] flesh of my flesh bone of my bone the
[24:18] same maker the same thing and he had he
[24:22] had a it's what I'm getting it is the
[24:27] New Testament bride is going to fulfill
[24:29] where Eve lost often where she she
[24:33] couldn't keep going you see when Eve
[24:35] just believed God's Word it just kind of
[24:38] stopped the
[24:40] progress that God was trying to make in
[24:42] her he was trying to fulfill her work
[24:44] then fulfill his word in her what is the
[24:47] woman's purpose the woman's purpose is
[24:50] to receive the word I'm talking
[24:52] spiritual a now to receive the word and
[24:55] produce it to receive it and produce it
[24:57] and so Eve failed to receive the word
[25:00] she failed to go on with it and so she
[25:02] failed to produce it instead of
[25:04] receiving the word she received the eat
[25:07] the devil's lie in the womb of her mind
[25:10] and then it produced in her natural
[25:12] wound you see and that's the same thing
[25:15] that's happening today this happened
[25:17] this for the last all through the seven
[25:19] churches that that people receive the
[25:23] devil's lie in the womb of their mind
[25:25] and it produces something incorrect but
[25:31] what God is trying to do is he's trying
[25:32] to produce a wife he's trying to get his
[25:34] wife into a position well she would
[25:37] receive all of the word and then produce
[25:39] all of the word fulfill all of the word
[25:44] you say will it produce in Matthew 13
[25:47] Jesus said he gave them this parable and
[25:50] he put forth unto them saying the
[25:51] kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of
[25:54] mustard seed a grain an insignificant
[25:56] little grain of mustard seed that you
[25:59] sow into the ground he said which a man
[26:01] took and sowed in his field which indeed
[26:04] is the least of all seeds but when it
[26:06] has grown it is greatest among herbs and
[26:08] becometh the tree so that the birds of
[26:11] the air come and lodge and the branches
[26:12] thereof so if you take this little grain
[26:15] of mustard seed faith that you just
[26:19] start off with because brother Branham
[26:21] said when you get the new birth it's
[26:22] like a little speck of light down on the
[26:24] inside of you a little tiny little speck
[26:26] if you just keep feeding it and let it
[26:28] grow it'll blossom out into a great tree
[26:30] into a great big bride tree and of
[26:34] course we know the story of the bride
[26:35] treat the bride tree was here and down
[26:38] by man's cardinalities by man's ideas
[26:41] say here I go I'm just i'ma throw it out
[26:44] tonight it was it was here down to the
[26:47] stump and the Dark Ages not all the way
[26:50] down down to the stump
[26:52] because the stump is where the life goes
[26:54] in the in the middle of the winter or
[26:55] whatever it runs down into the stump so
[26:58] the stump was always there the
[26:59] foundation the foundation of faith it
[27:03] was cut down all the way to that and and
[27:05] what did they loosen it and they lost
[27:06] the doctrine the bark they lost the leaf
[27:08] sir their fellowship and their their joy
[27:11] and they lost all those things that was
[27:13] hewn down but the Bible says and Joel
[27:16] and I will restore saith the Lord I'm
[27:18] gonna restore this tree all the way back
[27:20] up so that it will be the fulfillment of
[27:23] the New Testament this tree God's
[27:25] fulfilling his life in the New Testament
[27:27] and then you can see the New Testament
[27:28] fulfilled but you know you don't kick
[27:31] you can't really see how the New
[27:32] Testaments gonna be fulfilled
[27:34] until you see how the Old Testament was
[27:36] fulfilled because the Bible runs in
[27:38] cycles it runs in a cycle like this
[27:41] morning we were talking about the three
[27:42] pools how Abraham Noah Moses all of the
[27:45] ones that Brent talked about Jesus their
[27:49] life ran in three pools and so your life
[27:51] is gonna run it in three pools the
[27:52] message running runs in three pools
[27:54] well this Bible runs in cycles and you
[27:56] can see how that you can see the New
[27:59] Testament cycle by looking at the Old
[28:01] Testament cycle how it began how it
[28:03] started and how it ends because you know
[28:05] brother Graham said that even in the Old
[28:07] Testament had seven church ages he
[28:09] didn't lay them out exactly how
[28:11] everything was but the Old Testament
[28:13] ends just like how the New Testament
[28:15] ends the Old Testament ends with a
[28:17] prophet coming on the scenes he
[28:18] introduced what to introduce the Son of
[28:20] Man and he preached a message John the
[28:23] Baptist preached a message to clear the
[28:25] way to make the the high places low and
[28:27] the low places high to clear it way for
[28:30] the introduction of the Son of Man well
[28:32] that's the same thing that's happened in
[28:34] the New Testament in the New Testament
[28:35] God's Word is being fulfilled and he a
[28:38] prophet comes upon the scene and he
[28:40] preaches a message to get everything
[28:41] ready to make the way clear for the for
[28:46] for the son of man but in this case the
[28:48] son of man is not going to be an
[28:50] individual it's going to be a New
[28:52] Testament fulfilling God in his bride
[28:56] fulfilling the New Testament hey you
[28:59] know you think about this morning now
[29:00] you say that the the son of man was put
[29:02] out of the church and we all may be
[29:04] maybe there's some of the young ones or
[29:06] whatever get in there mind that the son
[29:08] of man has put out of the church and it
[29:09] looks like an actual man standing there
[29:12] with with a robe on and a crown like
[29:14] that painting was painted but what it is
[29:17] is when the Son of Man is put out of the
[29:19] church
[29:19] it's those ideas that I that they put
[29:23] him out because they accept their
[29:24] carnality their carnal ideas and the way
[29:27] that their their tradition of the elders
[29:28] the tradition of their church and they
[29:31] put out the revelation of the Son of Man
[29:33] but the revelation of the Son of Man
[29:36] will be accepted by the bride because
[29:37] she is the new Testament fulfilled and
[29:43] I'm kind of really honestly this this
[29:45] evening I'm kind of mixing up a lot of
[29:47] different sermons that brother Branham
[29:48] preached like the token and who is this
[29:51] milk is a dick and Christ the mystery of
[29:53] God revealed because to really see the
[29:57] New Testament it involves it involves
[30:00] blood it involves something Christ did
[30:04] and so you know when Eve there when she
[30:08] when she just believed God's Word the
[30:10] remedy for that was a blood offering and
[30:14] we're talking about a token now just so
[30:16] you can follow me their token the token
[30:19] was given a token offering the token was
[30:22] the blood and in the Old Testament that
[30:24] token was the chemical makeup of the
[30:26] blood the chemist the chemistry where
[30:28] you can see when they left the Garden of
[30:30] Eden they were covered by that blood but
[30:32] the life in that blood could not come
[30:34] back up on the believer because it was
[30:36] it didn't have a soul there was no soul
[30:38] to come back on the believer and and
[30:40] accomplish the redemptive purpose but in
[30:43] the New Testament there is a token where
[30:45] the life can actually come back on the
[30:47] believer and that life that token has to
[30:49] be applied when the children of Israel
[30:51] were leaving Egypt that token had to be
[30:53] over the door it had to be it had to be
[30:55] visible so that so that anybody could
[30:57] see it and that's the same way with you
[30:59] and I we cannot just just put this
[31:01] message kind of over here or whatever we
[31:03] we actually have to eat it just like
[31:06] they ate it and then it becomes lived in
[31:08] us and you can see that blood speaking
[31:11] out through your life and you become a
[31:13] lived
[31:14] and then that token identifies you
[31:16] because the token is over you the token
[31:18] is as it represents the the payment
[31:22] already made it represents that death no
[31:24] more has a prior no more has any
[31:28] anything to do with you let's put it
[31:31] like that yeah death death has been
[31:35] defeated death has been conquered and so
[31:38] so in Jesus when he think about this now
[31:42] he said this cup is the New Testament in
[31:45] my blood and he gave that then to them
[31:48] as a representative of the blood that he
[31:50] was about to shed that night on the next
[31:53] day the next morning on the cross as
[31:55] they took him that night and his life
[31:59] would be shared but it's not the
[32:01] chemical that saves you it's the life
[32:03] that he shared the life that comes back
[32:05] inside of the believer that tokin life
[32:08] has to be represented in you and that is
[32:10] the New Testament fulfilled let's look
[32:19] at the Old Testament here I know I'm
[32:22] sometimes it gets a little bit confusing
[32:25] when you start talking about a lot of
[32:26] different things and mixing things I'm
[32:28] thinking think about now I'm mixing up
[32:30] who who was this milk isn't it
[32:32] who is this milk you know brother Brian
[32:33] priest who is no kids Deckard I forget
[32:35] the exact name of the title and then
[32:37] later on he preached who is this milk is
[32:39] a dead now now you've got a Melchizedek
[32:42] in the Old Testament and there's no kids
[32:45] that reveals himself again in the New
[32:46] Testament and really the only way that
[32:49] you can know who is this milk is a dick
[32:51] because something I can tell you who is
[32:53] this milk you take some I can't you know
[32:55] you know tell you what the message says
[32:58] and everything but I do you really know
[33:00] who is this Melchizedek the only way
[33:02] that you can know is to go on the same
[33:04] journey that that Melchizedek went and
[33:06] to experience that same thing and have
[33:08] his life living inside of you that takes
[33:11] you on that journey so let's take that
[33:13] journey now now in the Old Testament
[33:15] Adam and Eve walking in the Garden of
[33:17] Eden they were veiled behind this you
[33:19] kind of glory they were veiled behind
[33:21] the word and so the word all
[33:23] brother I'm talked to over and over the
[33:24] interval many many times about how the
[33:27] word has got to be veiled it's veiled
[33:29] and so they were the living word walking
[33:32] through the Garden of Eden and then then
[33:34] when they stepped out from behind that
[33:36] and accepted a lie then that veil was
[33:40] lifted you see and all of a sudden they
[33:42] realized that they were naked and and so
[33:45] you know the the word is always veiled
[33:48] when when Abraham met Melchizedek and
[33:51] paid tithes in him and it says that Levi
[33:53] paid tithes even while he was still in
[33:54] the loins of Abraham he paid tithes to
[33:56] Melchizedek God that was God veiled in
[33:59] flesh he was veiled behind a human flesh
[34:02] God Himself walking in that man and when
[34:06] he left the scene he did this you know
[34:07] that the body that he had just went back
[34:09] to the elements or whatever but yet that
[34:11] was God Himself tabernacling inside of
[34:14] human flesh and he was veiled he was
[34:16] veiled in the behind the holy of holies
[34:20] back there with that pillar of fire came
[34:21] down where the word was he was veiled
[34:24] and didn't then one day he became veiled
[34:26] in human flesh and he went and died for
[34:30] you and I and died on the cross and gave
[34:32] up his life and went through the journey
[34:34] of that you and I you and I must take of
[34:38] death to self death burial and
[34:41] resurrection the journey that we also
[34:45] must go through where you die to
[34:47] yourself you die to your own desires you
[34:50] go down in the grave and you come up
[34:52] again a new person which is why we go
[34:55] when we baptized somebody we read that
[34:58] scripture that just as Jesus was died
[35:01] and went down into the grave and rose up
[35:03] so we burry this person in water as a
[35:05] type of that but really what's happening
[35:07] is when you get born again that's why I
[35:09] don't believe it like the Baptist said
[35:11] just believe and make it a decision but
[35:13] I believe that when you come to the Lord
[35:15] and he births himself into you it is a
[35:17] birth you are dying out and something a
[35:20] resurrected life is coming out but but
[35:23] but what about what about these other
[35:27] journeys all of this is a dying out to
[35:31] yourself I dine out until finally the
[35:34] word is
[35:35] because this is all a birth and finally
[35:38] the word is born in you just like it was
[35:40] when when just there at the very end of
[35:43] the Old Testament when when the angel
[35:46] came to Mary and told her that she was
[35:48] gonna have this child this child the son
[35:52] of man he was going to come into being
[35:54] and the angel told her and she said be
[35:58] it unto me according to thy word and
[36:00] marrying a brother around this is
[36:01] another thing that's always confused
[36:03] people that that that brother Branham
[36:05] talked to Mary as the carrier she just
[36:08] carried him but then the word was born
[36:10] the son of man was born she carried the
[36:14] word just like he came through a lot of
[36:17] the denominations she carried as he was
[36:20] carried along but then at the end he was
[36:22] born the son of man was born and you can
[36:26] see the son of man walking around veiled
[36:28] in human flesh and they didn't recognize
[36:30] him they didn't recognize God veiled any
[36:33] human flesh but he was there to do what
[36:38] to fulfill the Old Testament to fill
[36:41] fulfill all the things in the Old
[36:42] Testament that had been prophesied about
[36:44] him because all of those prophecies
[36:47] about he would be born in Bethlehem and
[36:49] how he would be born of a virgin and all
[36:52] those things when he was there and
[36:54] fulfilled
[36:54] everything that people had pondered
[36:56] about about who who would be who who
[36:59] would this person be that would give
[37:01] birth to him and He fulfilled over 400
[37:04] Old Testament prophecies in the Old
[37:06] Testament until when he got to the River
[37:09] Jordan he told John in Matthew 3:14 this
[37:12] is John forbade him saying I have need
[37:14] to be baptized of thee and comes down to
[37:16] me and Jesus answering said unto them
[37:18] suffer it to be so now for thus it
[37:20] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[37:22] a little bit of the righteousness a
[37:24] little bit of the rightness note
[37:26] everything everything that was
[37:28] prophesied of him in the Old Testament
[37:29] he was gonna fulfill he was gonna make
[37:32] it live another way to saying and so
[37:36] within it then it says and then he
[37:38] suffered him and he he knew he knew who
[37:41] he was and so he knew the role that he
[37:43] had to fulfill and that's why when that
[37:46] Sarah Phoenician woman called him thou
[37:47] son of David
[37:48] he didn't answer her he said he answered
[37:51] her not because he knew he was he knew
[37:54] the dispensation in the hour that he was
[37:55] living in that he didn't it wasn't time
[37:57] for the son of David to be fulfilled it
[37:59] was the time for the Son of Man to be
[38:01] fulfilled and so and all these other
[38:06] scriptures like Matthew 5:7 - 1718 this
[38:09] says and think not that I am come to
[38:10] destroy the law or the prophets I am not
[38:13] come to destroy but to fulfill for
[38:16] verily I say unto you till heaven and
[38:18] earth pass one jot or one tittle shall
[38:20] in no wise pass from the law till all be
[38:22] fulfilled and then Luke 1250 but I have
[38:25] a baptism to be baptized with and how am
[38:28] i straight until it be accomplished his
[38:30] baptism being his death he had something
[38:32] that he was supposed to do to be
[38:34] fulfilled and in Matthew 26 that where
[38:37] it says then it came to pass when Jesus
[38:38] had finished all these sayings he said
[38:41] unto his disciples you know that after
[38:43] two days is the Feast of the Passover
[38:44] and the Son of Man is betrayed to be
[38:47] crucified and I just want you to think
[38:50] is I know maybe this could this it can
[38:54] be a little bit tiring as I listen to
[38:56] all the scriptures and things quoted
[38:57] rattled off but think about this now the
[39:00] Word of God received into your heart
[39:02] will produce something it will predict
[39:06] it will bring forth something if you
[39:08] open up your heart and I believe in this
[39:11] hour we should be opening up to the
[39:12] point where we just spend practically
[39:14] all of our time in it and I don't want
[39:16] to overly burden anybody but I believe
[39:18] now is the time to be feasting on the
[39:20] body word of the son of man and to be
[39:22] dedicating our whole if that if this is
[39:24] what's gonna change us then what else do
[39:27] I have to occupy my time with I
[39:29] certainly don't need to be occupying my
[39:31] time with the movies and TV shows and
[39:32] that kind of thing that's not gonna
[39:34] change me all that will do is take me
[39:35] down into the ground and so what we
[39:38] should be doing is giving our whole
[39:39] being our whole effort everything to be
[39:41] consecrated to be completely given over
[39:44] to the eating this body word and so so
[39:48] one of the things that Jesus did was as
[39:50] he was fulfilling the word as he was
[39:53] showing that what had been planted by
[39:56] the prophets all down through the ages
[39:57] he was now the fulfillment of that he
[40:00] began to sow also
[40:02] he began to sue and the Bible says that
[40:06] and he spake many things unto them and
[40:08] this this is Matthew 13 and he spake
[40:10] many things unto them in parables saying
[40:12] behold a sower went forth to sow of
[40:14] course they didn't understand who the
[40:16] sower was but he later explained to them
[40:18] that this sower was the son of man this
[40:21] man right here who was veiled in flesh
[40:24] this sower began to sow and for
[40:27] three-and-a-half years he began to speak
[40:29] and he began to sow words what was he so
[40:32] and he was sowing you and I because one
[40:35] day you would hear the words that he
[40:37] sowed not the exact words not that
[40:40] through his same vocal cords but you
[40:42] would receive it and you would be the
[40:44] manifestation of those words that he
[40:46] spoke spake during that three and a half
[40:48] years now how does that how do those
[40:50] words get to you they've been passed
[40:52] down through generations to generation
[40:55] written on pages preached and preached
[40:57] preached by the gospel until they
[41:00] finally make their way to you but all of
[41:02] these words all of this the true
[41:03] preaching of the gospel came from this
[41:05] sowing of the Son of Man the Son of man
[41:07] showed you he sowed you because it says
[41:10] the sower went forth to sow and when he
[41:12] sowed some seeds fell by the way side
[41:14] and the fowls came and devoured him up
[41:16] some fell upon stony places where they
[41:19] had not much earth and forthwith they
[41:21] sprung up because they had no deepness
[41:22] of earth and when the Sun was up they
[41:25] were scorched and because they had no
[41:27] root they withered away and some fell
[41:29] among thorns and the thorns sprung up
[41:31] and choked them but other fell into good
[41:33] ground good ground and brought forth
[41:36] fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold
[41:40] some thirtyfold who hath ears to hear
[41:43] let him hear
[41:45] and so the amount of the of the fruit
[41:48] that is born depends on how much you
[41:51] blend it with with carnal ideas because
[41:54] down brother Branham explains it I'll
[41:57] read this in a second you can see how
[41:59] they're through through the different
[42:01] church ages these the Catholic system
[42:04] and the Methodist system and all of that
[42:06] choked out the word so that it couldn't
[42:08] bring forth as much as it should it
[42:11] couldn't bring forth but now in this age
[42:13] we're supposed to be bringing forth a
[42:15] hundredfold
[42:16] a hundredfold is the full word where
[42:19] where you can understand like I said
[42:21] this morning you could understand from
[42:23] Genesis to Revelation
[42:24] there should be no none of man's idea
[42:28] well the green is being baked out now
[42:30] there might still be some of man's ideas
[42:33] left but it's being baked out and the
[42:35] shuck is pulling away until all this
[42:37] left is that corn of wheat the corn of
[42:39] wheat the original corn of wheat that
[42:41] was sown back here in the first church
[42:44] age which was the son of man cuz the son
[42:47] of man was sown and the son of man sowed
[42:50] the son of man was playing him and the
[42:52] son of man is gonna come up in this last
[42:54] day and so you see two cycles there two
[42:58] cycles that in the end of the Old
[42:59] Testament age the son of man would
[43:01] fulfill all the Old Testament Scriptures
[43:03] but in the end of the Old Testament age
[43:06] the Son of Man would be back again to
[43:09] fulfill all of the New Testament
[43:11] Scriptures and how is he going to do it
[43:13] is he gonna do it by coming himself in
[43:15] bodily flesh no he's gonna use your
[43:18] flesh that's why brother Brennan said
[43:20] that he's looking for somebody who he
[43:22] can get inside of that he could use
[43:24] their mouth that he can use their hands
[43:26] and feet and walk through and talk
[43:27] through he's looking for somebody that
[43:29] will give themselves completely over to
[43:31] God some people will give themselves a
[43:34] little bit partly to God and they you
[43:36] know honestly they can't quite make it
[43:38] up here they can't quite make it up
[43:40] because they can't get moved pastors
[43:43] additions can't move past maybe their
[43:45] laziness can't move past there their
[43:48] desire for for just slacking off or
[43:51] whatever but uh let's be honest here now
[43:55] but a real true cause if you want to eat
[43:57] the body were the son of man you can't
[44:00] you can't just lay around and expect
[44:02] somebody to spoon feed it to you you got
[44:04] to go digging for it yourself like that
[44:06] that I believe that was a vision that
[44:08] brother Branham had one of the the seven
[44:10] or so visions that kind of led up to the
[44:11] seals and in one of those that he maybe
[44:16] it was a dream he dreamed that there
[44:17] were cows or some sort of animal on the
[44:19] side and they were they were digging in
[44:21] that grass trying to find that food and
[44:24] he said the interpretation of that was
[44:26] it's
[44:26] hard to get that food and you have to go
[44:28] finding it sometimes and you have to get
[44:30] into this message and really go hunting
[44:32] and finding and seek him to figure out
[44:34] what is what is the revelation of who is
[44:37] this Melchizedek is what that preacher
[44:39] man is saying is that true is he telling
[44:42] me the right thing or am I just going to
[44:44] say well I don't believe that I'm just
[44:46] going about my business yeah but you see
[44:49] that's that's that's the way a real true
[44:52] New Testament believer I believe is
[44:54] gonna do is it's gonna search the
[44:56] scripture daily like the brands and find
[44:59] out whether the three things that are
[45:00] preached about are true or not let me
[45:07] see if I can read that that quote this
[45:10] is in wisdom versus space and I don't
[45:12] think I gave this to you brother sorry I
[45:14] I added some between services wisdom
[45:18] versus faith he said notice he said some
[45:20] went forth went to seed when the scene
[45:22] went forth preached the word some fell
[45:25] by the wayside just like water on a
[45:27] duck's back runs off some fell upon
[45:29] rocky ground stony it had just little
[45:31] dust that blowed up there and sprung up
[45:33] but it didn't have no roots no place to
[45:34] put its roots now I'm going to make
[45:36] illustrations here and I hope I don't
[45:38] hurt no feelings see that was the
[45:40] Catholic Church they said they was built
[45:43] on a rock I agree with him I'll sure
[45:45] will agree with him that's right no
[45:46] earth under it at all no water on it to
[45:48] grow from why it couldn't produce they
[45:51] couldn't produce a Bible vitamin because
[45:53] they don't even believe in it their
[45:54] doctrine is dogmas that's right Roman
[45:56] Dogma no word in it at all see fell upon
[45:59] rocks that was a super wisdom old
[46:02] brother I'm telling you they had it in a
[46:04] super way they presented in a way of
[46:05] psychology and great big buildings and
[46:07] find risks look like holy gods of
[46:10] priests and everything else that's the
[46:12] one that fell upon rocks just so little
[46:14] of soul till the thing couldn't grow it
[46:16] died then that was super wisdom then
[46:18] some fell on the Protestants ground but
[46:21] after a while the great wisdom of the
[46:22] big denominations choked it out choke
[46:25] the spirit out days of miracles has
[46:27] passed dr. so-and-so said so and so see
[46:30] no such a thing
[46:31] just perfect choked all choked all the
[46:34] what out choked out the spirit for the
[46:36] wisdom see the Holy Spirit fell and the
[46:39] days of Martin
[46:40] Luther the Holy Spirit fell in the days
[46:42] of John Wesley the Holy Spirit fell on
[46:44] the days of the early Pentecostal church
[46:46] but what's the denominations done with
[46:48] their wisdom have choked it out choked
[46:50] out what the seed what is the seed the
[46:53] word it doesn't mean that it means this
[46:56] there see see how it does when you begin
[47:00] to question and say it doesn't mean that
[47:02] then then it prevents it does just like
[47:05] you did it prevents the Word of God from
[47:07] being fulfilled but if you open up your
[47:09] heart and say it does mean that he's
[47:11] still Jehovah Jireh he's still able to
[47:13] provide he's still my healer he's able
[47:15] to heal my brother Graham said talking
[47:18] about I'm gonna jump back to that sermon
[47:20] from this morning he said if you've got
[47:22] the key of faith to open up the door
[47:24] then it'll unlock all of sickness all of
[47:27] the any kind of illness he ran through
[47:30] there was a quote I meant to read this
[47:32] morning where he ran through all the
[47:33] different kind of things if they like
[47:35] it'll unlock and when you get that door
[47:37] that key or the door of a son of man
[47:39] it'll unlock all of these things I
[47:41] believe I believe that's where we're
[47:44] coming so - so brother Branham so Jesus
[47:55] went through went through this journey
[47:58] that the believer has to be identified
[48:01] with he went through the journey of
[48:04] going down to the cross and and and
[48:05] dying and rising again and then you
[48:08] could see the resurrection come to live
[48:09] inside of him but what is it the
[48:11] believer to believe her today the New
[48:13] Testament or the believer all down
[48:15] through the New Testament is the
[48:17] fulfillment of Scripture the fulfillment
[48:20] of all the things that had been spoken
[48:21] of beginning I'm trying to get some of
[48:27] the scripture so when Jesus was about to
[48:32] go off the scene he told them in John 14
[48:34] 12 verse 12 through 18 he said verily
[48:37] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[48:40] on me the works that I do shall he do
[48:42] also and greater works than these shall
[48:45] he do because I go unto my father and
[48:47] you know that's maybe sometimes hard for
[48:51] us to understand greater works greater
[48:53] not
[48:54] not fancier or more magnificent works of
[48:57] with more fireworks or anything but
[48:59] greater because now he's putting that
[49:00] same life that was in one man inside of
[49:03] a group of believers that are scattered
[49:05] around the world and you look at this in
[49:08] the same way that maybe you can go back
[49:10] to some of these Old Testament stories
[49:11] of like Elijah and Elijah where Elijah
[49:15] when he was called by Elijah he was
[49:17] plowing that twelfth mute that twelve
[49:19] oxen and and Elijah Elijah cast his
[49:24] mantle on him he puts his mantle on him
[49:30] and it's like a token to him their
[49:34] anointing of the Holy Spirit falls upon
[49:36] him so you can see at the beginning of
[49:38] the church age God gives he puts his
[49:40] beginning of the church ages he puts his
[49:43] life inside of the believers he gives
[49:45] them a token in the message the token
[49:47] brother Graham said the token was given
[49:49] on the day of Pentecost but later on he
[49:52] says the token could not come until this
[49:54] day
[49:55] that sounds very confusing what does he
[49:57] mean when the token could not come until
[49:59] this day because that you've got this
[50:01] the same kind of cycle that was revealed
[50:03] in the life of Elijah and Elijah Elijah
[50:06] had a mantle cast on him when he was
[50:08] first called when he was first called
[50:10] but then you wait till the end of the
[50:12] road after he's going through Gilgal and
[50:15] Bethel and a gill gal the school of the
[50:19] prophets and Bethel and then as they
[50:21] after he watches Elijah who types Jesus
[50:24] cross over the River Jordan cross over
[50:26] death and and ascend up into the heavens
[50:28] on the fiery chariot then that mantle
[50:31] falls back on him and so you have two it
[50:34] looks like two instances of the mantle
[50:36] falling and after that mantle fell the
[50:38] second time he was able he went back to
[50:41] the River Jordan which types death and
[50:42] he said where is the god of Elijah where
[50:46] is that god of Elijah and any part of
[50:48] the Jordan River parted and he went over
[50:50] on dry ground so that Lamb when Jesus
[50:54] paid the price he paid the price so that
[50:56] that token could be could represent to
[50:59] you it would
[50:59] any evidence to you that death had been
[51:02] conquered that the price had been paid
[51:04] when you get the new birth that token is
[51:06] the evidence to you that the price has
[51:08] been paid but God this last days gives
[51:11] and not another token like a token of
[51:15] brother branham Carla the true baptism
[51:17] of the Holy Spirit something that the
[51:20] church has been waiting on for 2,000
[51:22] years what is it and not another spirit
[51:25] what it what is adoption it's not
[51:27] something else but it's more of the same
[51:30] it's more revelation and the true
[51:33] baptism of the Holy Spirit is more of
[51:36] the same it's more of that second that
[51:38] same spirit that was given onto the
[51:40] church at the day of Pentecost God said
[51:43] his church in spirit in this last day to
[51:45] restore back to us to faith the original
[51:48] faith of the Pentecostal fathers and put
[51:50] that same that st. the same virtues to
[51:53] say the same way that they walked and
[51:55] talked and put that same power back into
[51:58] the church and then to give a true
[52:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost the true
[52:02] baptism of the Holy Spirit which is what
[52:04] he called the token and he said in
[52:09] Exodus 12 and the blood shall be to you
[52:11] for a token upon the houses wonder if I
[52:15] should start reading quotes here where
[52:17] you are and when I see the blood when I
[52:19] see the Blood I will pass over you and
[52:21] the plague shall not be upon you to
[52:24] destroy you when I smite the land of
[52:26] Egypt the plague shall not be upon you
[52:28] and so the token is a type it's an
[52:31] evidence that death has been defeated
[52:32] because the plague will not be upon you
[52:34] they were down there in there in Egypt
[52:36] when the when the token was applied over
[52:39] the door of their of their of their half
[52:41] of their home and the death Ames and
[52:44] went by on the outside and and they
[52:46] could listen to the howls and the
[52:47] screams and everything and they knew
[52:48] that death could not touch them there
[52:50] now think about this true baptism of the
[52:53] Holy Spirit will be an evidence to you
[52:55] as it comes upon all believers that
[52:57] death cannot teach you that you have a
[52:59] way of escape a way of escape has been
[53:02] prepared for you that revelation 4:1
[53:04] door a door is open in heaven so you can
[53:07] get out of here they give
[53:09] confidence that you don't have to go
[53:11] through the tribulation because you've
[53:12] already been sanctified
[53:14] you've already been washing that what
[53:16] was revealed under the sixth seal that
[53:17] you've the churches the bride has
[53:19] already been sanctified she don't have
[53:21] to go through the tribulation she has a
[53:23] way out a way of deliverance and you see
[53:25] that's what that's what is revealed
[53:27] under the seals that God has paid the
[53:29] price for you that the blood is a
[53:32] covenant to you that that the token has
[53:34] been applied and by applied I don't mean
[53:36] like in the Old Testament that where
[53:38] they would take a little piece of hyssop
[53:39] and and wipe it over the door but in
[53:41] this day it's applied so that it's
[53:43] visible and by applying it you apply it
[53:46] by faith this is just as they applied it
[53:48] by faith back then but applying it by
[53:51] faith makes it applied to your life it
[53:54] makes it work through you do you see
[53:57] what I'm saying and it becomes the voice
[54:00] of fulfillment where the New Testament
[54:02] the New Testament in my blood is what
[54:04] Jesus said the New Testament is
[54:06] fulfilled in you let me read some quotes
[54:09] we're winding I'm not gonna keep
[54:12] everybody long to this evening so don't
[54:14] get worried
[54:16] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:18] and forever number one if y'all could
[54:20] pull that out brothers he's talking
[54:26] about the children of Israel in Egypt
[54:27] and he said the other day I happened to
[54:29] hit something that sounded profound to
[54:31] me and it's very seldom I ever hit
[54:33] anything that I make anything out of but
[54:35] I was thinking just before I reach down
[54:37] to this what I'm going to try to say to
[54:39] you I was thinking of Israel down in
[54:41] Egypt and they were slaves and yet they
[54:43] were children of God we all know the
[54:44] story and yet if they throw them moldy
[54:47] bread they had to eat it if they
[54:48] ravished their daughters if they killed
[54:50] their sons or whatever they did it was
[54:51] just done they were slaves and yet them
[54:54] were the chosen elected of God with a
[54:57] promise waiting until the time of
[54:59] fulfillment and they were waiting for
[55:01] the time of fulfillment for the time of
[55:04] deliverance to come because they knew
[55:05] that God would send them a deliverer
[55:07] they just had to wait for her and so now
[55:10] now we're waiting for the promise we've
[55:12] been waiting for the promise but now
[55:14] that time of fulfillment is at hand and
[55:16] we know that because brother Brown the
[55:18] message of the hour identified and he
[55:20] said it's adoption time it's
[55:22] time it's time to turn the corner all
[55:24] those things now is the time the time of
[55:26] the film fulfillment and see then he
[55:28] goes on to say now that's what's the
[55:30] matter with the Pentecostals today they
[55:31] don't recognize that the time is here
[55:33] the time has come God's promised to be
[55:36] fulfilled
[55:38] let's keep reading on let's go read and
[55:41] sirs we will see Jesus number two he
[55:43] said all the Old Testament teachings
[55:45] pointed to a messiah that was coming and
[55:47] all the Old Testament characters
[55:49] represented this Messiah until it was
[55:51] fulfilled in a man fulfilled in that man
[55:54] Christ Jesus God veiled in flesh I'm not
[55:57] reading again I just want to point that
[55:59] out for anybody listening I that would
[56:01] that wasn't what brother Branham said
[56:03] I'm throwing my own David crying over
[56:07] the Jerusalem after he had been refused
[56:09] rejected King eight hundred years from
[56:11] there the son of David said on the same
[56:12] Mountain rejected King by his own people
[56:15] and wept over Jerusalem Jerusalem to her
[56:17] Jerusalem Josefa borne sung among
[56:20] brothers other brothers that was a
[56:23] peculiar birth and he was born to be a
[56:25] seer he dreamed dreams and seen visions
[56:27] and so forth and he was hated by his
[56:29] brethren to typify the very day we're
[56:31] living in now and there his brethren was
[56:34] great men the patriarchs so you could
[56:36] see all of these things that happened
[56:37] the Old Testament were types and shadows
[56:39] of something that would take place that
[56:42] would actually take place just like how
[56:44] Enoch Enoch took went and walked with
[56:46] God and he is a type of the believer
[56:48] today a type of the believer you are the
[56:51] fulfillment of that time you you are the
[56:54] fulfillment of Enoch not the other way
[56:56] around
[56:56] all these Old Testament prophecies and
[56:59] even the New Testament prophecies things
[57:00] that were spoken of are now being
[57:03] fulfilled in that day and you are the
[57:05] fulfillment of that let's read number
[57:12] five they identified masterpiece of God
[57:14] he said he came to reflect the father
[57:17] and the father was the word hey man now
[57:19] I feel real religious he came to reflect
[57:22] the father's word God said he would be
[57:24] there and there he was the perfect
[57:25] masterpiece of God's great handiwork oh
[57:28] my he was the perfect reflection of him
[57:31] he reflected everything that God had
[57:33] spoke of he reflected what
[57:35] adam said about him he reflected about
[57:37] all the prophets said about all the
[57:39] patriarchs said everything that he said
[57:41] he was the fulfillment of that word all
[57:44] types was fulfilled in him and let's get
[57:46] down to 170 no off the church today
[57:48] could just reflect that first church
[57:51] when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[57:53] Pentecost
[57:54] if the Christian today could reflect we
[57:57] are a hybrid Bunch to what they were
[58:00] because you see if you can reflect what
[58:03] that first church could what that first
[58:05] church did right here then you are
[58:09] candidate for the capstone to come down
[58:12] does everybody understand that
[58:15] was in that first church age and that
[58:17] first church age they had all of these
[58:19] virtues I've got a quote where brother
[58:20] brems said they had all of these virtues
[58:22] but yet one thing that was lacking was
[58:23] this capstone they had all these virtues
[58:26] but they didn't have that that that
[58:28] headship they didn't have that
[58:30] understanding of who the son of man was
[58:33] and all that was encompassed in that
[58:35] which is revealed in the seven seals and
[58:37] that's what the seven seals is is a very
[58:41] special thing for us today
[58:43] well you begin to when you begin to peer
[58:45] into the seven seals and it begins to
[58:47] open up to you it's something that was
[58:49] hidden even from Paul and I rhiness and
[58:52] all the ones that have gone before us
[58:53] but now we have an opportunity to look
[58:56] into that and peer into that that those
[58:59] deep mysteries revelations and yet we
[59:02] leave it on our shelf and getting
[59:04] covered over by dust brother Graham said
[59:12] in the token let's go to number nine he
[59:17] said now the Spirit is the token you
[59:20] shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not
[59:22] many days hence and when the blood was
[59:24] shared the token was sent down on the
[59:25] day of Pentecost like a mighty rushing
[59:28] wind now let's go to number ten let's
[59:31] kind of go quick here in the token again
[59:34] he said there you are the blood the
[59:36] blood the token not the blood chemistry
[59:38] but the token the Holy Ghost the life
[59:40] out of the blood that comes what does
[59:42] that life do what
[59:43] what does that life does comes and
[59:46] confirms what the token has been
[59:48] purchased for the token confirms what
[59:51] the blood bought for you the blood
[59:52] purchased your Redemption the token is
[59:55] an evidence of it the blood he was
[59:57] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[59:59] for our iniquity chastisement of our
[1:00:01] peace upon him with His stripes we were
[1:00:04] healed see all blood blood blood then
[1:00:07] when the token comes it shows that
[1:00:09] you've been identified with that
[1:00:11] sacrifice amen the devil can't keep you
[1:00:14] from it and how are you identified with
[1:00:16] that sacrifice is that you went through
[1:00:19] the same process he went through three
[1:00:21] pools and you go through three pools you
[1:00:24] go through that same journey and what I
[1:00:26] mean by three pools is that he changes
[1:00:28] your soul he redeemed he's redeemed he
[1:00:31] paid the pool for a purchase price for
[1:00:33] redemption on the cross but you have to
[1:00:36] go through a process where it is made
[1:00:38] manifest in you and we're full
[1:00:41] redemption has made manifest to you and
[1:00:43] that's called full Redemption full
[1:00:45] Redemption not just not just for your
[1:00:47] soul but for your spirit and for your
[1:00:51] body the entire package and that process
[1:00:54] is the same process that all of the the
[1:00:57] others you know kind of went through my
[1:01:03] brother Brown said in the unveiling of
[1:01:04] God number eleven he said and when you
[1:01:06] see the word made manifest you see the
[1:01:09] Father God because the word is the
[1:01:11] father the word is God and the word made
[1:01:14] manifest is God Himself taking his own
[1:01:17] word and manifesting it among believers
[1:01:21] he takes his word puts his life inside
[1:01:25] of you quick as that word makes it
[1:01:27] manifest then you're identified with
[1:01:30] that and then you can see that token on
[1:01:32] you you can see it because it's visible
[1:01:34] it's visible to God and it's visible to
[1:01:37] your fellow man and so that gives you an
[1:01:40] assurance that the death that price has
[1:01:42] been paid that the price for you for
[1:01:46] your Redemption has been paid in the
[1:01:50] statute of a perfect man number 12
[1:01:51] brother Branham said I can imagine them
[1:01:54] apostles never acted like us they went
[1:01:56] around probably
[1:01:57] a few words till they got in the pulpit
[1:01:59] they walked in and they doing what they
[1:02:00] were supposed to do and walked out yes
[1:02:03] sir they had power they had virtue they
[1:02:06] had no arguments with men they know
[1:02:08] where they stood that's all they knowed
[1:02:10] who they believed they kept on walking
[1:02:12] in the spirit doing only just as I said
[1:02:15] the other night one little nod that's
[1:02:17] all God had to do then nothing going to
[1:02:19] stop them they didn't question and study
[1:02:21] and Hum halt and worry like we do
[1:02:23] whether they should do this or that they
[1:02:25] went ahead and done it anyhow just one
[1:02:27] little nod from God that done it just as
[1:02:29] soon why how could they know it was a
[1:02:31] nod from God they had all these virtues
[1:02:34] in here all these qualifications and the
[1:02:37] first little nod of God compared with
[1:02:38] every bit of this and with his word they
[1:02:41] knowed it was the Word of God in a way
[1:02:43] they went didn't have to worry about
[1:02:45] nothing else when God spoke they went
[1:02:47] and because of that they were the living
[1:02:50] fulfillment of the New Testament their
[1:02:52] will for the fulfillment of the New
[1:02:54] Testament in their day and every age had
[1:02:57] somebody to live and fulfill the word
[1:02:59] for their day and this day it will be no
[1:03:01] different it will have someone to accept
[1:03:03] and receive that word and fulfill it and
[1:03:05] make it live
[1:03:22] well I don't know what's going on with
[1:03:24] my news let's a MUX it got stapled
[1:03:26] together somehow anyway we'll just keep
[1:03:28] carrying on and so you can see you can
[1:03:37] see the prophecy being fulfilled and
[1:03:39] prophecy was fulfilled just as it was
[1:03:41] fulfilled in Jesus it's been fulfilled
[1:03:44] in the bride it's being fulfilled right
[1:03:45] now because we're living out the
[1:03:48] scripture the scripture is being made
[1:03:49] alive in the believer as we receive the
[1:03:52] word we become the word and so that's
[1:03:54] how if you want to see manifested sons
[1:03:55] of God manifested sons of the sons of
[1:03:58] God become manifested as they receive
[1:04:00] the word they perceive the word and then
[1:04:03] then they become the word and they
[1:04:04] become the manifestation of their our
[1:04:10] and so now in this last day this work
[1:04:14] there's a lot of scriptures that need to
[1:04:15] be fulfilled and one of them was Malachi
[1:04:17] 4:5 six behold I will send you Elijah
[1:04:19] the Prophet before the coming of the
[1:04:21] Great and dreadful day of the Lord and
[1:04:23] he shall turn the heart of the father's
[1:04:25] to the children and the heart of the
[1:04:26] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:04:27] and smite the earth with a curse and so
[1:04:30] you and I are the fulfillment of that as
[1:04:32] we receive the message of this day we
[1:04:35] become we we that we have received the
[1:04:40] token message and that brings the true
[1:04:42] baptism of the holy spirit and unlocks
[1:04:45] the seventh seal book to bring
[1:04:46] resurrection faith it unlocks the secret
[1:04:49] to bring redemption of the body because
[1:04:52] the Bible says in first Corinthians
[1:04:53] chapter 15 that that the last enemy that
[1:04:56] shall be destroyed is death so if we're
[1:05:00] you can see all of these scriptures
[1:05:01] being fulfilled leading up to this last
[1:05:04] thing that must be fulfilled that
[1:05:06] there's got to be somebody like Elijah
[1:05:08] to receive the word for his day to
[1:05:10] receive his Elijah and then walk over
[1:05:14] Jordan just like Elijah did to look at
[1:05:17] to look at what Jesus did and look at
[1:05:18] the the journey that he took and mirror
[1:05:21] that journey and then to be able to pass
[1:05:24] over death to be able to conquer death
[1:05:26] that where our bodies can be changed the
[1:05:29] last enemy to be conquered is death and
[1:05:31] it will be fulfilled because God will
[1:05:33] have somebody on earth to fulfill him
[1:05:37] the larger in in second Kings chapter to
[1:05:41] 13 to 14 it says he took up also the
[1:05:44] mantle of Elijah that fell from him and
[1:05:46] went back and stood by the bank of
[1:05:50] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[1:05:52] that fell from him and smoke the waters
[1:05:55] and said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[1:05:57] and when he also had smitten the waters
[1:06:00] they parted hither and thither and
[1:06:02] Elijah went over why because he had gone
[1:06:05] he had gone past the school of the
[1:06:07] prophets he had took he had gone on a
[1:06:09] journey he had gone on his old 3-pole
[1:06:12] journey you remember brother Branham
[1:06:13] explaining that from a lot from from
[1:06:17] Gilgal he started off justification went
[1:06:20] through the school of the prophets went
[1:06:22] on to the Jordan River which is death a
[1:06:24] type of death and then you come forth in
[1:06:26] a resurrection because he ever believer
[1:06:28] every believer that comes through this
[1:06:30] token message has got to go through that
[1:06:32] same journey of death burial and
[1:06:35] resurrection that's what that's what
[1:06:37] King tried to circumvent he tried to he
[1:06:39] went and took instead of taking doing
[1:06:41] like like Abel did and taking a bloody
[1:06:44] sacrifice and bringing that and laying
[1:06:46] it before the Lord he went and gathered
[1:06:48] from the field the first fruits which
[1:06:51] bypasses if you look at all the
[1:06:52] different feasts the Passover and the
[1:06:55] feast of unleavened bread he he skipped
[1:06:58] right over those feasts and went to the
[1:07:00] feast of firstfruits he went straight to
[1:07:03] the resurrection without a death in a
[1:07:05] burrow and you can't have a resurrection
[1:07:08] without a death and a burial you've got
[1:07:10] to go through that process and so every
[1:07:13] believer comes through this same process
[1:07:14] you that's why if you want to see what
[1:07:17] you're fulfilling today go back in the
[1:07:19] Old Testament and follow that pattern
[1:07:20] and look at that cycle the two cycles of
[1:07:23] the Old Testament being fulfilled ending
[1:07:25] with the coming with the Son of Man and
[1:07:26] the New Testament ending with the coming
[1:07:28] of the Son of Man we're at the end of
[1:07:31] this second cycle and it's got to be
[1:07:33] fulfilled I'm right around in an hour so
[1:07:36] let's go ahead and I'm gonna close up
[1:07:37] right now and the musicians you can go
[1:07:39] ahead and come and we'll close up
[1:07:41] because see the blood the blood must be
[1:07:45] applied and it was a token for a and for
[1:07:49] it was a token for Adam and Eve as they
[1:07:52] walked out of the garden that the price
[1:07:54] had been paid it was a token for the
[1:07:56] children of Israel in Egypt and it'll be
[1:07:58] a token for you in this day when by
[1:08:01] receiving the word for your day it
[1:08:02] becomes alive in you and the word
[1:08:05] revealed produces the life of Christ the
[1:08:08] true baptism of the Holy Spirit the true
[1:08:11] life of Christ in u.s. a token and
[1:08:13] evidence that you have passed from death
[1:08:16] in the life you know how brother branham
[1:08:18] said that there'll be many it's
[1:08:20] happening right now many are coming to
[1:08:22] the to the adoption but the whole church
[1:08:24] has got to come true the whole bride has
[1:08:26] got to come to an adoption but if
[1:08:29] someone comes to it to the adoption
[1:08:31] comes to that place and yet they go down
[1:08:34] and in the ground like brother Branham
[1:08:36] did because the whole church as a whole
[1:08:38] has not come to the pull to that place
[1:08:40] yet he said in the token messages it
[1:08:43] said it's an evidence to you that you're
[1:08:45] gonna come up in the resurrection
[1:08:47] it's that evidence to you because that
[1:08:49] the price has been paid it's you can
[1:08:51] have confidence in there you can you and
[1:08:55] what gives you confidence as you can see
[1:08:57] the life of Christ it may manifest in
[1:09:00] you and that gives you confidence amen
[1:09:03] you coming up brother I'm running out of
[1:09:08] things to say all right go ahead
