[11:02] watch in their home we love you and we
[11:04] thank you
[11:05] we commit it all to you now in jesus
[11:07] name amen
[11:10] revelations 1
[11:12] and then revelations 12.
[11:17] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[11:19] gave unto him
[11:21] to show into his servants things which
[11:23] must shortly come to pass
[11:25] and he said and signified it by his
[11:27] angel and to his servant john
[11:30] who by record of the word of god and the
[11:32] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[11:34] things that he saw
[11:35] blessed is it he that readeth and they
[11:37] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[11:39] keep those things which are written
[11:41] they're in
[11:42] well for the time is at hand
[11:45] and
[11:46] now let's go over to revelations 12
[11:49] and we'll just read
[11:51] the first four verses and i hope we get
[11:53] over there
[11:55] i want to finish up revelation 11 but
[11:57] we'll read in revelations 12
[11:59] verse 1 through 4.
[12:01] now appeared a great wonder in heaven a
[12:03] woman clothed with the sun and the moon
[12:05] under her feet
[12:07] and upon her head a crown of 12 stars
[12:10] and she being with child
[12:12] cried travailing in birth and pain to be
[12:15] delivered and there appeared another
[12:17] wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[12:19] dragon having seven horns seven heads
[12:22] and ten horns and seven crowns up on his
[12:25] heads
[12:27] and his tail drew the third part of the
[12:28] stars of heaven and then cast him to the
[12:31] earth and the dragon stood before the
[12:33] woman which was ready to be delivered
[12:35] for her divine her child as soon as it
[12:38] was born you may be seated the lord had
[12:41] his blessing to the
[12:43] reading of the word
[12:46] now i hope you enjoyed the brother there
[12:48] sunday afternoon i really enjoyed his
[12:51] message you know
[12:53] i hope you did
[12:55] because that's what we want it to be for
[12:56] you to help you you know
[12:58] because i get my health too from the
[13:00] five full ministry and i believe in it
[13:03] now
[13:05] uh sunday morning there i only got part
[13:07] of what i was wanting to bring out but
[13:10] you know i decided not to take a another
[13:12] whole message
[13:14] on revelations 11 but to just do a
[13:16] little back up on it
[13:18] and then continue into chapter 12
[13:22] and maybe that way we can can see
[13:25] you know a little more about it but you
[13:26] remember we were talking in in chapter
[13:28] 11 about
[13:30] the two olive trees
[13:33] and the two candlesticks
[13:36] you know
[13:37] standing before the god of the earth
[13:40] well then we got over into zechariah
[13:44] and we found that there was one olive
[13:46] tree i mean one candlestick
[13:49] and it was a seven golden candlestick
[13:51] and
[13:52] and the oil was pouring in from the
[13:54] olive oil you know to light the candles
[13:57] and do the things and i hope he was
[14:00] enjoying that part i did because
[14:02] thinking on it you know as
[14:04] the uh
[14:05] in the old testament it was looking
[14:07] forward
[14:09] so zechariah was looking forward to
[14:11] seeing the seven church ages and the
[14:14] candlesticks and the things and the
[14:16] olive trees and it would be then the old
[14:19] and the new testament i gave you those
[14:20] things
[14:21] that would represent you know the olive
[14:24] trees and the things in the pouring of
[14:26] the oil then when it would come on over
[14:28] into
[14:30] the book of revelations
[14:32] that you would see two olive trees and
[14:34] two candlesticks because you wouldn't be
[14:37] dealing there with
[14:39] the uh
[14:40] the church ages but you'd be looking
[14:42] back
[14:44] and you could see that there was seven
[14:47] candlestick form in the old testament
[14:50] and then there were seven in the new you
[14:52] know because that would cover the two
[14:54] and that would give the old and the new
[14:55] testament has to be in the candlesticks
[14:59] and then we seen that it was moses and
[15:01] elijah
[15:03] that was standing there
[15:05] to to bring the message
[15:07] you know and it would prove out to be
[15:09] the second coming of jesus christ
[15:11] through matthew
[15:12] there on the mount so you know tying
[15:15] that part together i'm just trying to
[15:16] take
[15:17] uh these things now and just
[15:20] run through them a little to help us to
[15:22] understand a lot of these symbols
[15:26] that you know
[15:28] are there in the scriptures
[15:30] that we look at and say well what does
[15:31] this mean and what does that mean now
[15:34] you know somewhere in here if you see
[15:35] something you want us to emphasize a
[15:37] little or remember how you say those
[15:39] words you know speak a little extra on
[15:41] it write us a question we'll try to
[15:44] cover those things
[15:46] and help us to see it
[15:48] but we just got part of chapter 11
[15:52] because the part i wanted to bring out
[15:55] was
[15:55] you know coming down to work
[15:58] that if if you pull that up with us read
[16:00] the scriptures
[16:01] in chapter 11 then we'll go on and
[16:03] finish up into
[16:05] chapter
[16:06] 12 and get started on him
[16:10] because revelations 11 6 through 14
[16:13] says these have power to shut heaven now
[16:15] this is the two
[16:18] you know
[16:20] two olive trees moses and elijah
[16:22] in the tribulation after the rapture of
[16:25] the bride
[16:26] this is to israel the calling out of the
[16:28] 144 thousand and it's like i told you
[16:30] i'll keep repeating this
[16:32] once you go through that seals
[16:36] then basically what you're looking at is
[16:39] israel in the tribulation
[16:42] no
[16:42] now we'll see tonight you got to back up
[16:45] and pick up some things it's like we did
[16:47] sunday with with the uh zechariah to
[16:50] back up and pick up
[16:52] to see what that would be and compare
[16:54] but you know mainly you're looking at
[16:57] the calling out of israel
[16:59] this is after the rapture of the church
[17:01] because she's done gone you know all
[17:02] right
[17:03] they have power to turn the water to
[17:05] blood and it's not the earth would
[17:07] all plagues as often as they will
[17:09] and when they shall i finish their
[17:11] testimony
[17:14] the beast that sent us out of the
[17:15] bottomless pit she'll make war against
[17:17] them and shall overcome them and kill
[17:20] them
[17:21] they're going to kill those two
[17:22] witnesses all right
[17:24] and their dead bodies run around said
[17:26] one time said see they won't even allow
[17:28] them to bury them
[17:30] is it their dead body shall lie in the
[17:32] street of the great city which
[17:33] spiritually is called
[17:34] sodom and egypt
[17:37] where also our lord jesus was crucified
[17:40] okay where's that jerusalem all right
[17:44] and they are the people in kindreds and
[17:45] tongues and nations shall see their dead
[17:47] bodies three days and a half
[17:50] and shall not suffer their dead bodies
[17:52] to be put in graves
[17:53] and now watch what they do
[17:56] they they dwell upon the earth shall
[17:58] rejoice over them what about somebody
[18:00] killing somebody
[18:02] i mean can you think about it in any
[18:05] form
[18:07] i mean any form of religion
[18:12] or would there be any form of religion
[18:16] that
[18:17] you could understand that no matter what
[18:19] you are
[18:20] buddha hindu methodist baptist
[18:22] presbyterian catholics or whatever
[18:25] brown amounts or whatever in the world
[18:28] how could it be that you could rejoice
[18:29] over somebody being killed
[18:33] and you claim to be religious
[18:39] now what kind of a spirit would that be
[18:46] see those those jews they have no uh
[18:50] um
[18:52] feelings you
[18:54] know
[18:56] see they was ready to kill they they
[18:58] killed a lot of them they killed a lot
[18:59] of the christians
[19:02] the jews did you know because and they
[19:04] killed jesus christ why because he's
[19:06] done good
[19:08] now what kind of a religious
[19:11] form of
[19:15] salvations or whatever you would want to
[19:17] talk about
[19:20] where could you have anything like that
[19:21] that you'd want to kill somebody
[19:25] and yet it says here that they rejoice
[19:27] over the fact that
[19:28] those two witnesses are killed
[19:34] do you know they said it was said of
[19:35] some people like the
[19:37] and die
[19:38] got killed
[19:40] that our enemy is now dead
[19:45] now what kind of a religion would you
[19:47] have
[19:49] who would want
[19:51] any form
[19:53] of a
[19:55] religion
[19:57] that would even consider
[20:01] the fact of killing somebody and it'd be
[20:03] okay
[20:09] you don't think like that i mean you
[20:10] don't read your bible thinking about
[20:12] a horrible situation that's in
[20:17] and oh no they wouldn't rejoice over
[20:22] they didn't put it in the newspapers and
[20:24] blast it to the world when brother brown
[20:26] got killed and
[20:29] but i wonder how many would
[20:32] kind of sneaker up their sleeves even if
[20:34] some of us
[20:37] sarcastic old goatee granddaddy
[20:39] preachers
[20:41] that stood with this message
[20:44] if we pass off the scene
[20:48] but i just wonder what kind of a
[20:50] religion you have
[20:52] i don't want it i'm just honest
[20:54] a religion that would allow you to kill
[20:57] somebody in the name of your god
[21:00] you say without brother dale god killed
[21:02] people
[21:04] okay
[21:07] he told them to kill people
[21:10] okay
[21:11] but now where's the new testament for
[21:15] remember that's the way you separate
[21:18] the old in the new testament right
[21:21] in the old testament they would kill for
[21:23] what they believed
[21:25] in the new testament you're not supposed
[21:26] to kill for what you believe
[21:29] it would prove you wasn't in the new
[21:31] testament
[21:34] so anybody would rejoice over the death
[21:36] of anyone else because if they differed
[21:38] with them
[21:39] then
[21:39] i don't believe they've got any
[21:41] salvation
[21:44] well you have no right i don't care
[21:45] about what you think of my right is i'm
[21:48] killing what i think
[21:50] what do you think
[21:51] you think it's all right to go out and
[21:53] kill people because they're different
[21:54] with you
[21:57] well why does people kill you with their
[21:58] words
[22:00] we'll get off of that
[22:03] but listen
[22:05] they that dwell upon the earth
[22:09] will rejoice
[22:16] make mary send gifts one to another
[22:19] because the two prophets these two
[22:21] prophets tormented them that dwell on
[22:23] the
[22:24] earth but you know what now watch from
[22:27] here
[22:28] to here
[22:30] and going on down all right
[22:34] and after three days and a half
[22:37] the spirit of life of god from god
[22:40] entered into them and they stood up on
[22:42] their feet and great fear fell upon them
[22:44] which saw them
[22:46] oh yeah
[22:49] and they heard a great voice from heaven
[22:51] sailing to them coming here
[22:53] that's ended up in the heaven and a
[22:54] cloud and their enemies beheld them
[22:56] and let's see them right
[22:59] now and they're going to change their
[23:01] ideas
[23:03] in the same hour there was a great
[23:04] earthquake in the 10th part of the city
[23:06] fell in the earthquake there's a slain
[23:07] of men
[23:08] seven thousand and the remnant were
[23:10] frighted and gave glory to god
[23:13] to the god of heaven
[23:18] up here you're saying kill them
[23:24] but now you're afraid
[23:27] you see that's where we're brought
[23:28] around people run their mouths but they
[23:30] wouldn't run them while he was alive
[23:33] they were under their mouth now about
[23:34] all this at the other but
[23:38] what would happen for him to stand back
[23:40] there
[23:45] you think you changed people's ways of
[23:47] doing
[23:51] well
[23:54] i remember in the old testament that
[23:55] nature and waves are worth it
[24:00] one day earth swallowed up i believe it
[24:02] was 250 preachers
[24:09] and the next day the people came to
[24:11] moses and you know what they said
[24:14] you killed the people of god
[24:18] most honest i've always been
[24:20] i hope i'm a christian
[24:22] it would have been tempting even as a
[24:24] christian to just back up and say god
[24:25] you just take care of it i'm not gonna
[24:27] have anything to do but i don't remember
[24:29] but but this is getting to be awful mess
[24:32] you better believe i'd remind them every
[24:34] day
[24:37] for the 40 years they was in a
[24:38] wilderness journey
[24:41] you know
[24:42] every day somebody come up and said boys
[24:44] get mad i say shut up you're the one who
[24:46] brought this
[24:49] you the costume
[24:53] and ain't being hateful and don't want
[24:54] to kill nobody we just won't tell it
[24:56] like it is
[24:59] but you look now
[25:00] look at verse four eleven
[25:02] verse fourteen
[25:05] put it back up right here
[25:10] now remember this is in the tribulation
[25:12] period right
[25:14] and we're talking about it see it says
[25:16] and the second woe is christ
[25:19] and behold the third
[25:22] woe cometh quickly
[25:26] now in revelations
[25:29] 6
[25:31] 13 i believe it is
[25:33] it says there's three woes or 8 13
[25:35] somewhere in there
[25:37] all right
[25:39] revelations 9 and 12 it says that woe
[25:43] number one
[25:45] is taking place
[25:49] here we read in
[25:51] 11th chapter 14 verses the second woe
[25:54] was passed
[25:57] all right
[25:59] now
[26:00] we don't have to worry about what they
[26:02] are because we know what the prophet
[26:04] said go to number two
[26:10] this is the third angel's message to the
[26:12] world i won't deal with that now the
[26:15] third angel that'll be another message
[26:16] later on 14th chapter i think
[26:20] and you know what the third angel's
[26:21] message
[26:24] is going forward now in this day
[26:27] now we'll get down to that when we do it
[26:29] this is the flying of the third angel
[26:32] message
[26:33] if you're a bible reader see that was
[26:35] during his time i'll get back to that in
[26:37] the scripture
[26:38] there were three wolves followed it
[26:42] first one happened in world war one
[26:44] second one out of world war ii
[26:46] you know what
[26:47] we're going in now all right we're at
[26:49] the end of the road all right
[26:52] so
[26:53] world war one
[26:56] was woe number one
[26:58] world war ii
[27:00] was woe number two and
[27:02] world war ii
[27:05] preceded or came before
[27:08] the tribulation period and that's why
[27:10] when it got down to the scripture there
[27:12] and the second woe was passed
[27:17] because you're already into the
[27:18] tribulation
[27:20] with the two witnesses world war ii it
[27:22] done ended back in the 40s there all
[27:24] right
[27:26] but think about it
[27:32] why would you want to be so religious
[27:36] until you want to kill and do different
[27:37] things
[27:43] he goes on down true
[27:45] we won't get back into it we'll just
[27:46] jump over to the 12th chapter because i
[27:48] just want to bring those couple of
[27:50] little points with the 11th chapter
[27:52] now let's go into the
[27:55] to the
[27:57] revelations
[28:00] 12. if you can pull that up brother then
[28:03] we'll read this
[28:04] a little bit and then we'll get started
[28:06] on it
[28:07] they don't have that one actually wrote
[28:09] down for
[28:10] for doings for revelations 12.
[28:13] but i want to just get a point now and
[28:15] we'll get started on revelation 12. i
[28:17] just wanted to finish that up
[28:18] of revelations 11.
[28:21] no
[28:22] and there appeared a great wonder in
[28:24] heaven
[28:26] a woman clothed with the sun and the
[28:28] moon under her feet
[28:29] and upon her head a crown of 12 stars
[28:32] and she being with child cried
[28:34] travailing in birth and pain to be
[28:36] delivered
[28:37] there appeared another wonder in heaven
[28:38] and behold a great red dragon having
[28:40] seven heads and ten horns and seven
[28:43] crowns upon his head
[28:45] heads
[28:46] and his tail drew the third part of the
[28:48] stars of heaven and then cast them to
[28:50] the earth and the dragon stood before
[28:52] the woman which was ready to be
[28:54] delivered
[28:54] parted over her child as soon as it was
[28:57] born all right so now you're back into
[29:00] what you're looking at is what we
[29:03] we we're calling when we're in the seal
[29:05] book
[29:07] is going through the
[29:09] the
[29:10] things in the bible are the symbols
[29:12] but letting the prophet
[29:15] tell us these symbols
[29:18] or if you read scofield and he has some
[29:20] good points upon
[29:22] the line of these things and in his
[29:25] footnotes
[29:26] and bringing it out
[29:28] but there's no way he could tie together
[29:31] the points that the prophet of god would
[29:33] put in there
[29:36] because we look at this and we think
[29:38] about this as being
[29:41] and wondering where it took place
[29:44] all right
[29:45] and we'll prove in a moment that this
[29:47] was when
[29:48] jesus christ was born
[29:51] all right
[29:55] but now you've got some things as said
[29:57] by the prophet that it's very confusing
[29:59] and i've got to bring that point to be
[30:01] able to drop back up on the other
[30:04] so look at number three on your notes
[30:06] and look at the surprising thing
[30:08] of when he says revelations 12
[30:11] is to take place
[30:12] if you can't see a compound meaning
[30:16] for scriptures
[30:18] then
[30:19] it doesn't make no difference you
[30:20] understand the symbols
[30:24] if you don't understand the meaning go
[30:26] ahead number three
[30:28] this is the future home paragraph 48
[30:30] verse 15.
[30:32] later on the lord willing
[30:34] we come into the twelfth seasons are not
[30:37] pardon me the twelfth chapter of
[30:39] revelation which lays between the coming
[30:42] of the lord
[30:44] and the ending of the trumpets
[30:47] all right
[30:51] now to take that statement by itself
[30:55] you would be telling the truth
[31:07] if you would say this was jesus christ
[31:09] being born
[31:10] but see it's a double meaning a compound
[31:13] meaning
[31:14] scriptures have compound meanings to
[31:16] them and wrote around these called a
[31:17] compound revelation one time
[31:20] but compound meanings
[31:23] in other words it can be saying one
[31:25] thing and have actually two meanings to
[31:27] that
[31:29] that won't be true
[31:30] meanings like uh
[31:32] white dog black dog
[31:37] you know
[31:39] they'll both tie together
[31:43] and make a beautiful picture once you
[31:45] see it
[31:49] see you've got to remember now this is
[31:50] what we're looking at the prophet would
[31:52] say then the prophet is going to come
[31:54] and say this is jesus christ
[31:58] see no wonder people can't understand
[32:00] brother branham
[32:03] you know
[32:05] because like i said any doctrine that
[32:07] you've got any thoughts you have
[32:11] any doctrinal idea or thought you have
[32:15] you name it and i can give you a quote
[32:16] that sounds contrary
[32:22] but i don't believe it's contrary
[32:26] now we're not talking about a white
[32:27] horse rider in a
[32:29] situation like that that's the prophet
[32:31] said he was wrong
[32:33] and he corrected
[32:39] but i'm talking about where he'll say
[32:40] that that baptism of the holy ghost is
[32:43] the new birth
[32:45] placing you in the body of christ
[32:50] giving you eternal life
[32:54] and in a minute he'll say
[33:00] you need eternal life
[33:03] you just got
[33:05] to sanctification or something
[33:09] you say i can prove that the new birth
[33:11] is
[33:14] believing on the lord jesus christ
[33:22] now i'm just making the points because
[33:24] the point is forget you to say something
[33:30] the message is not that confused
[33:33] it's our confusion
[33:36] that's right now like i said oral
[33:37] roberts university you could ask me and
[33:40] what did brother branham say about
[33:42] revelations 12.
[33:47] and they said well we've got this quote
[33:49] and we got these quotes
[33:51] so it looks like he is confused
[33:54] well that's pretty well the way the
[33:56] people are the messages isn't it
[33:59] they say well which one do you want you
[34:01] know
[34:05] and people have become so
[34:07] uh religiously revelated you call it not
[34:09] holy ghost but religiously
[34:12] until any time you say something they've
[34:14] automatically got that other quote
[34:18] you know pop them at you like popcorn
[34:22] i say what about this
[34:25] what about it
[34:29] well it sounds different from what this
[34:31] says
[34:32] but no it's not different
[34:36] the light just ain't shined on the
[34:37] subject yet
[34:39] for you to understand it that's right
[34:43] all right you you get the point there's
[34:45] worth now you don't matter what you
[34:47] think about me anyway about what i say i
[34:48] am because i ain't nothing anyway
[34:50] but that's where your teacher comes in
[34:52] to take the two sides and put them
[34:54] together right right
[34:59] because the others will just take it and
[35:01] run this away they'll run that away and
[35:03] hit and miss and up and down but a real
[35:06] true teacher he'll take that and
[35:08] ponder over it until he can see it come
[35:10] together right now
[35:14] and we can see then what paul would say
[35:17] looking like to those people
[35:21] that
[35:22] you know
[35:23] you're justified by faith
[35:26] well james would come along and it
[35:28] sounds like to most people's thinking
[35:31] that james says you're justifiable works
[35:37] and you know what both of them's right
[35:39] right
[35:41] but if it ain't put together you sure
[35:43] got a lot of
[35:44] problems
[35:46] right
[35:49] because we're born again by faith but
[35:51] then our works must follow our faith
[35:53] and if works don't father there's no
[35:55] faith
[35:57] so they're both saying the same thing
[36:01] you guys work right around said then it
[36:02] takes somebody to sit down and look at
[36:05] something until it'll come together
[36:10] and then you can see well hey
[36:13] there was right
[36:15] revelations 12 happens between
[36:18] the the
[36:20] you know
[36:21] the coming of the lord
[36:22] and the ending of the trumpets
[36:28] and that's
[36:29] going over that away still yet
[36:33] what
[36:36] but then when you look at revelations 12
[36:40] you say
[36:43] i don't understand that because of what
[36:44] this says
[36:47] all right
[36:48] so let's take it a little bit you'll see
[36:50] that it'll come together
[36:54] revelation 12 would be israel right
[36:59] not the bribe she's gone in the rapture
[37:03] revelation 12 would be israel
[37:06] all right
[37:07] so now watch it deal with israel
[37:10] in what we read in the scriptures
[37:12] and there appeared a great wonder in
[37:13] heaven a woman clove of the sun and the
[37:16] moon under her feet
[37:18] and upon her head a crown
[37:20] of 12 stars
[37:24] and she being with child
[37:27] cried travailing in birth
[37:29] and pain to be delivered
[37:36] now watch what he says these things are
[37:38] so let's go to number four
[37:42] this is a message mark of the beast 54
[37:44] 513
[37:45] i grabbed 130 and 131 too big
[37:50] now watch him describe he's talking
[37:51] about revelations 12.
[37:53] look the moon under her feet
[37:56] the sun in her head the moon under her
[37:58] feet
[37:59] the sun was the dispensation of grace
[38:05] and the moon was the dispensation of law
[38:11] now that's describing those two things
[38:13] and what it is you know the moon and the
[38:14] stars
[38:16] the woman was the orthodox church
[38:20] and she was standing over the law
[38:23] which is israel the old testament
[38:26] the orthodox israel the old testament
[38:29] all right
[38:31] and she was standing over the law the
[38:33] law was passing away
[38:38] because the law was a shatter of good
[38:40] things to come is that right
[38:42] the moon is only a shadow of the sun
[38:44] reflecting on the moon is that right
[38:47] making the moon and the law was under
[38:49] her feet
[38:51] she done lived through that day
[38:56] he said notice how she's dressed
[38:59] look
[39:00] and the church
[39:02] is crowned with the doctrine
[39:05] of the 12 apostles
[39:07] and look what he says that is and under
[39:09] her feet and upon her head a crowd of 12
[39:12] stars
[39:16] see the old testament gave not only
[39:18] birth to jesus christ
[39:23] it gave birth to the word
[39:25] which was jesus christ
[39:28] right
[39:30] all right
[39:31] now giving birth to the word then the
[39:33] twelve apostles would come in
[39:39] one day
[39:40] i've got a message one of these days i
[39:42] told my wife and aaron about it the
[39:44] other day and i never told anybody
[39:46] only those two people
[39:49] and when they said i'll get back and
[39:50] preach on it
[39:52] because we've totally left out a lot of
[39:54] things about israel
[39:56] that needs to be covered
[39:59] and i'll get back to it when i get more
[40:01] over into whatever or whenever it comes
[40:03] up
[40:04] but look
[40:06] and she being with child controversy
[40:09] birth and pain to be delivered that was
[40:11] the orthodox church
[40:16] the old testament now what's going on
[40:20] the orthodox church is standing there
[40:22] the sun shining down the doctrine
[40:25] of the twelve apostles
[40:28] you realize those twelve apostles
[40:32] is the crown of the
[40:34] old testament
[40:36] law
[40:40] them and their message they brought
[40:42] their doctrine
[40:46] came from the old testament
[40:50] that's why paul would take the book of
[40:51] hebrews and tie it together
[40:55] and give you the symbols and the ways
[40:57] the thing read the book of hebrews
[41:00] no
[41:02] watch what he said saying now
[41:05] with the moon under her feet below
[41:07] the shadow of things to come the gospel
[41:09] light shining now
[41:11] the law faded away when the sun came up
[41:14] come out all right now watch what he's
[41:16] talking about she was pain to be
[41:18] delivered and she brought forth a man
[41:21] child
[41:23] which was christ jesus
[41:29] and he was caught up to god
[41:32] put it soon here it is as soon as the
[41:34] dragon verse 4 i believe it is 3 4
[41:39] which was natural rome
[41:46] now hold on what you're talking about
[41:51] it's not the catholic church that come
[41:53] into being yet
[41:56] we've got to get down to where we can
[41:57] cover the powerful rome becoming pagan
[42:00] rome becoming papal rome when we get
[42:02] time
[42:05] but you see
[42:07] who was the fellow that wanted to kill
[42:08] jesus when he was born
[42:12] not
[42:13] pilate
[42:16] herod
[42:18] because they was looking for a king
[42:21] right
[42:22] herod was overroam right
[42:27] then pagan rome will become palpa wrong
[42:30] all right
[42:32] she was praying to be delivered see what
[42:34] you're doing is a compound meaning
[42:39] see
[42:40] they gave birth to jesus christ
[42:44] all right
[42:46] now when it comes to the end time
[42:51] because i tried to cover the other day
[42:52] on the feast of the trumpets were
[42:54] that
[42:56] leviticus 16 was a killing
[43:00] but leviticus 23 is a mourning for the
[43:03] kill
[43:07] see israel is going to give birth
[43:15] we've got to give birth
[43:18] so now you got three meanings
[43:21] to coming forth
[43:27] come on follow with me what i'm saying
[43:30] here it is as soon as the dragon which
[43:32] was the devil saw the woman ready to be
[43:34] delivered
[43:36] he stood right by her the virus child as
[43:38] soon as it was born
[43:42] and when jesus was born the roman
[43:44] emperor issued a proclamation to slay
[43:46] all the children from two years of age
[43:48] down
[43:49] begin to kill
[43:51] christ jesus
[43:53] and god pulled the world over his eyes
[43:55] and he took him down into egypt and hit
[43:57] him
[43:58] as he did moses the same way
[44:02] now
[44:04] so now we got a compound meaning of
[44:06] revelations
[44:08] 12
[44:10] coming into view that one meaning is
[44:13] after
[44:14] the rapture of the church
[44:19] israel is going to bring forth christ
[44:21] through those two witnesses
[44:22] god is
[44:26] and they're going to preach it so
[44:28] straight until
[44:29] that 144 000 will produce christ
[44:34] not just uh two witnesses not just by
[44:36] themselves
[44:38] brother brown says that brother richard
[44:40] wilson overtake the other day talking
[44:41] about it
[44:43] but it runs says that that brings forth
[44:44] a mighty 144 thousand
[44:50] i mean those two witnesses is not always
[44:52] going to be fighting over at the end of
[44:54] this time
[44:56] the two witnesses are killed
[44:58] they're raptured up 144 000 is killed
[45:02] and they got to be taken up somewhere
[45:04] because they wind up in the millennium
[45:06] all right
[45:08] what's your prophet saying so
[45:10] but you see church what we're trying to
[45:12] do is take the symbols
[45:15] look at the symbols see what the symbols
[45:17] are but placing it
[45:22] because what would you do if you just
[45:23] come over here in the end time and said
[45:25] revelation 12 is from the rapture the
[45:27] bride you know i'm going up and and then
[45:29] it's all the issue
[45:32] he you wouldn't be able to see the man
[45:34] child you wouldn't know nothing about
[45:35] revelations 12. see so revelation 12
[45:38] drops all the way back 2 000 years ago
[45:43] and you can see back there that those
[45:46] old testament saints gave birth to jesus
[45:48] christ
[45:53] and then he was taken up before they
[45:55] could kill him
[45:56] jury come back being it wasn't wrong
[45:58] that killed him
[46:01] right
[46:02] it was a jews that finally killed him
[46:05] right now we know that roman punishment
[46:07] had to happen we understand because it
[46:08] all had to be wrong that's why it has to
[46:10] come through rome run around south give
[46:12] me on the feast of the trumpets the
[46:13] other day where he said it's the same
[46:15] old spirit
[46:18] the natural rome was the same old spirit
[46:20] the natural rome tried to kill jesus
[46:22] christ when he came
[46:25] herod sent out the crime killed all the
[46:27] babies and things
[46:30] but god took that woman and
[46:33] you know joseph and mary and he went
[46:35] down to egypt
[46:37] now watch it in a minute when we get on
[46:38] down a little further you'll see that he
[46:40] provides a place
[46:44] in the end time
[46:46] for that 144 thousand to flee to for a
[46:49] while
[46:51] but then they're killed
[46:55] where are you listening now
[47:00] and there appeared another great wonder
[47:01] in heaven verse 3.
[47:04] and behold a great red dragon
[47:09] well let me let's finish number four we
[47:10] never get all of it on number four i
[47:12] don't think dude
[47:16] yeah okay remember number four
[47:19] number five
[47:21] going to number five we finished with
[47:22] four now watch
[47:25] and when jesus was born the red dragon
[47:29] in heaven
[47:31] stood at the woman to devour her child
[47:33] as soon as it was born
[47:35] the red dragon in heaven
[47:39] what are you talking about brother brown
[47:43] see we're gonna find out in a minute
[47:44] that sin started in heaven right
[47:48] then start on earth
[47:51] satan didn't become the devil on earth
[47:55] he become the devil in heaven
[47:58] rome watch what he's saying
[48:01] and when jesus was born the red dragon
[48:04] in heaven stood at the woman to devour a
[48:06] child as soon as it was born is that
[48:08] right it was it tried to devour christ
[48:10] when it was born congregation says wrong
[48:12] see there's the red dragon
[48:15] here's your prince here's your bc
[48:18] there they are every one of them just to
[48:20] sign him devour the child god called it
[48:22] up into heaven to sit on this throne
[48:24] that's where christ is now until the
[48:26] time of appointed seed
[48:28] so he took him up after he come forth
[48:30] and was crucified he went up but he
[48:32] didn't go up as a baby
[48:36] what are you listening now
[48:38] should we get it together who is that
[48:40] great red dragon verse 3 talking about
[48:43] wrong
[48:47] look hate powerful pagan rome which was
[48:50] a natural roman government
[48:53] you understand what i'm saying the
[48:55] natural roman government tried to kill
[48:58] jesus christ when he was about two years
[49:00] old
[49:03] it started towards a spiritual condition
[49:06] through the jews
[49:09] and the third part of the stars we'll
[49:11] read in a minute
[49:13] with those people that stood there and
[49:15] said let his blood be on us
[49:23] see making a compound meaning out of it
[49:26] that it can be over here but it starts
[49:28] back there
[49:30] that's what i've tried my best to get
[49:32] you to see about the seals and the
[49:33] things like that
[49:37] the seals don't break until after the
[49:39] rapture of the church in a literal
[49:41] extent
[49:42] will we see where they start
[49:45] even before the foundation of the world
[49:47] when sin started in heaven
[49:52] and we can look at it and see the day
[49:54] that we're living
[49:58] all right so what did he say in verse 3
[50:01] there appeared another wonder in heaven
[50:04] behold
[50:06] a great red dragon
[50:08] having seven heads
[50:10] and ten horns and seven crowns on his
[50:13] head
[50:15] now
[50:18] the seven horns is the city
[50:22] i don't have time to get back to that
[50:23] for seven horns is the city that sits on
[50:26] seven hills
[50:28] the ten crowns
[50:31] are ten
[50:32] kingdoms
[50:34] they don't have a king
[50:36] they have a dictator
[50:39] so look where you're at now
[50:41] when eisenhower and
[50:44] khrushchev met
[50:46] eisenhower means iron and khrushchev
[50:48] means clay that was your ten toes of
[50:50] daniel
[50:52] which is the same thing as revelations
[50:56] and brother around says they receive i
[50:57] got this wrote down to get later on they
[50:59] won't get it but he said
[51:01] see those crowns he said they are not
[51:05] kings he said they're dictators
[51:10] that receive power for a time
[51:13] and this is what he said about it you
[51:14] think
[51:15] he said look at those countries all of
[51:18] them little countries wanting to line up
[51:20] with communism
[51:25] you look at cuba and all these countries
[51:30] but just remember the ten toes of daniel
[51:32] was
[51:34] iron and clay
[51:36] and when it was when they met there
[51:38] there was five western and five eastern
[51:41] countries met the ten crowns met back
[51:43] there
[51:46] so it's already happened
[51:48] we're wondering what these crowns means
[51:51] that's what i'm dealing with
[51:53] wonder what these heads are that's what
[51:54] we're dealing with
[51:56] get you to see it's already happening
[52:00] it's not some big old monster we talk
[52:02] about the beast remember some big old
[52:04] monster walking across the earth boy
[52:06] look at that beast that's that's that
[52:08] beast in the bible
[52:10] no it's got to be something religious
[52:12] deceiving
[52:17] because look at your next verse
[52:20] verse 4 and his tale drew
[52:24] the third part
[52:27] of the stars of heaven
[52:30] and it cast them to the earth
[52:33] and the dragon
[52:35] stood before the woman which was ready
[52:38] to be delivered
[52:39] ordered the barber child as soon as it
[52:41] was born
[52:44] now listen what your prophet said
[52:46] look at number six
[52:53] you know what that was
[52:56] now his tail wasn't like a forking tail
[52:59] like you say the devil's got
[53:02] what was it
[53:04] it was that tail
[53:06] that lie
[53:08] that he told
[53:12] now once
[53:14] the very jews
[53:16] by the roman empire
[53:19] crucified the lord jesus
[53:23] and over two-thirds of the jews
[53:27] denied jesus christ
[53:31] and the stars which were in heaven and
[53:33] watch what he did
[53:34] he cast them to the earth
[53:38] so we're looking for stars angels this
[53:41] and that and whatever
[53:45] when the prophet explains
[53:48] derek calvary
[53:53] they believed that lie that tale
[53:58] that satan told
[54:01] that jesus wasn't god
[54:05] what are today well he wasn't really god
[54:08] he's just a
[54:09] demon god and he's a
[54:12] he become god and then he lost being god
[54:14] and he went back being a man finally
[54:16] died
[54:17] i disassembled the old jewish fable if i
[54:20] was gonna go that way
[54:22] but are you following me
[54:25] symbols being broken by a prophet
[54:28] to tell us what simple things they mean
[54:34] and yet we're looking for some kind of a
[54:36] do it you know what i've done years ago
[54:38] when when brother brown explains
[54:40] these things
[54:42] i hope you can see it just a little bit
[54:43] on the
[54:45] screen
[54:47] on my bible
[54:49] i wrote down what these things mean
[54:54] you know why
[54:56] because i believe
[54:59] he was a prophet
[55:02] and then did somebody come along and say
[55:03] well brother dale what is that red
[55:05] dragon see it's wrong
[55:12] they said well how do you know that well
[55:14] the prophet said it was
[55:16] see we didn't have the computer to be
[55:19] able to say okay hold on a minute
[55:22] there it is
[55:25] we had to make our own
[55:28] you ever sit for hours
[55:31] and try to copy a tape verbatim i wish
[55:34] you'd do it now
[55:37] sit down sometimes if you want to see
[55:39] what fun was in our day when we begun
[55:42] sit down with your
[55:44] tape player
[55:46] and copy what brother brown said you
[55:48] know
[55:49] hand write it as you listen to it you
[55:51] better believe you're gonna hear about
[55:53] five words and you're gonna cut it off
[55:56] all right
[55:58] no matter how good these topics are
[56:01] they're going to miss a lot of it
[56:04] the way they run around and talk try
[56:07] but you try to hand write it
[56:10] you'll see that we spent hours writing
[56:13] quotes
[56:14] off because of what people were saying
[56:17] well who knows what this means
[56:20] brother said where's that at
[56:23] you remember what i told that father one
[56:24] time i said something he said
[56:26] i don't know whether he said that or not
[56:28] i said i'll give you the place numbers
[56:30] don't go look at your book
[56:31] i said i'll make a deal with you if
[56:33] that's not what he said
[56:35] you call me back
[56:38] i'll put a sign on my back say i'm a
[56:40] false prophet lying devil
[56:43] you know what he didn't call me
[56:46] evidently he might have went and looked
[56:48] or even didn't care about looking either
[56:49] one
[56:52] i was just showing him how serious i was
[56:54] about it
[56:56] do you ask me something right around and
[56:57] said i'm going to tell you do you bet do
[56:59] the best i can to tell you what he's
[57:00] saying
[57:02] then that way it's not my opinion
[57:05] if it is i'll tell you about it
[57:08] you see when you start saying brother
[57:10] brown said this is what this means this
[57:12] is what that means this is what that
[57:13] means the only thing that i've done
[57:15] tonight is say
[57:18] by showing you revelations 12 as being
[57:21] after the rapture of the church and all
[57:26] and revelation 12 dealing with one drop
[57:28] to four
[57:30] has told you about this meaning and that
[57:32] meaning
[57:33] and both of those are same
[57:35] because you see this couldn't happen
[57:36] over here in the revelations
[57:38] if that hadn't happened back time
[57:41] you agree
[57:43] it could have took place
[57:46] so what is the lie the tale that satan
[57:48] told
[57:53] and it took two-thirds of the jews
[57:56] and made them deny jesus christ
[58:00] the stars which was in heaven
[58:09] come on
[58:12] they had a representative in heaven
[58:16] and the stars fell
[58:19] stars as
[58:20] sons
[58:22] right
[58:23] you need those
[58:26] i try to cut it down as much as i can
[58:28] but do you need me to show that the
[58:29] stars are the sons of
[58:34] god he said the sons of god can't fall
[58:41] anybody got a mirror
[58:44] would you mind taking it out and looking
[58:46] at it
[58:48] you fail
[58:52] so don't think nothing about them
[58:53] falling
[58:55] and that's what we've done we fell for
[58:56] the lie that satan is cold
[58:59] right
[59:00] and he's still in that sideline
[59:06] that he told eve in the garden
[59:09] right
[59:12] you won't die
[59:14] you'll be his gods
[59:17] he said he's still telling the same lie
[59:18] today
[59:22] well you don't need to know these things
[59:26] well what do we need to know this book
[59:28] of revelations well well
[59:30] when you said we're going to go up 4-1
[59:34] but i think we can find a lot of things
[59:36] in here that are very valuable
[59:39] at least if nothing else to find out
[59:41] what the symbols mean
[59:44] to get away from those big headed things
[59:46] we used to think they were remember the
[59:48] other day when we were talking about the
[59:50] the beast that had a hair
[59:52] long hair you know and boy this
[59:56] the brother and said
[59:58] men with long hair to torment the women
[1:00:00] because of cutting nerves off
[1:00:07] yeah we're looking for some kind of a
[1:00:08] great
[1:00:09] who understands what leaders
[1:00:12] yeah
[1:00:14] and that's his lie that he's telling you
[1:00:18] the prophet told the truth
[1:00:20] look what he says
[1:00:24] who is this when you're talking about
[1:00:25] the devil look at number seven
[1:00:31] you say the dragon had something to do
[1:00:33] with the jews
[1:00:37] now remember the dragon comes all over
[1:00:38] rome
[1:00:40] right
[1:00:41] apple rum
[1:00:44] but remember the jews were under
[1:00:45] captivity to the natural romans
[1:00:50] you said the dragon had something to do
[1:00:52] with the jews certainly
[1:00:54] they said this jesus says he's the king
[1:00:57] we have no king but caesar
[1:01:01] that's right see the devil preparing
[1:01:04] them jewish hearts
[1:01:06] back there to deny
[1:01:08] jesus christ when he come
[1:01:13] can you see the devil denying hearts
[1:01:16] today
[1:01:17] to deny the power of the holy ghost
[1:01:20] when he come just exactly the same
[1:01:22] yes honest and sincere
[1:01:27] but you're deeply and
[1:01:29] but if you're deeply and seek after god
[1:01:33] like some of them jews did they walked
[1:01:35] right out and received him anyhow
[1:01:39] that's right
[1:01:40] they didn't care what the church said
[1:01:43] but it cost two-thirds of them it cast
[1:01:45] two-thirds of them to the ground
[1:01:47] and the dragon stood before the woman to
[1:01:49] devour the child as soon as it was born
[1:01:51] now who stood be what government what
[1:01:55] power stood before the woman
[1:01:57] the jewish orthodox church
[1:02:01] now you can see he's done got rome
[1:02:03] together as a natural government
[1:02:05] and
[1:02:07] the orthodox church
[1:02:11] now let me say it this way where you
[1:02:13] won't get confused
[1:02:17] the orthodox church
[1:02:21] the jews that gave birth to jesus christ
[1:02:25] didn't reject jesus christ
[1:02:33] come on
[1:02:37] the true jew that's what your prophet
[1:02:39] just got through saying
[1:02:41] get honest and sincere but if you seek
[1:02:43] after god received that's the way they
[1:02:45] did
[1:02:46] the dragon stood all right where's that
[1:02:48] the devil denying their hearts
[1:02:51] you got in their hearts to deny jesus
[1:02:53] christ when they come
[1:02:54] yet the same yet honest and sincere if
[1:02:57] you're deeply sick after god like some
[1:02:59] of them jews did they walk right out and
[1:03:02] receive him
[1:03:07] the old orthodox church as we call it
[1:03:10] all of it didn't receive jesus christ he
[1:03:12] was trying to crucify christ
[1:03:16] but at the same time they were trying to
[1:03:18] crucify christ
[1:03:19] there was at least 12
[1:03:23] that had already accepted jesus christ
[1:03:26] not as a new birth because he had not
[1:03:28] been crucified
[1:03:31] but the twelve apostles we was reading
[1:03:33] one ago would be the crown in the
[1:03:34] woman's head
[1:03:37] see so now do you see the difference the
[1:03:39] orthodox church
[1:03:43] gave birth to jesus christ but israel as
[1:03:46] a natural people never gave birth to
[1:03:49] jesus christ do you understand
[1:03:53] i don't know why that would even have to
[1:03:55] be preached
[1:03:56] on but that's where people miss it at
[1:03:59] seemingly
[1:04:01] just because you don't explain
[1:04:02] everything to a detail and you're doing
[1:04:04] all you can to explain it for things
[1:04:05] with detail
[1:04:08] but listen church
[1:04:12] no more than the bride down to the ages
[1:04:16] was all the bride
[1:04:19] there was an elected bride
[1:04:22] the rest of them were part of the church
[1:04:25] right
[1:04:29] and turned and proved it by becoming a
[1:04:31] catholic church a baptist methodist or
[1:04:34] brahmites
[1:04:37] me
[1:04:40] are you listening
[1:04:45] some of them accepted jesus christ
[1:04:47] they never fell for satan's lie
[1:04:53] it was the two-thirds that listened to
[1:04:55] it lie
[1:04:56] they crucified jesus christ
[1:05:00] because they got power you've fallen on
[1:05:02] down the orthodox church through divine
[1:05:03] crime the orthodox church put jesus to
[1:05:06] death
[1:05:07] but the romans had to okay
[1:05:10] right
[1:05:12] you had to do it because
[1:05:14] the jews had no
[1:05:15] that you know the story of what it is
[1:05:17] they were in captivity they had rights
[1:05:20] of all of their laws except one thing
[1:05:23] they could not kill a man
[1:05:28] they just got by a lot of times by
[1:05:30] stoning people
[1:05:33] they did kill a lot of people
[1:05:35] but they just thrown them to death to
[1:05:36] take a change
[1:05:38] and the roman government says we don't
[1:05:39] want to cause no trouble so okay they
[1:05:41] got rid of one of them guys
[1:05:46] see the roman government and the jewish
[1:05:48] church was dealing hand in hand
[1:05:51] to crucify christ
[1:05:56] it was not roman soldiers that captured
[1:05:59] jesus in the garden
[1:06:01] right you know that
[1:06:03] it was the jewish guards of the temple
[1:06:09] what roman soldiers that went out there
[1:06:10] and got jesus the romans went in who
[1:06:12] would took him away from my favor hadn't
[1:06:14] been such a big mess but come on
[1:06:17] in the time we get to believing and
[1:06:20] read the book and find out the prophet
[1:06:21] said these things
[1:06:25] i don't bo it don't bother me at all to
[1:06:27] preach the people i love to preach to
[1:06:28] people that know what the prophet saying
[1:06:32] but what i hate to preach to is third
[1:06:34] grade education
[1:06:36] bunched it
[1:06:37] but he said this but he said to him
[1:06:42] making him a false prophet
[1:06:46] why did he say it this way
[1:06:49] i don't know ask him
[1:06:51] but listen
[1:06:54] do you understand what i'm trying to
[1:06:55] bring
[1:06:56] i know i'm getting lengthy on him
[1:07:01] that wrong that revelations 12
[1:07:05] will be after we get out of here
[1:07:08] because like israel
[1:07:11] of the old testament gave birth to jesus
[1:07:15] christ
[1:07:18] all right
[1:07:20] the real true jews
[1:07:24] the 12 apostles would say even just that
[1:07:26] much would be the crowning glory of the
[1:07:30] old testament
[1:07:32] because they came into the new testament
[1:07:36] and would bring the doctrine of jesus
[1:07:38] christ
[1:07:40] because they were with him all the time
[1:07:43] and that would be your old orthodox
[1:07:45] church bringing forth christ but not all
[1:07:47] israel
[1:07:52] the other part of israel tried to kill
[1:07:53] me
[1:07:55] right over here in the end time
[1:08:01] after we get out of here
[1:08:03] the old natural
[1:08:05] israeli government israel is a nation
[1:08:08] they're going to go back to making daily
[1:08:10] sacrifices
[1:08:13] but that 144 000 then two witnesses
[1:08:16] gonna try to tell them
[1:08:17] they're gonna try to tell them who jesus
[1:08:19] christ is
[1:08:21] and they're gonna kill them because of
[1:08:24] that
[1:08:27] just as they kill jesus christ the same
[1:08:29] old roman devil
[1:08:34] and over here it's going to be
[1:08:36] called catholics and protestants
[1:08:42] now well okay go back and read the
[1:08:44] fourth seal
[1:08:47] and find me one country run around named
[1:08:50] under that four seal that would be
[1:08:52] coming down to fight against
[1:08:54] israel come on i want one country one
[1:08:57] one place that he says russia
[1:09:00] or china son
[1:09:02] now when he gets over to armageddon he
[1:09:04] says catholics and protestants
[1:09:07] because that's where they are they're
[1:09:08] all over the world rome i mean the whole
[1:09:11] whole world is under that system
[1:09:14] and it'll be catholics and protestants
[1:09:18] coming to fight against israel but not
[1:09:20] against the natural nation of israel
[1:09:22] because the natural nation of israel
[1:09:24] will be in an antichrist covenant
[1:09:27] they will be fighting against 144 000
[1:09:29] and the two witnesses right they kill
[1:09:32] those two witnesses and god raises them
[1:09:34] up in a rapture they'll finally kill 144
[1:09:37] 000 according to the revelations when
[1:09:39] it's the fifth seal where it said until
[1:09:40] your brethren are killed also
[1:09:43] as you were
[1:09:45] and 144 000 are going to be killed
[1:09:51] you see
[1:09:52] today those two prophets
[1:09:55] are going to bring jesus christ so much
[1:09:58] on the scene
[1:10:00] to those forty four thousand they say
[1:10:02] where did you get the nail prints in
[1:10:04] your hand
[1:10:06] you think that ain't gonna be giving
[1:10:07] birth it won't be giving birth to a baby
[1:10:12] the israel of all gave birth to a baby
[1:10:15] this true jews
[1:10:17] are going to give birth to jesus christ
[1:10:19] a full grown man
[1:10:22] one like unto the son of man the
[1:10:23] scripture says
[1:10:25] where are you following me
[1:10:27] are we going to listen to the lie tales
[1:10:31] let's go on down go to go to verse five
[1:10:33] brother you got it on there
[1:10:36] i know we were pulling these up while
[1:10:37] ago and i didn't tell them to bring up a
[1:10:39] certain one so go to revelation 12 5
[1:10:41] let's read it
[1:10:45] let's do that before we get down to
[1:10:46] number eight
[1:10:49] okay
[1:10:55] and she brought forth a man-child
[1:10:59] see
[1:11:00] all right the dragon stood before the
[1:11:02] woman was ready to deliver the divine
[1:11:03] child as soon as he was born
[1:11:06] okay
[1:11:07] and she brought forth a man-child who
[1:11:08] was ruled the nation with a rod of iron
[1:11:10] and her child was caught up unto god
[1:11:13] and to his throne
[1:11:16] that's two thousand years between the
[1:11:17] difference in coming into his throne
[1:11:21] into being
[1:11:23] and back there work
[1:11:24] started and it's 33 years between his
[1:11:28] birth and him trying to kill him with
[1:11:29] the natural romans
[1:11:31] and being taken up to his throne
[1:11:33] once and the lord fled into the
[1:11:35] wilderness where she hath the place
[1:11:36] prepared of god that they should feed
[1:11:38] her there a thousand two hundred and
[1:11:40] three score days what is that three and
[1:11:42] a half years tribulation now you jump
[1:11:44] two thousand years
[1:11:48] just between one or two verses you've
[1:11:50] jumped three thousand two thousand years
[1:11:55] but now you know what that number is
[1:11:57] now and watch
[1:12:01] what's the compound meaning of this now
[1:12:06] verse seven and there was war in heaven
[1:12:09] michael and his angels fought against
[1:12:10] the dragon and the dragon fought in his
[1:12:12] angels
[1:12:14] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:12:15] place found any their place found any
[1:12:19] more in heaven
[1:12:24] michael and his angels thought were
[1:12:25] lucifer
[1:12:26] six thousand years ago amen
[1:12:30] right that's just time of day in the day
[1:12:35] because sin began in heaven
[1:12:39] right
[1:12:40] and dropped down to earth
[1:12:43] so what did he go up to
[1:12:48] the dragon was cast out
[1:12:52] that old serpent called the devil
[1:12:54] the satan which deceived the whole world
[1:12:56] he was cast out of the earth his angels
[1:12:58] were cast out with
[1:13:00] all
[1:13:02] right 12 10 lord lives a little where
[1:13:05] might he see
[1:13:07] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:13:09] heaven now is salvation and strength
[1:13:12] in the kingdom of our god and the power
[1:13:14] of his christ for the accuser of our
[1:13:16] brother and is cast down who excuses
[1:13:18] them before our god day and night
[1:13:21] two thousand years six thousand years
[1:13:23] between the two
[1:13:25] michael and lucifer fight
[1:13:27] in heaven
[1:13:30] satan is cast out brought around said
[1:13:32] come to earth
[1:13:34] and start it in the garden of eden
[1:13:38] right
[1:13:39] it's gonna be cast out again
[1:13:45] he's going to be cast out again let's
[1:13:46] read a couple of these and then we'll
[1:13:48] have to squeal again
[1:13:51] look at number eight
[1:13:56] and abby was playing a while ago from a
[1:13:58] little contraction come off again
[1:14:04] this is questions and answers 54
[1:14:08] 103 the morning service the 12th chapter
[1:14:13] revelation the woman standing in the sun
[1:14:15] the red dragon put his tail around
[1:14:17] two-thirds of the stars now we don't see
[1:14:19] who's that the jews it was cast down
[1:14:22] pull them down to earth we realize that
[1:14:24] satan in the beginning set up a kingdom
[1:14:26] in the north lands to be more beautiful
[1:14:29] than what the than what the michaels was
[1:14:32] and there was a day when he declared war
[1:14:33] in heaven and he pulled two thirds of
[1:14:35] the angelic beings with him is that
[1:14:37] right
[1:14:40] all right look at a day
[1:14:43] the unfailing realities of
[1:14:46] living god remember sin didn't begin on
[1:14:49] earth then began in heaven when lucifer
[1:14:51] taken and made him he said i want a
[1:14:53] denomination
[1:14:54] make a great big thing went on the north
[1:14:56] country and set up a bigger thing that
[1:14:58] michael had and he was kicked out of
[1:15:00] heaven
[1:15:03] now if that's not compound where are you
[1:15:05] going with it
[1:15:07] he was kicked out back there
[1:15:12] you see the meaning he was kicked out
[1:15:13] back there
[1:15:15] he's going to be kicked out again in the
[1:15:17] end
[1:15:20] right
[1:15:22] you're going to be kicked out here in
[1:15:23] the end time
[1:15:27] now you don't have to wait over there a
[1:15:28] long way you need to be kicked out
[1:15:32] we know michael is christ everybody
[1:15:34] understand that
[1:15:36] the beginning of the gentile
[1:15:37] dispensation number nine
[1:15:43] michael shall stand the great prince
[1:15:45] michael was christ of course who fought
[1:15:47] the angelic wars in heaven with the
[1:15:48] devil satan and michael thought to give
[1:15:51] our fought against each other rather
[1:15:52] than and at that time he said as many as
[1:15:54] were found written in the book
[1:15:56] but was delivered and those who had done
[1:15:58] righteous watch this now watch look at
[1:16:01] the next one this is one i like because
[1:16:03] see satan's going to be cast out in the
[1:16:05] end time
[1:16:08] now do you remember reading over there
[1:16:10] where he said he's the accuser of the
[1:16:11] brethren
[1:16:13] now do you need do i need to spend on
[1:16:15] out of time you realize satan right now
[1:16:18] can go up there before god and accuse
[1:16:20] you of doing wrong
[1:16:25] and god looks at him and says i don't
[1:16:27] see it
[1:16:31] right
[1:16:32] i don't see it
[1:16:35] yeah but they don't switch on he said i
[1:16:37] don't see it
[1:16:42] and like i've always said you know we
[1:16:43] cry and pray to try to get an audience
[1:16:45] from god the devil can go see him every
[1:16:47] day
[1:16:52] that's hard
[1:16:54] no more a lot to think about
[1:16:58] but you see it's the way god set it up
[1:17:02] he permits him to come in there
[1:17:07] but you know what i love the prophet to
[1:17:08] say like this
[1:17:11] he said will god listen to an angel
[1:17:15] or will he listen to a son of god
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:25] you realize we have a whole lot more
[1:17:27] power in heaven than satan ever thought
[1:17:29] about having
[1:17:33] we're going to have that on earth
[1:17:37] right
[1:17:39] but you know our problem is we don't
[1:17:41] believe it that's
[1:17:42] it we don't believe what god has made us
[1:17:49] and then we allow our everyday lives to
[1:17:52] interfere to where we can't
[1:17:55] walk where we need to walk and i said me
[1:17:57] and you all of us
[1:18:02] but you know that satan is
[1:18:05] he was cast out back here before the
[1:18:06] foundation of the world
[1:18:10] but he's going to be cast out again
[1:18:13] look at the next quote
[1:18:16] where
[1:18:18] let's see women let's go back a day
[1:18:21] i mean 9 excuse me back that one
[1:18:24] the first seal program 361. then in
[1:18:27] revelations 12 7-9
[1:18:30] when satan has cast out the accuser i
[1:18:32] want you to put that down
[1:18:34] but i want to read it you haven't got
[1:18:36] time now because
[1:18:39] but in revelations 12 9 satan the spirit
[1:18:42] the devil which is up there now accuser
[1:18:46] of our brethren
[1:18:48] all right the church is taken up and
[1:18:51] satan is cast out
[1:18:55] now we're finding some great things to
[1:18:57] be placed in among these things
[1:19:00] about you and i when the church goes up
[1:19:02] satan comes down then satan incarnates
[1:19:05] himself in the antichrist and is called
[1:19:07] the beast
[1:19:09] what about that
[1:19:11] but do we need to know about these
[1:19:12] things well that right there just put
[1:19:14] that little point right in the middle
[1:19:16] i think would be worth three or four
[1:19:17] sermons of dullness
[1:19:22] of understanding the symbols and the
[1:19:24] quotes and the thoughts
[1:19:27] i call it bonus on your part not mine
[1:19:31] but you understand
[1:19:39] when we go up satan's coming out
[1:19:45] see god thanks so much of
[1:19:48] you satan can go up there now and accuse
[1:19:52] you
[1:19:53] but one day
[1:19:55] he will not be able to go to heaven
[1:20:00] and talk to god
[1:20:02] it's because you were there
[1:20:06] when that wife walked into that palace
[1:20:08] or walked into a rapture and what do you
[1:20:10] want to say
[1:20:13] satan is already cast out
[1:20:16] that's why the scripture said he had
[1:20:17] just a little season
[1:20:20] see he knows when he's cast out that
[1:20:22] ain't gonna be long he's gonna be
[1:20:23] destroyed
[1:20:26] that's why i always try to tell you
[1:20:28] the devil tells you that you're not this
[1:20:30] and you're not there tell him say well
[1:20:32] one of these days i'll be in eternity
[1:20:34] and you'll be destroyed
[1:20:40] then you don't have no hope
[1:20:43] you don't have to talk to
[1:20:44] it well these days you get honest enough
[1:20:47] you'll find out
[1:20:49] you talk to the devil a whole lot more
[1:20:51] you talk to god
[1:20:53] no no now bless god well why'd you stir
[1:20:55] it up that way
[1:20:58] you know it's true
[1:21:03] i don't talk to that devil
[1:21:10] well it may be true maybe he's already
[1:21:12] got you oh
[1:21:15] okay
[1:21:18] what do you understand
[1:21:23] when we go up he comes down
[1:21:25] right
[1:21:29] see according to the book of daniel
[1:21:32] the natural jew that michael will stand
[1:21:35] on his side and fight for him
[1:21:38] but you know what
[1:21:40] we are spiritual jews
[1:21:43] who do you think it is happening now
[1:21:51] i thought it was christ's name for glory
[1:21:55] i thought he was the one that was
[1:21:56] battling satan
[1:21:59] i thought he was the only one that knew
[1:22:00] how to handle satan and was michael that
[1:22:02] even the great gabriel
[1:22:04] that would be standing beside the lord
[1:22:06] and could deliver messages even to
[1:22:10] the birth of jesus christ but yet he
[1:22:12] wasn't able to handle
[1:22:15] satan
[1:22:16] in the book of daniel
[1:22:19] but christ kept on the scene
[1:22:23] and the battle was over
[1:22:27] christ is the one that's in your heart
[1:22:29] right now
[1:22:30] michael
[1:22:31] christ fighting the battle
[1:22:36] you're a couple of ones that's been in
[1:22:37] these car wrecks who do you think was in
[1:22:39] that car
[1:22:42] anna years ago had a wreck
[1:22:46] and tore a car up and she said it felt
[1:22:48] like she was floating on our
[1:22:51] in the car just like
[1:22:53] when she anything to touch it was just
[1:22:55] soft
[1:22:57] who do you think's on your side
[1:23:02] but you ever think about
[1:23:04] it you've talked to him
[1:23:08] see he's the one that can take care of
[1:23:10] satan that's right
[1:23:13] but he's not going to be cast out of
[1:23:15] heaven till we get there
[1:23:17] all right i don't have time to preach
[1:23:18] this point
[1:23:20] but if he's not cast out of this bride
[1:23:22] in the end time
[1:23:26] don't even worry about israel and all
[1:23:28] the symbols and the thoughts and ideas
[1:23:30] and what will be
[1:23:33] if he can't be if if christ can't cast
[1:23:36] satan out now
[1:23:38] out of your hearts and lies and minds
[1:23:40] and thoughts and things
[1:23:48] ain't going to be no in the bible
[1:23:51] this is the decisive battle
[1:23:53] that's right
[1:23:55] no it was fought out at calvary amen
[1:24:00] but we're still in these old bodies
[1:24:05] we're still under the curse in the body
[1:24:08] spirit part of man
[1:24:12] and there's a battle going on the
[1:24:13] greatest battle ever fought in the human
[1:24:15] mind
[1:24:21] when we go up satan's cast out because
[1:24:24] he can't be there where we're at
[1:24:26] that's how much god thinks of you
[1:24:30] well why can't we bring that battle down
[1:24:32] on earth
[1:24:34] and get on with it
[1:24:41] and just challenge the devil
[1:24:46] man set my home one time because i was
[1:24:47] telling him his brother was wrong and he
[1:24:49] said brother tell you
[1:24:52] why
[1:24:53] he said you correct that brother brother
[1:24:55] he said you'll become exalted
[1:24:59] don't you worry brother
[1:25:02] there's too many devils around and let
[1:25:04] me get exhausted
[1:25:06] as long as i don't join up with them
[1:25:10] i'm not gonna have any trouble
[1:25:13] i'm gonna have a battle
[1:25:19] but to find out who it was
[1:25:22] you know the devil used to be god's
[1:25:24] right hand man right
[1:25:27] he was the anointed cherub that stood
[1:25:29] beside the lord
[1:25:32] it was his right-hand man
[1:25:37] that's what i've always said about him
[1:25:39] he never could understand it
[1:25:42] he knew all of my angels he could call
[1:25:44] every name of those angels wormwood
[1:25:46] gabriel you could bring them all down
[1:25:48] satan could
[1:25:51] but one day there was one step out there
[1:25:53] that he didn't understand
[1:25:56] he knew he could handle gabriel which
[1:25:58] would be the top
[1:26:01] but one day somebody stepped out there
[1:26:03] and
[1:26:06] it was a battle
[1:26:08] not this kind you know boy
[1:26:11] just fighting no no
[1:26:16] i never have believed that i wonder what
[1:26:18] would be the matter with people's mind
[1:26:19] to make them think you mean supernatural
[1:26:21] beings fight battles
[1:26:23] you know touching each other
[1:26:26] silly
[1:26:28] demons
[1:26:33] but you see
[1:26:34] satan right now is attacking your mind
[1:26:42] it'll be according to what we do with it
[1:26:45] we decide to battle
[1:26:47] right
[1:26:49] whether we believe him or not
[1:26:50] that's right
[1:26:52] he was god's right-hand man but you just
[1:26:54] think about it him standing there and
[1:26:56] all at once one just steps out from god
[1:26:59] how else would you express it
[1:27:01] just steps out and he says
[1:27:04] let there be
[1:27:08] and the world comes into existence
[1:27:11] he just creates and he begins doing all
[1:27:13] the creating
[1:27:14] because according to my bible it says
[1:27:16] that jesus christ not
[1:27:18] jesus the flesh man jesus christ
[1:27:22] created all things according to my bible
[1:27:28] satan stood there and watched him doing
[1:27:29] all that creating and he said i can't do
[1:27:32] that
[1:27:36] i might be able to have these angels but
[1:27:37] i can't do that who is that
[1:27:42] and the bible calls him michael
[1:27:46] the prophet called in christ
[1:27:52] christ can battle i went to jamaica that
[1:27:54] time and i didn't know he had a song of
[1:27:56] it i preached on michael and christ and
[1:27:58] the things and they got up so
[1:28:01] i was ready to rejoice you know all over
[1:28:03] the place because they were singing the
[1:28:04] song you've heard it you know michael on
[1:28:06] your side
[1:28:12] listen church
[1:28:18] satan can't win we'll just stop on that
[1:28:20] cut up i got some more downs below but i
[1:28:22] want to bring i want to wait on it
[1:28:25] of revelations 12. but let me just
[1:28:29] talk about it a minute
[1:28:32] because every battle that's ever been
[1:28:33] fought
[1:28:35] has been between god and the devil
[1:28:38] that's right
[1:28:40] that's the bible
[1:28:44] it looks like after a while that the
[1:28:46] devil would realize he can't win
[1:28:48] but you see he keeps trying all again
[1:28:53] he's going to get everything he can he's
[1:28:55] going to be loose one of these days
[1:28:56] after the millennium and he's going to
[1:28:59] gather a great multitude
[1:29:02] and coming right back up to jerusalem
[1:29:04] again
[1:29:05] because he thinks he can whip god
[1:29:11] but what about the devil and all of his
[1:29:12] angels couldn't handle one man
[1:29:16] that was the man of christ jesus
[1:29:22] would never devil and hell loosed on
[1:29:23] jesus christ
[1:29:27] come on is it right
[1:29:29] well you know i thought maybe under that
[1:29:32] little bit of the feast of the trumpets
[1:29:33] i was trying to bring out that you'd
[1:29:35] remember that
[1:29:37] those demons it was loose to drive the
[1:29:39] jews to the homeland under hitler and
[1:29:41] eichmann and him 20 years later was
[1:29:44] released on the bride
[1:29:45] to drive her to the message of the hour
[1:29:52] you know what i do when i begin to feel
[1:29:54] down and out
[1:29:59] i start reading
[1:30:02] or listening to things
[1:30:03] what do you
[1:30:04] do let's go out with a pity party
[1:30:07] nobody don't love me
[1:30:10] well
[1:30:13] i just start reading
[1:30:15] because i know
[1:30:18] i've learned one thing about fighting
[1:30:19] satan
[1:30:23] when he's leaving me alone i got a
[1:30:25] problem
[1:30:27] because i can't figure out what he's
[1:30:28] doing
[1:30:30] but when i'm fighting
[1:30:32] i know where it's at
[1:30:35] sure it's in me
[1:30:38] but i know what he's doing
[1:30:42] but you see if he can be cast out of
[1:30:44] menu on this earth through justification
[1:30:46] sanctification the baptism when the holy
[1:30:48] ghost and a restored word of god
[1:30:53] then he'll be cast out of heaven
[1:30:58] because he ain't going to be there where
[1:31:00] you at
[1:31:01] what about a god that loves you so much
[1:31:04] he won't let satan be in your presence
[1:31:12] okay
[1:31:14] we want to defeat satan just get in the
[1:31:16] word
[1:31:20] you didn't start reading
[1:31:22] you're listening to tapes and things
[1:31:26] i mean what else is more important
[1:31:33] because we get to feel we get the word
[1:31:35] in the field don't worry about god
[1:31:36] quickening come on brother
[1:31:38] we'll continue to chapter 12 on the next
[1:31:40] message
[1:31:47] but the bride of jesus christ is so
[1:31:53] much god
[1:31:55] until satan can't handle her
[1:31:58] when he brought around say they said
[1:32:00] brother brown said you said
[1:32:03] that we could live so close to god until
[1:32:05] satan didn't know what to do with us
[1:32:11] now what's living close to god
[1:32:14] the prophet said pray
[1:32:17] and read your bible
[1:32:24] he said there's one thing about it we
[1:32:26] can do too much of this and we can do
[1:32:27] too much of that but he said we can't
[1:32:29] pray too much
[1:32:38] because he can't stand you
[1:32:41] now if you don't believe it if you can't
[1:32:43] understand what i'm driving at one of
[1:32:45] these days when we go up he's got to
[1:32:46] come down
[1:32:49] because he can't be there
[1:32:52] well if you don't understand there's
[1:32:53] sometimes when you're down and out and
[1:32:55] satan is beating you to death just start
[1:32:57] praying and calling jesus and thanking
[1:33:00] him and worship him
[1:33:02] and watch him leave
[1:33:07] right
[1:33:09] watch him leave you and all he wants
[1:33:11] everything just so happy
[1:33:12] you know you just
[1:33:15] well you know what you just done
[1:33:17] you just cast out satan
[1:33:21] come on how much do we need to get into
[1:33:23] it the prophet said what
[1:33:26] to cast out satan is to cast out
[1:33:28] unbelief
[1:33:34] well
[1:33:36] until truth is revealed
[1:33:39] there was no way no one could handle
[1:33:42] satan
[1:33:43] but i said we are as an individual not a
[1:33:46] match for the devil
[1:33:48] all right hey amen
[1:33:53] now let's get two meanings out of this
[1:33:55] compound
[1:33:58] i'm not no match for the devil and i
[1:34:00] realize that
[1:34:03] but i thought
[1:34:06] that i could find a quote that would say
[1:34:10] that you can live so close to god until
[1:34:12] the devil don't know what to do he
[1:34:20] okay which one we want to be you know we
[1:34:22] want to be the down and out and the bad
[1:34:24] at the mouth you know
[1:34:28] you know i found out a long time ago
[1:34:32] that the most down and out of the mouth
[1:34:33] you can get
[1:34:35] you know
[1:34:36] so bad
[1:34:37] you just start looking around and you'll
[1:34:39] find something a whole lot worse
[1:34:43] another day in the paper there you've
[1:34:44] had a couple of days you may have seen
[1:34:46] it
[1:34:47] about that boy that was in iraq i think
[1:34:49] it was a
[1:34:50] roadside bomb blowed up both legs off
[1:34:52] both arms
[1:34:55] how did you like life like that
[1:35:01] you know what they've done now they put
[1:35:03] two arms on
[1:35:05] and he said begin able to move
[1:35:09] he said i don't care about the legs
[1:35:12] he said because you just don't
[1:35:14] understand he's in today's fight so you
[1:35:16] don't understand sid
[1:35:19] if you got arms you can love and hug and
[1:35:22] feel
[1:35:24] you could just see the man's
[1:35:26] thoughts in his mind
[1:35:28] not lustful
[1:35:30] but to think about he could hug his mom
[1:35:40] you see church
[1:35:41] we get down and out start looking at
[1:35:43] something like that and start saying
[1:35:44] well lord i ain't that far down
[1:35:47] help me let's stand
[1:35:49] we'll take the rest of it and go on
[1:35:51] dealing with the remnant of the woman's
[1:35:52] seed
[1:35:54] and
[1:35:55] see everything has to have many meanings
[1:35:57] to it but not now listen please on the
[1:36:00] air
[1:36:00] listen
[1:36:02] not many meanings that are different
[1:36:06] i'm not talking about a junk
[1:36:09] many meanings but they all tied together
[1:36:12] into one beautiful picture
[1:36:14] you followed that through revelations
[1:36:16] five of revelation 12 and i
[1:36:19] you see the black yonder thing was
[1:36:21] happening you see satan was cast out
[1:36:23] before the world but you see he'll be
[1:36:25] kept out of the end time
[1:36:28] you see that
[1:36:30] that christ child was born back there in
[1:36:32] rome with third and desire
[1:36:36] you know this little ride you've got to
[1:36:38] give birth to jesus christ
[1:36:42] and it'll be this man child
[1:36:44] not a baby that goes to israel
[1:36:49] not a baby's going to israel is going to
[1:36:51] be a man child that comes from you and i
[1:36:57] your words
[1:37:00] not different meanings
[1:37:07] there's many ways of looking until it
[1:37:09] all comes together
[1:37:12] and you'll see brother around his
[1:37:13] message that he'll say one time this
[1:37:15] means this and he'll say another time
[1:37:16] this means
[1:37:18] this don't try to throw them away
[1:37:23] just leave it alone
[1:37:25] one day it'll come together
[1:37:29] looking like a beautiful pitch
[1:37:33] then you take the bible and read it and
[1:37:35] it looks just like over here that says
[1:37:37] this and over here and it says this
[1:37:44] that's what's going to cast satan out of
[1:37:45] heaven because it's casting them out of
[1:37:47] your mind now
[1:37:50] it's the revealed word of god
[1:37:57] anybody have a name
[1:38:04] me
[1:38:23] amen
[1:38:30] is
[1:38:56] and
[1:39:08] oh
[1:39:20] hey
[1:39:28] please
[1:40:20] often one to another
[1:40:22] and a book of remembrance is written
[1:40:25] what about what she's talking about
[1:40:29] talking about him
[1:40:33] talking about our savior
[1:41:02] just be careful on the way home the
[1:41:04] weather's still bad
[1:41:05] and let the lord take care of your
[1:41:07] father we ask you to just be with
