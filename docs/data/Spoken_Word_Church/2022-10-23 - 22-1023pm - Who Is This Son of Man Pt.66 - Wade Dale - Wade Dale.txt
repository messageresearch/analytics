I was going to have more scans done but I never really give a report on it but I just didn't ruin the same thing negative after the great news but then it dawned on me that this wasn't such bad news but when I went and and they called me in immediately back to from my house back up to the doctor's office said you got to Commitment you got blood clot in your lung so I went turns out I had little teeny tiny bits of blood clots in both lungs and that scared me but then um I thought you know that's that's just like God I mean that could be God breaking that cancer up what was left in in all they know it is that it's little blood clots you know and then and and it's just like God to have me come in so they could give me a blood thinner so those little blood clots wouldn't shoot through my heart and kill me you know so anyway I'm taking it as a positive that's what it is so I'm taking blood clot I mean I'm taking blood thinner in this song I'd like to dedicate to popping nanny being

we appreciate you brother Dale I know we haven't heard you speak in a year over a year but we we missed that we miss but I'm so glad I was so glad that that you the word that you preached was recorded

Emptiness I tried so hard to hide though I laughed inside my life was fine without you I was covering up the secret tears I cried then one day someone told me of your mercy foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] she loved me I'm a man through your presence and my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away yes it's true there've been days where I have failed you Lord you know the many times I've gone astray but I've learned your love is stronger than my weakness and your ears are open every time I pray no one else has ever cared for me like you Lord other friends could never be so close to me I'm not not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow knowing you are everything I'll ever need I'm a man amazed that you love me [Music] that's how you care that your precious

amazed how you love me he loved you before you became became even human he had you in his mind before the foundation of the world he actually had you in his mind while he was making all this amen and he made it by your desire because we're going to a future home that was made because of what our desire this is a a journey that we're taking in between uh we're getting some life lessons and uh like brother Ernie Villanueva always said I can't believe he's gone brother Ernie always said we're not humans having a spiritual uh experience where spiritual people having a human experience and man because we were in this we were in the spirit Mind Of God before the foundation of the world Amen good to be in the house with the Lord good to be back good to see every one of you and I got some papers we're going to pass out here but let's uh let me get all this booted up and I'll start with getting these out of the way I forgot my pen no I didn't it's 19 16. no you didn't hear all of it zero thank you and well guess what if you want to uh duplicate it go ahead there's nothing wrong with it you can have you have all my sermons every one of them they can get them all right so take them all off but uh remember brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday Bethel Camp's coming up we've kind of got everything figured out um how we're getting everybody there so um um we will uh be getting the ones from Ohio and also Mercy and then the rest of y'all I'd ask and everybody's kind of pretty pretty well uh I don't know how they're going to get everybody in Esther's car but maybe you could put the put Michael on top put him in a luggage rack huh he going in the trunk you better put somebody small in that drunk you see those things now you know for about for Halloween they got the hands hanging out the trunk like somebody's in the back of it well his hands would literally be hanging out the trunk but uh we want to pray for that camp pray for the for the uh young brothers and sisters to get something from the Lord and we appreciate them uh brother uh Matthew and and his dad for putting it on brother Jason Watkins just pray for the different ones brother Aaron's going brother boys going and brother Louise is going they're going to be counselors and help out with the security so just pray for them as they go that will be next week all right after the second service we got Pastor appreciation month this month and we've got cake and ice cream for everybody and again less as brother Louise said we sure appreciate this there's no way until we get to the to the streets of Glory how much an impact that this church has had through brotherdale through the in in the world in the world so you know sometimes we think you're you might be asleep and you're going to the land or not but somebody's in the promised land listening it may be that they're listening later on or uh or you know listening to different series but uh we appreciate that we appreciate the the brothers that did all the work for putting this thing together because at first if you'll know my pot was not for this internet business but I thank God God changed his mind amen and we did were able to put it out over the airwaves and and y'all just don't know how much it costs to do that it cost a lot and it cost a lot of the brothers um time to uh to put this together and to keep it going and to keep brother Joe you got you know you it's like working on cars just you there's always something tearing up and you gotta fix it I know all you that are in and computers know that it just don't when you mash the button it just don't always come on man so they have to fix and I don't know one thing's for sure if there's something happening and it's not going from here out somewhere else that phone starts ringing in the back immediately we can't get the unlined we can't hear a thing we can't see nothing so and then they have to go and scramble and try to get everything back together so we sure appreciate them but let's give them a big hand too all right November the 5th uh also no November the 5th there'll be no Bible study because we're going to have to come here and we're going to do excuse me we're going to get ready for the uh wedding we're doing a rehearsal here uh and so there won't be any Bible study also November the 6th will be the wedding for Lily and Zach and uh yes well anyway um yes but we're sure looking forward to it but now let me ask you a question that will mean we won't be able to take communion and foot washing that Sunday because we'll have one service and some of them won't be here they'll be over there getting everything ready which is fine and we won't be able to have communion and foot washing that Sunday we won't be able to have it that next Sunday because that's the Thanksgiving dinner we'll only have one service the next weekend Orlando Glover will be here and we won't be able to have it then we might we could be able to have the last of November but why don't we have it and then in December we got the church thing on the fourth so that's gonna We're not gonna be able to take communion for a couple of months so why don't we yeah I said the same thing and brother Bob came up with a good idea we're just going to take it next Sunday end of the month which would be the 29th that'll be for November so we're going to take communion foot washing next Sunday I know some of you won't be here but that's okay but next Sunday we'll do communion and foot washing and that will be for November and then we'll try to figure out December if we can but a lot of times we don't in December because of all the things that goes on so is that okay with everybody we'll have it next Sunday okay I don't want to do it without it two months in a row y'all be all kind of backslid when I say y'all I mean me too okay it's it's y'all and all all y'all amen I told Brother um I told Sister Janet yesterday we were talking about brother Mike I said look he's getting the best prayer and the best care so he can't lose like I said before he's people praying around the world Chris long I called to tell him about it and somebody already called him from the Ukraine right in the middle of a battle over there they're fighting Russians and somebody had enough to to hear what was going on and call brother Chris because they had just went over there to Norway and they knew who brother Chris was and they called him and told him about it so you just never know this this thing that we call a world wide web I like the one we have I don't care about that one but you got to use the devil's equipment every once in a while to get the uh to get the message out and to get messages out for people to start praying amen so we'll have communion foot washing next Sunday Lord willing after second service as usual and then we will then we'll continue and try to figure out what to do in December remember the wedding if you have not rsvp'd it shut off when today yesterday last Monday sorry if you didn't if you RSVP you ain't coming sorry she said that what yes if you if you would like to come and you were let's say I said one two about seven times that y'all need to do that before if you've hadn't listened then go see Lily and just beg and plead okay bring cookies yeah bring money back your way in yeah it's a 30 late fee sorry 50 late fee I get 20 you get 30. so anyway all right we got the wedding coming up and we sure appreciate sister Lillian brother Zach the man we appreciate their stand for the word we appreciate them um making a commitment to each other and we've got some others around here that's making commitments to each other so we just need to pray for everybody and especially for the parents pray for the parents so now all right November 13th one service we're going to have food we'll we'll deal with that we'll start next Sunday on that uh what to bring and all that stuff if you have if you find a turkey bite y'all don't like turkeys did you find a turkey you better buy it it's not your neighbor either November the 20th Andrew Glover will be here I will be in Ohio in Illinois hunting so he'll be here that weekend also November the 22nd church will be on Tuesday that week that will be the week of Thanksgiving it will be on Tuesday not on Wednesday give you time to get out if you need to get out and go visit and be with people your loved ones or whatever travel on Wednesday it's worked out the last couple of years very well so we'll just keep it at that and uh and pray that the Lord will bless us so let's buy our heads I know we all have a special requests in our heart today let's just take them before the Lord as we pray Lord thank you for this Gathering Lord of Bride a special group of people it took a prophet to come down and separate us and tell us that we're a separate group of people that were special that were anointed that we are absolutely the cream of the crop we're at the top we're at the end time we're to finish this up we're the Omega bride and Lord you told us that you would equip us for this battle you told us that you would give us everything we need so you sent the best for last and Lord I pray that you'd just teach us something today Lord open our hearts that we'll hear from you Lord may we have truly a renewing of our mind that if we think something contrary Lord that you'll come on the scene Lord and change our mind father we ask just bless the ones that are sick be with brother Mike again Lord as he's resting there in the hospital that you'd be with the hands of the Physicians tomorrow and Lord may they put that thing back together Lord and then you do the healing father we pray that you'll just be with the ones Lord of me traveling be with the ones who go into the camp Lord be with the ones that are at the camp that are going to be counselors and and security and taking care of the safety of the of the kids Lord I pray this should be with them be with the ministers Lord the ministers in the service may you touch every heart that's in that room Lord father just bless us now and take care of us in the furtherness of this service we love you and we thank you for all things thank you for our pastor Lord they will give him a little bit time today but as he's always said the greatest gift we could give him is to live what he preaches and Lord I pray that we do that father that we live up to that expectation Lord and that you will be the one that gets to praise and honor and glory in Jesus name we pray amen part 66 in the beginning was the word the words with God and the Word was God and look the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory we're beholding now his glory you and I are as victory you and I are his glory because we are now the word made Flesh on the earth amen and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and Truth first Thessalonians says that every one of you should know how to possess that's our whole thing we're trying to get where we're listen where are you possessed at where do you where does it begin where did Eve get possessed first in her mind right Satan took over her psyche her memories and conscious effects imagine that he took that over first and then the act happened and that's the way me and you everything's got to be run through our brain first then we react according to that all right if you've got something down in here to control you you know what it's going to do it's going to try to turn you I said try to turn you to God but if you have nothing down here you're going to the world every time all right that's why the world is insane you may be saying the Lord has blessing to the word that's why the world is insane it doesn't think the way we think it doesn't act the way we act and Bella since you've come up here I'm going to let you give these out in case that she didn't want to do it anymore she said don't call me today okay what's your face red for hmm yeah I know it's okay there's 50 of those so maybe it's some and we'll look at them a little bit later but give one to everybody that wants one if we have to have any more we'll get them but I want us to realize you say well why are you I told Bob I said I can't get off the foundation because something something's got to change us even us that's been in the message for 50 years something's got to change us a little bit closer to gun now where does it start you've already had the change in your soul if you're born again if you're not you're going to do the world the things of the world I'm sorry that's just the way it is amen but those of us that are born again those of us that have the seed of God or the word of God planted in our heart and it is quickened then we should be able to what conform or transform be transformed by the renewing of our mind now what is the renewing of your mind you thought this way right here and now you got to think this way over here and I was thinking yesterday or coming back home I was thinking about you know people people are uh we everybody wants a soft nest every don't don't tell me no I want it rough I want it just rough I don't want no electricity I don't want I gotta eat eat rats and sticks and you know put sticks on a fire that's what I want no you don't you want doordash bring it to me right that's what we want because we want we're lay out of sins we want the easy way out but listen there God stood himself in a body of Flesh no different than me and you except not by carnal sex by sex you know he comes he comes spoken word but he had a body just like me and you had to wash it you had to feed it and you know who gave him the worst problem the religious people gave him the worst problems and you know what he didn't mind he didn't mind getting in their pulpit come on somebody and call him snakes called them vipers and said your daddy is not my daddy so he separated them now the Sinners and the ones and the lady that washed his feet and all these different ones they loved him why because he was bringing something new something that was renewing the way they had thought before and now they're thinking a different way the Pharisees didn't want to think a different way we've got Moses we can quote him from cover to cover we got 1100 sermons we can quote it from cover to cover listen most of the time you only quote what you like if it bothers you you kind of do like um brother Tatum said Acts 2 38 it kind of bothered him so he got to flip through it real quick you know he'd read the Bible and he'd read Matthew 28 19 baptized follow us on Holy Ghost and when he gets when he get to Acts 2 38 he said I'd read it read it and he said I'd flip over that one because it condemned him he didn't know how to handle it but you and I now we know how to handle it the world don't know how to handle these things psychology whatever you want to call it the world is tuned totally different than what the son of man was when he was on the earth there was nobody agreed with him in the Christian World nobody if you might want to call them Christians then I guess you you probably couldn't but they were they were Orthodox Jews they were somebody that knew the Torah lived the Torah hey Rich Young Ruler couldn't find one mark not one mark well Jesus found the one sell everything in other words my mind and somebody was reading it the other day well you know what he did when he left there he built more barns he got more wealth and then all of a sudden he died and his soul was required of him that day didn't matter that he had a brand new barn that might have had a brand new Cadillac didn't matter if he had a brand new house hello somebody didn't matter about that but the requirement was when he met the word he couldn't go now he could do 99 of it right man amen amen Jesus kept going through and he kept saying done all that for my youth I know every quote in this in the sailboat the church book I go to so-and-so's church hello Church can you do one more thing for me can you sell everything you got and follow me he couldn't pick that cross up he could he could look at that man and say I know you're this and I know you're that I you know like the we're reading a little while the Centurion he knew this he was a man of power but he didn't want to connect himself to that now I'm going to go build some more barns I'm just gonna go get some more wealth well then his soul was required of him because he didn't have a renewing of his mind continual to make what to make his path Jesus said sell everything you got in what follow me come with me take up your cross as we've been reading take up your cross and follow me is that what we're doing or are we sitting in a message Church saying I've got tenure I've been here longer than you so you ain't got to tell me what to do I've been here longer than you no is how much you got packed in not how much you can quote but what renews our mind is is totally different from the world and listen 50 of the people in the message nah seventy percent of the people in the message nah ninety percent of the people in the message listen if you're not born again the best you can do is be foolish virgin the best you can do then you got to die you got to go through the tribulation you got to come up and on judgment and be given account of what you do I don't want to do that I want to pass Jesus said I want you to pass from Death unto life I want you to get past all that yeah you do get a free pass everybody like playing Monopoly and remember the Monopoly you like to you love that you hated getting on go to jail right right then you get that little card says pass go collect 200 everybody wanted that one well if you'll get born again today you can pass all that junk you're not gonna get 200 but you're gonna be what Priceless yeah 10 000 worlds with one Soul saved so we've got to see that our mind we've got to ratchet it up just a little bit more you should not have to wonder you should not be double-minded we're going to read it here in a few minutes where you're wavering or uncertain or doubting or divided in interest you should say this is true this truth has been preached to me this is the way it is this is the way I believe it I may not understand it right now come on but I know where the fountain is I can get it from the fountain renew our mind that you may what prove you're going to prove to the devil that you can do it you are it's true you but you're going that's why if he rose from the grave and just said hey this I'm it this is all I got no he was just the beginning of it we're the continuation of that creation we're a continuation to go ahead to the body change can your mind handle that your heart can listen if you're born again today you're already changed you already started your change but that's going to carry you even if you have to go by the grave it's going to carry you to a body change but if you're not born again it's not right but we which are alive and remain has to come to a place to where we have to look at death and not just fool it but destroy it [Applause] you know you know people trying to fool death I'm gonna get in trouble here hair color go to the plastic surgeon take a pill somebody find that pill for me please [Laughter] I'll be 63 in a couple of months I know some of y'all are older but a lot of y'all are younger and I'm telling you these bodies I I don't think I'd want to live to be 900 years old even 200. ah not in not in the condition but listen we're heading toward eternal life that body change is not going to be listen um sorry elazarus got a temporary body change Abraham got a temporary body change but when our body has changed that's an eternal body change we're heading towards something Eternal not something temporary this is all temporary everything you see is temporary yeah Luke 8 verse 45 Jesus said who touched me when they all denied Peter said they were to him Master the multitude strongly impress thee and say and you said who touched me Jesus said somebody have touched me for I perceive that what virtue is gone out from me Matthew 8 verse 5 when Jesus was entered in Capernaum that came unto him a centurion beseeching him saying Lord my servant lies at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented him Jesus said unto him I'll come and heal him in other words he said I I I'm gonna go Centurion said no uh Lord I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only speak the word only look and he said maybe my servant shall be healed what'd he say and my servant shall be healed there was the faith that touched Jesus because Jesus said after that we'll read it maybe later on where Jesus said I have found no greater faith in Israel because all Israel wanted him to touch him Darius said come and touch my daughter then when he went in there they laughed him to score and you know remember he had to put them people out of the room before he could raise her from the dead first thing we got to do is be born again we got to leave the principal of the doctor listen our mind is not just got to be I got I'm going to come to church and I'm going to hear a a live good sermon you can get that and on the internet outside somewhere Joel Osteen go listen to him he don't preach on sin he preached on Happy stuff just be happy everything happy you get you know you get rich make sure you send it part of it to me but you get rich and you know I got to get a bigger airplane to get to my people faster you know and foreign and what are they looking for I'm telling you people as we come closer to this end time they're going to fill the pool just like we feel the pull because it's a spiritual pull now they're not going to be inside the part that you and I are because we have the word unadulterated word but they filled the pull of that anointing of the end time I know anyone's attend time that's the real pull of God or the real anointing of God on a group of false people wow so this is why we need Apostles prophets not not false ones not false prophets not false evangelists or false pastors or teachers we need the truth so if there's a false brother Michael there's got to be a true got to be you need to find it if you don't know where it's at for the perfecting of what you yes for the Perfection of you make it are you an auto saint you're either saying or hate and my brother random said he says do you know like a saint to me so like I ain't brother Brown didn't mind cutting you through the core did he he said he told that guy that what his wife looked like he said I don't think she's a saint brother I think she's a hank had all that pain on her face and stuff look we all come to the unity of the faith so don't worry we'll go get Unity of faith is to bring that five-fold Ministry in and let him help us up the statue of perfect man amen we're not going to get it any other way all right and you listen you've got to have confidence all right we gotta have confidence in brother Bob brother Aaron bro Louise myself brother Dale you gotta have confidence if you don't have confidence you need to go find somebody else to have confidence in it all right it's not listen it's not that we're it's not priest that does everything for you no we're not that way you've got a part to do yourself I'm gonna read it to you here in just a few minutes so you've got it in your hand we're going to read it it's got that little star but well you don't have a star beside yours but it does besides mine how brother round tells you how to get something I'm gonna tell you exactly how Prophet gets something here in just a few minutes look that we henceforth be no more children you look at kids and you watch them as they grow up and you think man that kid's going to be a and you know put in whatever scientists likes cars um likes to hunt likes to do this likes to do that right so why don't we come as babies in Christ we all will come as babies in Christ and then we've got to fill in the blank I'm a baby Lord but I want to be a anybody with me you fill it out whatever you know I want to be a what I want to be somebody that that this church can depend on I want to be somebody that that when somebody needs a scripture I've got it for them somebody's got a quote I've got it for them every time y'all come to me I try to find that quote as fast as I could or the scripture as fast as I could right Kathy I try to find the scriptures what you're looking for you've got a question you'll try to find a scripture and that's what you need you don't now Kathy had a question about um man writing the Bible and the Bible does say about men of old in other words were moved by the Holy Spirit In other words to write the Bible she was wanting to know where that's at well now she didn't go down here to Dollar General and asked the manager over there he probably said or she would have probably said what are you talking about I can sell you groceries and and air suppressioners and toilet paper but I don't know what you're talking about she went to the source that she knew she could draw something from that's what we're going to get to when we get to Virtue when we ever get there let's just continue and get a strong Foundation First if we got a strong Foundation that we can what we can what live that Son of God Revelation or what being come to a higher level of sanctification because what happens is we're looking at virtue that the world sees and virtue that that we see then you're looking at knowledge which is worldly knowledge over here we don't want any of that worldly knowledge we got to have an education don't you ever forget that you need an education you need to go to school you need to learn get a diploma because in this world you got to have one to succeed all right but let's don't lay it over here and say well I've got two degrees and so and so so I don't have to go to church no more okay that's it then let's go over here I'm gaining Heavenly knowledge when I go to church and I listen to the word of God I'm gaining heavily knowledge which is what Eternal this is temporary this is eternal have you ever thought about this you know the things that bothers you so much the trials and tribulations as I've talked about a little bit this morning like with brother Mike the wreck and all and all the things that went you went through in your life all those things that you went through are going fade away one day I don't make you really happy all your struggles trials tribulations we can't even really fathom it by our human mind because what happens remember our memory takes us back to it and there's a scar left somewhere because we did so and so and so and so on such and such but if you're a born-again Christian today that will go away the former things will pass away behold yes behold all things have become new behold there'll be no cancer in heaven behold there'll be no scars in heaven behold there'll be no nervousness in heaven why can't we have a little of it now because I thought Heaven I thought we were in Heavenly places right here hey man and I want the world to think we're crazy they thought Jesus was crazy they called him not just the devil they called him the prince of devils but he was God he was more God than me than you are and the world just despised him so well they despise you when we come to this Capstone the son of man Revelation is going to make us different brother random said when no sales open think about it you take brother Branham he had preached in the 50s and all the way up to 1962 he had read the scripture on Revelations uh 6 verse 1. right horse my horse went riding out with a bow conquering him to conquer he preached the mighty conqueror when it was the devil the whole time yeah he had come to a place though where the son of man Revelation had to take over when the seals open that's why he said it become a brand new book that's why he said thousands of my friends were what go away from me because what thousands of Jesus's friends went away from him when he said I am my father are one when he come to Matthew 24 and he said there'll be perilous times you're going to be what there'll be false Christ you're going to try they're going to try to deceive you they're going to try to deceive the very elective possible and they didn't like him for that that's when they killed him remember after Matthew 24 is when they put him on the cross so the son of man Revelation but look we got to get this Revelation first we've got to get so Sanctified that God has pulled all that junk out of us and that we got to what have Godly virtue Godly knowledge Godly tempers Godly patience brotherly kindness and all those different things we got to come to it yes help us that's what I want to do I want it to help us yes um for soul is the will of God that we're doing well doing you may put to silence listen the only way you're going how did Jesus put him to silence how did Jesus put the devil to silence the devil takes him up on a a pinnacle of the church I'll tell you something right there Satan was comfortable in church hello somebody he took him up on the pentacle of the temple yeah right and he showed him all this and said this is all yours if you'll worship me Jesus said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and then he said the last thing and Satan had to leave him what it wasn't that he formed this great miracle or pull this great ball of Fire now he just quoted him the word correct because he was the word you said well I don't get nothing when I quote the word try to become it know that you're the word first if you know you're the word first then that helps a lot amen we've got to know folks that we know that we know amen because we can and will be deceived if we're not born again we will be deceived there is no other way there is no in between you're either true or false I hope we get that in our heart but when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the things that you profess to have that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight every inch in other words you're going to fight every inch going up that statue of perfect it's not going to be perfect man it's not going to be just God's going to lay it in your lap man you got to fight for it fight sleep some of you don't even fight that you get all wiggled in you get down and down all right if I had a cactus and a bowling ball I'd put that Cactus behind your head and I put that bowling ball on your hands with your feet right up underneath it fall asleep one time you'll see one either your toes are gonna get master your head's gone look we're all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by what by the word you're not tried by the devil's word you're Tried by the word of God see if you'll be loyal what to the word of God am I with me when The Showdown comes this and there is going to be a showdown that's why the battle is up here the Battleground is here there's going to be a showdown where one day you're going to say Satan death you have no dominion over me anymore and just as Jesus stood up one day and said all power and Heaven and Earth been given unto me you're going to be able to say the same thing when The Showdown comes what are you going to make that's it and he that cannot stand for the world he's an illegitimate child and not a son and daughter of God certainly not but look the spiritually minded catches the word now look catches the word catches the word here's the hard one it's okay to catch it line up with it and the spirit comes down now look if you do these things I'm gonna read we're gonna read a minute about brother Brown if you catch the word line up with a word and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and what takes that person or what possesses that person possesses that vessel you're gonna be possessed to one of the two all right we're gonna read how brother Brown does that in just a few minutes now remember talking about the three Hebrew children I want you to understand the trials that we go through free the different ones all y'all that go to we all we all go through trials I was telling brother um well Luis have trial you know been going through for a couple years I'm still alive but she's still alive looks pretty good be in the shape she was supposed to be in I like it when you're not in the shape you're supposed to be in because the doctor said you should be this because they're looking at the book we're looking at Dr Jesus in his book which said by my stripes you're healed by my stripes you're healed but we all got to go through something listen your demon is not my demon my demon is not yours everybody with me and we all have Spirits I'll talk to you about that the other day we all have a spirit around us of different things all right but look it delivered them from the from the bonds in other words we got to know that when we go through these trials when we go through these trials it's for our what Perfection not for tearing us down if for something to build character to what to sense that crack up because listen you may not see that crack but God does yes right God knows where that crack is and guess what the devil is right over his shoulder looking at the same crack he's looking at and the devil does what tries to go around God and stick his old nasty hand in that crack I'm sure it's never happened to y'all but y'all pray for me but look you have to stand on that decision like they did and it all worked together for the good so you stand listen I read your quote the other day brother Robert said when you've done all you can do stand there don't go backwards don't quit Church don't quit reading your Bible don't say this ain't the message ain't right don't say God don't hear my prayer stand on what you got if you'll stand there long enough God's got to do something it never hurt him it loosed them your trial will loose you from whatever like my kitty cat thing and I appreciate all y'all want to give me cats but I'll find my own men the Lord will do that if you don't mind I don't want that when the kids from Ohio sent us either that poor cat looked like he'd been run over by a truck I'll find my own thank you but listen you say that's simple but just like I told you a couple years ago when I said something about a preacher I shouldn't have said that bothered me bothered me and bothered me but boy when I call that brother and said hey I said something about you I shouldn't say I shouldn't say it I said would you please forgive me guess what I was heading toward the furnace because I was bound by that I was bound by not thinking right I was bound by something I had done in the past and I was bound but as I headed toward that what what's the worst what's the the worst thing you do in your life say I'm sorry boy don't get quiet on me I'm gonna preach anyhow I'm sorry or I was wrong y'all pray for me if that's not for y'all just it's for me so what a man has to do sometimes look is come out and make his stand get the thing out yes and get him out of the thing so he can get the thing out of him that's why we come to church I believe we come to church to get the thing out of us amen that's why I come here why else would you come here you don't come here to get to be you know well me and Michael we've seen each other three times this week that's wonderful no we both coming what fellowshipped under the word of God and we've become better people because of it all right now there's a perfect way in a permissive way and I feel if God here on the platform and I'm going to stop when we get done with this and read these quotes that you got in your hand can show me things that's been done in my room and so forth he's able to tell me where he wants me and what he wants me to do look but I feel as long as I've got it all hooked up in other words if I put myself first I feel like he won't put his hand on it as long as I'm doing it everybody with me and that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back God can't fight your battles remember I told you there's a scripture that says if you'll not do that it'll keep coals on their head all right and you're fighting it yourself we got to stop fighting amen ourself God's already got the battle one we just don't need to get in the way the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is what a committal to God yes amen all right let's stop right there and let's read this pull your quotes out here they won't be on uh they'll be posted online for the brothers and sisters in Ohio I'm sorry I wasn't able to put them on the screen let's look at the second page Queen of Sheba 1961. always remember Church God's words are true everybody with me everybody there second page page number two we'd be on the back side of the page you got I believe the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass look if you can look at it in the right way now watch how he's going but remember here's been my standard in life now what a greater pattern messenger than brother Branham and for us to pattern ourselves after him everybody with me if God wanted somebody else to carry this perfect word he'd give it to somebody else but he give it to William Branham amen so listen if we listen to 1100 of his sermons and say Amen you need to say Amen to this quote right here too okay everybody with me all right wake up so you can read I have tried to do this the first thing I want to find out whether it's the will of God or not how many of us do that don't raise your hand because most of you would be lying if you raise your hand anybody with me all right I'm sorry I'm in your face a little today but guess what this is real this is life all right this is life we want to go ahead and do something or go ahead and say well I think this is right come on no how many times have I told you tonight listen I got a quote here somewhere and I believe I left it in there where brother Brown said brother Brown said if you start wrong you're going to end wrong if you'll go back and start right you'll end right but you'll never ever end right if you start wrong think about that you won't I want to find out whether it's the will of God or not then I know it's God's will all right ratchet one up everybody with me we're going up one one notch he's found it was the will of God so he's going to the next step the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it all right what am I going to get out of this and what is my this is what I'm saying for brother Brown what is my congregation going to get out of it what is my brethren and my sister is going to get out of this all right watch the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing then if the look watch if it's the will of God number one and my objective is right number two and my motive is right part of number two is right I have faith that'll be done because first it's the will of God and my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory so there's no selfish motive we go back to the selfish part there's no selfish motive about it if you have a selfish motive it won't work all right so stop right there if you have a selfish motive it will not work I'm going to do this remember what brother Brown said one time about brotherly kindness or somewhere in there he said he said it's not that if you'll scratch my back I'll scratch yours right he said if your back itches I'll scratch yours whether you scratch mine or not now it's hard for us to do hey man don't be a score keeper you know it wouldn't bother it's like brother Dale I always said you can give him a thousand gifts and not live what he preaches and that Thousand Gifts won't do him or you one good it just Heats coals on you but live what he preached and you don't ever have to give him but you can't give him a bigger gift because you've gave him ten thousand whirls you give him your life you've given your your wife your kid your family all everything has been dedicated wow I just saw that everything Everything You Touch everything you do there's no selfish motive about it if your objective is to make money for yourself oh if your objective is to make money for yourself or something why you'll never succeed and then try to do something outside of the will of the lord it's not going to work to begin with amen so there is genuine Faith but you must come into the real channel of God to have that genuine Faith what is the channel of God go back up to read number one make sure it's the will of God number two make sure it's the your objective and your motive is right and then what have faith that it'll be done everybody with me on that so there is genuine Faith but you must come into the real channel of God to have that genuine Faith you must come into that channel to have what virtue knowledge you got to come into that same channel to have these virtues living in your life there's human faith and then there's faith of God okay and you must have a Godly Faith to believe now then to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you the renewing of your mind have the mind of Christ listen the mind of Christ is not going to ever tell you do something wrong you will override you'll override God a lot of times and try to do something on yourself on your own and guess what happens failure failure that was an old brother one time and Lord blessed him my love brother anyway and he said the Lord told him now the Lord told me that's what he told us the Lord told him to get an extra job on Sunday so he could send that whole check of his to Mission work uh that don't work right that ain't that you got to go back to number one you can't go back to number one that wasn't the will of God or he actually turned against his own word right so this brother for about a year worked on Sunday got like paid double time oh I mean it looked good he was given missions but he absolutely backslid quit going to church now he's back in church now but he just it was a wreck his motive and objective was not right but go back to it now listen this motive and objection may have been right to him but it wasn't the will of God the very first day all right now if you say I'm gonna work Saturday and get paid double time okay all right I'm gonna work a little extra during the week but don't ever think God's gonna give you a job on Sunday well praise the Lord just a minute look committed to God and God will take care of it and then he talks about we talk about the Army we'll kind of skip through this a little bit more where's the Battlefront we know where it's at it's in our mind all right it's not fighting this over here even even Paul told us he said look you're not fighting people I'm not fighting people today we're fighting demons listen demons is what gets mad you don't get mad the demons inside of you get mad now see that made you mad we all got them we'll praise the Lord believe it or not we do thank you brother Kylie look I believe he's been dressing them though for 60 years I believe he's been training and dressing a bride getting her ready now remember we got to make ourselves ready but what does he do the Army brother Donnie now the Army gave you the best of equipment all right and they gave it to you and said here all right take it take it here okay that's the best clothes that's the best armor the best gun the best bullets and everything I'll give it to you all right here you go and brother Ronnie goes oh thank you man that's great I appreciate that you gonna die thank you you're gonna die they gave you the best equipment for you to live and you throwed it away you're gonna die so what do you equip us with it but we gotta put it on we got to put it on we got the what head toward the furnace they didn't run away from it they went toward it amen and I don't believe they were poked into it I believe they said well you know what they said before they got close to it they said God be God if he's going to take us out then he's just going to take us out but if not we're not going to go back and bow down to that so the greatest battle ever fought in her mind but what'd he do he gave us something to come back with to fight with he gave us armor he gave us all the things we needed let's don't throw him in a closet unless it's your prayer closet yeah then you go in there and put them on all right there has to be a place selected we know that where is it it's in our mind that Battleground begins in the human mind there's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was begun and that's because that decisions are made from the mind decisions that's where you make decisions from the mind and we we are talking about being selfish so let's let's get skipped through all that brother Brown talks about being he isn't he was not selfish and a Christian life means you're not selfish you want to give away you want to what you want to stand behind the pulpit and sweat and have your voice all messed up brother Dale did it for all those years while we was out playing thank you characters of Victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic power with character is fit to rule head toward the fire not away from it if you didn't go through trials listen let me say this without hurting your feelings again the trials that we go through here are temporary we're not going to remember them anymore and you know what happens after years there might have been things that we did way back when we were young kids that we've forgotten about I mean do you remember sisters you remember the exact pain you had when you had a baby no right some of you had to you remember the exact pain no you just had the baby now back then you were in the exact pain all right ask Jim she'll tell you exact pain she didn't have anything for like 12 hours finally she had Hannah been a storm ever since so she was born on a stormy night Josh was not he she was he was born um on a beautiful Sunday afternoon if y'all been reading the CEOs or listening to the seals he was born on April the 9th April the 22nd May 22nd sorry well the seals were being priest daddy said Nanny's going to the hospital said our first grandbaby is going to be born so it's in there somewhere in one of the seals but uh and mama was standing up there like a soldier she was wondering if we'd had the baby at home I reckon but we didn't we had it at home we had it at the hospital but look these are gifts of God that's what I want us to understand we all talk about uh we want to speak in tongues I would enjoy somebody speaking tongues and interpret all right I would enjoy that it would be nice it would be able to to to to say you know somebody stand up and say well well that's that the Lord if sister Anna don't go home that way go home 51. because it on Guilford highway or on uh County Line Road there's going to be a wreck they'll say at the Lord and there'll be an interpretation that says that where she can hear it that'd be wonderful but now every service it's not going to happen it's for edification not tearing down that's why brother Brian said you got to do it right even though it's the right thing to say if you say it in the wrong time it disrupts the service but these virtues though are something that you have inside of you that you carry into this room with and you go out of this room with gifts of speaking in tongues like it's not something that well I just speak in tongues Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday said no no that's a gift that's a gift here it's a gift but these virtues inside of you you're a walking living breathing instrumentality of God that's what we want we want listen we want the gifts of wisdom but I want it to be the wisdom it comes up on the Statue of perfect man but look this has to be first and when you have faith virtue knowledge he's telling you to have the virtues first and then the gifts will come behind it and it'll be true they work hand in hand I would to God that we had gifts like that but see everybody talks about them last two ones we have gifts of Faith wisdom knowledge in the nine Spirits together nine of not two anybody with me on that all right I do think we ought to have the other two but it's not imperative it's imperative that we get these down right once you get these down right then the gifts will come and it'll roll off our tongue like speaking in tongues amen then the Holy Ghost come down and seals you as a unit what those cracks he's trying to get those cracks filled up why by the Holy Ghost remember why he poured into the box honey if you we know honey it gets in every crack every crevice and you can't get it out you'll swear you got everything I mean the place is clean right June yeah it's clean you turn around and walk out to the front of that store and you go Mr spot but that's what honey is it runs and it's thick enough stop up our flus that we need stopped off now there's something we need to have opened up but that box needed to what it needed to be lined with honey which brother Brown said that was white the Holy Ghost all right the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam or rib from the side here's the thing that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be god-sent and God born imitation only causes confusion and that's what we were talking about this morning so let's read the rest of these right here I want to read these the right mental attitude now listen let's go to page number one and read these that'll help you stay awake a little bit expectations 1950 brother Brown said we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what you look for it's the mental attitude that you have mental listen your soul if you're born again when you walked into the door it didn't need to be revitalized it's Eternal it's the fire of God it's dunamis everybody with me but when you walked in here you walked in here with a spirit hey yeah memory reason conscious affects and Imagination and probably another one we all drug in everybody with me so what happens is you got to take right here this is the Battleground which one do you which one are you going to yield to all right remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude toward any promise of God it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal sick people huh we've seen that many times ma'am several several years ago sister Gail was sitting there she was certain so bad she couldn't move I mean she was trying to move to get her back better and I was just preaching away and all of a sudden a big smile came over her face and she was just you know she's looked like something just fell over and she told me after the service she said you said something she don't remember what it was she said you said something she said it just went away just like that that's the way a gentile is supposed to be healed he shouldn't need an emotion the Bible says why the word was being preached the Holy Ghost fell on the people you can get the Holy Ghost without coming up here and getting shook to death everybody with me that's to me that's the right way of getting it anyway you can have a lot of emotion and never get it but when you're sitting back there and you're hurting and I mean hurting spiritually when you're sitting back there hurting spiritually and all of a sudden God comes and just waves you over with just a just a warm feeling and all that stuff leaves you and gets out and you're like whoa that to me you put that down right there and the devil can't say I think he just felt good I I I think you just you're just a little cold and that's why them chills went up your spine that brother just moves you around a little bit in it and it excited you a little bit but when you're sitting back there and the word of God just bathes you and you just get this feeling you're like oh man where'd that come from enjoy that then you can say devil no emotion I did have a a little bit of a sensation but there was no emotion involved I just believe what that man was saying what did Hattie Wright do she wasn't in church she went into great Revival brother random wasn't under the anointing oh he what he was standing in the kitchen table talking to some brothers and Hattie was in another room listening to the conversation Mary or Martha whichever one y'all were preaching on another night you know Mary and Martha want she heard the conversation and she just probably stuck her head in and said brother Brown that ain't nothing but the truth and the third poll the greatest power that ever was fell into that room and said whatever you asked for God will give it to you wow Marshall look let's finish reading this and I'll read this right here it doesn't take get of healing to heal sick people to meet Satan watch it anywhere if you're a Christian and defeat him on any if you're a Christian and defeat him on any grounds that he could stand on when Jesus was here on Earth he was the fullness of the godhead body all the power was in him in other words paraphrase all he done was Tim give him the word 1951 The Hours come not uh e17. now the right mental attitude all you along here he's talking about the people that come into prayer line do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude your right mental attitude toward God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess that see don't let the devil know that remember brother Brown said if I say it he said Satan will fight it he said but if I keep it in my heart yeah the devil can't get to it don't let the devil know it always say I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil one more time don't testify nothing of the devil and when you accept him as your healer don't never act like you're sick wow are crippled anymore believe that you're healed take him in his word then it's all over on God now not you you transfer every bit of that over to God and say God this is what you said when you meet him on the right grounds you give it to him and say you said that and you know what if he don't act immediately continue to stand right there stand right there laughs believe that you're healed take him in his word then it's all over on God and not you see as long as you take God at his word then the word will produced will produce what it's promised to do amen let's go to 1960. may I go on record now saying this I believe that the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can take the right what attitude your attitude what toward any promise your attitude what determines your altitude also how high you can go with God look watch this if you can take the right attitude toward that promise for the promise is a seed a seed goes into the ground and if it's germatized seed got life in it it'll bring forth its kind if it's put in what the proper place if a seed is put into the ground Jesus said the word of God was a seed a man so so how are you going to get your relief how are you going to get your healing how are you going to get your salvation from the seed word of God amen the word of God quickening in your heart put in the right place put it in the right atmosphere put in the right dirt we're all just dirt look the word of God was the seed a man sowed and he was a man that sowed it I like the way brother around he and he was the man that sold it and then if the word of God is a seed and the seeds put in proper condition go back up to 19. whatever we read over there in 19 uh 61. take what brother Rob said will of God motive right objective right and have faith all right if you've done that right here if you've done that right here the seeds put in proper condition in a Heart full of Faith it'll make every promise live now see he's talking about promises living that's me and you you and I are the promise of God you and I are the promise of God in the end time to destroy Satan by what by your feelings no by your emotions no by how much of the words you are it'll make every promise live bring forth what it's promised all right let's go over to the back side and read the last one we already read the first one up there in 1961. 1963 show us the father and I go on record he's done said that twice I say this about the word of God being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God he will bring it to pass look if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was to you he thought every bit of it now to us if you believe that promise was to you well that's not me no you know what Peter said stood upon a dead Pentecost he said repent be baptized name of Jesus Christ remission sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for what for the promise was given to you and your children praise the Lord you and your children and then they're far off if you get in your position what is this right here positionally placing you in the body where you're supposed to be foot hand toe uh hair I whatever it is little pinky it doesn't matter if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was to you not to your neighbor not to your wife to you and then what you do is it you take it and you live it out you present it then to the world God is going to present us to the world he's going to stand on the day of judgment and he's going to have all of his Saints behind him and he's going to declare I promise you he's going to declare he said these people fought and overcome and now they are going to judge you and some of them are going to be shaking in the boots because they remember what they did wrong to you and they remember that they didn't do right they remember that they didn't do what God Said through us through us I mean all of us or there's going to be going to be group two six round of his sister Anna's going to be standing there one day and she's going to say that guy changed my tire on side of the road well he may not know one thing about God right but God said because you did it to one of my little ones you've done it unto me enter into the joy of the Lord amen they won't get to live in the city but you know what they'll be just as Eternal As You Are but you'll be able to sit down sister Anna and sit down under a tree for a couple thousand years and tell him how your fire got lit and why God did what he did through you because God was in you because he didn't know how God got in you because he didn't know that God did wasn't in hell we knew God wasn't in him right he may have heard a preacher he may have turned it down but eternal life was going to come through me and you and today folks into a Dying World this is all they got this is the only hope they got they can't get it out there come on this is the only hope of Redemption full Redemption is only hope is with the bride you call it what you want to call it but the message of the hour was given to us for full Redemption and to take full Redemption is going to redeem what us first then the Earth then the people have to watch on judgment wow wow think of that it won't give you a big head you'll thank God yes thank you thank you for presenting it to me and I said yes or I said that ain't nothing but the truth and I didn't have to stand judgment I didn't have to go through the tribulation I didn't have to watch Israel in 144 000. I don't have to watch an atomic bomb I don't have to worry about atomic bombs they're worried about now Russia having dirty bombs and dropping little Bombs over here and little Bombs over here our Prophet told us everybody believe brother Brown said is our Prophet right he said they want an atomic bomb hit the earth until we're out of here I'll take that because look because we are equipped for the battle go and read the countdown read the countdown he'll tell you we are equipped for this end time we're equipped for this not just breaking the sound barrier we're going to break the eternity barrier because there's nobody on Earth Eternal but the bride but there's a whole bunch of them over there in the sixth dimension a lot more than is over here everybody with me there's a lot more over there and they are here but they're all coming here because of what death being destroyed in me and you but we got to show god listen we know and I'm telling you one more time that we these are requirements so we have to go through this is a course that you can't miss this is a course you can't go from first grade to 12th grade and Miss all the other grades you got to go up this statue of perfect man one virtue at a time now all the virtues will be working in you but you got to come to a place one time and say all right that's it I got this I'm working I got this I'm working what are you gonna do God's gonna try you oh bro why are you coming here you're not gonna get but just like I said this morning by about the little cat I mean that's to me that's a victory that's a victory may not be for you some of you still don't like cats I'm praying for you somebody said amen we pray for the sake but ain't it the little things though that once you get rid of those little things that you you there's got to be listen if you're a Christian today right we'll close right here we'll read these later on because I wanted to talk about a double-minded man the Bible says the double-minded man is unstable in all his ways you know what double mind means wavering uncertain doubting divided in Interest Who divides Satan divides God does not divide he's a separator he separates us from out there brother I'm calling him a segregationalist because he separates us from the world but listen a double-minded person is wavering uncertain and doubty how are you going to build now if you had this Foundation right here and it was uncertain wavering in other words built on shift and sand you ever been out in the ocean and the wave come in you put your foot down all that sand underneath goes right out from under your foot why because it's sinking sand but you can't do that with a rock you go put your foot on a rock that Rocket Gibraltar has been there for thousands of years and haven't moved an inch hey man that's what we want to be on that rock and not be on sink and sand not be double minded well I think I might but I and I want and go back to this and read what brother Brown said to do kids young adults us how to make our decision is that it that's it right there find out it's the will of God make sure it lines up with the word in other words right then check your motive and objective not his yours and then have faith yes you stand on it if you do those things stand right here if you want to go up this statue of perfect Man start at the we've started we've got the foundation I believe ready to go but you can't be double-minded well I think I I don't think I need those I think I'll do this up here and I think I'll do this over here that's not God God's requirements are that we go up that statue of perfect man the curriculum is already said but listen the rewards is already there too remember I said before you're not going to get rid of all your problems but you're going to be able to go through them and handle them and make them a victory where the world when they go through something they need appeal come on somebody they need a pill they need a psychiatrist they need to go this they need to go dry out for a couple weeks they need to go there am I hitting something but what do we do when we go through a trial we're going hey when's the next one if it made me feel this good give me another one oh now see y'all say I'm crazy y'all looking at me like no I don't want another one I got delivered from being a cat killer okay let me have my day and like I said again don't set no caps on my porch I'll find my own me and Tabby's going to have a talk before we have to do this me and Jim's gonna have to have a talk first can I go home with some of y'all today she says she's allergic to him so am I they die every time I get around them not anymore not anymore but watch this let's read this right here and then we'll close let musicians come on a person of virtue I'm talking about all the virtues a person of virtue makes the progression from knowing what is right to doing what is right good to know listen to First step and Jesus said ain't doing you no good you're just going by rituals you're just coming to church you're just coming because brother white said you need to come to church no you need to come to church like brother Brown said because you want to you have a desire yes he or she intentionally chooses what to say do in value reaching beyond the good toward the best in every situation a virtuous person knows that they have an opportunity to honor the Lord and reflect him to others now that was a that I got that from a preacher on the internet not a message preacher either and that's profound in every situation a virtuous person knows that they have an opportunity to honor the Lord and reflect them to others let's stand our feet the problem they have with now listen let me let me just just for a minute the problem they have is is they can't live every word so God don't have to honor everything they do I said not everything right God can't honor something non-word but if we line ourselves up and get behind the word that that's a prophet brought that we look through the filter of the message and see what the word is saying and we get behind that or actually get in it then we've got a one up on the world but now problem kids all y'all you're gonna look at people and they're gonna say why y'all wear dresses why y'all why y'all not cut your hairs and man I can trim mine up and I can be up I'm gonna be gone in 15 minutes and it takes 15 minutes for y'all to find your hair sometimes where'd it go but they got something then people the world don't have they've got faith in what God Said in his word that a virtuous woman in other words dresses herself right a virtuous woman acts right clothes herself right knows what to do knows that her hair is her glory knows that she's to present herself not to the world so that everybody can see amen but then she can give herself to her husband what a great thing just like us giving ourselves to Christ and him what the Bible says we're accepted in the Beloved I want to be accepted but you're not going to be accepted if you're a prostitute now you might have been one I'm talking spiritually if you might have been well even naturally but God if you take God at his word and say God this is what I'm going to live from this day forward I'm going to try my best to read my Bible pray listen to the message of the hour come to church come to Sunday school do everything and then God you know what he said you know boy brother I'm saying if you motivate objectives right just have faith that that you're going to grow have faith God's going to heal you have faith God's going to give you the Holy Ghost if you're thinking Holy Ghost today just have faith that you got it already what I read here with brother Brown said don't tell the devil that you're sick don't tell the devil you don't have faith don't testify nothing of the devil I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil nothing nothing don't testify anything of the devil all right you know why because if you give him an inch you what takes a mile don't give him an inch give God an inch and it'll be Eternal let's sing a song God bless you you are my refuge you are my refugee [Music] place you are my red and when the storms underneath your wings I rejoice once again you are my refugee reviews [Music] when a storm is Raging underneath your wings [Music] went at the store underneath your wings not concrete not stale I Rejoice [Music] they told us you know in the Book of Psalms they said run into there run into that Refuge be hid in the Pavilion that God has put up for me and you it's so strange that brother Brown read that Psalms for the Rapture message you're my refuge run into my shelter watch what we got to do before we go take a rapture we got to be what under his wing under his shelter not concrete not Steel feathers underneath his feathers you know what humanly you'd rather try stealing concrete right humanly speaking if you had here comes the bomb you've got a bomb shelter made out of concrete a bomb shelter made out of steel and you've got an eagle there with feathers out like this bro John we going to one of these over here but God said go to that one these are going to be destroyed but underneath his wing underneath his wing is eternal life that may get you temporary but let me tell you something about them about them bunkers then people just don't realize that when all the when all hell breaks loose and all the atomic explosion comes out it's gonna be months before they can come out of them bunkers and they're gonna have to bring something they're gonna be breathing Atomic junk they gonna die that's right you know why because they didn't take up some feathers if they just start giving themselves to God and get placed under his wing you know what they'll make it but the world don't want that the world does not want they want technology they won't they want somebody to put something together [Music] so I can hide under like we're talking about the the shot and everything they want everybody now is going to take any all kind of shot they got one for flu they got one for uh shingles they got one for this one for that and that's okay take them but wait what if one day we can't get to a shot or you can't get to your blood pressure medicine when you can't buy or sell that means drugs too we better start conditioning ourselves not not taking them but say God when the time comes I'm gonna have to trust in you but I'm gonna start having to trust in you right now I'm gonna trust in you right now and then let's develop into that if we need to have blood pressure medicine guess what you know what an old Indian said one time he said me don't need Pharmacy God put everything I need in ground we've just developed Walgreens and something in the past hundred years before that what'd you do you ate a root you boil some tea you put this together with that together and the old Indian a lot of our things that we got come from the Indians because you know what they believed in God they believed there was a god they believed there was somebody that put their provisions on Earth so they can live so they give them all the herbs and everything they needed that's what the Bible says he give the herbs you know for us to what live by and that's okay but that's what they're doing they're mashing up all the herbs giving it to you a little pill but we got trust in God let's learn to trust in God he's our refuge the world's not the doctors are not this is our refuge he's our hiding place Satan can't find you when you're in Christ he can find you everywhere else when you get in Christ he can't find you your head you're sheltered try brother Brown priest out because when we run into that Pavilion that's Jesus Christ that's when the Rapture is going to take place problem is we're running around here trying to figure something out to see if we can make it make it through because of this make it through because of that we're only going to make it through because of God that's the only thing we're going to make it through is because God's gonna give us the provisions We need he will absolutely he is he has recruited us hey man he's recruited us he's given us everything we need every weapon we need he'd give it he's already given to us now let's use it take the sword and take it to the heart of the devil all right and man we're going to go downstairs and have uh some cake and ice cream and honor brother Dale and got some gifts down there for him for being uh 46 or so years now being the pastor of the church and we appreciate him we love him it's like brother Louise said he's not he's not been quieting maybe maybe he has around here but no his voice is going all over the world hey man and I appreciate that there's not a lot of people you can say that about but we can say that about about brother Dale that that when we come to the when we come to the uh um we're not going to come to the Judgment but we're gonna we're gonna go to that other dimension to the wedding suffering they're going to say where'd y'all come from well we from Lula and they all they all ain't they gonna do like they did down here they go really no they're gonna say man y'all made it yeah we made it you didn't think it was going to but we did how'd you make it remember the old thing where they'd get over here and they're going how'd that person make it and then the person over here is going how'd that person make it I'm not going to worry as long as I see you there I ain't gonna worry about how we get there hey man as long as we are able to walk on streets of gold as long as we're able to be at the marriage supper together I don't care climb over scream Hey listen it's a battle and all great warriors were made when the battle was the hottest all great warriors it was not in time I don't know anybody that's been a hero that that the Army has decorated that was sitting at the mess hall think about it now they did have to go eat then five star generals that were going to be but where did they win their awards at where'd they win all their their um their things in the battle they persevered they won the victory by what and if if man can give you something to make it God ought to be able to give you a lot more to make it with so trust in him don't trust in man don't trust in anything trust in God trust in God sent people like brother day on different ones brother Mike altique man pray for him we need him we still need these Warriors around we don't we don't need to we need them in the front we don't want him in the back we need him in the front hey man let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this time that we have that we have to talk about you Lord to The Possession of the greatest people on the face of the Earth we can name many people truly the MacArthur's the patents the Shermans and all the different ones the Robert E Lee's and we we can talk about all these Great War generals but the Greatest Warrior one day stood and said I'll take it so that they can be victorious I'll go to a cross and I'll die but I'm coming out of that grave and all power in Heaven and Earth is being given unto me and I'm going to now give it to my bride and we're going to defeat Satan right here in his own grounds a squatter on our property father you've given us the equipment to drive him off and I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that all sickness that all trouble and trials as far out as my voice goes Lord even the brother Mike Lord we I pray that you would just drive all that all that pain and that hurting you drive it away from him let it be a miracle father Lord we believe in a miracle working God we believe in a God that said oh don't ask little things I spit things Lord I pray that when they start working on his shoulder even after they finish tomorrow that Lord it won't be as bad as they thought that you've already set the healing power begun in his shoulder Lord because he needs that arm to hold the Bible he needs that arm to write notes he's left-handed just like me and it left hands what's messed up Lord he needs that to do his job and we pray that she would help him now and touch him father bless each one here Lord bless us as we go down and and honor our pastor on on appreciation month that you'll keep him strong Lord and be with each one Lord take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit Lord be with all the ministers around the world father all the ones just fighting this battle that we become Victorious Because of You Lord we ask these things in Jesus name amen you're dismissed brother Aaron will be speaking Wednesday night just keep us in prayer God bless you you're dismissed [Music]
