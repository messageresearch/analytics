[2:54] honeymoon when you get married right you
[2:56] might go to the Bahamas symbolic so we
[3:09] don't want nobody behind right so we
[3:19] want to love everyone and have
[3:23] compassion on each other especially that

[3:47] something listen we don't have
[3:49] compassion on each other let's go to
[3:55] Ephesians 6 verse 36 38
[4:13] he said Ben grieve not the Holy Spirit
[4:16] of God were you thoraseal until that day
[4:18] a redemption said let all bitterness and
[4:22] wrath and anger and clamour and evil
[4:25] speaking be put away from you with all
[4:28] malice and be kind one to another
[4:30] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[4:32] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[4:36] forgiven you 12:3 he said therefore
[4:48] whatever you have spoken in darkness
[4:51] shall be hurt in the light and that the
[4:54] truth has spoken it in the ear in the
[4:59] closet Chubby's proclaim upon the
[5:02] housetops restoration of a lesser
[5:24] brother says he says are strictly and
[5:28] Melina's I believe in a millennium I
[5:30] believe all these Hebrew prophets and
[5:32] through the ages spoke on that Golden
[5:35] Age and millennium coming I believe
[5:38] we're going to have it we will reign
[5:41] here with him a thousand years what
[5:46] think he approached the verses Sunday
[5:49] over in a great millennium we're just
[5:51] going to think oh I just know would mean
[5:55] this way what would I have done see how
[5:58] much more could have done if I just know
[6:02] what I was going to be well now you
[6:05] don't but my faith we had faith is the
[6:09] substance of things hoped for the
[6:11] evidence of things not seen
[6:13] is that right see faith that doesn't see
[6:16] it he doesn't with his eyes he sees
[6:20] inward eyes see all Christian armor the
[6:24] whole armor Christianity is supernatural
[6:27] there's nothing to be seen the whole
[6:30] person deal with the supernatural there
[6:41] you know just what's Armin where's the
[6:43] front Oh what think you encrusted 53
[6:53] look a 1953 question Vanessa just leg
[7:02] goes in that time just elect takes the
[7:04] millennium all the umbrella what type of
[7:07] people should we be I want to live
[7:09] through the millennia there lay aside
[7:13] every weight and the sin that so easily
[7:15] 7 Elmo says something wrong oh there's
[7:20] something this way pray for him and keep
[7:23] on moving let your wonderful time to be
[7:27] said towards God nobody else makes it
[7:30] you make it well there's going to be an
[7:32] elect was going to live through the
[7:34] millennium age and we will move him and
[7:38] hop with Christ for a thousand years and
[7:40] they shall go up to glory with him and
[7:43] return again what is the brand talk
[7:47] about that little guy in the Vice he
[7:48] said don't look to the right to the left
[7:50] look to where we want to go today
[7:53] another goal there's another one all
[7:58] questions Anessa
[7:59] Dylan was there yes 54 he said when a
[8:04] judgmental said and their books open now
[8:07] Jesus came with ten thousand times ten
[8:11] thousand up Saint then the druggie
[8:13] mental state
[8:13] here they are all around the white
[8:16] throne judgment as we went through the
[8:18] scripture with it and the books were
[8:20] opened and another book was opened which
[8:23] was the book of life and these that are
[8:26] a rapture were judging them is that
[8:28] right then they die my home and received
[8:31] their glorified bodies and lived through
[8:34] the Millennium was human white throne
[8:36] judgment judge and those he said he was
[8:40] separate the sheep from the goats and
[8:48] the water separation River City say no
[8:52] many teacher the school say that the
[8:54] promised land represent heaven but I
[8:57] think they represent the Millennium
[8:59] because they were wars and trouble still
[9:03] my promised land they come up but in my
[9:06] opinion the church tonight in the states
[9:08] of the old church age Kalish cornea
[9:11] where they were wondering about after
[9:15] refusing to walk in the light
[9:23] a 1955 results decisions
[9:27] he said we're no longer in he Joe
[9:30] so we done pulled up our tent states and
[9:33] left come through the Red Sea the blood
[9:36] of the Lord Jesus see know that all
[9:38] habits and things of life drawn the test
[9:42] master that drove us through it they're
[9:43] ballrooms linked to the cocktail lunches
[9:45] and so forth and seeing all the drunk on
[9:49] that drum like Pharaoh and his horses
[9:51] and then now we're in the wilderness
[9:54] moving along following the angel of the
[9:56] Covenant that what was spirit and
[9:59] knowing that we're on our road to a
[10:01] great land
[10:02] they'll be here during the days of a
[10:05] millennium and we're going for that
[10:07] thousand years a millennium ring he said
[10:10] now a lot of people type the promised
[10:13] land over there Palestine with heaven it
[10:16] couldn't be because they had Wars and
[10:19] things in Palestine so they don't have
[10:21] no award and so forth in heaven it's a
[10:24] type of thousand-year reign on their own
[10:26] a bit of Christ three stages of the
[10:29] journey and we're ready now nature is to
[10:31] my opinion the spiritual span to enter
[10:35] into the third scene
[10:50] that makes people that hunting I like
[10:53] this one here they said they don't
[10:59] calorie he says some time and go out of
[11:03] the down in Kentucky later brother
[11:04] Charlie cuts and he said we're a better
[11:08] brother Brandon do you think in the
[11:09] millennia and you and I was scrolled huh
[11:11] I said I don't think so charlie he said
[11:15] well we're like a so well do you think
[11:17] we will get we will when we get in the
[11:21] Millenium
[11:22] I said no they don't want to be no
[11:24] killing in the Millennium have you save
[11:26] her well well we just like it I said
[11:31] Charlie what if I could convince you
[11:33] that at one time you were a Hogg and you
[11:37] never a still higher to being to being a
[11:41] human being
[11:42] would you ever want to go back and enjoy
[11:44] the pleasures of being a hog he said no
[11:48] said see you you would be so much harder
[11:52] than the pause now you're a human you
[11:55] never want to be a hobbit anymore I said
[11:58] not multiply that by 10,000 and that's
[12:01] what you'll be when you change from here
[12:03] to what you will be you will never want
[12:07] to be you never want to be human again
[12:11] then that's right it'll be something
[12:13] different I'm so glad for the thought of
[12:16] it knowing that same day we will climb
[12:19] higher so sorry by the way it sort of
[12:24] was

[13:08] juni or doing whatever name it
[13:10] that's right Canaan is not too tight but
[13:13] I'm within here because they had Wars
[13:15] fighting killings and everything else in
[13:18] Canaan Panama is a type of the Holy
[13:20] Ghost Egypt is the world that they come
[13:24] out about wilderness it's where they
[13:27] were sanctified a calling our church
[13:29] Canaan is where they settle down with

[16:36] prophet like unto Moses he said the full
[16:39] gospel of businessman has been one of my
[16:41] great support in taking me to help
[16:45] fulfill the purpose that I believe the
[16:47] Lord's telling me to help help do that
[16:50] was to unite the body of Jesus Christ
[16:54] together that's it's my purpose to do
[16:58] that
[16:59] that's what in my heart to seek all of
[17:02] God's children in one Accord and we want
[17:05] hard moving on and I believe when that
[17:07] takes place that work will be up the
[17:11] over then and there millennium was set
[17:13] in a rapture will come 59 questions in
[17:25] answer
[17:26] I made a read back in Buda remember

[17:34] Canaan is not a type of the malignant
[17:36] theory doesn't yeah

[19:12] readings where you guys from help me out
[19:13] okay not to make Scripture but
[19:25] revelation 19 116 19 1 and after these
[19:42] things I heard a great voice of much
[19:44] people in heaven saying hallelujah
[19:46] salvation and glory and honor and power
[19:50] unto the Lord our God
[20:05] and again they said I'll do it out
[20:08] always up for ever and ever before
[20:21] and it was came out of that throne
[20:24] saying praise our God all ye his
[20:27] servants and ye that fear that came both
[20:29] small and great be plan and rejoice and
[20:49] give honour to him for the marriage of
[20:50] the lamb has come and any wife had made
[20:53] herself ready and he said on the
[21:05] meetings right to bless write blessed
[21:08] even the name we shall call unto the
[21:10] marriage supper of the lamb and he said

[21:16] God
[21:24] [Music]
[21:32] [Music]

[21:39] white horse and he that sat upon him was
[21:41] called faithful and true and then rushes
[21:45] Nestea and mouth goes a sharp sword that
[22:17] with it he should smite the nation and
[22:20] shall rule them with a rod of iron and
[22:23] he treads the winepress of the
[22:26] fierceness and wrath of Almighty God

[23:03] king to take her place and recite the
[23:06] near royal anointed temple
[23:29] b61 gabled instructions to Daniel and
[23:33] man came to mean a lot more said Oh
