[0:11] and remember remember
[0:13] just a treated
[0:15] in
[0:16] trinidad so
[0:17] i love it
[0:19] so
[0:20] we got slim crew today but anyway
[0:24] we're on brotherly kindness part two
[0:26] now if you remember last sunday we were
[0:28] talking about
[0:30] oh let's go back to that let's go back
[0:33] just a second runway kindness i'm
[0:35] telling you this is going to be the
[0:36] hinge to the whole thing is brotherly
[0:39] kindness
[0:40] like brother claude now we're talking
[0:42] about
[0:42] because it's really brotherly love
[0:45] so that love and the capstone there's
[0:47] your hands to bring the cap down you can
[0:50] have
[0:52] we'll read it next sunday paul said you
[0:55] can have all the mysteries
[0:57] have all these things working in your
[0:58] life and have not charity which is love
[1:01] you're as a sounding brass and a
[1:03] tinkling symbol so without that love
[1:06] coming down but look what holds it off
[1:09] brotherly kindness that's the last one
[1:12] that we've got to overcome
[1:14] so last sunday we were talking about the
[1:16] statue of perfect man it says then
[1:18] sixthly let's add the bible said adding
[1:20] brotherly love brother kindness now
[1:21] that's a good one right here the sixth
[1:23] seventh all right adding brother
[1:25] kindness
[1:26] when we get to that brother kindness put
[1:28] yourself in his place on the matter my
[1:30] brother sinned against me said peter
[1:32] shall i forgive him
[1:33] seven times a day he said seventy times
[1:36] seven
[1:38] all right that's 490.
[1:40] brotherly kindness now you see if her
[1:41] brother's all out of tune don't be
[1:43] impatient we didn't see
[1:45] be kind to him
[1:47] go anyway
[1:49] he said somebody said not too long ago
[1:51] how can you believe these things the way
[1:53] you do and still go to the assemblies of
[1:54] god in oneness all the rest then put
[1:57] seed brotherly kindness hoping someday
[1:58] see patient within seed temperate
[2:01] enduring with him knowledge to
[2:02] understand what he believed
[2:04] remembers in his heart that's what it is
[2:06] virtue in yourself to let it go out with
[2:09] kindness meekness to him having faith
[2:11] that someday god will bring him in
[2:13] now he uses every one of the virtues
[2:15] right there
[2:16] all right so to me brother kindness is
[2:18] bringing all those virtues together
[2:20] all right let's go to
[2:24] now and read
[2:27] according as his divine power have given
[2:29] unto us all things that pertain to life
[2:31] and godliness to the knowledge of him
[2:32] that have called us to glory and virtue
[2:35] for by giving unto us exceeding great
[2:37] and precious promises that by these you
[2:39] might be partakers of the divine nature
[2:41] having escaped the corruption that is in
[2:42] the world through lust
[2:44] and besides this
[2:46] besides all that giving all diligence
[2:48] add to your faith virtually the virtual
[2:50] knowledge and all these templates temper
[2:52] patience patience godliness and the
[2:54] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[2:56] brotherly kindness
[2:57] charity
[2:59] here's one we didn't read last sunday
[3:02] verse nine but it says for if these
[3:03] things being you have bound this promise
[3:06] they make you that you shall neither be
[3:07] barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of
[3:09] our lord jesus christ but
[3:11] he that lacketh these things is blind
[3:14] it's not that you're not born again
[3:17] but if you like the virtues you're blind
[3:19] you're blind to the other things of god
[3:22] and cannot see a far off
[3:24] and has forgotten that he was purged
[3:26] from his old sin all right
[3:28] and i want you we're going to read these
[3:30] quotes right here and then we're going
[3:31] to make a few comments
[3:35] because this is pertaining this is his
[3:37] wife
[3:38] this is sister mita
[3:41] people don't even know used to be a long
[3:42] time ago we'd go out if the neighbor
[3:44] when he was on the farm and somebody got
[3:46] sick we'd go over and cut the corn cut
[3:48] the wood and bring it in
[3:49] nowadays while you don't even know your
[3:51] neighbor's dead unless you read it in
[3:53] the paper
[3:56] is that right
[3:57] unless you read in the paper there's
[3:59] something wrong
[4:02] this is the prophet talking
[4:04] brotherly love has ceased it's awful
[4:07] here the other day i went downtown with
[4:09] my wife and there was some lady said how
[4:11] do you do sister brown i looked over to
[4:13] meet i said
[4:14] well you didn't speak to that woman
[4:17] she said yes i did i said well i didn't
[4:20] hear you she said i smiled
[4:25] i said oh that little old silly grin
[4:29] i said that's not speaking to somebody
[4:32] get out there on the street and shake
[4:34] your hand and say hello sister i'm glad
[4:36] to meet you amen brother that's what get
[4:39] back to the old-fashioned hewing line
[4:41] again where men are christians or
[4:43] christians and men and women
[4:44] live like they ought to so here's an
[4:46] example
[4:48] i want you to read this one right here
[4:50] with me
[4:53] real close
[4:55] it says 1956.
[4:57] now we are faced in the day that when
[4:59] it's prophesied to us that brotherly
[5:01] love would become a strange thing among
[5:03] people so it's the prophesy that
[5:05] brotherly love
[5:06] is going to be done away with
[5:08] now so only the true bride will have
[5:11] brotherly love then is that correct all
[5:13] right only the true bride that that has
[5:17] that in the pyramid that's what he's
[5:18] talking about here listen to this
[5:20] and it's to my humble belief that that
[5:23] is the greatest of all the gifts that
[5:26] there is in god's bible
[5:28] if the lord jesus should stand on the
[5:31] platform tonight and look me in the face
[5:33] and say i'm gonna give you your choice
[5:36] you can be a great person a great
[5:38] minister i'll give you a gift of
[5:40] preaching the gospel i'll give you a
[5:42] gift of teaching the word or i'll give
[5:44] you the gift of divine healing
[5:46] i'll give you the gift of prophecy or
[5:48] i'll make you a prophet
[5:50] or any of the fine gifts of faith any of
[5:52] the gifts that's in the bible i'll give
[5:54] them everyone to you but then i will
[5:55] withhold love from you
[5:59] or either i'll give you love and
[6:01] withhold the gift from you
[6:03] i say lord take all the gifts and let me
[6:05] have the love
[6:08] for no matter how many gifts we got they
[6:10] will never do us any good except the
[6:12] love of god is the motive behind the
[6:15] gift
[6:18] now that's pretty good list of things
[6:21] that
[6:22] most people would take that
[6:26] but remember the uh
[6:28] the prophecy of danny henry
[6:30] remember the prophecy of danny henry
[6:33] the god said it's the the way you chose
[6:35] a greater portion of heaven to be given
[6:37] to you all right
[6:39] now let's read this one right here
[6:42] now pentecost was god's vine which was
[6:44] the new vine that has grown up and these
[6:47] four destroyers has been the one that
[6:48] he's divine down now let's find out what
[6:50] pentecost had and find out what we got
[6:52] lacking
[6:54] then we ought to find out what the
[6:56] destroyers are who they are
[6:58] well what's did it now the first thing
[7:01] that pentecost produced was brotherly
[7:03] love
[7:05] now he's talking about
[7:07] original pentecost
[7:10] everybody got that he's not talking
[7:11] about azusa street
[7:13] he's talking about on the day of
[7:14] pentecost acts 2 38 he's talking about
[7:16] that group of people
[7:18] because watch because the first thing
[7:20] that pentecost producers probably love
[7:22] it tore down the middle wall of
[7:23] partitions and made a brotherhood to
[7:25] such a way they had everything in common
[7:28] in the bible
[7:29] now you remember what they did
[7:32] they sold all their possessions
[7:34] and brought it in to peter in them
[7:37] and then they distributed it out to the
[7:39] people that's the apostolic way in the
[7:42] starting of the new testament because
[7:44] remember adam and i since the fire the
[7:46] problem that god had with landonite
[7:47] since the fire they didn't give all
[7:49] that's right they only give a portion
[7:50] and kept the portion
[7:52] and paul peter tells him says why do you
[7:54] sin against the holy ghost he didn't sin
[7:55] against peter he has sinned against his
[7:57] apostles he has sent they said against
[7:59] the holy ghost
[8:00] now my question to you is
[8:04] if we got to go back to the apostolic
[8:05] way
[8:07] then we got to start selling everything
[8:09] we got and give it to brother dale and
[8:10] let him distribute it out as needed
[8:13] now are we willing to do that
[8:17] i don't see any head shaking
[8:21] that's what he said
[8:24] tore down the middle wall petition and
[8:25] made a brotherhood in such a way that
[8:27] they had everything in common in the
[8:28] bible days the brotherhood paul spoke of
[8:30] this brotherhood and he gave all the
[8:32] gifts of the pentecostal church and then
[8:33] said in first corinthians 13 though i
[8:35] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[8:37] have not this love
[8:39] which brings the brotherhood i am
[8:40] nothing and though i have the knowledge
[8:42] to understand all the mysteries of god i
[8:44] am still nothing without love
[8:46] the love of the brethren
[8:50] right right here jesus said this will
[8:51] all men know that you're my disciples
[8:53] when you have loved one for another
[8:55] that's the only way god's going to know
[8:59] this will all men know that you're my
[9:01] disciples when you have love one for the
[9:03] other
[9:04] pentecost had it
[9:06] i'm speaking pentecost meaning the first
[9:08] group of the apostles and disciples they
[9:10] had that brotherly love they wasn't
[9:12] greedy
[9:15] they sold everything they had for the
[9:17] furthering of the church
[9:20] everybody reading this
[9:25] but when i said that did something
[9:27] inside you say i ain't gonna do that
[9:30] now where was that been
[9:32] if that was the holy ghost then they had
[9:34] the statue of a perfect man up to
[9:36] brotherly kindness right they had all
[9:38] those virtues working in their life paul
[9:39] peter and james john all those first
[9:42] original disciples
[9:44] they wasn't greedy they sold everything
[9:46] they had for the furthering of the
[9:48] church
[9:49] they were so together till even when one
[9:51] heard the other one died they said let's
[9:53] go and die with him
[9:55] such a feeling
[9:56] now jesus spoke of that paul did rather
[9:59] and said let brotherly love continue
[10:01] that was in the first church but
[10:03] something taken place and there was a
[10:05] fellow come in by the name of palmerworm
[10:08] and when he began to eat on that vine of
[10:10] brotherly love he cut the very sap line
[10:12] of it
[10:14] okay
[10:16] now there's nobody going to ask to do
[10:18] that in this age
[10:20] okay even brother brown see they they in
[10:24] back in the 60s
[10:26] uh
[10:27] gene goad and
[10:29] and all them
[10:31] went out to arizona who was it goatee
[10:34] yeah mercer mercier and go they went out
[10:37] of arizona and started to commune
[10:41] had their own money had their own they
[10:42] were commune they lived in trailers and
[10:44] brothers told them not to do that see
[10:46] they were going to try to do it that way
[10:47] but you know what they did not have the
[10:49] same motive as the ones in the first
[10:51] church age or it would have worked
[10:53] because if it would have happened with
[10:55] the same motive in the first church age
[10:57] it would have to work the same way in
[10:59] this age everybody understand that so if
[11:02] something doesn't work it's because your
[11:04] motive and objective is wrong
[11:08] and god knows that god's the only one
[11:09] that knows your inner part of you that
[11:11] is wrong
[11:12] of what you've done all right
[11:16] but they let the palmer worm get in now
[11:18] let's read this right here
[11:20] he comes and preaches the palm worm
[11:22] locust caterpillar in jeffersonville the
[11:24] next thing that we'd like to say for is
[11:26] brotherly luck
[11:28] has been eaten away from the vine
[11:30] brotherly love jesus said this will all
[11:32] men know you're my disciples when you
[11:34] have love one for another the reason
[11:36] they were called christians and antioch
[11:38] because they acted like christ
[11:40] right well just what scripture said
[11:43] well let's just take an example if a man
[11:45] don't believe the same as i do i'll go
[11:47] right into his congregation and preach
[11:49] with him just preach what he believes
[11:50] and go right ahead and let it go because
[11:52] i love him by the fruits you know them
[11:55] if they don't believe it and they
[11:56] haven't got brotherly love they drop out
[11:58] disagree fall away i'll have nothing to
[12:00] do with it why don't you come to me and
[12:02] talk to me about it you don't know what
[12:04] i believe to see
[12:05] what difference does it make anyhow
[12:08] well i believe it's who i believe jesus
[12:11] christ
[12:12] i've never left a meeting yet with a bad
[12:14] taste as i know of
[12:15] now remember that's what billy paul said
[12:17] about brother brown he never knew who
[12:19] his enemies you never knew he knew who
[12:21] they were but you never knew who didn't
[12:24] like brother brown and who did he
[12:25] treated him all the things
[12:28] but by discernment i know he he knew
[12:30] exactly
[12:32] who liked him and who did i've never
[12:34] left a meeting yet with a bad taste as i
[12:36] know
[12:36] of but you see brotherly love has been
[12:39] all discarded and paul saying it in
[12:41] corinthians let brotherly love continue
[12:43] but brotherly love has been taken away
[12:46] now if the prophet said it's been taken
[12:48] away then there's got to be a
[12:50] restoration of that because we got to be
[12:52] restored back to the faith of the
[12:53] fathers right that was the message of
[12:54] the hour to bring back he was the prime
[12:56] example
[12:59] now come upon this scripture in
[13:00] leviticus because jesus quotes the
[13:02] scripture we don't know many
[13:04] times that jesus is called the old
[13:07] testament it's not something fresh he's
[13:09] just taking the old testament and
[13:11] expounding on it in leviticus 19 18 thou
[13:14] shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge
[13:17] against the children of thy people now
[13:19] spiritually this is the children of thy
[13:21] people right okay
[13:23] but thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[13:25] thyself
[13:27] that was in leviticus that was under the
[13:29] law
[13:30] i am the lord
[13:32] now in matthew 5 43
[13:34] jesus as you have heard you have heard
[13:36] that it has been said thou shalt love
[13:38] thy neighbor and hate thy enemy
[13:40] see they put this in
[13:41] when the pharisees come they put that in
[13:44] all right because it does not say here
[13:46] to hate your enemy it says love your
[13:47] neighbor as yourself
[13:49] okay
[13:51] it doesn't say love those who love you
[13:52] and hate those who hate you you know me
[13:54] it says love
[13:55] but i say unto you
[13:58] see he's bringing it thou shalt love thy
[14:00] neighbor and they have interjected
[14:04] in from the old testament
[14:06] and hate that enemy
[14:08] because you know you can pull things out
[14:09] of the bible says an eye for an eye on a
[14:11] tooth for a tooth you know you can bring
[14:13] those things in under the law and and
[14:16] said if somebody murders you then you go
[14:18] murder it murders your brother you go
[14:19] murder somebody you know they so they
[14:21] interjected this but i say unto you love
[14:24] your enemy
[14:26] that's what he brought
[14:28] you have to love your enemy
[14:30] as a
[14:31] human being but you don't
[14:33] you don't have to that's correct
[14:35] no
[14:37] we'll get into that in just a minute
[14:39] or either next sunday but we need to go
[14:41] up a little early
[14:43] love your enemies
[14:45] bless them that curse you
[14:47] do good to them that hate you and pray
[14:50] for them which despitefully use you and
[14:52] persecute you
[14:53] that you may be the children of your
[14:55] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[14:57] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[15:00] good and sendeth rain on the just and
[15:03] the unjust
[15:04] for if you love them which love you
[15:07] what reward heaven
[15:08] that's easy
[15:11] it's easy to be around somebody alive
[15:14] what reward is that do not even the
[15:17] republicans the same
[15:19] and if you salute your brethren only
[15:22] what do you more than others do not even
[15:25] the republicans so
[15:27] and he summed it all up
[15:29] matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect even
[15:32] as your father in heaven
[15:34] is perfect or complete
[15:37] but let's get back to what sister
[15:39] trinity's talking about because remember
[15:43] there's a point here you do love
[15:45] everybody but remember
[15:47] i've heard i've heard people in this
[15:49] church say well i'm going to go to
[15:50] church with them so they'll come to
[15:52] church with us you can't do that
[15:54] right you cannot compromise by doing
[15:56] that
[15:57] there is no compromising to that
[16:00] you don't do that
[16:02] if they want to come here that's okay
[16:05] but to go there and miss the service
[16:07] here
[16:08] i i don't see so what you're doing is
[16:10] you're compromising with them
[16:13] no
[16:14] stay where you are
[16:16] be an example i promise you if you
[16:18] become the example what is virtue
[16:20] strength if they can't draw virtue off
[16:22] of you
[16:23] they're not coming anyway they're just
[16:25] gonna come because you come
[16:27] and when you see that many times they
[16:28] just you know you
[16:30] you you go visit somebody and say well
[16:32] i'm i'm gonna go visit so-and-so
[16:35] and then they feel like they need to
[16:36] come visit you because you ain't visit
[16:38] them
[16:39] well not in the spiritual world
[16:42] brother branham loved those people and
[16:43] he did go and preach for him because
[16:45] listen brother brown was in a unique
[16:47] situation he was coming out of the old
[16:49] pentecostal age
[16:51] amen
[16:53] he was trying to restore the faith of
[16:55] the father
[16:56] through those people because remember
[16:58] you and i his people were not here yet
[17:02] you understand what i'm saying his
[17:04] people that are going to understand the
[17:06] end time message
[17:07] and know the end time message and take
[17:09] the the whole word
[17:11] we weren't even in we weren't even
[17:13] setting any denominations at that time
[17:14] some of us weren't even born you
[17:16] understand what i'm saying yes 56 57 so
[17:19] most of us in this room well a lot of
[17:21] you were but i wouldn't
[17:23] most of y'all cathy and all them
[17:25] i was born
[17:26] for that
[17:27] but uh
[17:30] we really did miss you
[17:33] right
[17:34] now
[17:37] ray said he didn't take
[17:39] and that's sweet
[17:42] see he didn't have no clothes where you
[17:43] had to buy him something from south
[17:44] dakota so we can wear it
[17:47] where it's closed this is going on the
[17:48] internet you know
[17:50] all right
[17:52] yeah
[17:53] love your enemies
[17:56] we'll bless them that curse you
[17:59] do good to them that hate you this is
[18:01] all contrary to human nature
[18:05] that scripture right there is contrary
[18:08] to your human nature you have got to
[18:10] override everything in your life that
[18:13] you've heard all the hatred all that i
[18:15] do you know don't talk to them people
[18:17] don't do that but remember find a line
[18:20] here
[18:21] by the line we're brotherly kindness
[18:22] brother brown preached to those people
[18:25] but he never entered into their doctrine
[18:29] he went to the assemblies he went to the
[18:30] church of god he went and he said
[18:32] they're fine brothers and they were born
[18:33] again believers in those
[18:36] buildings at that time did everybody
[18:37] understand that say amen
[18:40] they weren't not that we're just born
[18:41] again and they were all off
[18:43] no
[18:44] when a sister would come to the platform
[18:46] in 1949 and he said sister i see that
[18:48] you're
[18:49] a christian you're born again
[18:52] well she was probably a pentecostal
[18:54] 40s pentecostal even maybe a baptist or
[18:57] a methodist
[18:58] but remember as it gets closer watch how
[19:01] that pyramid gets smaller and smaller
[19:04] so we've come to this time where we
[19:05] don't take our group of people
[19:08] and go to a denominational church
[19:10] you can't convert denominational
[19:12] churches
[19:16] you can convert denominational people
[19:18] yes but you cannot
[19:21] say well we're going to go to the
[19:22] baptist and we're just going to
[19:24] close shop and we're going to all go
[19:26] start going to a baptist church
[19:28] that's not you can't do that
[19:30] but brotherly kindness is though that
[19:32] god
[19:33] not looked down on them
[19:35] say well they're nothing
[19:37] well you know they might be something
[19:40] right they might be given eternal life
[19:41] for what they believe
[19:43] for what they see
[19:45] and we may miss it because we see it and
[19:46] don't believe it
[19:48] or live it one of the two
[19:51] all right
[19:53] but we don't go out there with it you
[19:54] say well sister says well i don't feel
[19:56] comfortable about going to your church
[19:57] if you'll if you'll wear earrings with
[19:59] me i'll go to church with you know so i
[20:01] won't feel some no you don't enter into
[20:03] that
[20:04] we still have a lot of holiness that we
[20:06] keep
[20:07] okay
[20:08] and to me that's where the true love
[20:10] comes from you keep your love to god
[20:12] first
[20:14] then you take that love
[20:16] and when you give it to somebody else if
[20:18] you give that love not your love or the
[20:20] love of something else if you give them
[20:22] your love that you have the godly love
[20:23] you have if you give it to them
[20:26] and they accept it they're going to
[20:28] automatically act like you do
[20:32] right you're not going to convert to
[20:35] them
[20:36] and really they're not converting to you
[20:38] up there where it says jesus christ is
[20:40] who we believe in
[20:42] brother brown said right here in this
[20:43] quote right here
[20:47] it's who i believe in jesus christ
[20:50] now we know that under the revelation
[20:52] that we have it's not the same jesus
[20:54] christ that they
[20:58] they're in a trinitarian doctrine
[21:01] okay they're believing that jesus the
[21:02] second person of the trinity
[21:04] but so did you at one time yes
[21:07] so did we have other gods
[21:10] you know to understand the meaning of
[21:12] love the way god means it
[21:15] it's really hard
[21:17] because
[21:18] what did god do with his enemies
[21:20] he destroyed them and abraham lincoln
[21:22] said the best
[21:24] the best way to make
[21:26] uh to get rid of your enemies is to make
[21:28] them your friends
[21:30] abraham lincoln said that
[21:33] right you remember the story
[21:36] the south was defeated and
[21:39] one of the congressmen from the north
[21:40] was standing there beating his hands on
[21:42] the
[21:43] desk in congress and he said
[21:46] they're our enemies they're our enemies
[21:48] they're you know how we gonna you know
[21:49] because abraham lincoln wanted them
[21:52] to show
[21:53] brotherhood that everything was coming
[21:54] back together
[21:55] he said they're our enemies we should
[21:57] treat them like the enemies and
[21:59] abraham lincoln said
[22:01] if we treat them like their enemies
[22:03] they'll continue to be our enemies but
[22:05] if we treat them like our fans our
[22:06] friends we have destroyed
[22:09] the enemy
[22:10] without destroying the physical person
[22:13] right now we read in psalm 78 that was a
[22:16] perfect example
[22:18] now god destroyed the amalekites and all
[22:20] the amorites and all those people
[22:21] because they sinned against god but now
[22:23] so did
[22:24] israel did israel stand against god just
[22:27] like they went after baal they went
[22:29] after i've been reading in judges man in
[22:32] judges they went after everything
[22:34] when there was no king or when you know
[22:36] between the time of between the time of
[22:38] abraham and all them and and david you
[22:40] had a gap in there where it was ruled by
[22:43] judges and man they were putting up
[22:45] groves for baal and all these things
[22:48] god has sent a prophet in like
[22:50] gideon or somebody destroy it
[22:52] guess what it raised right back up to it
[22:54] again but what i'm saying here
[22:57] i forgive them of their iniquity
[23:00] because they're his children
[23:02] they were his children from the
[23:04] beginning
[23:05] same way with you and i were his
[23:06] children from the beginning
[23:08] that's what that's why you see all that
[23:10] summation
[23:15] even after all that
[23:17] he gives you a summation
[23:19] you can be perfect
[23:21] even as your father in heaven is purpose
[23:23] because that's that's a commandment be
[23:25] therefore perfect as your father never
[23:28] but we do not have to and i don't think
[23:30] we ever should
[23:32] compromise on our belief
[23:35] we should never compromise on our belief
[23:37] we should be so salty until they see now
[23:40] see what what the confusion is in this
[23:42] end time
[23:43] is that you go out and i'm going to talk
[23:44] about you don't talk about you and most
[23:46] of message people they go out and act
[23:48] like the devil in secret
[23:50] at work
[23:52] play or whatever
[23:54] say a little bad word wear a little
[23:56] something different than you would at
[23:57] church
[23:58] put your whatever put whatever in there
[24:00] they see that and that confuses them
[24:03] more than it helps them
[24:05] there's your confusion is if they look
[24:07] at you and can't see the christian life
[24:10] but you profess the christian life and
[24:11] come to this church or whatever message
[24:14] church
[24:15] there's the confusion that's what
[24:17] confuses people more than anything
[24:20] is for you to live one way here and
[24:22] another way out there
[24:23] and somebody see that and go well
[24:26] why are you doing that and
[24:28] you're supposed to be doing this you
[24:30] know what why are you out here breaking
[24:32] the law
[24:33] xyz doesn't matter put whatever in there
[24:36] and then you come here and profess
[24:37] you're a christian
[24:39] to me
[24:41] to me that is
[24:43] well
[24:44] really probably not born again
[24:47] probably not even at the bottom of the
[24:48] pyramid
[24:49] okay because
[24:51] because you're supposed to act this way
[24:52] all the time
[24:53] and you know what there's times that we
[24:54] slip up and do make mistakes we do
[24:56] maybe break the law or or something but
[24:59] but it's not out of
[25:01] it's not out of every time we go to the
[25:03] store we
[25:04] try to cheat somebody out of something
[25:05] or you know
[25:07] i've heard people even in the message
[25:10] we go eat somewhere and
[25:12] they wouldn't put a tip down
[25:15] because that person wasn't a christian
[25:16] or that person would have tattoos or
[25:19] earrings or whatever
[25:21] of course me and jim we always
[25:24] slip a little extra money on the plate
[25:26] or on the table before we leave i've
[25:28] seen 20 people in a message church get
[25:30] up
[25:31] leave a table and leave two dollars for
[25:33] a tip
[25:35] happened in miami i'm sorry it happened
[25:37] in miami with us and that girl worked
[25:40] her fanny off for about 20 of us and
[25:43] they left two dollars
[25:45] now you'll be ashamed of yourself to me
[25:47] that's not and you know what you said
[25:48] while the girl well you know what that
[25:49] girl saw with you sitting there
[25:52] she saw you were talking about the lord
[25:53] i hope
[25:54] and you had your lung you had the long
[25:56] hair the dress and you're supposed to be
[25:57] a church group
[25:59] and then you get up and do that you know
[26:01] what puts a sour taste in her mouth she
[26:03] said whatever they got i don't want
[26:05] that's right
[26:06] okay so and that's just one thing leave
[26:08] a tip you know if you leave 15 that's
[26:11] fine but we always believe 20. but you
[26:13] know what they're hard-working people
[26:17] that's brotherly kindness that's showing
[26:18] no barriers i don't care if the woman's
[26:20] got tattoos
[26:22] tongue ring or if her ears are pierced
[26:25] 50 times to me that makes no difference
[26:27] that's right
[26:30] now we do judge by looks don't we
[26:33] we do as human judged by looks
[26:36] we shouldn't do that that's what jesus
[26:38] said
[26:40] love your enemies
[26:42] bless them that curse you do good to
[26:44] them that hate you
[26:47] i'll leave you with that
[26:49] we'll follow up next sunday
[26:56] i told you this is going to be the
[26:57] toughest one
[27:47] for it they only paid 20 10 30
[27:49] or vice versa
[27:52] no no the fact that they did give
[27:55] say they sold a piece of property for a
[27:57] thousand dollars they said oh we get 500
[28:00] for this and here's our five hundred
[28:01] dollars well they kept 500.
[28:03] that was the problem they kept 500.
[28:06] and the lord just earned that
[28:09] yeah and said no you didn't give all
[28:12] you only
