========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] ah oh oh oh you foreign [Applause] more so [Applause] and just turn to each other greet each other in the name of the lord shake each other's hands let's say that song once more we're going to ask your brother oh so hey all the ones that are here we've got a few requests here other colleagues since johnny's also having you know she's been through some problems the young guy lost his life last night at the racetrack locally raised the track god knows who they are wherever they may be [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] is [Applause] yes uh believe it's already oh [Applause] and we're we started out uh really i heard of the 1966 introduced into the message [Music] it just didn't work out because there was no work [Music] [Music] service that was our first official service our indian church and then our good afternoon building beyond a man's camp but that's all back there that people would just can't die and they'd say to you how to use their own love to remember what truth were you of who you thought [Music] to do ever since then it's all working real good have been for 50 years and i thoroughly enjoyed it with all the heartaches and troubles that you could uh talk about it's just the point of being and he stayed headed to 1975 and i took over 75 against the pastor and moved on into the lord but the first service we had and i sure do hope it doesn't really first service we had we didn't have any parking in the back we had to park out in the front little store building [Music] no well then we finally let's just say one more verse you know one more before we leave well just as we started to sing here it came fighting right we have it on time [Applause] and he was filled up on prescription drugs and all that and the man that was chasing me down the street and he told us about it they were trying to stop him he was running like 85 miles an hour going in and out of the road he hit the first vehicle dead knocked it into the next vehicle there was five vehicles saying god he never wanted to total loss from the old car online but that afternoon that was the beginning continued on from god going and have had a good time that's all i want to tell you it has nothing to do a lot of people say oh but most of you know about it legally amen but we made it through all those years and laid it on this establishment and as i took over then my goal was one time to try my best to instill into the people the message the problem [Applause] [Applause] you just love the word if he said brother brown believed in one god [Music] [Music] is and the lives of people have tried to [Music] this virus has been through the land it never changed one thing in the i don't mean that good i made it back i mean it to the point that what it done you if you look like this but you're not going to settle down and say this message here you would blaze and didn't get to church before the virus struck you just lazy and god walmart has become for the word of god i thought christians were expected to have problems [Music] the greatest time we've had in 1969 i tried my best to explain what your prophecy was saying that the pride of jesus christ would be the son of man in the last days that she be the fullness of the godhead right that's what your brother said i think it's the 50th anniversary but to me it's the 50th year of understanding and trying my best to proclaim the truth amen and get people to see it amen because that's what we're supposed to do i'm supposed to settle down in him and rest in him and let the word of god be and like i said how many of you have resonated you know the colors of the book well you're just an intellectual brother well if the intellect can brought preacher holy ghost then you need intellect but we know it can't right because it is the truth the holy ghost is guarding air and it's failed now in you if there's anything to celebrate today is one time 50 years of trying to preach one message i don't know i preached many many years ago mankind thought will be the end of the world [Music] those days now everything is running out yes so what are you going to do when it comes to the next one or you'll get you another one you'll find you another excuse for a day or a time see that's not christianity christianity is resting in jesus christ and allowing him to cut over in our lives and let him be the leader right we're not supposed to leave him he's supposed to lead us into [Music] well he's got his point right across all right so we're supposed to be ending up on time and then a celebration you know so for the old people because he has been brother points been anchored in this message i said you'll be preaching to them [Applause] didn't want somebody being young because they didn't understand i'm honest honestly saying that if you don't you young ones your young ministers sit down and listen listen to them explain and talk about the god when a man stops talking about the thought of his life and start talking about what he is in life that he's failed already see hello all right so you respect and honor it and listen to what is said well that's all we ask of anything so let's just go on into the service now and turn it back over to the job where you know the same wireless turn that over [Music] to say i've never tried to gain much ground in life because it's not much school we could have had a big monstrosity reveal and greater than this we could have had all kind of things we had the money but instead of doing that i chose to send it to the farm field to the mystery and let them have an opportunity you go over there you look at what they're living in [Music] always wondered how we could get the next guy well then they kept on coming with me and the brothers of the church said brother dale let's go on the internet i said no no no no no no you know i said because as quickly as i get on the internet the first phone call is going to be more out of me answering it because people are going to be calling me brother you're wrong you're wrong know me know one thing for sure i've been playing around but put your name on my value sent it to the world i've always said that i've always said let the messages go out who the name is i wanted the message to go forward that we've achieved that goal because we're in 168 countries but they don't then keep up with all those things and all that we're in a big portion of the world is receiving the message from the little town of louisville georgia and that's what we want to do just finish the whole thing up one time and say it god is our god worship have a good time whatever they desire to do and they will go right on eating together it would work hard work all the internet and we sent it to the world if i could finish anything in my day life to give this message to the people of the world [Music] we walk in this world hours you realize what we buy you realize that martin luther you probably got a hundred dozen books that he wrote john wesley was more the world has an opportunity but then i believe [Music] amen do you pray get started [Applause] [Music] is [Music] yourself this morning whatever need you have this morning bring it before the lord in faith approach him in faith in his word it's already god amen we have a long list of specials this morning but what we're going to do is kind of break them up into two parts we will uh try to get to as many specials as we can this morning and then after the service they'll be preparing the food and we'll call it special so okay heavenly father thank you thank you father let's all stand for a moment [Applause] yes is ah is oh is is i see me me yes i'm is [Music] oh [Music] is hey is [Applause] yes uh uh is just want to give a real quick testimony [Music] just really had a wonderful time but for me you know it was it was a life-changing experience but i just thank the lord that he gave me two wonderful veterans of the field to shepherd me along the way because you know i'm always all soft-hearted well i don't know if i'd ever go out of chemistry brother saying it hadn't been for him and brother ernie helping me keep from giving everything i had away and becoming home thousands of dollars of debt because like he said you go over there and they got nothing i mean they just ain't got nothing you know some of them some of them have good jobs some of you live in nice houses but the majority of them have nothing but i'll tell you what they treated us like we were kings and it ripped my heart out so lord's never opened the door for me to go back to the philippines but i've been in haiti four times another country that's in the same kind of condition i just want to say thank you [Music] have the further we go down the road the more you don't realize the more precious one another really is we're precious and for me how so this morning as we've seen this song you know it's sort of like a life testimony when everything in life seems to have gone the wrong way what do you do satan's coming on strong we [Music] is and start praising the lord [Applause] is [Music] i've got some places [Applause] what am i

because you couldn't all go free there were certain things that had to stay in the land if you went to work for someone you weren't restored completely but on that 50th year after seven sabbath devil defeated there was a time to go free on the day of pentecost 120 people went free and all down to the church ages people been set free now we're at the end time yeah we're in our 50th we're not in church ages anymore we're outside amen we're in a new day one day made a difference yes the day of jubilee i was thinking this started to come over here and turned everything on and y'all could hear the prophet telling us he said all that they knew that day was coming he said they climbed the ice tree they come and eyes again right up the statue of a perfect man [Music] god bless each and every

put this thing together let's give him a good name and all the ministers for helping and like i said before i'll tell mr kenny mccoy when i see him about this beautiful facility that he gave us to you we thank you all for coming if you're a visitor we thank you for coming some of you have been going to church before spending a lot of visitors so we've had many times here in the past we're standing behind the fulfill right now that was made by one of our first homies he happens to have about three kids here today of george county brother jonathan well let's start with the oldest first because great man goes on his dad is my first one of our first official song leader and then he's got sister esther sitting here so a third of his family sitting here today we love all the ones who came to the church and all the preachers and the deacons and the different ones we've helped over 50 years now where's joey stand up here that's okay that sister's that she's going to play and everything we've got a new group of people coming up and we thank god for the older ones but there are new ones coming up and god carries we got a new group of people and that's a real church when you've got a group of people that you can be consistent with that you can bring generation by generation but listen god will never do something halfway charles charlotte's here that's part of the family of brother earnest boat he started the church for brotherdale and then obviously you've got brotherdale myself my brother terence and my sister hannah it's wonderful to have brothers and sisters in the lord and wonderful to be real family but you are now the real family okay amen this is the real family we just come into a family english this is just a family that's what i tell preachers all the time when they're all kind of nervous when they get up in front of people why be nervous are you nervous did you walk in why like i said like the only person i won't feel uncomfortable today is the devil i want him to feel so uncomfortable he leaves the building [Applause] and a church family there and south carolina beach island it's not anywhere next to an island it's not anywhere next to the beach so it's a big job of south carolina [Music] my heart [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] me i am is [Music] oh [Music] good to see you everybody first time i ever met brother samuel but maybe you've heard somebody testified about what the world looked like after 1973 that was after world war ii and way after the civil war but we've got to save me and my wife and so then um and they were preaching i guess it was brother um [Music] the and after that we went up to visit little samuel and we got the uh and you can always tell the visitors when the training experience came because basically his eyes would get about this big and he thought maybe the train was coming through the door those were the good old days and i think that was probably where the most was the first person that they ever asked me to speak in public i don't know whether [Music] and back in those days i was just in my opening prayer i mentioned jesus and cried for about 10 or 15 minutes and that's what people liked the most about with my crime [Music] and so johnny asked his mom says mom can i go outside and play and you aren't you suggest but don't go across the street don't go to peter's house whatever you do you don't go across the street unless mama's out there okay no [Music] justification is not to justify [Music] in your life and i remember the brother gene collins funeral act i remember the book i have read about world war ii it was written by a man and his uh memories completed at war and he called it still are but we were so young when we [Music] i was being challenged by the sound i run my hearing aids up running down running crosstalk a little bit challenged and then the lighting i was looking at at brother jewel and i was looking right at that light of course i couldn't see anything unless it had gotten away with the light and then when brother jewel came up i noticed his step whole it's funny how you look at that is when you get about 78 and 79. down but i'm glad to be here and i i consider it a privilege and an honor to be here basically at this 50th anniversary and so i i thought well what would be appropriate 50 you think a jubilee and i thought brother samuel by the and i thought well do you believe trump had always sounded on the day of atonement maybe we'd preach dale tournament and i thought well that wouldn't seem to be too appropriate and then there's always the independence day you know easter passover you know 50th anniversary and this may be a little out of place but my mind kept going to command and that might not seem appropriate but in some ways it is because it's christ and his church so i thought about a message i had preached a while back and actually the message came about by a message that brother julie preached at our church so i thought well that would be not appropriate because it actually brother jewel inspired me to preach a little series that was a few years back maybe 10 years eight years and if you're little that way back you know a long time ago and so anyway he'd come and preach the message for us on the end to brother jewel but but the holy spirit had given it for the jewel so then it became my property through inheritance anything that i preached that's revealed to you is yours because god gave it to him and man he can't give me a revelation i can give you knowledge i can't give you revelation so maybe we'd stand together and we'll take a scripture we will maybe we can turn to the book of isaiah [Music] 55. this old house and uh it wasn't it was a few years down the line i didn't realize what the song was about that's like i remember hearing uh ankle bone joined through the knee bone and i thought that was some kind of a death scripture so i thought last night after everything and studied instead but i better learn the words to that song because the shutters ain't working just exactly right you know the door stays open too long oh i just want to tell you that that brother samuel and i have a license to preach long time friendship my wife used to warn me years ago she said now don't go up there and try to say everything you know in one night so in isaiah 55 verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither of your ways my ways save the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways tighter than your ways in my thoughts than your thoughts and then i'd like to read another verse of scripture here in malachi beginning in chapter one the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved him maybe just these years to fulfill your desires to feed your sheep lord may you help us this morning our our hearts our lips our ears lord that you might furnish to your children to your lambs into your sheep this morning that's what they have needed to face the challenges of the day and the hour that we're living in may they leave here this morning with joy in their hearts and a greater faith they have when they came in we ask in jesus christ's name amen now the reason why i chose this oval in scripture or it doesn't seem like it has a whole lot to do with this is that the way that god thinks and the way that god does things we don't always understand as much as we know about the word sometimes we as individuals may not understand all the ways of god and never will but one thing that i find that brother grant said that unless you know god's nature unless you know his ways you'll never understand his word and to know the word is not eternal life but it is to know the author of the word then we have a foundation where we can now understand his words so then i thought intimacy intimacy and the word intimacy of course means something that's private personal you think of an intimate friend an intimate relationship and and the way that we engage intimacy a lot of times is through our physical observances of one another uh i just take for an example hold hands that holding hands can be very intimate now brother wade was holding my hand when i came up because he didn't want me to go down early so that other way was kind of a caring hole so he but it wasn't what we would call real intimate yes where's the lord and so holding the hands uh i i think about my my grandson uh you know when when we get out of the farm little cody you know how children are when they're about three and four they're really kind of active you know and when you get out of the truck they're in the walmart you want to investigate everything really quick and run across and run this way and that's it now when we can't [Music] and i remember one time we got out of the truck and i was getting out and i just pulled in the door and he walked over and he put his hand in one thing and that was a little bit more intimate now i wasn't in a jerk i was we talk about a young man a young woman and so in life you know one of the things that we cherish the most is designed to make to spend life with so when we can share life share experiences and so in maybe trying to find someone that would fill that we have what we call courtship now back in the day when i was out the world called it david [Music] you know have a good time it was always a good time if a man had a girl a girl had a man and all that was but courtship's a little different you're not looking for just uh temporary employment you're looking for something down down the line so in courtship when my daughters were coming to that stage of life daddy becomes very protective with the girls everybody is suspecting to be a wolf and mama you know there's no woman that's good enough for a son so there's a lot of challenges and so in courtship there's a certain intimacy that enters into that relationship because now you're on a talking basis but no holding hands and anytime you all know anywhere junior or sissy's got to be with you don't stick don't sit too close in the truck or at least you have the permission to talk to him on the phone more write a letter and receive a letter so that's a certain intimacy because it's just changed from seeing somebody in the halls or on the street now there's an association and if that association continues then there comes the engagement and that becomes a more intimacy in the beginning it's more formal the man is trying to to show forth his masculinity and his attraction a lot of times what we see in the movies are on the middle boards of what they say the woman desires of a man so then you're trying to you know heritage crack like brother brown said i think it was if somebody was talking about little junior and his hair's all messed up and one day mom looks in there and junior's comb in his hair what the world's going on and so we always try to put the best foot forward we always try the best impression because this is the attraction time and so a lot of times what we go for will be what we call superficial things outward view outward attraction outward conversation but then when we move into the engagement there's a more a relaxing and then there's more intimacy and so there's a little bit more liberty and you know the first time you hold her hand or she holds your hand there's something very intimate you know there's indeed that's what we're talking about and as a relationship goes on you find that the conversation is more intimate so when we think of intimacy we think of those things we think of intimate friends what is an intimate friend it's somebody that becomes your counterbalance because intimacy also involves trust and so there may be a person that you have confidence in and you share your fears of life you share your secret struggles and sometimes we're disappointed in life because maybe it's shared with people that it shouldn't have been shared with so intimacy also speaks to communications the more intimate you with somebody the more confident you have and the more that you share with somebody now you take a husband and a wife that would be the ultimate intimacy because now there's that union that takes place but you know strangers that might sing that brother samuel is a real close friend of mine i would share things with him that i would not share with my wife right not because i'm trying to keep a secret trainer but because there's those things that men share one another and in the same way but the ultimate intimacy we would say would be a marriage between a man so intimacy with god how do we measure intimacy with god now we find a lot of times when we did i guess we still do that at the altar calls we find that one expression i want to close the wall what does that express me i want something i want a more intimate relationship and we watch people in church and praise and worship and you know you say well i just love god so much well how will you express your love for him he's a spirit we can't grab hold of him and so then i i thought about this i thought intimacy god's intimacy and god you know he doesn't think like we think right we find in these two scriptures that in the in the first scripture he lets us know that the way that he judges things the way that he looks at things is not the way that we judge things even if we're religious so you must be born now what happens when you're born again then that soul that is in you is quicker and it's not so much a little person in christ comes and gets inside of you but the life that was in christ is now resident within you and that's what we call the mind of christ because that just sets us in order now that we can grow into the kingdom of god and wisdom knowledge and understanding we can't receive the things from god unless we have the spirit of god and that's not the spirit of god honest it's in us and then now we can receive those things that god freely gives to each and every one of us so that begins a relationship with him intimacy intimacy god's intimacy so let's turn if we will i'd like to go to genesis chapter 5 and this is where i draw from from what brother jewels preaching and from my studies uh i've taken a series on enig as the bride of christ and i hesitate to say that he was a type of the bride of christ the living that is to be translated is not a type of the bride that's going to sleep that will come up resurrection and it may be wrong i say that enoch was the first fruit of the translating bride because his life was so such a parallel noah was a type of 144 000 and he was the type of the sleeping virgin because his life was a little bit different he was carried across the judgment but when enoch is different he was translated and that's different than elijah because elijah was translated but it didn't say that he wouldn't see death right over there in the middle east because it said that he was translated that he wouldn't see that so they we are translating that remain and he wasn't just the type he was translated that he wouldn't see that so let's read about in just a minute in genesis 5 and verse 21. enoch lived five years and he had methuselah and he walked with god after he didn't get assumed 300 years and be dead sons and daughters and all the days of enoch were 365 years and he walked with god and he was not god took him so this is interesting because anything is 65 years old before he walked with god now he has a child and we find him walking with god what what caused this because this certainly is a change in relationship because he's not an unbeliever it's not that he's getting born again because he's up to the leading coming down from the set and the man began to call on the name of the lord as far as we know offering sacrifice according to revelation so he was going to church but now something that happens into his life that elevates him into a intimate or more intimate relationship with god 65 years old and he's a believer but now something happens into his life right and now he's in a more intimate relationship because he's walking with god and listen it's not because he's invited god to walk so god was expressing an [Applause] and i'm talking about you 65 years old now he's walking with god in the old testament there's only two people that walk with god interesting enough it was any canola they were kings that walked after god abraham uh was told to walk before god daniel was beloved of god but it never said he walked with god so this is interesting at the end time any walk with god what caused this change in intimacy and how can i measure intimacy so let's if we will let's go to jesus in hebrews 11 i'm sorry and verse 5 now remember each of these subjects in hebrews 11. it's not talking about a common relationship but when it says able by faith often have a more excellent sacrifice we're talking about abel's experience and the things that he was doing and so when i'm talking about enid this scripture is going to be revealing of enid and what he was doing amen it's not talking about able it's not talking about abraham they may have some things in common but this this is a testimony this is a record this is a biology you can put it that way so it says by faith was translated so the first thing we find out that his translation was as a result of his faith so what i don't tell me about it tells you a whole lot hebrews 11 and 1 tells us that faith is the substance of things hoped for anything that i learn in the scriptures is true from genesis to revelation so any time i find faith it must first come to you as whole because faith is the substance of things hoped for and hope the prophet says i believe it's in the adoption series he says hope is an intellectual faith hope is something that you've read something that you've seen something that you've heard something that you believe and i find there's two types of poll hope begins in the intellectual realm in the spoke words original see he calls that the womb yeah and so would you say intellectual hope never perceives on the faith but it dies in the mind but there's a hole that is of god that goes on to be faith and faith is the substance of things before so before enoch had his faith he had a hope okay right but then hope becomes right during this program people committing suicide why well they got to confine the house of course i've got a little cabinet people yeah because they can't go out and go shopping they can't go to parties whatever life is about them because now they're sometimes within the perimeters of their home brought salvation to us so it's a matter of you accepting what god has given to his son christ so we're not hoping to get saved like catholics and different drugs they're hoping when they get to the [Music] of his glorious appearing that blessed hope that is set before us the second coming of christ now in romans 4 when we're reading about abraham it said to abraham so in other words there's two holes one hope is based on things that he's seen that he heard maybe his hope is built on science because up to a certain point in life he believed god because god said him and sarah were going to have a child and up until that time that he would still have children but now he had come to a time that nature had declared that he was past that time when sarah was past that time all right so then his whole like jacob uh that hope that he had through science was no more right but the hope that he had that he believed god that hope was greater than the hope that man has in his natural being and then it goes on to say not being weak and safe now that's interesting because here he has hope and this hope is based on god's word and he believes that he's going to have that child but somewhere hope turns to faith because now faith says it disregards it doesn't even acknowledge the condition of his body and sarah's body because faith [Music] [Music] but that hope must become faith brother said hope is faith worst enemy when we were a child we talked as children we played with things that was challenged but then when we became a man so hope has its life because you can't have faith without hope but there has become a time that when hope becomes faith in genesis 18 brother brown calls it the sun man experience the son of man repeating himself now it's interesting because in genesis 18 1 that when abraham sees these strangers he recognizes the lord right away this is the son of man revealing himself all right amen and immediately after this experience their bodies were changed to this experience becomes faith so hope is one thing but then love gives us experience and it's interesting if you read hebrews 11 11 because it said through faith pharaoh also now up until that time it was by faith by faith by faith but when it comes to sir it says through faith but sarah also receives strength and that word strength is dues it's a supernatural power it's [Music] why because she believed that he that made the promise was able to fulfill that so now abraham has moved from hope to faith but sarah is still in hope he's saying why do you say that because when god was instructed her and she was behind in the tent yeah he says you and sarah are going to have this child i'm going to visit you according to the time of life and she within herself behind the tent and he said why did sarah laugh and say within can you imagine in determining and looking at her eye and said yes she did now something happens because she was laughing that's whole she might have believed but she didn't have to say but now she realizes that this man is not just a man but it's god in human flesh because and if you notice from that time sarah had faith and her body also was changed [Music] the son of man experience represents translating faith to bring us to a translation because it was genesis 21 before god visited her and by divine intervention when we need to stop by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and it was not failed that tells me somebody was looking for it because you cannot be not found unless somebody was looking for you now i'm not talking about anything i'm talking about you his wife was looking for him the mayor was looking for him [Music] for his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god and i heard somebody preach one time that he was going around telling everybody he pleased god and what you need to do is go around telling everybody you please god but i believe your testimony is your life the greatest is the life they live and if you don't have a live black and you're preaching this void empty it's tinkling symbols and veils it's just times in the wind amen so he had a testimony that he pleased god and without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them in the diligently seeking so that tells me now he was seeking the presence of god and i thought he was the only one that had translated faith out of all the generations of the first one right they weren't evil it was the children yeah that began to mean but the first foreign lineage that came down it was but jesus said and let your righteousness exceed the righteousness so then your faith must exceed the faith because they had faith they had faith for a resurrection and a translation but they did not have faith for a translation it wasn't needed at that time amen that's right so it says the lord descended with a shout with a message and that message was for what it was to provide rapturing because romans 10 tells me it's impossible to have faith without first the word of the god of the word of god now faith is not hearing the word of god right because everybody that hears this morning may not walk out with more faith right you may not receive anything but faith cometh by the hearing of the word so that tells me that abel that he would know that abraham god had to provide word before they could have faith and it had to be hulk before it became faith there was an experience so then he had a testimony his life pleased god and without faith it's impossible to please him and he was seeking him i thought what caused what caused him to begin to seek god why didn't he say that he didn't call the name of god until the end that's interesting and so then they began to call on the name of god in other words they were going to church they were offered up to sacrifice and they were living by all the words that they had because remember adam was never called a prophet abel was the first one listed as the so prophet prophet has the word of the lord so if i go to jews jew tells me that he didn't prophesy amen so evie was a prophet after john ate the book what's the central attraction of revelation 10 the angel no the seventh agent no it's the book that's what the focus is is the book the angel came down with the book and it was given to john to eat because it was his inheritance in that book so now we find that you as the bride of christ the living bride also has a prophetic message now the secret things belong to the lord but those things that are revealed to us now belong to us into our children amen jesus we find that abraham was called a friend of god i think it's in truly old testament i think it was chronicles and another book in the old testament he's called a friend isaiah and then in jace james calls him to god and in genesis god was speaking to abraham he said should i hide anything that i shall do from abraham doesn't call him friend but jesus said i don't call you servant i call you friend now a servant has a certain intimacy or relationship with the master that the people on the street know sometimes people might approach brother brother i always think brother dale i always said that the first name first name you know dale samuel no that ain't right it's samuel dale but it seems like the first thing you all have two first names somehow so if they want to talk to daddy who are they going to go to they either going to go to wife or something and it's not because they're interested in the sun they're interested in that right influence pulpit whatever it might be so we finally said i don't call you servant i call you friend so now there's an elevation from servant friend because sin we know is a more intimate relationship so now god is giving us an insight as to what intimacy involves he says i call you friend because everything that the father told me i told you now we find that intimacy on god's heart is measured by revelation amen yes revelation of prophecy this is to be an intimate age right eating had an intimate more intimate relationship than any other person in that age other than possibly norm and this is the bright age it's the same one that they call the church down through the ages because it's one body one church but when she was in the infant stage then she was in the young woman age now she's in the miracle so this is the most intimate age between god and the church in this last age always represents prophets and prophets represent prophecy so this is an age of not the making of prophecy but the fulfilling time god is elected he's elected not only in his love jacob of my love but because the seed that uncreated soul that was part and jacob was thirsting for god so that part of god became the birthright but he was not satisfied with the birthright it is when he met the angel amen that his life was changed from jacob to israel the woman at the well was seeking eating was seeking you were seeking all right he was seeking god the woman if you will was seeking god [Music] your spirit tried to interpret the language of the soul all right [Applause] then your soul was thirsting for god and the spirit said you need to go to a party the spirit said they could understand it it could hear the noise but it couldn't understand what the soul was saying but it knew that it wanted something and you need a center of it so the woman at the well was seeking god she was seeking that stability she was seeking that comfort cheater right [Music] religions but now she's in the presence of the word himself and he is standing there he's positioned himself in such a way that it creates a conversation because now he is wanting to reveal himself to her so you were seeking but it wasn't so much that you found him but it wasn't he positioned himself in front of you for a conversation in just a few minutes under that ministry she went from segregation i'm i'm a samaritan you're a jew if i give you this drink something right not jesus but the spirit god was dealing with her and she went from one end of the spectrum comes the church hey what's going on we're gonna have a good time because i remember he was you he was seeking god and he was seeking him diligently because the scripture tells me he was what caused him to do that i remember years ago 30 years ago 20 years ago we had a sister in our church she was an older lady and like me now not then she liked to talk and she had been in her rounds and meetings and she would tell this one particular meeting she was in and there was wheelchairs all up and down for this one and then you go over and pray for this one about time he got over there by time he got to the end of the world everybody that was in the eye all this stupid then the next time we have coffee and little church gathered she started following it again and then she said again become he tells you about oh i can remember back now we have evidence that that that adam had testified when he talks about the ministry of his son noah he talks about the land being cursed right and how the noble's going to bring peace rest to the people now how did he know the lamb was cursed when god cursed the land in the garden of eden not outside so then that information had to be brought out by abel so he must have been testifying also that cain and abel listen to the testimony of their father what taking place in the garden of eden and from that testimony god inspired abraham i mean that abel offered up the sacrifice so one day he thinks you know there must be more than just going to church and singing songs so he's sitting in the coffee shop one morning with all the other brothers in there he starts at all today you know that's the scripture that eve felt right but she didn't believe that he was the same yesterday right today is seeking the presence of god then if he's going to reward him what's he going to do with let him meet the church his wife he's going and an atheist is self-made there's nobody that's born in atheism there's nobody born and agnostic there's nobody born a christian we're born infidels we're born an idolater i believe in good luck bad luck oh this was my this was my lucky knife i had those when i killed at that 14 point buck perhaps when i go hunting this year i'll have my lucky knife with me and i'll shoot another one what have i done i am attributing supernatural power to this piece of metal good luck bad luck is idolatry yeah we are holding a supernatural force with that item or with that tradition or ritual yeah somewhere and when you're driving down the road and that black cat runs was now searching and seeking for the presence of god something more than church what was it that the son of man experienced projected more than trained for the sick raising them right it was something peculiar to guard it wasn't just one of the gifts of the spirit this was a personal identification of god alone amen that was projected through a man the son of himself through flesh in the days of jesus christ it was sinless flesh god and man this generation he was born through a man revealing to you the presence of the living god vindicated that what this man had to say god approved us because he was received a visitation from god because he's a reward and when he came to him he had seen the complacency of the church he had seen the children now beginning to intermingle with cain's children right like we're preaching on that for a while but we're moving he saw the deterioration of the church the laxity of the church now the intermingling of the church and remember it was finally broke the camel's back when god said live a little longer 120 years yet that was after that they begin to god and god said that's it amen being a prophet because if he prophesied that means he had the word of the lord was a prophet he said you can speak against me but you're speaking against the word of the lord i become the word of the lord and because you speak against the word now listen he received the word when he was out there just a minor armor he didn't even own any man he was just a sycamore just like a minor charm then his daddy wasn't a problem then no king nothing but god elected to reveal to him the word and what came to eat it and healing was a prophet he prophesied so then god must have revealed prophetic truth and he said enoch what you're seeing is the truth it's absolutely my mind the condition of the church the condition of the condition of the world you're going to have a son and you're going to name that son because the word methuselah means that when he dies the delusion comes the flood will come the judgment any bill procurement he may not understand it but but thy divine revelation that he built it and it was never capped off that was the second bible so enoch wrote the second bible by inspiration not even understanding right about it he didn't have to understand it he just did what god told him he had a testimony he had a ministry he prophesied all the way to the second coming of christ so edie's ministry reaches all the way to the bride that's living as the second coming of christ she will be preaching the same message he preached same spirit yes and he had a sign yes and from that time when he had that baby and he named that baby it she has to know the mark of the beast yes or how can she use this and everybody has yeah she has to recognize she's in the tribulation how will she know that people have been saying we're in the tribulation period we've got people among us that's in the millennium walking around the bride has that message i'm not talking about knowledge prophecy believe create hope and hope as expectations if you're hoping to buy a new car and he said well if i say fifty dollars a month i can buy this apartment x amount of time so your hope and your expectation changes your financial reactions in your life so prophetical word influences and brings full hope brings expectation expectation begins to mold our character i was talking to a young minister several years ago and he had started a church in a house and the people in the church were mostly pentecostal right off the street and they've been pastors for a couple years two years three years still in the home still had about the same amount of people and they were still dominated by other pentecostal thoughts traditions and ways and so i was talking to him where he had the services now they understand the seventh seal you understand the son of man so i could see this by talking to him and so i said you know success is not in the size of the church it's not in the building it's not how deep the church churches so how is success measurement and i told you success is measured in the heart as far as i can i can't bring him and he got frustrated with him and he's been going out preaching a little bit oh he got all of them oh great message you got back home listen if you can preach it for home church you can preach anyway everything you'd reach here whole 50 years you can think about the number of your sermons right number 10 oh that was a good one number 25 whoa that one was deep you know that's the way the so success is not measured in the outward things but that brother samuel been a successful pastor measured in the heart it's mentioned in your heart this man had gotten tired and you're going to go to another church somebody he could leave so does it does it leave brother dale with bitterness do you see business i've tried to teach this church and there's do when a man decides to be a farmer maybe he's got an office job so he goes out there and he said i'm going to be a farmer he starts working on the farm how do starts to things weight his muscles begin to tone up now he ain't pumping iron and going down to the goal of the journey he's out here working he's laboring and in that laboring his his body's changing he's in the sun he's getting the sun he's going down to the beauty salon turning on the lights something's changing when he's laboring something changes in his heart and even if either becomes embittered or it begins to grow in sympathy when you leave the compassion look how they treated me you know that's not success hi martin wasn't successful after those first 40 years success is of your people pray that you have said something worth you can take universe to an individual one little drop of water you can open up a flooding river oh god you can do much with little and man seemingly doesn't live with much so may you take these words multitude of words and may it be may it be a live stream maybe a water of early land a lateral early ladder together made your people leave here with the happiness of fellowship yes of light kindred faith and brothers and sisters that have been sanctified by truth separated from the world through faith and may there be some that was brought last night and today and through the song may you minister to your people yes lord we need you more than without you we can do nothing and anything that we can do without you and you bless each individual in jesus christ hey oh thank you let's stand and together ready for the food and things and singing and worshiping that time
