your eyes upon jesus look [Music] and the things of this earth will grow strangely [Music] [Laughter] [Music] you love me this morning eyes upon jesus [Music] [Music] in [Music] amen you come to see the lord today turn your eyes upon jesus you know i was thinking back when there was nothing but a holy of holies that the people would send that priest in and when that um curtain would shut he couldn't see nothing couldn't hear nothing and all of a sudden the light comes on the shekinah glory would meet him in that room he couldn't hear all the hustle and bustle two million people working doing their job the animals blading and all that going on cars going by trains going by let's bring it to the 2022. he didn't hear any of that today i believe you i know you're the i know you're that temple but you come into a place that we ought to just shut the world out um as we were brother joe and i were talking last night for those of you that came to the prayer service thank you very much but it's just the time that you know number one and we'll talk about this afternoon and listen i know some of you scatter out of here for second service but i'd like for you to come back to second service if you can because we're going to talk on a measure of faith and i believe it'll help everybody for a measure of faith not just we we've got to have faith for the time brother dale preached it years and years ago that the woman at the well had faith for the time but the prayer service number one we made an effort to get here you say well i can pray at home and that's okay sister regina and sister kathy that's okay if y'all want to get take that seven to eight time and you don't have to come up here but you know what this is a sanctuary what does a sanctuary mean it's a place of safety when you have an animal sanctuary you put the animals in it and nobody gets to hunt them it's a sanctuary well that's what we do when we come here this is a sanctuary of god and i'll read this quote to you because brother brown said look in law in grace 1954 he said how we ought to come to church with the greatest of reverence how we ought to enter the church like real saints of god rocco walk over take your position i didn't say take your seat take your position and keep your mind on christ we ought to forsake everything of the world like that and if you're really born again this may cut just a little bit but you know this is the house of correction and reading them from the prophet if you're really born of the spirit of god that's where your heart lays anyway your thoughts is anchored yonder jesus said he that hears my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life he that heareth my words and believeth we believe that as we were talking about last night brother joe and i that you come into this place and your cell phones are off kids are not screaming um you're in a sanctuary and god met us last night in this sanctuary because it was quiet it was a quiet place and we just had some soft music playing and if you want to enter in at home that's fine that is absolutely okay if you can't get here but this church was dedicated and set aside a long time ago for the service of god not for the service of the devil all right that's why we try our best i know he gets here before we do but we try our best to make him so uncomfortable that he leaves amen but thank you for coming to the prayer service we'll have another one in the middle of july before we go to um ohio we will have another prayer service here at the church on saturday sometime i'll announce it later all right remember wednesday night i'll be speaking wednesday night so be in prayer for that um brother tom ernest wife sister sandy member brother tom passed away year ago with covid she's going to come by and visit with us for the middle of the week so just make her welcome her and her family will be passing through here and they're going to be here in service with us on

healed that stitch he sent a healing angel and he healed those stitches i've said many times before god's so gracious he heals all them people upon those hospitals that don't care one thing about him but he sent a healing power into the world and you just got to receive it faith cometh by hearing hear by the word of god so let's bow our heads thank you all for for coming and thank you for

of years lord so i pray that you should be with them take care of each one lord bless us in jesus name amen all right let's see if we can get this up on the screen if not we're going to read john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory of the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth can anybody see that or i need to make that bigger could everybody say it i can make it bigger sister julie said nope i can't see it all right hang on now you just made me where i got to do something here no no i'm worried about it just hang on man we'll get it look watch this right here watch it how about that is that better okay thank god for technology but more that i can understand it all right we gotta hide all that they said we got to auto hide this so we're going to auto hide ribbon it ain't working whatever huh button on the bottom there you go ta-da you may be seated now man i'll tell you brother anderson is definitely not leaving again you watching them buddy you're no nope no those listen there's a lot to do back there and i really appreciate those guys because as i'm talk as i'm telling you as i told you before there's a lot of things they do back there and they really don't i love it when they can come out and sit in the atmosphere of the service because there's a lot of things they do back there that they miss a lot but you know what god will will give them grace amen just like i always think about sisters that have children uh you know you have to go in and out and you know talking to a sister not too long ago she said well my kids you know my kids go in and out and i can't hardly listen to everything god will make a provision if you want him to do that if you want him to give you more he'll give you more he'll help you to understand but you know what you're doing also what the bible says you're bearing children and you'll be saved in childbearing not because you had the kid but because you want to be in church with them because you want to take them to the house of god and you want the word of god to be what prevalent and a part of their life all right so let's just for just a minute we'll go through this and then we're going to get on faith because faith is the bottom of the pyramid and it's really wise so we're going to try to cover some things about faith that maybe you've not thought of before and trying to make it more simple because remember childlike faith is what we must have even to be born again even to be healed even to come to church you had to have childlike faith even to get in your car and crank the thing up that's faith all right but there's a measure of faith and they want to speak on that this afternoon a measure of faith all right but everybody look we as christians we as the bride of jesus christ we are predestinated to something we're predestinated to adoption all right and we've got we've got to come to that so we've got to have faith for that time luther didn't have to have faith for an adoption wesley didn't have to have faith for an adoption but you and i are going to have to have faith for an adoption i was watching uh this morning a brother online a message preacher just seeing what people are preaching on and you know he said well you know he said if the rapture takes place next sunday and i'm not here don't worry about it but listen we gotta quit doing that because you get the people to believe that if you don't show up that the raptures took place we got to have a resurrection first there's got to be a resurrection before you can even talk about a rapture there's got to be a resurrection and only bride will know about the resurrection then according to the prophet of god we'll be around 30-40 days before the resurrection happens so let's get a resurrection here first let's start with each one of us having a resurrection in our heart that's what we've been trying to show you through justification and sanctification you ought to be able to walk this through your natural life and if you're not you're lost and it's okay to be lost it's okay but if you stay that way bob's been preaching on iniquity that's iniquity you sit in this church and you do things you're not supposed to do that's iniquity that's a hideous sin you know what you'll answer to god for it but remember your adoption's not your birth so we kind of ratcheted back a little bit and starting to talk about our birth because there's three stages as the baby comes there's three stages water blood and life there's three stages of adoption the first stage is the birth you've got to get the baby here that's what we were talking about last time we were preaching you got to get the baby here it doesn't matter it can be in the oven for nine months and that's not you know i i appreciate the uh roe versus wade i i we've always believed that hey man that that that you know life is life but we also know that brother brown told us that that baby was not a human being inside the womb he's not a human being or she until that baby is born smack and the spirit soul enters the baby all right so everybody with me on that all right so we're not political we're not worried about roe versus wade we know how to do it but you know what the people out in the world they are so they want to protest on this and they want to protest on that we just protest against the devil all right we're going to protest against the devil i want to make sure he knows i don't like him i don't like the things he makes me do because i help him hello we help him all the time but god's good all the time too let's read romans 8 says for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so we're when we talk about this afternoon we talk about faith you're going to have you have to have you have to have a connection when you have faith you can't have faith in something you don't know even a little bit about you got to know a little bit of something to base all that on that's why the basis the base what is the base it's the foundation the base is faith the base is get born again start living a good christian life everybody wants to just jump up on top of the pyramid and sit down up there ain't it happening you didn't become an adult you started as a baby that all right for as many of those are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god what do we have faith in the word of god that it will do what it said for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear listen if you're bound today just say god here's the confession i need you god to get me over this whatever put your you know put it inside your whatever your little box is i need to get over this all right i've not received the spirit of bondage against fear but you have received the spirit of adoption which puts you in the family of god by the new birth by being born again you're put into the family of god but you've not come to the adoption like it talks about in the bible the adoption in the bible is it's the son is born in the family and then he comes to a place and when he comes to a position when he has his schooling his schoolmaster his training his teaching then he comes to a place where the father says oh i can depend on him some now all right i can depend on him some now because remember full adoption is when our bodies changed everybody with me on that full adoption is when our bodies changed you can fully say we have been adopted we have made it we have been born again not being born again right because listen when we get to glory you're not going to need faith faith has given us here it's a substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen but when we get to there we're going to see everything we're going to see every promise took care of you're going to see everything you lost took care of you're going to see all that restored back so what do you need faith for you needed faith to come to church but you don't have to need faith right now that you in church i'm talking about faith for the time because you're going to have to have faith that god's going to answer your prayer today so see there's another faith that you got to deal with and that's what we'll talk about this afternoon i keep wanting to go to it now but we'll we'll hold off we need to stay on them we need to get us to that place because see i read you a quote and if i don't read this quote again this morning then you'll be confused brother brown says faith alone won't do it but everything is based on faith well what's he saying there's a measure of faith you've got to come to right here then there's a measure of faith going to take you to virtue measure of faith knowledge and all these different things so we'll get to it in just a second but you have to receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry and you know which father to cry to there was a father one time in the bible there was a man stood up and said you are of your father the devil amen but i know who my father is do you know who your father is we just come from father's day but we are the children of god or we are the progeny of god we are what god wanted to begin with all right and we're connected to god by dna spiritual dna not natural dna there's hardly anybody in this room that's that's that's tied together by natural dna unless it's your natural family but a lot of families sitting in here today all right but by the dna of god you and i everyone came from the same place amen by the new birth that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ thank god we get what he got thank god we're going to be in a city that you made by your desire but god made it you know what you know how special that city is that future home that city that we're going to live in satan has never and will never enter the gates now in the millennium he's still alive in the millennium he raises back up comes back onto the earth he's in the earth now he's in you now in your spirit realm even if you're born again amen but they're in that future home oh when john saw that thing come down that's why the whole world's everybody's going he said it's finished it's over it's done satan will not ever be able to enter into those gates he'll never be able to trouble us but we listen but we got to get what we've got to get a piece of it right now you and i you are your piece of that future home god has preserved you in your soul today by the new birth without it you're lost but let's get born again let's realize that we're lost let's realize that if we don't put faith in god's word then we're we're unbelievers that we may be glorified together we must suffer with him suffer with him to reign is that what the scripture says we must suffer to reign with him because see faith and suffering goes together here we go again i'll get to it this afternoon justification well you need faith if you don't have any problems think about it that's why it's so glorious in that future home and even us with a glorified body we got to worry about one thing nothing we can't fathom it but by faith we believe it's already happening by faith we believe that so we go to justification listen justification is i have not read this before but brother brown said it is an act of the holy ghost because there's only one person that can justify you and that's jesus christ amen so it's an act of the holy ghost because we know jesus christ is the holy ghost too amen so being justified freely by his grace not yours through the redemption that is in christ jesus not yourself whom god has sent forth to be a perpetuation what through faith in his blood we'll talk about that this afternoon through faith to declare what your righteousness nada his righteousness but if i get myself in him i can declare his righteousness and that makes me righteous i'm just telling you what the bible says for the remissions of sins that are past we know that that's why that we don't like i said before we we don't pray and i'm sorry but it's a i heard it the other day on another sermon that uh brother was praying for sins in the future ain't happening can't happen you can't pray for sins in the future you've got to pray for sins that have passed amen listen in god he knows what you're going to do and yes he knows he's going to forgive you or not forgive you because he's already seen it but you and i don't you and i have to make a choice you and i have to make a decision so just let's just pray last night i didn't pray for my sins today i prayed for my sins i did before and got forgiveness because he said i'll forgive you if you'll ask but i promise you one thing if you ask frivolously or you ask just because you want something god knows that too god knows your heart that's the problem we can hide but you can't hide from god all right let's sanctification matthew 12 verse 43 says my unclean spirit has gone out of a man walks through dry places seek rest and findeth none then he said i will return him to my house from whence i came out and when he has come he finally said empty swept and garnished in other words the old thing you used to do you don't do them anymore i told y'all before i used to curse you you didn't smoke much but a drank just telling you my story and before i was even born again that was taken away the things i used to do i do them no more right but i was in sanctification because i had been taught by a wonderful pastor that be careful that's a good place to be god had to take those things away from me but if you don't get it filled with something satan's going to come back and fill it up with him he's going to what he's going to take back his house and you're going to be worse because you're going to think you got something you don't but you know what you will and i all of us will manifest who we are this is manifest in time you know what it's manifesting time for god and it's manifesting time for the devil all right then go ahead and take it with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there in the last state of that man is worse than the first the bible says if you can't stand correction you're what bible we were quoting this morning your bastard child if you can't take care of your family you're an infidel the bible says i'm just reading you the bible you all want to be church you don't want to be message believers but you don't want to read that part of the bible worse than an infidel if you can't take care of your house hmm i'm just telling you what bible as like brother dale said don't get mad at me read it in your bible oh we want to read about the seals and the plagues and the vials well you bury your born again first you'll never understand it's just words you know what paul said one time he said you can know all mystery all paul said you know all mysteries and not have charity or perfect love or the new birth you're a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol amen so now look the prophet of god tells us talks about we've been talking about this for months please i i know it's helping some but i know others are just and then you're not going to have it it's just not i i wish it was 100 but you know what it's not going to be that way but you know what we deal with it you deal with it he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit now listen he's not going to give you the same spirit you had before if you're really in sanctification he's going to give you a new spirit that's attached to your spirit that what is going to start shedding off this junk shedding off this stuff that you used to do sanctification this is not the new birth this is sanctification now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him oh that's a little bit different but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you i want god to be comfortable living with me because i want him to live in me hey man so he has to get you fixed up first i like that has to get you fixed up first he gets you fixed up but you gotta allow him to fix you up then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places get you fixed up so you can entertain him right how do you entertain god all he wants is your faith all he wants is the word is you to do what the word said amen we got to have an absolute we'll talk about it this afternoon you've got to have faith in the word of god nothing else faith's final resting place the prophet said is in the word of god all right so you take it all back to the word of god that's why that i'm gonna say it again if you don't if church is not a part of your life you're not born again i'm gonna read it tonight i got uh this afternoon brother brown talks about faith meet god on his ground he said oh i can meet him out he established one scripture that you can't get away from for satan not the assembling of himself together and brother brown said if you're born again you can't wait for the doors to open up all right but you know why it's not because to make you do something come on it's not to make you do something i love june she don't have to make me love her but if you fall in love with jesus christ you'll want to be here because you know what where two or three are gathered in his name he said that's where he'd be in the myth and he wants to sing worship songs and he wants to have the communion and he wants to have the foot washing and he wants to have the baptism and he wants to have us to worship together let the worshiper arise in other words bring that worship to him he he's worthy of that worship nothing else is worthy of worship except god amen nothing else the world is worshiping everything else you watch them they're so crazy every little something goes on that people rush to it this is the thing this is the thing and then when that don't stay long enough this is the thing you know our attention spans got smaller and smaller remember that article somebody read a long time ago that now that movie producers used to you had to have you would have an exciting scene every 15 minutes and it would hold your attention now you have to have an ex exciting scene every two minutes to keep you excited to keep your goat well guess what if you're not excited about god he's not going to give you 15 minutes amen we're made to worship so that's when you're on the first altar but when you hide away you get his spirit then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you and then there's something about you the neighbor loves you the people likes you let's look at the baptism of the holy ghost real quick peter says seeing you have purified look you have purified your soul so you do have something to do with it you can sit today and just close it all off and just die and go to hell or you can open up and say god i gotta issue i got a problem i got something i need to work on god help me do this seeing you have purified your souls and what obeying the truth yes obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren an unfeigned love of the brethren doesn't mean what you think is not that's not filial love that's agape love see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently fervently why if you don't you won't get born again because that's paul b now peter says being born again not a corruptible seed you were born of that the first time but of incorruptible seed by the what by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever for all fleshes is grass and the glory of man's the flower of grass the grass withered and the flower therefore falls away but the word of god enjoy forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you for all the years this gospel has been preached it's going to come to a day of fruition it's going to come to a day that you're going to have to manifest exactly who you are you're going to know who you are and there'll be a time when they can't do nothing about it and you know what i want i want that time to to come where i'm so full of god i don't have nothing to do with it oh you were thought i was going to say the other way didn't you all thinking i was going to say yeah we're going to manifest yeah you are but i want to be so full of god so i can't get away from it so there's something happens all the time brother brown talks it he said it'd be like fireworks like popping popcorn pop pop pop pop it's what's gonna happen to the church i know we're sitting here sometimes you're like well this is they're not boring but you know this is just something we've been over and been through but everybody gets a piece of something all right the dispensation of the fullness of times which is right now he might gather together i think that's what he's doing he's gathering us together we used to sing a long time ago we are gathering together unto him amen he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him he worketh all things after the council of his will what is his will his will is his word all right we've come today to listen to the what reading of the will somebody died my daddy died and when my father died he left me something and i've come today to get what i see in the will that's why prophet god said his will is his word how do you want to know what god gives you read the bible healing faith all these different miracles and all the different just read it that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ and him also you trusted look after you heard the word of truth listen you had like i said i'm gonna talk about this afternoon but you can't have faith in the word of god if you never read it if you never read it what are you gonna have faith in well i got faith faith for what faith that god will do what he said in his will everybody with me and him also you trusted look you didn't trust him before in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also what after that you believed there's your faith faith in believing after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost which is the what earnest of your inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession in other words until everything is possessed listen the world is possessed with a devil but i won't be possessed with god that possess you know why it means that something comes in and resides there and you either like it or don't like it the world is possessed by the devil you and i should be possessed by god because we are what his possession purchased possession we are his purchase he purchased our sins at calvary went to hell to pay for my sins hung on a cross to pay for my sins but that's the earnest of our inheritance in other words it's a earnest of the key to that city but then once you open the door you got the full benefits of that city city built four square satan will never put his grubby feet in that thing oh that may ought to make you feel good there's one place satan will not be he will not be in that new city unto the praise of his glory john 14 25 these things have i spoken unto you what being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you remember we were talking about i believe it's in galatians where we're given school we're giving teachers schoolmasters to bring us to christ but after that it's not that we don't need those teaching anymore we need the real teachers which is good but you build your foundation listen your first grade teacher i remember ever i remember the first grade teacher that was kind of special because she was the one that you know you she took care of you and you were just a young kid and you didn't know what you were doing and where you were going and she kind of nurtured you around and and and helped you get started in school all right everybody with me on this that's the same way god is he sends the holy ghost to get you in the right building make sure you write you make sure you bring the right stuff right book make sure you're in the right place and that but now look that first grade teacher as much as you love her she's not going to the second grade with you you're getting a new teacher and that teacher teaches you through that grade but she doesn't follow you now look you know what follows you your mind what you thought of that first because see i remember my first grade teacher probably some of you do some of you probably a little bit older they can't remember that far back but that's okay you had one and everybody loves miss roberts where's hannah way in the back everybody and i got people now on my mail route that's well i'm gonna tell them how old they are because she taught them in school a bunch of years ago they're already adults with kids and they said oh we know miss robert she was our kindergarten teacher for my kid well see there there's an impression what they carried the impression with them but they didn't carry anna's anna wasn't set up in the 12th grade going all right come on now you go to that room right over there and you make sure go to the bathroom before you come into sanctuary i thought i'd put that one in there the teacher ought to teach you that we can sit for three hours and watch and watch going with the wind and never pee a drop not even think about it come on somebody we can sit watch a ball game football game you go to mess you're going to miss a play okay i'll just sit here but church you feel a little a little wiggled down there you know like your bladder is starting to fill up you go i know we have issues but you know what they make depends there is a way to not disturb the service some of y'all's kids got bladder about that size right there but you see them go play outside for two hours between services and they never go to the bathroom i just thought i'd throw at them in there but you know what god sees that he sees the effort you do make and the effort you don't make amen mama always made us she's i said mom i don't have to go to the bathroom go in and squeeze right mom go ahead go ahead you don't have to go in and squeeze you're not getting up when church starts you're not getting up during service we knew better than do that mom we she pinched these oh make more noise pensioners than it would anything else but you know what we learned a lesson go to the bathroom before we go in service well brother brown said what parental delinquency not kids i hear that i hear maybe i hear the kids say it man but i didn't hear many adults saying man on that let's continue on these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost see why he's going to be with you now see anna the teaching that anna had went with those people and they remember that but they didn't say i need to go back you can't go back in god you can't do that now listen if you backslide your back slid away from god now god's going to come get you if you're a child of his right but if you're not then he is not obligated to come back and get you amen he never went and got a child children of israel when they scattered he never he told him he said we're going in this direction you're going to the promised land all those went over here and married this one they went over married to moabites and went married this one that the other guy didn't go there and get them he gave him a choice he said you got to come back here all right that's the same way with us we've got to come back to the word of god whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance what the first great teacher told you everybody with me on that or the second grader the third grade i had a wonderful math teacher that's why i love math doc sis he made it he wanted a doctor but his name's doc seth and now he taught most of us that went to banks county but he was a super good teacher because he taught oh he was tough i had another girl named flunkin duncan she was in my grade she was with me in school she was rough they called her flunk and duncan if you didn't make the grade there wasn't no gray area i wish she was a christian she'd be a good one maybe god will save her but she was so adamant about you studying so adamant about you getting what she said in school so she would flunk you and it didn't matter but you know what she couldn't listen she didn't flunk a person that made 80s she flunked the one that made 60s that didn't care they didn't want to do it she and god's going to do that too he's not going to flunk you because you're in the 60s he's going to flunk you because you know what to do and you don't do it are you doing something wrong that you're not supposed to do and god's going to punish us if we're children if not we're just bastard children just like i said before if god doesn't correct us we're gone thank god for correction thank god for the chicken house opportunities like terrance does about every two times a week when daddy said let's go to the chicken house we're in trouble and ain't gonna see the chickens i promise you that cause there ain't no chickens in that chicken house so anyway he knows what i'm talking about and i don't know a thing about what we're talking about but acts 1 verse 4 and being assembled together with them but listen christianity can be molded with your life it is your life christianity or not being a christian it's molded in your life it's molded in your character and you can't get away from it that's why i love brother branham was a wonderful storyteller who was he telling most of his stories on his self good and bad amen he tell a story about about tying the string remember he had a temper oh prophet oh my god yeah he wasn't born again for those of you that don't believe that remember he said he'd tie that string he said the teacher told him to tie that string around and you know what is it tie ten knots or something or we used to say it was what count to sin brother brown i'm gonna go once leave her and he said i thought thing down and well when and your prophet would have been a murderer if it hadn't been for god your prophet would have been a suicide victim if it had not been for god because he told the story he didn't let his life be a secret he let his life be an open book i thank god brother claude brother claude said one time he said he said i'm glad you know brother brown said i can't keep in other words you can't keep a secret that's why he was built to give it to us he can't keep a secret from god the things he did keep secret he said it's for me and god but thank god he couldn't keep that secret that that he tried to shoot them kids with a 22 rifle and the bullets wouldn't go off now that he was up on a wire we think we're in trouble we think we got problems i'm going to preach a little bit here he is on a on a wire 16 feet up a pole 200 000 volts running across the top of him god had just listen god took his children his child because god told him he said this is happening because you didn't do what i told you to do am i all right so he lost his wife his baby died and he said god i'm done throw it off that glove and he said he reached to get the wire and he woke up down laying on the ground tried to commit suicide because his humanity had took over same way with the kids he was going to kill those kids and being a crack shot you know what he'd killed every one of them but god saved him god preserved him but he also didn't let him keep it secret he gave it so that he could tell me in you how that the saving grace of god as long as he is he see god knew i gotta what do you tell what you tell brother brown he said don't smoke drink curse and all this stuff cause i have a work for you later because remember at twenty-something years old remember brother brown said i'd be washing my car on sunday just so i didn't go to church i'd watch them church folks go to church oh the prophet of god that was already seeing vision saw his first vision at six years old absolutely knew there was something in his life that was following him absolutely i believe had a gift then but you know what didn't know how to use it so god didn't give him the keys same way with this adoption god's not gonna give you the keys if you're a baby but when brother brown grew up got the new birth oh that's hard for people to believe got the new birth he went through justifications how can he preach on it if he didn't go through it he couldn't preach it this is not some mystical thing that brother brown said i'll just get it from god and i ain't gonna have to worry about living it oh same way with us we had a prophet that number one he was a human he was a human being he had issues but you know what you don't hear him after he was born again you don't hear him having those same issues he didn't want to kill himself in the 50s and the 60s it was when he'd done something wrong amen so let's keep that in mind when we do something wrong we're going to get whipped we're going to get spanked but thank god for the spanking because you know what only my dad is going to spank me or my schoolmaster all right now sorry but when we grew up my daddy mama told the neighbor if we did something wrong with him try that today y'all be calling me going can you get me out of forsyth county jail man but one of y'all living for south county bob i listen for south county just came to my mind okay could have said hall county and it would have covered a lot more of you but since the forsyth county it covered bob and his face is red and and that gray is shining more than it is when that bottle hits all that his daughter made him inside joke and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem he's telling them what to do where to go to get this what's coming everybody with me this is acts the holy ghost is getting ready to fall being sent assembled together command to them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father wait go to jerusalem and wait until you're endued with power from on high you know what out of 500 people only 120 did it because he was seen at 500 brethren right 380 of them did not go what he did not do everything he told them to do these 120 dead they said all right let's go for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore come together they ask of him saying lord without see then have the new birth they think he's going to restore destroy the kingdom on the earth without the new birth we ask the same questions don't be silly we ask silly questions when we're not born again and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times of the seasons which the father have put in his own power but you shall receive power or dunamis after the after that's why brother brown says that the church the church nominal it's cold formal and powerless without the holy ghost you're powerless you say we've got signs and wonders we've got this that's gifts of god you can have gifts of god without having the new birth hmm amen but look here's what's going to seal the deal and ye shall be witnesses unto me to god both in jerusalem and all judea and samaria and look we are sitting today lula georgia is in the uttermost part of the earth all right so that dunamis means power mighty work strength miracles virtue strength power and ability inherent power did we just not say that you receive an inheritance yes your inheritance is power power over these things that listen like i said before your bills are not going to quit coming your car's not going to act up sister rebecca it's going to happen it's just things of life but you'll know how to handle them that's what we'll talk about this afternoon faith will teach you how to handle things if you'll just look at faith not the circumstances brother branham said this i'll read it this afternoon well no i'm going to save it he said he said if you say i'm a christian in a service he said but when you go home you say i'm not a christian he said you lose that confession you had i'll read it we believe brother brown was a prophet because he can only go by your confession inherent power power residing not on a thing anything in a thing you are the thing because the holy ghost is not in that drums someone with the holy ghost plays the drums but that's just drums like brother brown said he said it's not the mountain was holy he said it was a god on the mountain that was holy it's not that you and i are holy it's the god inside of us that makes us holy inherent power power residing in a thing by virtue what of its nature now there's a power natural power we'll talk about this afternoon there's a natural faith and we'll use some examples there's people that have faith out in the world that are just total whatever you want to call them lost all right people have faith carl wallenda everybody knows who that is well the younger people don't well freedom you know okay he was a high wire trapeze artist and he went across buildings you know hundreds of feet across buildings he actually come up here in toccoa and did it i mean high wire okay high wire he actually did it up here at the little gorge he walked across the gorge back in the 70s or something he walked on a one-inch wire at hundreds of feet high that takes faith i'm thinking about it ain't getting dizzy but he just went like took a chair with him and set the chair on that thing and sat down in the chair that takes faith but you know what his faith ended one day your faith won't but his faith ended one day because he had faith he said oh i'm not going to worry about this 10 mile an hour wind well you know what it come a 20 mile an hour wind and knocked him off and he fell to his death at about 150 feet but he had faith to do what he was doing that's just natural faith but the faith in god will never let you do that if you have faith that you're gonna make it you'll make it if you don't you won't power for performing miracles moral power and excellence of soul you know what carl juan linda they say he practiced every day he was 74 when he died when he fell off that building somewhere in las vegas or somewhere he should have been in las vegas sister rachel said amen you know what he done he took he he got out there and he got into circumstances they said the wire started doing this and he couldn't control it and he fell to his death but at 74 years old they said he practiced all the time i mean he was walking on something he was walking on something about that size it's hard for us to get up and walk on the floor but you know what he had faith something to he overcame a human ability that me you and me i mean i can get 20 30 feet in air deer hunting but uh not no 300 feet or 200 feet no i don't have that kind of faith listen i'm not required the bible says lord i'll be with you always you'll get that in a minute knowing brethren beloved aaron said yeah knowing brethren beloved your election of god for our gospel came not unto you in word only look not in word only it's not going to be listen we've got the mechanics we need the dynamics listen the world has got mechanics the world has mechanics what is mechanics what's in a book see their dynamics is going to be of satan our dynamics is going to be of god for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and look and in much assurance much assurance not a little bit of assurance when i told you about the 19 he always got baptized please please don't quit you can't quit you got to keep going look you got to have faith for our gospel came not only the word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and what any much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake and you became followers of us they didn't become followers of peter and paul a different one they were followers of the holy ghost that was inside of them listen there's an anointing that goes with that power there's an anointing that goes that brother branham tells us i was talking about this to myself this morning yesterday morning y'all don't ever do that i have the most intelligent conversation between me myself and i all three of us that trinity but you know what there's a power that you can create an atmosphere and brother brown said money women in popularity a preacher better watch out for money women in popularity you know why i'm not going to scare y'all i'm going to look see if this thing's working i'm sweating too it's on 78 degrees you don't not be 78 here aaron so i'm going to override it you hear that what a blessed noise what a blessed noise we're going to hold it right there all right fix it when you get done there it's your job so money women in popularity but that goes with a minister because you know what a minister is doing he's not pulling for your money you understand what i'm saying but there's a poll there why do you think these i'm going to say it anyway people like jesse duplantis he tells his congregation i need 200 million for a new airplane so i can get to my believers faster and he got it because there was a power of a pull well if he's a man of god he needs this and women that's what i told you before ministers young ministers i've watched for brother dale you keep yourself away from a woman there's a pull because you know what you're doing now i'm going to say this plain you're spiritually making love to the bride of jesus christ through christ is through you preaching the gospel the seed is falling and your what your conception has been it's just like that so you have to be careful and popularity what's popularity me gotta listen to me god come to me to get this and you know what they do they flock by millions millions of followers i'm like me and bob were talking about the other day you look on these some of these places and you you see that immediately a preacher puts up a a a sermon and they get 4 000 views we hardly get four well maybe 40 or 50. 100 if it's a good title and the longer the title well anyway but you see what they're doing it's a pull sheep needs a shepherd even though nominal christians even though they're not born in they need somebody to tell them what to do the world's not doing it politics is not doing it they need somebody so there's millions of views you know this preacher and i'm not talking about message breach i'm talking about you know oh well i like my beekeeper friend brother brother don cookie monster i guess i could call him brother he can walk out in his bee yard and say my bees are flying today he gets 45 000 views 20 second little snippet but the world is looking for information why are we not looking for information when there's only 100 and some views coming from this church for sermons there's almost that many people sitting here today just saying the world don't want everything they just want parts they just want to go so far and they don't want to go all the way you and i faith will take us all the way faith is a vehicle that's going to take us where we need to go all right but you've got to have a little bit of faith in yourself i know we put all of our faith in god but brother brian i'm going to read you a quote where brother brown says god will never save you if you don't let him he'll never heal you if you don't let him because he's already healed us everyone in calvary two thousand twenty two hundred years ago and what we're still dying now when god is silent we better be silent where he's spoken we'd better speak to and say what he already said he told he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the holy ghost that we would have the teacher come and teach us all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher well brother way then we don't have to go to church we don't have to listen to a teacher that's not what he's saying he's saying you got to have that teaching and then it will agree with the and the inside teacher is going to say give me more give me more the inside teacher will tell you to go to church look he can't deny his word there's no way he can deny his word that's why we got to put faith final resting places in the word of god not how you feel he's not a high priest of your feelings he's a high priest of your confession and if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth let me read that one more time if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day 1100 servants rounding around the world from 1965 until today it has not done away with one denomination it has not kept women of the world from cutting their hair wearing skirts not wearing pants only the elect it's who that was too and you have to decide whether you're that elect or not that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of paul those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it oh here's the tough one and live by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin in every age and every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them you're going to hear your part of the word today if you've got the holy ghost he's obligated to take that and spin it around not put a spin on it spin it around in your soul mix it with faith mix it with some faith and say that ain't nothing but the truth had it right change two boys lives that ain't nothing but the truth the little wash woman didn't have two nickels brother brown said to rub together and they were of the group that heard the message messenger looked and his message and took it and lived it wherefore land inside all malice all guile hypocrisies and envies all evil speaking as newborn babes we have to start there desiring the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be that you have what if so be that you've tasted that the lord is gracious first corinthians 12 3 musicians get ready to come wherefore i give you to you give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus a curse and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost and we were talking about the potter so we'll get we'll skip through that now we know that simon peter serving the apostle of jesus christ of them that have obtained light precious faith all right like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus our lord according as his divine power that dunamis that holy ghost has given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness put god first we don't do that i don't do that you know we don't do it enough do you ever just wake up in the morning and say god thank you for getting me up kids you may not do that but as you get older i promise you god thanks for waking me up because there's what millions of people didn't wake up this morning that hath called us into glory and virtue whereby or given unto us exceeding great precious promises that by these you might be partakers of that divine nature what is the divine nature of god the bible is the divine nature of god you read the divine nature of god even in the old testament listen folks there's grace in that old testament we know there's a law but there's grace in the old testament folks i mean come on rahab ruth you know ruth was a mobile woman and do you know that according to the law she could not enter a congregation of the jews for four ten generations four years but she married the king she married boaz and boaz says whatever she is i'll take it gentile whatever you are i know you're a bunch of dogs but i'll take you you know what our boat said i know you passed i know you came from a bad situation i know you came from moab but now you're in my house and i'm going to take you for a bribe and i'm even going to put the lineage of my son through that rahab a ruth wasn't a virgin either whoa her husband was dead she wasn't very pure either she was a mobilist they should have kicked her back into her country but boaz said no i'll cover whatever she's done i'll cover it whatever you've done today i'll cover it i'll cover it because you're my bride make a step toward him and he'll make a step towards you ruth laid down that floor and she said give me that skirt that you've got i want it to cover me let's stand to our feet i wanted to cover me today besides just giving all diligence add to your faith now faith is the substance come on musicians faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and we'll keep reading you know what we'll start and read it later on but without faith look without faith is impossible to please god you can't please god without faith for he that cometh to god must believe that what he is what he is god amen and that he is a rewarder of them that come every once in a while that diligently seek him now you cannot be was saved without faith faith is something that you have to believe is there there's really nothing else will declare it but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for a prayer line in the next few minutes look watch this we'll read this and then we'll stop it's impossible to please god without faith you cannot please him and if you say you believe god you've never seen him see so when you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith like coming to church i i i don't believe that that i'm going to meet louise in church today i'm looking at it but i had to have faith in the journey to get here you got to have faith in a journey to get you to a place you got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it'd be no more faith anything that the senses declare is no more faith it's a scientific fact so we must believe first believe this is god's word and you must come to god by the word you've got to come by the word of god we'll talk about it this afternoon god bless you let's sing a song just one just one verse it's almost 12 o'clock just sing the chorus that's just his way that's just his way of telling me he loves me oh it's a love beyond all human understanding that's what faith is it's beyond everything that you're saying [Music] thank you lord [Music] he gave us away [Music] is [Music] is [Music] a love beyond all human understanding and i will question trial that bring me to my knees you
