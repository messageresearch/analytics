[22:44] don't love it out here
[22:47] good to be back brother Claude sends his
[22:50] greetings brother Jim Pinkston to each
[22:51] one of you
[22:53] they said greetings and hope everyone's
[22:58] doing well so if you got your Bibles
[23:00] let's go and get straight in to the word
[23:04] we're gonna try to conclude this today
[23:08] and on the to life and this would be the
[23:15] conclusion we've kind of hit on certain
[23:22] things here and there but I kind of want
[23:23] to nail it down and make sure that that
[23:26] would get everything where people can
[23:29] understand we were out in Oklahoma and
[23:34] talking to people out there and it just
[23:36] seems that there's a there's a zeal
[23:40] among the people to know more and it's
[23:44] it's not our job to belittle you and
[23:47] make you think you don't know nothing
[23:49] because God is bringing somebody up God
[23:53] is gonna fulfill what he said regardless
[23:56] of who you are where are you gonna be it
[23:58] does not matter I just want to be part
[24:00] of amen I just want to be part of it I
[24:04] don't want to draw anybody out we want
[24:08] to draw them all in what you need to do
[24:11] is just let it go and let them draw
[24:13] their self out so that's what he's going
[24:15] to come up to they'll just draw their
[24:16] self right out of the picture so I was
[24:19] thinking yesterday you know jesus knew
[24:24] he picked Judas he knew he was gonna do
[24:29] what he did he knew he was the son of
[24:31] perdition but now he's a liar if he
[24:34] didn't say the truth when he called
[24:36] Judas a friend
[24:38] he like Judas there was something about
[24:41] Judas that Jesus liked and he called him
[24:43] friend he call him brother he called him
[24:45] friend but I can see the agony that
[24:48] Jesus was having of that one person
[24:50] among him knowing all along what he
[24:53] would do but yet he never treated you
[24:55] decide on't think any different because
[24:56] you know what when they went to the
[24:57] upper room and he told you this to go do
[25:00] what he was gonna do the other eleven
[25:02] were so deceived they didn't even know
[25:04] he was the one that was going out to
[25:05] sell Jesus out and but jesus knew that
[25:08] so he had he had not treated Judas any
[25:12] different but what he done was is he let
[25:15] Judas manifest itself in other words the
[25:17] same thing we you know he's God's gonna
[25:18] let us manifest ourselves and that's why
[25:21] we're here that's why we've been here 50
[25:22] something years since the prophets left
[25:25] the scene 60 years a we're gonna show
[25:28] who we are we're gonna come to a
[25:30] maturity show who we are and then we're
[25:34] gonna be out of here
[25:35] and that's that's just the way it's
[25:37] going to be we're gonna leave this place
[25:39] we were talking out there where you know
[25:42] III don't spend a lot of time on the
[25:45] peripherals you know all that stuff is
[25:47] gonna happen to Israel and the Russian
[25:49] of this and that that's gonna happen but
[25:51] it cannot happen without God doing
[25:54] something for us first because signs
[25:57] follow the believer the signs are back
[26:01] here we're up here in the forefront
[26:04] so whatever signs happen God's already
[26:06] done something to us or with us because
[26:09] remember he does it right right reveals
[26:14] that makes it manifest all right so who
[26:16] any and it's not to the Moon and stars
[26:19] it's to you and I at one time at one
[26:22] dispensation he was in the stars amen
[26:25] first Bible then he come to the pyramid
[26:28] then to us well not to say that that has
[26:30] nothing to do sure it's very significant
[26:32] but this bride is what he's got isn't
[26:36] mind on these guys mind on the bride
[26:37] right now and us doing what we're
[26:41] supposed to do in the Word of God so
[26:43] let's read this in first Peter 1 verse 3
[26:47] and we're going to background just a
[26:49] little bit but then we're going to bring
[26:50] it out
[26:52] close it back together and we'll see
[26:54] what we got
[26:56] did you read the that was the what the
[27:00] questions and answers on the seals you
[27:01] saw that right did you see what brother
[27:04] Branham was doing he was telling those
[27:06] people they wasn't getting it he was
[27:09] telling those people that they wasn't
[27:10] supposed to get it ma'am he said there's
[27:14] he said in other words there's ready
[27:16] there's people walking through here
[27:17] there's voices walking through here but
[27:19] they have nothing to pick it up but now
[27:21] you and I we have the right receptors we
[27:26] have the right crystal in the in the
[27:29] radio to now be able to pick up what the
[27:32] prophet of God is talking about he
[27:34] didn't belittle him he didn't know he
[27:35] didn't call him out he said just live a
[27:37] good Christian life because he knew that
[27:39] there was a group of people on the earth
[27:40] that would have the right receptor and
[27:43] the right they would have the right
[27:45] pressure and they would have actually
[27:47] have the right revelation because look
[27:49] what happened after the seals broke all
[27:50] kind of revelations came out that were
[27:52] false but there's a truth now that we're
[27:55] coming to the honing part like I told
[27:57] you a couple of Sundays ago we're coming
[27:59] to the pencil sharpening this now where
[28:00] God's not cutting big chunks off he's
[28:02] cutting just a little bit and he's he's
[28:05] just he's rubbing that old car and
[28:07] getting it smooth getting ready to paint
[28:08] the car you know he's not he's not
[28:10] beating the dents out I hope he's not
[28:13] beating the dents out and I hope we got
[28:14] to where we we're not at the you know we
[28:18] were a wreck you know and he did start
[28:19] putting this together but now he's
[28:21] smoothing us out getting ready to take
[28:23] us out of here so we love the Lord and
[28:26] love you thanks for your prayers thanks
[28:29] for all the things that we do around
[28:30] here all the people that pick up and do
[28:31] when the other ones are not here we all
[28:33] really appreciate that so first Peter 1
[28:36] verse 3 through 5 let's pray your
[28:38] heavenly Father we pray that you'll be
[28:40] with us today Lord be the one that does
[28:43] the speaking the hearing you be the one
[28:45] Lord that gives revelation because
[28:47] without you there is none without you
[28:50] it's just a meeting where we read some
[28:51] words and go home my father made this
[28:54] spark home in our hearts and that will
[28:56] be drawn closer to you father that this
[29:00] will literally pull us into a body
[29:03] change literally pull us
[29:05] all the dead Saints out of the ground
[29:07] and we'll go out of here Lord and it
[29:10] will be surely a time like no other time
[29:13] before there's never been a day like
[29:16] this day when Lord you knew that you put
[29:19] us here you gave us a word you equipped
[29:20] us so you're the one that's gonna have
[29:23] to do it Lord because you're on the
[29:24] scene now more than ever in your bride
[29:27] father forgive us of our sins be with us
[29:29] as we read your word Lord just bless us
[29:31] sanctify us be with the ones that are
[29:32] sick the ones that are not here Lord be
[29:34] with the missionaries on the foreign
[29:35] fields give them fruit for their labor
[29:37] father just bless us in Jesus name we
[29:39] pray amen
[29:40] 1st Peter 1 verse 3 says blessed be the
[29:43] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[29:44] which according now to his abundant
[29:47] mercy has begotten us again unto a
[29:50] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[29:52] Christ from the dead now we remember the
[29:54] last time we talked we were talking
[29:55] about inheritance alright so we're gonna
[29:57] still continue a little bit on that to
[30:00] an inheritance incorruptible and
[30:03] undefiled that fadeth not away I like
[30:07] that reserved in heaven for you alright
[30:11] you got that reserved in heaven for you
[30:13] alright
[30:14] who are kept by the power of God through
[30:16] faith unto salvation ready to be
[30:19] revealed right now in the last times
[30:24] right now this is the scripture this is
[30:26] a brother clock now we're talking about
[30:28] some things and he started saying some
[30:30] things but but the point you get out of
[30:32] it is this is the this is a now
[30:34] scripture right now there was times past
[30:38] when we had examples in the Bible it
[30:40] says that the Old Testament was given
[30:41] for example alright it was given for
[30:43] example but this is a now scripture in
[30:45] the last time this time is when that's
[30:48] supposed to be revealed so this must be
[30:51] preached in this hour and be made
[30:53] manifest according to what that just
[30:55] says right there through faith under
[30:57] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[30:59] last time let's read Galatians 2:20
[31:00] we've been reading it all along I am
[31:03] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[31:05] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[31:09] and the life which I now live even in
[31:13] the flesh I live by the faith of the Son
[31:17] of God who loved me
[31:18] and gave himself for me you may be
[31:21] seated in the Lord as a blessing to the
[31:23] reading of the word now I'm going to
[31:25] read this quote that we've read - and
[31:26] then I'll start shouldn't be too long
[31:29] today because I want to I just want to
[31:31] bring a couple of points and then we'll
[31:33] be finished number one quote is
[31:35] thirsting for life we've read this from
[31:37] before
[31:38] listen where did sin begin sin began at
[31:43] the Garden of Eden and sin has an end so
[31:45] if David crying oh Lord my God my soul
[31:47] is thirsting for the end of dry land
[31:49] where no water is for thy
[31:50] loving-kindness is better to me the life
[31:52] there must be two different types of
[31:55] life and there is two types of life and
[31:59] when a man is born in this world he's
[32:01] nothing but a product of sin when he's
[32:03] born because he's from sexual desire
[32:05] he's just a product of sin the Bible
[32:07] says he is he's born in sin shape than
[32:09] income to world speaking lives and yet
[32:11] he's got life you cannot negate that we
[32:15] were sure we were born dead we know that
[32:17] but we have a life that we're living
[32:18] where even when we were sinners we have
[32:20] life and yet he's got life but that life
[32:23] is a perverted life that life was Satan
[32:27] cannot create life
[32:28] he can only pervert what God has created
[32:31] Satan has no way remember Satan doesn't
[32:33] have a seat he had to borrow a seed the
[32:36] Serpent's seed he had to borrow a seed
[32:37] from the serpent - what reproduce and
[32:40] inject his self brother Jewell did a
[32:42] like they said that was the capstone of
[32:44] his of his message on Wednesday night if
[32:46] you missed it you need to listen to it
[32:48] alright there's only one creator that's
[32:50] God he's a good evangelist but boy he
[32:52] can bring some powerful evangelism hey
[32:55] man he's good he's unique he can he can
[32:58] he can step over and do a little bit
[33:00] teaching everyone why Satan couldn't
[33:03] heal medicine couldn't heal there's
[33:04] nothing else can heal but God because
[33:05] he's the only creator and anybody that's
[33:08] intelligent would know enough to know
[33:09] that there's not a medicine drug or
[33:11] nothing in the world can create life
[33:14] alright we've man's trying to do
[33:16] everything in the world but they cannot
[33:18] create life amen God's the only creator
[33:21] and the only one that create life then
[33:24] what does Satan do he perverts that life
[33:26] that God has created that's the first
[33:28] life and that's what we're going to look
[33:29] at in just a minute now we see the diff
[33:32] types of life that's the reason that
[33:34] this means born is a product of Adam and
[33:37] we're going to talk about that in a
[33:38] minute and brother jewel did a good job
[33:39] we in speaking on Adam and Eve which is
[33:42] just the punctuation of what we've been
[33:43] what we've been speaking on you know for
[33:46] months now which was a product of sin
[33:48] from listening to his wife and the wife
[33:50] was a product of sin come from Satan and
[33:53] Adam followed his wife out a perfect
[33:56] type of Christ going with his bride to
[33:58] take her sins as Adam took the sin of
[34:01] even left the garden to be not deceived
[34:03] but willingly walked out with her so was
[34:06] Christ not deceived Satan could not
[34:08] deceive him if thou be the Son of God he
[34:10] knew that he was but he deliberately
[34:12] walked down and took sin for the church
[34:14] he's our sin bear now everything that
[34:17] come out of that look watch this now
[34:19] everything that come out of that cycle
[34:20] of eternal life when that goes back into
[34:23] its cycle again into that ceaseless
[34:25] eternity not one shape form of standing
[34:27] any way will ever enter then here's one
[34:29] Baptist that believes in holiness and we
[34:31] see that that cycle of we look at
[34:33] eternity Lord we've talked about being
[34:35] in a circle but remember we fell out we
[34:38] fell we fell down out of that circle mm
[34:41] that's why they call it the fall but
[34:43] remember it did not disconnect us in the
[34:47] way that like I said before we didn't
[34:49] lose our relationship Adam didn't lose
[34:53] the title or being of the Son of God
[34:56] he's the son of God
[34:58] amen but he lost his fellowship he lost
[35:01] that closeness for him and God could get
[35:03] together and talk face-to-face lived
[35:06] here right Amen so there's what we look
[35:09] and we see that that enmity in genesis
[35:11] 3:15 let me read a few of these and then
[35:12] we're going to talk about corruptible
[35:14] and incorruptible seed and i will put
[35:16] enmity because remember in genesis 3:15
[35:18] God already knows he knew what happened
[35:23] but he is literally looking at Adam and
[35:25] Adam and Eve has already been pregnant
[35:29] so we see that that there's a new kind
[35:32] of life coming in not that God said that
[35:35] there he said Adam and Eve right I had
[35:39] him and Eve like like brother Jules told
[35:41] me it's Adam and Eve and they were
[35:43] supposed to bring forth God's children
[35:46] and but we know what happened in the
[35:49] fall and then God had to divide or put a
[35:53] division and I will put enmity between
[35:55] thee and the woman between thy seed over
[36:01] here this hand and her seed and we know
[36:05] that a woman doesn't have a seat so we
[36:07] know he was speaking of Christ coming to
[36:09] bring a new life a new birth something
[36:12] that Nicodemus Nicodemus kept falling
[36:14] over here on this side the natural seed
[36:17] amen all right in 1st Peter 1 verse 22
[36:20] let's read that seeing you have purified
[36:24] your souls in obeying the truth through
[36:25] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[36:27] Brethren see that you love one another
[36:29] with a pure heart fervently being born
[36:32] again not of corruptible seed but of
[36:35] incorruptible how by the Word of God
[36:40] which liveth and abideth for ever now
[36:43] remember this is not this corruptible
[36:46] seed sure we know that it has a compound
[36:50] meaning it's corruptible word but it was
[36:53] the actual seed of Adam that corrupted
[36:56] the whole thing we talked about serpent
[37:00] seed well brother Branham said Adam's
[37:02] seed is one that lost it right amen
[37:04] Adams the one that sold us out America
[37:08] let's read here now and talk about
[37:10] because when you talk of corruptible
[37:12] seed remember that has nothing to do
[37:14] with God there is no corruption in God
[37:19] and then so when you talk about
[37:21] corruption we must be talking about this
[37:23] first life and then because this first
[37:27] life comes from a natural act between a
[37:29] woman and a man a carnal act between a
[37:32] man and a woman and that seed is a
[37:35] natural seed but all they done was is
[37:37] like brother Joel said Satan knew that
[37:40] God said each seed will bring forth of
[37:43] its kind so that's how he can interject
[37:46] himself into the human race because when
[37:50] an act happened God had to step in by
[37:54] his own word think about that God had to
[37:58] step in by his own
[37:59] word and bring cane whatever you want to
[38:04] say God had to give him life
[38:07] the beefs couldn't give him life Eve
[38:10] couldn't give him life God had to give
[38:13] him life listening that's why I believe
[38:16] that all men are able to be saved
[38:19] because God can't say I'm going to bring
[38:22] this person and bring them lost sure we
[38:24] know by the mind of God listen we preach
[38:27] this I don't have to talk I don't have
[38:29] to give you background God knew the
[38:33] histor
[38:34] Cain and he knew what would happen to
[38:36] Judas he knew what would happen to Adolf
[38:39] Hitler but he still give them the same
[38:41] opportunity because he said I hope you
[38:44] have come by the way I said permissive
[38:47] though not perfect well but permissive
[38:49] will comes remember once the seed was
[38:51] planted and Eve that stopped everything
[38:53] right there that stopped God's first
[38:56] program okay which is a line of eternity
[39:01] with no ending and no beginning amen it
[39:06] brought us down to another life and then
[39:12] corruptible though like brother Joel
[39:14] said I've always the Bible tells us
[39:16] we're supposed to cry when the baby's
[39:18] born and rejoice when a saint goes home
[39:21] no what do we do oh pretty little baby
[39:24] that baby is a product of sin and will
[39:28] die eventually amen so why are we so
[39:36] happy when babies are born but that's
[39:42] the first life that's the first life and
[39:46] listen that is permissive will that is
[39:49] all down in this dimension I was
[39:50] thinking the other day we we talked
[39:52] about life light and matter God had to
[39:54] bring that down into this dimension the
[39:57] first three dimensions because of what
[39:59] he said he said each seed will bring
[40:01] forth of his kind
[40:02] so Satan knew that he could bring God he
[40:05] could bring everything down here
[40:06] because remember he fell from up there
[40:09] to here
[40:10] amen so he had to do his due
[40:12] he work down here right my brother Joel
[40:16] said he couldn't do his dirty work
[40:17] through Adam Adam had the mind of God
[40:21] there was no way he could tap in and try
[40:23] don't you think Satan stood and said let
[40:25] me see if I can get to him first
[40:27] just to Satan he has no way you could
[40:29] have got to Adam but the but the one
[40:32] that came out of Adam he knew that what
[40:35] she could bring forth exactly what he's
[40:38] thinking about
[40:38] amen so now the corruptible seed now
[40:42] let's read here in first Corinthians
[40:45] 15:21 for since by man came death but
[40:50] man came also but by man came also the
[40:54] resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam
[40:57] all die even so in Christ shall all be
[41:01] made alive so when we drop down here
[41:05] redemption was already there I was
[41:07] thinking yesterday you know we we go
[41:10] over into Revelations and we see that
[41:12] there was a white stone right
[41:15] revelations 2 I think I wrote it in the
[41:17] back of my notes revelations 2:17 this
[41:24] is very simple
[41:25] everybody wants another revelation of
[41:27] that I got the revelation yesterday God
[41:31] is writing our names down all right God
[41:37] is writing our names down in Satan's
[41:38] looking over shoulder you say oh he
[41:42] can't do that yeah can he can do that
[41:45] Saint can look over his shoulder
[41:47] st. looked over shoulder but what
[41:49] happens when you put red through red you
[41:54] get what
[41:59] there's your revelation of you white
[42:01] stone God's got your name wrote down and
[42:04] Satan can't see it called this red
[42:07] through red it's white that page to
[42:10] Satan is blank white that page to God
[42:13] has all of his children written on every
[42:16] stone of that page mmm because remember
[42:21] God is not going to ever be defeated
[42:25] and there are certain things that Satan
[42:28] does not know and that's one of them I
[42:31] don't believe he knows your name pretty
[42:37] good to me
[42:38] amen but I could just see old Satan you
[42:42] know he's looking over God's shoulder
[42:44] and he sees there's something in there
[42:46] red and then Jesus just writes over it
[42:50] in his own blood and it totally
[42:52] disappears because read through red is
[42:55] white there it's where you and I are
[43:00] totally hidden from Satan if you're in
[43:05] Christ now if you're not then you're not
[43:08] you know what if you're not your names
[43:10] written in your blood of this earthly
[43:12] journey and if you don't get it wiped
[43:15] out by the blood of Jesus Christ guess
[43:17] what your name is in big bold letters
[43:20] hey man and Satan has read that because
[43:23] you know what that's the book he's gonna
[43:25] be looking at amen
[43:27] that's why you're not how you gonna hold
[43:28] somebody in judgment when the sheet
[43:30] looks like this now if it looks like
[43:33] this this is your worst do's and don'ts
[43:37] and all that other stuff
[43:39] see that's the corruptible seed all
[43:41] corruptible seed has do's and don'ts
[43:45] amen because remember and I'll read it
[43:49] to you in just a minute a little quoted
[43:50] on that came up with your first life you
[43:54] were not born by faith we don't live in
[44:01] our first life in a realm of faith we go
[44:05] outside we get in the car we started we
[44:07] don't pray before we start the car do it
[44:09] we don't pray before we go to the
[44:12] mailbox to get our government check some
[44:16] of y'all some of us have to work to give
[44:19] you your government the moment then boom
[44:24] in inter at the cafe they said where you
[44:26] going I said I'm going to work so I can
[44:28] pay you how do I get off on that I don't
[44:33] know but anyway we don't live by faith
[44:38] in our natural life
[44:40] but now look brother Brown said the same
[44:43] faith that you have to go get in your
[44:45] car and start it he says that's the
[44:48] faith you should have as a Christian
[44:50] what is that God you're going to do it
[44:53] but we don't live but we weren't born by
[44:56] faith come on we worked we don't live by
[45:03] faith in this natural life we live by
[45:07] the law we live by the law and I'll
[45:13] prove it to you here in just a second
[45:15] let's read the quote number two then
[45:20] we'll get back to that I got a little
[45:21] head of myself Revelation chapter 1 but
[45:24] thank God
[45:24] weren't out of this world see so there
[45:27] there you are seeing where it now look I
[45:29] don't mean the church he don't control
[45:31] the church he just controls the world
[45:33] he's how much Satan well he controls the
[45:36] church too now but he said they were his
[45:38] and he's the god of the world Jesus said
[45:40] he was and he is he's the god of the
[45:42] earth has blinded the eyes of the people
[45:43] to go to this earth he's the God of
[45:45] heaven now he rightly don't own this he
[45:49] does not own it but he's forfeited look
[45:51] and Adam forfeit the title deed to it to
[45:54] this all this stuff that we own eternal
[45:56] life and the inheriting of the earth
[45:58] jesus said in Matthew 5 blessed are the
[46:00] meek shall inherit the earth see now we
[46:02] don't have it now and look it wasn't to
[46:04] Adam or any of his seeds okay Adam seed
[46:10] absolutely lost everything - it's not
[46:15] the seed of Adam no matter how much we
[46:19] try to beautify this world and how much
[46:22] we try to make big fine homes and things
[46:24] that's why we don't we don't believe
[46:26] that doctrine that they're teaching in
[46:28] the message that item had to plan this
[46:30] literal seed in the ether savor that
[46:32] proves it right there
[46:33] how can a literal corruptible seed save
[46:37] anybody our problem is that's why we
[46:41] were born this way it's the problem that
[46:43] we have I don't try to turn it into some
[46:46] glorious no listen I'm sorry I know
[46:51] there's children here but remember the
[46:52] Bible says
[46:53] it is undefiled you know it doesn't mean
[46:54] that you don't supposed to have we're
[46:56] humans okay
[46:58] let's don't be monks we weren't made to
[47:01] be monks God said what multiply
[47:03] replenish the earth and we're doing the
[47:04] best we can some of y'all are doing a
[47:06] whole lot better than others we got
[47:11] multiples of four around here for us for
[47:13] no more
[47:15] where's bobbing them they're not bottoms
[47:17] not here when we preach it on gluey
[47:19] goodness gracious
[47:21] but look it still doesn't belong to Adam
[47:24] seed listen Adam forfeited this earth
[47:26] and then so anything that Adam brings
[47:30] forth naturally now listen I'm talking
[47:34] corruptible don't go into in corruption
[47:36] because we're incorruptible now no no we
[47:38] are in corruption now okay we're getting
[47:42] to incorruptible in a minute but in
[47:44] corruption now nothing will inherit the
[47:47] kingdom of God the Bible says flesh and
[47:50] blood will not inherit the kingdom
[47:52] amen all right that's why it still
[47:57] doesn't belong to Adam see no siree did
[47:59] not go to Adam see no sir because Satan
[48:02] took it lock stock and barrel for Adam
[48:05] forfeited it all right now Galatians
[48:07] 3:16 explains it all
[48:11] everybody say Amen now - I told him I
[48:15] wouldn't move around sorry brother
[48:18] Jeffrey's back there he's in training
[48:27] now to Abraham he's people at her own
[48:33] wine they're going I don't know what but
[48:37] here explains it now to Abraham now
[48:39] become mine Abraham and his seed were
[48:41] the promises made there was no promise
[48:43] to Adam not Adam seed now that was a
[48:47] promise to Adam the Son of God Genesis
[48:51] 1:26 brother Dale Reddy's this morning
[48:53] Genesis 1:26 God it is not it Genesis
[48:59] 1:26 does not get a promise it is the
[49:02] promise it is the promise in other words
[49:06] the promise
[49:06] is I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it
[49:09] through that Genesis 1:26 man that's the
[49:12] way it's going to be done that's why I
[49:14] love that Genesis 1:26 cuz it just it
[49:16] just takes everything and puts it into
[49:19] one scripture Redemption salvation
[49:22] eternity it's all in Genesis 1:26
[49:26] now to Abraham and his seed where the
[49:28] promises made he says not and to seeds
[49:32] as a mini so it was not Abraham's
[49:34] natural seed because remember Abraham
[49:37] had the promised son and then he went
[49:40] and got married again and had seven more
[49:41] children so I had nothing and they
[49:43] weren't even counted it shmo wasn't even
[49:47] counting Isaac was counted what for the
[49:51] promise of natural seed not spiritual he
[49:56] says not to seeds as of many but as of
[49:59] one my brother Dale was preaching this
[50:01] morning I see one theophany but many
[50:05] theophanies inside that but not
[50:07] different ones the same one attributes
[50:12] you have to bring attributes now we
[50:15] talked about attributes the other day
[50:16] and to thy seed which is Christ
[50:19] so Genesis 1:26 it's not brother Bram
[50:23] said that wasn't all mankind it's one
[50:26] man that the Alpha knew of God one man
[50:29] coming into view stepping into the
[50:31] forefront and said Here I am all right
[50:34] now look it keeps going
[50:37] let's read it because it gets good and
[50:40] this I say that's a covenant that was
[50:43] confirmed before of God in Christ the
[50:46] law which was four hundred and thirty
[50:48] years after cannot dissin all that it
[50:52] should make the promise of none effect
[50:53] what was the promise to Abraham seed
[50:56] you'll possess this land you will have a
[50:57] child you're going to do this you're
[50:59] gonna write unconditional covenant
[51:01] because remember this first life that we
[51:04] live is in conditioner condition the
[51:09] first life look at me the first life
[51:11] we're living right now is under
[51:12] condition you were born a baby you had
[51:15] to eat you had to go to school you had
[51:17] to do this yet that's law
[51:19] and it's proves it right here for if the
[51:22] inheritance be of the law see there it
[51:25] is if the inheritance be of the law it
[51:27] is no more promise what is the promise
[51:30] of promises I'm going to give you
[51:31] something with no strings attached
[51:34] the law doesn't do that the law gives
[51:36] you a law with strings attached you do
[51:39] this you get this you do this you don't
[51:42] do that
[51:43] but the promise is God's that I'm gonna
[51:45] do it but God gave it to Abraham by
[51:50] promise
[51:51] so the inheritance is not of the law
[51:56] it's of grace we'll get to that in a
[52:00] minute because we've got to get to the
[52:01] incorruptible part wherefore then
[52:04] serveth the law it was added because of
[52:08] transgressions what till the seed should
[52:11] come to the promise was made
[52:13] listen Abraham's seed wasn't in the Old
[52:15] Testament it just tells you right here
[52:20] wherefore then serveth the law the law
[52:23] was added because transgression because
[52:25] the blood of bulls and goats couldn't
[52:27] take away sin it only covered sin that
[52:31] was the law and then until til the seed
[52:37] who is that Christ delay genesis 3:15
[52:40] the woman's seed come till the seed
[52:43] should come to whom the promise was made
[52:46] and it was ordained by angels in the
[52:49] hand of a mediator now who's our
[52:51] mediator Christ now a mediator is not a
[52:55] mediator of one but God is one is the
[52:59] law then against the promises of God god
[53:01] forbid you can't do away with law right
[53:04] look for if there had been a law given
[53:08] which could have given life so remember
[53:11] the law gives death amen
[53:14] that's your first life if you don't have
[53:17] your first life taken into Christ for
[53:21] your new life you're dead literally dead
[53:28] the Bible says she's what dead while
[53:31] she's living man that's us we're dead
[53:34] that's why little baby so much life and
[53:36] so much bigger and so much man I get
[53:39] tired watching kids sometimes with so
[53:42] much life but that life has taken them
[53:44] right straight to death and then it's
[53:46] the law then against the promises of God
[53:48] god forbid for if there had been a law
[53:51] given which could have given life verily
[53:53] righteousness would have been by the law
[53:56] but look the scripture take it back to
[54:00] the Word of God but the scripture hath
[54:02] concluded all under sin that what that
[54:07] the promise by faith of Jesus Christ
[54:11] might be given to them that believe
[54:16] first first life second law first life
[54:23] second left amen
[54:25] but before faith came we were kept under
[54:28] the law what'd I say we were born under
[54:31] the law we were born unbelievers with no
[54:35] faith I don't see how people walk
[54:39] through the world but you know what you
[54:40] walk through the world without God in
[54:41] your life and you didn't have any faith
[54:43] you just you just you know they bring
[54:46] out these shows about zombies that's
[54:48] just about right it's a flesh body with
[54:51] nothing in it but before faith came we
[54:56] were kept under the law shut up cuz in
[55:01] the law you nobody had salvation it's
[55:04] why the Old Testament there was no
[55:05] salvation as far as a new birth shut up
[55:10] unto the faith which should afterwards
[55:12] be revealed and then I like to have to
[55:16] be revealed everybody got that saying
[55:19] man now let's go to the next one the
[55:24] seeds not air with a shot here the seed
[55:29] not one one seed not seeds but one seed
[55:33] these others were not seed of Abraham
[55:36] because Abraham's seed was his faith
[55:40] seed that God was speaking of not his
[55:43] natural seed because after Sarah died
[55:46] Abraham made another woman has 7 sons
[55:48] besides daughters so it wouldn't be
[55:50] Abraham seed it was Abraham's capital
[55:53] SPD 1 and that was Abraham's faith seed
[55:58] pointing to the royal seed that was to
[56:01] come through Abraham's faith not
[56:04] Abraham's first life or natural life but
[56:07] Abraham's spiritual life who took
[56:10] everything contrary to God and called it
[56:12] as those it was not and believed God
[56:14] against hope believed in hope that the
[56:15] real seed that that's the real seed that
[56:19] we're speaking of even you can say
[56:23] Abraham's seed didn't do any good
[56:25] natural even Isaac you know Isaac done
[56:30] the same thing his daddy did he give his
[56:33] life away everybody's got a little
[56:35] rascal like brother Brown said they all
[56:36] got a little hair in the biskits
[56:37] somewhere you know so so our first wife
[56:45] was not born by faith but by law let's
[56:47] get back to that for just a second now
[56:48] look Hebrews 10:1 explains every better
[56:53] watch for the law having a shadow of
[56:57] good things to come now remember a
[56:59] shadow has to have light somewhere to
[57:02] produce a shadow so there was light
[57:05] coming from what the eternal the shadow
[57:09] is us down here amen for the law having
[57:13] a shadow of good things to come and not
[57:15] the very image of the things so I said
[57:19] last Sunday or Sunday before laughs God
[57:22] didn't take a picture you when you were
[57:23] a human eighteen or twenty year old
[57:25] person that picture is preserved before
[57:28] the foundation of the world in God's
[57:30] mind that theophanies what you look like
[57:32] but remember like we've talked about
[57:35] last night I ready to close brother man
[57:38] said God bred this one to this one to
[57:40] this one to this one to this one to this
[57:42] one to get you here God's got control
[57:46] over better for the law having a shadow
[57:49] of good things to come you think about
[57:51] it you go back in your life and think
[57:53] how you got here your first life now
[57:57] look you can't deny your first life
[57:59] it brought you here but your second life
[58:03] is the whole situation you need to be in
[58:06] now because once we talk about
[58:07] incorruptible seed everything is by
[58:10] faith everything we do how many have you
[58:12] seen Jesus Christ down across let me
[58:18] help you so it stripes how many of you
[58:20] saw Paul Peter there's only few of you
[58:26] when I say william branham you hold your
[58:28] hand up brother how one maybe joyce i
[58:31] mean how you know these people existed
[58:33] we have faith we are the faith seed of
[58:37] abraham because what abraham abraham
[58:39] believed God before the baby got here
[58:42] that's our problem we have a problem
[58:44] with our faith our faith is as if God
[58:46] will do this I believe if God will heal
[58:52] me I believe he's a healer that's not
[58:55] the way it's supposed to be our faith is
[58:59] that we believe now and look and see the
[59:02] results because remember signs follow
[59:04] the believers all right but then look it
[59:07] says before the new birth or the new
[59:11] life
[59:12] we were not faith based people we just
[59:14] were not I want you to think back think
[59:16] about yeah you're denying you're denying
[59:21] something if you deny that you were just
[59:23] you were here you just exist if we were
[59:25] looking in the we were down in the
[59:29] airport and you just see thousands of
[59:31] people and they just won't buy with no
[59:34] purpose Bible says brute beefs made for
[59:37] destruction brother Graham called them
[59:39] cannon fodder cuz you know what one day
[59:41] if you're not born again today I'm gonna
[59:43] look y'all in the face if you're not
[59:44] born again today you're going out of
[59:47] existence one day you're not an eternal
[59:50] person you have no attribute of God you
[59:54] are going down I don't wanna say hell
[59:56] hell ain't enough for us to just go out
[1:00:00] of existence so that's exactly what's
[1:00:03] going to happen if you're not born again
[1:00:05] that knew that first life you had is got
[1:00:08] to what end
[1:00:12] but the new life never had a beginning
[1:00:16] or had an end so when you raise up into
[1:00:19] that new life we're gonna talk about
[1:00:20] incorruptible seed right here
[1:00:22] when you raise back up into that new
[1:00:23] life I never had the beginning I never
[1:00:27] had an end and remember corruptible
[1:00:31] corruption stinks just put it on the
[1:00:36] bottom
[1:00:36] corruption stinks you see little animal
[1:00:40] inside the road all blowed up he's
[1:00:41] corruption he stinks you and I first
[1:00:45] life to God
[1:00:46] stinks amen but we must come though we
[1:00:50] weren't left in this condition let's
[1:00:54] read first Corinthians 15 now will talk
[1:00:56] about the incorruptible seed or the
[1:00:59] faith see because like I said how many
[1:01:02] of you knew Christ died nobody saw it
[1:01:05] we're just reading words from a history
[1:01:07] book right
[1:01:12] just good fairy tales unless we realize
[1:01:16] there was a real Abraham and the only
[1:01:19] way I said to some hundred times on one
[1:01:21] side 101 you must have like brother Dale
[1:01:24] said you got to be part of the thinker
[1:01:25] if you don't have that part
[1:01:26] you can't understand God's Word if you
[1:01:28] not if you don't have the one that wrote
[1:01:30] it inside of you interpreting it for you
[1:01:34] you can't yeah you can read it no this
[1:01:37] is great but like we were talking about
[1:01:38] last night you can know all mysteries
[1:01:41] all mysteries and not be born again
[1:01:44] that's what paul says you know all
[1:01:47] mysteries but once the one that wrote
[1:01:50] the Bible steps inside of your heart and
[1:01:54] you look through your human eyes and you
[1:01:57] see things that you've never seen before
[1:02:01] that's not Satan giving you a revelation
[1:02:03] I'll promise you that amen Satan had
[1:02:07] rather you stay in your first life
[1:02:10] because you know what that's where he's
[1:02:12] at he can't touch that new birth he can
[1:02:16] he cannot touch incorruptible seed
[1:02:19] because that's the Word of God first
[1:02:23] Corinthians 15 watts and
[1:02:24] as we have borne the image of the earthy
[1:02:26] right now first life we shall also bear
[1:02:29] the image of the heavenly now this I say
[1:02:33] brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[1:02:36] inherit the kingdom of God neither doth
[1:02:39] corruption inherit incorruption so there
[1:02:43] has to be a dividing line or a
[1:02:45] separation line between this life and
[1:02:48] the new life amen behold I show you a
[1:02:52] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[1:02:54] shall be changed in a wool moment in the
[1:02:57] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[1:02:59] for the trumpet shall sound the dead
[1:03:01] shall be raised incorruptible there was
[1:03:06] a brother in their church and brother
[1:03:09] Clark church that he's right about 80
[1:03:11] something years old any way pulled out
[1:03:13] in front of somebody got killed and he
[1:03:16] had to lived a real rough life I said
[1:03:19] bro Clark will never see that again he's
[1:03:22] a born-again Christian I believe I said
[1:03:24] we'll never see that corruption anymore
[1:03:26] brother Tatum will never see brother
[1:03:28] Tatum he won't walk in the door most of
[1:03:31] you that knew him he won't walk in the
[1:03:33] door like this we that is what that's
[1:03:37] false and you know what when they come
[1:03:40] walking through that door or through the
[1:03:42] wall whichever one they won't do that is
[1:03:45] what God saw we're going to see the
[1:03:48] absolute mind of God revealed in human
[1:03:53] flesh again but not with the corruption
[1:03:57] remember the Bible says to me what we
[1:03:59] plant them in corruption but we raised
[1:04:01] them in in corruption I will never see
[1:04:04] those you know even operation you have a
[1:04:08] scar you don't have that scar you're not
[1:04:13] gonna have that errand you're not know
[1:04:16] what you gonna take out with you I don't
[1:04:18] think so you know why because it's not
[1:04:21] so that's part of that first life and
[1:04:24] then this new life does what it makes
[1:04:27] you a new creation God has created
[1:04:32] something boy if you'd see it please
[1:04:36] no tattoos you got that right for this
[1:04:39] corruption must put on incorruption and
[1:04:43] this mortal must put on immortality so
[1:04:48] when there's no watch this is he's
[1:04:49] telling you some izing the whole thing
[1:04:51] so when this corruption shall have put
[1:04:53] on incorruption and this mortal shall
[1:04:55] put on immortality then shall be brought
[1:04:58] to pass the saying that is blank screen
[1:05:00] yeah boo devil death is swallowed up in
[1:05:07] victory man you are a product of death
[1:05:11] your first life your product of death
[1:05:15] but somebody is gonna see that they're
[1:05:19] already immortal those Jimmy Pinkston
[1:05:24] out I didn't tell you that brother Jimmy
[1:05:25] thinks and did a wonderful job Wednesday
[1:05:27] night we were there talking about
[1:05:29] immortality brother branham tells us
[1:05:31] we're already immortal you're already
[1:05:35] more do you see the immortal means that
[1:05:37] this you're leaning towards your first
[1:05:43] life again you're not having faith
[1:05:46] you're living off of your first life
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] then shall pass the saying that is
[1:05:52] written death is swallowed up in victory
[1:05:56] that all rights amen first Peter 1 verse
[1:05:59] 23 back to again being born again not of
[1:06:03] corruptible seed but of incorruptible
[1:06:05] see how by the Word of God which liveth
[1:06:09] and abideth forever
[1:06:10] Genesis 1:26 men is that incorruptible
[1:06:14] seed that's why I love it so much that's
[1:06:16] why if you want to have somebody to look
[1:06:18] to look to that look to that man
[1:06:25] Matthew 13 verse 24 another parable put
[1:06:30] he forth I want you to see this for a
[1:06:31] second another parable he put forth unto
[1:06:33] them saying the kingdom of heaven is
[1:06:35] likened to a man which saw good seed in
[1:06:37] his field
[1:06:38] now remember look the good seed was sown
[1:06:41] first
[1:06:45] before the foundation of the world the
[1:06:49] good seed was sown first he made sure
[1:06:51] the good seed got in the ground then
[1:06:55] we're gonna look at your first life is
[1:06:57] going to come up here in a minute while
[1:06:59] men slept his enemy came in and sowed
[1:07:02] tares among the wheat and went his way
[1:07:05] but when the blades were sprung up and
[1:07:08] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[1:07:10] tares also because remember our first
[1:07:14] life in second life are still together I
[1:07:18] mean even though we say the life which I
[1:07:20] now live I live
[1:07:21] we still live a human first life but
[1:07:25] remember it's got to be so dead that you
[1:07:28] don't yield to it you don't yield to
[1:07:30] that life all right so the servant of
[1:07:32] the household came and sent her sir
[1:07:34] that's not down so good seed in thy
[1:07:36] field from whence has the tares in other
[1:07:38] words were the tears come from he said
[1:07:40] unto them an enemy hath done this but
[1:07:43] watch the servant said unto Him wilt
[1:07:47] thou then that we go and gather them up
[1:07:49] but he said nay lest while you gather up
[1:07:53] the first life you root up what the good
[1:07:58] life so you got in other words you got
[1:08:01] to live your course here's my point if
[1:08:03] God knows everything knows where you
[1:08:05] going to be knows that your birth is
[1:08:07] what it is knows that you going to
[1:08:09] heaven why didn't he just when he said
[1:08:11] I'll put enmity why didn't he just do
[1:08:13] away with all that and just put us in
[1:08:14] the future home because we had to make
[1:08:18] herself manifest the good tears had to
[1:08:23] make their self manifest from the bad
[1:08:25] tears are from the from the wheat from
[1:08:27] the tares here udall sew up the wheat
[1:08:30] with them let both in other words let
[1:08:33] both go through seven church ages until
[1:08:37] the harvest now when is the harvest now
[1:08:41] the harvest is now and in the time of
[1:08:45] harvest I will say to the preachers that
[1:08:50] is in the Bible reapers or preachers
[1:08:53] gather ye together first the tares in
[1:08:56] other words what bind the first law
[1:08:59] that's my that's what mine brother Dale
[1:09:01] brother Aaron brother Lewis all the
[1:09:03] other brothers we are trying to bind
[1:09:05] that tear of your life we're trying to
[1:09:08] bind those tears that are bothering you
[1:09:12] and bind them in bundles to burn them
[1:09:18] leather the wheat into my barn God is
[1:09:22] going his barn is heaven I don't care
[1:09:25] you can call a barn and what you want to
[1:09:26] but God just called heaven a barn all
[1:09:29] right that's all right
[1:09:30] that both grow together until the
[1:09:33] harvest in the time of harvest I will
[1:09:35] say to the Reapers
[1:09:36] what's the Reapers they go out and
[1:09:39] physically do the work their laborers
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:44] preachers anybody that helps you in the
[1:09:47] Word of God you're binding the tares and
[1:09:50] you're gathering the wheat what you're
[1:09:52] separating the old life from the new
[1:09:54] life the life that I now live pulpit
[1:09:58] amen all right so now let's go to first
[1:10:01] Peter 1 back again let's be the God and
[1:10:06] father of our Lord Jesus Christ which
[1:10:08] according to his abundant mercy has
[1:10:09] begotten us again unto a lively hope by
[1:10:12] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:10:14] the dead to an inheritance incorruptible
[1:10:18] and undefiled and fadeth not away
[1:10:24] reserved in heaven for you so there's
[1:10:28] got to be a heavenly quality to this
[1:10:31] incorruptible seed but it says reserved
[1:10:35] in heaven for you before the foundation
[1:10:39] of the world now watch let's read what
[1:10:41] we've been reading in adoption series
[1:10:47] next quote lookup Jeffrey inheritance by
[1:10:53] predestination I inherited something
[1:10:55] what inheritance there had to be
[1:10:56] somebody leave me an inheritance now
[1:11:00] remember Jesus didn't leave you an
[1:11:01] inheritance you got to go away Pais back
[1:11:06] before that Jesus left you an
[1:11:09] inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never
[1:11:12] left me in
[1:11:13] inheritance and he never left you an
[1:11:14] inheritance he only came down and paid
[1:11:18] for your inheritance brought you to your
[1:11:22] inheritance got you out of the pawn shop
[1:11:25] another word but your name was put on
[1:11:31] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:11:33] foundation of the world God give you
[1:11:36] your inheritance your inheritance
[1:11:40] was first incorruptible but we had to
[1:11:45] drop down into corruption because of the
[1:11:47] fall because of the curse because Jesus
[1:11:50] wouldn't have been a savior he wouldn't
[1:11:51] have done this if we had to fail but our
[1:11:54] inheritance never was marred our
[1:11:58] inheritance never was forgotten our
[1:12:00] inheritance never was out of the mind of
[1:12:03] God he stays constant remember his
[1:12:08] thoughts are eternal now if he thought
[1:12:11] of you dying you can't change that he
[1:12:15] thought of you as the Son of God you
[1:12:17] can't change that Wow pretty good huh he
[1:12:22] chose you paragraph 178 let's go down
[1:12:28] didn't Paul say five verses God by
[1:12:31] foreknowledge seen exactly who would be
[1:12:33] saved and who wouldn't be saying he sent
[1:12:35] Jesus to save those that he had already
[1:12:37] chosen and he refers back to the
[1:12:40] scripture brother Dale has been reading
[1:12:41] five verses behind this that he chose us
[1:12:43] in him before there was even a world
[1:12:45] that's our inheritance God chose us and
[1:12:50] let Jesus come and pay the price the
[1:12:52] what he's shedding of his blood that no
[1:12:54] sin would be accounted to us that's our
[1:12:57] inheritance our inheritance there's no
[1:13:00] sin nothing you do now let's read this
[1:13:10] long quote we'll be finished
[1:13:11] I love this so we're gonna read it on
[1:13:13] some earning Church age now the church
[1:13:17] age but listen watch our brother branham
[1:13:20] brings us all down and puts it all to me
[1:13:22] this is the conclusion
[1:13:26] all right this is the conclusion of what
[1:13:28] we've been for seven or eight services
[1:13:30] brother Brown said in John 6:37 and 44
[1:13:34] it says all that the father giveth me
[1:13:36] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:13:39] me I'm shall in no wise cast out no man
[1:13:42] can come to me except the father draw
[1:13:44] him and I will raise him up at the last
[1:13:47] day what a promise John 1:12 2:13 but as
[1:13:50] many as received him to them gave he
[1:13:53] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:13:57] them that believe on his name which were
[1:13:59] born look not of blood that's your
[1:14:02] corruptible seed amen nor of the will of
[1:14:07] the flesh nor of the will of man but of
[1:14:12] God
[1:14:13] Ephesians 1:4 2:5 according as he has
[1:14:16] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:14:18] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:14:19] without blame before him in love look
[1:14:21] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:14:23] the white sheet the white sheet this is
[1:14:27] what this is blame Satan writes all this
[1:14:30] down you know he's this brother Gary
[1:14:32] mine won't fit on this one page but I'm
[1:14:35] just gonna say this is mine sin but when
[1:14:37] God gets finished writing it that's what
[1:14:40] it looks like a man having predestinated
[1:14:42] us into the adoption of children by
[1:14:45] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:14:48] good pleasure of his will and what is
[1:14:49] his will his will is his word we are
[1:14:52] today because our father died we are now
[1:14:57] listening to the will that he left us
[1:15:06] I'll let that sink in for a minute he's
[1:15:11] always my inheritance you got to come to
[1:15:15] the reading of the will to get your
[1:15:18] inheritance and I didn't go to brother
[1:15:21] Donny's brother Tom loved me like a son
[1:15:23] but my name wasn't in the wheel was it
[1:15:26] why wasn't my name in the wheel that
[1:15:29] were Susan she stole my red truck anyway
[1:15:34] why wasn't I in your will oh what Oh
[1:15:38] what no in his family I wasn't in his
[1:15:43] family
[1:15:44] I had another family name same way with
[1:15:47] God you'd be sitting here today and
[1:15:49] you're not born again you couldn't give
[1:15:50] a care if you actually want me to hurt
[1:15:52] him finish but for the ones that what
[1:15:56] are in the family this is my inheritance
[1:16:01] and the reading of the will or the word
[1:16:04] is where I'm going to get my inheritance
[1:16:09] amen
[1:16:10] what brother out his will is his word so
[1:16:15] it's the reading of the will I like that
[1:16:17] statement where there's a will there's a
[1:16:19] way
[1:16:20] brother how where there's a will there's
[1:16:25] a way to get back to it
[1:16:26] amen all right now without getting too
[1:16:29] involved in the subject this is brother
[1:16:30] Branham of the sovereignty of God for
[1:16:32] that we'll take a book in itself let me
[1:16:34] point out here that according to these
[1:16:36] verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own
[1:16:38] bride just the same as men choose their
[1:16:41] bride today now he's living in the 1960s
[1:16:44] because that don't happen in the 2000
[1:16:46] women are picking their own husbands now
[1:16:49] I said husbands I didn't say one hey the
[1:16:53] Bible says seven women will take hold of
[1:16:54] one man right Jesus I could say
[1:17:01] something I'm not Jesus Christ is
[1:17:02] choosing his own bride just the same as
[1:17:05] men choose their Brides today the bride
[1:17:07] today does not simply decide she is
[1:17:10] going to take a certain man for a
[1:17:12] husband no sir it is the groom who
[1:17:15] decides and chooses a certain woman for
[1:17:18] his bride John 15:16 you have not chosen
[1:17:21] me but I have chosen you now according
[1:17:24] to the Word of God the bride was chosen
[1:17:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:29] that's what we've been preaching on for
[1:17:30] months this choosing of the bride was
[1:17:33] purposed in himself Ephesians 1 verse 9
[1:17:36] now in Romans 9 11 it says that the
[1:17:39] purpose of God according to election
[1:17:40] might stand you cannot read it any other
[1:17:44] way
[1:17:44] listen the heart purpose the eternal
[1:17:48] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[1:17:51] his own choosing because she's got the
[1:17:55] right character she's got the right
[1:17:59] attribute and she's in the right family
[1:18:03] God is not going to marry Satan's bride
[1:18:07] because she is out of character she's
[1:18:10] had many husbands Oh Baptist Methodist
[1:18:15] Pentecostal what everyone's saying
[1:18:17] randomise and that purpose was in
[1:18:20] himself and being eternal was decreed
[1:18:24] before the foundation of the world watch
[1:18:26] carefully now and see this before there
[1:18:28] ever was a speck of Stardust before God
[1:18:31] was God
[1:18:32] now how many theologians were sitting
[1:18:34] there that day of course we know that's
[1:18:35] the church age book but he did preach
[1:18:37] that sermon they got their going what in
[1:18:39] the world God is an object of worship
[1:18:41] and no one was there to worship him so
[1:18:43] he was at that time only potentially God
[1:18:46] only a prophet can say that and he was
[1:18:50] known only as Eternal Spirit the bride
[1:18:53] was already in his mind in other words
[1:18:57] he wasn't sitting there idle he had a
[1:18:59] plan and a purpose
[1:19:01] amen she was existing in his thoughts
[1:19:05] and what about those thoughts of God
[1:19:09] they are eternal are they not the
[1:19:14] eternal thoughts of God let me ask you
[1:19:17] are the thoughts of God eternal if you
[1:19:19] can see this you will see many things
[1:19:22] that's why we've been on it for so long
[1:19:23] God is unchangeable in both essence and
[1:19:27] behavior we have studied that improving
[1:19:30] that already God is infinite in his
[1:19:32] abilities so therefore he has God must
[1:19:35] be omniscient he is omniscient then he
[1:19:38] is not learning or is he taking counsel
[1:19:41] even with himself how many times we talk
[1:19:45] to herself right God don't talk to
[1:19:47] herself
[1:19:48] he is itself his first thought is the
[1:19:52] right one so he don't have to make
[1:19:53] another one he don't have to confer all
[1:19:56] right if he can add to his knowledge
[1:19:59] then he's not omniscient
[1:20:01] the best we can say is sometimes he will
[1:20:03] be but that is not scriptural he is
[1:20:06] omniscient now watch this he has never
[1:20:08] had a new thought about anything because
[1:20:10] all the stops he always had and always
[1:20:13] will have knows the end from the
[1:20:15] beginning because he is God
[1:20:17] thus the thoughts of God are eternal and
[1:20:20] they are real see we can formulate
[1:20:25] things in our human mind that never
[1:20:26] comes to pass about ninety nine point
[1:20:30] eight nine percent of the time right but
[1:20:35] God his 100 percent of his thoughts
[1:20:37] always come to pass I always come to
[1:20:40] pass they are real they are not simply
[1:20:45] like a man with a blueprint he has drawn
[1:20:47] up in which one day will be translated
[1:20:50] into substance and form listen but they
[1:20:53] are already real and eternal and part of
[1:20:57] God my brother Dale said this morning
[1:20:59] brother Branham was correct your soul
[1:21:01] God God created your soul before the man
[1:21:03] I tomorrow right there it is he can't I
[1:21:08] listen people I'm telling you I told
[1:21:12] them last night we are making ourselves
[1:21:14] a second person of the Trinity and don't
[1:21:16] know it yes we are because we're not to
[1:21:23] the point where we can say we are God
[1:21:25] yeah we can say where God made manifest
[1:21:26] in another form everybody goes I love
[1:21:28] you but do we really believe that do we
[1:21:31] really believe that no not till we go
[1:21:35] toward that headstone right there will
[1:21:36] we ever know that because remember they
[1:21:39] wasn't a day that Jesus thought he was
[1:21:41] the devil amen and if we have the mind
[1:21:46] of Christ which are the same thoughts
[1:21:48] remember his thoughts are eternal so he
[1:21:50] can't have a new thought the same
[1:21:52] thoughts are going there in his mind is
[1:21:54] going to be transferred to you and I and
[1:21:56] it's not the thought transferred to this
[1:21:58] one and then somebody else speaks it and
[1:22:01] it's that person's thought to the degree
[1:22:03] that the first life do you understand
[1:22:05] that but we must beat the mind of Christ
[1:22:08] he's going to use a group of people to
[1:22:11] speak through
[1:22:13] and that get well I'm getting too far
[1:22:16] ahead see how this works
[1:22:18] God always had it start for Adam Adam as
[1:22:20] his thoughts was yet unexpressed Psalms
[1:22:23] 139 15 we read this the other day we'll
[1:22:25] give you a little idea of this my
[1:22:27] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:22:29] was made in secret and curiously wrought
[1:22:31] in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:22:33] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[1:22:35] being unperfect and in the book where
[1:22:38] all my members written which in
[1:22:40] continuance were fashioned in other
[1:22:42] words birth one birth everybody birth
[1:22:44] when as yet there was none of them that
[1:22:48] as I said was not written about Adam but
[1:22:51] it gives you the idea and knowledge that
[1:22:54] the thought was there in his mind and
[1:22:56] that thought was eternal and had to be
[1:23:00] expressed so then so when Adam was
[1:23:03] formed the dust of the earth and his
[1:23:05] spiritual being created by God then Adam
[1:23:07] became God's thought expressed and those
[1:23:11] eternal thoughts were now manifested
[1:23:13] down through the centuries we could go
[1:23:17] we find the Moses Jeremiah John the
[1:23:18] Baptist each one of these were God's
[1:23:20] eternal thought expressed in its season
[1:23:22] then we come to Jesus the logos he was
[1:23:26] the perfect and complete thought
[1:23:28] expressed and he became known as the
[1:23:31] word that is what he is and forever will
[1:23:35] be now to sum it all up now it says that
[1:23:41] he has chosen us in him Jesus before the
[1:23:44] foundation of the world that means that
[1:23:47] we were right there with him in the mind
[1:23:50] and thoughts of God before the
[1:23:52] foundation of the world that gives an
[1:23:54] eternal quality to the elect you cannot
[1:23:58] get away from that that gives an eternal
[1:24:01] quality to a group of people like I said
[1:24:03] back in the scripture before in the end
[1:24:05] time is the only time that is going to
[1:24:08] be revealed who we really are
[1:24:10] hey man I was telling somebody in the
[1:24:16] back and we'll do a little sermon Allah
[1:24:18] Jesus tells a parable and he's - he has
[1:24:21] a man that goes out and he says occupy
[1:24:23] till I come
[1:24:26] Moses occupy
[1:24:27] at a time on earth until Christ came and
[1:24:30] moved to another dispensation now he's
[1:24:33] moved through Methodists Baptists he's
[1:24:34] moved through First Church days all the
[1:24:36] way through he has had his people but
[1:24:38] listen there's no other dispensation we
[1:24:40] go into there's no other prophet to
[1:24:43] bring us something else there's no other
[1:24:45] us going into the ground and somebody
[1:24:47] raising back up this is the only group
[1:24:49] that is not that it's not that is
[1:24:51] worried about going down Pol Pot was
[1:24:56] telling the people look there's got to
[1:24:58] be other church ages in other words
[1:24:59] there's got to be other group of people
[1:25:00] we're gonna die we which are alive and
[1:25:04] remain he just become the other part
[1:25:05] amen so we come through now we see
[1:25:08] though that the eternal quality
[1:25:10] silhouette is only in this endtime in
[1:25:15] other words we have heard from our
[1:25:17] theophany which is the Word of God you
[1:25:20] say well it's the body somewhere it's
[1:25:22] the word it's the word and then the word
[1:25:25] was made flesh the word is what we're
[1:25:29] dealing with today we have all the Bible
[1:25:32] and we have all the quotes and we have
[1:25:35] wonderful preachers that preach sermons
[1:25:37] you've never had this much information
[1:25:40] ever even when Jesus was here he was
[1:25:44] only speaking to a certain group of
[1:25:45] people but he was prophesying of a group
[1:25:48] to come and then Paul was prophesying of
[1:25:52] a group to come even Martin Luther knew
[1:25:54] he couldn't complete everything so he's
[1:25:57] prophesying of a group to come because
[1:25:59] the Justice got to live by faith first
[1:26:01] because I just told you remember we
[1:26:04] don't live by faith if you're not born
[1:26:05] again you live by works you live I do
[1:26:08] and don't in law and this and that and
[1:26:10] the other amen you know they make laws
[1:26:14] for anybody that runs over you know 75
[1:26:20] miles an hour on speed only thing they
[1:26:23] make laws that if anybody runs over 70
[1:26:25] miles an hour you can be stopped and you
[1:26:27] can be fined right hey ma'am right
[1:26:32] severe penalties Robbie will get you
[1:26:37] I saw you sitting there before what
[1:26:42] they'll do like they do as they sit
[1:26:44] there at our store Denis they you know
[1:26:46] they sit there with that gun and they go
[1:26:49] but you know what if you never run over
[1:26:52] the speed limit listen if you never run
[1:26:56] over the speed limit that law is not in
[1:26:58] existence it is not in existence you say
[1:27:02] I've read all them I've read all them
[1:27:04] drinking and driving laws I know them
[1:27:06] drinking travelers rubbing to rout them
[1:27:09] drinking and rhino then drinking drive
[1:27:10] Lowe's upside down why why if you never
[1:27:16] drink and drive that low doesn't exist
[1:27:21] what am I telling you stay in the mind
[1:27:23] of God
[1:27:24] stay in the word of God if you get
[1:27:27] outside the Word of God there's
[1:27:28] penalties but if you stay inside the
[1:27:31] word of god there's promises and then so
[1:27:34] live inside the Word of God if we
[1:27:36] brother Ram said if we do something
[1:27:38] wrong what we go out in other words we
[1:27:40] runs 85 instead of 70 and we get caught
[1:27:45] when we go oops
[1:27:46] well you know the UPS is okay but if you
[1:27:49] get somebody like Robbie or me
[1:27:51] you'd get one chance and that was
[1:27:52] already done I'm gonna write you a
[1:27:54] ticket right Robbie Moe right yet yep I
[1:27:59] knew you would so this first life is
[1:28:05] under the law this whole first life is
[1:28:08] not even supposed to be here it is not
[1:28:10] it we are contrary to God as soon as
[1:28:13] we're born no I'm sorry we're contrary
[1:28:16] to God as soon as we're conceived
[1:28:18] because there should be no conception
[1:28:21] like that that's right now it's allowed
[1:28:25] to get us here but it never was God's
[1:28:28] perfect plan but now that we are here
[1:28:34] though Jesus never come to bring you
[1:28:37] that inheritance that inheritance has
[1:28:40] been on the books since the foundation
[1:28:41] of the world he just made a way for us
[1:28:44] to what get out of this that we're in
[1:28:46] and go to that law from the I mean from
[1:28:50] the law
[1:28:50] - that word of God and you know why you
[1:28:55] know why we won't need Bibles brother
[1:28:56] Larry you know why we won't need this
[1:28:57] Bible we're not going all of us in be in
[1:29:00] the city doing this carry a lot brother
[1:29:03] Brennan why we're gonna be the Living
[1:29:07] Bible we're gonna be the Living Bible
[1:29:10] made manifest
[1:29:11] we will not they will not have to go
[1:29:13] it's somebody outside the city we were
[1:29:15] talking about this in Oklahoma somebody
[1:29:17] outside the city is gonna come up and
[1:29:18] say tell me about whatever you're gonna
[1:29:23] have to wait a minute guy go to library
[1:29:25] let me Google will not be in the future
[1:29:29] home you will be Google because somebody
[1:29:34] will ask you a question and guess what
[1:29:36] you'll know the answer God doesn't have
[1:29:38] to scratch his head and wonder what the
[1:29:41] answer no if the man already knows what
[1:29:44] you're gonna ask him he's gonna have the
[1:29:48] answer already waiting remember what God
[1:29:50] said he said before you even think it
[1:29:53] what a daddy before you even think it
[1:29:56] I've already got your answer why because
[1:29:58] he he heard you think it before the
[1:30:00] foundation of the world he had this all
[1:30:03] laid out listen why do we fight
[1:30:04] listening why do we fight
[1:30:08] we always fight this first life because
[1:30:11] it's not a faith but once you get born
[1:30:13] again there's a fight remember what Paul
[1:30:15] said Paul said there's a warring in my
[1:30:18] members the thing I would not I do now
[1:30:20] listen
[1:30:20] he wasn't warring with that so much when
[1:30:23] he was taking him Christians and putting
[1:30:24] him in jail he was just doing what the
[1:30:27] law said he was doing what what his
[1:30:30] denomination told him to do right but
[1:30:34] when he got knocked off that horse he
[1:30:38] had to go there nice and nice pray for
[1:30:42] him to get the holy go I've always
[1:30:44] wondered with he already had a seat any
[1:30:46] wine and just quick and while God was
[1:30:47] talking to you really I mean there was
[1:30:51] God Lord people listen the pure plan of
[1:30:59] salvation is we were lost but there was
[1:31:02] a part of us not that part that you
[1:31:04] daddy bro none of it that your mom and
[1:31:08] daddy brought but there was a part of us
[1:31:09] that was sealed up in his will but
[1:31:14] remember he had to die to release now
[1:31:18] we're not going tomorrow man Terrence
[1:31:20] and Anna's not going tomorrow to the
[1:31:22] lawyer and read mom and dad's will
[1:31:24] why they're not dead right there must be
[1:31:30] the death of a testator there must be a
[1:31:32] death of the family member before a will
[1:31:35] can be read so the will can be read our
[1:31:39] crisis already died in this life Christ
[1:31:43] has already died so everything that was
[1:31:46] ours
[1:31:47] he didn't bring it to us it was already
[1:31:49] there he just made a way of dying that
[1:31:53] the will can be read back to the
[1:31:56] children for an inheritance
[1:31:58] incorruptible let's power here Heavenly
[1:32:03] Father we pray Lord that we've come to
[1:32:06] the conclusion of this and we see that
[1:32:10] truly Paul was looking in a mirror and
[1:32:14] looking at the past things that he had
[1:32:16] done to all those Christians and he said
[1:32:18] the life that I now live I live by the
[1:32:21] faith of the Son of God
[1:32:24] I don't live by myself anymore but
[1:32:29] Christ liveth in me
[1:32:31] and we see Lord that we've come now to
[1:32:34] the end of time where we understand
[1:32:38] these things
[1:32:39] and we're able to literally as Adam did
[1:32:44] in the garden shunned the devil and
[1:32:47] telling me has no part but father when
[1:32:51] we get to heaven when we get to that
[1:32:53] future home the Bible says there'll be
[1:32:56] no whoremongers there'll be no liars
[1:32:58] there'll be no thieves there'll be no
[1:33:00] murders and none of those will be in
[1:33:02] that city it'll only be the pure
[1:33:05] redeemed that come from this new life
[1:33:09] Paul spoke it better he says a new
[1:33:11] creation a new creature
[1:33:14] lord I pray that from this day forward
[1:33:16] that will live more
[1:33:18] that creature that new creation that new
[1:33:23] life not the first life but the new life
[1:33:26] that will yield to it so much that death
[1:33:29] will be destroyed because we know if we
[1:33:30] lean toward that first life that we are
[1:33:32] going to pass away but Lord you told us
[1:33:37] through a little prophet that this end
[1:33:40] time was the time of the resurrection
[1:33:45] and change of the body so we put our
[1:33:48] faith on that that if it be us
[1:33:50] hallelujah if it not be us hallelujah
[1:33:53] somebody will stand one day and deny
[1:33:57] death they'll miss that appointment
[1:33:59] because it's appointed unto man once to
[1:34:02] die
[1:34:02] well there's brother Jimmy Pinkston with
[1:34:05] saying Wednesday night and I've always
[1:34:07] said for years we'll just miss our
[1:34:09] appointment we have appointed that we've
[1:34:12] been appointed to go you know we've got
[1:34:13] an appointment tomorrow to go to the
[1:34:15] doctor Lord but if we miss that
[1:34:17] appointment then we don't get we don't
[1:34:19] go so we're going to miss that
[1:34:21] appointment somebody's going to miss
[1:34:22] that appointment with death and Lord let
[1:34:25] it be us let it be this church let it be
[1:34:28] the bride that we are given charge over
[1:34:31] Lord that that we as as fellow servants
[1:34:35] with all the other ministers and deacons
[1:34:37] and elders and all in this church Lord
[1:34:38] that will bring all these all these
[1:34:40] things to light and the people can Lord
[1:34:43] live a better life live a good full
[1:34:46] wholesome life in you and Lord I know
[1:34:49] you've blessed all of us in many things
[1:34:51] personally and financially and and and
[1:34:54] everybody in this church but lord I pray
[1:34:56] now that you bless us spiritually give
[1:34:59] us a spiritual blessing Lord that we
[1:35:00] cannot contain may our cup be running so
[1:35:02] far over till they become a river father
[1:35:06] we pray that you just be with us now
[1:35:07] take care of us in the firmament of
[1:35:09] service if there be any sick here Lord
[1:35:11] if they'd raise their hand if it'd be
[1:35:12] anyone sick we're gonna pray now Lord
[1:35:14] and then go straighten in the communion
[1:35:16] because but we believe that communion is
[1:35:17] very important but we pray in the name
[1:35:19] of Jesus Christ if anybody has a need
[1:35:21] here in the building Lord that you would
[1:35:23] take care of that need now may they
[1:35:25] believe right in their seat let's do it
[1:35:27] the Gentile way let's do it the way that
[1:35:29] where we just speak the word
[1:35:32] and let it be done we believe these
[1:35:35] things we believe what we spoke Lord we
[1:35:38] believe Lord that you've come among us
[1:35:41] and now it's our turn to give back to
[1:35:46] you Father
[1:35:46] take the word back to you but let it be
[1:35:49] made alive in our life probably give us
[1:35:52] today our daily bread and forgive us of
[1:35:53] our sins Lord in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:35:56] amen
[1:35:58] let's go into the communion believe it
[1:36:14] right believe in that word the ones that
[1:36:18] we are or the prophets say when the
[1:36:24] bride realizes who she is and what she's
[1:36:27] here for
[1:36:28] she'll be an invincible army Satan is
[1:36:33] already defeated but he'll find out it
[1:36:36] it's a right time so let's just go into
[1:36:41] the communion I'm reading from the
[1:36:44] scriptures and Corinthians says I have
[1:36:46] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:36:49] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:36:52] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:36:54] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:36:56] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:37:00] body which is broken for you this doing
[1:37:02] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:37:05] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:37:08] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:37:11] my blood this do ye as oft as you drink
[1:37:14] it in remembrance of me
[1:37:16] where as often as you eat this bread and
[1:37:18] drink this cup you just use the Lord's
[1:37:21] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:37:23] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:37:25] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:37:28] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:37:31] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:37:33] eat of that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:37:35] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:37:37] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:37:40] not discerning the Lord's body
[1:37:44] but this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:37:45] among you and many sleep burns we would
[1:37:49] judge ourselves should we should not be
[1:37:51] judged now I love this even if we don't
[1:37:55] do it he'll judge us you'd have to be
[1:37:58] right but when we are judged we are
[1:38:02] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:38:05] be condemned with the world what a
[1:38:06] wonderful time he chastens us keep us
[1:38:09] from being condemned hmm wherefore my
[1:38:13] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:38:14] tarry one for another if any man hungry
[1:38:18] let him eat at home
[1:38:19] if you come not together under
[1:38:21] condemnation the rest will I said in
[1:38:24] order when I come let's just have a few
[1:38:27] moments of silent prayer reading one for
[1:38:30] another Lord would be with each one of
[1:38:32] us
[1:38:47] father we thank you for the word that we
[1:38:50] just heard we believe it and we thank
[1:38:52] you for the ability to be able to
[1:38:54] believe in order to understand and then
[1:38:58] to know that with that same word it has
[1:39:00] brought forth all these things into us
[1:39:04] and that Lord we understand what the
[1:39:07] communion is we're not like the world
[1:39:10] lost and pondering wondering we know
[1:39:13] what these things mean what it's all
[1:39:16] about we thank you thank you for
[1:39:19] revealing your word into us and guiding
[1:39:21] us and that your loving grace be with us
[1:39:24] in Jesus name
[1:39:34] whether we thank you this bread has been
[1:39:36] made today for this one purpose or what
[1:39:41] we're fixing to do Lord then is we burn
[1:39:44] what's left so we don't try to hold it
[1:39:47] over that is all in you we love you we
[1:39:50] thank you
[1:39:51] sanctify the bread and the protectors
[1:39:54] but we know this is not no literal body
[1:39:56] but it represents your body so we thank
[1:40:00] you for all things we think ask you to
[1:40:03] sanctify the bread and the protectors
[1:40:05] together in your love in Jesus name
[1:40:19] what a wonderful art the time to know
[1:40:22] the truth and play the saying this is
[1:40:28] the day right
[1:40:29] I will say that that day you'll know
[1:40:32] that's this day the day of this
[1:40:35] revelation right is coming forward you
[1:40:38] can we can see who we are what's taking
[1:40:42] place in the land today we look out we
[1:40:46] read the newspaper we see what's
[1:40:48] happening in the world we read the
[1:40:51] prophets message the Bible we see what's
[1:40:53] happening in the body right then we we
[1:40:56] know that we're here it's face you know
[1:40:59] how long none of our business
[1:41:02] why did it work about how long we're
[1:41:06] worried about this being ready against
[1:41:08] that day let the truth set us free
[1:41:28] whether we thank you for this wine
[1:41:30] that's been made for this purpose we ask
[1:41:32] you now to just sanctify it and the
[1:41:34] people we know this represents your
[1:41:36] blood that was shed for us it's not
[1:41:38] literal but it's a representation
[1:41:41] somebody as we eat through the piece of
[1:41:43] bread and we drank the wine lower
[1:41:45] tomorrow it'll be turn into parts of our
[1:41:51] body that will help us to grow and we
[1:41:53] thank you for it we love you we ask you
[1:41:56] sanctify the wine and it will take her
[1:41:58] in Jesus name
