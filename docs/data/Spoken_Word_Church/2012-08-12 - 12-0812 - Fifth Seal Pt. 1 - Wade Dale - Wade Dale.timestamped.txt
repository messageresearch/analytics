[0:37] Planes we're the southern states right l
[0:40] i will be with you
[0:42] always he was telling us Southerners
[0:44] he's going to be right here with
[0:47] us mostly because we need
[0:50] it mostly because we need it not just
[0:52] because we're special well we may be
[0:54] special not that kind of
[0:58] special all right now just by way of
[1:01] review just for a few minutes for some
[1:03] of the ones that are that are just
[1:05] starting in the class which is wonderful
[1:07] that's good but we went through seal 1 2
[1:10] 3 and four all right we saw that seal
[1:13] number one we saw an antichrist ride on
[1:17] a white horse but we understand one
[1:19] thing for sure that that white horse
[1:21] rode in the power of the people but
[1:23] there was also a power of the of the
[1:25] almighty God the the true white
[1:29] righteous Church was riding in the first
[1:31] three ages everybody understand right so
[1:34] it wasn't through the seals that Satan
[1:37] was revealed I don't want nothing
[1:38] revealed of this guy I want him
[1:41] exposed for what he is cuz he hid
[1:44] himself in a white righteous church and
[1:46] went riding right through with them God
[1:48] going first Satan couldn't be the
[1:50] original one he can't be an original
[1:52] anything he has to be a copycat all
[1:55] right so he had to ride into the people
[1:59] the people gave him the power and then
[2:01] when the people gave him the
[2:03] power then they went from a saying to a
[2:06] deed to a Doctrine and then to an
[2:08] incarnate pope all right so it started
[2:11] as a little saying it starts as a little
[2:15] saying now we're on the internet
[2:18] sorry it starts with the saying then it
[2:22] becomes a deed in
[2:24] N 606 they brought it into
[2:27] fruition by making it a law and then
[2:29] they crowned a pole so now it's
[2:32] incarnate Satan riding through the
[2:35] church ages so Church age one two and
[2:38] three were in the were parallel with the
[2:40] first seal everybody got that say Amen
[2:43] all right pretty much that's pretty weak
[2:45] but you
[2:46] know say amen amen better all right so
[2:51] now that white righteous Church there
[2:54] was a true church in the first three
[2:56] ages but what happened to them they
[2:58] began to become part of that that white
[3:00] horse rider Antichrist system right and
[3:04] then when that came into an incarnate
[3:06] Pope he began to speak CU it says to
[3:08] give him a sword he began to speak and
[3:10] what did he do he spoke blaspheme
[3:13] Blasphemous names he started back in
[3:15] those ages blaspheming the red horse was
[3:18] because of what killing the people there
[3:21] was 68 million Protestants killed in the
[3:23] fourth Church age so the fourth Church
[3:25] age
[3:27] parallels the second seal all right
[3:29] second seal is a red horse red is always
[3:32] blood all right so as we saw in
[3:34] justification in the first church a or
[3:37] the first seal it was a white righteous
[3:39] Church disguised Satan disguised as a
[3:42] white righteous church right but there
[3:44] was a white righteous church that was
[3:46] truly Justified during that time so the
[3:48] first seal would show justification to a
[3:51] group of people and even show us our
[3:53] justification we weren't back there in
[3:55] the first three ages we're up here in
[3:57] this age but we get all the ages
[3:59] combined
[4:00] so the first seal shows our
[4:02] justification that we are if we're truly
[4:04] Justified we're already glorified if
[4:05] we're truly Justified then what happened
[4:07] God wiped you as white as you'll ever be
[4:10] as far as your sins being gone in the in
[4:12] the past right but the unclean Spirit
[4:15] still there he has to come over into
[4:17] sanctification which is the red red
[4:20] always means blood red always means
[4:22] sanctification all right so it's a
[4:25] killing of your old nature beginning to
[4:27] kill that old nature like I said before
[4:29] make that Stony heart see this is not
[4:32] pliable you can't move this cuz why
[4:34] smash
[4:36] Stone but he said I'll put in a fleshly
[4:40] heart flesh is pliable you can stretch
[4:43] it and pull it and all these things we
[4:44] can tell that by the way we're getting
[4:45] older amen amen the older on say Amen
[4:50] the younger on say I don't know what
[4:51] you're talking
[4:52] about the older one say wait a little
[4:57] while gravity will take over
[5:00] but that's the second seal there was a
[5:02] red horse rode through the fourth Church
[5:04] Age killing 68 million
[5:08] Protestants um that was Columbus age
[5:10] which Columba was from Ireland they have
[5:13] a place over there where his b where he
[5:14] lived right yeah I'm where he's buried
[5:17] and where he's buried okay so dad and
[5:18] him went to see I think Mom and him went
[5:20] to see and Anna and Richard and him they
[5:21] went to see it when they were over there
[5:23] so that was Columba but it was just the
[5:25] spirit of the age was the ox Spirit of
[5:27] the first age was the lion o which was
[5:29] the second age which was a labor all
[5:32] they had to do was claim Jesus Christ
[5:33] you know they didn't know nothing about
[5:34] the seal they didn't know nothing about
[5:36] a lot of things but they knew that Jesus
[5:39] Christ was their Savior and he washed
[5:42] them in his blood they accepted that
[5:44] that became the fourth Church age they
[5:46] live through that age and they died
[5:48] because the Catholic Church proclaimed
[5:50] that if you're not a Catholic you're
[5:52] going to die that's just the way it was
[5:54] you know and it was better for the
[5:56] Catholic Church Catholic Church to kill
[5:57] you during that time they were thinking
[5:59] and they were doing you a service all
[6:01] right knowing that they were actually
[6:03] killing 68 million true Christians
[6:07] during that Dark Ages all right and that
[6:10] was the second seal well the third seal
[6:12] goes in let's just read it right here
[6:13] and when he had opened the third seal
[6:15] cuz we're getting closer to the fifth
[6:16] seal and when he had opened the third
[6:18] seal I heard the third Beast say coming
[6:20] see him beheld a black horse and he that
[6:22] sat on him had a pair balances in his
[6:24] hand and I heard in the midst of the
[6:26] four Beast saying a measure of wheat for
[6:28] a penny and three measures of Marley for
[6:29] offin see that not hurt the oil and
[6:31] white they were coming out of that
[6:32] fourth Church AE and then now the third
[6:36] seal is parallel of the fifth and sixth
[6:38] Church age
[6:41] right class participation I need an
[6:44] amen that's the fifth and sixth Church
[6:46] age that's Luther and Wesley Luther come
[6:49] out and started the protesting of the
[6:53] Catholic Church which made him a
[6:55] Protestant that's why you have
[6:56] Protestants and Catholics they protested
[6:59] and they became known as Protestants
[7:01] because they said hey the Catholic
[7:03] church is not right we're going to
[7:05] protest that's what when Luther nailed
[7:07] those thesis on the wall he was not
[7:10] condemning the Catholic Church per se as
[7:12] a as being the Antichrist because he
[7:14] didn't have that
[7:15] knowledge he didn't have that knowledge
[7:17] cuz he wanted the Catholic Church to
[7:19] just stop some of the things they were
[7:21] doing but God was God was happy with
[7:25] Luther because Luther preached the just
[7:27] shall live by faith in other words
[7:28] Luther did the Penance Luther did the
[7:31] thing he crawled on the ground he he
[7:33] tried to get rid of those demons but one
[7:36] day God shown the light on one
[7:38] scripture hey the just shall live by
[7:42] faith not by those works and he pulled
[7:45] away from the Catholic Church actually
[7:48] you know what happened the Catholic
[7:49] Church EXC communed
[7:51] him so he didn't really exactly come out
[7:54] of her my people they kicked her out
[7:56] right they kicked him out of the place
[7:58] you know they kicked him out and told
[8:00] him it said he was a heretic and all
[8:01] these things but but what happened
[8:03] during that during that third seal
[8:06] was is there was a lot of knowledge
[8:09] remember that's the Man line ox man the
[8:12] man age the fifth and sixth age that's
[8:14] when the Bible became became printed T
[8:17] Tinsdale W cliff and all those came into
[8:19] being to bring the Bible together and
[8:21] then in King King James in 1611 he puts
[8:25] the Bible together all right so that's
[8:27] when man started put putting it on paper
[8:29] and a print and press Man became to be
[8:32] very knowledgeable about things uh they
[8:35] began to travel around they begin to uh
[8:38] to preach the word of God you had Luther
[8:39] and then you had Wesley come up where
[8:41] Wesley was a little bit higher in
[8:45] sanctification but they still all were
[8:47] trinitarians they still all baptized
[8:49] Father Son and Holy Ghost they believed
[8:51] in three gods they believed that
[8:52] Catholic Doctrine but God was pleased
[8:54] with just a little part of what Luther
[8:55] said the just shall live by faith get
[8:57] away from all that Penance and all all
[8:59] that stuff you don't have to pay God to
[9:01] be
[9:02] good in other words he don't need your
[9:04] money to be good you know you just the
[9:08] judge shall live by faith the faith I
[9:10] have is the faith that God has cleansed
[9:11] me and washed me from my sins right and
[9:14] then keeps me watched so we had the
[9:17] first seal the second seal was
[9:19] sanctification and the third seal then
[9:21] is a type of the baptism of the Holy
[9:22] Ghost you say well how is that well it's
[9:25] a black horse if you are still alive
[9:28] you're not born again
[9:30] you can't be born again unless you die
[9:35] first you can't be born again if you
[9:38] haven't died from your first birth
[9:41] physically no that's right spiritually
[9:46] yes if the old man's still alive you
[9:48] don't have death you don't have the
[9:50] black horse you understand the black
[9:53] horse we know is in opposition but there
[9:55] is a death to the spiritual see we get
[9:58] to spiritual part of the seals we don't
[10:00] get the natural part we get the
[10:01] spiritual part of the seals that's why
[10:03] we're trying to show I I've had many
[10:05] people that that we spoke for that have
[10:08] never seen that they take the seals as
[10:10] the white horse rider being the
[10:11] Antichrist is a great Revelation that's
[10:14] not that's just the beginning of
[10:16] Revelation that was just showing that
[10:18] there was another person out here that
[10:21] was fighting against what brother
[10:23] Brandon was preaching because he he said
[10:24] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[10:26] hand and there goes a white horse rider
[10:28] well where was that horse rider
[10:30] before he's made that
[10:36] statement he was in William brand right
[10:40] not in his soul not in his
[10:43] soul he was born again a prophet but
[10:46] light had not Shone on that part yet he
[10:49] preached the white horse rider was the
[10:50] Holy Ghost for
[10:52] years for years and had signs Miracles
[10:55] and wonders after that because God
[10:57] winked at his IGN just like he Winks at
[11:00] our
[11:00] ignorance but once light shines on it
[11:03] once that Prophet brought the true
[11:05] revelation of the seals we have no
[11:07] excuse anymore right and I agree with
[11:10] some people the seals are closed because
[11:12] if they were open you'd act different
[11:15] right so the seals are closed to a group
[11:18] of people and only open to a group of
[11:20] people that God can reveal them to all
[11:22] right so yes the seals are open and no
[11:26] they're
[11:27] not
[11:32] that's just as plain as they can put it
[11:34] they just they are and there
[11:36] aren't because you got two classes of
[11:38] people and that's
[11:40] it you got a True Believer and
[11:43] unbeliever there's no gray area in
[11:45] between right now there's walks of life
[11:48] when you're Justified and you're
[11:50] forgiven of your sins you have a walk in
[11:52] life as you walk through life and sure
[11:55] God will save you because of what you
[11:57] have confessed but there's going to come
[11:59] a point in time where you're going to
[12:02] realize something happened in
[12:04] justification then you're going to
[12:06] realize something happened in
[12:07] sanctification then you're going to
[12:08] realize that he did kill that old nature
[12:11] of that old man he can't kill your soul
[12:14] or he killed the person you are but he
[12:16] kills the old nature you were born with
[12:18] that's why Jesus said Nicodemus you must
[12:21] be born again he didn't say we need to
[12:23] be born again cuz he was born right the
[12:25] first time he was Body Spirit and soul
[12:28] almighty God
[12:29] we're Body Spirit made down here and our
[12:32] soul was given to us by permission of
[12:34] God and if it goes through life the
[12:36] nature of that person will be evil
[12:38] that's
[12:39] right so there has to be a death that's
[12:43] Nicodemus you must be born again in
[12:45] other words you got to die and come back
[12:47] up a new person that's why when we
[12:49] baptize people we baptize them and they
[12:51] come back up in the newness of Life why
[12:54] they're old man's dad
[12:57] crucified not divorced
[13:00] black horse is not
[13:02] divorce that means something's still
[13:04] alive if you divorce it but if that
[13:06] thing's dead see you can marry again you
[13:09] can marry Christ if you're not you're
[13:10] married to the old you're married to the
[13:12] devil that's why the brother R had to
[13:14] come and show that that Satan and God Is
[13:16] So Close they would almost deceive the
[13:19] very La so that's why the seals had to
[13:21] open up that
[13:24] breach cuz from a sinner to a saint the
[13:26] breach is Jesus Christ I don't care who
[13:27] you are that's right
[13:30] and he showed that breach brother Arthur
[13:32] Satan was riding right down through the
[13:33] church ages right there with god he's a
[13:36] closest thing to God there
[13:38] is right he was riding right down
[13:41] through those Church ages right there
[13:43] with them with God he was in his
[13:46] shadow but when it comes to the end time
[13:48] brother BR said there's too many Loose
[13:50] Ends to be tied up what were the Loose
[13:52] Ends this guy excuse me this guy was
[13:55] playing Church M and it was time to say
[13:59] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[14:00] hand and there goes the white horse
[14:01] rider he was showing the
[14:03] separation he was showing that there
[14:05] goes that other guy there goes that man
[14:07] that man of sin that's sitting in the
[14:09] temple of God showing himself to be as
[14:12] God now we know it's going to be a
[14:14] temple over there but remember what D
[14:16] said Sunday or Wednesday if we're here
[14:19] to see all these seals break in their
[14:20] natural form we've missed it we don't
[14:23] see the man of sin sitting in the temple
[14:25] of God we see him sitting right here
[14:27] that's right then when we see him go
[14:29] away riding away then what you got you
[14:33] got God Almighty standing there in the
[14:35] form he wants to be which is the bride
[14:37] he doesn't want this he wants separation
[14:40] come out of her my people separate
[14:42] yourself from that unclean thing oh but
[14:45] it looks so pretty John admired it even
[14:48] in Revelations with the baptism of the
[14:49] Holy Ghost he looked at that church and
[14:51] he the Bible said he admired it brother
[14:53] Bram said he looked at it and said it
[14:55] was beautiful wondered why that church
[14:58] wasn't a good church right he's talking
[15:00] about the people not a building that's
[15:02] right he's wondering why that group of
[15:03] people is not as good as him well God
[15:05] just wrote him right down through the
[15:06] seals when he showed him the Thunders he
[15:08] said John don't write cuz it's going to
[15:11] be revealed at the end time seal it up
[15:14] put it back up people at the end time
[15:16] will will take over all right for
[15:19] seal I know y'all all been here but some
[15:22] of you hadn't so we kind of go through
[15:23] this again fourth seal what is the
[15:24] fourth seal and when I open the fourth
[15:26] seal I heard the voice of the four Beast
[15:27] fourth Beast who was the fourth Beast an
[15:30] eagle all right so we're going up into
[15:33] the prophetic the last seal is parallel
[15:36] with the last Church age the seventh
[15:37] Church age messenger was an eagle and we
[15:41] have the eagle anointing is that
[15:45] correct but Satan's still
[15:48] riding he's still
[15:50] here and when he had opened the four
[15:52] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[15:53] Beast they come and see and I looked and
[15:55] behold a Pale
[15:57] Horse now I told you you before take
[16:00] white take red and take black put it in
[16:03] a little container and Stir It Up you're
[16:06] going to get the most putrid pale chalky
[16:09] nasty looking something between black
[16:11] and white and red you ever seen in your
[16:13] life but what is the last horse the last
[16:15] horse rider is all the other three
[16:18] combined remember Satan gets his power
[16:20] just like God gets his power he gets his
[16:22] power in the people gather the people
[16:24] together well what's Satan done in this
[16:27] age he's gathered all those horses
[16:29] together and but what happens in the
[16:32] last age Behold a Pale Horse and his
[16:34] name that said on him was death now here
[16:36] we come with a
[16:38] name this is the only age that the name
[16:40] of Jesus Christ in its entirety I said
[16:44] in its entirety now the first three ages
[16:46] they had the fullness they had the
[16:48] fullness for their age but this seventh
[16:50] age has got all the ages combined just
[16:53] like Satan wraps all three of those
[16:54] horses into one pale God wraps
[16:57] justification sanctification and the
[16:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost he wraps it up
[17:00] and puts it in a group of people and
[17:02] gives them the pure unadulterated word
[17:05] all right so you got justification
[17:06] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[17:08] which is black then you've got the last
[17:11] number four which is all the other three
[17:13] combined which is the word of
[17:15] God all right so you got to have
[17:17] justification you got to have
[17:19] sanctification you got to have the
[17:20] baptism of Holy Ghost to know what the
[17:23] word says is that correct all right you
[17:25] do not know what the word says until
[17:27] then you say well I can read
[17:29] well you know what I was reading
[17:30] scripture the other day where Jesus
[17:31] talking about
[17:33] Ting talking about
[17:36] U Jesus was talking to the people and he
[17:39] was telling them he said
[17:41] look of course it was coming through
[17:43] Paul but he said ever
[17:45] learning never coming to the knowledge
[17:48] of the truth ever learning that's what
[17:51] we got in the message
[17:52] Church a lot of Learners a lot of people
[17:56] that can read a lot of people want to
[17:58] know all these great things and can't
[18:00] live the simple
[18:01] thing amen I'm telling you people
[18:04] everybody wants to know about the seals
[18:06] but they ain't got you got to have faith
[18:08] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[18:11] godliness brotherly kindness working in
[18:13] your life before these seals are going
[18:15] to open to you you're going to maybe
[18:18] understand them in a baby form but
[18:19] unless you get that statute of a perfect
[18:21] man right in
[18:24] you seals are no good now no shame to
[18:28] that because you know what faith of the
[18:29] fathers you're in a group with Paul
[18:31] irenius Martin some of those great ones
[18:34] that was the faith of the fathers they
[18:35] had the water baptism right they had no
[18:37] eternal hell right they had water
[18:39] baptism right but they
[18:42] died that's why I'm telling you the
[18:44] first four seals does not destroy
[18:48] death it shows death destroyed but it
[18:51] doesn't destroy that right everybody
[18:54] understand that got some eyebrows doing
[18:57] this but it doesn't because the fourth
[19:00] Church mean the fourth seal is the
[19:02] rapture well there's Millions upon
[19:05] millions of people going to take a
[19:06] Rapture that's laying in the grave and
[19:09] dying today laying in a grave that's
[19:12] never going to understand what these
[19:13] seals
[19:15] are it wasn't a requirement when they
[19:17] were
[19:19] alive but as long as we're alive it's a
[19:22] requirement in this church age the seals
[19:24] have been open the book has been open
[19:27] and it's calling the name are the ones
[19:28] in the book like Dad said it's sealed up
[19:32] though remember when you're baptized
[19:33] with the Holy Ghost you're sealed until
[19:35] the day of redemption but what's sealed
[19:37] up that's got to work inside of he's not
[19:40] just sealed up and put on the shelf
[19:41] right what John do with the book he ate
[19:46] it brother Arthur you didn't see the
[19:48] book anymore you saw
[19:50] John but the book was in John that's
[19:53] right you never saw the book we're not
[19:55] going to walk around with these in
[19:56] heaven that's right this will be
[19:59] disappeared in here the seals will be
[20:02] disappeared in here we're not going to
[20:04] walk around with a quotebook in heaven
[20:06] no we are going to be the quotebook we
[20:09] are going to be the Living Word made
[20:10] manifest in another form they were all
[20:13] the Living Word made manifest in another
[20:15] form but they did not have the opening
[20:16] of the seals they did not have that
[20:18] eagle anointing where you can see this
[20:20] way this way this way and this way a
[20:23] line is real
[20:25] Fierce a Lon is real fierce but he's on
[20:28] This Tall right real Fierce though man
[20:31] he can kill you but he can't see no Tall
[20:33] Grass This Tall line can't say a thing
[20:36] that's what was happening in that first
[20:37] church age they were first three ages
[20:38] they were bold forget that thing they
[20:41] were
[20:41] bold they had a lot of grit they knew
[20:44] what they were talking about but they
[20:46] couldn't see no further than that grass
[20:49] above their head cuz the Lin's about my
[20:51] size right here even a big one but now
[20:53] the ox is a little bit bigger he can see
[20:56] a little bit further but he eats a lot
[20:57] of grass
[20:59] so he has to do this the man stands up a
[21:02] little higher you know we can see a
[21:04] little further we can even with
[21:06] knowledge get on the ladder and see a
[21:07] little further which an ox can't do that
[21:11] and a lion can't do that they're
[21:14] Earthbound right a man's Earthbound in
[21:17] his natural form we're Earthbound we
[21:19] don't have wings but now watch an eagle
[21:21] though that eagle can go up higher than
[21:23] anybody soar up see way out he can see
[21:27] all the way in you know as long as he
[21:28] flies he still sees the curvature of the
[21:30] earth he can go all the way around the
[21:31] earth and and he is not impeded in his
[21:33] sight his sight is what
[21:36] Eternal that's why we become Eternal
[21:40] creatures ni candy Eternal creatures in
[21:43] God and in this last Church age God has
[21:47] give us the revelation of these seals to
[21:51] change our body now here we go back to
[21:53] what I said about the first four because
[21:55] we're going to read if you have your
[21:57] seal book bring it next Sunday we are
[21:59] going to read more out of
[22:01] it in the fifth
[22:05] seal right
[22:09] here don't know if we're going to have
[22:11] time to get that one let's just hang on
[22:14] then let's read this first all right in
[22:17] the fifth
[22:18] seal page 306 but it's
[22:21] paragraph
[22:24] 77 72 he reads there's no Beast there
[22:27] and represents power we know that
[22:29] there's no living creatures now I want
[22:31] you to keep that in your mind now let's
[22:33] read
[22:35] Revelations chapter 6 verse 1 through 8
[22:41] is the four seals opening right the four
[22:43] seals opening up now brother Rand said
[22:45] the Rapture takes place on the fourth
[22:49] seal but we still got five six and seven
[22:52] all right everybody get that so far we
[22:54] got we got 1 2 3 4 four and then the
[22:59] Rapture takes place right all right we
[23:01] go up we're this is the this is the
[23:04] church agent ver three one two right
[23:07] here and one makes seven that's all the
[23:09] church ages you say what about the fifth
[23:12] sixth and seventh
[23:14] seal when brother Brandon reads that
[23:16] fifth seal he doesn't see a combat Beast
[23:18] he doesn't see any
[23:20] Riders why he says there's no living
[23:23] creatures left why rides to the rapture
[23:27] they're not on the earth
[23:30] anymore 1 2 3 and four then a Rapture
[23:32] take place on the four seal you say well
[23:34] how in the world that we got 5 six and 7
[23:36] now what's going to happen what we're
[23:38] going to go through next start next
[23:40] Sunday SE 5 6 and 7 is for one
[23:45] thing and that's for this guy right
[23:48] here right now we understand these are
[23:52] these are if you don't have the inside
[23:53] guy you're not going inter rure that's
[23:56] right if you don't have the inside guy
[23:57] he's not going to take over this outside
[24:00] guy that's right so if you're not born
[24:01] again don't worry about it you're going
[24:02] to miss it anyway that's right but if
[24:05] you're born again like I said there's
[24:07] millions of people that don't understand
[24:08] this that God said okay that's fine but
[24:11] I'm going to have one group of people we
[24:14] which are alive and remain that's right
[24:17] that's going to stand and let Revelation
[24:19] the revelation of seal 56 and 7 so
[24:23] permeate our being till we're going to
[24:24] be changed in a moment in point this guy
[24:29] the inside gu already went through it
[24:30] change it don't change no more it's just
[24:33] as Eternal as God ever was or ever will
[24:36] be you can't add more to
[24:39] God but you can add more to your
[24:41] Revelation because you were born between
[24:44] Satan and Eve or your mom being born in
[24:45] your Mom and Daddy's you know sex act
[24:48] but the ones inside of you you've heard
[24:51] me preach it many times Genesis 1 dad
[24:53] preaching Genesis
[24:55] 1 and that's what that book I was
[24:57] talking about book book of books that
[24:58] book of books is that Genesis 126 that
[25:01] those people never sinned in the first
[25:03] place they never had sin that's why the
[25:06] book was worthy enough for the lamb to
[25:08] reach and get
[25:10] it he's not going to get a smudy book
[25:12] and all that seen happen in glory we're
[25:14] already glorified that's right but he's
[25:17] got to show the seene brother R said I
[25:19] was reading it the other night he said
[25:20] the fourth seal I mean the fourth
[25:23] chapter of Revelation I'm getting too
[25:25] fast the fourth chapter of Revelations
[25:27] the bride goes up right so that's a
[25:29] Heavenly scene us around the throne
[25:31] praising worshiping God who's there the
[25:33] four beast that's right every where the
[25:36] four beasts are is where the bride is
[25:38] because we are those four beasts made
[25:40] manifest in human form right all those
[25:44] four Beast lonox Man and Eagle you all
[25:46] have that anointing today if you have
[25:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why
[25:49] brother randam saw that though he he saw
[25:51] those four creatures
[25:55] gone he said therefore the Rapture must
[25:57] have taken place because chapter four
[25:59] you see them in heaven so four is a
[26:02] Heavenly scene five is a Heavenly scene
[26:04] but brother R said number four is being
[26:06] there number five shows you how you got
[26:08] there right Revelation 5 shows us how we
[26:12] got there what the lamb took the book in
[26:14] that lamb don't take the book and change
[26:15] somebody's body out here there's no
[26:18] reason to shout that's right right
[26:20] that's why John was crying amen John was
[26:23] crying cuz he said if this guy don't get
[26:25] redeemed right we just going to keep
[26:27] keep dying and keep going on but he saw
[26:29] seven horns and seven eyes John had
[26:33] already wrote about the church ages he
[26:35] knew there was only seven of
[26:38] them I just got that I don't know where
[26:41] that come from but see he got that seven
[26:44] he saw seven if he looked at that lamb
[26:46] and saw seven horns and seven eyes
[26:48] that's why he was crying he said it was
[26:51] over Church Ages were done everything's
[26:55] finished why is that book book still in
[26:58] the hand because the book in the hand of
[26:59] the one on the throne is the Father's
[27:02] Throne the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:06] that's what goes into the Rapture is the
[27:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:11] right but like I said before a theophany
[27:13] can't bleed so what was sitting on the
[27:15] throne of your heart down through seven
[27:17] Church Ages was the baptism of the Holy
[27:19] Ghost that was the father's
[27:21] Throne that father had the book but
[27:24] there had to come a flesh God
[27:28] come and take that book it's an imorph
[27:32] it's not two people right God standing
[27:35] here with the book sitting here on the
[27:37] throne of your heart the baptism of the
[27:38] Holy Ghost the rapturing faith sitting
[27:41] there but the book's in his hand but as
[27:43] long as that book stays in his hand
[27:45] man's physically going to die and that's
[27:46] what John was looking at man is
[27:48] physically dying dying dying dying look
[27:50] around me he's and he was almost 90 he
[27:53] was getting close to
[27:54] 9 so I mean he was he was almost dead
[27:57] brother Arthur himself and he was crying
[27:59] why are we still dying y but when he saw
[28:04] that flesh God who he had met saw him
[28:07] die on the
[28:08] cross that's why he began to shout he
[28:12] knew that man was worthy cuz he was a
[28:14] flesh man at one time that was a lamb
[28:17] that was bleeding theophanies don't
[28:19] bleed cuz theophany God what come to you
[28:22] to New Birth But realize this I don't
[28:24] want to confuse you God is a spirit
[28:27] that's right right they that worship Him
[28:30] must worship Him spirit and truth that's
[28:32] that's that's the Eternal God that's the
[28:34] god sitting on your throne today Spirit
[28:37] God but when that Spirit God comes into
[28:40] that
[28:41] flesh I don't care if you're born in sin
[28:45] shape and in iniquity now see Jesus was
[28:47] born sinless that's right he was worthy
[28:50] to take the book but those inside that
[28:52] book were worthy it just took somebody
[28:54] to break that thing open like I was
[28:56] showing you the the illustration I hope
[28:58] that was good about in Deuteronomy that
[29:00] father was
[29:02] tired of people talking about his
[29:05] daughter a she was this no she was that
[29:07] oh she wasn't she was nothing down
[29:09] Through the Ages but buddy when he laid
[29:11] that cloth that token of her
[29:13] virginity there was no
[29:16] doubt there was no doubt she was a
[29:18] virgin right and all that she had done
[29:20] all they thought she had done he said
[29:22] shut up there's the evidence and that's
[29:24] what Jesus did when he took the book he
[29:25] said here's the evidence it said a
[29:28] bloody lamb here's the evidence that I
[29:31] can take this book and open it and show
[29:34] the people that's in it but see in type
[29:38] you and I like Daddy said you got to
[29:39] take a
[29:40] book cuz your name's in there you got to
[29:43] claim that book that Bloody lamb brother
[29:45] R said here stands a lamb with a book in
[29:47] his hand tonight and there goes the
[29:48] white horse rider who was the
[29:50] lamb inside of
[29:52] him the lamb was inside that man the
[29:55] Lamb's inside of you if you're born
[29:56] again today
[29:58] but he don't want to stop there he wants
[30:00] the book to be totally completed that's
[30:03] right he wants the people to shut up be
[30:06] silent this is my people brother bis was
[30:09] doing a good job of that you know Friday
[30:11] but hey we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[30:14] and we have moved from church to bride
[30:17] to wife right cuz once that once that
[30:21] Daddy laid that cloth down you know what
[30:23] that was a symbol of she was somebody's
[30:25] wife now right she was no more his
[30:28] little sweetheart girl he was no more
[30:30] she was no more a bride
[30:32] waiting she was
[30:37] married the honeymoon had been
[30:40] consummated she was now his wife and
[30:43] there was nothing anybody could do about
[30:45] it if you keep it straight now this junk
[30:47] they do out in the world but keep it
[30:49] straight that was somebody's wife she he
[30:52] had claims on her
[30:54] until remember what I said until your
[30:56] daughters
[30:57] you're your daughter's Holy Ghost until
[30:59] what until that daughter comes out from
[31:01] under your roof I'm talking about the
[31:03] natural now you're her Holy Ghost until
[31:07] that daughter comes out from under your
[31:08] roof you're her Holy Ghost that's what
[31:11] the prophet said right but now once she
[31:13] is married and consummated a marriage
[31:16] fathers it's okay that's still your
[31:19] daughter but she's not yours like she
[31:21] used to be
[31:22] anymore she's took on somebody else's
[31:24] name she's
[31:26] died June Thomas
[31:28] died 33 years ago right when she took my
[31:33] name she'll never be June Thomas anymore
[31:36] why she died right same way with us I
[31:39] call you remember there's Brides brides
[31:41] churches churches I read the quote to
[31:43] you upstairs Brides brides churches
[31:45] churches he said but there'll come one
[31:47] that will be the wife that will be the
[31:50] one that will consummate this whole
[31:51] thing and God's going to stand up and
[31:53] say that's my wife and there's the
[31:55] proof but it's got to be the blood got
[31:57] to be the blood it's always got to be
[31:59] the blood even now in this fifth seal of
[32:00] Grace that we're going to start talking
[32:01] about it's got to be the blood of Jesus
[32:04] Christ it all got to go back to the
[32:05] blood everything's got to go back to the
[32:07] blood not the literal compound of the
[32:09] blood but the meaning the life behind
[32:10] the blood all right so now just for
[32:13] about one minute we got four
[32:16] seals reg takes place on the four seal
[32:19] but you got to there's got to be a group
[32:21] of people right in here that's going to
[32:24] consummate this thing
[32:28] right there right in this I'm putting it
[32:30] right here at the end of this church age
[32:32] the seventh Church age cuz then we take
[32:34] a Rapture somebody's got to be changed
[32:37] in the body so we're going to start next
[32:38] Sunday bring your seal
[32:40] book read the fifth seal see how many
[32:44] times I want you to Circle if you don't
[32:46] like her wri in your
[32:47] book write it
[32:50] anyway every time brother brand says
[32:53] Grace in that fifth
[32:55] seal because remember remember the fifth
[32:57] seal is to a group of
[33:00] people that don't even want God they
[33:03] don't know one Speck about Jesus Christ
[33:06] they don't know nothing about this
[33:08] man you talking about true
[33:11] justification see this is justification
[33:13] here that we're talking about here
[33:14] that's when you become white righteous
[33:17] in your walk with God your sins are
[33:19] forgiven you keep walking in the
[33:20] sanctification the unclean Spirit goes
[33:22] out walks in dry places and if you don't
[33:25] fill it up with something he's going to
[33:26] come back can fill you with a religious
[33:28] spirit but if you go on and go to the
[33:30] next step that's death to you God comes
[33:33] in and says hey I'm going to give you my
[33:35] spirit all right then you're going to
[33:37] begin in the fourth seal which is all of
[33:40] them combined you're going to begin to
[33:41] understand this word you going to begin
[33:43] to understand what this word says so do
[33:46] not think that the
[33:48] seals is revealing the Antichrist
[33:51] brother R never says that he says he
[33:53] says the seals reveal Jesus
[33:55] Christ this is all Christ but the bride
[33:58] goes up the four
[34:01] seal but you got to have five six and
[34:03] seven before we get out of here all
[34:06] right so we're going to explain that
[34:08] real slow read the fifth seal read
[34:11] chapter 6 verse well read the fifth seal
[34:13] in the Bible then read the fifth seal in
[34:15] your book Circle every time brother BR
[34:17] talks about
[34:19] gra cuz how many of you were looking for
[34:21] God when he found
[34:22] you
[34:24] nobody we didn't even want him
[34:28] didn't even want him brother AR we
[34:29] didn't want him because our old nature
[34:32] was against him but see he comes looking
[34:36] for us and when he does he said hey I
[34:38] want
[34:39] you I'm going to justify you whether you
[34:42] like it or
[34:43] not then you begin to like it then you
[34:47] begin to love it then it's a love affair
[34:50] right
[34:55] okay yeah
