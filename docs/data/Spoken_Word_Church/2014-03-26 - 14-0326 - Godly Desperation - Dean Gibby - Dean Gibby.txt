I just uh it's an honor to be back and I'm back it's been a long time but God is uh God is good he's merciful he's patient amen so what we got to do is just uh find God find his way and walk in it thank you Jesus I just uh I wish I was better Ted but I'm just a whole time preacher that maybe I'll get to it before so weird now listen that's let's listen real good let's just pray before we read father in the precious name of Jesus Christ we're approaching the throne of grace and mercy Lord knowing dear God no matter what we could say Lord God if if that great Dynamics was an idiot father it wouldn't be father we believe that that you're here Lord not only tonight Lord but you've been here Lord God I've watched a week after week after week month after month year after year our brothers just lay the word down lord but father tonight Lord God I'd like to see what it's done I believe Lord God there's a way it's not just sitting and listening and and not not really uh you can even participate and not know nothing but God the two Cadillacs is sitting there father they look just alike Lord two authors just put them together one of them's life and one of them's death and there's got to be a way Lord God and we know it's the word but it's not just a word it's the Dynamics in the word and father we as pray tonight that I'll be able to say something that will help somebody Lord that's all I've ever wanted to do is just help somebody Lord if it's one or if it's more God just help me to do yield and humble myself before you Lord God and use me Lord for thou in thy way in Jesus name amen and she started out by this I got a I I hope y'all don't get nervous all these uh pages I got up here we should would bro Wade and uh Brother Sam I tell you brother it's it's uh it's a people needs to really get serious about this thing because if there's no sincerity it may not be no justification for you so we got to be sincerely grateful to God and obedient to God now let's just start this off now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen now to me this scripture is just exactly like Hebrews 13 8. see we need to understand I mean I I was reading here a while back in on uh on this talking about Judas and and I was I had some notes I was going to bring on and talk about it but uh he would Brothers he was justified and sanctified and showed his colors there it didn't go up you know but you know he said his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life now what do you think about that the Lamb's Book of Life what do you think about a church see you can't you can't always read these these notes and get and get it you can't always read Webster right you are strong concordance you can we can find out what words but listen long ago they didn't have commas and periods and and stuff like that it had Revelation right right so let's just uh let's just uh read this one more time and let's be seated now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you can be seen now listen let me say I'm this is how I see it and that's all I can do is I can preach I can only do what God shows me to do and and I'll do that if no matter what now Faith is a substance how do you interpret that Faith well that's Revelation brother give me it is what is substance say well that's Faith that's God amen faith is is a substance or substance brings the faith of the all the Hope in the Bible the things it ain't seen now these things there's promises made for us and we must fulfill those promises and we must see what those promises is and there's a way to get there if we can if we can do it right there's a way let's go on a little bit now Faith is a substance the substance is God and the faith is of God and by having that in your new birth you've got the promise of everything in the laodice your age plus all the way back to capture that's why we're called to do something we're called to make manifest the rapture to bring God on the scene to vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17 30. amen amen Hebrews 13 8 John 14 12. we're we're called on to manifest these things and we it is not going to come except through desperation it's going to take a Godly desperation like we've never known because we talk about a a Rapture in faith that he said would come amen he said it would come brother he said something he said well that's what's happening the life of it now when he when brother Dale and bro wait the ministers preach see it's the it's a life in there and this is what we could be missing because if we see this if we see what's going on and it don't make you desperate somewhere wrong right so what he said God says you can't make yourself desperate no you can't but Christ can against who Christ is Christ is the word and if you don't see the word and it don't make you desperate listen I've said here for years and years and years and brother Dale has said a lot of things that I didn't understand but it put me in desperation the moment he said it right and I'd never come out of desperation until God showed me that right I got a little something here if I can find it I just scratched this out this morning may not mean nothing anybody but it means a lot to me every day every service we're 10. we have a decision to make are we going to believe and accept the truth from a time I get up in the morning and it should be all of us till I lay my head back on the bed at night I've been making decisions choices to make what kind of choice for God are we making what kind of decisions are we making are these choices and decision being made through desperation because brother Brown said be desperate to perish do we read the books do we really because you know he said in these books and takes lives Rapture and faith do we know I was thinking about Judas want to go he's in these notes here it says his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life now how can that be but see these people apparently don't know how to break that down right right now being you do because we have a revelation the Lamb's Book it's a the lamb it's a it's a lamb with a with a what that you you say Peggy that was in between that right there well whatever it's a gap hits the Gap it's it's a it's a the Lambs it's it's it's his book right right he put a book of life out there a book of life but he's got a Lamb's Book of Life with our Eternal names on it that he and we're to get the Revelation all the way back to the attribute because you can't add nothing to God you can't take nothing from God so we're always there a high is one of the greatest Mysteries I have ever I don't even know how to talk about it how God in in in his great being could be there and and produce I mean he ain't adding that because he's there he knows how you can get into that mystery he has to bring you there and show you because election that he said he said it different ways but it's the same thing election looks to forek knowledge now if I've got the new birth then God's foreknowledge is in my soul so he takes that four knowledge and he shows me that I am his elected and by me showing me that I am his elected he showed me my predestination and my predestination needed by this it is all happening right here it shows me my destiny right right he uh preached the seals and he said now we can say these by words I mean I gotta I've said it just like the Lamb's Book of Life how many times have I read that right but he finally somebody wise they'll be fighting the later quotes they started breaking that down I said praise God for that right because people read it and don't know it and they won't ask nobody well maybe maybe some does it and that's good right that's good but uh he preach those seals and he he said when he this was in March and he preached seven seal he said a fold opened today yeah we know this he said a fold open yesterday and one opened today and what I heard rather I seen and couldn't make it out now the fold he seen yesterday was a fir or the 6C it was the entire book of sanctification because we're the one the life in it the life in it is a book of sanctification and he stood there with the lamb taking the book that he was and see we each one of us has to take this journey and become the book completed our part in the book completed we must see that and it's going to take Godly sincere desperation for you to make it that's why brother Brown said I doubtful does it makes it right that'll make you desperate I'm saying I'm talking about desperate I'm not talking about just I'm talking about desperate like I like I can't explain I stay I'll tell you church I stayed there my wife says Dean you don't never get no peace I said if you die to the world in the ways of the world I said what is there right but the peace we have sister Susan is a Holy Spirit see and following God and God is the word he's the Christ he's the Michael that came into you through justification and baptism of the Holy Ghost that's been fighting for you why but by the time that you were placed in your mother's womb an angel would place right there and protect you and he didn't Satan would have took your life then now he preached the seals and he brought that in in from March to July he preached Christ to Mr God revealed a threefold mystery he said in that self-seal he was in a three-fold listen oh God now I'm talking about me and you all God in Christ now that cries condescended down and come into you through justification baptism of those and it becomes a new birth and there's things you could say that would just blow people's mind I called brother Brown said that you that ain't the new birth now you just say where the baptism the Holy Ghost you've got to understand it right and you can and you must understand it that's right that's right he preached the threefold mystery all God in Christ all Christ in the church that's me and you and the kingdom restored what is the kingdom God cries the kingdom restored that's like at the end of the uh the prayer Like Our Father which are in heaven he said they are the king Kingdom and the power and the glory listen the kingdom is the words that's Christ that's almighty God and the power of that and the glory of that is in you and me see those little things might not matter to you like like uh the end of uh though you ain't though I walk through the valley of the shed of death right you know it goes to the end he says and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever what do we see there do we see a domain yes we gonna be there but the house of God is this right here and I'm going to dwell in the house of the Lord forever and so are you it ought to make you desperate Church it ought to make you want God it all makes you jump because listen I I apologize my health is kind went down but he's back I don't claim that no more it's called faith is the substance I have the substance of God brother and every promise in this book is mine he said he said you can manifest anything that's revealed to you and I tell you that all you got to do and by that Revelation is stand there only and God somewhere I'll come to it and make it manifest because he's the only Manifesto there is and age we talk about age I said age ain't got nothing to do this rapture I don't know how about Ian how old was he how about Elijah how old was he right how about Caleb I just use a few that was aged up he said I was strong now as I was when I went out I believe God's deceived the same God I believe he's a god of the impossibilities he changed the old man and old woman back to a young man and a young woman one time right showing us a type that I that we can have Divine Healing here listen I'm gonna I got in my notes I'm just kind of done left it a little bit Satan Satan will always come at you but this bride today is to become so garrisoned by God that his effects is going to be stopped on you man you hear me his effects here's a facts I don't care what you got if you hold on gotta come to it it's time to quit this doubting let's just let's go let me just right quick go to Genesis 18. I wanna I just I mean this is I mean I just uh God used to gives it to me and I try to give it to you amen yeah both my fingers just don't work like he used to I got I try to keep them licking them but look like I'm going to start doing it God is every time you listen every time you turn the bug every time you you just turn the Bible brother here's all you can do to go where you was going to because you won't just stop and preach on that oh God I said today me and Peggy's sitting in there and I was studying and I was reading and crying and praising God Amen and well Paige I turned he'd reveal something have a page he would reveal something now desperation to do that if desperation to do that to one desperation and do it to somebody else you get in that same position if you you've got to want you got to want it more than anything you got to whoa God you got to what he said he wants to heal you more than you want to be healed it's going to take desperation on your part in my part to fulfill this right it would quit playing Church a lot of times and and and it's trying to organize ourselves I'm not saying we're organizations I'm not saying that but if we ain't careful we can get we can organize ourselves how people don't believe that no I've said here brother my pastor I say Amen but you bro you ain't going on brother Dale's Revelation you're going on yours yes sir I agree I God I've always good let me tell you something he's been Peter said well he ain't saying amen and I apologize for that but I believe this man many many many many years ago when I first come to this church it was a little box here I come in and The Minister's meeting one night and I walked in and I heard some things right away I said God where have I been where have I been Lord can I ever can I ever Lord know what I heard you know a kid I could sit there by the grace and mercies of God and the brother preaching and I know exactly where he's at I know exactly where he's at and I hope he knows that I believe him I know he does I believe I've always believed his message you ought to excuse me I'm working at it this is a I think this is a very important uh part here we could go we could we could start at December brother's covered all this bro wait I mean at least cover these things but I tell you what though is revealed to you there's still a supernatural illness not made known to you and see that's what happened when brother Brown preached so seals he said a fold open yesterday went over today and I heard one he said I seen one and that's Supernatural element of that Silver Seal opened in Christ the minister God revealed and he says and the bride is part of the mystery it must be revealed can can you can you can you can I if God come right now would you be ready would you be ready would you what would your attitude be if you didn't know it was coming now what would your attitude be amen would you be condemning would you be judging or do you be sitting there just well how long didn't he how long is he going to go does he go along yeah I'm afraid I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna skip about here a little bit on the 17th chapter of uh uh Genesis you know he walked for 25 years with the promise of God to believe in God you know he wasn't circumcised if you if you read if you read I'm gonna invite you a lot I got a lot of scriptures I know I ain't gonna be able to get to but I'm gonna see them to you you write them down and I would read them I would read if listen if God is deadly were the man and he has anointed him to speak you better listen I've learned that a long time ago now listen we humans we have uh we have a disagreement sometimes but I guarantee you if you'll stop a minute and don't wait get that thing out of the way get it out of the way don't don't let it linger because he just grows out of proportion but you know it's things that I can say it I won't because I'm all I'm saying is I'm back and when Abram was listen when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham Abram and said unto you I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect exactly what if what has he been telling you there's a message that the prophet of God said oh Perfection or a perfect faith have we got it memorized have we ever even read it no I'm not I'm not saying no yeah but I'm just saying this is going out somewhere right have you read them right I will make my Covenant between me and thee and we'll put multiply the exceedingly do you see yourself there he said scriptures he said the one Eagle in the other Eagle he's talking about the wings of an eagle I'm talking about Jehovah eagle he's talking to Abram whose seat we are if we are right Abram fell on his face and God taught with him saying now God I I've just I I I'm going to try to not stop on each one of them but now what if God appeared to you in a vision or in a dream that's that's so real he looked like a vision right but let's just say you was awakened God would God would somehow hold you because he'd have to do something to talk with you if you don't and I knew it with me because he's probably make my heart stop yeah but you God didn't do something Jesus in Gethsemane was just about gold and the angels come just in time to strengthen him right so the angel your angel brought Sam but wait did each one of you it's right there with you Realm this Angel this place is full of angels and God why are they here because God is here do we believe it where's our thoughts ahead right do we do we this word should make us so desperate that we wouldn't be able to eat or sleep until we get answers from God that's the way it's done me right yeah well I got two verses read I'm gonna just I'm gonna just I will make these six verses exceedingly fruitful and I will make Nations out of the and King shall come out of thee and I will establish my covenants between me and thee and they said when he was doing that he was doing it with me and you and that seat after thee see in their generations for our devil actually come to be a god unto thee and to that seed after thee he promised he's right here in the word he promised it right and I will give it to thee and to that seed I said Thee the land where there are a stranger all the land listen this land that I'm in right this this land that that I live that he that he here see I was a stranger but he has he has made it alive and deeded it to me he he said this is my eye God gave it to me okay I turn around and get it back to him like Samuel Hannah had Samuel and brought the baby back to uh Eli to raise him in the ways of the Lord and that's the way we are to be we so confused and we and we we we can cause ourselves all kind of trouble because we can't believe God oh yes I believe God we say okay oh you say so let's just let's see I'm gonna just 15th verse and God said unto Abraham as for Sarah thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarah if I'm saying that right but Sara shall be her name she had a name change now and I will bless her and I will give this son of her yeah I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall come over her and Abraham and Abraham fell upon his face now listen and laughed and said in his heart shall it shall be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall say that that is 90 years old Bear right right and Abraham said unto God oh the Ishmael might live before thee right see he he needed a little boost like me and you need a little boost about 24 hours a day every day well see God won't somebody that so will accept him by the word that he has bring it to us that he he come down here and the word in flesh and the spirit and the quote says that he come in flesh to bring the word in our flesh not just in our sober way but in our flesh and then Romans 8 there he says to mortify the Deeds of the flesh right bring it in control don't put nothing in front of God when you get to where you don't put nothing in front of God you'll start seeing God right he'll he'll he'll be here and in his Divine word I mean he's already you talk about Divine Healing that's what he's doing every time the ministry is preaches and it's the truth your sin the Divine resurrection of God going on divine no Divine healer no Resurrection right right see we bring that just to hear in the Bible well that's going to come but right now I'm worried about resurrectionist body because I know that's going to follow right well okay well I won't get away from Israel I don't care about that too much and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory it says 18 verse first I teach that's first verse this is where I want to go and he said in the tent Door In the Heat of the day now put yourself there and he lifted up his eyes and looked and low three men still by him now listen he doesn't talk to him he's done met him he's done melchester I mean he has been blessed he has been told so we made listen I got something here in a minute Lord willing and said my Lord if now I have felt favor in that side you think he recognized him then pay is not a way I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fish and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree right oh God oh god listen let me start tonight and wash everybody's feet that'd be great with me and I will fetch it more so bread and comfort you your heart after that ye shall pass on for therefore or you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and Abraham hastened to the tent and to say her and said make really quickly three measures three a fine meal need it and make cakes upon the Earth and Abraham ran into the herd and infested calf I'm going to say and he took butter and milk and the cave which he addressed and said it before them and he stood by them on a tree and they did eat theophany in human flesh right oh God he said Beware you entertain angels unaware right right what about human Angels Messengers Messengers I'll tell you what God is a patient God I am so I am so I am so where is savior thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life we all know what that is and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him now Abraham and savior were old and well-stricken in age 99 and 90. and it cease to be what Sayer after the men are women therefore say relieve within herself sin after I am waxed oh shall I have pleasure my will my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham that's what I'm trying to tell you he's here he knows every thought you ever had and go ever going to have right and brother that you talk about helping somebody when God showed me that with me and my wife I was so dominating I don't see how she I mean she had to love me yeah I just I wasn't mean to be but I was dominating it was my way there wasn't no way but God began to deal with me and you know what I found out I loved her more than I didn't mean right that's it I don't wish I wish I asked God every day let me love her more Lord Let Me Love You More let me love your people more men I love you my disciples by the love you have one for another right okay and the Lord said unto Abraham for Abraham 44 did save her life saying shall I of a surety buried child which him old is anything too hard for the Lord right right I want you to hold that thought because God promised us some things right God I mean God himself promised it and we're the seeds spiritually of Abraham we're the completeness of that I heard bro Sam said a little ice cream I said oh God that's what this is but see we don't want as the ministers I'm saying we want everybody in this building to be there but everybody in this in this congregation has to make their own choice they make their own decision there's a decision when you come here and and are you going out the same way you come in you ain't got to do that I believe with all my heart if we if we preach it listen these brothers agree with me I believe if if we preach the truth God how you say it obligated uh we can we can bring the prophet up and show it how God would do things well we ain't deprive it but Jesus is still Jesus he's the same yesterday today and forever right right God we I just John 14 12 the things that I do shall you do also I've seen all these things myself I've seen the scriptures I got I could stand here October of Sam the other day I said we could write a book about me by my life I've seen the dead raised twice I've seen I've seen uh he uh John 14 12. I've seen it amen partake of it many times I have my eyes when I had that aneurysm y'all all remember it I couldn't see out of my left eye had double vision in my right eye I said God what am I going to do how could I go how can I preach I couldn't do anything Lord I'm sitting out on my dick God knows it's the truth son and I was looking and I was I got I was trying to keep feeling sorry for myself I said God you said it I can't say nothing but what you said Lord with your stripes I'm Healed and I and if I couldn't see it that way and my eyes started going over to the left and I said something to myself I said whoa something's happening and I looked and it just went boom it just opened my eye left out here boom I could see everything and not only did God heal that but he healed that double vision and then my right eye and we thank God ain't doing nothing he's going to complete this one day and the doubters and agnostics and all that they gonna be less sudden if God does something for you you ought to tell somebody I got to get off of it but I is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return it to thee according to the time of life and say we shall have a son right right didn't say or denies saying I laugh not for you she was afraid and and I don't I would have been too and he said neighbor that I did his life right and the man rose up from this and looked towards Solomon and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and it talks about Sodom and David I tell you he read the scriptures read them for yourself amen amen meditate over them pray while you're doing it if you're serious about being a son or daughter of God you'll do that right you'll do it every day you'll reach something every day and I don't mean just well now I got 20 minutes I that I got set aside I'm on I'm gonna I'm gonna do this well that's hard too that's good but I find I talk to her I know you I'm not saying you don't do this but I talked to him I wake up before I mean I'm talking to him when I wake up right right but the point I'm trying to fix it and make right here Sarah doubted there stood God in human flesh and say we're doubted bless us you and I don't fall into this here category I'm not I'm not down in Sarah I'm I'm not I'm not doing that but what we want to do is do where Mary said did unto me amen according to that word being to me see you send a mouthful there right okay I'm gonna just get on over here and get started with some of the things I hit I want to go to First Peter I'll tell you this stop on the way uh uh First Corinthians 15 because I started I do this while ago and and I just kind of do like I generally do I just I try to I try to bring everything from Genesis to Revelation on every verse I I just I just can't hip it because God has given it and and I feel like a volcano full of fire and wanting to spew over okay in the 15th chapter of First Corinthians oh what a hub for me this is 21st but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slip now listen and now Christ is risen from the dead you hear me right here put your you need to put your finger on yourself if Christ is risen in you you ought to recognize it and and not be ashamed of it and you are you are to but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slip to me he's the first fruits and and put me in life you know we are the blood by the spirit we are the life of Jesus Christ by the spirit that come into us and if we have the new birth high in the world can why can't we understand these words how come we can't understand the Deep things of God see that's what I'm talking about desperation for sins by Man Came Death by men came also the resurrection of the Dead we can see the type see I could see the type in Abraham and Sarah you know what brother Brown said about that see it took about three days for them to be changed I got the quote he said I can't see it no other way just for cases same occasion he said you got to watch God's numerology right so and then look at the look at what he's done to us we're god with faith we got the baptism Holy Ghost then we move up through the statue of the prayer of man and then the Thunders is revealed to us Glory it just it's just everywhere when it gets to wherever first you read God is revealing something's going on and that ought to make us desperate with the things that's been brought right here we had ought to bring it be brought since it's brought me into desperation I've been preaching on this for years but I see more now than I ever have by the way and the others I mean I I just uh as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive the promise of God bro daddy there it is you can't lose there's no way to lose Paul says dad where's your steam right Grace where's your victory you got nothing on me at God's appointed time I come forth and anybody that goes by the ground and I hope and pray that none of us goes by the ground but your Revelation speaks of your predestination and if you can't see your predestination other than in this book you ain't seen it right I ain't trying to tell everybody it ain't wrong I said I'm just trying to bring something that will so energize you that it'll bring God's sincerely desperation in you to make you want to do more I don't mean in works that's comes but I'm talking about the love of God because strange I mean you ain't ashamed right right Sam I wish I had words right I wish I had words to say listen then come at the end we shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father now now we see that that's a happening but see that in Revelation 10 1 2 and 3 The Mighty angel that comes down in a cloud clove in a cloud puts putting one foot on land and one on sea and declares time is no more that's me he's come far because he takes me from there to Revelation 5 7 it takes the book right and he takes me back to Revelation 10 7 and shows me how it happened now something has to stop death from striking this sister something's going to do it and this word is it now listen when he shall put down all Rule and all authority and power so we know this is a time this is I mean because this ended and we go into Rapture and all these things happen right but see we're still on this side and we're wanting to get there because if we don't if we don't have what it takes to get there it ain't gonna matter what goes on over there you can have the knowledge of the word until you slap full and run it over your head and it ain't gonna do you one bit of good read First Corinthians 13. read all the things you have faith you move mountains give your body to be burned right right understand all Mysteries you do all these things and the last verse says faith hope and charity but the greatest of these is Charity why because that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what it ain't just well I'm charitable person I'm gonna give you a little money it's God Amen if you ain't got God I don't care what else you got right I don't care I don't care that the congregations I'm talking about in the world it don't make no difference if you ain't got it you ain't got it and there's one there's one message and how can people listen me and my wife said yesterday evening we're sitting there eating supper and one of my neighbors coming he's a he's a great guy I mean he is he is just a jewel but he's a pastor what is that a Church of God or something like a and he's just took it over and and it was just about gone and they got what 100 people or so now and he was telling me about the healings I said right there at the table he told me I'm sitting there and I saw a gun I I look at Peggy once why and they want people being healed I mean Hill I said and I said now how can this be to think on this I'm not I'm not saying we ain't got nothing but don't misunderstand me but he was saying that and I said and Lord that's happening with him and they ain't got the word I've given books and he made me preaching out some of them books that don't tell nobody that's what I look for right I get him on the first episode of The Sands of Time I staggered him but he finally got over it he's great he's just a fine person but he's uh if the Rapture happened guess what he'd be said and I don't mean that if the Rapture happens it's going to happen I I listen I've talked to him I've talked to him his wife is kind of sharp you know she uh sometimes I wonder who the pastor is but but you know but you know God always always gives me when I'll say something you know they'll be talking we'll be talking just as neighbors and he wants to talk about the word and I'll just and once a while I'll just say something say something and boy she gets five see her I see a smoke start coming up and and I just and I just I just and I'll say something about I said something about organization I said God's not an organization oh you got to have organization in the church I said no what you need is the holy spirit leadership in the church is what you need I just come out with it and do what was you talking about back in about three steps up shutting up she did God says don't take no thought it won't be you speaking but the Holy Spirit be speaking through you now I'm talking about recognizing God and what he's doing in your life not in my life I mean that that's fine that's fine we ought to recognize if I recognize what's going on with you I can pray harder that's what Sam said I mean God he I understand it better now than I ever did right my Lord I'm glad he's he's the one who got the job still to me I'm telling you I said I've said it many times God I feel sorry for saying I mean I mean for he must Reign till he had put all enemies under his feet now Here Comes The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death now he's going to be destroyed he's going to be put into well start with he going to be putting a pit for a thousand years then he going to the great white Throne judgment and he going to the Lake of Fire but his actions his ways his his word his denomination has got we have scope got to put the whole armor of God on from the inside out and bring that Shield there that when he comes however he comes he's not going to be able to penetrate this bride do you believe that or you believe like say or did for he has put all things under his feet listen he he sees the bride call how can you listen he said I just read it I believe the bride's call well way back here under right and I said God I'm so glad you've seen me and waited on me and my wife I am so glad for that for the for the brothers and sisters that you give me oh God I am so glad I'm so thankful I thank bro Wade when we was up in Canada at that time I've had that I've had that to have I had to have just the other day I would say I I don't know if I've told you I guess I have what it has up there in a cabin and snow was ever where and I had my vehicle and I had one of those little uh racks on the back of it and I went out there to do something and his back was I mean it was I it just it was killing me seeing him oh I don't see how he made it and all at once something happened God is my witness God dropped down or come out I keep saying drop down but he come out and I I I I turned and I went straight up them steps it went right straight to him God healed him amen I'm telling you truth God is real and the same God that done that is here today to fulfill the need that you have in the greatest need I could think that you've got is revelation right desperation revelation amen so you can have knowledge knowledgeable by itself won't do it you know what I see on the Statue of perfect man where he said knowledge right there you know what I see I see the word revelation that's what I look when I when I do you get the knowledge of the word and it's revealed to you then you have the related knowledge of the word right that's what I see for he had put all things under his feet for when he said all things are put unto him it is Manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him I believe him I believe him now let me just get on here a little bit well I'm going to read Peter 1. okay this is in the uh first uh verse of first chapter first Peter and I want to read if I started 18 first oh god of mine unless you go to the 17th good gracious alive and if you call on the father who would I respect to a person's judges according to Every Man's work past the time of your soul Journey here in fear that's everything that I've said tonight I'm telling you if it don't listen the fear of the Lord I'm not saying be scared of God but what I'm saying is Lord don't let me come please help me Lord that I will sin against you that I will displease you Lord I don't want to displease you he produces a lab we're saying and you got people that God is called that has stood for year after year after year I'm telling you what I just I mean it's just a great thing that God's gave us a five-fold mission a five-fold Ministry is got the same word but they got different ways to applying it everybody ain't teachers but yet in the five four minutes today every one of them's out to teach that you take a pastor you kind of I mean listen a teacher could come along I'm talking about a genuine teacher fivefold Ministry teacher now not a school teacher not a professor but a teacher he might come and say a word but that Pastor pick it up is preach a year on it teaching you believe that I've seen it okay let me see where's where's that for his message as far as much you know if if you call on the father who without respect to a person judges according to Every Man's work past the time of your soul Journey here in fear now I would take that to heart for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemishing with that spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifesting these last days times for you who by him do believe in God and raise him up from the dead listen and gave him glory this is the one I said and he is the kingdom the power and the glory standing there in just like me and you 've done that seeing that this one that's done this thing that has finished the work he says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Brethren unto a friend's love no through the spirit until unfriends love the brothers see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently let me say that again sin yeah purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit amen you are the blood by the spirit remember that church take that meditate on it until it unfriends love the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart freely being born again not of corrupted but seated but Incorruptible by the word of God which is limited abideth forever for All Flesh is as Grace see when we get where we got a big head scripture right for All Flesh is as Grace and all the glory of man is the flowers of Grace the grass withers in the flower thereof followeth away but the word of the Lord didn't do it forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you amen okay I'm on them I want to read just a Porsche I'm going to skip around and First Kings First Kings 13 and I'm gonna go to Deuteronomy 13 verse the minister here has really tried to lay that down now we could go to Ezekiel 16. and I and I and I by God's grace his hand in leadership I can show you you and where you was at and what God did and I can show you how he dressed you and when he gets down there he gets you dressed right and it's a beautiful it's a beautiful thing how he dressed you and at the moment he got you dressed he went to that other group and God have mercy but you wasn't in one of those brother used to use that in uh what is second Corinthians he says you were murderers and all kinds of things he said and since were some of you but not now right amen think about this God has cleansed you and made you you are whiter than you could ever imagine and then I ought to see that right right okay let me give him a scripture here I want you to I I want you to see it because I I got a little time I want you now I want you to listen to this I'm going to read quick and I'm just going to expound on it just just a little bit and behold there came a man of God out of Judea by the word of the Lord into a methodology by the altar to burn incense there was a man of God here is a man of God sent by God with the word of God listen he wasn't lost he I mean he he might have backslid a little bit but see being who he was he's surprising to me he didn't have the Holy Spirit but he had the spirit leading him the spirit told him what to do and the spirit told him what to do he wasn't nobody else he said don't you have nothing to do with nobody else don't you eat with him don't you drink with them don't you stop don't you you just go don't go don't go back to where you come right right so when you started slipping you better you better come back quickly I'm talking about quickly because you'll make a decision tonight I'll make a decision tonight we'll either go out here with a greater Revelation with a greater desire to have this desperation that this poor preacher is trying to preach that knows a little bit God has showed me about the word of God is the only thing that can show you desperation and bring you into desperation instead of sitting here getting tired and enduring the message we are being enthused especially me special to me and he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord and said oh all to alter thus saith the Lord be holy Child said be born into the house of David Josiah by the by name and upon thee shall be offer the priests of the high places that burning sense of puppy and men's bone shall be burned upon thee and he gave his side the same day said this is a sign the Lord has spoken Behold The Altar shall be written and now she's done that are punished shall be poured out right okay and he came to pass when King George Obama if I'm saying it right I heard you saying of the men of God which the man of God I'm I'm expanded on that he was a man of God how do we treat men of God sisters of God we listen to the church that Jesus Christ is coming for We Are One with him and each other in him that's the one he's coming for so we better if there's any confusion Among Us in Schism amongst it we better get it out of the way I've learned that myself and it came to pass when King George I heard the sin of the man of God which has cried against the altar in Bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him in his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not put it in again to him because it's not my anointed do I promise no harm say God working God if he's working here in the Old Testament how about where he's working now right we just don't we we pray we have people pray for us and that's right and we go right back and and next day you know we'll be right back right back see if you ask God something and you ask a man of God to pray with you and for you you stand right there on that don't you let no no devil move you off of it right right and it'll come to pass through he'll come the altar also was red and the ashes poured out from the altar according to decide which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord and the King answered and said it to the man of God and treat now the face of the Lord thy God and pray for me that my hand may be restored again and the man of God besought the Lord in the king's hand were restored to him again it became as it was before Divine Healing you know you mean the Old Testament yeah I mean in the Old Testament God when when the almighty God come down he condescended down you know who that was he was Grace condescending down Almighty Grace and the King said unto the man God come home with me and refresh thyself and I will give thee every word listen he held on forth and the man of God said unto the king if thou will give me half thy house I will not go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor will drink water in this place why do you want to come around right we're unbeliever he tells you on the marriage he says don't do that I mean I we could we could get in a lot of things here in in sometimes I think people don't understand well I know they don't oh they wouldn't maybe it wouldn't take the way they do for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord saying eat no bread no drink water to turn again in the same way the thighs came so he went another way and returned up by the way that he came to bethle he's going pretty good there and he helped up pretty pretty good but watch watch come on him now their dwelled in Old prophet in Bethel and his sons came and told him all the works said the men of God had done that day in Bethel The Words which he The Words which he had spoken to the king then they told also to their father and their father said unto them which way did he did he win did he go and it came to pass and just let me see I'm doing the same thing here I guess working the two pages don't work that so it has seen what way the man Our God winch came from Judea and he said unto his son settle me the ash so they settled the eyes and he rode there and he went out to the man of God and found him sitting on the Oak and he said to him are there the man of God that came from Judah and he said I am then he said unto me come home and with me and eat bread he said I may not return with thee now go in with thee neither will I eat bread and I drink water with thee in this place for it was said to me by the word of the Lord they shall not eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that there came us he said unto him I am a prophet also as Thou Art I don't think so yeah and that the Lord saying bring him back of course it'll be a test Moses you know Moses were tested he said the Lord says I'm going to he said Moses stand there I'm going to do away with this crowd and I'm going to start a whole nation with you he said Lord don't do it you know what bro Brown said you know what he said he he told him he said they'll say you've got to buy and you couldn't get it in he said I mean he he that was Christ talking through Moses but see listen brother Brown said that was God testing Moses you know my thoughts went to he went to Brother Banner when he was in that meeting and that young man that woman was out there doing all them things he said young man stop that he said this is the place of God don't be doing those things they wouldn't stop it it went on he said it two or three times and the God says you say it what you say and blindness they blind whatever you say that's where he says he says I forgive you oh god sister Gail oh God give me that Lord let me have that he says he's working it he's listen I'm going to say this Church he's on his way he's on his way I don't mean he he's in he's inside you and me on his way to completeness me and you said bring him back until he said other Lord saying bring him back with thee into that house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him right so he went back with him and did he bread in this house and drank water listen God told the man of God what to do now I understand what Sam said listen God it was people trying to tell about a deal if I get it wrong said you you say that I'm trying to tell him something he said God can tell me I believe God enough that God can visit me he if he wants to if he want if I know it's a prophecy or if I know it's it's God he said but if he said but God it was something about maybe that and and and said he God God gave him the Revelation why wouldn't God come back to him and say wait a minute you ain't get that yes about right God why would he send somebody else like it's right here he says he said unto you I am a prophet also as Thou Art and Angel spoken to me by the word of the Lord said bring him back with thee into that house that he may eat bread and drink water so he went back with him and did he bread in his house and drink what he came to pass and they said at the table that the word of the Lord came into the prophet that brought him back and he cried into the men of God that came from Judas saying thus saith the Lord for as much as I asked disobeyed the mouth of the Lord and has not kept the Commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee but came his back and has eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the wish the Lord did not say to the eat no bread and drink no water that cargo shall not come into the supper of thy fathers and he came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he settled for him that I asked to wait for the prophet whom he had brought back and when he was going his line met him a line him he's a man of God one mistake me I got my whole message here I know I ain't gonna be able to get it I mean men of God that was please God all kinds of things and at the last moment of the life the life they got lifted up in their heart and died got killed men of God now you're talking about the people that pretending to be God I mean are Christians and when he was going and I met him by the way and slew him his courage was casting away and they stood by and the lion also stood by the carcass and behold Men passed by and saw the car casting away in the last stand at the carcass and they can't even told her to the city the prophet I'm going to skip around him and he spoke to his son at 27th verse he spoke to his sons sell me the ass and they sell him and he went and found he when he found his carcass casting away about the line and he brought and he and the private took up the cars of the man and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old Prophet came to the city the morning to burn him and he laid his cars in his own in his own grave and they mourned over him saying unless my brother and he came to pass out he had buried him that he spake to his son said when I am dead bury me into suffocate wherein the man of God is buried to lay my bones besides his bones for the sandwich he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the city of Samaria shall surely come to pass now if you just a minute and I'll skip over this I will read the whole thing on Deuteronomy I just want I just want to get just uh because I want you to do it I I mean I listen we're tried every day that we're Tried by the word we have and if we ain't had no word how can we be tried right if we just if we just got listen if we can't get desperate about the word that we that we hear and we can't get desperate enough to to approach god with that desperation that he'll reveal it to you and he will but it's going to take desperation it's going to take Godly desperation sincere Godly desperation to to fulfill the word to bring the Rapture to pass because and that's going to be so much listen we are a special designation of him we can't just listen it's ageless I got it in here it's not just putting verse in verse together verse together I mean you can be textbook perfect and not have no Revelation at all I mean perfect in this message and not have no Revelation at all right just waiting because you you see we don't need a thing we got something we ain't got it we need to be searching more and more and don't get settled down I don't know why God gave it to me but I I just uh well I do too I'm sorry I do okay okay here just just a about another hour how do you hear nobody leave you now listen very closely bro Sam said yes and the minister says this all the time and and it's it's my whole listen my whole God I believe God showed me this a long time ago my whole Ministry is warning because if if God gives it to me and I will and I bring it out I'm just using me now thinking my brothers can say the same thing for their and you bring it out I mean if if you then it's a warning right there's Grace if you receive it right you can have it by Revelation if you want it and how can you be satisfied with just uh just the knowledge of it right right you can't do that Donnie it won't it won't take you nowhere I mean the bus will pull up you'll be left I mean I won't say you I say the people will be left okay if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee sign or wonder and his son or the Wonder come to pass whereof he spoken to these saying let us go out to other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them they shall not hearken unto the words of that Prophet or that dream of Dreams listen why can you take it to Matthew 24. now I'm I'm I'm I'm telling you can you take it now he says they'll say Lo he's in the desert he's in his secret but don't you go there see there's somebody that's gonna know the truth and they ain't gonna follow these false doctrines and praise God we've had a pastor that is took those things and laid them out but I wonder how many of us remembers yeah all right I mean I listen it's if Satan is so close to the real thing and we're to see the elected if it was possible as a matter of fact he said except the Lord's showing the days oh no flesh be saved can't you can't we see can we see the world can we see that things that's happening that brother Brown spoke I got a book at the house I mean just what God is full of them but I got it is telling everything that's going on right now I told somebody about it I was talking to him on the phone was you Brooke I told him as I was with Jesus what is that what is that I forgot I can get it for you well he's tell he's talking about it right right I mean years and years and years and years ago he said he said it'd be just like it is right now Russia I mean everything right see it's going to slip up on people yeah I heard a guy I was watching news the other day kind of thing he called it a five on on the direct uh Fox News and this one guy was sitting there's five of me he's one of the moderators I guess you call him and he says they was talking about religion you know about uh what a Hobby Lobby don't want to pay for uh abortion things you know and and well he said I'm not religious I don't go to church I don't care enough about it I mean just I mean I said I watch him and I said my goodness Lord how do you lift something like I live and and he and he oh he I mean just he said but they got it right to refuse to do that by the law see law but let me tell you something this thing is going to come religion and political see all this is going to come together this world is going to get so bad so bad that they gonna see what they've done and they're going to start trying to to bring God back into it and they're going to do it they thing through the Catholicism I mean I'm telling you it's here that if you've seen that on the tube though here a while back about to pop it off oh Lord if I had to be in a Christian filled with the baptism Holy Ghost I said boy that guy said he is Meek he is really something deception I mean God the devil false prophet programmers talk about in this book I'm taught by he said talking about the devil's mechanics he's got his mechanics laid already late he said he's just waiting to bring his Dynamics into it how many times you read that right I'm asking how many times he said do you know what his mechanics is I'm asking I'm serious do we know listen I'm not trying to make nobody mad at me I'm just trying to preach the gospel I've I've done people I mean I've had them get mad at me and they'll walk out but I'm gonna I'm gonna tell the truth I'm going I'm going to do that but uh anyway okay and the side of the Wonder come to pass where if he's speaking to these saying let us go out to other gods which that has not known and let us serve them now this ain't God's like they had back Yonder this is the ones that's so close it would just see the electives right up here see you got to bring that up here right here right now right here Among Us he said in every congregation you know what I'm fixing to say these believers right non-believers he said no it would be so so that don't make you desperate I mean it makes me desperate right if there was a change see somebody is going to get such a revelation that they gonna know beyond anything that they have never owned never known before brother says give me a church full of the Holy Ghost right right God do in a year what theologians fail to do in 2000 years he says you weighed the last Gentile coming and got all anoint Church in but listen to what I did in the bottom now he said he said you'll see the mighty works of God he said but it not only then then but now too see this is what people are missing if he could believe God if we could if we could believe God is he said give me 10 in here ten sons of God give me ten and you'll see the war you'll see God you know what he said he you're saying now I say that I say is there 10 of us is anybody y'all y'all ready to go true it's true I need to go from here not mad but searching my life right in every aspect of my life I want to live and make the Rapture in the capacity of this his ship right I want it the cap to come on me with the Flames where no matter what Satan comes to me and would arrange that he brings he's going to just bounce off of me that's what I want that's what I want but then it's just yours that's what I want and I'm going to get it because he said he'll give you desires of your heart okay let's just I'm just going to do this and if I was y'all I would pick up his book and I would turn to Deuteronomy 13 and I would read it it tells you about the false Christ I mean false prophecies and dreamers and shows you the signs and wonders right there he said if it takes you to another God he said God is leading he is letting that come on you to test you and see if you gonna stay with his word right and he'll tell you if you're going down and read the chapter you'll tell he'll tell you who it is going to come and try to get you to do these things it's right here in the scripture God I wish I had time to do it okay don't do it I just I just uh I want to read it right here uh in second Chronicle I'm gonna I'm gonna do this and while you're looking for I'm gonna read this right here now Christ Mission Garfield now this has been read I mean God how many times it's been read but has it been received in in in in the form that God has come and identified himself in your revelation because he always identifies himself always does but when we accept a hybrid denomination how can word go through that it's granted when it causes it short and blows the fuse but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself The Works that I do shall you do also John 14 12. and the last days it shall come behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the horses children back to the face of the fathers are we are we identified with this listen in reality now it ain't because ain't nobody running throughout the aisles and all that that ain't where it said it's believing this word and receiving it into sincerity that God has sprouted in and be coming there and God will meet you I promise you God will meet you the substance of God we need to know that we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need to know that God is truly Justified us and taking everything out of us and Sanctified us burn a soul out and come and made his residence in us that's called the new birth and you can't help but grow in the word because it's a new birth and if you ain't growing and in there it would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead God's sister Trudy what a great statement that God in you expressing himself in his headship who in the word has become one my goodness who wouldn't want this how could we sleep right right if there's anything we'll be running to each other right right to you I mean we get strength if them Devils get straight together how much we ought to get he said one could put a thousand two could put ten thousand don't we believe this somebody gonna do it right and somebody's gonna be left said through his church have the premise in his church oh my what the anointing man now the more anointed people Oh my bring back the anointing bride in the bridegroom anointed by what accepting what Eve turned down now once she turned down right I'll just I used to you let me tell you say well she she turned the word down she brother I said she would have officially had the child she would have eventually been made eternally in her body while she was here so she turned it down we come back and don't turn it down and we're changed right here without dying can't we see this sir exactly amen let's just keep reading said to what Eve turned dad and Adam come back with the anointed of the word because he said my word is spirit see that Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept right right she turned yes she turned the word down she did listen she was the Bible says she was deceived I have a hard time with that yeah but see I've made so many mistakes like like Davey what David done I ain't killed nobody well I think I was that person in second Corinthians God save me save anybody if he can bring me to the Head ship he will you see how that hybrid condition gives you a second what he's done he told Eve don't you do this don't you do that and you can do this and Satan said but she turned around and listened to him but the Eid in the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it that's why I say election he chooses by election what he seen in himself that nobody could see he seen the part of the seed that you was in the seed of me and he knew that he was not going to make me or you make one choice for him we'd do that with our own free choice and that's what he predestinated and that sea had come down that seed come down and found me and joined himself with me and here I stand I could read where bro brim said he said listen I got a he said make yourself small yeah right make yourself small he said when you're coming to church don't don't get puffed up and he said make yourself small I used to come in we'd go to Mr meat and I slide down I did I want Sam to say I'd back him I back I backed him he'd walk out I walk out and I tell people he said he said brother said you break your fellowship I said you done broke felt a ship I said are you talking the word to you and you wouldn't shut up he's gone and I love him and I praise that I hope he's there and others their life speaks louder than words but even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestined not to do it yes sir she's going to do it he'll have it said his church would be there would I spot a wrinkled she is going to stand there in the Splendor of his word made manifest she'll be a token to the world she'll be something in the world that the world can look and say well the rest of the world is she's a holy Road she's a second cousin that's what they gonna cost we're going to be shut down and we all for a prayer we'll be shot but let me tell you something that third pool do you know what the third poll is go to self-seal uh the word test y'all remember oh my goodness I got blessed her that I woke up early in the morning okay I got they said they diagnosed me with sleep happening I said well I had a long time but but uh anyway I ain't worried about that that's something that Satan trying to do to hinder me how could he how could he do anything by Sam if God don't let him do that and we're working through it we are proven to Satan that we ain't gonna fail like the first seed did we're going to stand no matter what sister Trudy we're going to stand endurance surrender to what the words oh God should be a token in the world I said oh my goodness God is so much I'd like to I'd like to do just just to give you uh on Josiah this is in second chronicles uh 34 and and it looks I invite you to read the whole chapters then I'll give you 34 and 35. you'll see what I'm talking about now in the first verse 34th of chapter uh Second Chronicles the first verse you know I I uh I see that seeing you have purified your soul in obeying the truth through the word see they showed me I had some duties he presented it and I took it he gave me this eye he gave it to his mind Danny that's why I know you ain't going nowhere with that piece of Steel in your leg he's going let me tell you something I'll tell you and I believe this I believe it's whatever thing is in me I believe I believe that this mind is control time program said you either received God in this mind and he goes down through the mind or you reject him right all right if I hear the word and I have and I do the word faith come by here and it comes into my brain my brain works everything but my soul where he's at is it brings it in control see he give me the baptism of Holy Ghost and he gave it to me because this way he said what is the Holy Ghost given for to bring me to the word for the hour that I live the rapture he comes I hear the word he comes into my ear and goes to my brain and I accept it it goes down through those channels memory reason affects his imagination he goes down into my soul and God reveals it and brings it back up through there back through that and he comes and brings those memory reasons and in subjection he said he said oh would go and work and then he comes into CJ feels melting here I will do things like these two but he steps on his way in and on his way out he stamps that brain I know it and I won't receive nothing else right right well because of him not I I said I got the holy ghost in the brain I'm saying the Holy Ghost is to control this whole vessel that's what he wants that's what he come and that's what he died for that I believe that brother I believe I believe I believe that that that he how did you get the Holy Ghost anyway if he didn't make a way for it to come down through there into your into your soul he's been doing it you hold your whole trip with him the whole journey okay let me hurry up here Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign it rained in Jerusalem went in 30 years and he did this is this thing I want I want you to get here and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of David his father and declined neither to the right hand or to the left and it goes on I'm going to do this card of time he goes on and tells you all the things of God and pleasing God how he done all these things a man of God Amen parents of God trained of God and God accepted him and he pleased God okay okay I I mean you can read it or not it's just 34-35 35th chapter first verse moreover Josiah kept a Passover and to the Lord in Jerusalem and they killed the Passover on the 14th day of the first month his birthday I was preached on these things and he said the priest in their charge is to listen God and encourage them through this in this the service of the house of the Lord and said unto the Levi said taught all Israel which were holy unto the Lord put the holy Ark in the house which Solomon the son of David King of Arrow did build he shall not be burdened upon your shoulders serve now the Lord your God and His People Israel now let me just say this now that's three must Nots must Nots that's Christians sons and daughter of God we need to know we must not misplace this word we must not misinterpret this word right because when we misplace it Miss interpreted we totally dislocated now how you gonna get back I mean I mean we we didn't have to start if you went with now I'm not saying you can't make mistakes but I'm saying you won't stay there now this man here did all these works of God now I'm talking about and and you Zyra look at you Zara I just get that one he was a man of God his parents of God done the works of God I mean I mean he was a great king and he got lifted up in his heart right at the last of his life he got lifted up and wanted to go into the temple and serve incense instead of the priests so if you if you if you're a minister praise God but make sure you are because if you're a minister God gave you a message and it's got to be a message to bring the people to the faith of the father and to preach them seals there ain't just one going to preach them we all by that unless I said me and brother I'll be brought down we've talked a long time ago he says he had he had attained I believe a place you know and his job was to bring me to my place see they ain't no big usually yet I recognize his position I respect his position and we ought to do that with each other you've got a position brother Mark you need to find your position and walk in it you are you not just here all the time right you're out in the public you're dealing with people so all the service of the Lord was prepared to save see they stood oh God the things they they don't know this man he was a great king and keep the Passover and awful burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord according to the Commandment of the King Josiah and the children of Israel that was present kept to pass over at the time of the Feast of unleavened Bridge seven days it's hard to stop and there was no Passover like to that which kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet neither all the kings of river keeps such pass away Josiah Kip and the priest said to Levi's and all Judea and Israel were present and in heaven so Jerusalem in the 18th year of this reign of Josiah was a Passover Kip now listen listen I want you to listen this here is a man of God just like over here in the First Kings here is a man of God I mean I mean I mean illustrious life God listen he don't God don't take no slack he'll tell you one day you you went you've you've done it long enough now get his thing straight now he'll tell you he'll do it God praise God for it after now listen after all this when Josiah had prepared the temple if I'm saying this wrong yo just forgive me Nico king of Egypt came up to fight against I'm just saying now y'all have to pronounce it Channel system by you by you preaches and Josiah went out against him but he said ambassadors to him saying what have I to do with thee thy king of Judah the king of Egypt was saying this what have I got to do with I mean I mean I didn't come out and get you so what I mean what are you doing now listen I come not against thee this day but against the house where and I have War for God commanded me to make haste for birthday from meddling with God who is with me that he destroy thee not right you hear me read it read for yourself see what you think nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him he got to where he if he wanted to make war he'd make war he didn't consult God he's like David David or what David do he misinterpreted the word he misplaced the word he dislocated the word and caused a man to die my goodness can't we see please God help us sister Susan how about we need help we want to get out of here we want to get higher oh Lord if we could come in them doors so Juiced up anointed nevertheless your side would not turn his face from him but disguise himself that he might fight with him and hearken not to unto the words of Nico from the mouth of God and came to fight in Nevada and the artist shot of the King Josiah and the King said to his serves help me away for I am so wounded his service therefore took him out of the out of the Chariot and put him in his secretary that he had and he brought him Jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of his subjects of his fathers now here with Joseph here was a Josiah went into he went he he was determined he wasn't going to listen to the man of God the minute the priest was telling me are you a great king you're not supposed to do this I got Sky oh God I wish I had time to read all this stuff that I got here foreign he said I'm going anywhere and the moment he stepped and put that foot in that Temple he was struck with leprosy and died and he put him in a leper house and he died in the leper house a man of God that pleased God oh yeah so we better be careful Church I better be careful how I handled you or you handled me we better come together and I mean I mean in love Godly sincerely desperate love we ought to sow to so feel your affliction and I pray for it I mean I don't want to I have the same thing you got but I want to be able to enter in if I can do that is Christ in me that'll speak and you can you're gonna get up what did Peter what did Peter say him and John silver gold have I knew him as such as I have God's still working God's still working those are these gifts in this church now we're going to answer for it right I guarantee if we if we if we if everyone's got to get if you got to baptist hole you got to give we're going to answer for it bro about said that we don't do it listen one thing I want to say don't let don't let us do like Sarah how can this be yeah me an old woman and my Lord oh man how can we have Pleasures young people here how can this be and God spoke directly to her is anything too hard for the Lord let me tell you something now this is me talking what is it the 19th Chapter of of a of a I believe it is of a Genesis savior was 127 years old when she died 127. and multiply I mean just adding this that uh 90 to 27. 37. see how many years she live could that be now listen I don't know this but he said if you obey your parents you'll live alone with me sir got a liar could that be what listen Abraham went on and married another woman had a bunch of kids I just wonder I just I wonder about that I wonder about things like everyone I mean no disrespect I mean you know we all I hope I can just read this real quick then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we fail to get it right it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make the book is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it would require ability to hear from God now we ain't just talked about property God we talking about all of us the prophet has come and he did his job and now we're in the voice of the seventh angel which is Jesus Christ that was in him that delivered to birth the message but a special class of people it would require to hear from God it would require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but if mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear right we got to have see every the five-fold ministry is every one of them is I have to teach I don't remember that maybe that ain't the way to say it but they ain't a teacher they they can teach the word right and and then do it and go I mean but there's a teacher now I got my I got my ideas just like everybody else you know I see them I'm getting ready to I got so many things here God I want to do it now notice no matter trying to do God of service uh page 248 108. notice no matter how sincere A man may be no matter how great he's used of God listen no matter what he is he must be this see speaking of must be timely by the Bible what Moses said back there know what Moses did but that's not what God's doing today right what's he doing today it must be the Scripture it must be in season thirdly it must be according to the way God's word spoke it would be okay Oneness with God this is on volume 17 number 4 63 11 27. now this is something to consider this was back in 63 said this it may be almost past filling time see because there will come a time like that when the spirit of God will be with taken from the Earth there will be no more now this that this needs to explain it the church will remain a while third pool there's a part of the third pull the preaching to the totally lost that's going on now it's been wrong they're gonna but he just opened into word say they ain't going to receive it why why why why if somebody's got the word say and and you keep preaching it it's going to get narrower and narrower and narrower and then I mean I don't I I just I mean I've been as accused God I've been excused accused for years of exalting my passion I said I've never done it I said that's a lie of the devil I said I have always exalted the word he preaches not the man I love the man but but I but I said I exalt the word that he preaching and I do bro wait I exalt you and where the word comes I exalted okay it may be almost past feeling times see because there will come a time like that when the spirit of God will be will take was taken from the world there would be more the church will remain a while that's right preaching because it has to preach to The Eternity loss and as every Minister did coming down through the age the last part of every Ministry preached to the total loss there will be a mission now they will preach to The Eternity loss that have refused to receive it right listen I've got churches man I used to go all the time I'm never here to I wonder why because y'all listen to me now we figure what I mean I don't know I don't know how to compromise I don't know I I don't I'm not I'm not a political yeah but there's people wiser than me I know that and and I appreciate the people uh what is it it's wonders with God uh volume 10 into 6202-11 what is it you got to get with the word get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of his friends have received the Holy Ghost where we just received enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to feel every fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking he wants to feel your mind see I'm telling you don't be like Sara now please don't that's don't fall off like Sarah how can this be God said it right God said it he wants to fill up a bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thing just so surrendered in God till his word is living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life my words alive said Jesus he placed with that with them teachers believe in the Bible prophets that say the truth that say show the same prophecy that they always did down through the age what's he done he's showing himself alive among them confirming his word his word the kingdom of God his word made Power when's the last time y'all read that I'm asking when's the last time you read it what if what if I mean I know it ain't but what what if it was a it was a Rapture going to happen in the morning you're might I wish he would but but I don't want to lose nobody no sorry I love people I love people I love that neighbor of mine I love him how much I'm gonna plant a big old long Garden up he come over he don't never come see me hardly ever but when he came over yesterday he said oh yeah by the way you mind plowing that guard and everything about four acres I said oh listen now this is my writing I'm gonna do I'm I'm coming down to end because I hate to I wrote this December 7th 2012. the six-fold mystery of his coming now Daniel 9 20 24 statue of the perfect man see that's who I see in Daily 9 24 the son of man he's the one that brings that he fills us with a spirit and brings us to to the same life that he has no sin see we have received reconciliation we have to received the atonement we've done all these things and and see I believe that we are the other part the husband and wife here's a husband that will come into flesh and he give us holy spirit so we could come into flesh that's what I believe where he starts to become visible to you the headship is where what the Holy Ghost was given for for him to come visible to you now more this is my reading our mind is what is out of order with the Holy Spirit our mind is is what is out of order with the Holy Spirit he's just turning when the word comes in we can't see we can't get it stopped we can get a butt you push it and stop and that word hit right there just so he said just stay still just a minute just a moment in in his arrest her and come down see we can't we just we just got we we're tired and I don't and me too but I feel better than I did when I come our minds was out of order with the Holy Spirit this is what God wants of our own free will from the holy spirit in our soul as we have the mind of Christ his word by our own accepted his word god turns right around and brings his word back through your in my senses back into our mind is bringing it back into subjection to his word how can we listen how can we be perfect in our soul in our in our body with our brain out of whack see that's what happened when when Satan began through the Beast it was told to the Beast the east and by reason he brought her and it knocked her brain out of cadence see now people already know what I'm talking about I mean reactions and things happens from the brain so I believe God has brought a word and is here now perfecting it to bring that brain back in subjection I'm talking about subjection I said no that can't never be okay sir I mean God God can do anything God can do anything right his word back through you and my senses called and he's bringing it back to its subjection to his word this is called the washing of the Water by the word Ephesians 5 26 this light here as Christ as a Christian is like walking through mud now y'all are excited for that but you know sometimes it feels like we dragging he says we get weighed down and fall down but as a word is the holy spirit that keeps bringing our mind back to what Adam and Eve lost remember brother Brown said what the people needs is our brains baptized are brought into the same thought as the holy spirit in our soul and then I got a I got a bunch of them in here Moses Joshua Abraham three Hebrew children the Lord appeared to them the Lord would identify with him Daniel went into the lion's den guess who brought him out Moses seen him walk with him talk with him and he denied the Holy Spirit like me and you have Abraham God we could just keep going on and on I can say way Dale Sam Dale Vermont riddicks Mr Gail I give you saved bro Donnie Susan I can say I believe it but uh Satan chose a mind to destroy to destroy the flesh this is where he keeps you in a state of confusion all the time trying to to Blind you from what God has already said you all tired hey the last enemy destroyed his death we must stop Satan with the full complete word now he will keep coming against us but I believe his effects will be stopped right and that's where I got first Peter down there see after you have purified yourself right I'm telling you this is this is a journey of perfection but he says you don't get perfect what I suffer right you don't get character you don't get the nature of God when I suffered now we don't say we want to suffer but we're by now I'll tell you God can give me a revelation of this right here and I guarantee before I get home and be testified I'll be tested by him I'm coming down my goodness I found my notes I see them I will do that to you I'm fixing to close but uh but I will say this right here it's on the greatest battle it's one of the greatest messages I believe without the Revelation this right here and marriage and divorce I don't say I know where we come to his ship right we better live a step it away brother but God says I'll be with you I won't leave you I won't forsake you how you go you're going you're going to go through some battles I mean and some of them's going to be really hard and it's been hard for me but say I'm still here by the grace of God he has tried his best to stop me and not well you all know it or not he's tried to stop y'all listen now we see backyard if we want to open it open up our channels then if we can see we find this one that this one and that one thousands of them testify but the devil will try to come right back see if he could get in there at all he's got your arm around it if he now listen what he's saying if he can get there you've got to hope so you got to hold to it I've been sit down until until I couldn't say no but God I love you I love you Lord I believe you I've always believed you Lord I said if I go to the ground I go I go say and I God why you were your stripes I'm Healed I ain't going to the ground I don't believe it so what if you do I said well I just get up for you will if you've got if you've got your senses see taste feel smell in here they're all right but don't trust him unless they agree with the word see this is important this is so important they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them I'm telling these senses memory reason infection uh reason and Imagination don't listen to him if it's continuous words say God that ain't you so you've got to know the word to know to fight and combat that that's why I'm talking about the desperation now imaginations conscious memories reason affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with word get rid of it you blow a free or flu flew right quick so your reason disagrees with the word get away from me that's right if your memory and your imagination will consciously anything disagree with that when God can get a man in his hands I want you to listen to this will you believe it or not I'm telling you uh but I would believe what what God Said and when he says is anything too hard for the Lord now he's going to keep his promise he says when God can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscious everything cleaned out yeah we believe it until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there is not a devil the world can poke it out in there now do you say he just say you ain't gonna he ain't gonna keep coming at you but he can't polka dot in your Revelation go to Revelation I mean Revelation 6 and a fourth uh fourth seal there and see what his name is he's given the name death we have got to quit fearing Satan see faith is not made perfect in fear right because we fear about our bodies We Fear we're going to lose this we're going no no no we don't don't do like job done he what he feared come on him we got to get away from that we learn from these people and if you come around and say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that the fluids go so clear his shouts Hallelujah I just I heard Samson I've heard others do the olive blows a whistle glory to God it sounds just as clean and clear for the word of God to go through the power of God that's there's your Battleground your bag your belly your Battleground is back at the beginning back in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is a gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accept the spirit or rejects it the spirit you're mine right right so it's got something to do with it but he can't save you but I'll tell you where he can he could he could God can if you want it God can open it and that word will come right down amen into that soul you can have a little conscious little feelings a little Sensational it has nothing to do with it that's just a little Sensational your mind either accepts it or rejects it let none of them miss it it's your mind that opens the door or closes the door and listen to your conscience listen to your memory listen to your affection let me tell you something if you've got the baptism Holy Ghost now now I'm saying The Sinner does all this I mean that's that's day number sinner but now we make mistakes now God don't hold us responsible for that because we're morals we make mistakes but if you don't repent of it it proves something right right I mean Godly report do it listen to your memory listen to your affection but when your mind closes it itself to these things and let God the spirit of God come in he blows the rest of the stuff out every day is gone every fear is gone every sensation if that is gone every feeling he's gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against it I'm gonna hush God I tell you I hope I hope I've said something to help somebody I do I I truly do church it's good it's good to stand here again I'm just sorry that uh it's a lot of word that God has given me and I'm I'm ashamed you don't you don't I mean I've given it to a lot of people I preached a lot of people a lot of places but I will adhere to this is my church so I'm back if God bless you Brother Sam I love you say Amen let's give our brother a good hand hey truly comes by hearing hearing by the word of the Lord let's just sing and anybody has a need the Alders open that your love be made
