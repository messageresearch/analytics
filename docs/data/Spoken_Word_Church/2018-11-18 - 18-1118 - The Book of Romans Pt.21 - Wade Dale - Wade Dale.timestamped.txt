[0:00] good morning see here okay don't tell
[0:07] you well I'll see some of you choose do
[0:09] not delay that and we'll see when you
[0:17] get back
[0:19] yum only with our minds leaving going
[0:24] somewhere so I think I'm gonna go then
[0:27] get the woods not some dealers you you
[0:41] jeering comin or not so young you know
[1:06] 66 to 27 they played to be tame and
[1:10] people out the stands right quarter
[1:12] alright so let's get started here so we
[1:15] were on new Romans 10 fade away I know
[1:23] but let's go back up to verse 17 and
[1:25] kind of lap over and see what we got to
[1:29] pick this up
[1:29] yup do something what Paul has told us
[1:31] and then when we start the next chapter
[1:34] it'll kind of be a lap over back to back
[1:38] to what we're talking about so then
[1:39] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:41] the Word of God
[1:43] all right remembers in the hearing it's
[1:46] not in the speeding is in the hearing
[1:48] think cometh by hearing okay but I say
[1:52] have they not heard yes barely their
[1:55] sound went into all the earth and though
[1:57] urghhh unto the ends of the world but I
[2:00] say did not Israel know first Moses says
[2:04] I will provoke you to jealousy by them
[2:06] there are no people and by a foolish
[2:09] nation I will anger you somebody but
[2:15] Isaiah all right say he says it's very
[2:18] bold and says I was found of them that
[2:20] sought me 9 I was made manifest unto
[2:22] them that asked not after me now what's
[2:24] he talking about here I was found by
[2:26] them they sought me not Gentiles Paul
[2:29] saying that God's because remember back
[2:31] the people who come back not all the
[2:33] intervals Israel and then he's returning
[2:35] I'm reading in the book of Acts now I'm
[2:37] going back through the New Testament
[2:38] reading the book of Acts where pulse is
[2:41] low we turn to the Gentiles why because
[2:43] Israel he was preaching in Jerusalem and
[2:45] that was thrown and him throwing him out
[2:46] gonna kill him
[2:47] so he said I'm going to Gentile all
[2:49] right which is what he was supposed to
[2:50] do anyway remember Peter opened the door
[2:53] but Paul went in and did the preaching
[2:55] Peter opened the door but following in
[2:58] and do the preaching because they Peter
[3:00] had the keys of the kingdom he can
[3:02] unlock and he unlocked the door to the
[3:04] Gentile but Paul went on in to preach to
[3:07] the Gentiles and I guess inside of
[3:10] itself that really hurt him because he
[3:12] was a Jew but he knew he had persecuted
[3:16] the Jews he was accused of the law you
[3:20] know making them blasphemy
[3:22] putting them to death and all those
[3:23] things he was praying and hoping that
[3:25] his people the Gentiles would come on in
[3:28] I mean the Jews would come on in but
[3:31] then he keeps seeing the door being
[3:33] closed again by the by the Jews so the
[3:35] Gentiles I was found of them that
[3:38] stopped me not the Gentile can't help
[3:40] didn't care about garden they had no
[3:42] promise the Jews had a promise all the
[3:45] way back he's talking like Moses but
[3:48] that what they went to them it was to
[3:51] the lost sheep of the house of Israel
[3:52] but Israel turn
[3:53] down went whoring God had to what God
[3:56] had to divorce her put her away so he
[3:59] can manage in top right
[4:00] I was made manifest unto them that asked
[4:04] not after me like saying nobody knew
[4:07] even a third a third of a third of a
[4:11] third of the people knew who Jesus was
[4:12] and then the Jews knew who was but never
[4:16] really knew who it was
[4:17] that's right but to Israel he said all
[4:20] day long I have stretched forth my hands
[4:23] unto a disobedient and gainsaying people
[4:25] God do that but he's long-suffering he
[4:29] has grace he knew what was gonna happen
[4:32] that's what I was thinking the other day
[4:33] we heading down the road about 90 were
[4:37] asleep so I was thinking a little bit so
[4:38] I was thinking well I was driving but
[4:41] you know that's done you ever been of
[4:44] this why did he just stop it and walk it
[4:46] off
[4:47] no he had to let the plan of God go the
[4:49] way he saw it go because he wouldn't be
[4:51] gotten in and got in that way then he
[4:54] wouldn't be gone he'd be a dictator he
[4:56] started a that's why I believe in
[4:58] predestination do I do with
[5:00] foreknowledge and you have something to
[5:02] do with it you have actually everything
[5:04] to do with okay yes all day long now
[5:07] stretched forth my hands unto a
[5:08] disobedient and gainsaying people Nate's
[5:11] talking about who here Gentiles is
[5:14] talking about the Jews here Israel
[5:16] oh that long that stretched forth my
[5:18] hand so now watch I say then this is
[5:21] probably in the left chapter 11 he's
[5:24] continuing his talk I say then hath God
[5:27] cast away his people god forbid now what
[5:31] Paul said he hasn't totally forsaken the
[5:35] Jews he's always going to have them
[5:37] there they're always going to be his
[5:41] people he can't let's just put it this
[5:46] way God can divorce Israel for whoring
[5:54] against him put her away but she's still
[5:56] there okay physically
[6:00] same way with any of us if you have a
[6:04] living spouse then you understand what
[6:07] I'm saying
[6:07] yeah the law of managing force is pretty
[6:10] plain but we do we know we do that grace
[6:13] okay
[6:13] and God that grace because you didn't
[6:18] just cast it now she'll never be wife
[6:20] again you can't take you out back once
[6:23] you've been defiled by somebody else you
[6:25] can't take her but we can't take her
[6:26] back his wife
[6:27] but he takes her back is what the nation
[6:29] of Israel the children of God according
[6:32] to Moses in the Old Testament everybody
[6:35] got that
[6:36] so Israel is not completely camps now I
[6:39] mean man if I was God and I heard Israel
[6:43] say let his blood be on us and our
[6:44] children
[6:45] I that be it I never think of them again
[6:48] okay right that's what I said we never
[6:50] come up with grace God come up with the
[6:52] word grace we did we don't have great we
[6:55] have to acquire grace we have to see
[6:58] grace at work and we do see it at work
[7:01] with us
[7:01] gun violence God and say hey if you're
[7:03] gonna do this you're going I'll just
[7:06] find me somebody else but Noah always
[7:07] tell them they'll be servants they'll be
[7:10] there will be millions of them ending
[7:11] and not in the new city but in the new
[7:14] earth there will be millions and
[7:15] millions of Jews okay from the Old
[7:18] Testament
[7:19] all right have God cast away his people
[7:22] god forbid for I also AM an Israelite of
[7:25] the seed of Abraham of the tribe of
[7:27] Benjamin so he knew his land he was from
[7:30] the tribe of Benjamin God hath not cast
[7:33] away his people which he foreknew
[7:36] because remember not all Israel Israel
[7:38] not everybody in the Old Testament is
[7:40] gonna be in heaven that's right that's
[7:43] not an automatic process dog knows their
[7:45] what their heart he knows their heart
[7:47] and one their heart like David while
[7:52] looking graves I mean we're fixing to
[7:54] start on the fifth seal
[7:56] maybe not to you Steve but next week I'm
[7:59] not going to buy the whole piece because
[8:00] I got a working bunch for the post
[8:02] office so I'm going to be on that Sunday
[8:04] - but when we get a fifth seal you gonna
[8:07] see grace given to people that don't
[8:08] want it well mine we didn't want it we
[8:12] didn't want it and Israel turned it down
[8:14] right right so I mean you know grace is
[8:18] what brings them in and let his blood be
[8:23] on us in our job and now remember
[8:24] brother Brown said God God didn't forget
[8:26] that that's why they've been persecuted
[8:29] now for 2,000 years and during the
[8:31] Gentile time look at Israel if I wants
[8:33] to kill Israel the nation of Israel
[8:34] whatever mind wants them out of here but
[8:37] they sustain because what they're still
[8:39] God's people
[8:40] that's right my reason said I can't have
[8:42] become a Jew I appointed you I'm God's
[8:44] people God's one that told us that we
[8:45] were Jews and we could do this listening
[8:47] but there under the Old Testament
[8:49] because they don't believe Christ have
[8:52] done away with it's not going away with
[8:54] all but magnified it made an audible
[8:57] though I have not cast away his people
[8:59] which he foreknew like said look at
[9:03] David look at grace here's David know me
[9:05] and you take the rap sheet you don't
[9:08] want to write you this when somebody
[9:10] commits a crime or a crime alone you go
[9:12] and you pull his rap sheet it says in
[9:13] 1974 he did this in 1983 he stole a car
[9:17] nothing a that's a rap sheet
[9:20] David's rap sheet to me it's horrible
[9:26] horrible I mean he took his best friend
[9:30] I mean the guy that wouldn't even go to
[9:33] his wife he stayed right there at the
[9:36] gate just in case David needed him to go
[9:39] do something and then David sees his
[9:41] wife on the housetop taking a bath and
[9:43] he goes and has relations with her then
[9:45] he comes and tells the army the captain
[9:48] of the army I wonder what that captain
[9:50] thought about day because he knew what
[9:51] he was doing he said when the battle is
[9:53] hot everybody just pulled back and leave
[9:55] your eye out there well man that's
[9:57] murder that's premeditated murder he
[10:01] could get that was capital murder he
[10:02] could get the death penalty
[10:04] in this in this era that we're living in
[10:06] he get the death penalty that's right
[10:08] but he had a profit on the same and said
[10:11] David you're a man after my own heart
[10:13] God said and then Nathan comes in and
[10:16] says David you'll not die yes what we
[10:18] haven't had will probably come in to
[10:19] tell us the same thing because we are
[10:21] all murders analyzed from cheats and
[10:22] thieves and everything else
[10:24] maybe not naturally but spiritually it
[10:27] was that way and then we have a prophet
[10:29] come in and announce see if we ever see
[10:33] that there's our body change Nathan's
[10:34] didn't David that weren't the man but
[10:37] you're not gonna die if we take that
[10:39] those days that we're not gonna die but
[10:44] it's not an automatic process would you
[10:45] know what the scripture says they'll be
[10:47] lies rely John how do you make the
[10:49] intercession to guard against Israel
[10:51] saying Lord they have killed my prophets
[10:53] and digged down thine altars and I am
[10:56] left alone and they seek my life this is
[10:58] truly was that the other day
[11:00] but what says the answer have gone into
[11:02] him here's the live just saying Lord I'm
[11:05] the only one there's nobody else
[11:07] preaching it like I'm preaching it but
[11:10] once that dancer of God I have reserved
[11:12] to myself seven thousand minutes you
[11:15] don't know of who have not bowed the
[11:18] knee to the image of bail even so then
[11:20] at this present time also there is a
[11:22] remnant according to the election of
[11:24] grace was Paul saying if you'll remember
[11:27] I'm reading in the book of Acts now I'm
[11:29] telling you the apostles of Jesus met a
[11:31] group of people that were preaching in
[11:36] the name of Jesus in preaching that
[11:37] Jesus was the Christ that wasn't a part
[11:40] of their little group one will need to
[11:43] be so groupie
[11:44] there's other people preaching it may be
[11:47] apparent to you but there was a group
[11:49] coming you know what what did it was the
[11:53] Peter and one of them said Lord this
[11:55] while Jesus was still here said Lord
[11:58] what I'm gonna need to do he said don't
[12:01] fight against yourself
[12:02] leave them alone in other words in this
[12:04] one then you got somebody like you
[12:06] seeing that swear
[12:07] think of us comes in activist with the
[12:09] profit that you don't hear nothing about
[12:11] except a little a little bit in the book
[12:13] of Acts you hear about activist and he
[12:15] came in and prophesied but he was a
[12:17] prophet anyone's property gone until the
[12:19] Bible said in full holy oh yes all right
[12:21] so if sometimes we narrow we've some
[12:24] narrow-minded we my brother brown said
[12:26] was so narrow-minded we put a lead
[12:28] pencil between err between our nose and
[12:30] hip both eyes brother brown said that
[12:34] there's a quote I have it in my house
[12:36] and yet by grace there's a remnant
[12:40] according to the election of grace and
[12:42] it's by grace then it is no more of work
[12:46] now watch this is otherwise grace is no
[12:49] more grace but if it be of works then is
[12:53] it not more grace otherwise work it's no
[12:56] more work all right so what because this
[12:58] is the contention that people have with
[13:02] James that you're saved by your work hmm
[13:06] okay then Paul saying if it's anything
[13:11] to do with works it's no great this man
[13:13] but then brother branham I believe him
[13:15] when he preached wisdom versus faith and
[13:19] then he preached works his faith Express
[13:25] so that's what really Paul's saying Paul
[13:27] saying look if you see grace it wasn't
[13:32] something you did right but once you get
[13:34] grace to me it's all that you do because
[13:37] if you don't it's greasy grace you just
[13:39] keep them no you don't keep on doing
[13:41] once you see grace like we're gonna talk
[13:43] about that fifth seal once you see grace
[13:45] and you see amazing grace then you you
[13:50] turn from whatever because what it is
[13:51] what's great grace is unmerited favor so
[13:54] you didn't merit anything to get to that
[13:56] position but once you get to that
[13:58] position you do have something to do
[14:00] with it cuz if you're not if you keep
[14:02] doing what you're doing that's crazy
[14:04] grace that's what we get into with all
[14:05] these people in the mess you you think
[14:07] they're so regulated that they can do
[14:09] whatever they won't do now because you
[14:11] know the random lamb or a Rams eighth
[14:13] day or it's just it's just less than the
[14:18] flesh is what it did
[14:19] and there is no grace that's greasy
[14:21] grapes I don't believe them greasy grace
[14:23] but I do believe in grace grace was
[14:26] extended to David grace was extended to
[14:29] the pastor Ramsey where the Lord took
[14:32] him home when he went out and started
[14:34] drinking beer you know God took him home
[14:36] to Nick Martin that was great right that
[14:39] was a grace of dog it did that that's
[14:42] why I said there is no way man could
[14:44] come up with grace there's no way man
[14:46] you and I are so judgmental and we're so
[14:48] we have opinion and non opinion and this
[14:50] we just can't see grace until we come to
[14:53] God I think you see grace and like I
[14:56] said it's not well it's the grace we can
[14:58] do Mary wanted no grace allows you to
[15:03] make mistakes but grace doesn't allow
[15:06] you to continue making that same mistake
[15:07] over and over again because like the
[15:10] brother Ramsey he was continuing to make
[15:11] that mistake in God dissing ours that's
[15:13] it I'm taking you home
[15:14] of course he did brother Ramsey a favor
[15:17] right I'm taking him on home right
[15:21] could have got work she's never done now
[15:28] watch Paul trying saying you got to
[15:29] watch who he's talking to these Tom's in
[15:31] the room when she's talking to Israel
[15:32] he's talking to the people in Jerusalem
[15:34] who have it's been works since Moses
[15:38] because they took that as a book through
[15:40] the book of works the 10 commandments
[15:42] thou shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt
[15:44] not and in Jesus comes along and said ok
[15:47] you didn't touch her but if you left it
[15:50] after in your line you committed
[15:52] adultery with her already or you're
[15:53] accused of committing adultery with her
[15:55] already in your heart and then you think
[15:59] God forgive me and there's grace but 10
[16:02] years ago because we remember even Paul
[16:04] would walk into a synagogue and boy
[16:08] think about Paul walking into a
[16:10] synagogue the people he was there
[16:11] friends at one time he was back here
[16:14] with the Sanhedrin and back here with
[16:16] the Pharisees and Sadducees right all
[16:19] right now he's over here totally
[16:22] opposite the point he was before and
[16:25] they're over here going why do we have
[16:28] to listen to you you were over here one
[16:30] day and you were persecuting that's my
[16:31] Paul had to spend all this time showing
[16:34] his conversion yes
[16:36] remember he went to a Griffin went
[16:38] through the whole conversion he went
[16:39] through the conversion twice now that
[16:41] God made him on the road I read that in
[16:43] the book of I read of a black axe is
[16:45] really a good book because it's the Acts
[16:47] of the Apostles and that should be that
[16:51] should be the we always saw that faith
[16:54] of the fathers read the book like I told
[16:58] the church up there in Kentucky F it's
[17:00] really simple if you want to know the
[17:02] Acts of the Son of Man read Matthew Mark
[17:03] Luke and John and when the Son of Man
[17:06] will go to the Son of God in acts and
[17:08] read the book of Acts and that's now the
[17:09] faith of the father started that's the
[17:11] foundation of of the Gentile
[17:14] dispensation of God working the Son of
[17:16] God working through the church ages
[17:18] there's your book back so you got them
[17:20] right there this on a man in Matthew
[17:21] Mark Luke and John and you got the book
[17:22] of Acts and son of God starting to work
[17:24] in the people so it's really the faith
[17:27] of the father
[17:28] there's working in the people cuz really
[17:32] watch what happens in in acts
[17:35] magmar Luke and John tell the story of a
[17:37] life okay Jesus and all the disciples
[17:40] then he got the book of Acts it brings
[17:42] all those disciples together take Jesus
[17:43] out so some man's gone missing this this
[17:46] will help you that son of man is out
[17:48] well the son of God came back on a day
[17:50] that comes back on their Pentecost acts
[17:52] to into believers and then they start
[17:54] acting like Christians but now you get
[17:58] into Romans and all Corinthians what it
[18:00] is it's kind of everybody scattered then
[18:02] Romans Paul by the letters of this one
[18:05] Peters write the letter this one and
[18:06] it's really no more commentary of how
[18:09] they live is talking to
[18:11] he's talking to the Romans he goes with
[18:14] content and talks to the Corinthians and
[18:16] the Corinthians didn't get it the first
[18:17] time so he went back again that's why
[18:19] you got a first Corinthians in the
[18:20] second grade
[18:21] then you got Timothy and all those ones
[18:23] then you got John in the Book of
[18:25] Revelations you got he's not telling
[18:28] them he's sure he's telling but he's
[18:29] telling something didn't happen when
[18:31] Jesus was here and it didn't happen
[18:32] during the first part of the faith of
[18:34] the fathers so if you want to know what
[18:36] to pay some fathers is there she book
[18:38] look like we're gonna know what the Son
[18:40] of Man does read that but if you want to
[18:42] know how the church was built
[18:44] read Romans grant ends Timothy all those
[18:47] is how the church was built up and say
[18:49] and that's what calls talking about now
[18:51] if you'll if you'll separate that then
[18:53] you go to the very end of the book of
[18:54] revelations and see that's all future
[18:57] event so pick something coming you know
[18:59] something's coming here comes remember
[19:01] the church ages yeah it started back
[19:03] when Paul came but when when John when
[19:07] Jesus came to John on Patmos
[19:09] the first church age had just been
[19:11] started the other Church ages hadn't
[19:12] even started yet they didn't live it out
[19:17] so let's get back to our I thought what
[19:20] that Israel hath not obtained that which
[19:22] he seeketh for but the election has
[19:24] obtained it and the rest were blinded oh
[19:26] I'm sorry go back any by grace then
[19:30] there's no more of work because it's not
[19:33] do's and don'ts like I said it's not a
[19:35] laundry list of the things that you did
[19:37] or didn't do now grace covers that but
[19:43] then by your works you show that grace
[19:46] has come by your works you show that
[19:49] grace has come you don't get grace for a
[19:53] future event you get grace for what you
[19:57] did are doing amen but then our works
[20:01] that you go over the book of James and
[20:03] then like said brother man preach works
[20:06] his faith expressed faith is your grace
[20:10] because remember what do you got to have
[20:12] faith in you gotta have faith in God
[20:14] that grace is all God not not
[20:16] not any human that graces of God so I
[20:20] have to have faith come that listen
[20:23] honestly come on how do we know that God
[20:25] forgets our sins oh yeah the problem
[20:27] tells us
[20:27] I'll tell us a lot of things but how do
[20:30] we really know God is forgive you of
[20:33] your past because you know what you
[20:34] still think about it all the time right
[20:38] all the time we thinking about it but
[20:40] that's in your outside realm or that
[20:42] middle realm that's not in your soul yes
[20:44] baby called if God resides there there's
[20:47] no memories and conscience patient
[20:49] imagination of anything you've done
[20:51] except be the Word made flesh right yeah
[20:54] hey man so then this part out here to me
[21:00] and we'll get into it maybe later on
[21:01] after the seal don't want to do home a
[21:03] little thing on the on the spirit realm
[21:05] but then that's where Satan works but
[21:08] that's where God works to the nth they
[21:10] interlock inside there that's what the
[21:11] great battle is but what we got to do is
[21:14] it great with me this intimacy this
[21:15] isn't working right so I've got to
[21:18] believe that God don't remember though I
[21:19] keep saying God forgive me face and he's
[21:21] off what are you talking about and you
[21:23] know what he's honest when he says that
[21:24] he don't know those fast then why
[21:27] because he's hidden that inside man he
[21:29] is that inside man he ain't in the
[21:31] inside man boy you're saying to people
[21:33] in Kentucky when I told them that most
[21:37] people in this message were
[21:38] we're Tunis but they agreed once I gave
[21:43] them the the analogy of will Jesus is
[21:46] over here and one over here that he's
[21:48] gonna do this and I I can't do that well
[21:51] where air is enjoying air so I think we
[21:53] we were gonna start believe have to
[21:55] believe it with that if he's in us he
[21:57] can do anything he did while he was
[21:59] manning here on earth plus create world
[22:02] and everything else there's one it's
[22:06] really saying I think also the fact that
[22:09] that's because it's the one in you that
[22:12] caused you to repent turn on that
[22:14] correct gives you the assurance that
[22:17] that God you know God is like I don't
[22:20] see it because it was him him through me
[22:23] you know that that right so sure but it
[22:28] burns all that out so you got it that's
[22:29] why we gotta believe we gotta have faith
[22:33] then that what's inside of us it's
[22:37] perfect right right it don't need girth
[22:44] it is good that's right it don't need
[22:48] great yo result no Jesus didn't
[22:52] need great right so if we get what he
[22:55] gets
[22:55] he didn't need grace Michael he's got
[22:58] all mighty body spirit and soul but
[23:01] grace comes to us to our memories and
[23:03] conscience facts and imagination and
[23:05] helps us because at one point in this
[23:09] fall yeah going at one point you would
[23:11] have done the same thing back in the
[23:13] world you and I have not felt anything
[23:14] to go ahead and bring out stuff for that
[23:16] Glenn's right but it then oh sudden that
[23:18] comes in you know that's God then well
[23:21] why brother Brown said that's your top
[23:22] up you go back to that top post you put
[23:24] that top folks down and you said hey
[23:26] Satan right here I gave this thing up
[23:29] you bring it back all you want but right
[23:31] here is where my top post okay so it's
[23:35] not about works then it's by grace but
[23:37] your works is your faith expressed I
[23:40] live it like like release is saying I
[23:43] live it because I see how awesome grace
[23:47] is then he has forgive me of everything
[23:50] and I see the awesomeness that God's
[23:52] trying to tell us even now who we are
[23:54] not what we're coming to but who we are
[23:56] already cuz that makes the tunas work
[24:00] we're doing this we're separate and say
[24:01] well Jesus is here and we're here no
[24:04] he's right here he's the same person
[24:06] [Music]
[24:08] was God and Jesus being two different
[24:10] people in there that's right but see
[24:13] that's out there the nominations see
[24:18] that in the message we know that's not
[24:22] right that's the deception we know
[24:25] that's not right but we still think
[24:27] we're let's do this in the message I'm
[24:30] not saying tune is out there if you
[24:33] caught by tunas out there you need the
[24:34] new birth right I'm talking about in the
[24:38] message we have come to this thinking is
[24:40] that Jesus is doing this and we're doing
[24:42] this
[24:45] no no it's let me a mass a message Tunis
[24:53] because we know better in the Trinity we
[24:56] know better being the one that's which
[24:58] is one life you finger could you know
[24:59] what if you got if you're a oneness then
[25:01] we're counted out because the bride is
[25:04] the last form of God they say Jesus is
[25:08] the life form of time that's really your
[25:10] one that's doctrine that Jesus was it
[25:11] and we're nothing else well by me being
[25:16] on this earth I have busted that theory
[25:19] out and then we don't we don't believe
[25:21] that we got three of them standing up
[25:23] there so when you come back to come back
[25:26] to them the message that we really are
[25:28] feeling that that we've not come to a
[25:31] place for where we make died yet or met
[25:33] Jesus yet because so I told them I've
[25:36] been can't I gotta tell you to two words
[25:39] will kill you but I preach you'll say
[25:44] something and you'll come to place and
[25:46] then in your mind you go but I what your
[25:48] victim just give a circumstance but I
[25:50] but on what God don't have a but I young
[25:55] town what I mean we go but I you know
[25:57] you try to continue what God put a
[25:59] period in sit look you're the chosen of
[26:00] God
[26:01] you're hearing your commission to take a
[26:03] body chain and you know what it's all of
[26:08] grace okay
[26:09] I can't work myself into a body chain
[26:11] but if I have if I see enough grace for
[26:15] the middle man Colette for you grace you
[26:17] need grace you don't need grace for you
[26:19] flash the flash was trash
[26:20] I'm getting it getting some of those
[26:22] quotes together where brother Ramsey
[26:24] were trapped into it we weren't we were
[26:25] trapped in this we came because of the
[26:28] same between item and even the beast and
[26:30] all those things that went on this is
[26:32] our track
[26:32] yes then he comes like I said before my
[26:37] favorite quote Jesus did not come to
[26:38] bring you your inheritance remember I
[26:42] read that to them too now give them over
[26:44] a lot to think about it then Kentucky
[26:46] but I read the quote brother Brown said
[26:48] Jesus didn't bring you your inheritance
[26:51] your inheritance was before the
[26:53] foundation of the world back up there in
[26:55] the mind of God creating the world that
[26:57] give us is 1:26 man if you had a
[27:00] beginning you're gonna have anything
[27:01] evening alright so we come to a place to
[27:05] where we always want eternal that part
[27:08] that's inside but then we got to work on
[27:10] the next guy the next guys knew we gotta
[27:12] work on not this guy not the metal guy
[27:15] that's it you work on that middle and
[27:18] that memory reason content specs and
[27:20] imagination we gotta go what that Israel
[27:22] have not obtained that which he seeketh
[27:23] for but the election hath obtained it
[27:26] and the rest were blinded so Israel was
[27:28] blinded according to who's written God
[27:30] had given them the spirit of slumber
[27:32] eyes that they should have not seen him
[27:34] as they should not hear unto this day
[27:38] unto this day what Paul's talking about
[27:40] up to this day all right so we'll stop
[27:43] right there and we'll continue like I
[27:45] said will continue next next time
[27:49] they'll or glitter
[27:51] [Music]
