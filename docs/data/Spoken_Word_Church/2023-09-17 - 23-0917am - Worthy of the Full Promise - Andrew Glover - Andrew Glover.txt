morning I want to look here in John the 12th chapter also we're going to read two other places but I just want to begin here this morning and just uh something here on my heart today I pray will be a blessing to you in John 12 and verse 23 and just before you read the word let's just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer and let's ask the Lord to come Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this beautiful Sunday morning Father Lord as we woke up this morning and father we realized on the outside it was raining Lord but father we still had joy we still had peace we still had Lord enthusiasm for the things of your word and to be in your house because Lord we're not living in the outer Court we're not even or living in the inner Court father we're the light is controlled by man or controlled by nature but Lord we've stepped into the holies of holy so father if it's cloudy on the outside it's sunny on the inside if it's sunny on the outside it's sunny on the inside it makes no difference Lord because we're living in the presence of the son and Lord You're ripen in this bride you're bringing her father to the potentials and the Perfection Lord that you saw of her from before the foundation of the world and this morning God I pray that you would send the spirit of Revelation in this building father may you open up our hearts this morning Lord to receive these things that you've placed upon our heart I pray Lord you would give us Direction Lord and give us inspiration in your word you see the needs of your children here this morning maybe some not feeling well in body Lord I know you're a Healer maybe some Bound in their spirit I know you're a deliverer Lord whatever the need is I know you're the one to supply the need so father we commit this meeting today into your faithful hands Lord may you come Among Us in a special way we pray a blessing upon our brother and sister Adele this morning Father may you touch their bodies oh God may you the Lord may you visit them today Lord and you may may you comfort them dear God I pray for those that would have a desire to be here but Lord they can't for some reason I pray Lord you envisit them oh God lord may you continue to bless brother Wade bless this assembly father may you continue to use them Lord to spread this gospel and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory let's do your wonderful name the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all all the Believers said a man and amen John the 12th chapter and in the 23rd verse the Bible says here that Jesus answered them saying the hour is come notice this the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified brother Brian said the forming of the body of Jesus Christ now verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit amen it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal and if any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor amen now in verse 25 the Bible there is speaking of life and I believe that is Promised life I'm believe that is the life of God amen amen I believe that's what we're promised or we are heirs to now in the book of Colossians the first chapter Colossians of the first chapter and in the the first verse of Colossians sorry the first chapter of Colossians the ninth verse Paul here writing in Colossians 9 and he says for this cause we also since today we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye may be filled somebody say field that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding notice this that one that now it should be filled with these things but watch the next verse that you might walk worthy of the Lord so you're filled with something then you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful and every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness notice this and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son amen and one other place I want to look is Galatians 4 Galatians 4 and verse 19 you all forgive me this morning for having so many scriptures it's just some things here I've been looking out on my heart and maybe just to read these to give us a background in Galatians 4 and verse 19 Paul again writing says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you now if you skip down to the 27th verse he says for it is written Rejoice thou Barren that bearth not break forth and cry that thou travail us not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath and husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bonds woman and her son for the son of the bonds woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we we could put our joy shoes on right here couldn't we so then brethren we are not the children of the bonds woman but of the free amen we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments I want to speak to you here on a thought and if I would title this this morning I want to speak to you on worthy of the full promise amen worthy of the full promise you know I I believe that we as humans sometimes we we struggle and I believe we struggle sometimes with the thought amen of being worthy are we really worthy am I worthy are you worthy who who is worthy but thank God for sending us a prophet in this generation amen that can actually bring an answer to the question of Are We worthy in the message communion 1963 he said now we know that we are not worthy in ourselves so right there he's just answered it we're not worthy in ourselves none of us are but but that we are not trusting in our own worthiness he said he is worthiness that we have died to our own thinking and we just think his thoughts and live to everything amen that we believe he commands us to and we look back and see where we're living and look our life over then if we're not doing the things that's not worthy of the Gospel amen then we shouldn't take the communion now I believe in communion I believe that we should have it in our churches I believe in a I believe in a natural communion as well as I believe in a spiritual communion I don't believe it meant that we should just have communion once a year or once a month amen or I mean let me rephrase it I don't believe that we should just have communion when the church has communion I believe that there should be a continual communion amen between the Bride of Jesus Christ and her husband the bridegroom amen because he has made her worthy to have fellowship with him now amen I love there in Galatians 4 28 Paul says amen that we now Brethren as Isaac was amen we we are the children of promise now amen the Bible says that children have promised other places the Bible says the children of God now when you break into this children of promised children of God in the Old Testament you'll find that the people of Israel amen were considered the children of Promise amen and they were especially dear to God now in the Old Testament we know Israel amen was considered the the the the people amen who were near to God now in the New Testament in Paul's writing amen we find that all who are led by the spirit of God Amen are thus closely related to God are the children of Promise so in the Old Testament Israel was considered the children of Promise Amen in the New Testament according to Paul's writings amen every child that's led by the spirit of God Amen is considered the children of promise now you all know that there is a natural Israel amen as well as a spiritual Israel and the prophet said it this way he said we are Israelites now think about that we are Israelites because we are the Seed of Abraham now that Israelite is not that which is of the flesh amen but it is that which is of the spirit amen it's not that which is of the flesh amen but it is that which is of the spirit in the book of in the book of Galatians Paul is saying we are amen the children of promise we are Israelites we are we are a spiritual Israel not by flesh amen but by Spirit now in the message Jehovah Jireh 1962 brother Ben said oh I'm so glad to be a Christian how many can can say that this morning I'm so glad to be a Christian he said I wouldn't trade places with nobody in the world not presidents or Kings if they'd give me the whole world said I could live a million years and I wouldn't die after the million years but now a million years amen while that won't be nothing now see just keep on living no death amen but it's great to be a Christian he said we're talking of Abraham he said now let's go back now we are Abraham's seed if we are in Christ Christ and then if you're Abraham's seed you have the same faith that Abraham had because it was his faith that we're talking about amen especially in the church now it's the Royal Seed of Abraham these two seeds of Abraham one of them was the natural Isaac amen and the other one was Christ The Promise amen so Isaac was the natural seed Christ amen was the promise seed amen so that through Isaac Israel would be blessed and through Christ amen he would become the father of Nations so amen the Royal seed how much greater that would be amen than the natural Seed of Abraham so if you are in Christ how many is in Christ amen if you are in Christ you have a supersede amen a super to what Abraham was because you come by the Royal Sea Christ and if you are dead in Christ then are you Abraham's children and you have Abraham's seed in Abraham's faith and Abraham's Faith was in God's word amen regardless of what took place he called those things which were not as though they were amen because God said so what a promise amen then we are the children of Promise amen through the blessing of Jesus Christ now I want to say it to you this way we are not a hybrid church we are not the hybrid seed I believe amen that we are a part of the original seed amen because if we're a hybrid amen then a hybrid germ cannot rise once it goes down when a hybrid germ goes down it's finished amen but watch now if it's an original germ or an original seed amen that seed can go down but it can also raise again amen that's why the blessing of Resurrection is upon your life it's because you are not just a part of the natural seed amen but you are a part of a spiritual seed that has received the promise of Resurrection now when you start talking about promises you got to realize real quick that the promises are not made to just anybody they're not just thrown out there to anybody that wants to come along and believe these promises the promises are made to the seed come on fathers you got children you got seed amen you didn't promise an inheritance to every child in this world Amen but to your seed you have promised an inheritance in the Book of Genesis the 22nd chapter 15th verse the Bible said that the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and if not withheld thy son amen thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply that seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore now watch this and thy seed amen shall possess the Gate of his enemies do you see the Promise now the promises coming to the seed amen thy seed shall be as the stars of the Heaven and the sandwiches upon the seashore thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies verse 18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed amen because thou Hast obeyed my voice remember I'm sitting possessing the gates of the enemy God has been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise amen before he fulfills it and when he said or what he promises so listen amen the only thing that can make you worthy of the Father's Promise is to be a seed of the father who has made the promise concerning you your life listen Church Isaac amen was not of Hagar amen he was of Sarah amen and Hagar was never considered in the promise amen but Sarah was come on now amen that's why the Bible said cast out the bonds woman because her son shall not be Heir with a free woman and I'm going to go ahead and preach since I'm here amen there's no room in the house of God Amen for the bonds woman's ideas there's no room in the house of God Amen for Ishmael worship we are the Freeborn Sons and Daughters of the Living God and if we're going to act like bonds woman children we ought to start thinking like bonds woman's children and we ought to start thinking about judgment we ought to start thinking about tribulation because that's where that seed is headed but there's a free woman seed and her seed is not headed for judgment it's not headed for tribulation I've got a direct quote where the prophet of God said the free woman's children goes in the rapture well somebody shall Hallelujah the free woman's children is going in the rapture ah when you think about this Abraham had been promised that through this seed amen the whole world would be blessed that he would have a son and this son out of him should come forth a seed amen that would bless the whole earth and Abraham when this promise was given 75 years old Sarah 65 amen but the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong given praise to God Amen and God Time After Time amen tested him until he finally come to the final test before the blessing was going to happen he said the final test to see how amen that you will react upon it and when he had give Abraham this test he found that Abraham was just as true as he was when he started amen when the final test come to Abraham to fulfill the promise upon its life amen God found that Abraham was just as worthy at the end as he was at the beginning he found out he was just as faithful amen as though I feel like preaching he was just as faithful at the end as he was at the beginning listen Church there's a bride on this Earth amen and she's not a denominational hybrid she is a part of that original life she's a part of that Original Seed and what she was in the beginning is what she won't be in the ending and if she was faithful in the beginning she will be faithful in the if she was holy in the beginning she will be holy in the end listen there's a bride on the Earth today who will be found worthy to receive the Fulfillment of every Divine promise not based upon your worthiness not based upon my worthiness but based upon him who hath made us worthy now the Bible says in Galatians 3 16. now to Abraham and his seed amen were the promises made he hath not said and to seeds as a man but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ now in the message the feet is not here with the shark he said hear the seed won one seed Not seeds but one seed these others were not Seed of Abraham because Abraham's seed was his faith seed that God was speaking of not his natural seed amen because after Sarah died Abraham married another woman and had seven sons besides daughters so it wouldn't be Abraham's seeds it was Abraham's seed one and it was Abraham's Faith seed amen which was pointing to the Royal seed that was to come through Abraham's Faith amen not Abraham's Natural Life Abraham's spiritual life who took everything contrary to God's word and called it as though it was not and believed God against hope believe that hope that's the real seed amen that we're speaking of Amen so through Abraham's Faith would come of Faith seed which would be a royal seed and the prophet in the seed is not air with a shack will call this bride amen the Royal seed bride whoa brother you are the Royal seed bride and the prophet of God will sing rise in the sun he'll say there's been churches churches there's been Brides brides churches Brides brides but there has got to come one amen that has to become a real bride there must be one that God only got the mechanics amen but the Dynamics of it that makes the church live and move in the power of his resurrection paragraph 111 and is he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others that spoke of the Bride it can only manifest and if it does something different from the groom then it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh she is bone of his bone life of his life power this power she he is him come on church amen the alpha has become the Omega amen what was in the beginning is now in the ending amen she is him now the prophet says there's a man and woman or one woman take from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife amen the spirit of him and the Flesh of him put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics now I've been preaching you know I've been preaching long enough to run into some interesting things and I remember one time I was preaching in church and I was preaching on the Dynamics of the fire of God the Holy Ghost as soon as I got done met some guy at the back door and you know how it is preach a heart out and there's always that one person you know and then I met him at the back door and he said you know what brother he said you're in the wrong Church to preach this I said what do you mean he said we're not a Dynamics Church we're a mechanics church I said oh so you're not going in the rapture now you say well you're pretty bold well the prophet of God said it's going to take the mechanics and the Dynamics then you get some people now come on Church you get some people and all they want is Dynamics and no mechanics and what you get is you get two ditches and you get a bunch of people trying to preach out of the ditch and can't nobody stay in the middle of the road amen but I believe that there's a bride who is not in a mechanics ditch and she's not in a dynamic Stitch but she's in the middle of the road that Isaiah said there will be a highway and there'll be a way and it'll be called the way of Holiness and I believe there's a bride who is walking in the middle of the road manifesting the mechanics because the Dynamics have struck the mechanics all right what are you saying I'm saying this bride is not just sitting around quoting quotes and fussing an arrogant and debating and trying to break down words and neither is she running all over the building with a bunch of smoke and no fire in the engine amen but I believe this bride isn't most powerful force of people that is on the face of the Earth Amen to declare the mechanics of the word of God with a manifestation of the same dynamics that fell in the upper room has fallen in the Church of the Living God and is manifesting come on Church you all know the quote if he fired on 16 cylinders she'll fire on 16 cylinders too ain't just a bunch of mechanics this ain't just a bunch of Dynamics it's the mechanics and the Dynamics coming together it's the Bride of Jesus Christ who has been given the greatest privileges is to Bow our heads Amen to Humble ourself to reverence the mechanics amen but to open up our hearts to the Living God Amen to bring a living Christ into a dying generation listen friends our young people need more than a bunch of mechanics they need more than a bunch of arguing over quotes they need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost they meant to burn with fire and reality and strength in their lives now you say preacher you sure are saying right Dynamics I am because this is ride time this is bright time Revelation 1 3 the Bible says it very plain blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein why for the time is at hand now the prophet of God says that time is at hand he said the time amen was not previously in the wisdom and economy of God this Mighty Revelation so this is not some little something this is a mighty Revelation though fully known to God could not cut forth hitherto thus we immediately learn a principle that the revelation of God can only come in the age and at a specific time see look at Israel look at Jesus he said and in this age of laodicea the revelation of God will come in it's due time it will not falter and neither will it be premature the revelation of God will not come in a premature season it will not come in a way that will cause you falter this revelation will come at the appointed time now the word revelation 1 3 says the time is at hand I love that word time brother brother Wade that word time means opportunity it means a fixed and definite time it is the time when things are brought to a crisis so when the time is at hand it's the opportunity it's the time when things have come to a crisis and the prophet said oh Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities that Saint Paul never dreamed of having we have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and all of them never had the opportunities that we have now you say preacher why can you announce to the church that we have opportunities because this is the hour of the fullness of all things this is the hour when the cup of iniquity is becoming full this is the hour When sin has become the fullness of this nation this is the hour when religion has reached the fullness of church eternity but it's also at the time when the bride has stepped down of the confusion of denomination and she's in the fullness of the revelation of the full word with full power with full strength with full Authority with full healing with full blessings with full faith with full Grace with full Mercy with full anointing come on Church you have been tried by the word and you have been found worthy to receive the fullness of the promise of God in the age that you're living in Romans 15 29 says it beautiful amen I am sure that when I come unto you I shall come in the fullness of the blessing we are here this morning in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ in Ephesians 1 10 Paul again says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ are you ready both which are in heaven and which are on the earth notice where we're being gathered even in him in Ephesians 3 19 and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that she might be filled with all the fullness of God look at this word fullness that which is has been filled amen notice that which feels or which a thing is filled of those things which a ship is filled amen it is the fullness it is the abundance I love this one brother brother Wade it's a keeping so whatever the church is filled with is what's keeping her whatever the church is full of is her keeping power it's her sustaining power listen and I'll say this we are not like denominations who is satisfied amen with halfway intellectual conversions we are not hybrids that are satisfied but just partial understanding but we have received a more sure word of Prophecy from a son of man who is revealing be sin of man and you know what he said he said all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he has poured into the church listen not half of what was in God was poured into Christ and half of what was in Christ was poured in the church but all the fullness everything that was in God he poured into Christ and everything that's in Christ has been poured hell church if we're living like a bachelor about your peasants and about your slaves we're living underneath our privileges if we're sitting here trying to get good enough Amen to work something out of God and to make something we're never going to get nothing the way we get something is recognize what he's done for us all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the church see that's why Paul said amen that in him do Ever Fall the fullness of the god head bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power ye are complete in Christ I love what the prophet said he said these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God or the predestinated for known of God and we're in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decree season and as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body oh don't you love this thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed right thus this bride is the literal spoken word Saint bride then tell me Church unto whom was the promises given the promises were given to the seed and Church of the Living God you are the literal spoken word seat right then the promises of the new Abraham has been given unto this bride and though she is in feminine designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that shall be called that now why because she was predestinated in him she came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now amen manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once amen God was manifested in one member even our lord Jesus let me say this I say thank God for a prophet who came and stood in the face of Pentecostalism and preached the predestination of the Bible he preached the predestinated seed of all my God is in the heart of every bride member by the foreknowledge of God manifesting God in the fullness of his body in the fullness of his godhead you know I just said to you like this maybe just drop this into you amen I say thank God that we got a six-hour tape called spoken word is the Original Seed and if you go study that tape you're going to find that that is the first time from 47 to 65 that the prophet brings the two words together predestinated and Seed he'll say predestinated predestination he'll say seed for knowledge but in 1962 he brings the two together and then makes an identification and says and you are a predestinated seed amen just like Christ was somebody said well amen that's hard to preach well if you study spoken word it's the Original Seed he does say in the first half that the word is a seed in the first half of that sermon word seed but in the second half he begins to preach predestinated to receive the word see listen church amen the devil shouldn't be running you around like a hopeless helpless church member you ought to get some grit about you and recognize that you are a part of the seed of almighty God and there's a promise upon your life the spirit of God is here Amen to lead you into the full promise because you are worthy of it the spirit of God is here to lead you into the full promise because you're the only people on the face of the earth that is worthy to receive the fullness of the promise of God listen church as I was with Moses so will I be with thee see why Joshua had to take this command let God be with you as he was with Moses and will know that the same spirit that led us this far can take us on Amen I love I love that tape because I love how the prophet says with all the failures of Moses god stayed with him you won't talk about worthiness us about it brother Bob imagine being Joshua and realizing that the commission has now come upon your life to lead these people into the promised land that God promised Moses but Moses didn't take him there you've got to take him and imagine looking at yourself in the mirror like Joshua did and realizing all your failures and all your faults and how unworthy you are and how there's nothing worthy about you but then all of a sudden you begin to remember well Moses made mistakes but God stayed with him Moses failed but God stayed with him and then the Revelation breaks out in your heart that as I was with Moses so will I be with you well come on church amen if God was with the prophet he will also be with a prophecy and brother Branham had failures brother Brandon was a human but I put my life on this statement God was with him and if God was with him then God is with this bride amen as I was with Moses I that's how it works with William Branham so will I be with this Joshua generation who's anointed and sound worthy to take every promise in the land oh somebody ought to shout hallelujah as I was with Moses so would I be with you as I was with the prophet so will I be with the prophecy oh have a church all this morning he says to look and Define the spirit working among the people if you want a church home where the spirit that raised Christ from the dead the Holy Spirit that'll move amongst the people that's the spirit of God that's raising up in the last days to take the people over into the other land are you ready for this into the full promise of all the blessings of God to the full commission that he gave or promise God called ministers all not to be stuffed out with theology but have a visit the land to where we're going come on if you're going to be a leader at least go and tell us what's in the land come on if you come on now and then you ain't gonna pay two thousand dollars for a guide to take you on a Colorado hunt and he's lived in Chicago his whole life amen you want somebody who's been in the mountains you want somebody that knows the trails you want somebody that has some evidence that there's some elk here there's some elk sign here well I say thank God that he didn't leave us with a Joel Osteen he didn't leave us with the TD Jakes but he left us with a Vindicated Prophet amen who've been in the land who went beyond the curtain of time and he brought back Heaven into the land and he said listen I've been there I feel like preaching right now he said I've been there and you know what I love about it brother Bob he records everything he's seen but the but but what what puts my feet to shouted is when he said I saw you there oh Church of the Living God that tells me that a prophet saw a bride who was not worthy based on her own worthiness but she was made worthy based on the blood and she was seen in the land of promise thank you bring back the evidence of divine love and the power of Jesus Christ to make known to their congregations that there is a land beyond the river that's why we're not Kingdom Builders that's why we're not focused on us and here and what can be done for us we're trying to get you out of this Kingdom we're trying to get you listen this world is falling apart you gotta get somewhere where the city that has foundations you got to get somewhere where there's a place that time will not corrupt it that perversion will not corrupt it and there's only one place we can go that's to the New Jerusalem listen then God wants his seed to come in to the full value of the promised land now I tell you what the world wants the world wants mixers but you'll never as the seed of God takes the promise of God as a mixer because God wants separators see what does God do according to Deuteronomy 7 God separates his people from the world to bring them into a complete identity as a believer in Deuteronomy 6 6 the Bible says Thou Art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord that God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you Lord chose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all the people brother the most unworthy Bunch was the worth was the bunch who had been made worthy listen you're a chosen people now I'm about to borrow something from my pastor if that's okay amen I know sometimes that that preachers get up and because they don't study their okay well I might as well preach amen takes too much effort to study so they just get up because they don't want to study and say well I'm not a study or I'm not a revelation preacher I'm just going to preach my inspiration I'm just going to preach about whatever comes to mind well let me just say this we're not really interested in whatever comes to your mind we have a filter and it's the word of God it's the message of the hour [Applause] filter your mind to this message before you come the pulpit without anything to say oh God I'm gonna get in trouble sure but what happens brother brother Zach is they come to pulpit and they ain't got nothing to say and because they ain't got nothing to say nobody's saying amen and so because nobody's saying amen it turns from a sermon to a lashing and they begin to beat God's people because they're not hollering amen well we ain't going to say Amen when you ain't got nothing to say Amen to well I'm not a politician I'm a preacher if you want us to say Amen preach the message because we're Egos and that's the only thing we can say Amen to so when it turns into a lashing then all of a sudden message people become a bunch of stiff-necks 30 people you know they're too arrogant they're too haughty I'm gonna borrow your saying for my pastor quit beating up the message people and calling them arrogant and stiff-necked and haughty and stuck up no we're not arrogant we're not stiff neck we're not stuck up we're just not vulnerable no more say we used we used to be vulnerable soon and everything that comes through we followed it but but now we're found out by the preacher the message that we are worthy by the blood to believe the promise to the Seed of Abraham so we don't have to follow everybody's dream or follow everybody's Vision or so and so woke up and had a funny feeling do you realize how many how many how many funny feelings we have every day amen if we preach based on feelings amen he'd be up one day and down the next but this bride is not led by feelings she's not led by visions she's not led by dreams she's not led by words of knowledge and prophecies amen she's led by the saith the Lord through the face of Abraham by the message that restored Abraham's Faith to the Royal seat bride now we're not about your stuff people we're not about your starchy arrogant people we're just not vulnerable to everything that comes along well somebody shout amen out showed my knee or something we got an absolute we got a direction we got a Vindicated message and we're staking our lives on it because it's been Vindicated by God himself now you say preacher you're getting powerful am I really though because if you're going to come in the good land you're going to come in by God's provided way and the only way into the land is by Grace the problem of God said it'll take Grace to keep the family of Jehovah together now listen what is this message it's the message of Grace do you know what the Bible says the Bible says that we would not turn the grace of God into lasciviousness the Bible also says that we would not we would not move into Grace and then let sin abound do you see what this message is this message separated you from the denominational interpretation of Grace to give you an identity to be the real Lady of Grace according to the word of God you say preacher can you prove that well I can it's in the first seal in John the 12th chapter the prophet of God said now watch he said we're going to read John 12 and then you won't have to wonder no more what this thunder is amen don't you love that when a prophet says we're going to read it we're going to preach it and when we get done you ain't gonna have to wonder no more he reads John 12 and says the hour has come that the son of man shall be glorified he said see you're at the end of an age here his ministry is ending so when you come to the end you got to do something you got to go somewhere you can't just stay at the end see now watch the hour has come that the son of man shall be glorified he said what about the Hours come that the bride must be taken away oh that's preaching material right there when you come to the end it's the hour that the bride must be taken away he said what about the Hours come but time shall be no more he said the angel is ready to set one foot on land and the other on sea where the rainbow over his head with his feet and say time has run out and besides that he has raised up his hand and swore that time would be no more when this happened how perfect it is it's a sworn affidavit to the church oh my when this seal is broke he said now when the lamb took the book and broke the first seal amen God spoke from his eternal Throne to say what the symbol was to be revealed so its symbol and then it goes to revealed right when it's placed before John it was in a symbol when John saw it was still a mystery why it wasn't even revealed man because it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time listen the symbol cannot be revealed until there's a people on the Earth that's been found worthy to receive the revelation of the seal that's been revealed it oh God help me Lord Jesus if the lamb had to be worthy if the only one that could take the book and loosed to seals had to be film worthy then you better believe the people that would receive what the lamb was revealing had to be found worthy too and the whole God and the same lamb who opened the seals is the same lamb that bled and died for you to put you in position to make you worthy to receive the revelation of the entire Mysteries of the Bible in the age that you're living in I'm about to explode up here I'm not talking about psychology I'm not talking about education I'm talking about the blood that's made you Worthy the blood has made you worthy to receive the revelation of the word in the age you're living time is run out church we cannot stay here brother Aaron we gotta go somewhere so the Lamb made us worthy to receive the revelation of the word of God to put us into Rapture condition who brother when that Thunder when that Thunder thundered he said remember a loud clapping noise of a thunderous the voice of God somebody says well let's break the Thunders down no let's say what a prophet said it's the voice of God well you say preacher you're dumb you're exactly right I'm dumb enough to say what a prophet said what the Bible said it's a clap of Thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him see it was a thunder and notice the first seal when it was opened in December form it thundered now what happened when it's open in its reality form it thundered in its symbol form then it'll be open in its reality form Church of the Living God if it thundered in its symbol form it's going to thunder in its reality form and God sent a prophet to Jeffersonville to speak over that church and say what we need is a thousand live voices Amen to thunder out amen the life of Jesus Christ church I'm telling you this morning it's time to go home it's time to quit looking for something it's time to recognize what has been released and revealed and put in your possession to take you out of this age into the Millennium of Jesus Christ it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back that seal and what did it reveal now watch this not all of itself first is with God next it's in symbol then it's revealed three things it comes from God to symbol to revelation comes from God to symbol to Revelation product God said from Revelation to reality now come on it's coming forth from the throne it cannot be seen it cannot be heard or nothing it's sealed up the Lamb's blood paid the price it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out see and it still was a symbol it still was a symbol now watch this from God to symbol to Revelation Revelation brings it to reality from God to symbol to Revelation Revelation brings you to reality now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it Church come forth in a symbol of a church that they know there's a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and it's only to be revealed at the last day when this axle seal is broken to who not to Christ but to the church come on God is known to seal all along but when John saw the symbol of it he did not receive the revelation of it although when God showed him the symbol is this okay when God showed him the symbol amen he already had the Revelation in the back part of his mind when he give John the symbol of a white horse rider when John wrote it he wrote it under symbol but in 1963 when a prophet stood behind the pulpit he had been in the back part of God's mind and the mind of God was in the prophet of God and he's no longer preaching symbols he's no longer just preaching it's a white horse rider and that white horse riders cries he has now picked up the reality of the revelation of the symbol and he's putting a bride in position to whip that devil Hallelujah Church you may think I'm crazy but at least I'm free you have been put in position to whip the Devils from laodicea by the revelation come on young people quit sitting around with your head tucked between your legs and you're ashamed to be a part of this message lift up your head this message has finally put a youth in the position to defeat the Devil [Applause] this message ain't just some book or tape this ain't just some little shout hallelujah Camp time this is the power of God and the Salvation it's a revelation to whip two hundred thousand thousand devils God had the Revelation all along John received it in symbol but William Branham preached the revelation of it can I preach to you now but before he preached the Revelation he changed your identity amen I don't know if you can give me any more in my ear but I'd appreciate it amen before before he preached it he had to receive the revelation of it but before he give you the revelation of it he changed your identity changed our identity by the way yes he said I hope you catch this I'm going to call you Brad I'm going to call you bruh I'm no longer going to call you church I'm going to call you Brad so that you'll understand so he was not just calling you bride to make you all puffed up well I'm the bride I'm the bride he was calling you the bride show the understanding of the revelation of the word of God could rest upon your life and you would be made worthy by the revelation I'm on church and then a prophet stood there and set the first seal is the white horse rider and he said the white horse rider is none other than the devil which is the Antichrist and he said now we all know as Christians that God swore to David that he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne and give him an everlasting kingdom here on the earth he did it and Jesus said he that overcomes the Antichrist and all it's okay and all the things of the world shall set with me on my throne even as I overcome and have set down on my father's Throne do you see sister June what puts you in position to sit on the father's throne and overcome the Antichrist overcome the world overcome the mark of the beast overcome his number overcome his identity it's the revelation of the blood of Jesus Christ that has purified you we are not being made worthy we are worthy by the blood of the lamb and the word of God and the revelation of Jesus Christ that is sitting upon this church somebody shout hallelujah I'm about to explode right now we're not going to be overcome by the Antichrist we have been put in position to overcome the Antichrist somebody shot the bride the bride say it like you got some attitude the bride overcomes the Antichrist the and you felt that didn't you sis the Overcomer is not the Antichrist the Overcomer is the bride and who is the bride you are the bride and who will sit with him in his throne is the bride who's been made Worthy you say preacher how are we going to overcome the Antichrist by the revelation of Jesus Christ we're going to overcome the Revelation overcome the Antichrist by the revelation of Jesus Christ it's a revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil it's the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take away from this word would be cursed would have to be for who can add or take away are you ready for this from the perfect revelation it's not an imperfect revelation it's a perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy you cannot oh God you cannot tamper with the revelation of Jesus Christ and overcome the Antichrist you cannot sit down and run it through the halls of the Baptist Seminary and the halls of the Pentecostal Seminary when you run it through those seminaries you are diluting the perfect Revelation with a with a water of denomination and I say God forbid that we ever lay this message on the table of denomination and subject this message to what some Baptist taught or some idea of the Catholic we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and this message is the perfect Superior Revelation above all that the world has can I say it like the prophet said he said there is no such Force there is no such prevailing power as the revelation of the word man running from the presence of the Lord he sent many here tonight Lord will be here here that's confused on those subjects that's vital oh God open that fountain in the house of God that's for cleansing us I pray God that you'll wash us and cleanse Us in thy blood and make us new creatures are you ready for this and give us Grace and give us Grace and strength to bring forth the word of Truth in its divine revelation of the being of Jesus Christ that's a mouthful right there we got to have Grace Church and we're going to have strength to bring forth the divine revelation of the being of Jesus Christ I don't have time to preach on it but let me just give you a few seconds of it this message is the Revival of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ in the church this message is not the Revival of brother Branham it's not the Revival of Jeffersonville this message is the Revival of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ where can you find the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ in the Bible you can find in Revelation 1 verse 8 when he said I am the Alpha and the Omega I am the first and the last I am he that was and he is and shall be he says what is that that's the greatest of all Revelations is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ then he goes from Revelation 1 8 to Revelation 3 8 and says there'll be an Open Door what is the open door it's the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ made manifest In the Flesh of the bride and the Bible says Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Spoken Word Church I'm preaching to you this morning the Devil May throw a lot against you the devil may throw a lot against this ministry but you have been Anointed with the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ then what did my challenge you to do get up off your pity party get up off your ass Heap and get on the horse of the word and get a sword in your hand and ride that devil down and defeat that Devil by the revelation of the word of God not a crazy man I've been anointed by the grace of God to bring forth to bring forth come on Brother come on sister you know what bring him forth means it's speaking of birth I feel good bringing forth is speaking of birth now if you go to the book of Isaiah 37 the Bible said the day is a day of trouble psalms 27 says it'll be a day in a day of trouble in a time of trouble is the background for the Rapture he said unto they have trouble of rebuke of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there's not strengths to bring forth the children the seed has come to the birth but there's no strength to bring forth John 16 20 verily verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour is come oh I wish I was a preacher right now The Hours come John 12 Revelation 1 3 the time is at hand are you hearing me and right here Jesus says when The Hours come amen as soon as she has delivered to the child she remembersth no more of the anguish for joy that a man is born in the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you brother band preaches an entire sermon from that scripture and calls it birth pains he says now I believe that Jesus here was speaking of you will have sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned to Joy speaking to his disciples here knowing that the birth of Christianity was coming into existence now can I preach to you the old has to die in order that the new is born to have anything that gives birth has to have Pains of distress and they certainly was going to go through the pain of distress and anguish to get away from the law unto Grace So this birth is birthing us out of the law which makes you unworthy into the grace of God come on if you try to live by law you won't ever come to church if you try to live by law you won't ever raise your hands you won't ever enjoy the presence of God but if you ever get underneath a spout where the glory of the grace of God Is Us right now you will move amen from the legalistic bondage of law into the message of Grace and you will walk with favor you will walk with anointing you will walk with a power upon your life that you know I'm unworthy by the law but is Grace his grace among Church his grace has made do you realize we ought to be brothers act sitting in a Baptist church this morning preaching that the Antichrist or rather the white horse rider is Christ but Grace made a place in the body of Jesus Christ underneath the headstone Ministry of cerebral Amen to put a bride in position to walk [Music] if I'm on church quit reading about it and start walking in it start walking in the revelation of the son of man start walking in the revelation of the seventh seal start walking in the blessing of the third pool when brother Brandon preaches is he's tapping a natural birth with a spiritual birth and he said now a genuine New Birth will not produce a steel birth he said now watch what's going to happen is the old must die in order to bring forth the new that's the same thing with the new birth we never go back we go forward when you're born again he said genuine New Birth is because the seed is well maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from that Old system that they were in can I have a few more minutes now watch this he said they still want to cling on to it but they knew the old system is dead but they just don't want to go out of it see now rot is when it's really done away with when a claim is made that they are newborn but a claim is only a begotten sign see rotten brings forth a new New Birth you've got to run away from it just as we did in all ages to the west and all fourth now watch them will drop down they had to come out of it run away from it to accept the new birth if they were going to be found worthy of the full promise of God they had to they did not just have to acknowledge the old was dead but they had to have strength to be pushed out of the old into the new they had to come out of it somebody say out of it rot away from it to accept the new birth now come on church because the prophet of God teaches you what the new birth is in Christ the mystery he said what is the new birth in you say well brother Branham it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation then can I say this you are the walk and talk and breathe and live and manifested revelation of the opening of the word in the age that you're living in what is it is Christ the Bible he is the word and was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon listen Church Without this message brother Bob we did not even have a clear biblical understanding of what the new birth is but when a Prophet come on the scene he began to declare New Birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now I'm going somewhere because he says it very beautiful in the church age book he said we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seen is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there's nothing to click without a king seed of almighty God you are unworthy you are unthought of you are pushed out of the economy of God when it comes to Rapture but if there's a seed in your soul well I feel like shouting right now if there's a seed in your soul your body may be against you but it's not greater than the seed that's in you that seed has brought your body subject to the birth of the Rapture it'll change this body in the moment in the twinkling of an eye what are you saying preacher I'm saying the seed goes on the seed don't stay in the old it goes on see the seed goes forward can I preach to you the seed goes forward Moses could not have brought Noah's message neither could Jesus brought Noah's message because it was another age and the old seed was right come on don't don't get in your mind and we're just knocking lutherans and knocking wastelands and knocking Pentecostals the seed was right the old seed was right brother but the prophet said it served its purpose and was dead and gone on the transformation from the old to the new now do you know why you got to transfer from the old to the new you've got to be where the life come on now where the life was at was what was worrying the people is what worries them yet today now come on if your weird life is and there's an anointing brother Bob to birth and move forward there's always an element of insecurity or Scare because you know there's life there come on remember I'm talking about a baby he said that baby has gotten so used to that womb he said he's got meals a day warm comfort of a mother that he's almost worried he's almost scared to leave the womb but if he's ever going to live if he's ever going to manifest the full potentials of a human being he's got to leave the womb he's going to leave the womb and he's going to move to where life was not at but where life is come on church can I say this as plain as I know how we cannot we cannot we cannot stay where life was we must advance to where life is now I got a message for it I've got the countdown the horse and buggy made way for the automobile and the automobile made way for the airplane and the airplane made way for the astronaut come on do you realize what happens though when one steps out of the familiar into the new amen they automatically become an oddball so because nobody wants to be a spectacle nobody wants to be an oddball they try to stay where the old was and they die because the life is moving now come on y'all go to Amish country no offense to our Amish friends but y'all go to Amish country and they're still riding horse and Buggies come on and you talk to the people and there's all kinds of accidents and there's all and there's all kinds of deaths every year because they're they're competing with Speedways and highways of 90 miles an hour in a horse and buggy that only preached the just shall live by faith well come on amen that's why they quit going to meetings because they're still hung up and God sent a prophet but there's a bride who has moved into the revelation of what a prophet taught and so because we're not still sitting around the campfire telling stories when brother Branham was hunting and all of a sudden we're not spiritual no we are the spiritual Israel because we have advanced come on Church what God did to Abraham he did to his seed after him this bride is not staying in 1906 she's not staying and God sent a prophet she's not staying and hunting stories she's not standing brother Brandon was my buddy she has moved into the revelation of the manifestation of her complete identity in Jesus Christ the churches have got so systematic he said so they're afraid they're afraid to become an oddball he said but those who Advance will automatically I'm paraphrasing automatically become odd to the previous until it's accepted hahaha now that now that's where you got to stand and I want to say I I just want to take this opportunity this morning to say God bless our brother Dale God bless our brother Sam Dale God bless our brother Ed biscals God bless our men of God God bless these God bless these men of God in that generation amen that had to advance amen out of friendships and out of circles to stand and declare that there's more to this thing than just wearing a belt buckle there's more to this thing than just carrying a briefcase there's a laugh there's a power there's an anointing there's a not in the tire behind this message so what did they do they had to bring forth they had to step out and they had to stand there and be made fun of and laughed at ridiculed and well they're just trying to beat something and they're just trying to teach something more than somebody else they're just trying to be a theologian no they're trying to bring a people to the knowledge that they're not going to get worthy they're already Worthy it's all odd till it's accepted then when it's accepted everybody blazes the trail you know I'm gonna get in trouble it sure is the world when it's accepted everybody was a part of it you know I mean come on you say something odd going on and say something about it and you're the Oddball but when everybody sees it oh I saw something I knew there was always a little something yeah well why didn't you quit being a yellow back collar and take a stand when you saw it hello somebody you didn't hire me so you can't fire me quit being a coward with this message and get a backbone and step out in the revelation of what the seventh angel taught now you all know I'm telling the truth it's odd till it's accepted it's odd to live I'm on church it's odd till everybody's got one remember cell phones they were odd they were odd brother they were until now everybody's got one and what's funny is the ones that said they were odd are the ones now that's got the best one they got out yeah you know why because it's a day I'm gonna close on this point and today when you got to recognize you're worthy to move into the promises you've got to get rid of this mentality I gotta get Worthy I gotta listen to enough tapes I gotta read enough books I gotta attend enough meetings you gotta recognize that he has made you Worthy brother said it very plain he says now watch in this last day paraphrasing in this last day he said fear not little flock there's only there's only going to be a few but it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom now watch this the program of God will always be in the minority are you with me on that point but in this program in 1959 in this faith that we're now preaching and earnestly contending for don't you move one inch from it for if you believe me to be his servant this is the program of God it'll never be in the majority it'll always be in the minority always has and always will be but remember fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom then what are you saying preacher I'm saying the minority is going to be an elected few who have been predestinated unto adoption come on Church they've been predestinated to be more than just born they've been predestinated to take a position see and God has identified the people who is worthy of the full promise now let me say it to you like this can I can I have just a few more minutes be elect of each age that pressures the battle the elect seed from the beginning until now moves closer and closer to the fullness until finally they are the fullness Jesus says Revelation 3 4 he said thou Hast a few names which are people even Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy they are worthy now the prophet of God says these people were the true saints of God we're walking all pleasing unto the Lord their garments were clean you see in those days the garments would sleep along the road and pick up the dirt and defilement these were watching how they walked so that they were not corrupted by the world they were in the spirit and walk in the spirit they were holy and Without Blame before him thus they were fulfilling their purpose for what is what Ephesians 1 4 says is the purpose of God for us that we should to be holy and Without Blame if they were willing to walk with him through tolls and snares of life and be an honor to him he was going to reward them listen church and now Jesus stands there and says these words for they are worthy I know what you're saying you're saying that's just sardisian church age brother Andrew I'm not a part of that but do you realize that how can overcome the prophet of God said the last Church age gets all the rewards plus the reward of their age so in this last Church age you get the blessing of oh God he says they are worthy do you realize who is saying this it is Jesus the worthy one only himself this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits upon the throne and now this worthy one is saying to his Saints you are worthy the worthy one when they search the heavens brothers act they search the Earth they searched underneath the Earth and could not find one worthy but then the lamb comes forth and he was found worthy and he took the book and he broke in the seals and he released it to the center of Angel and the seventh angel priesthood to the bride and now the same one who opened the book is now turning to the ones who are eating the book who are possessing the promises and says you are worthy you are worthy here is this one the only one qualified to judge and indeed all judgment is committed to him and he says brother Michael he says he says you are worthy brother Bob he says hey Brother Anderson so I don't care what they said he says sister June you're not worthy so-and-so said don't care what they said he said come on church I feel like preaching I think it's time to take what he said and punch that devil right Square in the face I don't care what you're saying I don't care what your buddy said I don't care what your friend says I only care about what's the one who is worthy to say something and he said he said he said I am worthy who shall lay anything then to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies but remember said these words are astounding as are the words in Romans 8 33 God says I am righteous way translation there in the white light oh God that's a powerful point in the brother Wayne right there in the white light of God's righteousness hear the sweet voice of Jesus as he says these are mine they are righteous they are worthy and they shall walk with me in white I don't have time to get into it but I'll just give you a quick reference of it Matthew 24 Luke 21 gives two separate accounts right of Jesus prophecy concerning the end time in there you'll find that Israel is represented as the symbolic fig tree you will find the Matthew 24 Jesus was asked three questions in Matthew 24 verse 2 write the scripture down read them later Matthew 24 2 Jesus is speaking here of the destruction of Jerusalem and in Matthew 24 14 and 15 he speaks of the Abomination y'all are well taught that cause desolation which you know what that was it was the rejection of the Messiah and from that time from that time there has never been a more persecuted people than the Jewish race but you come down the 21st verse for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor even nor ever shall be verse 22 and accept those days shall be shortened there should be no flesh saith but for the elect's sake for for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened listen Church the Jews have been a persecuted people for the past two thousand years because of their rejection of the Messiah for the elect's sake he's speaking of the 144 000 which Revelation 11 right the two prophets will go back to the hundred forty four thousand and then they will come under they will come back under amen the power of redemption this Jewish tribulation that has been upon the Jews is different from the tribulation it'll be sent down from God upon the Earth that will be the wrath of God but you move from Matthew 24 and you go to Luke 21 verse 36 in church this is my this is my closing point my shouting point right out of here watching therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man oh church if you are a part of that Gene seed of God if you're a part of the Plan of Redemption if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life who the lamb alone was worthy to reveal if your name is in that book then the same lamb who ripped off the seals is the same lamb who broke the sin and trespass that was dictating your life and said you are worthy somebody raise your hands and say I'm worthy I'm worthy I'm worthy to escape I have been brother Bob accounted worthy to escape preacher what are you saying I'm saying the rapture the Rapture is the escape and the Rapture tape is only brother remember show The Rapture is only for the elect as our musicians are coming listen we say about Satan's big machine up there ready to move that's right to crush down but remember remember God's Little Flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready too it's ready for the Dynamics to set it a fire with the Holy Ghost fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom the Holy Ghost will strike a little church brother the Holy Ghost will strike a little church that's come out from the world women that wears long-haired Nazarite to prove that they've separated themselves Nazareth is one who what a one that separates himself for the word of God not short wear and painted face Jezebel's calling themselves Christians no sir man so wishy-washy he'll stand for denomination hold on their coat tale of some Caesar Herod instead of standing on the word of God but God has got a loyal people a genuine flock of God who don't care what the world says they believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever are you ready for this church are you ready for this program says all is written in the book will escape it I don't know about y'all but that makes me want to get out in the field somewhere and cut up for about an hour the wrath of God is hanging over this nation you're feeling the hot Winds of judgment right now blowing its poisonous breath Upon This Nation but there's a bride there is a bride who has been found worthy she's been found worthy to escape it remember so we found out that little flock is ready for the Dynamics to move it up into the skies to escape all this tribulation what are you saying preacher watch the separation Matthew 25 10 versions Five Wives five foolish but remember said watch those foolish virgins working paraphrasing washing garments but the bride is granted fine linen you know what that you know what that word granted means to give one to to give one to someone to whom he already belonged [Music] the mind of God you always was his so Jesus come that all that belong to the father might be given back to him church it's almost overwhelming the world's falling apart the brother Joe we've been found worthy we've been accounted Worthy to escape this this tribulation once you stand to your feet this morning remember said what is sin sinned and what the word of the word of God bam said you pure and adulterated oh Hallelujah I love this one here you pure unadulterated leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready standing ready standing ready Church you're not going through the persecution the blood of Jesus Christ has perfected this bride I read a quote this morning brother bam said oh he said Lord may we come under the shed blood that made us Worthy so we can be ready to go up in the rapture I thought brother brother Wade under the blood ready to go up ready to go up because we're under the blood how many can say this morning Lord I want to start

corrected and the spirit of wisdom and knowledge would bring an understanding by the word into the church these are the people Lord this is your seed Lord this is that Royal seat bride that you saw in the back part of your mind this is the seed bride that you saw fathers standing here today worthy of the full promise father the stalk has given way to the tassel the tassel has given way to the husk and that Lord the husk has given way to the seed Lord the prophet of God tracked that seed right through all stages he said it was a life moving through those stages until father that seed would bring forth and the seed is the life itself and Lord there's a bride here this morning it's manifesting the life of Jesus Christ they're manifesting the seed of the word of God every Divine promise lord

thoughts of being worthy I pray today o God that you would break the chains of confusion over their mind Lord you would bring such a peace in their heart that they could see Lord they could see that

he is worthy to be praised he is worthy to be honored can I say to you like this you're a blessed people [Music] you're in a world full of deception the world is fully deceived and found worthy Worthy worthy not to be deceived worthy to walk in the Revelation y'all I share this with you and I'll turn it over to brother Wade y'all probably remember some of you I was actually back before I was even born so I know some of you would remember in 1993 the Waco Texas uh Siege there the David koresh the whole uh Branch Davidians things government whatever we're not going into all that but the other day we was on our way down there we met brother Timothy Pruitt and his wife and daughter out there and spent a few days and on the way down there I'd always heard brother Sean preach you know and he'd mentioned he'd say we ain't falling to Jim Jones or David correction I never even looking at guys I looked him up got to watch a little bit of documentary on him he's riding down the road I was listening to it and and while I'm listening to it brother Bobby something just jumped out at me it said he believed he was the Lamb of Revelation 5 that was worthy to open the seals my wife's probably got a little man in the nursery but now she is asleep ran down the road and I woke her up and I said you ain't gonna believe what this guy so we get down there and I told Timothy if he's listening God bless you he said I don't want to go over that's that's strange well let's go over let's just let's just go see it you know so we go over spirit I mean you literally feel the spirits hanging around the place we walk in the church the only thing left of all the compound everything burnt down they build a little churches and museums we walked in there and there's a guy standing behind there and he goes oh uh are you all of any religious background and brother Timothy said yeah he looked at me and I said yeah he said oh what background I said well we're non-denominational you know I just want to throw it out there and see where we went well I found out right quick that just because we had a little bit of religious background he was ready to talk I mean you ever met them guys that talk and you can't get a word in edgewise I mean that he is telling us more we wanted to know you know so he finally got done I said well I said okay acid you shared with me what you believed I said well we believe in a prophet his eyes got big I said we ever heard of a man named William Brown no I never heard of him I told him some history I said well we base this ministry off of Malachi 4 5 and 6. I said but he was here for running Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever I said it to him and he kind of you know he didn't really care to hear what I had to say except that the fact we believed in the prophet so he moved this next point he said well that's interesting he said well what do you all actually call it I said well we believe the message of William Branham was the message of Jesus Christ to the Bible he said well that's interesting he said we believe Malachi 4 too he said in our movement is also a message he said we believe there's a message he said and we believe that in that message of Malachi 4 there is a direct connection between Malachi 4 and to Revelation 10 and the Seven Thunders Revelation 10 are directly connected to Malachi 4. brother you talking about the hair stand up on your arms you're already an eerie feeling building anyhow how close and yet go that far off in deception man and man actually stood up he said the the David crashed up he said I'm the lamb to open the seals the one to loose the seals and the pastor actually challenged him and said no said you're not and said that's an antichrist teaching that's an antichrist spirit and said now what's going to happen is either you repent of it or you'll burn in the fires what the pastor told him so they actually turned the the explosion to Ezekiel 9 the prophecy of Ezekiel man you say why are you saying all that to say they based their things off the same scriptures [Music] they use the same symbols to vindicate what they believe and look what it ended up in but there's a bride using those same scriptures and look where she's headed she's headed to Rapture she has been translated by the kingdom of God why'd you say that preacher I said that to tell you this the pillar of fire is our God not a man man guided and look where it landed but the pillar of fires guy in this bride she's walking Worthy of the revelation of the word of God you love him today I pray something's been said to bless you I pray something's been said to encourage you brother Wade thank you for allowing us to come be with you all once again we love you all with all of our hearts with the love of the Lord may God richly bless you amen as her brother comes won't you lead us in something I believe he's here today foreign if anyone needs prayer we're here to pray for you today [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in moments like days foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] singing [Music] hey man you feel like John today brother Ram said in there in Revelations 5 said John saw his name in the book [Music] hey what a wonderful thing to see your name in the Lamb's Book of Life the elect the elected of God I don't have a one bride and that's just Jim Dale God don't have a one bride and she's elected and as we've always said we are well taught we we understand all of our brother what he's saying this book is you the book is you you're the book by you know the people of the world they say we can read you like a the Bible says there was a book of remembrance written well when Jesus reached and grabbed that book from the hand of the one sitting on the throne if it was a dirty book brother Andrew he wouldn't attached him he wanted to touch that book but when he went around come around that throne we were on his mind he was Bloody he had died for us and he died to get those people back remember what astounding quote where brother Brown says Jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance adoption series read it many times you get a lot of googly eyes out of it but he didn't come to bring you and Harry came to bring you back to get to your inheritance your inheritance was a book before the foundation world with your name written in it no way for you to fail so when he reached to get that book brother Andrew he didn't hesitate he said that's me that's mine and those back in those days you know how they protected the Scrolls they put them in skin so when he reached to get that book he reads and got your skin too he got your skin too because this is the son of man Ministry this is the flesh Ministry this is a Ministry that we are the walking living breathing bride of Jesus Christ and I truly believe let's give our brother another hand and we appreciate him appreciate his wife Coming um sister Ryan and little Malachi I told him I said well Malachi uh when his son gets four we're gonna have to have a Malachi for a birthday and then a five and six too so but it's good to have them with us and and um and just love their Ministry and he speaks to all of us young and old amen and and the word of the Lord is true and I believe he's been well taught himself so I I just really believe that we've heard from the Lord today we heard from the Lord yesterday and man we got to see that that's what it is it's a voice of God that speaks now someone hear a thunder so I'm gonna see lightning but Paul heard one voice and that voice was directed at him stall you can call them other guy's name that was around him they were sitting there were standing there going man what was that was that a message Paul said well he's talking to me okay hang on a minute because he said Saul why do you persecute me he said Lord so there was a connection and then we know what happened he became Paul but them other people it never records them other people that were with him ever even done anything they just they just went off into history never to be remembered why because they didn't hear the voice is that what we're doing today we just here because I've always said because we got something somebody else don't have you know we've got a special message well yeah we do have a special message but God is the one that gave us the part to be worthy and the part to be worthy humbles us more than makes us exalted white brother I'm saying a revelation he said it will not exalt you it will humble you it's so humble that God can as as all of us have come together today we've all got to pass life all of us do we're all humans but God deemed us Worthy he put that in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again put a no fishing sign up too right right so we're going to listen to what the devil said or we're going to listen to what God's already said because he's the worthy one is not so let's just push him out of the way I was thinking as brother was preaching you know when that seal broke the white horse rider rode away yeah because there was a revelation come forth Satan hates brother William say Satan hates Revelation right he hates it he can't stand it well you know what when the Revelation came that follow us on Holy Ghost was not the correct baptism the devil had to ride away from that all the great doctrines that we have today the devil can't stand it he's nowhere to be found he's rode away from it trinitarian Doctrine when it was busted out he went right now everything Satan was riding away from he was away ran away from the prophet he was on his horse yeah sure the world loved him but he's not a part of us that seal broke when that seal broke it separated and like I say I read that quote last Sunday I call you bright now I put a marker right here and and now you you're identified now when I say bride from this day forward I'm talking about you I ain't talking about the I'm not well I might be no you're bright not Methodist Baptist Pentecostal way I'm your bride and I'm talking to you that's why he had to separate the bride in the church because he was coming to the seals of fifth seal and all the different ones showing that the church went through the tribulation but the bride didn't so he had to separate that first so he had to get that out of your mind I told him the other day the greatest one of the greatest Revelations and it's not it may not be the seals or whatever the greatest Revelation that I have is I ain't got to go through tribulation because all your denominations say we have to go through the tribulation a part of it anyway well not in this church not here no we ain't going through it on tribulation praise God that's a good enough Revelation to shout about for a few days right there anyway that you're not that you're deemed Worthy to be there with the man that died for me in you and he's here now in all of us in the many membered body good to have each and every all of you here we sure appreciate you we love you uh now we're going to go downstairs our sisters are preparing we're going to have some uh there'll be some tacos and queso and dip different things down there but let me remind you there's a lot of people here don't get three or four of one
