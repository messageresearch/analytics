========================================

i want to see you open the eyes of my heart open the eyes in my heart shining holy holy i want to see amen and amen and amen is that your desire you know what god will make a way amen he always has amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord he'd like to turn in your scriptures during where we've been reading hebrews 11 we'll go from 11 verse 1 through verse 6 and then we'll go to nehemiah 8. remember the announcements now the uh we had to postpone the communion this past weekend because of the of the the doings you know and the fish fry and i want to say that we really thoroughly enjoyed what i did the fish fried and doing i thought they'd done a wonderful job cooking and the sisters serving and everybody bringing and doing i thought it was really marvelous myself i've been enjoyed it and i thank all of you for everything that you've done preparing it and getting everything ready and doing that and we'll have to do that more often but it turned out good but now we will have the communion then the lord willing this coming sunday all right because just for this month only because we was not able to do it on the first sunday all right now remember then the fellowship meeting will be at brother pageants on the third saturday uh 3 30 if you want to go with us make sure you let us know and a place to stay or whatever it would be let everybody know for sure and then we'll all be ready to go looking forward to fellowship and i always do i like to go in fellowship with my brothers and sisters in christ all right hebrews 11 any other announcements i generally miss i think that's all the announcements you've already prayed we believe that the lord will continue to be with brother ryan's little baby and get his baby there and take care of it we believe that what it'll be done and sister mary uh dardy you know they had to put her back in the hospital uh the other day and brother doherty said they was going to run tests to see about her stomach because they had pretty well ruled out everything else so they were going to try to go into that realm and see if they could find what was causing her to have problems so just pray for it amen let's turn in hebrews 11 and nehemiah 8. heavenly father we thank you lord for this day in the hour that we're living the time that we have we thank you for your grace and your love thank you for being you and we ask you to just bless and guide us tonight that you'd come among us and you'd open our understanding unto thy word as we sing open the eyes of my heart lord truly that's my desire not just my head that's wonderful but to open it all the way into my heart and just have you away with each one of us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives and lord remember the little baby there take care of it bring it all through all of it and we're sister darty remember all the other sick among us you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we thank you we love you father just have your way now and guide us in jesus name amen hebrews 11. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by dealers obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which were seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now just one scripture nehemiah if you'll look at it and study it you'll find out this is uh following watergate you remember now that it falls in verse 1 there that they stood before the watergate and read the scriptures and god how it come in the end time you know that this prophet's message come before the big watergate times but you know just getting down to verse eight look what it said so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading hallelujah you may be seated lord had his blessing now we'll get to that in a minute just to make a point of what we're talking about but i want you to think on something and i'll try to get it up front um a point but it says there that he would uh give the sins well we think of and that's the only time in the bible the word sense is used you know we think it's you somewhere talking about five senses or whatever no it's not and i firmly believe now in five senses all right we'll get to that in a few minutes but where did we get that word from and what does it mean you know well it just means a sense of you're in a sense of feeling a sense of that you know but we don't ever think about uh why things are like it is now what i want you to think about a minute and i don't have any form or layout to bring it from but i want to get a point across to you about something that i've been dealing with and looking at and just keep on going and straight toward it and watch it unfold until you know we can move on further all right but when we talk about the word faith what does the word faith mean to you what do you think about when you hear the word faith you know we can go through a lot of things talking and and saying the prophet said it's this he said faith is a revelation all right now uh where did he get that from where did he get that faith is a revelation well remember now we quote brother branham and we quote him so much until we begin to think the bible says that when it actually doesn't say that you know and we uh we say well the bible says faith is revelation well there's no scripture come on there's no scripture it says faith is a revelation all right see that is an understanding amen from what the word faith means right a revelation is to uncover something something that's hidden right it's make known right all right and and bringing out those things but why would the prophet say faith is a revelation i was laying there in the bed the other night thinking about it and i thought lord we take a lot of things for granted in our lives and we think we know what we're talking about in a lot of respects and uh you know but is it let me ask you the question is it a revelation because we can have a great uh ability to understand to explain uh and things but is it a revelation and what is a revelation a revelation is like uncovering something we'll give it a minute it's like something that's been hidden but then it's made known and we call it revealed but then why would the prophet say faith is a revelation did he get it from the uh definition of the word you know did he get that understanding where did he get it from and well he was a prophet we'll praise the lord it's got to be in the word though because he's the word prophet all right and we believe it's dire but i'm i'm trying to lay something down to make you think sister gail make you think all right something to go home and consider have you ever looked up the definition of the word faith you know have you ever looked it up to understand what it is you know it's only used two times in the old testament i showed you that you know in deuteronomy 32 and 20 if they can pull these up he's talking about i'll hide my face from them and see what their ends shall be for they are very forward generation children in whom is no faith see the word faith remember we went through explaining it it's not an old testament word it is a new testament word meaning that it has greater meaning over here than dire and they were not born again back there so it limited their point so you would use like you know i know i believe know it's been made known to me those words were used to express what they were and in doing that it didn't give the true meaning so then look at that was one a brothers this is one b i put these in later because of what came to me that word where it's talking about who children in whom is no faith is number 529 which is faithfulness trusting faithful or trustee all right in whom is no faith it doesn't have a good enough connection to hebrews 11 1. you remember i tried to go through this now here's the reason so the next time it's used in habakkuk 2 and 4. behold his soul is lifted up excuse me behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the choice shall live by his faith remember we get in the new testament it doesn't say that you shall live by his faith instead of just shall live by faith all right and here it has more of a reference to the individual because look at the 530 which is the number used for it and it says firmness fidelity which means that your your uh loyalty sometimes uh steadfastness or steadiness see it's more or less dealing with you in the things you remember how we went through that but before we go to the hebrews 11 1 i want it to dwell in your mind and i want you to think what is faith why would the bible say now some of you already got sleepy i said i was going to do this before you got sleepy and three of you is already nodding your head so all right come on why would paul say when the definition of coming forth here seems to deal with faithfulness trusting trusting it be firmness fidelity steadiness why would paul say faith is the substance of things so far when the word faith according to webster and according to the strongest concordance doesn't relate to that that's why i asked to wonder if you've ever looked it up to see what the natural wording is i believe it'll be something shocking in a second that'll really open your eyes to something that i've been dealing with for many years for you to see all right go ahead and pull up we don't have to go with hebrews 1 we know i mean 11 1 we know what that is faith is a substance we'll pull up the definition brother which is one e this comes from number 4102 all right now this is taken from the word faith in the new testament and the basis i looked up there may be a little differential in a certain wording but if you notice a little differential in the old testament between the two words faith that was used because a writer or a or the person who does these things like a concordance is not supposed to be translating by revelation but giving you verbatim word for word what it says and what that word means and the strongest concordance is more or less giving you the meaning of that word at that time we look at the word faith the word faith is faith assurance belief belief belief them that believe fidelity like i said means loyalty or uh appearance to fact and things means accuracy but look roll it on up a little now faith is conviction of the truth of anything belief in the new testament of a conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to god and divine things generally with the idea or included idea of trust and holy fervor born of faith and joined with it relating to god the word faith is the conviction that god exists and is the creator and ruler of all things the provider and restorer of eternal salvation through christ relating to christ the word faith is a strong and welcome conviction or belief that jesus is the messiah whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of god it's all if you notice what i'm talking about it's all relating back to a belief that's the point i want you to get believing belief the religious beliefs of christians belief with the predominant idea of trust or confidence whether in god or in christ springing from faith in the same fidelity faithfulness the character one who can be relied on now there's no indication there from the word faith of it connecting to hebrews 11 1. now hang on what i said get you where you walk webster says faith is confidence or trust in a person or thing it's belief in god or in the doctrine or teaching of religion belief in anything it's doctrines or tenets or are creeds or dogma you know because this is the baptist faith this is the catholic faith this is the so-and-so faith all right webster gives a good idea on it he said faith is a belief that it's not based on truth can you swallow that one well it is it's based on the mind but see what he's saying people don't believe the bible so a faith is based upon man's ideas and that's why you got this faith that faith this faith that faith and you've got all of that relating to faith but you still have no connection to answer me what is faith is it just a belief is it a doctrine is it a creed is it an assumption you remember we've been through a lot of this it's not an imagination it's not okay is it a revelation all right now we're getting to something that ties it together that it is a revelation but why would it be said it's a revelation i just read you a few and you always read on down we will by faith abel offered unto god and more excellent sacrifice but it doesn't say in genesis that it was revealed to abel read your bible we know it was but it's not written in the scripture here comes the prophet that telling you the bible definition of faith would relate to revelation all right now to get the point to you what i'm talking about and then we'll get off of that get on something else i want you to think if the word faith is not an old testament wording but it's a new testament form then we've got to go to that to find it and we can't find a scripture that says faith is a revelation i mean i invite you to go home and run what you want to see we're taking what brother branham says and we're using that to say what we're saying but do we have any anchor into the word to be able to comprehend thank you thank you so we asked god that's what i learned our thank you neither not us lord that's right the word faith is so important it's so great but we cannot take the natural understanding of what even the authors of strong's concordances etc even webster doesn't bring it to a point where we can comprehend what faith really is so he had a man to write what faith was god had a man to write what faith was the word faith is so great in the new testament until he would come on the scene to give his own definition would you go with me on that that if it's a word that we don't we can't use the background things to do definitions of it to come out to a total correct understanding and it must be revealed to us it must be a revelation for your prophet's right when he said faith is a revelation but now how would he place that back into scriptures for it to line up we've read it we've read it we've read it how many times have you ever read hebrews 11. you realize in hebrews 11 god is defining what the word faith is let that sink come slow try it i want it to be slow it's up to god to define that and make sure we would get the correct understanding of the word faith that's right and then it's so simple the god came to the apostle paul and he was writing about the just shall live by faith remember the message that's hebrews 10 38 he drops down a few verses to 11 1 and he finalizes his statement before he starts his uh point of bringing it of it being a revelation he gave you the exact definition of the word faith faith is the substance right is that clicking right god himself is defining he doesn't need a strong's concordance remember brother branham would say i looked and i looked and i looked he said i couldn't find that said finally i come up with a word he couldn't find a definition or an answer for what he was looking for in the wording and even in the definitions of the wording then the holy spirit would drop down and pick out something and say there it is the word form means in morphy and he'd say there it is but he had a revelation so if i ask you again and i say what is faith what is the biblical bible answer for the word faith you don't have to quote brother branham as it's a revelation although that's wonderful that's right but then you try to quote what the definition of the word is and your mind is going to lead you away from the truth what is faith paul said it is the substance you say it was a revelation he had the revelation of what it was right he had the revelation of what faith was he said faith is the substance the things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen by it we know the worlds were framed by the word of god did that strike home to you okay i'll wait on you i don't mind holding it and keep on preaching i'll wait on it for it to drop into your heart what don't you say it but you'll see that's what i've been saying the whole time what is faith faith of revelation we got the quotes from the prophet it's the revelation amen what's the revelation a revelation is the uncovering or making known of god to man well the prophet's right when he says faith is revelation but we know by revelation that abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain we know by revelation that enoch walked off the earth or better known to us is it that it says through faith we understand you see why it's a new testament word do you get it faith then is a new testament word because the importance of the word would come into being here faith is the substance that's the definition of the word faith god gave it himself he doesn't have to depend upon him yet he uses man to write books and and to do things in concordances and in dictionaries and things to help us and we thank god for it but just remember to read is not a revelation remember we brought that out a few weeks ago and the prophet said it that way to read is not a revelation it's when something's revealed to you and something's made known to you and to you only but brother dale i got a revelation brother someone got a revelation that's all right i'm not talking about that but i'm talking about one thing a revelation is personal to you it's not a collective it's personal to you and you only you and you only have it but the other person says i'm the only one's got this is that any problem there any problem for the apostle paul to stand before the brother and then say brother and i'd like for you to realize that none of you have added one thing to what god showed me remember that in the book of acts i'm paraphrasing it just to her but it's close enough the boy you think here comes a god and all he's ever done is kill people and and done all kind of dirty things wrong and he goes out in the wilderness won't even stay with the rest of them and let them teach him right and he goes all by himself and he comes stomping back out he ain't listening to the hierarchy right he didn't get it he said from man that would have been definitions and things and wordings and etc and he didn't care who it was that he was talking to he said you didn't add one thing and what the lord revealed to me now did he mean that peter and them didn't have no revelation or did he mean that they didn't have even maybe greater revelation than him no he just said i didn't get it from you i got it from god well you know peter was supposed to say it that way right peter's supposed to say i didn't get it from nobody else i got it from god alone because that's where it come from i thought we believed in personal revelation i thought we believed in a god that was revealing himself to us but my point is we try to get things upon wording and i'm the world's worst to do it so i'm not throwing off on it right i give the definitions of words i give the strong concordance i give the webster definition we do that because what else can we do are you going to come up with some kind of a hocus pocus jiminy okay's word that don't exist in the human language no we do the best we can do but the best we can do a lot of time don't bring a revelation the bible always said there was just one god right where did we get the concept of a trinity and called it a revelation you remember the other week i titled one message i didn't tell you the title but the title to one of the message was is how sure of the accuracy of god's word how sure it is why because faith revelation is a substance if you've got a revelation of one god come on you've got the substance of god now you want swallow for that one that shaky spirit's getting there again swallow it down if you've got a revelation you've got the substance that god exists from you agree with me so then what is the bible definition considering all of the wordings in the things of the word faith very simple and what's more simple everybody says brother dale is so deep i'm sure a lot of you were thinking well i was saying that man he's confused me so much i don't know what's going on he's so deep how much more simple can you get than to say god told paul the definition of faith he didn't look it up in webster's dictionary he never had a strong concordance to get it from god told him what faith was faith is the substance of things hoped for just run that through your mind and just keep thinking on it and keep saying that well he did read to me worthy it looked like the word faith has got other relationships and to the point in a very little relationship to the real understanding of hebrews 11 1. i think at least you'd admit that when you you see in that respect then do we have a substance revelation or do we have our own concept and call it a revelation hey if you're afraid of what you believe and won't tell what you believe all of what you believe because you're afraid somebody will differ with you or whatever then you don't have it i've been in the same preacher i've got a great revelation right here i'm going to read to you after a while and they never read it i want to get them go read the notes i'm honest see do they have anything or do they try to make you think they got something man got the goods ain't worried about them being put to the test right older brother the other day i said we've got all the tapes here from 83 82 somewhere in there up and they're on the internet and i'm sure that richard's got most of them on there by now they have all of them but i know it's from 83 or 83 he said that's a lot of information right i said yep sure you know that way you can check me to see whether i've changed my doctrine or not you know but that way i can tell you i haven't because i can prove to you by the type that's why i'm not afraid of what i believe i want the world to know what i believe come on amen why because if it's a revelation what have i got to worry about that's right it's a man-made doctor and i've got a lot to worry about that's right but what about it a bible definition of the word faith is a very simple statement telling you what it is it's not an idea or a thought or a concept or a doctrine a recreate or a tenet or whatever that word is for you know it's the substance that's right right amen faith is the substance he said well what is faith it is the substance that's right right whatever i'm asking for the world was brought by faith enoch walked off the earth by faith what about it we'll get down to a little bit more sunday and you'll see more what i'm talking about but i hope you follow my point we quote brother branham and we say able by faith by revelation no other way but there was no bible back there written right that's what he says see it was revealed to abel right abel had a substance his substance was the thought that came from god into his heart thank you jesus and even in a lost condition as we'd call it he would still work and bring him to a place that he had a substance right you remember a man named peter that one day a man told him he said in fact be thee bid me come if if that's you lord put under your feet what's under my feet and i'll just walk out there he said just come on you have a substance but because he was not a born-again believer he began to sink because he began to doubt all right and as he did then he lost his substance right but he still had his confession right you know what his confession brought a hand out to him and put a substance back under him and he walked on the end of the boat right so what is a bible definition now the great man the apostle paul was defining that a joy shall live by faith and he said now listen before i get into these that have done these things by faith let me define the word faith it is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen my point just don't think because we have the definitions of something that that is what is being revealed it can be confusing great thing to have and a wonderful being but because confusing now let me go into the next part where do we get the idea that we have five senses what does the word sense mean s-e-n-s-e sins okay webster says the word sense is a realization inspiration a sense of awareness or recognition of something there's your best one it's a feeling or a perception you can actually webster says the word sense can actually go to discernment the only time the word sense is used in the bible is there in nehemiah 8 and 8 right where it says as they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading we say what do you mean we got five senses see taste field smell in here webster doesn't even agree with that because he gave you the definition of sense it's a realization or impression it's for inspiration i believe we're going to get to this and i don't want tonight so we may have trouble sunday sunday evening may be a long service i'll warn you i'm honestly serious but i want to play three quarters of a tape all right when we say sins i feel him i see him he went i hear him he laughed now give me webster on it he'll say okay we'll look up five senses in webster and you'll get see tasteful smelling gear save you trouble okay my point is just like the point was that i previously covered that we try to use words to express ourselves when sometimes words will not express the correct meaning are you with me yeah maybe you'll catch on one of these days what i've been doing for quite a while the strong's concordance says sense is go ahead and pull that up brothers it's number one that's where i supposed to start right here number one i was supposed to start it right here number 72 20 79 22 the word sense is prudence insight understanding prudence good sense insight understanding cunning or cutting craft by bad sense but where is it see tasteful smelling here there you know you know this is a very funny service tonight so you know i want you to think you think you got it all figured out just because we can read and we said the prophet said it but what is your revelation that's right can you explain to me what you're talking about without quoting brother branham or the letters of the bible but remember now the way we believe it that what we explain had better connect to what the prophet said and better connect to what the bible says and not be something different right but when you do you're going to be saying i say you're going to get in trouble i think this is what it means what about it listen to what your prophet had to say about census whoever number two i'd like to speak i would like to speak just a short time upon the subject of senses we're taught that the natural man has five senses and those five senses control his his or give god give him these five senses to contact his earthly home those senses are known as see taste feel smell here those five senses which are known to the natural man and they're good and we cannot operate or live in normal life when one of these senses failed to act do we agree with that now when we get down to what we're going to read on the next one let's see if you agree you agree that we cannot operate normally without see tastes feel smelly here because that's what we contact each other with that's what we associate with that's where we work that's what we live it's what we do all is related to that and it's called a sense now my point is is a sense of imagination or is it real is it just an imagination or is it real i'm looking at you that's a sense of sight you're looking at me that's a sense of sight that's not an imagination right that's right i wouldn't want to bite brother callie to see how he tasted but right the five senses are real right write that down write it down because that'll be the thought for the next two services the five senses are real they are a scientific fact remember now i don't have to have faith for a shirt to be on me or a tie it's dire that is a scientific fact right see takes phil smelling here is relating to scientific facts ain't talking about getting any huda duties in your mind and get your mind all messed up and start seeing things that ain't real we're talking about the five senses that are real you're the ones messing with that with drugs and all kind of things that's messing you up well you don't believe in spooks nope i believe we got we disputes but think about it see tastes feel smell in here is the senses of the body and we accept that as being what we're talking about all right but even though we would read the word sense would relate to realization impersonations a sense of awareness or recognition of something a feeling of perception that can come on down to see taste field smell and ear all right but brother brown says they're good and we cannot operate or live a normal life when one of these senses fails to act see there's something missing some portion of life that we cannot contact without the sense acting and they're good and they're useful and they were given to us by god they are real they're not an imagination or a thought they're real now look at the next one experiences 1948 e-73 if your sense of faith sense of faith and remember what faith is faith is a substance thing so far of faith here it is get it if your sense of faith declares to you that this gift come from god and you're going to be healed just as much as your desire declares that that's a white shirt you're sure to get it when you pass by he's talking about substance faith right sense of faith well brother devil is only five senses ct's phil but now there's six sins we'll get to that later we want to hold it on the point tonight sense of faith somebody answer your phone real quick ring once now now if you can trust the human part now what's the human part see taste field smelt here yeah right if you can trust the human part why not trust the superhuman part if you can trust a body will not trust the spirit for the spirit is superior over the body amen there it is see what i mean it's faith the substance of things hope for not a sense of faith faith is a sense all right i'm holding it to try to keep your mind from relating to the sixth sense as so much for the next message but that's what it is but i'm trying to get you to just look at it look at the next one the queen of the south 58 613. look what is faith i got a minute here face is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen now seeing isn't believing right it isn't many times come here paul there's a man standing by me got on a grey coat dark hair emmy believes that he said so now we know what he goes through i can feel him i can do this we got a new microphone system tonight we're playing with the ears like the rest of you do but we'll get it adjusted all right but he said what is faith a substance a thing hopefully every tense of things you do not see tastes feel smelly you believe it and if every person in here believes that jesus christ is present and is going to heal you just the same as your sight if you can see see that shirt's white that's it's settled if the synth of faith says it's right just the same as the sense of sight says it's right it's over amen you don't need praying for or nothing come on it's all over so then it's more real than see takes field smell in here a sense of faith is more real than anything you can see taste feel smell hear for real right he said it's the same as right let's go to the next one number five perfect strength by perfect weakness 61 11 29 paragraph 127. we're controlled by five senses and those five senses see taste filled smell in here is very fine until they interrupt the sense of faith then when they come against faith and how do you know which one is right how do you know where it's still sense of faith or the devil you know all right what he says because faith will always agree with the word amen and then if your faith is contrary to the word or you think it is then you haven't got faith you got to make believe that's right you've got a boost in your senses of some scholarship that you've learned about or something i love that one if it's contrary you gotta make believe you got a boost in your senses something happened to your senses of some scholarship that you've learned about or something but when you get away from that and depend completely upon faith and faith can only be built upon the word of god correct faith look at the next one that was paragraph 127 this is paragraph 128. he's coming down he's talking about the doctor and the things once but any man that's mentally balanced would know that that is the word of the living god now you're just talking about you know god's word you get all about it and looking at looking at the word all right he said with anybody with mental violence would know that that's the word of god but i can base my face upon that and show it's thus saith the lord and if anything is contrary to that then i don't believe my senses no sir just leave it alone go by your other sense the sense of faith the christians live by the sense of faith all right look at the next one diseases and afflictions 1956. now another sense that his hearing strikes some music during the play you know wrote it on it because you're going through the sense of hearing the sense of doing it now faith is the substance of things so far the evidence of things you do not see tastes feel smelly here but the sense of faith is just as real as your side is or any other of your senses how do we believe that do we actually believe that it's a sense of faith it's just as real really it's more real but that's just his point of brain something you can literally see feel here but is that your faith and you'll see why i said paul gave the definition of what faith was because god gave him a direct understanding faith is the substance of things so far think about it you see what i mean you believe it you just there's no one can make you doubt it because you're possessed with that sense that tells you it's soul that's why if the lord tells you you don't have to worry about it everything's all right all right now faith is the substance 1951 is something just as real as any other sense of the body it's just as real faith is the substance it just isn't a makeup or a thought it's a substance that's where the trouble's at you got a great revelation of this message and then somebody come along and talk you out of it and you follow these two souls two lords seventh under virtues perusias river jordans and you get all confused then you don't have a revelation because there's never been a revelation confused now i do have one in here that brother random says we let's pull us away from the faith but what is it it isn't a makeup or a thought it's a real substance it's something you just as real as any other sense of the body what there's these five senses that control this body now watch it and there's two senses control the inner man now listen to him and that's faith and unbelief for the inward man see tastes filled smelling here for the outward man all right sounds like there's two there but what is it going to the next one perseverance 1962 paragraph e faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things you do not see taste feel smelly here it's an actual sense that you know there's no getting away from it you're positive then something is going to happen when you have that i walked out of the baptist church they didn't run me out my family was a controlling or one of the controlling factors in the church which would have amounted out of a 200 group people about probably 150 of us they had rule set that no member could raise up and become pastor but i had enough votes to put me in where i wanted me it didn't run me off i left you know why i left you've heard me explain it right the baptist church any other church you can go from this church over you can go from a baptist to a methodist etc you don't have to have that rebaptizing thing but if you go from a methodist or anything pentecostal catholic or anything to a baptist church you're going to get baptized again that is their doctrine all right he said well why don't you keep bringing it up because at one point the day i got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i knew that day i was out the door it wasn't they run me out the door i was out the door that's right because i was contrary to them right and was no longer taking what they said i had a revelation have you ever had a revelation when somebody come up with a doctrine or an idea and you listen to them and they really are flamboyant and great with their words and you know seemingly convincing but all at once something says but that ain't right that's right something just says but that ain't right and have you ever been to the place if you were sincere enough to admit that you didn't know at that time what was right you couldn't explain why they was wrong you just knew there was something wrong so if it held on you had a substance right look what he goes on to did we get through perseverance yeah we read it that you know it there's no getting away from it you're positive there's something going to happen when you have that believe us thou this 1951 look what he says e65 right you got five senses wrote it on there in the human body haven't you see takes field smelling here i know he's standing there because of seed okay he's going through i'm from missouri you got to prove to me so i gotta prove to you the man standing there i see him i hear him i feel him right i don't know and i know he's there in my sense of of sight cannot see him but the sense of faith which is a separate sense declares that he is there you think he's jumbled but keep reading he unjumbles it he says my side you know but said he's a separate sense declares that he's there you say well that's just another sense because it's it's see or taste or feel or smell or hear no there's another sense it takes over a sense of faith let's get to life's room i'm doing pretty good i didn't think i'd get it this is part of the message that i'll ask you to listen to if you desire by sunday and you can see the title of it a super sense brother ray said he's done listen to it so some of you listen to it if you want to and we will connect into about paragraph 44 and run for quite a while in that message because it explains everything to a detail of what i've been talking about and i thought well i'll just let him say it instead of me quoting quoting quoting quoting quoting quoting you know we'll let him say it all right look what he says now cast down the reason of these senses believe the supersense the sense of faith that jesus gives we'll get into it sunday you can't have this super sense without the new birth now you got close to it in peternam but remember it was faith for the time so we're going to have to define that again where you'll understand it but we'll get down cast down the reason of these senses believe the supersense the sense of faith that jesus christ gives by that same sense listen read that next part right the sense of faith that jesus christ gives by that same sense god spoke when there was nothing right what is that sense that super sense is god the faith of god in you the part of god comes into you gives you the super sense but that same super sense god framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and a world suck into existence he said glory so you can see where we're going sunday we've got one more message before we play the tape but you can be looking up things all you'd like to because i enjoy you doing it go home in your computer and run in faith is a sixth sense you know it's been a whole lot of time and i'll show you that you you you'll lose a lot by saying faith is a sixth sense so just run in six cents and make sure you've got a lot of time just run in sixth sense these people only tell you couldn't understand my wording six the number six s-i-x-t eight since s-e-n-s-e just run it in like that and read for quite a while i like for you to read it doesn't do away with my job i think my job proved his point to start with about you trying to take your definitions of words and find out what faith is and i've done all of that too but then a little voice spoke and said the bible gives you the definition of faith the bible gives you the definition of faith faith is this substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen super sense sense of faith beyond your senses more real anchor that in your mind and think about it faith is more real than anything you can see taste feel smell here more real have you ever failed his presence when you turn around and look for it it doesn't joggle your mind because you don't see with your eyes yet the present still stays there without you seeing it tasting it feeling it smelling it but then sometimes he moves it into a rim but you'll see a flash of light you'll hear a rumbling of thunder you'll smell it and you'll know his presence is real i wish i could anchor that into your heart right that god is real he's not just an imagination this old god is a spirit he don't have no form well he made man his own image i guess we don't have no form you see where we're at we've become educated people who think that we by education have a revelation if our education won't fit our revelation we got a problem that's right right we get in trouble but you just sit down a minute and think lord you mean you created me and i think that you're just a glob that you're just a spirit floating around remember what the prophet said let's get god's atom bomb faith what do you call it and within my hand i hold enough to blow up the world remember the world came from some existence was spoken into being i'll end by making this statement and listen to it to be healed you must believe in your heart and confess with your mouth you wait you pray for god to reveal that to you when you do your life at the doctor because you've got a substance he can't see to be saved you must believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that you are saved he makes intercession upon our profession our confession we say we're lost he says we're lost we say we're saved he says we're saved somebody made a statement the other day and probably didn't realize it how long i've been preaching it i don't mean maybe wouldn't somebody here but somebody here did make that statement too but but you know the rapture comes that somebody's gonna speak it right i've taught that ever since the beginning 40 something years i've tried to get you to see that that if there's going to be a rapture somebody's going to have to speak and to illustrate it i say brother random says on the rapture message it has been spoken now let it come to pass you realize they would have never been a rapture had he not said that we're going to have to say we're changed before we're changed but it doesn't do any good to write letters or send it to everybody in the world so we're already changed then go out and live like the devil the rest of the week someday somebody's going to say it nobody's going to have to say it say where it's already changed but it'll be a revelation not a concept or a thought and it won't be because somebody else said it seen the videos of the man speaking he said brother branham would have to speak our glorified body into existence what he said but i believe you and i will have to we'll have to speak our glorified body into existence i don't believe brother branham could speak all of our bodies into existence i believe he can speak his own come on man but i believe you and i are going to have to speak and that's what god's waiting on a man asked me the other day he said what do you think is the end of the world the end of all things and i just kind of let him lead the way and he began to talk about the great things happening here and the great thing happening here my wife said later said why didn't you tell him that brother brown said they wouldn't but one thing holding off the coming of the lord and that was the readiness of the bride right i said honey i didn't think of it and you know why the prophet says when you don't think of it it wasn't meant for you to say it there was no such thing for me to call him on the phone and tell him i let him talk about what he taught would bring the end of the world you know all natural things that's good what about the church is the revelation you have a substance that's right or it is is it an imagination boost it up as we read boost it up in your senses by some scholarship come on some teaching some idea you see the people of this message and i'm watching them for 40 something years somebody come along got to move oh boy they're up they're up oh wow we're going to speak that word boy and glory glory that brother's got everything and had a while they just start and then most of them go back to the world a few of them stay with the message but let nothing happen in there up again and going again you know what do you have come on that's why i put it on the internet i'm not afraid of anything i preach it's open to the public open to the world boy brother dale i'm not going i'm not going to let the world know what i believe they'll prove to you you don't believe what you believe you know hey man i'm not an idiot i'm not going to explain that einstein was wrong are you you know what i mean by that i'm not going to tackle the world about a light bulb because i don't know nothing about it but i do know what this word says come ahead musicians thank god that's what we should know amen the bible says they that know their god what shall do exploits but they that know their god are you afraid of your revelation if you believe something contrary to me and you're so afraid of what you believe that you wouldn't come and talk to me about it you don't have a revelation because you're afraid i'm not afraid of anybody i'm not afraid to suggest doctrine with anybody because i'll just tell you what i believe at least you can find you can show me what i'm right or wrong brother dale i'd come and talk to you but you just ain't level-headed enough to understand that may be true but i'll try to get it over to the side some way you know i'll do the best i can you know what i want to be right i mean we've come a lot of us 40 50 years and we've been serving god and then we would just happily want to end this thing up no understand no faith is the substance that's what it is of what anything consists of anchored back to god no there's only one faith one lord one baptism one god father what does it say only one i hope you understand what i'm saying what we got right 369. you have a need i believe that same god is here i don't have to see him feeling tasting smelling or hearing i believe him he said i'll be with you always he didn't say always that he'd be right with us so much we could feel it a lot of times brother danny he just backs up i don't see what you'll do i want to see what you're doing i don't see what you're doing what are you doing where are you standing understanding faith is a revelation that's what we ask for right father we lay our hands upon our brother asking you to open his understanding as he said he talked with a man the other day and was amazed lord sometimes we are understanding it over a lot more than we think but we just ask you to open this understanding as to the correct things or writing or doings and all in life and being just open is understanding of you lord you come on the scene and you be unto him the thing that he has made of in jesus name anybody else what about it will your face stand the test it ain't gonna be long until you're gonna find out whether it'll stay in the test or not what's it gonna be well my revelation is what i'm walking on not afraid of it glad to tell you what i believe never been able to keep a secret i just refuse a lot of times to talk to people because i know if i start talking to you we have bible study saturday night and and some of them have learned a few tricks of the trade and they they try to pull me into a sparta talking about what i'm gonna preach on and i i know that but i'm still human i'll i'll still lean over that way and that while i say i'm not going any further i'm not gonna talk anymore on it because i want it to come and let you hear because see i really believe faith the definition of faith is that it's the substance of what i have need of i believe well then if i have a revelation of just one god that's the substance of that god mr gill it's not something we're going to get it's what we have at least let's walk on what we got if he's just seeing water baptism thank you lord gotta be something real faith the substance not an imagination or a thought it won't hold you somebody talk you out of it but if you really got it it'll hold you you have your hand upstairs i was just thinking about myself and i think it's like we have a veil over our eyes like before you know who god really is that veil you know and we look at ourselves with these earthly eyes and we look at each other with these earthly eyes how in the world can we make a rapture looking at people and ourselves like that we've got to go beyond that and look at ourselves the way god looks at us and the way he looks at other people and if we can do that with godly eyes we're going to be a whole lot closer but it's something he gives you you can't work yourself into it it's a revelation and i seek that revelation because when i look at myself i think how could this body this person this how could i make a rapture you know and i was talking to some sisters tonight and i think they basically may feel the same way that i do uh you look at other people and you think oh they're just so much better than i am anyway i that's just was thought that kept going through my mind you've got to change the way you look at yourself and in other things to get beyond this veil that's over your eyes to move in to a place where we can have a rapture remember god doesn't deal with see takes field spelling god deals with the supersense of faith he doesn't live in our natural capacities he lives in a realm of supernatural because he's already been here in a natural so what it was like understands us but he's in a supernatural realm not looking at things we do or don't do he doesn't do that but then what's the problem is it's like i tried to explain it the other day then for me to know that he doesn't look at me and see what i do you mean i would in any way have a thought in my mind that it doesn't matter because he doesn't see me i'm under the blood he doesn't sin how could i ever have that thought that it's all right for me to do anything because he doesn't see me that's all right i know i'm guilty but he didn't see me no i want to repent i want to confess and believe well because of what he's done for me then i look beyond the natural i've asked you before have you ever done it i looked at a person one day with my own natural eyesight and was standing there looking just like looking at brother collie with my natural eyes and all at once i went back in my head and i saw that person different than i'd ever seen them in my life i didn't see their faults and failures i saw them the way god saw he said what i've never done that would brother that one all right maybe sometimes you don't want to do the things that some people have seen and done because it's too much requirement goes with it and that way then there's no need of talking about it because people get the wrong idea you pray that god let you see people different than what they are well i'll tell you what i'm going to let them get by with that i'm going to preach be careful be careful truth is truth we must tell it and a lot of times i have to tell it but i don't like it you don't like the truth no i don't like to have to tell it because it always hurts i told a man at work one day something and i said because i've told you i will lose your friendship i did i said because i told you i've told people i'm not going to talk to you anymore because if i talk to you anymore i'm going to say something that's going to cause you not to be my friend anymore and i don't want to lose you you ever been that away amen never been where you could just look at somebody and say lord is any way i could take their place is there any way that i could just stand in their place and help them remember we're not living for ourselves we're living for others lord jesus we thank you we just ask you to help us lord as we go home just be with everybody give a safe journey and take care of everybody and you said that you sent your word and healed us we believe it we believe that we've done the best we can do tonight of talking about your word as the truth of your word and what faith really is we believe that it will heal and deliver we love you and we thank you forgive our sins and goddess keep us in your love lord have your way in jesus name you dismiss remember the services sunday you
