[0:00] this ain't no this just think it's safe
[0:03] ignore resistant all right everybody
[0:13] hope everybody's doing well on this
[0:15] Easter Damon morning yes where we every
[0:19] Sunday you know we celebrate the
[0:20] resurrection of the Lord amen that's
[0:22] right but today symmetrically importance
[0:26] our nificantly special because if he
[0:29] didn't rise we don't rise naturally
[0:31] he was the first fruit thereof also look
[0:35] at right here just a moment about that
[0:37] but uh anyway so I hope everybody's had
[0:41] it been week keep those in Perth we're
[0:44] still traveling but those that are out
[0:46] will probably have a lot of people out
[0:48] today so all right so we've been talking
[0:51] about this kingdom of God and we want to
[0:53] try and bring it to my analogy today and
[0:57] so last time we left with that the
[1:01] kingdom of God has to be established in
[1:03] you before it can manifest outside
[1:06] because God said quote down here were
[1:10] leading moment but God said I'm in his
[1:14] way of thinking and it just makes sense
[1:16] that's what you know what brother
[1:17] Branham said is that power without
[1:20] character it's a tendon but you can
[1:23] reign but but there's there for example
[1:27] in the physical there's been dictators
[1:29] that have reigned they've had power but
[1:31] it's caused a lot of chaos no satanic
[1:36] Hitler for one you know he had power you
[1:41] know but he had power but it was the you
[1:50] know it was ten
[1:51] so in the in the Christian in the life
[1:54] of a believer it's the same way God is
[1:57] not going to put you to reign it or
[1:59] something if you don't if you can't
[2:01] control yourself you see you don't have
[2:05] power over yourself how are you gonna
[2:07] reign over his kingdom you see so that's
[2:12] I think brother Wang has mentioned this
[2:14] before to have power over this earth
[2:16] first try this earth to have power over
[2:19] it that's what God wants if you can have
[2:21] power but you can't have power over it
[2:23] unless the power is already in use right
[2:27] which is the Holy Ghost the Word of God
[2:30] the kingdom of God all those things are
[2:33] the kingdom right amen so we talked
[2:36] about in Genesis 1:26 where it says and
[2:39] God said let us make man in our image
[2:41] after our likeness right
[2:44] that man was just like God and let them
[2:47] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[2:49] and over the fowl of the air and over
[2:51] the cattle and over all the earth and
[2:53] over every creeping thing that he
[2:55] includes cockroaches that includes worms
[2:59] that includes everything you have
[3:00] dominion over all those things and I
[3:02] know we have dominion over those roaches
[3:04] even today yeah because I'm not gonna
[3:07] crush them you know I can spiders - we
[3:10] have dominion over all those things but
[3:12] that's not that Dominion they was
[3:14] talking about there was no death there
[3:18] right but we don't have Neath the menu
[3:21] no power over or fish of the sea over
[3:24] the birds of the earth that no strict
[3:27] away from us when Adam was and he fell
[3:30] into sin right but that's the power that
[3:32] God wants to bring us back to you see
[3:34] right and then that Genesis 1:26 man
[3:38] Adam had that power can you imagine that
[3:41] you know to have dominion over all the
[3:44] ultra over all the earth sure but we
[3:47] don't know anything that's kind of hard
[3:49] for us to fathom it's kind of hard it's
[3:50] kind of like for us to think that God is
[3:52] always eternal cuz you can your mind can
[3:55] go all the way back you think about that
[3:57] and it's like there's a limitation to
[3:58] your mind but incorrect that's like oh
[4:00] my goodness it's like you go on and you
[4:02] know then that's the same thing but
[4:04] that's what God has written but brother
[4:07] Graham said that when you receive the
[4:09] Holy Ghost when you're born again it's
[4:12] like you're going back to that truck
[4:14] yeah that's right
[4:15] - that Adam Genesis 1:26
[4:17] amen now all we have to do is we're
[4:20] waiting for that Genesis 1:26 men to
[4:23] manifest on the outsiders right right
[4:25] all right and so brother Brown said that
[4:29] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[4:31] reign with him because we have to go
[4:33] through some suffering here on earth you
[4:35] have to suffer to reign the reason for
[4:38] this is that character simply is never
[4:41] made without suffering character is a
[4:44] victory that's right that's why that's
[4:47] why God says to them to them that
[4:50] overcome will I give such-and-such right
[4:53] all through in the book of Revelation to
[4:55] them that this but because there's a
[4:58] part of iU to do ma there is a part for
[5:01] the ceilin of Israel that they have to
[5:02] go possess the land that God wasn't just
[5:04] gonna take me better and I'll put him
[5:07] over there now they had to do it to the
[5:09] part but the promise was already there
[5:11] right he's the reason for this that
[5:15] character simply has never made without
[5:17] suffering characters of victory not a
[5:19] gift the man without character cane
[5:21] train because power of art from
[5:23] character is satanic but power with
[5:29] character is fit to rule power with
[5:32] characters patron and since he wants us
[5:34] to share it even his throne on the same
[5:36] basis that he overcame and this set down
[5:40] in his Father's throne then we have to
[5:42] overcome to sit with him you know when
[5:44] he raised from the dead and he was
[5:46] ascending he said all power is given
[5:49] unto me both heaven and earth that's the
[5:53] same heart that God wants for you and me
[5:55] to have potentially we already have that
[5:57] in our soul right just waiting for that
[6:01] to be manifested on the outside now so
[6:04] that's why these virtues need to be
[6:06] established in the believers life and
[6:08] after that Kingdom has come into
[6:11] believer in the belief that's right
[6:12] right okay it can't be the other way
[6:16] around some people say you have to climb
[6:18] the stature perform at first then get
[6:19] the Holy Ghost that's wrong because
[6:22] these are all these are all Holy Ghost
[6:25] virtues you have to have the Holy Ghost
[6:27] first and then
[6:29] in order for you to manifest these these
[6:32] these virtues you can manifest them on
[6:34] your own
[6:34] amen you try it there's there's a
[6:38] portion of it that you could do remember
[6:40] the Pharisees had a portion of they had
[6:43] knowledge they had some temperance rally
[6:44] ahead but it wasn't it wasn't Holy Ghost
[6:47] that's right virtue it wasn't Holy Ghost
[6:49] knowledge it wasn't Holy Ghost
[6:51] you see that's right so and I like this
[6:55] picture always like this this particular
[6:57] picture because the head is at the
[7:00] handsome building the body to my right
[7:03] and that's the statue performance right
[7:07] that's the kingdom that's being built
[7:10] it's his his body valuable image now a
[7:15] couple of months ago or several or maybe
[7:18] two years ago I preached the message and
[7:21] up me you bring this up here I have it
[7:24] right here but and then and of course
[7:29] this is just me you know this is just
[7:31] the way whenever I look at this chart
[7:32] III can't help us see in this because
[7:36] this but to me you know this the way
[7:38] this was draw it out to me it looks like
[7:41] it's a body that's laying flat kind of
[7:44] like this you know laying in a casket
[7:46] and and at the end time it's gonna
[7:50] resurrect that's right right when you
[7:53] went when you wake up in the morning
[7:54] what comes up first is the head that's
[7:57] why Jesus Christ had to resurrect first
[7:59] he came up first he was my first fruits
[8:02] of the of the resurrection and then
[8:06] because remember jesus said that the
[8:09] first shall be last and the last shall
[8:11] be first right that's the reason why
[8:13] this is coming up first then everything
[8:16] and everybody else from from F will race
[8:19] race you see I mean you when you get up
[8:22] from your bed your feet don't get up
[8:25] first
[8:25] usually it's it's your head
[8:28] it comes up and then kind of for those
[8:31] that kind of get up a little slowly you
[8:33] know now some of the young people I mean
[8:36] they make they make they make just kind
[8:38] of but so that's just me I'm not making
[8:46] a doctrine out of it or anything like
[8:48] that that's just it's interesting that
[8:50] that was kind of drawn like that you
[8:51] know and it looks like a body that's
[8:52] laying down but in the end time it's
[8:54] gonna all right right into that into
[8:56] that into that full man right there amen
[9:03] praise the Lord that's the kingdom of
[9:06] God that God's interested in it and it's
[9:07] a visit and if the believer has that
[9:09] Holy Ghost in his life that God's own
[9:11] soul in him that's what he's interested
[9:14] in that's why that's why we're that's
[9:17] why I said last week whoever said you
[9:19] don't need these virtues is line because
[9:22] the believer the believer inside desires
[9:25] these women when they born again
[9:27] desirous to have these virtues yesterday
[9:30] and then somebody said well it's not
[9:32] important you know well for one then why
[9:36] did Peter talk about it and - why did
[9:38] brother Brennan preach the whole long
[9:40] service about that man you see but you
[9:43] say he was the messenger at the end time
[9:45] he was the property and time and you
[9:47] just kind of don't look at the annual 70
[9:49] weeks don't look at but you we don't
[9:50] need that we don't need that we need
[9:52] these things salmon they're not there
[9:55] just to be there right all right so if
[9:59] you remember when Daniel had the the
[10:01] dream about the the statute moon and in
[10:05] that in the in Daniel 2 you can read all
[10:07] about it
[10:07] but in that dream he had a statute and
[10:11] it was it was it was built from the head
[10:13] down to the feet right the gold the
[10:17] silver it represents empires you know
[10:19] and then at the end time the iron and
[10:22] the clay would mix modern powers
[10:24] brethren called the Romanism and
[10:26] understand it at the end time and so but
[10:32] that's how Satan builds his kingdom this
[10:37] kingdom has no foundation
[10:38] that's what was built from the head
[10:40] right down to the feet work but God's
[10:43] kingdom is built from the feet up in the
[10:46] head that's right that's why it stands
[10:49] this kingdom built and that's the reason
[10:51] why Jesus the rock come down if you read
[10:54] that in Daniel 2 comes down hits the
[10:56] feet and it all just crumbles right
[10:59] there is no sure foundation of that
[11:00] that's the reason I'm in Denton just
[11:02] looking at Daniel - you already sees
[11:04] things defeated his kingdom in earth is
[11:07] defeated that's right so I thought that
[11:10] was interesting he hits him in defeat
[11:12] huh he hits him in defeat he hits him in
[11:15] defeat he hits him in divinity in the
[11:26] defeat he's defeated anyway all right so
[11:34] Satan bills is Kingdom with no sure
[11:36] foundation from the head down to the
[11:38] feet that's why it falls apart Christ
[11:40] builds Kingdom from the feet to the
[11:42] thing I'm doing the end time ahead that
[11:47] headstone comes down the body comes up
[11:52] and you see it's odd to me that
[11:55] Christian is ironclad
[11:58] you know that the Roman Empire has you
[12:03] even now we still hold a lot of customs
[12:05] of the Romans you know her oh yeah and
[12:07] and in the end time but this is all this
[12:09] is all spiritual you know so you know
[12:14] this this past Friday just to throw this
[12:17] in my boss at work we caught you called
[12:19] me into the office we were talking about
[12:20] some things about the budget and and he
[12:23] said hey do you see where the Pope said
[12:24] there's no help yeah and apparently the
[12:27] Pope had seen that said no I didn't see
[12:29] that but he said yeah we just need to
[12:31] started to run me some things on fox
[12:33] news and stuff and and there was
[12:35] something where supposedly the the
[12:37] people around the Pope you know that
[12:41] those they are the priests and things
[12:43] they're saying no that's not what the
[12:45] Pope said but the public sayings that
[12:47] that that hell is a place where there's
[12:52] no there's no there's no suffering for
[12:55] the soul there's just the destroying of
[12:56] the soul it's what is what he was saying
[12:58] supposedly and I told I told my boss I
[13:01] said I said well Aaron his name is Aaron
[13:04] I said you know that's actually not far
[13:05] from the truth and he said I he said
[13:09] what do you mean so I said well I said
[13:15] because there is a destruction of the
[13:17] soul I said in order for you to have to
[13:21] suffer in a in a Hell eternally you have
[13:24] to have eternal life and the Bible says
[13:26] that the soul that sinneth it shall
[13:28] surely be destroyed it also says that
[13:30] hell will be thrown into the lake of
[13:33] fire and it will be no more so how can
[13:35] he'll be eternal how can that how can a
[13:38] sinner soul be eternal they has to have
[13:41] the same life that God has and I asked
[13:43] him I said well where's the source of
[13:44] eternal life and he said well God I said
[13:46] how can the Son of God in a sinner have
[13:49] the same source of life but one's
[13:51] burning for eternity and one's with God
[13:53] for eternity and he just kind of looked
[13:55] at it that way when I was in the Baptist
[14:07] Church you know the hell is the eternal
[14:09] place but I mean Hell itself will cease
[14:12] to exist so you know you kind of claim
[14:16] that little seat they're moving emails
[14:18] he was the one that asked all right so
[14:24] this so in Daniel 2:35 when when when
[14:29] when he was Daniel seeing this image
[14:32] that we just looking at
[14:33] he was this says this then was the iron
[14:35] the clay the brass the silver and the
[14:37] gold broken to pieces together and
[14:39] became like the chaff of the summer
[14:41] threshing oats in other words the wind
[14:44] just kind of took the shaft and the wind
[14:46] carried them away that no place was
[14:48] found for that's right
[14:49] there's no there was not going to be any
[14:50] place for these kingdoms they were
[14:52] established here on earth and the stone
[14:54] that smote the image became a great
[14:56] mountain amen that stone as Jesus cried
[15:00] right they became a great mountain and
[15:03] filled the whole earth amen
[15:06] that's why and that's that that stone
[15:09] fits in you a man that kingdom you shall
[15:13] have possession of your whole heart
[15:14] right and in Daniel 2:44 just a few
[15:17] verses down says and in the days of
[15:19] these kings so that God of heaven set up
[15:21] a kingdom now look how it says it says
[15:24] in the days of these kings that means in
[15:27] this time and these days that the Satan
[15:30] was setting up his earthly Kingdom shall
[15:34] the God of heaven set up a kingdom how
[15:37] can that be because he's sitting there
[15:39] sitting in and giving me everything it's
[15:42] it starts God doesn't have to make it
[15:45] big and loud and you know he knows what
[15:49] he's doing he's helped set up a kingdom
[15:52] which shall never be destroyed and the
[15:55] Kingdom shall not be left to other
[15:56] people but it shall break in pieces
[15:59] consume all these kingdoms and it shall
[16:02] stand forever everybody praise God
[16:06] alright can we read Daniel 7:13 to 27
[16:11] real quick if you have your Bibles let's
[16:13] turn there I don't know about these
[16:24] things but they think these things
[16:25] excite me give me because you know we're
[16:29] hearing this earth and we just want to
[16:31] get out we wanna you know really when
[16:33] people say I want to get out but really
[16:35] I want to possess this parent the way it
[16:38] was originally meant to be look we're
[16:39] not gonna be up in heaven in a cloud now
[16:42] you know this is our heaven here it just
[16:48] needs to be really a remodel really I'm
[16:57] in Satan's got control over it so Daniel
[17:01] and past the Book of Daniel Daniel
[17:04] chapter 7 starting at verse 13 look what
[17:14] it says here it says I saw this is
[17:18] Daniel speaking now I saw in the night
[17:20] visions and behold one like the son of
[17:22] man
[17:23] now where is it that we see something
[17:26] like that later on in the in the Bible
[17:28] right it was in the book of Revelation I
[17:31] saw a one like the son of man came with
[17:34] the clouds of heaven and came to the
[17:36] Ancient of Days and they brought him
[17:39] near before him and there was given him
[17:42] Dominion and glory in the kingdom that
[17:45] all people nations and
[17:48] this should serve him his Dominion is an
[17:51] everlasting Dominion which shall not
[17:53] pass away and his kingdom that would
[17:57] that which shall not be destroyed and
[18:00] 5015 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit
[18:04] in the midst of my body and the visions
[18:06] of my head troubled me I came near unto
[18:09] one of them that stood by and asked him
[18:11] the truth of all this so he told me and
[18:14] made me know the interpretation of the
[18:16] things these great beasts which are four
[18:19] are four kings which shall rise out of
[18:22] the earth right because he saw in the
[18:25] vision some beasts as well but the
[18:28] Saints of the Most High listen to this
[18:30] but the Saints of the Most High shall
[18:31] take the kingdom and possess the kingdom
[18:35] forever even forever and ever you know
[18:39] here in the Book of Daniel is the only
[18:41] place where where you see that word that
[18:43] that outside of the Bible outside of the
[18:46] New Testament in the Book of Daniel is
[18:48] the only place where it said it mentions
[18:49] the word Saints so that's gotta be me so
[18:58] you have to see yourself in the
[18:59] scripture amen right that's me amen
[19:02] but the Saints of the Most High shall
[19:04] take the kingdom and possess the kingdom
[19:05] forever even forever and ever
[19:07] then I would know the truth of the
[19:09] fourth beast which was diverse from all
[19:11] the others exceeding dreadful whose
[19:14] teeth were of iron and his nails of
[19:16] brass which devoured breaking pieces and
[19:18] stamped the residue with his feet of
[19:21] course we know this song represent a
[19:23] religious right of the ten horns that
[19:25] were in his head and of the other which
[19:26] came up and before whom three fell even
[19:29] up that horn that had eyes and a mouth
[19:31] that spake very great things whose look
[19:33] whose look was more stout than his
[19:36] fellows I beheld and the same horn made
[19:40] war with the Saints and prevailed
[19:42] against them so there was that was a
[19:45] particular time where this this Empire
[19:47] and there's a Roman right he made war
[19:50] with the Saints he killed him you know
[19:53] and he had rebelled against him
[19:56] physically here on earth until he
[19:59] verse 22 until the Ancient of
[20:01] came in judgment was given to the Saints
[20:04] of the Most High
[20:06] there's that word Saints again and the
[20:08] time came that the Saints possessed the
[20:10] kingdom amen thus he said the for me
[20:14] shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth
[20:16] which shall be diverse from all kingdoms
[20:18] and shall devour the whole earth and
[20:21] shall tread it down and break it in
[20:22] pieces all right o verse 27 and the ten
[20:26] horns out of this kingdom are ten Kings
[20:28] that shall arise and another shall arise
[20:30] after them and he shall be diverse from
[20:32] the first and he shall subdue three
[20:34] kings and he shall speak great words
[20:36] against the most high and shall wear out
[20:38] the Saints of the Most High and think to
[20:41] change times and laws and they shall be
[20:44] given unto his hand until a time and
[20:47] times and the dividing of time natural
[20:49] know we can go into all the details of
[20:51] that but by the way this mentioned this
[20:54] this goes on to Daniel 17 week - that's
[20:56] right but the judgment shall sit and
[20:58] they shall take away his Dominion to
[21:01] consume and destroy it unto the end and
[21:04] the kingdom and Dominion and the
[21:06] greatness of the kingdom under the whole
[21:08] heaven shall be given to the people of
[21:11] the saints of the Most High whose
[21:14] kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and
[21:16] all dominions shall serve and obey Him
[21:19] hitherto so we leave it there so that
[21:24] just shows that the Saints are destined
[21:27] to take over the kingdom that's right
[21:29] all these thinking de me see Washington
[21:31] DC Rome Manila in the Philippines
[21:36] managing Colombia South America all
[21:39] these kingdoms there they're gonna cease
[21:41] one day ever and we're gonna take over
[21:45] the way it was originally
[21:47] but again we take the week with we don't
[21:51] take Cobra if we don't possess our own
[21:53] vessel first
[21:55] all right brother Branham says in the
[21:59] future home God already took up his
[22:01] abode potential all right
[22:04] yes and that new verse soul the kingdom
[22:07] of God is in the earth now right right
[22:10] in the hearts of his Saints
[22:13] it's his attributes that he began in the
[22:16] beginning now his attributes is redeemed
[22:20] even meat now redeem what's he waiting
[22:23] to redeem the earth trying to set his
[22:27] attributes on it I thought we're already
[22:29] on it yeah but we're not on it with full
[22:33] power like it I'd like like Adam had his
[22:35] attributes on it to fulfill exactly his
[22:38] predestinated plan given do you see it
[22:41] yes and then in the Christ mystery of
[22:43] God revealed brother and says then our
[22:45] headship is a kingdom yes hey men the
[22:50] kingdom of God is within you
[22:52] he said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we
[22:54] are not a denomination we belong to a
[22:56] kingdom and the Kingdom is is the word
[23:00] of God made spirit and life in our own
[23:03] life bringing to pass every promise in
[23:06] this day as it did in that day when the
[23:09] Word of God was one yeah and the Word of
[23:12] God is one in his church today if you
[23:16] have that birth in your soul making it
[23:18] the headship of the body that is
[23:20] redeemed to bring the message in the
[23:23] last day and be taken up from the dead
[23:26] in the resurrection to go back and
[23:29] restore again as Adam and Eve in the
[23:31] beginning in the Garden of Eden the
[23:33] three full mission of God his body
[23:38] that's all that's all God is interested
[23:41] in the truck his interest is mine
[23:45] interest right should be all that all
[23:47] the interest
[23:48] of the believers to set up this kingdom
[23:51] in full force okay with him being the
[23:55] fool in the head of it all that's right
[23:58] but the thing that stains is that he's
[24:02] not just sitting in a throne in which
[24:04] we're sitting on a throne with you know
[24:06] as well because what Bible says there
[24:08] where Kings increase great
[24:09] amen Manami said that I did say he said
[24:12] it about me so I believe it amen
[24:15] so originally when I started this series
[24:18] I asked the question is the kingdom of
[24:20] God is an external or internal and some
[24:23] of you might have said always entitled
[24:25] but to me the kingdom of God is both I
[24:29] say it's both because it has to begin
[24:30] entirely within you in order to manifest
[24:32] extra because that that's that's the
[24:36] full plan of redemption amen yeah I
[24:38] wasn't just to redeem internally mm-hmm
[24:42] but he wanted to manifest externally as
[24:44] well never know you see see God the
[24:47] Bible says that Jesus Christ when he was
[24:49] living here on earth he was the fullness
[24:51] of the Godhead but that body that he
[24:55] lived in wasn't my team wasn't wasn't it
[24:58] was still it still had headaches it
[25:00] still could it was probably was tempted
[25:03] to think bad things because the Bible
[25:06] says that Jesus was tempted in all
[25:07] things such as we are tempted yes right
[25:10] could have been tempted with with with
[25:13] with with lusting for women and things
[25:16] like that
[25:17] why not but he never sinned yes right
[25:20] that was the thing he conquered all that
[25:23] externa try it but it came from within
[25:25] right man
[25:27] so he was he was it was he was the
[25:29] fullness within yes right
[25:31] we are the fullness within right yes
[25:33] right
[25:34] I mean potentially that's what that's
[25:36] what that's what that's what he is right
[25:38] now even Jesus Christ had to die yes and
[25:41] that body had to be redeemed yes that's
[25:44] right
[25:44] and so as as he came up with power and
[25:47] that bodies redeemed
[25:48] amen then our bodies gonna be real
[25:50] as well madra not a new body right
[25:53] because the same buddy that went down in
[25:55] that drave is the same money they came
[25:57] up a man right it's not it wasn't a
[26:00] different total body no the same thing
[26:02] with you and I Amen we go down in the
[26:04] grave it's gonna be the same one coming
[26:07] out with the truck just fully rid the
[26:08] begging amen
[26:10] lots of lots of looking forward to some
[26:13] things I don't tell off to read with me
[26:14] of dis read with me here he can read it
[26:17] the Lord's Prayer in Matthew 6 verse 9
[26:21] and I'll read every duh the first person
[26:25] can read verse 10 and we'll just take
[26:26] turns and read the last verse together
[26:28] after this manner therefore pray ye our
[26:30] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[26:32] thy name
[26:39] give us this day our daily bread
[26:46] altogether and lead us not into
[26:48] temptation but deliver us from evil for
[26:52] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[26:55] the glory forever pretty tough babe
[27:01] Daniel had already seen that expecting
[27:06] them was his amen praise God does
[27:08] anybody have any questions or any
[27:10] comments about about anything we talked
[27:16] about
[27:18] amen so their kingdom Saints the kingdom
[27:23] of God isn't just isn't just the
[27:26] external man isn't just about having
[27:31] long hair and about wearing decent
[27:34] clothes and about the Pharisees had all
[27:36] that that's right
[27:37] Pentecostals have done that yeah you
[27:40] know there's more to this than just that
[27:43] those things are important but don't put
[27:46] that before before before the new birth
[27:48] and put that before the scripture before
[27:51] the Bible anything and so it's not just
[27:56] the external say man it's internal in
[27:59] order to start on the outside amen
[28:01] nice about sister truth that's that's
[28:16] very true you know and that that's one
[28:18] thing that you know you have a you get
[28:21] very prideful you know but you know cuz
[28:25] I I can show it on the outside that's
[28:29] fine you can start on the outside but
[28:31] God looks at you inside it know what's
[28:35] in that what's on the inside
[28:37] you know it's what counts right that
[28:41] sees definitely no yeah you read any of
[28:45] the 235 is that
[28:51] New Jerusalem is yeah well that in in
[28:57] there in Revelation in Revelation New
[28:59] Jerusalem the bride types New Jerusalem
[29:01] because the Bible says that in
[29:04] Revelation that that that was it others
[29:08] say when he comes down that city who
[29:10] comes down out of heaven as a brother as
[29:12] a bride adorned waiting for her or her
[29:15] husband and so yeah America just as the
[29:20] glory of God fills the earth but we're
[29:22] sitting on the same throne with
[29:23] hanatronic we filled the whole earth as
[29:25] well do you see what I'm saying
[29:27] yes that's but if that's where you're
[29:29] trying so I mean we're and you think
[29:31] about it this way to you know we're
[29:33] supposed to travel as a thought yes
[29:35] right yes I at that point what
[29:39] limitations can you have there's no
[29:41] limitations if I want to be with with my
[29:43] brothers and sisters or in Africa I can
[29:47] be you know but we had full possession
[29:53] here now me because God entrusted us
[29:55] with it all you know we can be and so we
[29:57] have full possession air with all the
[29:59] earth you know I just kind of see it
[30:01] that way you know but there's some other
[30:04] things involved in there but you know it
[30:06] there's no limitations to what is there
[30:09] limitations to God there's no
[30:11] limitations to us when Louise she got
[30:14] seven overcoming one for each age
[30:17] Revelation chapter 21 there's an eighth
[30:22] Revelation chapter 20 over six that it
[30:25] is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[30:26] beginning and this is when the new City
[30:28] you've done your city to come down I
[30:30] will give unto them visitors back to the
[30:32] water of life freedom he that overcometh
[30:34] shall inherit all things and I will be
[30:39] his God and he shall be my son that's it
[30:42] that's number eight that's in that
[30:44] that's in the because you got your in
[30:46] the sevens you still got limitation in
[30:47] the sevens of in the
[30:49] that's rather later Joe you got he that
[30:52] overcometh will I give this will I give
[30:54] there's a piece that you get this says
[30:56] all things a man and I will be their God
[30:59] they'll be monkey that's the eighth
[31:03] overcoming I've always found that rope
[31:05] number eight trying to find it but that
[31:08] is up there that's never the city sits
[31:10] down that's because we've received all
[31:14] amen well you look at it also when
[31:17] Christ that when Christ resurrected on
[31:20] the eighth day that's right that's right
[31:24] that's eternal under there that's all
[31:27] power then he said he said all power is
[31:29] given unto me both in heaven and earth
[31:31] because really non eternity is eternity
[31:34] is not gonna happen to let new shitty
[31:35] sits down anywhere that's the eighth
[31:38] everything else is in the seven even the
[31:40] thousand years even the white throne
[31:43] judgment is in time yes the new CD
[31:47] that's great day only begins when God
[31:49] watch everything off killed all the
[31:51] demons puts everybody where they need to
[31:53] go then open the city sets down that's
[31:56] when he says he that overcometh will I
[31:59] give all that let me ask you this good
[32:01] brother brandy said Brown said heaven
[32:03] and earth will come together and that is
[32:06] that that heaven that New Jerusalem
[32:08] comes down inmates could you say that
[32:11] heaviness that New Jerusalem yeah well
[32:14] you go work having a Turkish kissed you
[32:16] go back in the Book of Psalms see that
[32:18] first time happen is when Jesus came to
[32:20] earth heaven what was inside of him on
[32:23] earth the man men that's the way it is
[32:25] now that's a new birth heaven and earth
[32:27] meet so it's not just all on him and
[32:30] it's not just gonna happen in the future
[32:31] like you said this kingdom will never be
[32:34] understood no it's not given with
[32:37] observation the Bible said so in other
[32:38] words you can go observe the United
[32:40] States Constitution Bill of Rights you
[32:42] can understand that government rust you
[32:44] can understand that this government
[32:46] people in your life know they were
[32:48] having never well understanding that is
[32:51] years ago absolutely I mean he's a plan
[32:53] on the purpose
[32:54] he's gonna do this it's a kingdom and
[32:57] that's why I believe was Peter or Paul
[33:00] that said the natural man doesn't
[33:02] understand the things like God right
[33:04] right the natural man thinking about
[33:07] natural kingdoms and about natural
[33:09] things in their life doesn't understand
[33:12] the spiritual things that God because to
[33:13] him it's not it's not revealed to see
[33:16] that's why Pilate kept asking Jesus it
[33:19] they say you're a king you got a kingdom
[33:22] in Kingdom Kingdom and he said but this
[33:23] hand I was born but Pilate knew that
[33:25] that man standing in front of him had no
[33:27] power in the state he was in so he
[33:30] wasn't scared
[33:31] he didn't say kid and he saw ladies
[33:32] don't people come in here all the time
[33:35] telling me they gonna take over look at
[33:36] this cutter you know everybody's left
[33:38] him used to anybody else right but he
[33:41] just didn't say that he the actions of
[33:45] Pilate though brought the kingdom into
[33:46] being as bad to kill Jesus we went out
[33:49] that's right so then did you brought the
[33:51] kingdom that's right
[33:52] but if Pilate would have recognized and
[33:55] we read that scripture where Isis told
[33:56] him and said My Kingdom is not affirmed
[33:58] this month he told Pilate that that's
[34:01] right and he was Pilate was right there
[34:02] looking at the kingdom at the kingdom of
[34:06] God right there couldn't recognize it
[34:09] that's right the natural man does not
[34:11] see even if they are seeing it they
[34:13] don't see it it's right because it has
[34:15] to be revealed
[34:16] amen praise the Lord well the kingdom
[34:19] was established on Friday when they
[34:20] killed Jesus the darkest hour that they
[34:22] thought you know they were getting rid
[34:23] of this heretic but that's when you came
[34:26] to became established today actually but
[34:30] it began he had to diverge that's right
[34:32] so he had to be killed without
[34:35] resurrecting that killing with a man no
[34:37] different that's interesting you said
[34:39] that because I'm gonna see
[34:40] kingdom of God doesn't come it has to be
[34:44] yet there has to be victory there first
[34:46] there has to be suffering right just as
[34:49] Jesus suffered we have to suffer with
[34:52] that ground there of our bit all right
[34:55] that's our bill of rights for payment
[34:57] that's right that gives us the right and
[35:00] Father amen but remember the cornerstone
[35:05] the fountain the foundation is the same
[35:08] thing as the heads are not correct
[35:10] Jesus Christ that's right the whole
[35:12] thing is Jesus Christ us to read in
[35:19] internal-external because we have to
[35:21] take it internally and then we step into
[35:23] it yeah yeah that's true sometimes they
[35:28] say they say the 10-second rule or the
[35:31] truly encounter 5 yeah and before
[35:34] you get to 5 and get out you know hey
[35:37] man as you get older you have to get up
[35:39] in ships anyway Briony is still there I
[35:46] think it already is a resurrection
[35:55] yeah you will
[35:57] but I do still struggle getting up
[35:59] because I just that's not one of my
[36:01] Forte's you know I want to learn how to
[36:05] do it it's more like five hours counting
[36:09] all right with Lord bless y'all Thank
[36:12] You Aaron to be named
