brother pageants then uh that'll be what this is May June the July the third Saturday in July so just thank the Lord for that amen all right let's go right on the end brother Tom for Shane he's right up here to the front let's get him to come up and get his family and all of them to come and they want us to come to sing for us praise the Lord it's real good to be here it's good to see everybody coming in it's a great message that we are in it's one of the most astounding things there the most astounding thing to ever hit my life you know I never knew there would come a day when I would prefer to hear the preaching of the Plan of Redemption better than if we had 50 experts to teach me how to be a better man I would rather hear the word preached over a four week period than to have 50 experts on Behavior to make me a better man because once you're done with all those experts you might do okay during their teaching but then when they're done you're done but when you're taught these things that feed your soul and it becomes a part of you it's never done because it's eternal you know I I knew of a fella he went to prison in in one prison he went they didn't alarm to drink or to smoke and they had been a drinker and a smoker most of his life for the next 18 months he didn't drink or smoke and that's pretty good but then they transferred them to a different prison that allowed smoking and within a week he was back to smoking I know why because that Spirit was still there and the message of the hour is not for the carnal mind it doesn't even make sense and it's it's actually including the Bible I'll say with it filled with things that don't make sense to the carnal mind it just is you look up on the internet and there's thousands of websites about the mistakes in the Bible but see that's the carnal realm and that's where they're thinking where we are have gained such a strength that we are surviving as God feeds our spiritual man you know I just wanted to read one scripture is that okay and I'll just take a couple minutes but it a scripture that had struck me just recently of course I turned to the wrong one it's that over 50 thing over 50 thing let me just quick read it therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let's go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead Works into Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism of laying on the hands and of the of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit but I have learned that the message of the hour was not a Revival of the do's and the don'ts because that was the original Foundation that a sinner needed to know that they shouldn't do this and they ought to get away from this so that they could receive Christ but brother sister were waiting on a Rapture Amen in the rapture we have to lay those principles down not that we stop those things but we do those things now because of the life that's in us I don't wake up in the morning go oh no should I pay tithes or not this week my wife doesn't say I wonder if I should cut my hair this week or not because although those are truths those are not things that the message is about right if that be sold in our Pentecostal brothers and some even Baptist churches are now laying that Foundation again it's actually a better Foundation than what they have right now they may have to lay again the same Foundation but not the Bride of Jesus Christ we're looking to get off this Earth and that's the next thing that's going to happen every single age that ever had a prophet the prophet was always rejected you know I I thought of theory Erasmus lately and someone mentioned him today but uh brother Thierry Rasmus went on to be with the Lord but he did a great work out in Africa in different places and and the government took notice of it and they called him Theory Erasmus Branham and why because he was Affiliated so close to this message and I remember a couple few years back now my stepmom died and I was out in Virginia preaching and my family didn't know where I was and I didn't have a cell phone back in them days and so they said how do we even get to Tom so he can come to the funeral and I have a sister who's uh she's been taught against the message so she went up on the internet and looked up the name William Branham and and clicked on the First Church website she saw and she called the number that she saw and she said do you know where Tom Cruise Shane's well sure brother Tom's up in Virginia so if you type in the name William Branham on the internet you'll find me and that's fine with me isn't that good and she was astounded because uh there's there's got all Vindicated all the time just all the time and I asked the church to keep praying for my Amy she's she just stopped sleeping she stopped uh resting and after about three four five days of that her mind started slipping and just in and out she's been in the hospital now for five weeks and she's telling them all she's still healed and that she's a Christian and Every Time We Touch she says I'm a daughter of God and she's been talking to people there and I'll leave with one quick witness you know there they say she's obsessive but she's trying not to be but one woman there was talking openly about committing suicide and she had two children and my aiming got to talking well how about your children won't you miss your babies Oh yes I'll miss my babies and they kept talking and Amy said well you know she she said a few things her brother Brahms taught about it and she said you know if you do commit suicide how will your babies be able to miss you anymore and she began to talk and two days later they'd let that woman out and the medication team talked to her says well what made the change she said well really I talked to Amy crocheting and she told me a few things to encourage me and you know this message is so alive and I remember we went to visit her and we uh stopped by a coffee shop on the way back home and my daughter Anna likes the coffee and so I didn't want to go but we went anyway and when we got in there we we paired over a meal and I noticed a young man sitting with the Bible and so did my daughter Sarah he had a Bible and a couple other books uh being really saved or something like that and I looked over and I took a tiny notice maybe he saw us praying and my daughter Sarah took notice of him and uh she bowed her head and she prayed she said dear Lord God if he's the seed of God would you have him come talk to us it seemed like about a minute later and I don't have it perfect but I have something like that a minute later he got up and he said hey I have to go to the outside or to the bathroom and would you hold all my stuff and he began to talk to sure we will so we went out when he come back I said young man why don't you just sit right there and we began to talk about the message of the hour for the next two hours this is very very and uh We've we found out he's in a rough situation his parents are divorced his mom's alcoholic he's having a rough time I says well what's your name he says well Caleb this is well Caleb your very own name tells me what you need and we began to tell him he says but there's no more miracles after the apostles and I'm like let me talk to you a few minutes and you know so maybe we'll see Caleb again so even in our hard times good things can come of it this message will hold us through but remember this message is it'll help you even in the carnal realm it'll make you a good clean living person if I couldn't get the Holy Ghost I'd still be in the message because it's a better life but the message of the hours to feed your soul you actually leave behind that old fella named Tom Christian that's the one I want to leave him behind because some things you can't quit but you can't leave them behind and if you're leaving behind and you press towards the great things of God that's why I can't wait to hear the preaching because the preaching fills my mind in my heart with the things of God and then I can press forward and then I think on good things amen so it's real good to be here I just love brother Dale and uh I love all of you and I thank you and I could just cry out of gladness to see the sacrifice that some of you have made even to get here and you know it's a curvy road we go down in this life but uh it's going to be worth it at the End Amen it's even worth it now come on up uh young ones I guess we have a song so if you can remember Amy in prayer foreign thank you there's a lot of arrangement going around in this world the world's arranging for that Council of churches the bride's arranging to worship God the men fivefold Ministry is arranging to perfect the saints of God aren't you glad a Prophet come in this day amen amen to me it's all kind of about this song I guess oh yeah foreign I want us it was Grace that taught My Heart To Fear and Grace my fears release how precious his Mercury he will my shielding portion be as long as life endures my dreams are gone I got my savior is Amazing Grace Amazing Grace the Earth shall soon dissolve like snow the Sun for Bears will be forever will be forever forever amen amen and amen that's right isn't it brother Tony come on up we will have to tell brother Homer that brother Tom Christian got here at two o'clock and for him not to say no more praise God I just want to thank God Amen It's been a little struggle and um I trust that the spirit of God brought us to this far the holy spirit will continue to lead us amen right now um the spirit of God leading the bride into Perfection like our brother said and giving us the grace to be able to overcome every challenge that come in our way amen will you say Amen so I really want to give thanks to God for my family especially for his grace I see my case growing and my wife and Ben the years I moved here in Atlanta and different things that the Lord is doing I just want to thank him I want to just take this opportunity to thank the Lord amen amen the Lord has been good to me when um I don't have insurance by the grace of God and um God's sake a few months ago it was really bad and uh I didn't have insurance but I have blessed Russians amen so I trusted God and uh I was taken to the emergency um really sick and then before they got me the the car was really broken and uh I prayed I prayed a prayer to the Lord I said Lord I know you can heal right you were the same yesterday today and forever so I trusted God and I went to the emergency praying trusting God by the time the doctor came and he examined everything he said you all right I don't need to give you no medication and I told my wife that the Lord healed me and so

the only one there if there'd been some others we had somebody else singing but it's really not that it's not about me not about us it's about him you know and and do we do what we do to glorify him yes and that's the only reason I'm here if it doesn't glorify the lord it's a failure so um I I had two songs on my heart and this one has blessed me so many times and I believe it has you so I want

there's no reason for you to go straight don't you lean to your understanding me just lean on him and we'll all say that we've been made more than conquerors Overcomers in this life through the blood

made more than Congress Overcomers through the blood of Jesus Christ through the blood of Jesus Christ foreign I guess that's all of the churches the ministers okay you know we we had brother Ernie Villanueva scheduled to be with us this weekend and to preach for us but he was not able to come and uh so we had to get someone else and we're glad to always that somebody can help us and Minister for us and things you don't do and we appreciate it but what we're going to do today is uh you know if we're not going to take up another offering because I'm not one of those kind of guys you know people say well let's take up an offer to this and up and offer that of an offering this nothing first thing you know you got four or five offerings but what we're going to do the offering that was given today brother Ernie is not able to work because of what they call the neuropathy or something with his feet that he's not able to travel to do anything and uh you know we have I know churches have helped him we have helped him and he thanks God for all of that but what we'll do is when you were leaving tonight the offering plate parents will be holding it back there and if you have anything else the offering that you gave will go to brother Ernie you know to try to help him some and and bless him you know and all and take care of his needs but he said I talked to him the other day we had waited and waited and prayed and prayed and the last time I talked with him he said it was even a problem to try to go even to the grocery store because your feet goes numb and uh you don't know what's going on in them and they hurt const leaf with what they say with that so if you pray for him hold him up Let the Lord would bless him but we will send him the offering from today from everybody you know the fellowship meeting people so if you have anything else you want to give just make sure you do if you want to make a check out or anything to go ahead and make it out to a spoken word church and we'll make sure that it's handled and given unto him you know because that would would be all right okay but we appreciate the opportunity of you of coming here and being in the service today and pray that the Lord would bless each and every one of us you know we're living as someone said a moment ago we're living in some horrible times and things are going wrong all around the world but the worst problem is that we're living in a time when people are turning against the word you know and and actually turning down this message and those who used to swear by it and brought many of us into this message are the ones now that are saying it was wrong and how false the prophet is and the things like that but you know what they wouldn't dare say that when he was yes sir and uh I'm kind of like this I'm still to the point that I'm just old-fashioned enough to think that either this message is right or wrong and as long as I believe it to be right then I'm going to stand up for it and I'm going to say those who do not believe it or have got their problems not me because they didn't give it to me and they can't take it from me and you know if they come up with all these ideas that brother Brown was wrong here and wronged our well you know I just say to you and that's especially going out on the internet waves to the people and you go back and tell the people of brotherdale believes it that way you know if you can correct brother Brown and we need to follow you yep well if you can't see that's what that spirit is on the people the spirit on these preachers is wanting people to follow them no brother he's a good brother yeah he's a good lying hypocrite is any stronger I could make it that's as much as he's a good Pope come on but the Bible's right you know what it says said there must be a falling away first right will you think about that scripture you can't fall away if you ain't somewhere to fall from right you can't fall off of the Empire State Building unless you're on top of it and see the people that's been in this message are the ones now falling away well that's exactly scriptural but you said but those are good Brothers so it's a pope I put them all in the same category no difference they're good people sure we're all human but if this message is right let's follow it and forget the rest of it because I've never found the wrong in it amen me either I'll put it out there is a challenge on the internet come and show me come and show me where the Prophet was wrong well at least I'm trying to be honest come and show me well this or that come and show let's get together I think it's time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to stand up and do as brother Branham said he said I'll be glad when it comes a day that they'll look to people in the eye and say you're not saying what Paul said amen man why is it they don't come around here you know because they know they're not going to be welcomed right but you see that sister's honest as it can be straight as I can be in truth I can be about I believe the message we know brother random made human errors humans mistakes slips of the tongue sure because he was a human being and you do too and I do too you know but yet God sent us a message and if he didn't send this man then somebody's got to come so can't you see what all these preachers are doing they're building it back to themselves and that's between him and the Lord I just believe the message I ain't worried about it this message brought me to Jesus Christ and if the man turned out to be false is a three dollar bill I would still praise God for the message that brought me to Christ but then if I believe it's the message he brought me to Christ how can it be wrong Martin Luther was a trinitarian smoked a pot was sitting in a pub drinking beer talking about the Lord and said to Jews or to be took out and killed for Killing Jesus Christ but you know what I still believe the just shall live by faith I still believe what he taught of the truth don't you so do I about this message it has brought Christ to us because that is the point we did amen all mine's clear let's stand together we have Brother Richard Douglas brother Tim Humes Church the minister for us today and just pray that the Lord would bless him and give him the words that we would have for today because that's our desire to come together and fellowship around the word of the hour and to love him and to praise His great name because he's wonderful didn't he let's just saying Open the Eyes of My Heart as Brother Richard Douglas comes to minister the word of the Lord unto us this day
