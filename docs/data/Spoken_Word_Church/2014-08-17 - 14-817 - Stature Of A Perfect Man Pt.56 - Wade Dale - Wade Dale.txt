========================================

I start I know I'm sorry sorry getting that girl pretty she give not the little not the reindeer baby it's not Rudolph no not Rudolph okay we're going to go I've been wanting to go through sister Shepherd's dream because it is really really wonderful get back in now brother B is Blasphemous names he comes up and he he didn't explain at a statue of perfect man cuz I don't think he really um I'm sure he's understood the dream all right come on work hello hello hello hello don't get video so I want to read this now look paragraph 101 she she was worried about it so she laid down across the doo and this is Sister Shepherd she dreamed she was on a mountain and in this mountain the best I haven't got the paper before but I think it's like this cuz remember brother brandham seen the dream he's a prophet he saw the dream told her the interpretation all right she dreamed that she was she saw a rock box like a framework sitting right in top of this mountain okay now it can't sit you couldn't sit right here anybody see that it ain't FL it's right here that's where it was sitting right cuz head had come yet and she saw a large man her husband was behind her she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeves rolled up bailing the most pure water that she ever seen and pouring it to a box this Rock Box sitting on top of the mountain and The Rock Box would not hold the water it rolled right out over there and just boiled up all the trash and sticks may I say all the achens back to what we were just talking about it's boiling the this is boiling the achens out of our camp cuz to me these are the achens these are the things that we what did Ain do he did something he should not have done he knew better cuz remember God said don't take nothing destroy it all don't take anything right that's same thing with this how how are we going to have Temperance if we got that little root of bitter in us or our brotherly kindness if we got that little root of bitterness or something in you know we can't do that okay things still had turned on the Rock Box would not hold the water I want you to pay attention The Rock Box would not hold the water now brother I'm just going to explain what this is so listen it just boiled up all the trash and sticks now realize in your mind here's a guy standing on the mountain pouring water in a box and the box is boiling up with water but there's sticks and trash rolling out over that water in the water coming out see that's a type of God pouring the word in the water of the word and burn and taking all the trash out so we still have trash going up the pyramid yes just like I said there was an aching in the camp and he was already in the promised land so right here's the promised land Faith that's our Promised Land that's the faith Seed of Abraham that's our Promised Land circumcision not of the flesh but of the heart yes Hallelujah okay you say amen amen amen there you go okay and she was asked and B it out rolled down the mountain and it rolled over her feet feet means what Redemption feet means Redemption remember I preached the sermon of feet Footprints feet means Redemption possession possession you're exactly correct right and it rolled over her feet and she was standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her uhhuh uh got it didn't stick to her things come just don't let it stick to you that's right like sister John that we're talking about you know something may rise up in you but but if you if you if you put that in some kind of soil and and and let it yeah you in bad shape brother Brown said you can't help the thought coming but you just put it away right can't help the birds flying over your head but don't let them put make a nest in your head only it didn't stick to her and when she asked why the Box didn't hold it the man said that is not water that's the Holy Ghost all right you I said it was a word but a't the Holy Ghost the word okay so I'm not saying something brother R didn't say all right the Holy Ghost is the word the word is the Holy Ghost the only way you're going to get the word is to have the Holy Ghost and then who burns it out the Holy Ghost Burns it out by the reveal word all right I want to say reveal word cuz not by the word cuz the letter kill it all right it's by the reveal word that's right this is not water that's the Holy Ghost now you know who that man was don't you that man was brother Brown the man up there pouring the water in was brother rown he was the only one that was able at that moment to teach that woman how to get up that statue of perfect man right God through brother Brandon through the Holy Ghost he was pouring that water in and said then he went back and got another big bucket and it was full of honey then now brother Brown goes and gets the bucket he's the only one that can preach brotherly kindness the way it should have been cuz that's what that honey is right now it will hold this he poured the honey into the bucket and she thought that the box was a rock box was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and held it everybody imagining this I I imagine a box sitting on top of a mountain got pouring water in and it's just leaking everywhere water's coming all over the place you're not amening right all over the place and then all of a sudden he goes gets another bucket of Honey pours the honey in and you know what honey does I do we do honey lines everything man it goes in every hole every crevice every crack and seals it up right my question is so can we say that that brotherly kindness lets you be able to be filled with the word exactly if you don't have that's what I'm getting to quit preaching the sermon if you this a lot l i I told y'all brother the kindness was the key did I not all this depends on this coming that's right you got to be here before The Headstone can come that's right it can't come down here cuz look that won't fit it's too little it'll fit right there but Buddy it'll fit right there right right on that brotherly kindness that's why I'm telling you brotherly kindness is the most important cuz that's where that's the difference between all the other ages and that head Stone coming down now brother brandham they said brother brand you couldn't tell who his enemy or who his friends were he had brotherly kindness he's he couldn't stand up and preach that without having it now Peter did Peter James and John and Paul had brotherly kindness they had the Holy Spirit melding it together but they didn't have enough of the word to bring that okay this is the opening of the seals this is Brother R's message a pyramid inside of the pyramid this is the prophet's message right here that's what he come to bring he said not in the years of restoration got it not in the year this is restoration people's already had this this is not something new that we're going to get that nobody else has the first church age had brotherly kindness right all these virtues were working in the book of Acts if you want to see the pyramid work read the book of Acts that's why we went back and read the book of Acts where they had all things common they brought all the money in and they let Peter James and them Distributing the money out and that's because they had brotherly kindness it wasn't like well I don't know what they're going to do with that no they trusted that brother with the Holy Ghost to do that because he had all these other things working in his life now look if they would have perceived that he didn't have knowledge or patience Peter James and him didn't have all these I wouldn't give it to them either they weren't a novice when they received the Holy Ghost 120 in the upper room receed the Holy Ghost they were right here cuz Jesus himself the word preached to them every day for 3 and 1/2 years and it had an effect on them they held it the Bible said they took the word and held it they didn't you know you you seem outwardly that Peter wasn't getting it cuz Peter was always messing up but something inside of Peter was getting it because if not God wouldn't have put him the first man standing on the porch right and he wouldn't have definitely trusted with the keys cuz he told him he said Peter whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven now what a responsibility Peter had so on the day of Pentecost he walks out says repent brothers and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins key clicked down here key clicked up there and God said you're not getting up here without that that's what he said okay now we know man's ideas turned into father son Holy Ghost and all those things and God winked at that ignorance but the reason brother Brown come brought that message he did from 47 to 63 was to get us back to brotherly kindness where we could understand understand how to handle the word of God cuz remember power without character you can have power power without character is satanic right W cuz you're going to use it wrong that's right but Power with character you'll be able to use it right okay that's what brother rown was mean when he said power without character satanic he was actually I believe in his mind he was thinking of the virtues Godly virtues not human I'm talking about God sent virtues we are not going to get finished this today I don't know why in the world we're R I'm rambling so much look at done she saw let's see she turned and went down the mountain going down the mountain she stopped at the bottom of the mountain and looked up look back she saw five streams of pure Crystal Water not contaminated by the things that it went through still pure and clear coming swiftly then it slowed up then almost fading out and she was wondering would it ever reach the bottom of the mountain five streams and she woke up she said sister I think that's about as close as to be no more than he picked the letter up he saw the dream all right that's the way dreams are interpreted and he tells that did everybody understand that a real Prophet if you go tell him a dream before he interprets that dream he actually sees the same dream you see and then God can interpret it that way you know he's a prophet cuz and cuz cuz what brother remember many times brother brandom said I tell the people they left this out why'd you leave that out why'd you leave this out why' you leave that out why because brother R standing there seeing the whole dream and they're over here telling him the part they want him to see so you know he's seeing the whole dream because remember if a dream comes from God God don't just take and do like we do and hit delete right well that's forever there it's in an archive somewhere right and the prophet just pulls it out of that archive and he sits there just like a television screen he sits right here and watches that dream so he's watching ing her dream well I believe that's in the scripture in Daniel he's talking about Daniel's time dreaming and he he talks on I don't mean skipping this but we need to now here's the interpretation of her dream she was bothered about the Holy Spirit now in so much as she seen the Box on top of the mountain was the rock rock Box Rock means what confession all right now like Jesus said in scripture said Peter who does man say I the son of man am one says El Li one says Moses said but who do you used I am th are the Christ son of the Living God some people say that he's talking about the Catholic Church what The Rock was the Roman Catholic Church says it was Peter right but it's not it was that rock confession all right not to be disagreeable but my way of sin it's both wrong he never built it on Peter did he build it on himself but he built it on Peter's revelation of who he was who does man say I son of my am th Christ son of living God blessed thou Simon son of Jonah flesh and blood has not revealed this to you some s but my Father which is in heaven th Peter Upon This Rock of confession upon this Revelation I'll build my church and that's been each Church age has had that rock confession on top to this rock confession of the L out of which is our age right now he cannot make a holy church there's no such name as a holy church he talkinging about the Catholic our holy organization the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad Renegades indifferent everything else so an organization will not hold right so therefore for the rock this Latter Day Pentecostal Church which has received the Holy Spirit they did like they did at the first all down Through the Ages so see he's not talking about Pentecostal denomination right he's talking about true Pentecost everybody's had if you're born again you had a true Pentecostal experience just like they had on the day of Pentecost but you were part of that 3,000 downstairs that were Spirit babes in Christ everybody understand that you weren't the 320 you weren't born you weren't birth with all these virtues working in your life they have to be walk through journey of Life conquered they have to be conquered you're right right they did like they did it first all down Through the Ages they receive the Holy Spirit but not in the measure that they have it now because it's a restoration of the first Alpha and Omega right as we take the candlesticks Alpha and Omega how they lit the first candle it went higher higher got dimmer and dimmer then come back again first and last so forth now but in this church age the message is being poured into the church but the church body itself all together like the this Tabernacle will say that's where she comes to church this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there is no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in the body of group therefore it runs out but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church so he's identifying who it is it's him okay the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it that's what the Holy Spirit does boils it up now now the honey represented brotherly love so now he's telling you what the honey is the Honey's brotherly love it's going to seal all this together cuz without brother brotherly glove this he calls this the true baptism now you say well then the other one was false we've had preachers tell us no gen Revelation says that Jesus Christ is the faithful and true witness not that he was false and then he become true it's just you're going to see more light of the truth everybody got that you're going to see more light of the truth that's right the faithful and true witness Jesus was never a false witness that's right saying that well now he's true well the same way with this right here excuse me now the honey represented Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is this age I just got through telling see of Brotherly kindness the age that we live in now now you might say look I sure don't like brother Neville I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother so and so something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart's broke just nearly kills you we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another see but to maintain in a group of people so what he's saying is hard to maintain in a group of people am I am I interpreting that okay that's right in a group of people it's hard to maintain brotherly love that's right why do you care for that brother because you've broken bread with him here at the altar as we will tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and you might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you just kind of stay what you ought and do but shun him a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would nearly kill you or that sister I'm an old man I was once young now I'm old I've seen it down Through the Ages do that hear people say I just want have no more to do with him and something happened to that man that nearly killed him thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks now in some months that she come from there down the hill to the bottom of the hill now this glorious water was gushing over Hills in five streams now five is the number of Grace j e s u s f a i t h g a c five is the number of Grace five streams is pouring from up here at the trough down through here see now when he says down through here in BL in Blasphemous names that chart was still up but if you'll keep reading Blasphemous names he'll refer back to this chart okay so he drew this and left it on the chalkboard all right that's what me and Daddy were talking about something the other day and talking about the ministers changing brother Brown's CH of Daniel 70 weeks to fit their Revelation well they've never change this one if brother R was writing one he's writing the other right he's not wrong brother right you just need a revelation each one of these ages had that rock confession I'm sure he's pointing each one these Saints are sleeping waiting waiting waiting waiting see until this age so he's pointing right here right on to this age but soon the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and seal up the church then the church will be raptured this all right now watch it be a complete unit of God a bride for Christ who will be the head of of all things which he's the head that's called a headstone remember we talking about last Sunday he was the Chief Cornerstone which is the same looking you know same looking Rock it's a pyramid down here is what goes up here you just got to go through these developmental stages right now she was wondering now in Her Dream she was wondering would this little stream ever get to the bottom see it was drying up now being that she herself now here it is what I want you to get to now she herself was wondering about her own self did she have the Holy now shun saying this a few days ago thinking the church would be spiritual enough to catch it when he was preaching The Testament for man and maybe I better turn this tape off right now cuz I don't want to get out this among Brethren but you can speak with tongues shout dance cast out Devils do anything you want to and still not have the Holy Ghost now them Pentecostal people they couldn't take that they could not take a prophet telling them that that's why they turned against and they can't today either okay cuz remember kyus was spiritual bam was spiritual so he said well I'm spiritual okay your fruits are going to show which Spirit you come from because the devil is the most spiritual person in any realm except God that's right in any realm the devil is the most spiritual person that's why this is the most deceiving age cuz it's come all the way down so close together that it would deceive the very elect if possible Lord many will come to me and say Lord I've cast out devils in your name do Mighty Works depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't know you everybody know what that word no means same one as when Adam knew his wife Eve so it's not a sexual relationship but a it is a union between a husband and wife I never knew you as a wife if he knows you as a wife you're his right so that's what the Bible's talking about depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't know you in other words the Bible says I never knew you that's the correct correct not correc in a prophet but he was paraphrased in scripture these things are not in indications of the Holy Spirit by their fruit you shall know them now you say brother BR we do should we speak with tongues absolutely but these gifts of God without these virtues listen the those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumble block to the unbeliever that's true listen to this it's not accepted by God that's a strong St I bet them Pentecostal people was red as that table their face was cuz see they build everything on them speaking in tongues shouting and all that stuff and he said it's not accepted by God you know what some of them said who's he to say it's not accepted by God but watch watch what he's saying watch how he goes down through here look this has to be first right what and when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he seals the church ages as a unit all right the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam the rib from the side here is the things you have to have first I'm sure he's pointing to this chart here is the things you have to have chur first you can't impersonate them you can't IM itate them they've got to be God sent and God born imitation only causes confusion that's right true all right power without character that's right could turn somebody away from this message you got the power the Holy Ghost is a power you got the Holy Ghost you got the power but without character it can be used against you okay I want to warn you power without character is satanic but Power with character it's fit to Ru there's your headstone isn't it amazing though that so many people are drawn to that Pentecostal same thing in the message they do it in the message all the time if you're not real Pentecostal they ain't going to have you we'll finish this next Sunday we need to going up brother Danny's with us today so give you some good amen
