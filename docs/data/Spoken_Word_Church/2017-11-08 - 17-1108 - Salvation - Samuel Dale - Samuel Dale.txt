be John tonight we're gonna start a new series okay we're not gonna quit on that it's just kind of changing the way of approach to God we're still gonna be on the calling it you know a title but we'll still be talking about the one God in the revealing of Almighty God because to me that's the entire Bible as in all things is a revealing of the Lord Jesus Christ revealing God so if you would go to Jonah - and we'll pick up from back very good to see where the Tom there with us we see sister Trudy she went through the operation yesterday and been out today helping her husband passing out food and things like that and then come to church tonight so that's doing pretty good so the might order to flip a little bit of fan on at least okay done got it taken care of okay all right I'm so close a little stuffy all right we now remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday of this month it'll be a brother Tony's will be leaving here about 1:30 I guess to try to get there by three o'clock we ought to be leaving at least by one if you want to go with us will won't be going and stopping and eating now we'll just be driving in because there's no need at that time of the day to stop and eat I mean just do that all these other announcements you've got the paperwork on it and if there's any goof-up it being a typology you know instead of the instead of us trying to do it okay but we just appreciate everything okay father we thank you for tonight you're loving your grace Lord and we thank you for all things and we just ask you Lord that you would call among us tonight that we could or just sit down for a little bit in the middle of the week and listen to you as you would meditate into our hearts and our thoughts and then our Lord that you would be the God of each one of our lives forgive our sins thank you for being with sister Trudy bringing her through that Lord and all making everything well and we prayed that you would give our strength and in the body and everything will be fine we love you and we thank you forgive us Lord for the many failures of our life cause we know we do failure but we want to stand completing you have your way in Jesus name Jonah - then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly now look see where that now and said I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou hurt us my voice in other words that means out of the deep it's not hail like as we talk about it because the word hail can be translated show Gahanna Hades it can mean the grave it can mean this that can be it was just like to him expressing how bad a situation that existed in were he with that alright far that hurt us excuse me for that hadn't cast me into the deep in the midst of the sea and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy ways passed over me he's just describing his journey and what happened and he was cast overboard by the men and the great fish swallowed him up you know and he's coming through and going down into the little the fish as it's eating in things and taking him to the depths of the ocean or to the mountains as you say in a second then I said I am cast out of thy side no I'd be pretty pretty bad to be down as low as you can go in the earth in the belly of a oil and be pretty easily to be able to say I kind of believe Lord I'm out of your side I'm not in your fellowship right now and I need something to take you know take place for thou had us cast me into the deep into the midst of the sea and the floods compassed me about all by billows in thy ways passed over me then I said I am cast out of that side yet I will look again toward thy holy temple now he was in the belly of the whale so he wouldn't wait he could look to the temple and like brother Adam said one day he just probably said okay I'm told and I'm supposed to look to the temple and I'm just gonna look that way and believe that that's the way you know and to do and do it and he says the waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains see as far as you can go down there the mountains out in the ocean you know the earth with her bars was about me forever yet has now brought my life from corruption o Lord my God look at him sitting down in the whales belly and he's talking about that the Lord has brought up his life from corruption when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee unto thy holy temple they that observed lying vanities forsake their own mercy in other words he calling everything around him a line vanity right that's the best way of saying it right but I will sacrifice unto thee now what now he's down there how's he gonna get would build him a fire and do all kind of no not exactly right but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord now then what happened in the Lord spake unto the fish vomited out Jonah upon the dry land you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we've kind of finished up the thought at least enough I hope to work you can understand what I say you know not what it's what brother Dale said now it's I believe the Word of God tells us the truth and we talked about it there that the Bible says you know in talking about mankind that he's a triune being he's a body a spirit and soul and Paul said that you know that it be held blameless before the Lord it takes that to make a man you're not complete without your body you wouldn't be complete you wouldn't be complete without having a spirit living within you you wouldn't be complete if you didn't have a soul so then the old sayings of a lot of the denominations is saying man didn't have a soul until the law came into being you know that would be totally out and I'm I'm gonna say it this way to her that you can think about it you say I never heard anybody talking anything about the soul didn't exist can I ask you a question have you ever heard the word soulless have you ever heard the word soulish okay that's exactly what the teaching was that man didn't have a soul until the law came and brought him to a position that he became a soulish one who would be an answers from a conscience part of him and it would make him a soulish well if mankind could believe that before what do they believe now all right but then we talked about that it's the truth of seeing the the Word of God as it was brought to us and has been brought to us in the last days of talking about that that triune being is a human being and he's his body he spirit and he so it takes that to make him alright it took that to make Almighty God in human flesh that body was a creation Hebrews 10 5 a body has now prepared me alright that spirit the prophet said was the spirit in sunder town and divers manners in spite through the prophets or by the prophets really it's in the prophets is the correct way and then to say that that soul was a very soul of God because this is very nature it's very makeup and I asked you you know a few times are could you see you could follow the body throughout the Bible you could follow maybe the Spirit of God throughout the the word but could you see the soul there as it was back during that Old Testament trying to be displayed what was it that turned David from being killed kept all those others what was it in the fiery furnace our down with the three Hebrew children and all like that it came into being the very soul of Almighty God to manifest himself among us alright then bringing that into the truth that we understand an or need ones at the end time by the truth that was brought to us and it's giving you a little bit then we're gonna drop this but I'm trying to get you to see the situation and then we'll start in Genesis and come on up with a little point on salvation alright and because I want to cover this salvation for the Old Testament salvation in the new he said no it's all the same there's a little bit of difference there now we've got to hold that point you know alright and if you if you listen it will help to understand were wrapped all right but we found that the prophet in his early ministry would use body soul as the second rim spirit as the center realm but then when he came on into the 65s in the opening of the word then from then on he taught it body spirit second rim soul the senator we're all the way through from the very beginning of the 4647 and all all the way through he always told that man had five senses to the body whatever he called a second rim there was five cents this memory reason conscious you know it see taste feel smelling here for the body its memory reason conscious etc for the second realm of mankind no because you don't reason with your body see you've got a spirit that's the difference and in bringing us to where we are and especially to the soul of mankind but he always gave the third rim of mankind he always gave that free will are you know free moral agency the right to accept or reject and see then that way he says now we can understand Matthew 24:24 they said in the last days they would be false Christ's people that would be anointed upon their spirit you see where you would would have you trouble trying to take your early ministry and anoint on your soul and do this that in the other it won't line up because the Bible never tells you you get a new soul but that's the way the people of the message touted the old two souls and all the exchange of the souls and everything let's see it can't be all right but if you can get the anointing on a man's spirit then he can be as dark as can be within his soul or inner being and still lost all right now because that puts him to be in that basis and I love it the way the Prophet said it he said God gave man a free moral agency and he said he made him like him you remember that quote made him like him made him with a choice made him the war he could accept or reject and by doing that then he would new he would go after the wrong thing and turnout and all mankind in would be lost the Scriptures will be right about morning sin che could say with an iniquity I know that's not scriptures totally together those two are but the other one that we're always quote you know and the Prophet who quoted morning sincerity nicholas fasting mothers wounds like it's going over in the in the song that's just a little okay now but getting the point of what we're talking about we talked about adam and eve in their situation how perfectly they were created there was no imperfection in eve to be able to blame anything upon something or some way that god made her different were that he could condemn her what if he made her different he can't condemn her and I'm complying i'm blood i've always been that way if he made her differ then he's responsible what he made no he made her with free free will a choice to make she made the choice and then she went after the rest of it alright now we've spent a lot of time talking about Adam and Eve okay now let's talk about mankind because God breathed into the nostrils he created Adam from a lump of clay and brought him up he was standing there he breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul right according to the scripture all right then he was lonely because Eve was still in theophany still not in the right place so what did he do he didn't reach down and get another piece of clay and dirt and make he took a rib from Adam and Adam said now this literally is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh since she'll be called woman woman means a man now has something that he can produce himself from you just think about what the word woman means what was Eve given to Adam for to reproduce Adam right now we're going we know when we talk about the the spoken word is to be what would bring in that's fine it'll make no difference we've been through all that okay you get tied up in that and you don't listen to what's being said Adam and Eve were created perfect and right the mankind wasn't created that way mankind Ian came because of the fallen condition so no matter who the player first baby coming from Eve no matter who it would be they'd be wrong let's see the words I like things like this I know you don't do that away but I have a way of just anchoring something down and saying okay now you dig around that stake oh you won't - you're gonna be here for a while Nicole see when you lay it down right then they can't argue with you about it all right so Adam and Eve was created perfect the wind scene entered the picture it polluted the wound of Eve because first was what what was the last thing we were talking about Eve mind or spirit her reasoning factors was polluted by the devil talking through the Beast and then the Act took place that's where the people of the message you know no wonder that mankind don't believe it you know the serpent seed is one of the major arguments of organized religion against us when no wonder all they know he didn't eat an apple she had sex acts with a beast it's all about us all the people but that was not the original sin but that tax was not the original sin I don't care if he's eaten apples he wasn't original sin the original sin was when Eve disbelieved God's Word and he told her not to eat of that tree he put to her spiritual being it clogged up all of those flus and everything and when they come out of it what could come from the wound of Eve no eternal life can come from the wound of Eve come on don't blow me away he said but what about Jesus what about it no connection to mama other than a naval core no connection other than the naval core don't try to blame it on this out of the other so just get the point he was polluted in her mind and then she went forth and done an original their act or the thing that took place all right see that way you can say the original sin was unbelief walk right over here I've invited you to do it why don't you do some of these things really deco do it sometimes I can get into it won't you find you a good Baptist and ask him what was original sin if he's anything talking word at all he'll tell you it's unbelief oh they'll argue the out for the situation but he'll tell you the original is unbelief why because everybody knows that's what it was except the people this master said the people of the message don't know what the bad does know about it and boy that hurts don't it and like feet have been able to talk to my mother and let her tell you about that my daddy told her what happened in the garden and he never heard of william branham there any no record really the ever even went to church as far as I know I don't know but he told her what happened a lot of people don't do that knew what happened physically but they didn't know what happened spiritually so we go we're trying to lay it out with Paul and what Paul was saying that Satan through his subtilty would be able to see the to real true church just like he did even the garden but their brother Dale we can't be deceived no you already are well you arguing about it you say yeah but but you just don't believe it right I may not but I believe that much I know the scripture we can't be deceived now we can't be deceived to the point of being lost no Satan can't get us far enough to make us lost if we're born again but he can sure attacked all of these senses about us and work on that okay now so you see then it put everybody now watch what I'm getting at if it was the fact that Abel was so perfect as everybody wants to make a - lineage thing I'm getting this point out of the way then we're going the people of the message got a tool in each part they got a lineage it comes down from Adam and if you come from Adam you can be saved if you come from the beast you can't be excited now show me that in the Bible show me that in the prophets message show me that in anywhere come on we proved a point like the people say oh you look at him you look at him big old giant ballplayers now especially them black ones you know big old John one day they throw in that climbing this I probably said well that would have ended it the flood see wait we don't we don't read enough to know that caused it to flood all you had was ham Shem and Japheth and there was you know but now let's start with one point what do you think about mmm salvation the point let me make my point in my statement from this do you believe that because of the fall in the garden that Abel was just as polluted as Cain then we're not talking about big size want them bigger and the other one we're not talking about strong genetic lines of anything you know to come out we're not talking about the beast on one side Adam on the other and well naturally probably Abel would have been a small like God compared to Cain problem once that wound spiritually was polluted it messed up the mind of all mankind and nobody could be brought into the world with eternal life you'd have to come to Jesus Christ right so Abel was just as polluted you've no luck they don't believe you was well then why did able offer a sacrifice case closed drove the stake you dig all day now try big why you're able have to offer a sacrifice he said you just to I know it that's what I am but I'm playing in Blunt and you tell me the difference once the wound is polluted anything that come from the wound was polluted come on what was the curse on you saw a resin things placed upon the woman okay come on but there was no difference in Cain and Abel both of them needed a savior may I ask you a point we'll get to in a minute how did Cain and Abel know that they needed to make an offering they were probably we're just given a number of age we don't worry about it they might have been 20 years of age I could argue the point we had the other day you know and make it real good couldn't because you just go in Genesis and read the accounts and most of them was 150 years old for to have any children read your Bible and let's just kill Cain and Abel 20 25 28 both of them knew they needed to make a sacrifice how do they know that there's no writing in the word that told them they had to do it no riding in the word now you go in a minute we're gonna flop back and you're going to see it was dead center in the middle of the word they knew they had to make an offering and God had said it now listen when we quote brother on him that when he says salvation is based upon the Word of God now don't jump over I know where he says this under the blood tell me where you got to talk to Al for the blood then when we get down to talking about it being the Word of God there's a whole lot more to the Word of God in this Bible that I'm holding this is just a part record of things and it was not written back there so there was no written law telling cain and abel they had to make a right a sacrifice okay maybe we need to think about this as I said we're trying to make a series part that we'll run into it eventually that there's a little difference in the Old Testament the New Testament and you'll find out Lord willing Sunday maybe why I'm stating it like I do I'm very particular in stating salvation not using the word Redemption just using the word salvation so let's start from the very beginning that's the way I do you know that when I start something I started this the shallows I started the most you know point I can get to the least things start with and come up in everybody just so deep deep in what manse in pants and put everybody didn't see him nobody born in any way could have anything that would make any point to save them by and you won't say where this men in ng Jesus didn't need saving so just don't go that far all right let's stop it right to her he didn't need saving he was the Savior what you don't want he's a lot of things he done under the word Mary had to do the same offering for Jesus in the eight days in a circumcision right and she did for the rest of them right I still go too far let's just coast along a little his Paul said descending for Tommy bar with me in my folly you know to the foolishness of preaching try to save the Lost so there's bear with me in the way that I try to bring things all right you say well why did you say this what why didn't you say it I said I don't I don't mean that wrong I made it truthful we look truly Jonah said it in the correct order when Jonah said salvation is of the Lord now watch him he didn't say at that point Redemption he's of the Lord he said salvation all right now so are we settled where we're at we've come up to the point that we've dropped pies to Adam and Eve we're into the whole human race that is lost and needing a Savior don't matter who you are see why then I fight the people this message so much I'll come in the world with eternal life I've always just asked a simple question where was it at and what was it and how did you get it oh it's a seed it's a bit seeds no good without moisture dead as a doornail you know what I mean by the life is laying there but it can't be brought out all right now here's what we're going to be talking about talking about salvation these are the things to consider what is salvation you see we say I'm automatically well it's believing on the Lord Jesus Christ we're over an Old Testament we just remember if the Old Testament is not laid down correctly there is no new the old what is it that was a statement which I'm idea that the old speaks of the new now so the things to consider what is salvation what does it consist off whether it be older New Testament where does it take place the salvation start its journey in you in your body in your spirit or in yourself what are the benefits of salvation and what will salvation provide for mankind remember we're in the Old Testament all right don't jump over and run everything in the new we're in the Old Testament read brother Louisa's awake hey you gonna preach not just coming windy brother Forney don't pray but the next wind in your schedule to pray okay all right you got it okay we got I mean a Tuesday you just make sure you get here on the right date okay yeah we'll try to be here all right but now think about it I love the way the Bible speaks of things and to me you say what you want to to me it says to what it means and means what it says and there's no way to improve on it we try to destroy it but there's no way to improve upon it if God had any other way of doing it then what he done did he done wrong he didn't do it all right so now we're gonna start out talking about what is salvation oh it's a new birth as a senior in the New Testament come back in the Old Testament where we got down we just come with Adam and Eve and we just walk through with that and bringing it and now we've come with Cain and Abel as to standing outside the garden and offering a sacrifice Gudrun said probably right at the gate is where they made their sacrifice called at that time they knew where the gate was ad you know but the angels were there to guard that and I love the way because I remember in the Baptist Church nobody said something about said have you ever thought about how many times it says way other says why wait a minute no wait wait how many times it says way w8y because it starts not off in Genesis they were put there to guard the way of the Tree of Life well not jump SiC 4000 years and here stands a man on earth and he said I am the way I'm the way back in the garden I'm the truth and I'm the life what a wonderful situation so we're over to the point now so we're starting off with a word because I know you wouldn't think this way um and I shouldn't even say it but see we use the word redemption and the redemption is not for everybody right now it's for everybody because guard ladies in their lap and they can receive it but you're not going to receive it but the word salvation is for everybody oh when I heard that prophet I thought how could a man in his mind consider that when he said he said they'll even be a gospel to the heathen in the Millennium you know what that means it either gonna be in the Millennium they're not born again kind of a warning anyone me either how do you need these quotes I'll be glad to get them to it and most of you all know my heart alright but now watch so Jonah he said salvation is of the Lord you denigrate or sermonette of a message describing the situation you were existing in how you was in the whale's belly and you was all around and everything was around you and slopping about and he was floating around in it and in the no whale or we called it the great fish was made and that's fine you know we see we'll argue over that and failed to get the whole point it doesn't matter to me whether it was whale or a fish either way it had to have him out big enough to swallowing right all right let's see we try to get all of that to going but he's laying it down and he's selling how a situation that exists then let me take it as this part okay when man failed from that situation in the garden a wonderful position if you'll read the ten verses I gave you and read them over and over and over you'll see that that's a description of all mankind who fail in the garden you know failed and how death would come why everything would be Jonah was in bad shape he was in terrible shape you know but so you take I love it this way you know I try to do that sometime I love random here being one message and he'll be describing Jonah and he'll be making it so bad until aslam ease but you know of the puke and Obama canned everything is around him and he's in all kind of things and slopping around in all of that that would be in the oils belly and right and then you listen to him in another sermon and he just almost brings it to a place that Jonah was just floating on top of all of that and these nostrils was close to the point he couldn't smell and he was just having a good time and he was just floating around and he had to our condition running and everything was working just right come on listen to the message he's describing sometimes what he's meaning by this sometimes what he's meaning on that okay I won't charge you man just let it go but he comes down and he's coming to the place he says I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of my Thanksgiving then words let my words that my my speech Lord recognize what's taking place and I'll pay the vials at all salvation is over the Lord you know when he finished his message the whale just opened up his mouth and you'll hear brother branham one time saying he vomited him out on the shoulder you hear him the next time maybe saying he rolled his tongue out there and said no a Jonah just walked out of his mouth on the tongue come on read the message but listen to all of the things it's so wonderful to get everything place as he would try to place it in the situation okay now so what does that word salvation mean now remember you're in the Old Testament so don't even start thinking about the thing because hey I know the scripture two hours I got laying on my desk and says there is no salvation outside the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right into the blood of Jesus Christ I mean come on folks we know it but now Jesus Christ wasn't back there and the situation didn't exist back doc alright but let's look at something that's wonderful to think about go ahead brothers brothers yo and pull up number one that word there where it said salvation is of the Lord it's number 34 44 a thirty four four four and it means salvation it means deliver us it means well fire it means to prosperity means deliverance he wanted you to know it meant deliver cleanness Kofi it means salvation by God or means victory now that's the Old Testament definition of salvation so when you narrow it all down to the point of what Jonah is talking about he's talking about the deliverance from the whale's belly right cause as quick as he said salvation is of the Lord now he comes the word deliverance don't forget that well just in case you don't want to go too far where you can say though it changes in the New Testament this don't change too much let's let's go go ahead number two comes the New Testament word is 49 91 that's the word for salvation it means salvation it means the one be saved deliver it means health means saving he's talking about the one side it means deliverance purse what is that / servation preservation safety salvation deliverance from the molestation of enemies in an ethical sense and that's what's included as a sole safety of salvation of the Masai acceleration I get the point one combat the Old Testament is speaking of the word salvation as a deliverance or deliverance you remember o Moses when he was standing at the Red Sea he said stand still what and see the salvation of the Lord now he ain't talking about saving nobody right he's talking about delivers or persevering over the thing he's talking about getting across the Dead Sea so then it's not always to use the word salvation as - meaning like new birth and things like that it starts off with a low form of understanding of salvation and Jonah was the first one used in that form of salvation to the point of saying salvation is of the Lord the others could use salvation that can be used many times we'll get to him at the why if we have time but what I want you to think about all of that back there speaks of right that's the type we're in any time that's just the speaking of it we're in the fulfillment of it all right bringing it out to a point now so let's anchor our thoughts into something that will always be the same no matter whether it's the Old Testament or the New Testament let's bring salvation from a point that we can understand that no matter where it's old or new it has the same meaning to it right pretty good point of salvation right let's read it from the prophet and see what he says about salvation okay go ahead to number three God keeps his word 19:57 III he said having an earth pass away the more she'll never pass away those words were solemnly spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior my subject continuing tonight God keeps his word and it is my belief that the Bible is God's Word and that in the word okay what's you that in the word it gives you a key come on that in the words not another sentence that in the word salvation is based upon the teaching of this Bible okay salvation cannot be based upon any other thing but the Word of God order the Lord many things are good remedies but this is the core love that right God has so planned it that his word is himself okay now so whether it's Old Testament New Testament where are you gonna put it don't matter just remember salvation is based upon the Word of God this is not based on what you think or what I think hold on a minute now don't run off so far with your thoughts and selves based on the blood give me the scripture fart I'll give you the scripture where the Word of God comes into being there because that's what we're doing listen salvation is based no matter where you're at old or new upon the Word of God now listen to a man describe salvation let's read go ahead to number four which is that was paragraph at our e3 from the message God keeps his word this is e for true about ten again so it's the continuing the thought now we cannot base salvation upon prayer as good as it may be we cannot base salvation on prayer now he's not telling you not to pray okay he'll tell you what he talking about the Muhammadans meters praying they prayed three times a day or something like I said the other day they go up to Washington DC they go right out in the middle of the street block the whole thing and pray they don't arrest them but you try you go parts of Christian get down to it and see if anyone arrests you okay they must have more power and we do okay now he describes it as good as it may be he's not saying not to pray don't misunderstand get your silly imaginations and members are not cause look if that be so the Muhammadans are saved we were over in Israel and all at once right in the middle of the day boom and my lord you can't even hardly hear yourself think and they start praying all over Israel on the big microphone and they called him Allah you know who they are they are descendants of Abraham and they're calling me Mahalo Mahalo means God I would see that's what we do but they don't know who they pray to do you we used to pray to the second or third person of the Trinity now you want to argue the stakes drove right we used to talk about a Trinity did we know who we prayed to oh yeah I always know that I prayed to Jesus you pray to Him as a second person of the Trinity third person of the Trinity well no no I just prayed Oh glory the Muhammadans are saved if it's base don't pray the Buddha's are saved the heathens are saved so it cannot be based on prior Oh what's this one and neither can it be based upon experience it's your prophet the way he told it you can't be born again without an experience so now he's not against experience right he's gonna tell you the experience he's talking about read what he says salvation is not based upon experience because people can any kind of an experience no more habitants have experiences the Buddhists have an experience and ever different religion has experiences you've heard run around and tell about the Indian he quote to the Indian thing you know and they would they would get down and they would pray and do rain dances and all like that and he said things happen really supernatural things and he said go into meetings of different thoughts and see a pencil stand up and ride and interpret so listen to what he's talking about the Muhammadans have experiences the Buddhists have experience every different religion has experience and neither can salvation be based upon fasting was against fasting no he done it so they should be based upon fasting pray and experience sensations our sincerity you gonna take your son out and offering like Abraham pretty serious bring it down to more modern today you gonna take your baby out and throw it to an alligator it sincerity many people say well it doesn't make any difference just what I believe as long as I am sincere in what I believe now what was the thought that we started this home when he's saying that salvation is based upon the Word of God and not on anything else now these are the else's that we think it's based on it may not be good language but you know what I'm saying or not well if that be so if it's based on sincerity if it's based on what you believe and come on you can't do whatever you believe in don't get messed up with it come to me and say you don't believe you sound like you don't talk about your prophet it is describing what we should believe and what we should not believe okay well if that be so the Muhammadans will say the Buddha's are say and all the rest of them the heathen is saved when I say that they can outshine us any day like I always say it we talked about we got the truth and the devil's mad at us I remember a pope that got shot just a few years ago for what he believed you ain't been shot yet have you don't play with me on words and philosophies I'm too old I'm sorry let's be serious they can outshine us any day when it comes to prayer fasting sensations and so forth they can outshine us and salvation does not pertain or is not based upon any other thing but the Word of God what God's got to say so so with all the things we might have might not be the word you get the point salvation cannot be based upon any church or any creed nothing but the Word of God British cards worked okay now let's just put it a little bit plainer it's not based on Lula okay church's Lula it's not based on Brenda mites sorry I'm playing you know it so what's the case but I lay down a good case that you're gonna be at that steak trying for a long time try to get up all right now I hope we've made this statement and compacted enough to be able to see what we're talking about that salvation is truly based upon the Bible in salvation of Buddha or Christianity you know shoutings you have praying's you have fastings any religion has some form of a rich world or whatever you want to call it of their church and their things right everybody does you know it's serious they're there they're worshipping I mean you want to be like one of these guys that strap these bombs on the side of him and he's so deceived and he walks out there and he blows his self up and he thinks that's gonna send him to heaven and he's gonna have 70 virgins waiting on him when he gets that her I never did figure out how I got 70 but that's alright don't think I couldn't figure out it what the women got you know but listen how sincere do you think those people are you want to try to give their life for what they believe they work like everything let's go a little bit further go now we've got a tie a knot in the state that we anchor that you won't just go haywire about what I'm saying and what your prophet is trying to bring go to number IC number six one of my place number five now so don't pull it up gonna go to number six what's then salvation coming down to all of the great things and all see salvation is not based upon what somebody someone else things okay is what you think of him can I say it without you getting all breathy puffed about it but it's not based to me upon what brother Branham says I know you didn't understand me the other day when I made that statement no or I might coming and join you later on that's funny I know you you don't listen to what I'm saying I told you my resurrection was not based upon whether brother Branham raised well let that go for that my resurrection is not based on whether Jesus raised two thousand years ago my resurrection is the resurrection that is with inside of me right now because that is all that's going to save me or raise me the believing of the others wonderful which you don't follow me there you think I'm throwing off on something okay sorry it's not based my my salvation my children my wife she has to have her own experience my children my grandchildren my great-grandchildren they have to have their own experience your children not going in because of your experience well then wait a minute we've got our power to get go ahead the Prophet tells you that they're not say just cause of your children they say when you got the same face with them that they come with the same faith you have okay we stop that but look it's not based on what somebody else says it's the based upon what you say yeah we could go a long ways on this right because you know where we could head to if you say to this mountain not if I say look it's not based upon what somebody someone else thinks it's what you think of him divine healing isn't based on what the critics say or what your churches say it's based on what your perfect faith in the inspired Word of God so where is your salvation based about your salvation based on the same thing is the healing which would be based on what the critics have to say about it not the church it's based on your perfect faith in the inspired Word of God it's coming back to an individual of fire it's cause mom and dad egos that don't mean you're going you gotta have your own experience now let's get this and we'll drop back number seven but she serves we would see Jesus I believe that divine healing is based upon a faith just like salvation that we believe that he was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed you notice the Apostle Peter places it in the Pais tense now reads your prophet real careful we were healed he supplies tens just like salvation is a pice tense as the Bible say we were saved before the foundation of the world it's based on a pie stems based on what he done but it's based upon what we can bring it to ourselves as to think within our cell when Jesus died the calorie saved a whole world every human being every would be on earth the same question was settled once for all when Jesus died but it will never it'll never be a beneficiary you will never be a beneficiary of this policy until you accept it and there's nothing you can do to merit it's an unmerited thing that God has done for you and you just accept it by faith in the simplicity of faith God has made it listen so we could all reach it remember cos mister God reveals afterward idiot the bread run said it it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then he goes on to say what and how the Christ could be revealed to the most illiterate person we don't like that do it that's what he said so go ahead in the simplicity of faith God has made it so we could all reach it rich or poor illiterate or educated we can all accept it because it's through it's in the reach of all us just by childlike simplicity to believe that the finished work at Calvary included me how much simpler could it be than that to base everything upon your own simple faith my faith is based upon this idea that wouldn't what is explained it's got to be your own personal experience now Missy so we need to his limitation says quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord Moses standing there he said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord Micah says therefore where I will look unto the Lord I will wait for the God of my salvation my God will hear me I hope it's anchored to understand because this will be our anchor all the way through that no matter what you talking about salvation if it be as Moses stand still and see the salvation the deliverance that's why we're using the word salvation with the word deliverance in other scriptures you read your scriptures and pick up deliverance and see other things delivered from this and deliver the children of Israel was delivered out of Egypt you know the all of the things that happen deals with the word deliverance which can be dealing with the word salvation because it's based upon what a man can believe maybe one of these days you'll realize why the bible says abraham believed god and it was accounted unto him as the word salvation you just go away through the bible day after day of studying in thoughts but we've got another thought we've got a cover now I hope you listened to the start of what we say it to say that salvation and things like that is based upon the Bible now there was hundreds of years and thousands of years they had no Bible and then your prophets come into being and started speaking if you're coming from Genesis to Noah really only have Enoch and Noah it's two prophets others are not mentioned see that it's so strong and so held to that point until Jesus knew what he was gonna have to do when he died he was gonna have to go and preach to the spirits that were in prison listen in the long-suffering in the days of Noah Jesus never went to the Old Testament site and had to preach to him after the prophets began to develop the body but from Genesis to Noah you don't have all of those things you don't have no writings I know I'm read I can read it Jobe is the oldest written I know the part of the story it was written before gender systems I just get the point it's not necessarily stamped letters on a page to call it the Word of God Noah let's see well let's put him first cut he represents the carried over to foolish virgins but Noah's words was God's Word you agree what Noah said to the people was God's words speaking to the people in a man the prior to that time had already got so involved in the Word of God until he walked off the earth we had he built the pyramid what was the pyramid the Bible so we already got the Bible before it ever become letters or anything you got it written in the sky you got it written on the earth by the pyramids and then you had mankind to start bringing it so the words been here a long time what does that word declare and don't come over junk no in the new or anywhere don't even jump over to the law leave all that alone you stay with me we're at cuz come on if you know if I studied it I got it laying there there's no redemption in the law so don't even fool with it which they were salvation while the law was in existence there was grace because the prophets were grace so don't go too far just wait on me let's talk about it now let's get to that little point we were making wanna go how did Cain and Abel know they were made to make a sacrifice and why does it show as we do and talk about it of how dumb Cain was to go to the works of the flesh to try to make an atonement rent Cain went to the works of the flesh he was serving God he was worshipping God he was praying to God but how did Abel know he was to make an atonement we'll get to that in a minute how do you know but how did he know it was to be a blood atonement now remember I made my case laying it down salvation is based upon God's Word God's Word must declare why things are done not written out in pen and ink we declared to be God's Word and what happened I've had ministers argue this and I'm fixing to say what happened when sin entered the picture but random places it he'd had to find it he said when Adam and Eve was walking out of the garden slapping with bloody skins upon their bare legs said then God streamed out and said but I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman when we don't handle seed source he talkin about Jesus Christ as the seed of the woman we know that right see the woman without it which is which is Christ without sex she never had him by sex she had him by creation okay I've preached on this to people and him life and make fun of you to think that God is real enough he could kill an animal and pull the skin off I didn't knock the book he says in Genesis what 3 and 21 under Adam also went to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and covered them do you realize the Adam and Eve was walking out of the garden carrying their atonement it was splattered all over what just relax all over Adam and Eve was a blood sacrifice now we've got the story right it is based upon the Word of God of salvation and the Word of God declared when he said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman declared the coming of the Messiah in God Himself strip the skins off of those animals and atoned for them Abel could look back and said mama what's wrong Cain keeps telling me about all this fruit and all that stuff I said I remember you told me the story then when you were walking out of the garden did God clothed you and Adam with blood that was the first atonement my blood salvation is based upon the blood the word declares where it's based you said well where's that work I'll put in my teens I see the woman God made coach the skin for them see I had to read what the prophet and the people still liked so let's read a few and I'll quit on it go ahead a number 12 now let's see yeah number two well we're getting away over okay do you went anywhere because there was one show thence when sins come and sinner man from the fellowship notice what God did to make man back to fellowship he introduced to the world the blood Redemption right he introduced to the world God did a blood Redemption we're win God killed animals and put their skin showing a blood Redemption and their God after being separated from his from his creatures God laid out the welcome mat back home by the shedding of the blood and that was then and has been and will always be God's provided preparation for fellowship with him is through the shed blood God pulled his skin see that's where I spent months preaching right how real God was well you say God do the people's isn't it Oh God is a spirit he just just be ready gonna run said he wouldn't like the wind and thought he said he was a real being but we don't look back dire as him being something we try to make him come down here but teller he was real back down more real and all this garbage can you could talk about it he was so really pull the skins off no he hired somebody else that's pretty good you know yeah he had one of the height men with the Angels less real he was I've never heard of an angel cuz triple skiing off with an animal no God did so continue on 13 which is fellowship okay God made one preparation for a man to be restored back to that fellowship Onoda nothing else we have tried we've offered to he offered to the human race blood was the way back to fellowship God killed some animals and took their skins she had the innocent blood of the animal and brought it to the brought the skin and wrapped Adam and Eve in it and fellowship with them again fellowship with them again after the shedding of the blood that is God's Way it was God's Way it will always be the right thing to fellowship through the blood reconciliation bring in the believer back into contact with his maker we've tried to educate people to it and they were work we tried to draw the nomination of barriers and say because you go to this church oh yeah outside see signs or anything outside this she had blood of the Lord Jesus Christ will never bring Chappelle Michelle back to the people you already spoke back there the shed blood but it was a shed blood of an animal now you can say what you want to the same quotes brother Branham said God killed the animal and took the skin how do you want this one there he said God killed his own son no man killed Jesus Christ don't get that in your mind that did you done it or there's no no man killed Jesus Christ he said I'll lay my life down he said I can take it come on let's see we don't want to believe God is real okay to go to number 14 we get through in a minute number 14 is having conference yeah and then we find then when God found them standing behind the bush somewhere now there's another quote you won't discipline you know what he said he said Adam and Eve was back in the bush he's having church she was still trying to convince Adam she was right then we find when God found them standing behind the bush somewhere shivering in with the fig leaves aprons on them God luck always the word conferences they always try to go to Geneva sleeping they don't make places and then call the comforts I guess God when he found Adam and he hid behind a bush over there they couldn't come out they said we can't come out father we're naked and who told you you were naked and then they started with the past in the book and all of this I I'm one of the God looked around and he found a tree a certain place a place he thought would be beautiful and he got some skins and threw them back in the bushes and said cover yourself with this and come out before me and they had a conference they talked it over then God made a preparation for them I'll put enmity between that scene to see that one coming well I'm so glad there was an Eden cumference now let us go under not let us go under fig leaves and something we can show up together that God killed something to cover their sins and gave a promise that through the woman's seed would crush the surface he had for telling what he would do okay one more message of grace oh it was terrible that morning darkness hanging in the garden did your son go down what happened it was a terrible that morning darkness hanging in the garden I'll imagine fog of black sack cloth I'd imagine ever leaf never moved there was no wind stirring it was darkness and terrible because sin had blooded out then comes you hold down like a roar of thunder walking through the garden the crying had him or aren't now that's when I don't realize he was naked and it's sin before God he hid himself and tried to make himself a religion but it didn't work God kills her she took the skins and showed that something had to die to cover sin joining church will never cover sin no dried out confession will never cover scene it takes sour and repentance and the grace of God to cover sin or the blood of Jesus Christ the one that God killed at Calvary to cover see him what about it Church come on brothers what about it there is no salvation without the Bible the Bible declares the blood atonement and that would be the only way that God would ever fellowship with mankind was through the blood they had their deliverance and listen you're not paying close attention what's your prophet said when he said them games he turned around and that fellowship with him it was restored right there no he was mad he thought him a leader tell us it was restored they come my children you're gonna have trouble you're gonna have problems but you know what I love I love the day the Prophet said said look he said God didn't curse at him he said God didn't curse Eve he said God cursed to earth the beast in the Sun but he didn't curse Adam and Eve how could he curse them when they were standing with animal skin covered in blood are you listening how could he condemn them when they were standing there with the shed blood the atonement made that's why Cain and Abel they had to make an atonement they found that out Abel he said it had to be blood see because I'd born in my mama's blood from my daddy's blood it's gotta be blood did they offer that back Baron said the story's been told me that God killed those animals said I'm going to offer that blood you know what that was that was his salvation the blood atonement to Adam and Eve was their salvation their deliverance I'll tell you one thing that we are eventually going to in the message was the lifestyle that we asked what would your salvation bring to you it brought Adam and Eve you brought Abel you brought all of those just ones down through there a place called Paradise that they could die and not be annihilated I love it when it says over in the New Testament about the parable of the rich you learn you know the man said it was in the bosom of Abraham Buddhism means that there's not just a belly but it actually is a place or carrying mechanism not in front of you I thought we believed that we were the seed of Abraham by faith it provided for them provided for us what we got that's damn take on these themes start a little simple thought of salvation I come to the car well the deal is still on the road if I have a need you already saying that going down to the garden he gets back home soon or don't matter how good you do things it's from the heart remember now with me is faith in the blood [Music] so it's yours not everybody else's if you're a doctor [Music] as we Ted [Music] you might have an $8 open [Music] it is so sweet [Music] well my car you got burned in fire then it's fine [Music] and sweet [Music] father we thank you for the night we pray that you stand with me worthy the best and we Lord look all the way back it's what we got to believe you got to believe you Lord and what you say you got to believe that you made an atomic force to the blood Lord that would speak all the way down always be the blood but the main thing is believe in you that that blood was applied for me thank you Lord in Jesus you dismiss and with the services Sunday pray one for another
