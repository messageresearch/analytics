[3:36] to that understanding forgive our sins
[3:39] and lead us by thy grace in Jesus name
[3:42] Amen
[3:47] visions 2 and 8 for by grace are you
[3:51] saved through faith
[3:53] and that not of yourselves it is the
[3:55] gift of God and I remember it's a China
[3:57] travel journey that is our whole point
[4:00] of what we've been talking about is the
[4:04] journey of a Christian alright now let's
[4:07] go to Ezekiel 36 we started reading
[4:11] about verse 24 for I will take you from
[4:17] among the heathen and gather you out of
[4:19] all the country and will bring you unto
[4:22] your own land remember what this is this
[4:25] is back
[4:26] this is Ezekiel speaking of the coming
[4:29] of the Jews to the homeland all right to
[4:33] their their land says then when I
[4:36] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[4:39] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[4:41] and from all your idols
[4:43] while I cleanse you so he's gonna do a
[4:46] great cleansing for the children of
[4:49] Israel now how is that to be done now he
[4:53] describes the way it's to be done verse
[4:57] 26 a new heart also when I give you and
[5:01] a new spirit when I put put within you
[5:04] and I will take away the stony heart out
[5:07] of your flesh and I will give you a
[5:09] heart of flesh and I will put my spirit
[5:12] within you and cause you to walk in my
[5:15] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[5:17] and do them and you shall dwell in the
[5:21] land that I have given you shall be my
[5:24] people and I will be your God you may be
[5:27] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[5:29] reading of the word now I'm hoping
[5:32] tonight that we can get to the point but
[5:36] I I learned a long time ago when you get
[5:40] in a hurry and you stumble and fall you
[5:45] know so we just move slow and just take
[5:50] our time all right yeah what have we
[5:54] been talking about now we've been
[5:58] reading this from Ezekiel about three
[6:00] messages talking about the plan of
[6:03] salvation and if that wonderful
[6:06] that here in the Old Testament is a a
[6:11] handwritten I mean writing down of
[6:14] exactly how the plan of salvation works
[6:20] then that's something that it's the plan
[6:23] of salvation that I'll give you a new
[6:26] heart I'll give you a new spirit and
[6:31] then I put my spirit in you now what
[6:34] about that to put that in the Old
[6:36] Testament in that form of of doing to
[6:41] put it in actually in just a few verses
[6:45] you know and actually in the New
[6:49] Testament all the others you don't have
[6:51] that much you can get my point
[6:53] I believe Ezekiel describes a complete
[6:56] plan of redemption new heart new spirit
[6:59] my spirit within you all right see then
[7:02] you don't have that in any of the other
[7:04] scriptures even the New Testament
[7:05] doesn't have enough to show you it'll
[7:08] talk to you about justification
[7:09] it'll talk about sanctification and talk
[7:12] about those things the baptism of the
[7:14] Holy Ghost
[7:15] well what about Ezekiel putting that to
[7:17] the point of expressing what would take
[7:20] place I'll put you in your land I'll
[7:23] sprinkle you with clean water which is
[7:25] washing of the water by the word then
[7:29] I'll give you a new heart promising the
[7:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the
[7:33] children of Israel and I'll give you a
[7:36] new heart he's he's describing the way
[7:39] to come to salvation now I want to make
[7:43] sure you understand one point that I've
[7:46] been driving heavily I've watched it and
[7:48] my wife and I were talking about it
[7:49] today
[7:50] I've listened three times to the past
[7:53] message I try to listen to make sure to
[7:57] try to get to a point of worth it you
[8:00] know that you can understand what I'm
[8:03] saying and then if I see if there's any
[8:06] statements that are made incorrect or
[8:08] anything I try to correct them but I
[8:11] want you to think about the plan of
[8:13] salvation okay now we are a human being
[8:18] which is a body
[8:20] spirit and soul all right it takes those
[8:24] three to make the human being all right
[8:27] now when it comes to this part here of
[8:29] Ezekiel I'll give you a new heart a new
[8:32] spirit with my spirit II don't confuse
[8:35] the point because when he said I'll give
[8:38] you a new spirit that is not talking
[8:41] about a new second rim of the where you
[8:46] would say body spirit and soul Nancy
[8:49] because how would he give you a new
[8:51] memory a new conscience a new affections
[8:54] and you could do on certain things but a
[8:56] lot of that won't work so don't get that
[8:58] confused just make it to be what it is
[9:02] all right he's describing the plan of
[9:05] salvation and he says now I'll give you
[9:08] a new heart now that doesn't mean he's
[9:13] gonna give you another one the word new
[9:16] there does not necessarily mean that
[9:18] because remember Jesus is the beginning
[9:20] of the creation of God and that's a new
[9:23] creation but that's not a different one
[9:26] he's part of this creation so just don't
[9:30] take it because it will say a new heart
[9:32] and a new spirit whatever he's gonna
[9:34] give me a new heart no he's not gonna
[9:37] take out your heart then if you
[9:40] translate it and can get another to
[9:42] understand heart and soul is the same
[9:44] word all right so then you don't want to
[9:48] say what he's gonna take my heart or
[9:50] take out my soul and give me another one
[9:52] no he's going to work on what he's got
[9:54] because that would not be redemption if
[9:58] you take away and throw it away that's
[10:00] not Redemption all right so if he's
[10:03] going to redeem you he's gonna have to
[10:06] start working on you from the inward
[10:09] part and remember that what we've
[10:11] brought out then salvation is not
[10:14] working as much in the realm of of the
[10:18] body and spirit it works in the soul of
[10:22] mankind the body and spirit are just old
[10:26] elements it goes with it
[10:27] so I didn't want you to get confused
[10:29] when we keep reading our
[10:31] saying new spirit Bertrand explains what
[10:35] that is I'm gonna but I thought well
[10:38] people don't hear a lot of times what
[10:39] you say so I need to emphasize that
[10:42] don't get tied up then to think we'll
[10:45] that new spirit that's a new memory new
[10:47] conscience new affection that's a new
[10:49] second realm of you know cuz your your
[10:53] body experience and so what you're gonna
[10:55] give your knees for it don't don't get
[10:56] tax hide that away it's not that that's
[10:58] not what he's talking about
[11:00] it's a new spirit it's exactly what he
[11:02] says you couldn't live with your own
[11:04] self
[11:05] and remember what the Prophet said he
[11:10] said he'll give you a new heart write
[11:14] what you sow mm-hmm that's it not
[11:19] another one gonna make that new he's
[11:22] gonna take that soul and mellow it down
[11:24] so do you remember so I'm trying to
[11:27] relate things to where you can remember
[11:29] your experience right do you remember
[11:34] when you first came to the Lord you know
[11:37] but I've been young might have been Oh
[11:38] what at that but do you remember you
[11:41] went to the altar with a load of sin you
[11:44] know ever what you went and you poured
[11:47] out your heart to God and asking him to
[11:49] forgive you to save you and you come
[11:52] forth with a a great feeling you you
[11:56] know Europe lifted and and everything
[12:00] will see just remember it that's not
[12:03] taking out your spirit as the memory
[12:06] reason conscience and a factions and
[12:08] things that's not working on that it's
[12:11] working on he's gonna give you a new
[12:14] soul not another one he's gonna clean
[12:18] that out you remember how we had to draw
[12:22] enough then we took the drawing from the
[12:26] future home and we wound up leaving it
[12:28] pure nothing in there all right that's
[12:32] what happens to the individual when that
[12:35] individual is justified and sanctified
[12:38] all right his soul is clean not his body
[12:43] not his memory
[12:45] his reasoning it'd be nice it would
[12:48] really be nice to do away with all of my
[12:51] memory
[12:52] wouldn't you there's a lot in my memory
[12:56] I would love to a rice you know it
[13:00] wouldn't bother me to go
[13:01] you know it's what to try to do that
[13:02] shock treatment you know electrical
[13:04] shock is they try to knock your memory
[13:07] jolt it out and then when it comes back
[13:08] you forgets a lot of well I probably pay
[13:11] for that if I can you I'd come out of it
[13:13] with better thinking but I'm still
[13:16] thinking the same old way I'm was and
[13:18] that's why brother Brandon will say he
[13:20] said uh it didn't take out my desire to
[13:23] hunt well but your father and Lin have
[13:27] that we drape made to drawing and it was
[13:29] pretty and white that's the person who
[13:33] has been justified and sanctified the
[13:38] unclean spirits gone out all right now
[13:41] what happens IRA you remember what I
[13:42] asked it I said if that's pure and clean
[13:45] that's you now the snake is gone that
[13:50] was part of your perversion sin is gone
[13:53] right
[13:55] then you come forth with a new spirit
[13:57] were the Prophet said he gives you a new
[14:01] heart
[14:01] I keep quoted like that because when you
[14:05] read the book and you get it with soul
[14:06] or something you said well that even
[14:08] what he say it see that's how carnal a
[14:10] lot of people are they won't listen to
[14:13] what you're saying then make you say
[14:15] what they want you to say it gives you a
[14:18] new soul not destroying that cleaning it
[14:22] up making it mellow making it repentant
[14:25] making it in love with God wanting to do
[14:29] what's right repent it sometime all
[14:31] right and he said then he gives you a
[14:33] new spirit well that's not a new memory
[14:37] reason consciousness no it gives you a
[14:39] new spirit where does he put the new
[14:41] spirit where the run said he puts it
[14:43] right in the heart you know I got one
[14:46] here where he said he puts that new
[14:48] heart right in the center of the old man
[14:52] so that's showing your words add to soul
[14:56] now and then see that huge
[14:59] goes right in that new soul right in
[15:02] your soul all right and you're still not
[15:05] right now you thinking it's changed your
[15:10] desires has changed a lot you know but
[15:13] it's still not complete because he said
[15:16] then I put my spirit in you
[15:20] he said now there's the Holy Spirit
[15:23] now here's what I was talking to my wife
[15:25] today but and I don't mean this to hurt
[15:27] feelings I mean it to try to help you to
[15:29] understand you know justification st.
[15:31] case the baptism when the Holy Ghost was
[15:33] the Pentecostal message come on that was
[15:42] might not have been exactly Azusa Street
[15:45] as much but by the time that come over
[15:47] to about 19 and 11 or in there then you
[15:51] started your oneness and you started
[15:54] your daddy C morning with the one that's
[15:56] coming forth and surely they would have
[15:59] believed in three stages of grace that's
[16:03] what was the Pentecostal idea well what
[16:06] about your prophet trying to tell him
[16:08] what happened and he said but yes had
[16:12] you missed it he said cuz most people
[16:17] believe when you give that new spirit
[16:20] they believe that's the Holy Spirit he
[16:22] said that's not right he said that's a
[16:26] new spirit he said you couldn't
[16:29] understand your own self it gives you a
[16:33] new desire a new thoughts like I said
[16:36] you come to the altar and you ask God to
[16:38] forgive you remember that you ask God to
[16:42] forgive you you come forth with this
[16:44] peace in mind and you're feeling good
[16:47] you're living different you act
[16:48] different but that can be the full new
[16:53] birth but also it can be that new spirit
[16:59] comes here regardless of whether it's
[17:02] two minutes or two years you're going to
[17:04] go through a new heart a new spirit and
[17:10] put God's Spirit in you
[17:12] or you don't have the new birth right
[17:17] now remember that was the Pentecostal
[17:20] message do you think they understood it
[17:27] but rather said they didn't he said
[17:32] especially the Pentecostal he said they
[17:34] think that new spirit is the Holy Spirit
[17:37] well what about a prophet now here's a
[17:40] group of people the Pentecostals with a
[17:44] message of three stages of grace right
[17:50] that's what they taught that's what they
[17:52] believed well here comes a prophet have
[17:56] you straighten that out and I'm sure
[17:59] there was a lot of those Pentecostal
[18:01] priests incorrectly we're not going off
[18:03] on anything I'm sure they preached it
[18:06] correctly some of you may be come down
[18:08] through there some listen in you maybe
[18:11] remember those days when you know that
[18:14] things was being taught back there but
[18:18] it's like I said to you before when
[18:23] brother Branham had those 300 Ministers
[18:28] they take challenge them on his doctrine
[18:31] of water baptism now I've asked you to
[18:35] go and check but I think you oughta have
[18:37] enough sense to know then wouldn't
[18:39] Baptists and Methodists now they may
[18:42] have been a few sprung in but then we're
[18:45] Pentecostal people and a lot of the
[18:48] Pentecostal people the black people
[18:51] especially of Haywood in them and
[18:52] already baptizing in the name of the
[18:55] Lord Jesus Christ before brother Branham
[18:58] ever come on the same especially Jesus
[19:03] name because they went in the water
[19:04] baptism unto regeneration
[19:07] what was the after him about why didn't
[19:12] they agree with him if they believed in
[19:15] father
[19:15] I mean the Lord Jesus Christ our Jesus
[19:19] Christ well because he was against them
[19:23] preaching under regeneration
[19:26] and they flare up about that data they
[19:29] were preaching regeneration that's what
[19:39] I mean - we think we understand the
[19:42] prophets message when I'm trying to make
[19:44] a simple illustration if you listen that
[19:47] there was the people with a message of
[19:49] three stages of grace that was the
[19:54] Pentecostal message right
[20:00] you think they understood what he tried
[20:02] to explain if he did why did he try to
[20:05] explain it right why did he tie the line
[20:11] why are a lot of Christian people you
[20:14] know can't understand anything people
[20:17] misunderstand and say that new spirit
[20:22] they could handle that new heart
[20:24] I remember the Baptist Church when they
[20:26] taught her new heart come on I remember
[20:32] that in the Baptist Church when they
[20:34] talked about a new a new heart that it
[20:36] doesn't mean to take your heart out put
[20:38] a nun in it means to mellow it down it
[20:40] means to change the nature of it they're
[20:43] making it something that's probable that
[20:46] can be used well surely you're
[20:49] Pentecostal or know God but why was that
[20:52] they miss that new spirit because you
[20:58] know yourself what they done they wanted
[21:01] to give the tongues and speaking the
[21:04] things and they didn't care what the
[21:06] word said right come on what about it
[21:14] what about it of what with is yeah what
[21:21] about a new heart a heart of flesh so
[21:27] you were received in a new spirit in
[21:29] that heart and then I'll put my spirit
[21:32] in that the new heart new spirit and my
[21:38] spirit three things
[21:42] but do we believe that and like I've
[21:47] told you now I'm as plain as I can be if
[21:48] I'm wrong you tell me I'll be glad to
[21:51] come back here and tell you tell who
[21:52] told us wrong until what you say is
[21:55] wrong
[21:56] but listen Church if we don't get this
[22:03] right of understanding from reading what
[22:06] a prophet would say how could we get it
[22:09] from anything else I mean we've got his
[22:16] very words to express I'll give you a
[22:21] new heart and he said he said and that's
[22:23] not the Holy Spirit he said you couldn't
[22:28] even agree with your own self well now
[22:32] think about the growing autumn talking
[22:34] about there's the heart it's clean he
[22:37] gives you a new spirit it's clean right
[22:41] because God can't give you a wrong
[22:43] spirit they give you a new spirit is
[22:47] clean
[22:47] all right if you don't do something
[22:50] about it that unclean spirit will come
[22:51] back and what does it come with
[22:56] religious demons right all right see
[23:03] then looking at it and seeing it in the
[23:05] correct way then we ought to know where
[23:10] we're standing
[23:13] he never said I'll just polish up the
[23:16] old spirit polish up the old heart but
[23:21] I'll give you a new heart and a new
[23:23] spirit now that sounds this exactly like
[23:25] it's gonna take it out put another one
[23:27] in I got quotes for brother Brown saying
[23:31] they don't give you a new heart now he
[23:33] gave me a brand new heart
[23:35] what if doctors they tell you my heart's
[23:37] brand-new where they gonna tell you when
[23:40] it quits that's silly
[23:44] this is what I'm trying to be I try to
[23:48] preach straight and try to hold it to a
[23:50] line but dinner I get to that point to
[23:52] know it and realize
[23:53] what with human beings think about he
[23:57] said you get a new spirit
[24:00] you quit your drinking you get a new
[24:03] spirits you quit you're drinking light
[24:05] you get a new spirit and you can do most
[24:08] anything with that spirit but that isn't
[24:12] what God's talking about a new spirit he
[24:16] said I'll give you know I'll give you a
[24:18] new heart a new spirit why he didn't
[24:21] have to give you a new spirit excuse me
[24:24] one he that he'd have to give you a new
[24:27] spirit to live for him well you couldn't
[24:30] even live with yourself how do you
[24:33] remember I gave you one I'll find it
[24:35] here in a few minutes
[24:36] or did it verifies what brother ran and
[24:39] say it he said you accepted God but said
[24:44] has God accepted you right on one of
[24:49] these quotes that's what he's describing
[24:53] that's why he said you can't get the
[24:56] Spirit of God why they've got it here
[25:01] someone I'm not finding in a minute but
[25:03] that's all he said you can't get the
[25:06] spirit of god in other words why if you
[25:09] don't get the Holy Spirit why is it that
[25:11] the fact if you accept him how come he
[25:14] don't accept you come on did the Prophet
[25:18] say that yes because you don't approach
[25:24] him correctly you approach him to the
[25:30] point of trying to get a new heart and
[25:32] then when you do you get a new spirit
[25:34] and oh you're happy your choice your you
[25:37] love in this way never and you think
[25:39] that's the Holy Spirit and you won't
[25:41] think anymore
[25:51] I'm trying my best this is the one gold
[25:54] and I've done and I wish I told my wife
[25:56] today what I wish I hadn't done it I
[25:58] wish I'd have had you to write down your
[26:00] experience on a piece of paper and hold
[26:03] it in front of you wanna preach because
[26:05] I'm trying my best to get you to see
[26:08] that you've been through a lot of these
[26:10] things you've been through a lot of
[26:14] these experiences these happenings in
[26:18] your life as you come to the altar you
[26:21] cried out before God you come to altar
[26:24] you weeping you get up feeling so happy
[26:26] so wonderful like a load of sin is gonna
[26:30] and you're so great and good and you
[26:32] start going to church and you start
[26:34] doing things and you become a very you
[26:37] know religious person well if that's the
[26:43] Holy Spirit as the new birth wonderful
[26:46] but what if it's just that new spirit
[26:52] well how do you know the difference each
[26:57] one of them is a spirit he's one of them
[27:00] is the spirit from God and the spirit he
[27:02] gives you as a new spirit is not a
[27:04] vulgar spirit to make you thanking
[27:06] acting do wrong it's a good spirit to
[27:08] make you think an act to do right how
[27:11] are you gonna tell the difference
[27:12] between it in the Holy Spirit the only
[27:21] way I can put my experience whatsoever
[27:23] and hold in the right way is to realize
[27:26] from the day God came into me and I you
[27:31] heard my story that's two years in this
[27:33] message before I'd ever say I had
[27:35] baptism in the Holy Ghost I didn't jump
[27:38] into the message and say I believe the
[27:40] Prophet so I know I got it brother
[27:42] so-and-so said I had it I didn't until
[27:49] it was something settled within me from
[27:52] that day in that altar when I raised up
[27:54] from there to this day there's one thing
[27:56] settled
[28:02] this is right this is God's Word and the
[28:09] Prophet is an explainer our diviner or
[28:13] whatever you gonna call it of that word
[28:18] so why can't we just keep reading that's
[28:20] what I asked you to do I said go home
[28:23] take your computer just running it stony
[28:26] heart running that new heart a new
[28:28] spirit you know and find out how many
[28:30] times brother run said this and read
[28:32] each one of them we shouldn't need but
[28:36] one but I give you at least two or three
[28:42] for you to understand a new heart he
[28:51] mellows that heart down he takes that
[28:54] soul of that individual it agin z' to
[28:56] work on it he's not working on your body
[28:58] he's not working on your spirit to try
[29:00] to get it lined up that's what we think
[29:02] we think well I'm doing good I got it
[29:04] lined up I done and run all week oh man
[29:11] you don't like me to quote brother
[29:13] branham do hear what he say brother
[29:16] branham do you see and he said everyday
[29:19] now there's that throw it off of him no
[29:27] i'm bragging on him cuz minds about
[29:29] three times a day but now listen so i
[29:36] give you a new heart and a new spirit
[29:39] then i put my spirit within you the holy
[29:46] spirit all right now we're to that third
[29:50] stage our phase of you new birth which
[29:57] of the phase or the part of talking
[29:59] about something happening now that his
[30:02] new that he'll put in you his spirit the
[30:07] Holy Spirit the Prophet said it right we
[30:12] read them you need them I got him lay
[30:14] here he gives you the new birth in the
[30:19] soul that don't change your body it
[30:23] don't change your natural human spirit
[30:26] of the memory reason conscience
[30:28] affection it begins to work upon those
[30:32] places and working from the inside out
[30:36] because what he put inside of you a
[30:44] mellow soul a soft mellow so he puts
[30:54] within that soul a new spirit then when
[31:02] he gives you the new birth he puts his
[31:05] spirit within you right that makes the
[31:10] new world
[31:11] darzee three stages same its
[31:13] justification sanctification baptism of
[31:17] the holy spirit now if you've been
[31:20] studying on the future home we're
[31:23] capable now of going into the future
[31:26] home to talk about this third stage the
[31:29] third third stage which is the baptism
[31:32] of the holy ghost and you know what I
[31:36] like about what the Bible says I indeed
[31:41] baptize you with water unto repentance
[31:45] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[31:49] than I whose shoes I am not worthy to
[31:52] borrow he said baptize you with the Holy
[31:56] Ghost and with fire and that's Scripture
[32:04] that was in Matthews or 1 in Luke saying
[32:07] basically the same wording as I'll
[32:12] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[32:16] fire why does it say and with fire does
[32:21] that mean that there's three stages
[32:24] one's the baptism and then two of the
[32:26] two fires or something
[32:27] what does it mean that was what the
[32:35] problem was I'm gonna saying it plain
[32:38] language that can be that you people cuz
[32:40] I remember back there thinking about
[32:43] these things and us talking about it
[32:45] that a Holy Ghost and fire and I talk to
[32:47] Pentecostal people about that
[32:49] and I said what does that mean Holy
[32:51] Ghost and with fire well that's that's -
[32:53] it - baptisms young that's a baptism and
[32:57] then the other when you come for speed
[32:59] in tongues one would explain you know
[33:03] but what does it say it like that and
[33:09] now I say it this way the Bible always
[33:13] says what it means and means what it
[33:17] says no let's forget anything else well
[33:22] maybe they just mistranslated there well
[33:25] maybe we need to go to you to find out
[33:27] what's right and wrong about it you know
[33:32] you don't not be that way brother sale
[33:34] well if you in correcting the word I'm
[33:37] supposed to kiss your toe so what I've
[33:40] always said if you can correct brother
[33:41] branham pull your shoe off I'm supposed
[33:44] to worship the one that could do those
[33:46] things
[33:49] see I know you can't do it but I know
[33:54] the word is always right what is this
[33:59] say with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:01] are the Holy Ghost you'll come down with
[34:05] fire and do what it says the baptism of
[34:11] the Holy Ghost and with fire I'm like
[34:18] this that I was talking to one man one
[34:20] time and I told him something but I run
[34:22] say it and he said I don't know where he
[34:25] said that or not
[34:25] I said I'm telling you what he said
[34:30] well I don't know what he said I said
[34:34] we'll give me counting to go look it up
[34:35] well he didn't won't do that
[34:39] he said what are you talking like I
[34:40] define I'm talking like this if you
[34:44] don't know the Bible says the baptism of
[34:46] the Holy Ghost and with fire we can pull
[34:48] it up here Joe it go that's what it does
[34:51] but why what and your prophet says it
[35:04] next comes the baptism of the fire and
[35:08] Holy Ghost that guard might dwell in us
[35:13] and the only way he can dwell in us is
[35:17] for something to happen after you're
[35:20] sanctified there was a doctor among your
[35:24] denomination called the entire
[35:25] sanctification but run said that's wrong
[35:30] did the message disbelief sanctification
[35:33] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[35:37] could say right for the ages would they
[35:39] believe the baptism that wasn't enough
[35:42] to bring it to the complete baptism it
[35:47] was the work of the Holy Spirit
[35:48] what's your prophet said but it wasn't
[35:53] enough to call it the baptism but Luther
[35:57] I mean Wesley called it's a new birth
[35:58] and that's what it was you remember the
[36:02] other day and the messages are trying to
[36:04] bring Luther had three words I mean
[36:06] three stages Wesley had three stages
[36:09] Pentecostals had three stages anybody's
[36:12] ever born again I'm quoting your prophet
[36:14] they said there they have to have the
[36:16] three stages he said absolutely if not
[36:21] you're not born again now you saw what I
[36:24] don't blues rad code I know people are
[36:26] drunk and I've done myself I just had
[36:28] one go ahead
[36:36] listen what's your profit centers of the
[36:39] message the future home go ahead with
[36:43] number three I'll pick these up
[36:50] then secondly comes sanctification he
[36:52] just got through explaining yours a
[36:54] human heart and here's a human heart and
[36:56] fight and only just got to explaining
[36:58] that then he goes down to paragraph 91
[37:01] stop it there the insecticons
[37:03] sanctification which sets their mind in
[37:05] order for holiness the thing right taken
[37:07] away sanctification is a compound Greek
[37:10] word which means cleaned and set aside
[37:13] for service then the next comes the
[37:15] baptism of the fire and the Holy Ghost
[37:19] that God might dwell in us listen and
[37:23] the fire of God cleanses our heart from
[37:29] sin and puts the Holy Ghost inside then
[37:35] you bring forth the same life that this
[37:37] did because that's in us now listen
[37:44] sanctification the unclean spirits gone
[37:46] out which you remember the drawing clear
[37:49] light you remember the message you
[37:52] remember what we've been talking today a
[37:53] new spirit all of that but why does it
[37:58] put there because that's you then you
[38:03] know what's wrong with me in you we lean
[38:10] to that whole spirit what you see what
[38:17] I'm talking about is you don't take the
[38:18] draw and pull it up and it's clean what
[38:21] happened what's that you're the same
[38:23] person take my case I believe I walked
[38:28] in a sanctified state in the Baptist
[38:29] Church after I found out what it really
[38:31] was but I know what God done so I don't
[38:35] worry about huh
[38:38] but you see I didn't receive the baptism
[38:40] with all ago still two years in this
[38:41] message all right now who was I and what
[38:47] was I and what kind of shape was I in to
[38:53] the world I was in the good shape
[38:55] because that's what they looked at to
[38:57] the church I was in I was made a deacon
[39:00] at 23 years old
[39:06] they thought the world of me that way
[39:09] they didn't run me out of the church I
[39:13] left because I knew the doctrine of that
[39:16] church and where I was wrong I knew when
[39:19] I got baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[39:21] Christ
[39:21] no Baptist Church would accept that and
[39:24] if I left and come back I was going to
[39:27] be rebaptised that's the doctrine of the
[39:30] Baptist Church so he wouldn't that they
[39:35] didn't run me out I walk out of my own
[39:39] but what was I say the two years from
[39:43] the sanctification to receiving the
[39:45] baptism I was me I was a religious
[39:49] person I went to church we never had any
[39:52] arguments from the day my wife and I
[39:54] married we never had an argument over
[39:56] whether was going to church what was
[39:58] gonna do there was never a discussion we
[40:02] went to church
[40:04] we've always went in there more and you
[40:06] know yourself you've been around you
[40:08] long enough to know when we go on any
[40:10] work that we're not here we're in church
[40:14] because that's just part of me you said
[40:18] well I'm dead well that's all right I'm
[40:20] not D Christianizing you I'm just
[40:23] telling you what to do better okay
[40:28] they come out pretty good I guess but
[40:31] listen do you understand what I'm
[40:35] getting at you're standing there washed
[40:37] and clean you have a new spirit you love
[40:41] the Lord you want to do what's right but
[40:45] yet you don't have the new birth you
[40:48] don't have the death well what are you
[40:52] you're a religious person wonderful good
[40:57] person maybe all of that but that's
[41:00] where you can slip backwards and forward
[41:02] then remember that and that's where the
[41:04] northern ones can come in we've tried to
[41:06] cover all of that all right let's see if
[41:13] why do I have to have a fire
[41:20] why do I need that fire because listen
[41:24] you ain't gonna like it
[41:26] but listen because what I was was a
[41:31] religious person I'll talk about myself
[41:35] I loved the Lord I went to church that's
[41:40] all I ever done was just prayed and what
[41:43] I was welcomed all over the Baptist
[41:46] Association and all like that I can go
[41:48] and fellowship with him I tried to do
[41:54] what was right I didn't have to quit
[41:58] drinking God it didn't drink well then
[42:03] think you better not maybe the one fact
[42:05] I've tried to explain it to you I was
[42:07] born a poor boy I couldn't afford a
[42:08] liquor bottle you can take what you want
[42:11] to about what you're thinking
[42:12] that's his God's honest truth I couldn't
[42:15] afford to smoke and I was not gonna let
[42:18] that be a part of him cause in the
[42:20] Baptist I didn't let it be a part of me
[42:25] understand four years living in a place
[42:29] to where you couldn't light a finger on
[42:33] my life until I working with a lady one
[42:38] day and she said something and I said
[42:40] well that's a hot rod I said all of us
[42:43] have our problems she said Sam I've been
[42:45] here a couple of years with you and said
[42:47] you ain't never had a problem well that
[42:50] meant something to me at least I had
[42:53] done something to portray Christ a
[42:55] little bit no they understand what I'm
[42:59] saying from the time I was sanctified
[43:01] you're getting that baptism in the Holy
[43:03] Ghost
[43:04] that wasn't me I was in me with that new
[43:10] spirit they wanted to go to church and
[43:13] want to do what's right want to quit
[43:15] what I needed to quit and do what I
[43:17] needed to do how about you did you ever
[43:21] live in all that
[43:25] but you understand what was wrong I did
[43:29] not have eternal life in my soul I did
[43:34] not have that new birth that I needed
[43:41] so there's a lot got to be burnt out so
[43:44] for the next 30 minutes now remember one
[43:47] time we're talking about Holy Ghost and
[43:51] with fire has to be the fact that when
[43:54] you're justified that's wonderful that
[43:57] cleaned that sin when you're sanctified
[43:59] that unclean spirit goes out and you're
[44:02] walking in a great place of a new spirit
[44:04] and all kind of thing happening but
[44:06] you're still not eternal when the Holy
[44:10] Ghost came then he can't go in there why
[44:15] cause you still you you ain't good
[44:19] you're still alive you're still living
[44:23] and who you're living for I just had
[44:28] willpower you know yourself what I'm
[44:32] talking about
[44:33] most people went back into the world
[44:35] they come to church they've repented
[44:37] they go back into the world and they
[44:39] smoke they drank there and they never
[44:41] come really when they don't make no
[44:42] difference
[44:42] like I told Wade sin we don't have the
[44:45] messages or they don't care anyway you
[44:48] know well this was a Methodist preacher
[44:50] you know but listen there was too much
[44:57] of me still alive and that's what I'm
[45:00] asking you to go now to the message of
[45:04] the future home and start right back
[45:08] over reading where that unclean spirit
[45:10] goes out and it comes down I've got it
[45:12] right here where it comes out you know
[45:15] and then sanctification and then the
[45:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire
[45:22] because you see the Holy Ghost can't
[45:24] come in until everything is burnt out
[45:28] and therefore your fire comes in that's
[45:32] why it's right when it says Holy Ghost
[45:34] and with fire fire precedes the Holy
[45:40] Ghost to burn out anything that's left
[45:42] of you that's why most people never get
[45:49] to Newburgh they won't come to that
[45:51] place they won't die out enough to let
[45:53] it burn out cause they think they got it
[45:57] they shout their speaking does it prove
[46:00] or they say they cry they do it I think
[46:02] they've got it but listen to what he's
[46:04] saying
[46:06] go ahead paragraph 91 it was on then the
[46:12] next comes a baptism of the fire and
[46:14] Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us
[46:17] and the fire of God cleanses our hearts
[46:21] from sin well now if it cleanses our
[46:24] floors anything much miss what's in
[46:25] there that's sensible right they must
[46:30] mean there's something wrong no sin and
[46:33] puts the Holy Ghost inside not just an
[46:37] anointing thing and we bring forth the
[46:40] same life that this did all right roll
[46:46] it on up a little
[46:47] now there's sanctification the third
[46:50] second stage of it cleanses the mind
[46:52] sets or not sets the heart the mind of
[46:57] the heart and order of holiness you
[46:59] don't repent is he coming then he's
[47:02] baptized okay but then when he gets
[47:06] sanctified that cleanses that desire out
[47:09] of him now some people think that that
[47:12] sanctification is what burns you out it
[47:20] burns out what you don't need yeah cause
[47:23] this part of your life is you don't need
[47:24] yes I repenting it goes out at
[47:26] sanctification took it out yeah but it's
[47:30] not the burning come on I'm trying to
[47:35] give you see something Kagari
[47:37] coming into an unclean vessel
[47:39] if there's any sin left in our vessel
[47:43] God will not come in now you can claim
[47:47] all you want to and think you've done
[47:49] everything you want to but just remember
[47:52] that statement if that Holy Ghost comes
[47:55] in you were clean burn out cause watch
[48:00] what he's saying
[48:01] then he's baptized with the Holy Ghost
[48:03] and with fire cleanse burned out cleaned
[48:06] up and put you in the service of God
[48:08] sanctification only cleanses the
[48:11] vegetable okay
[48:13] are you isn't it let's go a little
[48:16] further on the future I'll go ahead to
[48:22] paragraph 107 you see what happened
[48:29] Christ came and called a church to
[48:30] repentance baptism in the name of Jesus
[48:33] Christ for the remission of sins
[48:35] sanctify the church and with the fire of
[48:38] God come down and burn out all the filth
[48:41] and come and dwells in the human heart
[48:45] God won't come into an unclean vessel
[48:51] you see why brother Branham is right
[48:54] then if you accept him it's wonderful
[48:57] but if everything ain't in the right
[48:59] state in the place he won't accept you
[49:02] if he comes in he's accepted you if he
[49:06] don't come in he hasn't accepted you
[49:11] brother to hell you need to get happy
[49:13] about this Holy Ghost that went you
[49:16] shouted long enough sat down and
[49:19] listened I'm serious but I thought God
[49:24] years ago there's a brother brother Reed
[49:29] he called me up and he said brother Dale
[49:32] I said won't you do me a favor listen
[49:37] what is it he said I want you to go to
[49:40] Jamaica okay because we make plans and
[49:46] talk about it he said I want you to go
[49:50] to one is kin
[49:52] and preach that I got a connection with
[49:59] the bishop I can get you to preach he
[50:04] said they've had a couple of brothers
[50:06] come over a year to Samos you've heard
[50:07] this story okay just go to sleep while
[50:10] the others are listening as a couple of
[50:14] brothers had been over a year to four
[50:16] then and they just tore the place up
[50:17] because they just rip snorted what you
[50:20] gotta believe brother Branham was a
[50:21] prophet if you don't believe it you're
[50:23] lost in it and they really tore up
[50:25] instead of doing any good and he told me
[50:29] what they had done he said but the
[50:31] brother wants somebody to come and
[50:33] explain the message now Here I am going
[50:40] to oneness pentecostals
[50:44] that come down from Bishop Haywood and
[50:47] all of those the black people coming
[50:49] down from Azusa Street they already
[50:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:54] Christ your to hear I'm saying one God
[50:57] but they can do it me I'm an old Baptist
[51:03] that never even come through Pentecost
[51:06] said brother Reed oh I didn't do that he
[51:10] said you come on my mind to get you to

[53:44] them come to me out of service invited
[53:45] me to come preach for you you understand
[53:49] what I'm getting at I was not born and
[53:53] raised in Pentecost but I knew what
[53:56] brother Branham said and I knew this
[53:59] like Ezekiel's and things like that I
[54:01] knew that when I was in the Baptist
[54:03] Church or what that scripture meant so I
[54:05] just took the Bible and went through the
[54:07] Bible with him and they invited me back
[54:11] I preached six services
[54:15] life service ISO voice was gone I had
[54:19] him to put the children you've heard me
[54:21] to it I had him to put the children him
[54:23] done real good him brother Harry so that
[54:25] was really taking care of me it was gone
[54:27] ever not there's preaching to the
[54:29] believers on the message I was left by
[54:31] myself spit to renounce with a sister
[54:35] pastor and his wife you know great
[54:37] people I had them to put the kids up
[54:40] front and I started talking to him this
[54:44] talking is like just enough that I can
[54:46] get as your mom and dad is gonna tell
[54:48] you all about speaking in tongues and
[54:50] what you got to do I said let's just
[54:52] let's just talk a little bit about the
[54:53] Lord Jesus got through there was an
[54:58] altar for first time I've ever seen him
[55:01] buddy tried to make somebody speak in
[55:03] tongues cuz they took the little kids
[55:04] and that I didn't first hide him what
[55:09] are you saying I'm just saying one thing
[55:11] we can take the message in this be
[55:14] people to death with it that don't do no
[55:16] good but to let it be for my heart from
[55:23] a heart that's been through these things
[55:26] see I had been through the experience of
[55:29] justification sanctification and the
[55:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I knew
[55:34] what it was and they had a guy named
[55:36] prophet Clark waiting them knows about
[55:38] and they said he had a discernment and I
[55:41] saw him use it three times and I saw him
[55:44] be right because I was standing up there
[55:47] looking and the three people he went to
[55:50] pray for was the three people that I
[55:52] knew God was dealing with out of 300
[55:55] people herself well when he finished he
[56:01] swung that old hand around and wards me
[56:04] and I thought man he don't tell me off
[56:06] when he does I'm gonna get up and hug
[56:07] his neck he's gonna just tell them what
[56:10] I've been doing all this week he swung
[56:13] that hand around and he said in this man
[56:15] here he ain't told us nothing but the
[56:17] truth all week long oh brother Reid
[56:21] jumped up platform was about this high
[56:23] brother Reed joked up went off the
[56:26] platform out in midair down in the aisle
[56:28] running around and those people a lot of
[56:33] them were seeking God and I wanted to
[56:36] pray with him about it like I said I saw
[56:39] him pick out three people but the three
[56:42] people I see the crowd I would have went
[56:45] to them two three I'm just telling his
[56:47] honest truth
[56:48] but I'm trying to get one thing if you
[56:51] ain't got to hold a ghost in fire then
[56:54] you can be questioned about what it is
[56:57] but just remember the illustration I'm
[57:00] trying to give you that whiteness that
[57:03] thing that new spirit coming
[57:04] everything's working pretty good but
[57:06] you're still you then you ain't burned
[57:09] out so you need a burning out of the
[57:13] Holy Ghost and fire not at this two
[57:16] different time it's the Holy Ghost
[57:18] coming in and then it does it burns out
[57:21] anything that's left in you that is not
[57:24] right and brings his life right in to
[57:27] there to live in you I got one who get
[57:29] on the Statue of a perfect man that I've
[57:32] never seen that one what Ron said when
[57:34] you get born again I told you though
[57:36] about it that when you get born again
[57:38] today's a little light in your soul said
[57:41] it's about the size of a button and he
[57:44] said that just grows and grows I believe
[57:49] that that's the stature of a perfect man
[57:52] it grows and grows until it grows true
[57:56] listen to these others and then we'll
[57:58] quit 1:07 did I finish that one and with
[58:07] the fire of God come down and burn out
[58:09] all the fields and come and dwells in
[58:12] the human heart so just remember one
[58:13] time he is not going to come in to a
[58:17] heart that is not clean you know how you
[58:23] can't pay your way in work your way in
[58:26] and do anything you ain't gonna work
[58:28] he's not coming in to a place that is
[58:32] not burned out what I ask you have you
[58:37] received the Holy Ghost
[58:40] since you believe they remember Apollo
[58:47] they thought that doing pretty good they
[58:51] were having great things taking place
[58:53] Paul said have you received the gift of
[58:56] the Holy Ghost since you believe showing
[58:59] them they did not have the new birth
[59:01] they did not have the baptism when the
[59:04] Holy Ghost
[59:05] because he was asking them since you
[59:07] believed the Baptist says you get it
[59:09] when you believe Paul says you don't
[59:11] you've got to believe first and remember
[59:14] what I'm explaining it's got to come in
[59:16] clean out all the sin burn out all the
[59:19] desires clean everything out and come
[59:22] and put his own life in now there's the
[59:25] new birth well cuz there's the Baptist
[59:29] okay 110 no no but now it has to go
[59:35] through a baptism of fire
[59:36] holy fire from God which cleanses the
[59:39] earth I remember the earth and the
[59:42] person's a saint right what says for the
[59:45] earth for the man the earth goes through
[59:49] justification in the days of Luther the
[59:52] washing off I'm in the days of Noah
[59:54] washing it off sanctification was Jesus
[59:57] dropped his blood on it to cleanse and
[59:59] claim it and one of these days is gonna
[1:00:01] get a fire baptism but I love this you
[1:00:04] and I have stepped up ahead of that
[1:00:06] because we get the justification
[1:00:09] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:11] Ghost and a change of the body it's
[1:00:14] going to be a burning out but I like it
[1:00:19] now I think we ought to realize and let
[1:00:23] it burn it out of us now listen which
[1:00:29] cleanses the earth in heaven so you
[1:00:31] think the earth now listened from the
[1:00:33] days of thank the earth with air for a
[1:00:36] minute
[1:00:37] water cleansed it it didn't make it
[1:00:40] eternal it didn't make it right
[1:00:46] it just made it clean sanctification
[1:00:50] only cleansed and set aside there are
[1:00:53] the better way of saying it
[1:00:55] sanctification really Jesus when he
[1:00:57] dropped his blood on this earth claimed
[1:00:59] it the best way of saying it he claimed
[1:01:03] this earth by his own blood cause he
[1:01:06] wouldn't enough blood to cover the earth
[1:01:07] uh-huh one day it'll get a fiery baptism
[1:01:11] to precede them come in future home all
[1:01:15] right so now listen in its purchase so
[1:01:19] that the redeemed can live on it live in
[1:01:22] it in peace notice the baptism of fires
[1:01:24] to cleanse it from sin from sickness
[1:01:27] from disease germs and from sin never
[1:01:30] this must be left in there after Jesus
[1:01:33] cleanses and claims it that's in the
[1:01:35] world much less so you can see there's a
[1:01:36] lot left in me and you you understand
[1:01:38] what I'm hollering about we think we're
[1:01:41] clean and this that's being who are you
[1:01:52] might like yourself but just remember
[1:01:55] you're a sinner saved by grace
[1:02:01] don't strut too much okay from sinners
[1:02:09] from the devil and all this group now
[1:02:11] remember brother Owen says when that
[1:02:12] holy goes far over there he said it'd
[1:02:14] even burns the devil's eye right well
[1:02:18] what's gonna do it it need to burn the
[1:02:20] devil's out of me and you oh whatever
[1:02:22] I'll tell you what oh I'm gonna tell you
[1:02:24] what I'm really um I've never done
[1:02:26] nothing wrong whether they've been
[1:02:28] throwing off on me now for about three
[1:02:29] weeks he's been beating on me about all
[1:02:31] these things well get your foot out of
[1:02:33] the way I can't step on your toe if you
[1:02:36] ain't got it in the way some of you
[1:02:39] brothers in the military what did they
[1:02:41] have they had a place our that they had
[1:02:43] this machine gun that was just running
[1:02:45] straight across right and you got that
[1:02:47] on your belly and you crawled all the
[1:02:49] way through right well you know what
[1:02:51] whose fault was it is he raised up it
[1:02:55] was your foul but you wasn't gonna do
[1:02:57] that you're gonna hug the mother
[1:02:59] do you got to the other side well that's
[1:03:01] what I'm trying to do get everything I
[1:03:03] can burn out of me now then we're gonna
[1:03:06] have to get over to some more we're
[1:03:09] gonna have to get to some bases to where
[1:03:11] the Prophet was talking about do you sin
[1:03:14] he said a Christian sins daily we still
[1:03:18] got repenting to do we still gotta bring
[1:03:20] a message that Paul brought of how that
[1:03:23] that Holy Ghost will burn out all of
[1:03:26] those things but it's what is it washed
[1:03:28] by the water in the word cleanse and set
[1:03:33] aside
[1:03:34] listen he is to be cast out into the
[1:03:39] lake of fire
[1:03:40] holy fire from God comes down from God
[1:03:42] out of heaven and burns it up notice to
[1:03:45] make it ready for the God to dwell in
[1:03:48] and God in the new world that is to come
[1:03:51] is to dwell in the earth cause you say
[1:03:54] God he dwells in the human heart see you
[1:03:58] that's where you say you said but he
[1:03:59] lives in the human heart but he and the
[1:04:03] bride becomes one and they go to their
[1:04:05] home in the new world both world and the
[1:04:11] person they can live in it see the heart
[1:04:14] has to be cleanse like that now to the
[1:04:17] individual before God can come down in
[1:04:19] the person of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:04:23] Christ coming down and dwell in the
[1:04:25] human heart it's first must be repented
[1:04:28] it must be baptized in water in his name
[1:04:32] to show who it belongs to
[1:04:34] then it must be cleansed by the blood of
[1:04:36] Jesus and then the holy fire and Holy
[1:04:40] Ghost
[1:04:41] from God comes down and burns out all of
[1:04:44] the desires of sin all the nature of the
[1:04:48] world and therefore he that sins
[1:04:51] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[1:04:52] of the truth there remaineth no more
[1:04:54] okay what about it alright
[1:05:00] what about it do you understand what I'm
[1:05:05] driving in justification don't burn out
[1:05:10] the things out another's sanctification
[1:05:14] only gets rid of the snake because we're
[1:05:17] still us then we wouldn't say all we
[1:05:24] want to do on it and the devil made me
[1:05:25] do it
[1:05:31] what he brother Ron say come on
[1:05:34] what brother Ron said he said you went
[1:05:40] out to him if he does something said he
[1:05:44] didn't come in to you because it was
[1:05:46] already burnt out and clean he said you
[1:05:49] went out right come on church I hope you
[1:05:58] follow what I'm talking about
[1:06:01] because I've I've tried I I asked the
[1:06:04] Lord how do I do this how do I explain
[1:06:06] this what I do see like I tell you you
[1:06:09] say you don't believe it order to do
[1:06:11] what you want to shake it whatever call
[1:06:13] me exalted I've been preaching this for
[1:06:15] almost 50 years or so I'm not worried
[1:06:17] about
[1:06:19] I've got tapes back to 2002 so we'll go
[1:06:26] that far back and see how many times I
[1:06:28] preached on the new birth color is only
[1:06:31] like a two or three years ago we were on
[1:06:32] a whole series don't you see I believe
[1:06:36] it I've experienced it I'm trying to
[1:06:41] tell you the disciples three and a half
[1:06:44] years God let that happen to work that
[1:06:48] we could follow each of their steps
[1:06:50] instead of just said Putin there it is
[1:06:54] they had to go through all of those
[1:06:56] steps you and I have to then he lets
[1:07:01] people like me come alone the church I
[1:07:06] never did right I never did smoke I
[1:07:09] never did cuss I like my face to stay
[1:07:13] there
[1:07:13] it was the easy way to get you nose
[1:07:18] turned is to have a smart-aleck mouth I
[1:07:23] always tried to get along to everybody
[1:07:25] not compromise no no no never would
[1:07:28] they just tase it go and leave me alone
[1:07:30] now just don't fool with me I don't want
[1:07:34] to fool with you at all
[1:07:34] have you heard me tell you tonight at
[1:07:37] the Baptist Church before I've joined
[1:07:39] the church they come to me trying to get
[1:07:41] me to come to the church and get say I
[1:07:42] said listen I live a better life and
[1:07:44] you're Deacon board does I wasn't
[1:07:47] backing up they knew I knew who was
[1:07:50] doing what
[1:07:53] that's just he also told one of them one
[1:07:56] time I went to this deacon and they had
[1:07:59] told us about him and if I ever come to
[1:08:02] one of you you better believe on one
[1:08:03] time when I come get ready
[1:08:06] God we don't talk about five minutes
[1:08:08] about something I went to that Deacon
[1:08:10] one day cause he is accused of running
[1:08:12] around which is running around with
[1:08:15] somebody else got his wife indeed I said
[1:08:20] if I ever find out you're wrong I'll
[1:08:22] take you to the church I said do you
[1:08:26] understand what honey I said I meant I
[1:08:31] will physically take you to the church
[1:08:36] because I've never been one that liked
[1:08:38] to play with religious matters sometimes
[1:08:42] I said I'll take you before the church
[1:08:46] when he finally wound up getting shot
[1:08:50] but I was done gone I didn't have to put
[1:08:53] up with a note I'm just telling you
[1:08:57] Church I've always tried to live a life
[1:08:58] before Christ and before people and I
[1:09:01] know I fail every day my wife can tell
[1:09:03] you she even talked to you she knows I
[1:09:06] don't live a perfect life I have my
[1:09:07] problems I have my ups and downs but
[1:09:12] I've tried because the reason I've tried
[1:09:15] is to try to preach the word to you
[1:09:20] preach to you about justification
[1:09:23] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:25] Ghost
[1:09:28] yeah a funny thing come on musician had
[1:09:31] a funny thing back right before coming
[1:09:34] to message and I was talking to a couple
[1:09:39] of friends of mine when I was a
[1:09:40] Methodist preacher nothing was a Baptist
[1:09:41] we just how services are at work
[1:09:43] overnight well we had like a 30-minute
[1:09:47] time we had services I've seen people
[1:09:49] pray far I've seen them healed and ever
[1:09:50] prayed for the baptisms right there just
[1:09:52] for life start up pray for the line is
[1:09:54] set there long enough for them to do it
[1:09:56] you know but listen I tried drive this
[1:10:04] to talk to them about Jesus Christ just
[1:10:10] like I'm trying to talk to you about
[1:10:15] just be sensible about your life and
[1:10:19] think about it think where you come from
[1:10:22] and what you're doing I told you the
[1:10:26] other day about it
[1:10:27] always wondered if I could take you to
[1:10:28] somebody slap my job I had a man just
[1:10:31] laugh at one day I stood there looked at
[1:10:34] him grinned back at him and he turned
[1:10:39] and walked off he knew and I knew too
[1:10:44] but I knew that thing was gone I thank
[1:10:51] God for that opportunity
[1:10:53] that that could happen to me few minutes
[1:10:57] or 30 minutes hours will he come back
[1:10:59] apart apologize listen church its Holy
[1:11:08] Ghost and fire there's anything left in
[1:11:11] us if we have the new birth you know one
[1:11:14] thing for sure it was all burnt out or
[1:11:18] he's not coming in well what's the
[1:11:20] problem with him not coming in a lot of
[1:11:22] people it's not going out and I'm saying
[1:11:25] this and the seriousness from my heart a
[1:11:28] lot of people don't know that they need
[1:11:32] to be justified and sanctified and
[1:11:34] filled with the baptism when the Holy
[1:11:36] Ghost our know what happens in each
[1:11:38] stage
[1:11:40] to be able to tell you could take
[1:11:42] somebody come up here and they'd say
[1:11:45] brother Dale I want to be prayed far for
[1:11:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I said
[1:11:47] okay we're pray for it but let's talk a
[1:11:49] little bit cuz most people just want to
[1:11:52] pray and get you emotionally and I'm not
[1:11:54] against that I believe in every bit of
[1:11:55] it I'm more emotional than anybody in
[1:11:58] this building and you think once a smart
[1:12:01] you just don't walk in these shoes
[1:12:03] now I love the Lord I've always just had
[1:12:08] that there's a higher to see well these
[1:12:11] are allowed that okay if I miss it I
[1:12:16] ain't worried about it he's giving me
[1:12:18] what I asked for
[1:12:19] I asked for my family and he gave me a
[1:12:23] scripture it says you will be there with
[1:12:28] your offspring you say all your kid's
[1:12:31] gonna be saved because of years know all
[1:12:32] my kids gonna be safe because God's
[1:12:34] gonna get to working on and he's gonna
[1:12:36] burden them and he's gonna drive them to
[1:12:39] their knees because that's what I'm
[1:12:41] praying for
[1:12:42] you're praying for the I'm praying for
