========================================

there's been happen more today yes what a pitiful dipping out one day hello there we climb a crown you will up with your mouth gonna have my land back my riddle always good to see everyone a good see nothing but was today good hey was random and good have this cable isn't she absolutely brought Nathaniel with her no you didn't regard that thank you we'll pour l'amour down that's her part okay all right he just allows you to ride in it drop it okay dry all right now you should be here today have brother Brady insist agree with us bring up some baby speaking both services and thanks to Nate and Jaclyn for bringing them down and taking a backbend they're over drivers this week all right now we have went through the four seals we went to the fifth seal and now we're on the sixteen now as we said before when you talk about the seals everybody says well they're open and you know and that's it but being that they're open and that brother rented it was some greatest messages he'd ever preached right okay so when you say it never worked in this round before ever right all the healings and all this and that the other that happened in the prophets when bees did nothing compared to the opening of these sealed so we just read the booklet on chef yeah huh we just read the book Klingon ship while it broke up the profit well if they don't bring it to you right that book is still looking it's got to break to you just as it broke to the profits oh go away well sorry if just way then come on it's got to break to you yeah I'm not going in on William Brown revelation that's right I'm going in on my own revelation all right so the revelation of these seals is like me and brother Bob was talking last Sunday and I want to cover this in case somebody does I'll have a question this book is not these seven seals did not reveal the devil right like people think that it is they say this is the seventh sealed book of the rivet of the revealing of the devil it's not the probability God told us in the brief this is the seventh sealed book of what Redemption so there must be some redemptive property inside these seals because we know it does expose the Antichrist we know the Bible says that he will be revealed okay but what are you going to do with him when he is revealed because when it was revealed to the Prophet he saw the wild horse rider riding away from him here stands the land above him there goes one more correct right something was leaving what because in Redemption what caused us just have to be redeemed the devil this way he caused through Eve and Adam Adam don't believe come from from Satan it didn't come from guidance okay so because of that unbelief we've got to turn this thing back around to what the devil's done and we got to see that now he yelled about this so close to leave the seeds are very lad well he's here I was thinking about this morning you know Satan is very going we know that Satan is very religious he was more if he's been more religious than you've been because before the foundation of the world God created him and he was the worship angel and he turned away from God before there was even a world right did not let Satan fault and then he was cast down where gas down when the earth was made he was cast down into the garden properly God killed at that see so we're able to understand them I've always said this is what the seals mean to me it tells me where I come from what I'm doing here and where I'm doing okay because you know what if we know where we came from and if we know what we're doing here and we know where we're going see that answers all the questions there's no fear atoms fear was and he didn't know what was going to happen that when I don't walked up before God and God said what you do he said I was afraid he didn't know what was going to happen that but if we know now by the tactics of the devil what he's doing and that we can combat the devil with that with the opening of these sails what does it do it causes because remember I seem of the other day Jesus walked on the earth a human man needed to eat meat go to the bathroom had problems in his body but he was Almighty go I'm human flesh a man and the devil's dead camped him but without sandy said now with the new birth we're supposed to be the same way with the new birth we're supposed to be to all brother wait I got these problems well we all got problems Jesus had problem yeah man but he did not have to get up every morning say I'm god I got act like no you guys been doing what what woman's side thought he was it any lower things he saw her he's learning his soul he was Almighty God I was the creator but he learned in his humanity of the different things that he had to do and he I would say if you were to look at his commentary into those 29 years that there was no nothing going on you know the silent year they call it he is a human male almost a human the second I don't believe he walked through the world and never have cut or brisbin's ourself and he was so human he need he can enter into all of our infirmities yes he can enter into every temptation we have he can enter into it why because he took on that in in his life and I was thinking though they were talking about angels as the Bible says other night the Bible even says that angels came to Jesus in the garden to watch strengthening so angels are there you say the strengthen it was strengthening the man you can't strengthen the soul of God he sorry there's no there's no I'm full and empty and then now hat flowing out I'm here you need a full a daughter you die you know these are gotten the baptism of Holy Ghost in your soul or you got to build in there there's no little area that's over here you know that burner burns it completely out puts that new nature in its what will come like the major cleansing with a sixth seal so what are you saying by the way well you can take the doses you can take the girl and said the words you can take the words of the seals now that was written by John right on the aisle tactics but now remember when the thunders were going to sound the revelations Tim he told you on not arriving right now to me to me this is this is me the world sees seven seals or six seals really there's no there's no opening of the seventh seal as far as we get opening something happens it opened this house was in heaven you know there was nobody there was nothing happened I mean all these things happen first seal we had one God and justification the man sanctification the word to clean you out white red black and mixed okay and now we come to the fifth seal which show that a group of people who didn't walk good what's reading right what's giving eternal life the fifth seal G this just you need know Jesus was actually their ancestors turning down and that's being the Messiah but God is going to give them eternal life for what for the testimony they held would you regard people we're Jehovah's people we just missed the part that when we come to the sixth seal through two prophets they're going to tell them that they miss the Messiah coming he could look this little still thinks my thoughts coming they're preparing I mean they're getting all these natural things ready all right they're getting there trying to find the Ark they're trying to find this or trying to find that why can put everything together because God said it you'll never erect this tabernacle I'll come do it but remember the Bible's already spoken said that the tabernacle is not in buildings and stoning and would be in a fleshly tables of your heart so that part they missed that's right that's why this is the secret part so to me to me the thunders is the voice of God when the seal breaks now when the seal breaks and you see that the wild horse riders enterprise that's not it that's already written I think in the other day we talked about this a little more but those seven thunders brother rebel they said well around that those seven thunders would be something so wonderful he said we'll have to compare with every scripture in the Bible now what one thing puts everything together in the Bible that one word I told you about they never forget Redemption from Genesis chapter 1 to Revelation chapter 22 is nothing cause all these thing s but it's nothing more than Reventon last so to compare with our scripture in the Bible the thunders must have to do with the redemption of man not the exposing or the revealing of the hell bucum okay got it all right don't forget that word brother Elsa don't cross Dimitri's and don't forget that word redemption why you say Genesis 1 God created heaven earth why do you create heaven are for us a little yes right and then all the foam and all that horrible stuff happens bottom all the way through but what is the whole Bible everybody Old Testament at Abraham Kuyper addiction yes he went through justifications advocating the price that's why people we kind of look and see that it's not defenders is not some secret book yes not some secret tape that we have to find amongst women and already in the Bible is God compared with what there's one thing brother brown rice wine told y'all I love that future home book he gets up the 1964-65 and he says thank God that when I come to this future home and saw that though the cleansing of the earth was going to be those three stages justification safe occasion he saw taught that as a boy and I'll never varied from it one out ok so I feel believe in the book of redemption that's what that's called a book of redemption why because they still resisting people in that book right then Randa devil is not redeemable so let's kick him up that's right so let's take that fall out that this sentence that are six healed because remember six seals to probably tell this finishes Redemption because the Seventh Seal is Christ himself he's all of it together right right okay but six sealed brings us to Redemption just like the six fold purpose in Dane Sims week brings Israel three two prophets to total Redemption because remember they're going to be redeemed then they're going to die then they're going resurrection what same as us but some of us are not going to die the same thing exactly so to me the continuity of the whole Bible everybody's worried about the thunders being then listened the Thunder is the voice of God when that seal break now not when the seals read the seal was written 2,000 years ago by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos written on this paper but now remember Jesus preached them in Matthew 24 before that we're going to read that today we're going to try to read it we were already running on God the let's read this because now we're going to take this and what we've been doing is we've been taking the natural happening of the seal because there is an actual happens okay because it's it seals naturally going to happen there's going to be earthquakes there's going to be a total disruption of nature run around said but see what's that got to do with us if six seals listen if six seals finishes Redemption we got to be redeemed over that six sealed but the rapture takes place under the fourth seat okay so we got a lap back got all that bit back everything laps over and God remembers all the church ages we talked about of Church ages surely they drew them separated but brother Brown says they left over so they kind of do you know one laps over the other I'll make them laugh so you take these seals in the four silver after takes place well as we said before if the prophet says wrapped in that pleasure on the fourth seal then something has to happen to a group of people to take a body check yeah something has to happen because right in here after the resurrection happens the body change happens and the rapture happens right on this seal so we don't throw five and six out five and six is a higher form of what you already got probably God told us I believe in the visible union he said there's there's a higher form of justification there's a higher form of sanctification Paul said I die daily well now he died one time when he was getting Christian he died right and the new man came in but no wife Paul has to say I die daily this man the nature that gives you the body spirit soul and that spirit realm is not born again only in your soul are you born again and I've told you before this place doesn't mean anything we we talked about and I'm sorry you hear message preachers talk about the flesh this flesh is nothing more than a mechanism for what's on the inside your body your natural body cannot sin yeah brother it can't it was born in saying this but after our problem that's the reason I live you know bp3 bump itself telling that 6353 I thought man bro thank you then go sitting there under Sun suits me long long way learn what it say man this body though think about it hit somebody in the head say a child was born and this is the heart to deal with sickles's work on that black we're talking about I mean we're going by nature we're going about your nature which is in your memory reason conscious affection imagination all right clearly if you're born again today your soul is already retaining waiting for the redemption of the body right that's gorgeous character waiting the redemption of the body so - Michael me waiting whether we're dead - hey honey get him Sam you can throw me other yeah yeah hey brother Daniel this brother down he is I can't introduce all these people but you'll get to meet them we're good to have you with us I'm your worst nightmare okay alright yeah brings up anyway hi so look so we looking at the body the by the flesh of your body cannot send yes morning saying it's a product the same thing but what motivates my fighting to do what I do it's not my skeletal what its motivated from what's inside because when I was not a Christian this hand withhold beer this mouth will speak by all things right cursings and all that but now God didn't throw my body away and bring me a new body and then put it here and then him good here solely myself no he cleaned me up from the inside so that the motivator of the beer-drinkin ins of all the is gone so that's not least I got this man still can hold a beer I still hand you a beer I still say those things I used to say thank God I thought anymore yeah but I've always said this mouth is confusing when I was in the world I could kill you with my spear day don't you okay right I could really make you feel bad but now I hope that God is using it now to help people to forward the kingdom of God instead of forward in the kingdom of the devil alright so we see the seals and these seals that are not just surface written on a piece of paper this is what it is because this is a book of redemption the Bible is a book of redemption sure it exposes or reveals the wicked one i scripture for them the mouths and will be revealed but as he's been made known what's what's happening there's a separation because still in your nature see if you think about your problem is your memory that's my problem I remember the things I used today your conscious right your imagination more than that gives you imagine every reason reason your reasoning conscious imagination and affection because remember you don't love with your soul you love either God or the devil with that part right but you love your wife family with a goth a love in your soul the filial love is all the love for your family right you feel you'll love agape love it and like I told you before you say Adam in the Garden of Eden what happens in the garden between even the Beast agape love had to take over because filial love he would have killed her come the Bible says later on that the woman lay with the babies to the kill her in debates drivers the watch took over when the doctor loved took over inside and said no she's part of me follow my home she was literally fond of his ball team and you've been married 38 years but we are not DNA the same right right but Adam and Eve DNA test you took our DNA and a DNA to be exactly the same it be the same person now look that's what's going to happen in Redemption because the bulges will have a body like unto his glorious body your DNA is going to be changed that's why so change you'll be changed in a moment in 2011 ah now your features won't be changed right but we're going to have a glorified body that has been our atoms are going to have to be changed into his image when Jesus came back resurrected ascension come back or said I have to go to the Father and he come back he were the he was here 30 40 days and the glorified body a man that was immortal right all that on the face of the earth for 30 to 40 days right nothing harmony to eat but yeah you could walk through that wall right right there's no limitations well that's the body we're going to have yes right so I programmed these bodies can't meet Jesus in the form there in that doesn't mean the thorn it means a position because this comes from my mom in my day okay and this can't go but this can't change so Jesus's body was changed it wasn't dumped out somewhere like some people said he dumped the desert he got a new one no AJ he still had male friends in his hand he still has them he was he it was but when he resurrected it was all the work life okay alright so that was bored by flesh see our problem is we drive war how the flesh now that's our problem we glorify the flesh now no we don't glory in flesh for flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of look about us alright so these seals then has to be something there has to be a thunder or a voice of glad that opens up that shows you some form of redemption that man has never seen before to me that's the seal the seals abduct a white horse riders Deanna Conner the white horse riders the excuse me the white righteous church that goes wrong and then the red is just someone sent them because that's fine that's history right I saw brother after the hitch the history that the mystery is now history the mystery has been main oh right the mysteries being made no we're saying is we know where he sees it and it's not always the wrong catheter okay you come here down here before you did because when you don't come right he's a church but you're not here for you do it leave that beast baseball but the still throw this a little bit of time is driving out that unclean spirit you shall have an unclean spirit number one you need to get rid of the line when you look at it this is gonna be quick I know you're gonna last three questions ready oh no that's okay that's why I look quick so anyway now let's finally read this scripture after 40 minutes so you get what I'm saying I know what you do with all of your new these seals are not just revealing in the Antichrist it's got to be I thought the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ and if that's the book of redemption they've got to be redemptive a redemptive plan being made known that's ready all right so see that van brings the Thunder gonna make some simple instead of everybody in the message making them some way out you're under in the cloud and and it's seven people and it gives you two wives and you just everything else that's not but I can compare everything we're talking about whatever strips from the Bible because I'm still in Redemption I'm still in the plan of redemption all right so if I stay in the plan of redemption then then I think they maybe we're headed in the right direction if we stay in the plan of redemption never leave that justification segregation baptism oh just bring it up a little high bring it up a little higher bring up a little high because truly like you said before you got justification when you were born again dropped off your fasting sanctification was the unclean spirit goes out of a man Waltzing Dry places seeking rest - none right God had entered in yet nobody in there yet all right but then you see the new man or are the new birth where what you're born again it's new all right and your nature is dead that's why dating if you'll if you'll see what I'm saying the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first this people end in the grave that are born-again Christians are not day and I hope you all said they're sleeping they're sleeping you've got to be dead in Christ while you're alive on this earth hey you gotta go ahead finally ok day after day but you gotta be dead in Christ here so the dead in Christ shall rise first that's right not the people that go out there to the grave goal they're dead if they're a Christian they're more alive now than they were when they were walking right right how to quit preaching we are to start back in sentence come on nice nice to know really all are three different and then yeah yeah you're right so the third seal is a black horse you said what's that got to do that's your old nature dying right remembers probably glosses you can't divorce him remember users can't marry if you're dope he's divorcing but now if your husband dies you're free to marry same way in Christ okay alright so your nature has to be dead the oh you and I brother bastard you can't just hold it you can't just open the closet door hanging him up and using when you need that means not dated a man if you're old lessman's dead you're free to marry yes crying right right all right so you got a damn nature then the fourth seal that's what is it what is a cogent I'm a beekeeper so I get all these free paints so I took white black red you mix them together because remember the fourth horse is a pale horse it's all these three mixed together right all right and it's a putrid color when you make white and red you're black you just don't have a name you walk up the load and you see this legal claim they got a name for every paint color in the world you know they don't have one below cuz it's pale but you taste up take the positive side of that that when you get born again what comes to you the word the word is born again in your soul and you start living it and it starts becoming part of you yes right so that's the three mixed together which is the Eagle anointing we went through we're going where the the Bible tells us that the combat beast which is the line Hawks man an eagle we get out of Ezekiel is the Holy Ghost in the believers there right that's the nature of the Holy Ghost inside of you a lion nature and ox nature of man nature Niko that you because you need that you need that fullness name of no other man : I thought you said focus now all the fun no boldness and this nuts not a lying spirit eaters like a lion spirit right the lion spirit then the Hawks is what label with you brother labor labor labor record an officer's not fast but he pulls a lot of load okay then you got you got to have intelligence because you got to get it up here first gotta come here burger you got to run it through like I said you got to run through this filter this is your holy host filter and then see what's going on right then you got the eagle anointing which is what prophetic the lion is about this tall well these diagraphs this call he can't stay a long way but he's powerful he ever gets close to you he'll kill you but you can't see see understand the office is a little taller you can see further understand okay alright then you got the man well here we are we're standing up above the bushes and we have enough intelligence to take us higher we counter it we get an airport alright so the intelligence then the eagle he goes higher than than any animal and he can see north south east and west with no limitation so that's why we have the in eagle anointing in this a we are all prophetic to a degree we're not prophets that's right we're prophetic people all right because why we can understand something that's never been understood before right Martin Luther was and John Leslie and some of those old teachers of the message of the message their message would love to be not sent here listening to me I'm nothing but he'd love to see the word open up where they had a real narrow view of the word but it didn't he gave the word being there right told you with binoculars you know you can only see a certain field of view right if you get a better set of binoculars it doesn't negate everything that's around you it just makes it we can see better so Martin Luther John Wesley and all those coming through coming along with the profit program he went up higher than anybody else but that doesn't mean he went up there and we stay down here if the age is anointed if the age has an eagle one morning then we're supposed to rise up he told us we were eaglets were to rise up and be able to what seed not see the eye but understand yeah see means to understand come Jesus said I'm going away and the world will watch seeming understand me no more but you'll see because we don't physically see Jesus we may see him in a vision who may seem in the picture but we physically are not standing here looking at the man gene all right but I see him by the I revelation and he's becoming more clear that he's not too under somewhere he's right here and then and he's just waiting on being you to get off and home offered up and on our feet you know that stuff right my football coach hook said he did either leave follow God way that stands into my way - let's read this point we have no time and I'll be helping to open the sixth seal now we're in the sixth seal now so we went to the four seals we're just finished yet we just now starting on the sixth seal and I put a little bullet points or characteristics so let's read it and then we'll go back to it and I'll be held man open the sixth seal handles open you know people know message that's close well to them it is yeah to them it's close amen if they say that still too close I say Amen to you now the hill we have opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake so we're talking about a natural event now let me back up just another second this fifth seal is happening in another dimension it's not happening in this dimension so John had to go into another dimension to see the souls under the altar right the fifth sealed you souls under the altar they had been killed under Ivan Hitler fire and that we're given white robes because of their testimony large event do that so we see that now we call it to the sixth seal now say still brings us right back here so these are mass this is what's going to happen it's just natural happenings on the earth that's why put nature cleansing them cuz remember when man fell in the garden what fell below it all nature yeah well my brother Lemmons wind it up hey these these people are picking up there they got to go up a little bit higher you go into Romans 8 the whole creation is groaning and waiting for what the manifestation of the dogs of the cat no the manifestation of the sons of noise we've got right right okay so now and I'll be all may open the sixth year there was a great earthquake so it became black as sackcloth of hair that's going to happen Monday you know that don't you we'll have a total solar eclipse and it's going to pass right over here people are flocking to North Georgia because it's done nothing Raven and pounds and union all those counties and it's going to be a total eclipse for several minutes stars are gonna come out and the temperatures gonna start driving okay so it's not gonna happen few minutes but this right here but now what is the cause of this because this is a natural occurrence but what happens the Sun became a sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood we're going to have blood moons and all that well I'm not going into that pillow study definitely and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth I think another day everybody's going resurrected watching Russia watch Russian he didn't say get enamored with Russia right he said good watching don't sit there all day and worry about Russia just watching let's be careful yeah okay I mean what can we do what can we do kind of silly but I'll promise you one thing everything that's happening in this natural world it's because what we're getting in the spiritual world the Bride of Christ because I'm telling you the bride is what God is dealing with right now he's not down with nobody else he's dealing with right that's right in deal if he won't listen he wants that honeymoon mom what if Kaitlyn and good to be here yeah first name Nathaniel we got married and then said well about three years from now we'll have any money oh my please mom quit please hey Rob wouldn't I mean let's go natural after up with it well Jesus Christ has waited 2000 years to have his honeymoon with this bride like he's always wanted and he's going to get and we're writing to throw up I mean rise the door we've already had a ceremony we're born again down here we're his lover where it is where his bride amen but he wants to consummate even with us go honeymoon we're consummated down here but he must go on that honeymoon of rest idea and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even with the fig tree casteth her untimely figs when shaken mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll rolled together they were mouth and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth now what I was telling you before this is not just going to happen to Israel we know through to prophets they're going to preach a message to redeem 144,000 people that's what the vol said in Revelation to believe 7 or 12 we'll read it come up next Sunday we can't read this dunya and the kings of the earth so what happened is these two problems are not just calm down judgment on Israel because we got to remember type it back with Israel in the Old Testament I'm reading in Exodus now all of the plagues happened to Egypt and Israel is in Goshen when they will darkness so dark where you couldn't see in front of your face the Bible says it was lightened ocean what a lot a bunch of Egyptians standing there looking out over a complete dark not to be able to see nothing but a little bit alive back about 20 miles from from Egypt out there in the desert and they look like they've got a be my life you know coming up well got the scariest people me told of me would go to the ocean okay Kerry but the kings of the earth what I'm telling you is this whole world is going to be turned upside down because we're going to talk next on you about the spiritual part because when you got warning in your world turned upside that right well I started working on your nature your nature cleansing right in the kings of the earth and great man the rich man chief captain mighty man every bondman and every free man not living their money out his themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains consider the mountains in the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of wrath has come who shall be able to stand now let's go to tell you what when I went to next week there's not time at all to do this but let's go to math you can read it because we know that that Jesus himself preached the seals right Matthew 24 alright so we covered every one of those because why Jesus without the pardon and Jesus tells them know that they're getting excited to the temple it won't be once no less than another they asked him probably three things once y'all sound like coming into the world Tuesday all right jesus said 'take heed no man deceive you so he starts telling them the seal so all these are the seal in here we've already read them and I want time to go back rhythm here all right then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you should be hated of all nations from remain safe then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another don't you see that happening now and many more prophets shall rise and shall deceive many you see that definitely hasn't run now because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold I'll like this right here but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and you keep seeing all this you let them see my watch he's talking about Israel right but then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning the world to this time where she'll been except those days shall be shortened it should be less safe trying to run out of time then any man shall say lo here is Christ believe it not the watch you throw out the son of man immediately I was a tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened the moon shall not give her light we just present restores your fall from heaven relations with this river blessing and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven see we see the signs on man here we see it here but silence no man guarding human flesh is going to be shown left then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory but that denomination will God Comey said I'll be glad when Jesus coke down through the skies and split the eastern skies and we see them coming up when that happens you've already missed the restroom so this is after the rapture basically all right it just when everybody seeking I thought about doing the secret catching one and he shall send His angels a great sound of a trumpet that shall gather together the elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other and then he starts talking about Israel which is always the fig tree so now next Sunday will read revelation where the two prophets come in so you got two prophets there's a nature cleansing for remember I read in Romans 8 that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth wing or what macrophages from the gun but now there's another thing that I want to show you if the spoken word through two prophets they don't just read they don't you read well it says it that there's supposed to be an earthquake so let's talk about her place today hey Moses hey Elijah with one with what no they know exactly what to do when he's in here they are versed in the scripture and they have the spirit of Moses and Elijah upon them and they're going to speak the word and it's going to happen but I'll promise you one thing before we leave this earth that spoken word is going to happen right here hey [Music]
