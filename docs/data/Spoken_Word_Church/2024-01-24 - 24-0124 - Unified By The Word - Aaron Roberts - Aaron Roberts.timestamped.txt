[20:59] Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians
[21:04] 4 and verse
[21:08] one and we're going to read through 13
[21:11] it says I therefore the prisoner of the
[21:13] Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of
[21:15] the vocation wherewith ye are called
[21:17] with all loneliness and meekness and
[21:19] with longsuffering forbearing one
[21:21] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[21:23] unity of the spirit in the bond of
[21:27] peace there is one body and one Spirit
[21:30] even as ye are called in one hope of
[21:32] your calling one Lord One Faith one
[21:34] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[21:37] above all and through all and in you all
[21:40] but unto every one of us is given Grace
[21:43] according to the measure of the gift of
[21:45] Christ wherefore ye saith when he
[21:48] ascended up on high he led captivity
[21:50] captive and gave gifts unto men now that
[21:53] he Ascent ascended what is it but that
[21:57] he also de ascended first into lower
[21:59] parts of the earth he that descended is
[22:01] the same also that ascended up far above
[22:05] all Heavens that he might feel all
[22:08] things and he gave some Apostles and
[22:10] some prophets and some evangelists and
[22:12] some pastors and teachers for the
[22:14] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[22:16] the ministry for the edifying of the
[22:18] body of Christ till we all come into the
[22:21] unity of faith and of the knowledge of
[22:23] the Son of God unto a perfect man unto
[22:26] unto the measure
[22:28] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[22:31] and then we'll flip over to 1
[22:33] Corinthians chapter 12 and we'll begin
[22:36] at verse
[22:37] 12 very familiar
[22:40] scripture and it says for as the for as
[22:42] the body is one and half many members
[22:45] and all the members of that one body
[22:47] being many are one body so also is
[22:51] Christ for by one Spirit we're all
[22:53] baptized into one body whether we be
[22:55] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[22:57] free and have all been made to drink
[22:59] into that one into one spirit for the
[23:02] body is not one member but many if the
[23:06] foot shall say because I am not the hand
[23:08] am I not of the body is it not is it
[23:11] therefore not of the body and if the ear
[23:14] shall say because I am not the eye I am
[23:17] not of the body is it therefore not of
[23:19] the body if the whole body were an eye
[23:22] where were the hearing if the whole were
[23:25] hearing where were the smelling but but
[23:28] now God but now hath God set the members
[23:31] every one of them in the body as it hath
[23:34] pleased him amen God bless you you may
[23:37] be seated
[23:38] tonight and just want to read verse 20
[23:44] here
[23:46] says it says but now there are many
[23:50] members yet but one body and he says now
[23:54] ye are the body of Christ and members in
[23:59] particular and tonight I want to speak
[24:00] on being unified by the
[24:04] word and I love I love this scripture
[24:07] here where it talks
[24:09] about where Paul picks up in Ephesians
[24:12] and he begins to talk about what God
[24:16] done that he came to bring us through
[24:18] the spirit to bring us all into one body
[24:22] and he brings us all through all
[24:24] these all these things and we see that
[24:28] what he done he but he through all this
[24:32] of what he
[24:33] done because the work that he done on
[24:37] Calvary what he done to BR bring us in
[24:40] to fellowship with him to bring us into
[24:43] this body so by one Spirit we're all
[24:46] baptized into that body by his grace we
[24:49] were brought into that and because of
[24:51] what he done and brought us into that
[24:53] then it says it say he says that he gave
[24:57] some apostles of prophets and he said he
[24:59] gave evangelist pastors and teachers for
[25:02] the perfecting of that because we
[25:04] started on it we started God started on
[25:06] a path with us because he brought us in
[25:09] there but for us to come to our
[25:10] Perfection there's only one way that God
[25:12] has called people and that is through a
[25:14] five-fold Ministry because the scripture
[25:17] tells us that how he's going to how he's
[25:19] going to do this how he's going to bring
[25:21] us through and the only way that you're
[25:23] going to be unified how you're going to
[25:26] come to this place to perfecting of the
[25:28] Saints for us to be edified together to
[25:32] edify the body of Christ there's only
[25:33] one way to do that and that is through
[25:36] the word and the word puts a five-fold
[25:39] Ministry because God always works
[25:41] through a man he had his prophets that
[25:43] come to speak through the word through
[25:45] all down through history down Through
[25:47] the Ages we've all seen how God spoke to
[25:49] man and God had a man that he gave him
[25:52] the vision of what he wanted and that
[25:54] man began to speak and God brought that
[25:56] man through and he called him to do that
[25:58] job and no matter what come against him
[26:01] he always overcome because the word went
[26:03] forth and God had a vision of what was
[26:05] going to take place and it didn't matter
[26:07] how many de devils in Hell came against
[26:09] it it wasn't going to stop the plan of
[26:11] God and he always he always overcame and
[26:15] brothers and sisters we have we have
[26:17] received a message in our day we have
[26:20] received the word in our day we have
[26:22] received what God give us what came
[26:24] directly from the mind of God came in
[26:26] our day and spoke to us to bring us to a
[26:29] place because what God visioned in his
[26:31] mind you and I are the people that's
[26:33] been called to that vision and let me
[26:35] tell you if he if it was in the past
[26:38] when when Moses walked on the earth and
[26:40] there was no devils in hell that was
[26:42] going to stop them but they were going
[26:43] to bring forth and when when Joshua
[26:46] walked through through the land of
[26:48] promise him and Caleb walked through and
[26:50] saw the vision of what what God told
[26:52] Moses and he spoke to them and they
[26:54] walked through that and he came across
[26:56] and they told him said we're more than
[26:57] able to take the land because we've seen
[27:00] it because exactly what the prophet has
[27:02] said is just sayith the Lord and you
[27:04] know what I've seen it with my own eyes
[27:05] and you know what there's nobody's going
[27:07] to stop me because I have received a
[27:09] spirit that's inside of me that has
[27:11] quickened me that I know what my
[27:13] possession is and it didn't matter that
[27:15] Caleb had to wait 40 years to come into
[27:18] that place that he walked in because
[27:19] when he was old and gray and stoop
[27:21] shouldered and everything like that it
[27:23] didn't change who he was because when he
[27:26] come back in there later he told Joshua
[27:28] he said I'm just as capable to take this
[27:30] land as I was when I walked through it
[27:32] God called me to this place and
[27:35] nothing's going to stop me well let me
[27:37] tell you brothers and sisters the same
[27:38] promise waits for you and I because you
[27:41] and I have been called to this place
[27:43] that you know what there's somebody
[27:44] that's standing on the face of the Earth
[27:45] that has heard the end time message and
[27:47] that will take a body change that's what
[27:50] you and I have been called
[27:53] to God has called us well thank God that
[27:56] I have that I have rece received the
[27:58] understanding the Revelation to
[28:00] understand that God has called men in
[28:02] this last day that have given the been
[28:03] given the word to speak to us for us to
[28:06] come to the place that we all can become
[28:08] in in unity of the word that we can all
[28:11] come to the place where we all come to
[28:13] the unity of the faith the unity of the
[28:15] spirit that we all can walk worthy of
[28:17] the vocation that God has called us to
[28:20] because we have all been placed into
[28:22] this body and because because as the
[28:24] scripture says as Paul was speaking here
[28:27] because we're not we're not all of the
[28:29] same group and we're not all called to
[28:31] the same thing well you know what it
[28:32] doesn't make any big eyes or little use
[28:34] but we're all important we're all
[28:36] important in the plan of God no matter
[28:38] where you've been called to you've got a
[28:40] job to do and whatever God has called
[28:43] you to all God wants from you all God
[28:45] requires of you is to be faithful that's
[28:48] all God wants is us to be faithful to
[28:50] what God has called us
[28:52] to if we can just be called and just be
[28:55] faithful to the God's calling
[28:58] and we can just realize who we
[29:02] are and this is from the this is from
[29:04] the message hear ye him and brother Bram
[29:06] says he said that's what's the matter
[29:08] with the church today the reason that we
[29:10] don't have great manifestations he said
[29:12] the great Church of the Living God in
[29:14] this last day should be far down the
[29:16] road with every Divine Get Set set in
[29:19] order a great beautiful
[29:21] church but he said we've been broke up
[29:23] with denominations isms a little fusses
[29:25] and everything
[29:28] he said till God can do can do no more
[29:30] with us until we come together and get
[29:32] our hearts right with God he said that's
[29:34] why our blessings are about to run
[29:38] out he said it's it's getting cold and
[29:40] cooling off it's because we've been
[29:42] indifferent toward God towards God his
[29:45] spirit and his
[29:48] word and so we see that that because
[29:51] brother Bam could see the changing
[29:53] because of what had taken place here in
[29:55] here in the in the the mo moving of isua
[29:58] Street and he wait you know 50 years was
[30:00] supposed to be the Jubilee and he could
[30:02] see in 50 years from the day of the isua
[30:05] street Falling he could see all of the
[30:07] changes that had taken place when they
[30:09] should have been so much further down
[30:10] the road from where they were when the
[30:12] when the Holy Ghost felled and the gifts
[30:14] of the Spirit were placed in the church
[30:16] and all these things when they seen the
[30:18] opening of the word had taken place and
[30:20] when brother Bron began to preach the
[30:22] word to them then all of a sudden he
[30:24] could see that they had fallen away from
[30:26] where they had originally came
[30:30] from how many times he he stood there
[30:32] and told him he said he said your your
[30:34] parents and your grandparents he said
[30:36] they wouldn't they wouldn't stand for
[30:39] this and he said y'all went why just
[30:41] like just like a dog right back to its
[30:43] vomit a hog right back to its wallow he
[30:46] said God delivered you from that and you
[30:48] went right back into
[30:51] it and how terrible it
[30:54] was but God sent a message in our our
[30:59] day that that he brought us out of
[31:03] that that we can stand and see because
[31:05] you know it it's up to us to take this
[31:08] message and carry it on it's it's us to
[31:11] to live this
[31:12] life but you know what it's it's not
[31:15] it's not me and myself doing it but it's
[31:17] being yielded to the holy spirit because
[31:20] if I if I am a child of God then I'm DW
[31:22] then he is dwelling inside of me then
[31:24] you know what the only thing that stops
[31:26] the Holy Spirit from moving is Aaron
[31:28] Roberts I I'm the greatest hindrance
[31:31] that I
[31:33] have but you know what the greatest
[31:35] asset that I have is me because you know
[31:38] what when I hear the word I can act on
[31:43] it because you know what that's what God
[31:46] called me to
[31:47] do God called me to live the
[31:50] life he wants me to take it take it and
[31:53] and live it and operate it right
[31:57] yeah it's like well we're just going to
[32:00] wait on brother Wade to do it we're
[32:02] going to wait on brother Bob we're going
[32:03] to wait on somebody no it's
[32:05] you God wants you to do
[32:09] it God wants me to do
[32:12] it brother bandam says he said the he
[32:15] said in in the message conflict between
[32:17] God and Satan he said the real true
[32:20] bride would be United by the word and
[32:24] that's where I got that's where I got
[32:25] this title from
[32:28] he said the true bride must be unified
[32:30] by the word he says if she is a part of
[32:33] Christ she has to be the word of Christ
[32:37] in order to be the word of Christ you
[32:40] have to be baptized into Christ and when
[32:42] you're in Christ you believe Christ and
[32:45] Christ is the
[32:47] word he said the bride must be unified
[32:50] unified together by the
[32:52] word see he was speaking of of Esther
[32:57] you know because Esther had Esther had a
[32:59] commission of what she was called to do
[33:03] you know what there was death in the
[33:06] land but you know what there was nobody
[33:08] else that was going to do that was able
[33:11] because when Mori give her the the word
[33:13] there was nobody else that was going to
[33:14] be able to fulfill that except for
[33:17] Esther death laid at the door and the
[33:21] only person that had access to the king
[33:23] that would be able to do anything about
[33:25] it was Esther
[33:27] right but what did she do she didn't go
[33:30] in there by herself she went up there
[33:32] and she told all the Jews she said pray
[33:36] and fast pray and fast with me why
[33:39] because I'm getting ready to do
[33:41] something that I'm facing
[33:43] death she was the one that had to do
[33:46] that but you know what she had people
[33:47] that was unified with her to go before
[33:49] the
[33:51] king there was something that she was
[33:53] called to
[33:55] do and it was like well the Jews didn't
[33:58] say well you know what it ain't no none
[34:00] of my no they were all under that curse
[34:03] they all face
[34:05] death because of the king's
[34:10] decree but you know every one of them
[34:12] they got together with
[34:14] her and we were praying and and seeking
[34:18] God when she went in
[34:22] there see it takes everybody working
[34:25] together
[34:28] see he was speaking of the Bride Ador
[34:30] adorning
[34:32] herself just like Esther did see she had
[34:34] to get ready she had to prepare herself
[34:36] and the bride has to do the same
[34:38] thing he said what has she got speaking
[34:41] of the Bride he said what has she got he
[34:43] said assembling together in The
[34:44] Fellowship of the word amen Fellowship
[34:47] of the word fellowshipping sitting
[34:50] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[34:52] Jesus he said tonight one Accord one
[34:56] place one Spirit one mind one hope one
[34:58] God one purpose amen see there you are
[35:01] every time the Bible says a anything we
[35:04] say Amen punctuating every word with
[35:10] amen see because they had to do just
[35:13] those Jews had the same had to get in
[35:15] the same channel that Esther got in
[35:17] because they had to get desperate that
[35:20] they realized what was going to take
[35:23] place and so she could walk in into that
[35:26] place into the into the king's
[35:28] chamber and all those people had been
[35:31] praying and
[35:34] fasting you know when it when it got to
[35:37] that point when it got real you know
[35:38] they wasn't always worried about what
[35:40] was going on in the news what the
[35:42] neighbors were doing what anybody else
[35:45] was doing why because it became
[35:47] important to them why because the the
[35:50] the seriousness of the of the time
[35:52] became became the most important thing
[35:55] to them when they realized where they
[35:57] were where they were
[35:59] at then all of a sudden they got they
[36:01] got to the place where they got serious
[36:03] with
[36:06] God and then they then they they began
[36:08] to pray well then Esther could go in on
[36:10] those
[36:11] prayers to be to be you know to to help
[36:16] you know because that that was that was
[36:18] a nerve-wracking thing that she had to
[36:19] do very
[36:22] nervous but see those prayers is what
[36:25] helped her go through that right she
[36:26] didn't go in there all by
[36:29] herself but she realized that the
[36:31] condition she was the one that could go
[36:33] in into the king's
[36:36] presence and and bring and bring that
[36:38] petition before
[36:41] them and brothers and sisters it's the
[36:43] same way with you and
[36:46] I sometimes sometimes we we think we
[36:48] think we're we're insignificant we miss
[36:51] we miss God's calling sometimes because
[36:53] we don't realize the position that we're
[36:56] in
[36:58] you know many many times brother
[36:59] brandham tell had told the story about
[37:01] about the sister and you know when the
[37:03] baby was was there and the and you know
[37:06] the the
[37:07] mother and you know she was standing
[37:09] there and and the Lord kept telling her
[37:10] to pray for that baby and you know she
[37:13] didn't want to do
[37:15] that because she thought she was
[37:17] insignificant to do that you know she
[37:20] began to question the calling of God and
[37:23] then when he when she saw that you know
[37:24] this this mother she's standing there
[37:26] she's got a prayer card like well I'm
[37:28] not going to pray for this baby cuz
[37:29] brother brandom's going to do it but you
[37:31] know what that burden laid on that
[37:33] mother because see that's what God told
[37:35] her to
[37:36] do and you know and then she then she
[37:39] tried to appease herself just by
[37:40] carrying the baby or letting the lady
[37:41] sit in her chair whatever but you know
[37:43] what God never got her away from that
[37:45] calling that was that was a desire that
[37:47] God had placed on her it was something
[37:49] that God had placed on her to do and you
[37:52] know what it didn't matter what she was
[37:53] like sister can I pray for your baby
[37:55] because I just can't I just just can't
[37:56] get away from
[37:58] this but what did Brother Brenham say
[38:00] when when he when when she came up into
[38:02] the prayer line with under discernment
[38:04] he's like that sister back there she
[38:05] prayed for the baby it's already
[38:09] healed and then when when he said that
[38:11] he said see see she was a mother she
[38:13] could enter in he said I might not been
[38:15] able to do that I'm not a mother but she
[38:17] was a mother she could do something but
[38:20] it also showed that that God was not a
[38:23] respector of persons because when when
[38:25] he had something to do there was
[38:27] something that he wanted that sister to
[38:30] do and so it was a it was a that's what
[38:32] God wants us to do he wants us to
[38:34] realize you know when God wants us to do
[38:36] then check it by the
[38:39] word but sometimes sometimes we're we're
[38:41] we're so in we think we're so
[38:43] insignificant to do something that God
[38:45] is trying to get us to do something it's
[38:47] like well you know it's somebody else's
[38:50] job you know and and if we if we spend
[38:53] all of our time dealing with how
[38:55] insignificant we are you know we never
[38:56] would get out of bed we never would do
[38:58] anything because all we could do is just
[39:00] living living a life of of our own
[39:02] insignificancy but thank God that God
[39:05] has called us to a place that you know
[39:06] what it's when we get to the place we
[39:08] realize that we are insignificant we are
[39:10] insufficient but God has made us to the
[39:13] place we are God has given us what what
[39:16] we have need of because if we've been
[39:18] birthed out of this old old life if we B
[39:21] out of this this flesh this old pest
[39:24] house and been born into the kingdom of
[39:26] God then guess what we're not God's not
[39:28] looking at your old flesh anymore but
[39:30] he's looking at you through the
[39:39] blood see if we can see who we
[39:42] are God wants us to see that you know
[39:45] because all all things that that you
[39:47] have need of he said it was given to you
[39:50] in the New
[39:53] Birth that if you had need of something
[39:55] that you've already you've already
[39:57] received it if you're if you're an heir
[39:59] of God and join heirs with
[40:02] Christ then if you if that's the
[40:04] position that you and I are in then
[40:05] praise God then we've got all the things
[40:07] that we have need of and it's at our
[40:10] it's readily at our
[40:14] disposal because if if if you if we're
[40:18] standing here today and we have and we
[40:19] have need if we're sick tonight then you
[40:22] know what he's already he's already took
[40:24] the stripes on his back and he's already
[40:26] completed it he said by his stripes we
[40:29] were healed so that that's a finished
[40:31] work then if you're standing if you're
[40:33] sitting here tonight then if you have a
[40:35] need in your body then guess what the
[40:36] healings already been completed it
[40:39] already lays there before you all you
[40:41] got to do is accept it all you got to do
[40:43] is claim it all you got to do is realize
[40:45] that tonight that he's a squatter the
[40:48] devil's a squatter on your property and
[40:50] all you got to do is cast him
[40:52] out
[40:54] right you don't have to stop you don't
[40:57] have to back up you don't have to
[40:58] apologize to the devil you don't have to
[41:01] apologize for who you
[41:05] are you know I was listening to a Jew
[41:07] one time and said well you know what it
[41:08] wasn't me that called me to be a Jew but
[41:11] you know because what God done for me
[41:12] that God done that I didn't have
[41:14] anything to do with it but I'm not going
[41:15] to back up I'm not going to apologize
[41:17] for who I
[41:19] am God's called us to be separate to be
[41:22] separate from the world to be to be
[41:24] completely or separate from the world I
[41:27] called out of the things of
[41:29] Darkness God has called us out of
[41:31] Darkness into this Marvelous Light well
[41:34] we don't have to apologize for what
[41:36] God's done for us we don't have to
[41:38] apologize for what God has showed
[41:40] us why because that we realize there's a
[41:43] special class of people that has been
[41:45] called to this it's not called to the
[41:47] whole wide world to see
[41:48] it but there's only a special group
[41:51] that's going to be able to see
[41:54] this see God has called us into this God
[41:58] God has a plan a purpose he has he has a
[42:01] way that he wants everything
[42:04] done you know we find a place in the
[42:06] scripture when we see a group in the in
[42:09] the Old Testament that came together and
[42:11] you know they had their own way of of
[42:13] coming together and and they wanted to
[42:14] have great things and and have great
[42:16] things take place and you know they all
[42:18] came together and they had their um the
[42:21] the all of the things together what what
[42:24] they wanted the purpose and all the
[42:25] things that they want wanted to have
[42:26] together and they got this great idea
[42:29] that they want to go out and build the
[42:30] Tower of Babel you know because
[42:32] everybody because the wickedness in the
[42:34] land had got so great and they all
[42:36] wanted to build a great tower to to
[42:39] their uh ideas and and their thoughts
[42:42] and how great they are and you know this
[42:44] is their great Monument to what their
[42:46] what their their achievements are in
[42:48] this world and everything we realized
[42:50] that that God allowed all this thing to
[42:52] take place and then he destroyed it and
[42:54] he uh separated all the different
[42:56] languages and everything like that and
[42:57] split all the people up why because when
[43:00] everybody came together and tried to do
[43:03] what God then God tore it all down and
[43:05] he separated it and he busted it all
[43:10] up and here's here's brother bandam
[43:12] speaking he says he said you see that as
[43:14] they they they traveled they come into
[43:16] this this Fair land he said and they
[43:19] United themselves as one people he said
[43:21] now that's all right but he said but
[43:24] they United under the wrong leaders ship
[43:27] he said they had United under the
[43:29] leadership of man he said and God wants
[43:31] man to unite under the leadership of
[43:33] himself he said he wants us to be one
[43:36] but he wants us to be one with uh but he
[43:40] wants to be one with us but man wants to
[43:43] wants his fellow man to be his leader
[43:45] and unite under the wisdom of his fellow
[43:50] man and he continues on see he said see
[43:52] how striking it is he said he said
[43:55] that's that's the reason that that he
[43:57] wants to be is because that God designed
[44:00] him for that purpose God designed man to
[44:04] be to unite together God designed man
[44:07] made him up to be one to work together
[44:10] to cooperate together he said that's the
[44:12] makeup of man that's the way God made
[44:14] him but man always wants to have his
[44:17] idea about it he said he wants to
[44:20] project something that God never
[44:22] intended him to do he wants to figure
[44:24] his own ways out he wants to make his
[44:26] own plans he said but he won't accept
[44:29] the plan that God made for him because
[44:32] it's his Fallen
[44:34] nature see God called a man and he's got
[44:38] a he's got a purpose and he's got a plan
[44:40] that he wants man to come through but
[44:42] you know everybody they get their own
[44:44] ideas on how things are and as they did
[44:46] when they tried to build the Tower of
[44:48] Babel they had this great plan of what
[44:50] was going to take place and what they
[44:51] could achieve and all these things that
[44:53] was going to take place and how great
[44:54] they are but the problem problem is it
[44:56] never amounted to anything but you know
[44:58] we see everybody there's so many people
[45:00] that have tried to come up with their
[45:02] own ideas and their own thoughts or how
[45:04] they were going to work things out and
[45:05] how things were going to come and you
[45:07] know they want to be so great but when
[45:10] God begins to speak to them and tell
[45:11] them exactly what it needs what you've
[45:13] got to do to come to the place to be
[45:15] great if you want to if you want to be
[45:17] like him if you want to be like Jesus
[45:19] Christ then what you've got to
[45:21] do many times people come to the place
[45:24] and realize it's too great of a
[45:25] sacrifice
[45:26] face because there was a you know the
[45:29] Rich Young Ruler that he came and had
[45:31] this great plan he come and recognize
[45:34] who Jesus was and he told him he said
[45:36] you know what Master what must I do to
[45:38] inherit eternal
[45:42] life see he realized he was
[45:45] insignificant what but when Jesus began
[45:48] to talk to him and Jesus loved him
[45:51] because he saw what kind of life that he
[45:53] that he lived what he's like you know
[45:54] I've done all these things since my
[45:56] youth look of all the all the things
[45:57] that I've done in my life I've kept the
[46:01] law all the things that I've been taught
[46:03] all these time but see when Jesus began
[46:07] to discern his life and come to the
[46:09] place and realize you know there's one
[46:10] thing that's holding you back there's
[46:12] one thing that's hindering you from
[46:14] coming to the place that you need to
[46:15] come to and he said it's your riches he
[46:18] said you need to get rid of everything
[46:19] sell everything give it all away just
[46:22] get rid of it why because it's such a
[46:24] hindrance to you and your life is
[46:26] holding you back from the place that you
[46:28] want to come to when Jesus standing
[46:31] there the word of life is standing there
[46:33] the son of man standing face to face
[46:35] with him began to speak to him and tell
[46:36] him exactly what he had need of what he
[46:39] needed to do and it was too great for
[46:41] him it was too much for him to give that
[46:44] up and he walked away sad
[46:47] sorrowful he had all that he had had
[46:50] need
[46:52] of and didn't realize the greatest thing
[46:56] was standing in front of him oh I've got
[46:58] great
[46:59] barns I got to tear down and build
[47:02] bigger I've got so
[47:05] much when he's sitting out there one day
[47:08] thinking you know what I can just take
[47:09] it easy now look at all the look at all
[47:11] the wealth I've accumulated I've got all
[47:13] this
[47:14] Prestige oh look at all the things that
[47:16] I have in this
[47:18] world and not realize he sold his own
[47:22] soul for bigger barns
[47:26] for
[47:27] wealth for a good name all the things
[47:30] that he sold his he sold out
[47:33] for but when it come to a time that he
[47:36] had to give an account for his life none
[47:38] of it mattered none of it was never
[47:40] accounted to
[47:43] anything brother Ram says here in in the
[47:45] Queen of
[47:46] Sheba see he's talking about the the
[47:49] people in in their lives and and the
[47:51] things that they go through he says what
[47:52] a disappointment it's going to be at the
[47:55] at the day is going to be at judgment he
[47:58] said when men who sought that they were
[48:00] all right because they had Faith to heal
[48:04] the sick because they had they had Faith
[48:07] to operate a gift they had great
[48:08] meetings great evangelist service and
[48:10] one
[48:11] Souls but see all the things that they
[48:14] had done and he says depart from me you
[48:16] workers of iniquity I've never I never
[48:18] knew you when they come through all
[48:21] these great things and done these great
[48:22] things and said Lord look what we've
[48:23] done all the great things that we've
[48:25] done
[48:26] and brother BR say see it takes more
[48:27] than power of gifts it takes more than
[48:29] just joining church he said it takes the
[48:32] birth of the Holy Spirit to break down
[48:34] our walls and to unite us together as
[48:37] one great Christian body moving for one
[48:39] objective and one goal see we have to be
[48:43] move beyond all these things see that's
[48:45] what God's purpose is for
[48:48] us for us to come
[48:51] together see you've got you've got to
[48:53] lay down all all of your your thoughts
[48:56] and ideas you've got to lay down
[48:59] everything and say Lord what do you have
[49:01] me look in the scripture to find out
[49:03] what God wants from you he said see
[49:05] that's that's the God's purpose we find
[49:08] here in sining the Holy Ghost was one
[49:09] purpose that God himself might dwell in
[49:12] his church and continue his plans
[49:14] through the church that God was in
[49:17] Christ continuing his plans through
[49:19] Christ out of Christ into the church
[49:22] continuing his work through the church
[49:25] so he continues his work through the
[49:27] church so what God had his in his mind
[49:30] he it's come to us to do that thing to
[49:33] to the plan of God for us to come
[49:35] understand what the purpose of God is
[49:36] for our lives and you know to see what
[49:39] God wants us to
[49:41] do you know to to and not see as as
[49:46] anything
[49:49] insignificant but if God's called us to
[49:54] this then you know what what is not
[49:57] insignificant what God has called us
[50:00] to you
[50:02] know what what God has laid before
[50:06] us see God has equipped us to the do
[50:10] these to what God wants us to
[50:13] do and you know if if we work to because
[50:16] we have to work
[50:17] together because you have to do your
[50:20] part and I do my part and it and it's
[50:22] all of us working together but but you
[50:25] know there's one thing that the one
[50:26] thing that you're going to find out and
[50:28] I know we all we all know it but you
[50:31] know anytime you you get in your mind
[50:33] that you're going to do something for
[50:34] God and God's called you to do something
[50:37] there there ain't no day that doesn't
[50:39] pass by that you know that the devil's
[50:41] not there to hinder everything that you
[50:42] try to do when you when you get when you
[50:45] get something God lays something on your
[50:47] heart and you just think you know I know
[50:50] this is the will of God for me and you
[50:52] just feel like this you're led to do
[50:54] something and there everything that
[50:56] comes against you and there's nothing
[50:57] that goes right and you think well why
[51:00] in the world is is that the way it is
[51:02] you know why is it that you know I was
[51:04] thinking about the message you know
[51:05] brother R preached the message
[51:07] recognizing your day and its message and
[51:09] you know brother Randon was talking
[51:10] about he kept trying to he felt like the
[51:11] Lord was trying to tell him something he
[51:13] kept trying to trying to get the mind of
[51:15] God and he said I kept trying to pray
[51:16] and he said you know he said I ate
[51:18] something that made me sick and he said
[51:19] I kept falling asleep and he said you
[51:21] know I kept driving and he said I kept
[51:23] trying to every time I kept trying to
[51:24] yield myself and trying to get to find
[51:27] out what the Lord was trying to tell me
[51:28] you know it was just like everything was
[51:29] just coming against him it just like you
[51:31] know but you know brother Bram never
[51:33] gave up on that every time that the
[51:35] thing kept going on he you know he just
[51:36] kept going and kept going he said you
[51:38] know he just kept yielding himself he
[51:39] just kept praying and he kept seeking
[51:41] God trying to get the and he said you
[51:43] know it was early in the morning you
[51:44] know he finally the Lord broke through
[51:46] you know come through and began to speak
[51:48] to him and tell him he said you know I
[51:49] just got this message to bring to you
[51:51] this morning so you know it's it
[51:54] whatever God has for you you you're
[51:55] going to find out the devil's going to
[51:57] hinder you he's going to try to hinder
[51:59] you and everything well praise God you
[52:01] know if if you realize it's the will of
[52:04] God for you to do something then you
[52:05] know when you just keep pressing on and
[52:07] don't give up you just keep pressing
[52:09] forward because you know if you because
[52:12] the devil's going to hinder you in every
[52:13] way shape form and fashion but praise
[52:16] God we've been given this
[52:18] contest because a contest is is a test
[52:21] of
[52:22] strength brother R said and say you got
[52:25] see the greatest contest there is but is
[52:27] between the church and Satan see you got
[52:29] to realize that he's coming he's he's a
[52:32] brother said he's the great strength the
[52:33] great strength of
[52:35] Satan but he said you know there's a
[52:38] great strength in the church
[52:41] too see we realize that see God has
[52:44] called us to this God has called us see
[52:47] the devil's going to try to hinder
[52:50] you but praise God that when when God
[52:52] try when the Satan's trying to hinder
[52:54] you God is still there and guess what
[52:57] you just got to keep pressing in you
[52:59] just got to keep pressing forward
[53:00] because if you keep fighting this battle
[53:02] then you're going to see that he's going
[53:03] to break through that God has something
[53:06] for you you know just like Daniel there
[53:08] waiting on 21 days praying you know
[53:11] because when when he you know the Lord
[53:13] tried to speak to him but you know he
[53:15] prayed and he was searching and looking
[53:17] for an answer but you know what God sent
[53:19] him an
[53:20] answer God had an answer for him but you
[53:23] know what he just kept waiting and
[53:24] waiting and waiting he didn't know when
[53:26] he was going to come but you know what
[53:28] God didn't give up on Daniel God already
[53:31] had his answer coming to Daniel but you
[53:34] know what you know but he said you know
[53:36] that Michael had to come and help him
[53:37] but you know Gabriel come and spoke to
[53:39] Daniel he said he said you know great
[53:42] you're greatly beloved of of God that
[53:44] that he wanted to talk to you and he had
[53:46] an answer for you Daniel and you know
[53:48] you know he thought about you coming and
[53:51] seeking God for an answer for these
[53:53] things that you saw in the word
[53:57] well you know what if you have an if you
[53:58] have a question in the word then he said
[54:00] that he would brother Ram said that he's
[54:02] obligated to put somebody behind the
[54:04] pull pit to give you an
[54:06] answer then you know what then if you've
[54:08] got if you've got an answer don't give
[54:09] up on on your
[54:11] questions you know I've had questions in
[54:13] my life that it takes years and years
[54:15] and years to get an
[54:17] answer there's things that that are not
[54:20] that are not clear you don't you just
[54:21] hold on to them and it's like well I
[54:22] don't understand this and I don't
[54:24] understand that
[54:26] but you know one of these days if you
[54:28] but if you never if you never get into
[54:30] the word just like Daniel you know he
[54:33] was he said he was studying by books and
[54:36] was reading what the prophets had to say
[54:38] reading Jeremiah and the different ones
[54:39] he when he began to read those things he
[54:41] began to see these things he began to
[54:43] pray about
[54:44] it and people you know they talk about
[54:47] well they don't they don't know uh I
[54:49] well I don't understand certain things
[54:50] it's like well have you ever read
[54:54] it
[54:55] you know you find you find people you
[54:57] know brother de and brother Wade they
[54:59] they definitely know you know you hear
[55:01] these people and they and you know they
[55:03] don't know the first thing about Daniel
[55:05] 70 weeks but some of them don't even own
[55:07] the Daniel 70 weeks
[55:10] book when you don't even own the book
[55:12] and you've never read it you've never
[55:13] listened to the tapes how in the word do
[55:15] you expect to ever understand anything
[55:17] if you've never got into the
[55:23] word you know if you don't if you don't
[55:25] ever begin to study these things and and
[55:28] read then all of a sudden you know
[55:30] people well you know I I've never I've
[55:32] never read
[55:34] that well how are you ever going to get
[55:38] anything it's like you know people
[55:40] expect how you know you go to school you
[55:43] know you they send you to school every
[55:45] day for 12 13 years whatever it is you
[55:48] never crack a book you never carry a
[55:49] pencil you never you never do anything
[55:51] and you wonder why you don't learn
[55:54] anything
[55:58] well you know if you just go and sit in
[56:00] the classroom and stare at the ceiling
[56:01] all day long you're not ever going to
[56:03] get
[56:04] anything well if you come to church and
[56:07] you're and you're so uninterested in
[56:09] what's going on that you're looking at
[56:10] the back of your
[56:12] eyelids you know and if and if if you're
[56:14] not interested that you ever go back and
[56:16] listen to what's being
[56:19] said when when when when when the
[56:22] brothers give us a tell you like brother
[56:25] Wade was saying you know uh what y'all
[56:27] to do now we're getting ready to get
[56:28] into the church ages youall to read the
[56:30] church age
[56:33] book well if nobody ever looks at the
[56:35] church age book if you never listen if
[56:38] you don't even listen to brother Brandon
[56:39] preach the church
[56:41] ages if you don't ever listen to any of
[56:43] it you never read the book you never
[56:45] listen when they when they you know you
[56:46] can actually hear the church age book
[56:49] written somebody actually read the book
[56:51] and you can actually listen to the tapes
[56:52] of it you don't even have to read read
[56:55] the book you can just listen to audio of
[56:57] it but if we never take the time to even
[57:00] look in the
[57:01] book if we never take the time to do
[57:04] that or when when brother Bob has told
[57:06] us listen go back and read this chapter
[57:09] you know if you never go back even skim
[57:11] the
[57:12] chapter if you never listen to the
[57:15] chapter well if you've never taken the
[57:17] time because you don't have the the
[57:19] desire that how do you expect to
[57:22] grow that how do you expect for anything
[57:24] to take
[57:26] Place well sometimes if things happen
[57:29] you know when they when they they
[57:31] they'll tell us things well you know
[57:33] what if if we if we take them and
[57:36] actually apply them in our life then
[57:37] things will happen you'll actually see
[57:39] because sometimes is that just brother
[57:41] Bob speaking or is that just brother
[57:43] Louise saying something or is that
[57:45] actually God speaking to us wanting us
[57:47] to take heed to what's being
[57:50] said then then if we can actually do
[57:53] that why because sometimes I just tell
[57:55] you the fact straight up sometimes I'm
[57:57] the one saying Lord I'm
[58:00] sorry because you know what they'll tell
[58:02] me something because I hear Brother Bob
[58:04] say something like that and then later
[58:05] on it's like you know what I didn't look
[58:06] at
[58:09] that and I you know I I apologize Lord I
[58:12] forgot
[58:16] sorry but Lord bring it back to my
[58:21] Rememberance because you know I you know
[58:24] I I I'm human I make mistakes I
[58:27] fail but you know what I I don't want to
[58:29] be like that I want to continue
[58:34] on see God has called us he he wants us
[58:37] to do these
[58:38] things see the Holy Spirit we yield
[58:41] ourselves of the Holy Spirit and let the
[58:43] Holy Spirit do a work in
[58:46] US brother BR said he said and in the
[58:48] message what is the Holy Ghost given for
[58:51] he's speaking of the Holy Ghost he said
[58:52] see it's it's to give unction to the
[58:54] preacher he said it's to give Holiness
[58:56] to the group it's to set the church in
[58:58] order he said it's to bring Unity of
[59:01] spirit it's to unite us together with
[59:04] power it's to unite us together with
[59:07] love brotherly love he said he said
[59:10] there's nothing present nothing Future
[59:12] No no hunger starvation nothing that can
[59:14] separate us from the love of God he said
[59:17] the love of Christ the love of God
[59:19] that's in Christ because we are born of
[59:20] his Spirit washed in his blood we are a
[59:23] new creature that's what God came to do
[59:26] that's what the holy spirit's for so
[59:29] that's what God has called us to do he's
[59:31] called us to this that that God wants us

[1:01:56] understand the fight is on and you can't
[1:01:58] give up God has called you to this fight
[1:02:00] and you got to realize that you know
[1:02:02] what you've got to do your part you got
[1:02:03] to fight you got to fight and be brave
[1:02:06] against all evil you can't give
[1:02:10] up now brother brandham continues on
[1:02:13] here and he was speaking of of of
[1:02:15] football and you know he he talks about
[1:02:17] he said you know he said the problem is
[1:02:18] is you got to realize that you got to
[1:02:20] work together it's all it's all a body
[1:02:22] Ministry and he said you know he said
[1:02:24] the problem is is people he said
[1:02:25] everybody wants to pack the ball and
[1:02:27] everybody wants to fight and he said the
[1:02:28] problem is they're fighting a man that's
[1:02:30] trying to carry the
[1:02:36] ball he said he said no wonder we don't
[1:02:40] get anywhere he said everybody's wanting
[1:02:41] to pack the ball he said when a correct
[1:02:44] football game is going on they'll pass
[1:02:46] the ball to their best
[1:02:49] man he said all together we are in this
[1:02:52] great F fight of life he he said we
[1:02:54] ought to be we ought to stand behind our
[1:02:56] pastor stand behind our Brethren with
[1:02:59] all that we got within us say we got to
[1:03:02] all SP and we got to all do what what
[1:03:04] God has called us he said see what do
[1:03:06] you think the holy spirit says in the
[1:03:08] presence of God he said there is not no
[1:03:12] division in the Church of the Living God
[1:03:15] see when you realize who you are you've
[1:03:16] got to get to the place that God's
[1:03:18] called you to and do the part that
[1:03:20] you've got to do the brother Bram
[1:03:21] continues on here he said when when they
[1:03:23] run the
[1:03:25] he talks about he talks about there's
[1:03:27] two positions that he that he really
[1:03:28] talks
[1:03:30] about he said you know he said the one
[1:03:33] of the problems he said the thing is we
[1:03:35] want to do is not take the ball out of
[1:03:37] the man that's got the ball that's
[1:03:38] running
[1:03:39] it we don't want to take the ball away
[1:03:41] from him now he continues on there and
[1:03:43] he talks about there's two positions
[1:03:45] that we ought to have that he talks
[1:03:46] about in football the first one he talks
[1:03:48] about is is being a
[1:03:50] tackle when I played football I played
[1:03:53] tackle
[1:03:56] I know that surprised some of you but I
[1:03:58] played tackle I know what tackles
[1:04:01] do but you know you know when you when
[1:04:04] you play tackle and brother B also
[1:04:06] talked about playing a guard when you
[1:04:09] play tackle the one the first thing you
[1:04:12] got to do you don't look at what
[1:04:13] everybody else is doing the first thing
[1:04:16] a tackle's got to do is he's got to line
[1:04:18] up and see who he's supposed to be
[1:04:19] blocking he's got to know what the
[1:04:21] defense is trying to do because the
[1:04:23] defense is to hinder you you got to know
[1:04:26] what everybody you got to see where
[1:04:27] everybody's lining up the first thing
[1:04:29] you got to do is realize that when they
[1:04:31] line up on the other side of the ball
[1:04:33] what they're going to try to do is try
[1:04:35] to deceive
[1:04:37] you they're going to try to come in
[1:04:39] there and they'll bring people down and
[1:04:41] you think they're going to rush when
[1:04:42] they're not because as soon as they come
[1:04:44] down they'll run back they'll drop back
[1:04:46] in coverage I know some of y'all May
[1:04:48] don't understand that but some of you
[1:04:51] will Google
[1:04:53] it
[1:04:55] but what what happens is the first thing
[1:04:56] you got to do you got to know who your
[1:04:58] man
[1:05:00] is the first time I played in ninth
[1:05:02] grade first time I ever played in a
[1:05:04] football game in my life organized
[1:05:07] football I blocked the wrong man they
[1:05:10] sacked our
[1:05:15] quarterback you know what I was I was
[1:05:18] nervous I was I was you know I was all
[1:05:21] excited I was
[1:05:23] jittery
[1:05:25] but you know what after after I had
[1:05:27] screwed up and I went back in the Huddle
[1:05:28] you know the first thing they didn't do
[1:05:30] what are you
[1:05:31] doing you know what they just lined back
[1:05:34] up hey we gonna get them this
[1:05:38] time they didn't they didn't chew me
[1:05:42] out they encouraged me you know why
[1:05:46] because the guys that some of the guys
[1:05:48] on the football team they' been playing
[1:05:49] a long time I
[1:05:51] hadn't but you know what they got in
[1:05:53] there you know what it's like listen and
[1:05:56] then you I had somebody tell me one time
[1:05:57] it's like do you know you're supposed to
[1:06:01] block yeah I think I know who I'm
[1:06:03] supposed to
[1:06:05] block but you know what it takes
[1:06:09] time why because everybody but you've
[1:06:11] got to know what your position is you
[1:06:14] know I didn't look at what the
[1:06:15] quarterback's doing I don't look about
[1:06:17] what anybody else is doing I got to know
[1:06:19] where I'm at on the field I got to know
[1:06:20] what my job is and I got to recognize
[1:06:23] what's going on
[1:06:24] for my
[1:06:26] position because if I spent all my time
[1:06:29] if they got ready to snap the ball and
[1:06:31] I'm looking at somebody else and trying
[1:06:32] to figure out what everybody else is
[1:06:34] doing I'm no good I'm not I'm not
[1:06:38] effective I'm not doing
[1:06:41] anything so many times she was like well
[1:06:43] what do you think about this what do you
[1:06:44] think about that everybody's got their
[1:06:45] eye on everybody
[1:06:47] else it's like well let me ask you a
[1:06:49] question before you start asking what
[1:06:51] everybody else is thinking and doing and
[1:06:52] everything he's like have you prayed
[1:06:54] about
[1:06:57] it you know they used to sing this song
[1:07:00] many years ago and it was like uh you
[1:07:03] know if you see me doing something
[1:07:05] wrong it says then you go and tell Jesus
[1:07:07] on Me That Man From
[1:07:09] Galilee said don't tell another not a
[1:07:12] sister or a brother but go and tell
[1:07:13] Jesus on
[1:07:16] me you know if you see me something
[1:07:18] doing something wrong the first thing
[1:07:19] youall do is go tell Jesus about
[1:07:22] it
[1:07:25] well you know what oh did you see that
[1:07:27] well you know what if you do that on the
[1:07:28] football field you know what you're not
[1:07:31] effective then what are what what are
[1:07:33] the tackles to do they're on the end of
[1:07:36] then you're looking for somebody that's
[1:07:37] coming you got a
[1:07:39] block and you got to know how to
[1:07:42] block and your
[1:07:45] guards the next two men the on the other
[1:07:48] inside of the line on the other sides of
[1:07:51] the tackles are your guards that's
[1:07:53] exactly what they they've got to
[1:07:55] do brother Bram said we got to use our
[1:07:57] influence as
[1:07:59] tackles we've got to
[1:08:01] block we've got to support those that
[1:08:03] are running he said because the tackles
[1:08:05] that protect the runners he said we
[1:08:08] should be
[1:08:10] tackles he said be a guard guard the
[1:08:15] ball he said the holy spirit is trying
[1:08:18] to pack
[1:08:19] it see he said it'll condemn sin it'll
[1:08:22] condemn unrighteousness
[1:08:24] he said it'll manifest and glorify Jesus
[1:08:27] Christ he said it'll bring his person
[1:08:30] into the midst of the
[1:08:32] people see if you can if you can be the
[1:08:36] position that you need to
[1:08:38] be you guard those
[1:08:40] people well how well how do we protect
[1:08:43] each
[1:08:44] other by
[1:08:49] prayer when you pray and you're here in
[1:08:53] church when you're in fellowship with
[1:08:54] your brothers and
[1:08:55] sisters because you know what you gather
[1:08:58] strength from one
[1:09:00] another then he said that's the reason
[1:09:01] he said forsake not the assembling of
[1:09:03] yourselves together then we pray for one
[1:09:07] another because you know you've got to
[1:09:09] pray and I've got to pray for
[1:09:11] you to strengthen each
[1:09:15] other see he said guard guard your man
[1:09:18] guard protect the
[1:09:20] ball see that's what God wants us to do
[1:09:26] see guard them those that have that are
[1:09:28] going to run the
[1:09:30] wall he said he said see keep the rest
[1:09:33] of them so they can run keep guarding
[1:09:35] them and he said we'll have a touchdown
[1:09:37] after a while and Jesus will come and
[1:09:40] then it will all be
[1:09:41] over see God has called us to do these
[1:09:46] things how do you how do you
[1:09:50] protect one thing is Hebrews 13:7 1 says
[1:09:54] obey them that have the rule over you
[1:09:56] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[1:09:58] your
[1:09:59] souls that's what God wants us to
[1:10:02] do if you want if you want to be
[1:10:04] effective in the plan of God then know
[1:10:08] what your what your position is to
[1:10:10] submit yourselves obey what God has for
[1:10:13] us to
[1:10:15] do and then he
[1:10:18] says Hebrews 121 says wherefore sin we
[1:10:22] are so passed about with so greater
[1:10:24] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:10:26] every weight in the Sin which does so
[1:10:27] easily beset us and let us run with
[1:10:30] patience the race that is set before us
[1:10:33] see we're all called to do these
[1:10:36] things God's given us a job but I want
[1:10:39] you to know one
[1:10:42] thing God wants us to be guards tackles
[1:10:47] but you know what you have a time you've
[1:10:50] got to run the ball we've all got to run
[1:10:53] the ball
[1:10:55] in your life your daily life as you go
[1:10:57] through life just like brother B talking
[1:11:00] about a young man a man going to work
[1:11:02] with a lunch P under his
[1:11:05] arm that's Jesus Christ to the
[1:11:09] world a woman doing her wash washing
[1:11:12] clothes going about her daily duties see
[1:11:15] that's where God's going to say you've
[1:11:17] got to carry the word you've got to be
[1:11:18] the light to the
[1:11:20] world see there's times where you can't
[1:11:22] carry the ball
[1:11:25] we're protecting the
[1:11:27] others but you know we're supposed to
[1:11:29] protect you when you carry the
[1:11:32] gospel you know it's not brother R said
[1:11:35] I'd rather you live me a sermon than
[1:11:37] preach me
[1:11:39] one see it's not just about preaching it
[1:11:42] but it's all of us coming
[1:11:45] together brother Bram says here in the
[1:11:47] angel of the Covenant he said we all
[1:11:48] have to work together as one unit he
[1:11:51] said we have to get our differences away
[1:11:53] and lay aside doctrines and things and
[1:11:55] put our arms together and press forward
[1:11:57] and take the promise that almighty God
[1:12:00] has given
[1:12:01] us he says he says Unity is not an
[1:12:04] isolated thing Brethren Unity is for the
[1:12:07] whole body of
[1:12:09] Christ you know there's so many times
[1:12:11] that people have have taken things and
[1:12:13] you know and things have happened and
[1:12:16] instead of and instead of trying to draw
[1:12:19] people in you know brother brother they
[1:12:21] told Brother Brandon's like well you
[1:12:23] know what're going to draw you outside
[1:12:24] our
[1:12:25] Circle and brother BR said well that's
[1:12:27] all right you can draw me out I'm going
[1:12:29] to draw my circle bigger and draw you
[1:12:30] back
[1:12:35] in you know what brother BR just because
[1:12:37] brother brandham disagreed with people
[1:12:38] you know what it didn't stop him from
[1:12:39] loving
[1:12:41] people it didn't stop brother Brandon
[1:12:43] from calling him their brother right he
[1:12:47] didn't compromise on the word with
[1:12:49] people but you know what he showed them
[1:12:51] the love of
[1:12:52] God
[1:12:54] and sometimes people you know they don't
[1:12:55] want they don't want to have anything to
[1:12:56] do with
[1:12:57] anybody but you know there's no way to
[1:12:59] show the love of God that
[1:13:03] way I was listening to somebody the
[1:13:06] other day and he's a he's a a
[1:13:08] denominational preacher and you know you
[1:13:12] know he was standing up and he was and
[1:13:13] he was talking about the that there
[1:13:16] there's so much stuff that goes on in
[1:13:18] the world today and you know there there
[1:13:20] all these celebrities and and different
[1:13:22] things like that well you know he just
[1:13:23] stands up and tells them listen this is
[1:13:25] what I believe and I believe that's
[1:13:27] wrong but you know he's not he's not
[1:13:29] against people but he's going but he
[1:13:32] wanted the world to
[1:13:34] know that the world is is full and he's
[1:13:37] like people you know just like the the
[1:13:40] Methodist Church and and different ones
[1:13:42] everybody wants to come up with their uh
[1:13:44] a a better understanding of the
[1:13:48] scripture and he stood up and said well
[1:13:50] you know what you can try to come up
[1:13:51] with a better understanding of the
[1:13:53] script
[1:13:53] rure but he said he said but two men
[1:13:57] living together and two women living
[1:13:59] together he said that's incompatible
[1:14:02] with the
[1:14:03] scripture he said you'll never he said
[1:14:05] you'll never bring that together he said
[1:14:08] he said there's no place in the
[1:14:09] scripture where that'll that
[1:14:13] stands but he said listen he said you
[1:14:15] know you people are trying to come up
[1:14:16] with you know trying to understand and
[1:14:19] love people if you want to love people
[1:14:22] you show them what the word
[1:14:25] says that's all that's the love of God
[1:14:28] it's the word of
[1:14:29] God and you know what and people are not
[1:14:31] going to accept it they didn't accept it
[1:14:33] in Jesus's
[1:14:35] day and if they don't accept it well you
[1:14:37] can't help that but you can still love
[1:14:39] them and show them what's
[1:14:41] trueu and you know they were he was
[1:14:43] talking about some some man had went to
[1:14:46] went to
[1:14:47] some he said he was speaking for the
[1:14:50] black
[1:14:51] church and know this man's was a black
[1:14:54] Minister and and he and he told him he
[1:14:55] said listen he said you don't speak for
[1:15:00] me he thought he said well you know
[1:15:02] there's so many people in the in the in
[1:15:04] the black
[1:15:07] church that that live that lifestyle and
[1:15:09] he's like listen he they were
[1:15:11] apologizing for the way they've been
[1:15:12] treated he said you don't speak for
[1:15:16] me and I I thought I thought it was
[1:15:18] really good because he began to speak
[1:15:19] but you know what he's he he wants
[1:15:22] people to see what the truth is and the
[1:15:24] only way that you're going to show the
[1:15:25] love of God is through the word you know
[1:15:27] what you can't compromise on the
[1:15:31] word because you know what if if you
[1:15:33] just if you just let people just go and
[1:15:35] do whatever they want to
[1:15:37] do then you know then you're doing a
[1:15:39] disservice to them because if you don't
[1:15:42] answer because if you've been called of
[1:15:44] God to give an answer to the people to
[1:15:46] explain them what the scripture says
[1:15:48] then on the day of judgment you'll
[1:15:50] answer for
[1:15:51] that but you got to tell tell the people
[1:15:53] what the truth is to let them know
[1:15:56] listen this is what God's called us to
[1:15:58] this is what truth
[1:16:01] is you know because God God wants us to
[1:16:05] know what the scripture
[1:16:07] says and you
[1:16:09] know God called us to this
[1:16:13] message and when he called when he
[1:16:15] called us to this truth people well you
[1:16:17] know brother Brandon was wrong here
[1:16:18] brother Brandon was wrong
[1:16:20] there but you know there's a lot of
[1:16:21] things that people don't you know when
[1:16:23] you began to look you tell me what
[1:16:24] brother brandham brought out of the
[1:16:26] scripture that was
[1:16:29] wrong let's let's look into the
[1:16:32] scripture and let's start bringing
[1:16:33] things out of out of the scripture that
[1:16:35] brother brandham
[1:16:36] said when you begin to start to look at
[1:16:39] in the things that came out of the
[1:16:40] scripture tell me tell me where when he
[1:16:42] preached the future home you tell me
[1:16:44] where what what he brought out of the
[1:16:45] scripture that was something that nobody
[1:16:47] understood nobody El saw those things
[1:16:50] tell me tell me where brother Brandon
[1:16:52] was wrong when he preached the 70 weeks
[1:16:53] of
[1:16:54] Daniel you show you show me when he
[1:16:56] started to preach the seals the things
[1:16:58] that he brought out you show me the
[1:17:00] things that's not in the
[1:17:03] scripture no they want to take things
[1:17:06] that that you know well how many people
[1:17:08] fell off the bridge and and this or
[1:17:11] that no show me where where he didn't
[1:17:13] preach the
[1:17:16] word you know what there was three
[1:17:18] things that he said that the scripture
[1:17:20] talks about there's three things you
[1:17:21] man's got to watch out for for money
[1:17:24] women and popularity you show me where
[1:17:25] brother brandham failed on
[1:17:28] that you show me where brother brandham
[1:17:30] didn't stand up and live the life that
[1:17:33] that when when the men that stood around
[1:17:36] him they disagreed with brother Brandon
[1:17:37] but they stood up and they and they
[1:17:39] began to preach and said we saw Jesus
[1:17:41] Christ walk in our
[1:17:45] day then all of a sudden when when
[1:17:47] brother banham's gone then they're like
[1:17:49] oh well you
[1:17:51] know we we we we want to argue about
[1:17:55] things I told myself I I don't I don't
[1:17:57] under I don't I don't put a lot of stock
[1:17:59] in a lot of
[1:18:01] that because you know I had a friend of
[1:18:04] mine when I was in school his name was
[1:18:06] Jimmy and and Jimmy wasn't that big he
[1:18:08] was kind of a small and he slim guy but
[1:18:10] he always liked to get around me when he
[1:18:12] when he wanted to like he wanted to show
[1:18:14] off to people just in a comical way but
[1:18:16] you know he' always come up to me and
[1:18:18] you know he'd always pull his my arm up
[1:18:20] in front of him like this and he he'd
[1:18:22] hold his arm my arm on his chest and he
[1:18:25] would stand in front of people and say
[1:18:26] you better be glad he's holding me
