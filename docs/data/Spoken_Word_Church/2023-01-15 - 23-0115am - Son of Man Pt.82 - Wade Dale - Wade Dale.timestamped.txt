[4:49] things and what goes on there stays
[4:51] there
[4:53] somebody said
[4:55] thank you
[4:56] so I'll remember that also we got a
[4:58] wedding on March 24th I'll get these in
[5:01] here in a minute
[5:02] downstairs there's a thing you can look
[5:05] at you know and go online and do kind of

[5:17] 10th so says the bride to be
[5:20] February the 10th all right and it will
[5:23] be in Beaufort South Carolina about a
[5:24] four hour drive from here so just keep
[5:26] that in mind if you want to go all right
[5:29] remember Sister June this morning she's
[5:32] doing better yesterday was her third day
[5:33] and it was a little rough but she's made
[5:35] it through and the pain is just very
[5:38] minimal and she's doing well so we
[5:41] appreciate the prayers and all the cards
[5:43] and the letters and the teddy bears
[5:46] and all those things we appreciate that
[5:49] sister June loves you all and y'all love
[5:51] her I know amen that's why brother Brown
[5:53] said please love my family it doesn't
[5:54] matter if you love me love my family all
[5:56] right
[5:57] also remember we're gonna when we pray
[5:59] we'll need to pray for sister Freda she
[6:01] can't breathe very well this morning she
[6:03] just called in so let's just remember
[6:05] that in prayer and I want to tell you
[6:07] something a little comical my talking
[6:09] about brother John was talking about you
[6:10] know saving all that money you know and
[6:12] I I used to buy a lot of stuff from Bass
[6:15] Pro Shop but I was telling a friend of
[6:17] mine I said man he was an older
[6:19] gentleman and I said man I said John I
[6:22] said I said they were giving us 20
[6:24] percent I said I spent a hundred dollars
[6:26] and and they give me 20 back or you know
[6:29] I I saved 20 he said no son he said you
[6:32] spent 80.
[6:34] and that's what they wanted you to do
[6:37] so don't don't get it wrong that you're
[6:38] saving 20 no you're spending 80. all
[6:42] right so so keep that in mind when they
[6:44] give you a discount
[6:46] listen those people don't make money and
[6:48] have them big towers and big buildings
[6:50] and big salaries by giving you all their
[6:52] money
[6:53] they still make it only 80 so let's that
[6:56] you know like Walmart's not gonna go out
[6:58] of business if they give you 50 off okay
[7:00] so just remember that and also well
[7:03] sister Gwen remember her and the family
[7:05] there went and saw the family last night
[7:07] at the hospital uh Kip the one we've
[7:10] been praying for let's just keep him in
[7:12] Praise the Lord raise him up out of that
[7:13] and they've got a decision they need to
[7:15] make tomorrow so we're going to pray
[7:17] that the Lord will help them
[7:19] to make the right decision and uh I pray
[7:23] that his soul gets saved that that's
[7:26] more than anything more than anything is
[7:29] pray for salvation
[7:31] of his soul so let's remember all these
[7:33] things in our prayer remember Sister
[7:35] Freda and let's just go to the Lord in
[7:38] prayer remember Bob and Louise they've
[7:39] got a lot of work to do so we're praying
[7:41] for them so let's bow our hands Lord

[7:45] give us
[7:46] father we stand here Lord
[7:48] with the cream of the crop

[8:52] praying Lord if we see something that
[8:54] will help our youth Lord to know that
[8:56] that what a privileged place we do get
[8:58] to live in America and Lord at the
[9:01] things that we have that we take for
[9:02] granted I pray Lord that we'll not take

[9:08] have here in a good air conditioner and
[9:10] heated building with lights and and
[9:12] restrooms inside the building Lord we've

[9:57] spirit Lord that they bring with them
[9:59] Father we pray now that you're being
[10:00] with us in the furthermore this service
[10:02] in Jesus name we pray
[10:04] amen we're still on who is this son of
[10:07] man this would be part 83 and we're
[10:10] going to talk a little bit about
[10:12] uh we're going to insert adoption just
[10:16] for a moment because when we start up
[10:17] this statue of perfect man you've got to
[10:19] be able to talk about adoption because
[10:21] that's what it is
[10:23] growth development
[10:25] that's what the statue of perfect man is
[10:28] adoption that's growth development
[10:30] that's what it is all right so make it
[10:32] real simple I want to read you a quote
[10:33] real quick brother round said try and do
[10:35] God a service I was thinking about this
[10:36] morning we were talking about this me
[10:38] and somebody the other day said watch
[10:39] how close it gets to that Razor Edge
[10:41] between right and wrong remember it'll
[10:43] fall on one side or the other
[10:46] you better get off the fence
[10:49] because that's the sharp edge you better
[10:51] get off the fence
[10:53] amen because you're going to go one way
[10:56] or the other
[10:57] it's a honed razor between the
[11:00] difference of right and wrong it's got
[11:02] to be every word of God not just almost
[11:06] every word
[11:08] not just almost every word
[11:11] but every word and it's got down today
[11:13] not lutherans not Methodist not
[11:15] Pentecostal but to the home days in this
[11:18] age where the Antichrist anointing is so
[11:20] perfect it would seem to deceive the
[11:22] very leg amen so let's come back to the
[11:24] razor's Edge and get on the right side
[11:26] okay
[11:27] let's read in the beginning was the word
[11:29] the word was with God and the Word was
[11:31] God and the Word was made flesh and
[11:34] dwelt Among Us that's not two thousand
[11:36] years ago that's today
[11:38] and if you're born again today you are
[11:40] the word made flesh you know the second
[11:42] person of a trinity you're not the third
[11:44] person of a trinity
[11:47] your God
[11:49] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[11:51] among us and we beheld his glory of the
[11:52] glory the only begotten of the father
[11:54] full of grace
[11:55] and truth and we're going to talk a
[11:57] little bit we're going to get through
[11:58] virtue and into knowledge maybe the Lord
[12:00] within this afternoon we touched on a
[12:02] little bit the other day but there is a
[12:04] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and
[12:05] then there's a tree of life all right so
[12:07] there's two different types of knowledge
[12:09] it's okay to have worldly knowledge to
[12:12] live in the world and do your math and
[12:13] do your science and do your social
[12:15] studies and all that but that's all
[12:17] contrary to the word of God and that's
[12:19] the knowledge that we're looking for now
[12:21] because history can tell you their slant
[12:24] this is not a slant
[12:26] this is what happened and this is what's
[12:29] going to happen all right so it's our
[12:31] absolute is the Bible amen so out of the
[12:33] ground may the Lord God to grow every
[12:35] tree that's Pleasant to the site and
[12:36] good for food
[12:38] then it stops that's talking about trees
[12:40] with roots
[12:41] right these two next trees don't have
[12:43] Roots except feet
[12:47] that's what he's talking about now he
[12:48] says stop right here see that little
[12:49] thing says stop
[12:51] the tree of life also in the midst of
[12:53] the garden
[12:54] and the tree of knowledge I'm going to
[12:56] even look where it places the Tree of
[12:58] Life
[13:00] in the midst or in the middle of the
[13:03] garden
[13:05] we're going to look at it just demand a
[13:06] chart this is where God the tree of life
[13:08] is in your soul
[13:11] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[13:12] can work all the way around that but if
[13:14] you're born again today that tree of
[13:16] knowledge of Good and Evil will not
[13:17] enter in your soul if you're born again
[13:19] if you're not born again you are that
[13:22] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[13:26] I know that hurts your feelings but I'm
[13:28] sorry it's time to tell the truth you're
[13:30] either born again or you're not that's
[13:32] just the way it is you may be seated
[13:34] Lord has blessing to the reason his word
[13:37] Isaiah 28 verse 9 says look who shall
[13:40] teach knowledge
[13:41] and Whom Shall he make to understand
[13:43] Doctrine who them that are weaned from
[13:46] the milk and drawn
[13:48] from the breast in other words
[13:50] I had a little bitty glass of milk this
[13:52] morning I had it with my gravy and
[13:55] biscuit but I'm not going to have a
[13:57] glass of milk today with my hot dog
[13:59] that my son so graciously brought today
[14:01] don't let don't talk about hot dogs just
[14:04] leave it alone it's round steak just
[14:06] like bologna round steak
[14:08] don't tell me where it come from all
[14:10] right because I know where it came from
[14:13] I'm not gonna have any milk with that
[14:15] I'm gonna have something else because
[14:17] I'm going to eat meat and that's what we
[14:19] need to be we need to God's not going to
[14:21] come back and get a group of people that
[14:24] are novices he's not going to get a
[14:25] group of people that are babies remember
[14:27] I'm going to read your scripture in just
[14:29] a few minutes we've been reading before
[14:30] in Revelations 19 it says his wife
[14:33] has made herself ready I mean we become
[14:36] a bride we're sure you have a bride and
[14:38] you get married and you do things but
[14:40] man when it comes to like June and I'll
[14:42] be 44 years coming up in in October this
[14:45] year and and you know it's kind of scary
[14:47] but and it is true we kind of think
[14:48] alike a little bit y'all think June yeah
[14:51] June thinks like me sometimes
[14:53] that's on tape
[14:57] it's scary for some of you but she does
[15:00] and then I think like her and because
[15:03] why because we've been together so long
[15:04] we've been connected together so long so
[15:07] what about with the word of God though
[15:08] because we're two separate people with
[15:09] two separate ideas could be but with God
[15:12] there's not two ideas there's just one
[15:15] idea and man that's God's idea and that
[15:17] one works every time so we just need to
[15:19] be what part of that don't have in the
[15:21] mind of Christ as we've been talking
[15:23] about and that's what all this is going
[15:25] to be is we're going to hone it down to
[15:26] having the mind of Christ we'll skip
[15:29] this uh this one right here let's go uh
[15:31] pull the chart up please and we'll look
[15:33] at the chart we've been working on
[15:35] and for those of you that's not seen
[15:37] this chart it's a chart that brother uh
[15:39] I think brother Joe got it from
[15:41] somewhere but it's a chart that uh make
[15:43] it a little bit bigger please
[15:45] there you go thank you Abby let's give
[15:47] Abby a hand back there
[15:53] and
[15:55] Mercy
[15:56] that's the only two back there right
[15:58] man goodness gracious
[16:01] two girls
[16:04] that'll tell you guys something
[16:08] so this is what we're talking about this
[16:10] is the real you this is your soul
[16:12] this is only Faith or doubt there is no
[16:16] in between there is no special something
[16:18] I'm sorry I know there's doctrines in
[16:20] the message said you had this little got
[16:22] this little seed laying here well
[16:23] brother Brown said to see the faith or
[16:25] doubt they both can't be in there at the
[16:26] same time
[16:28] faith is God doubt is the devil all
[16:31] right so God is not in your soul when
[16:33] you're born I am so sorry to tell you
[16:35] that
[16:38] oh I got quotes well you know what
[16:40] brother Brown said I read you one the
[16:41] other day for brother Brown said I was
[16:42] born a kookaburra
[16:44] and then a wheat germ was put inside of
[16:47] me okay so it's just it's terminologies
[16:50] a lot of times that we get to I just
[16:52] know one thing's for sure what I did in
[16:54] my life before I was born again God was
[16:57] nowhere to be seen inside of me
[16:59] or I wouldn't have done what I did
[17:01] so let's just keep it at that let's look
[17:03] at good old-fashioned salvation
[17:05] all right I was born in sin shaping
[17:08] iniquity especially my mother's womb
[17:09] born a liar and brother Brown said
[17:11] doomed and on your way to hell how you
[17:12] going to be in hell if you got faith
[17:15] all right so God gives us the new birth
[17:18] listen a woman doesn't come here with
[17:21] seed
[17:24] she has to be given seed
[17:26] all right the seed word of God God don't
[17:29] have seed like we do like sperm
[17:32] the word is the seed
[17:35] so inside the word somewhere what did we
[17:37] have faith in
[17:39] James Dobson
[17:40] Walmart
[17:42] we have faith in what the word
[17:45] the seed of life is the word of God but
[17:48] anyway down in our soul is Faith or
[17:50] doubt one of the two and we got to
[17:52] understand I was thinking about this
[17:53] yesterday
[17:54] now brother Brown talks about he says
[17:56] about uh you know you could be born
[17:58] again and and you know how not have a
[18:01] real emotion but it will be an
[18:03] experience all right I just believe one
[18:06] thing's for sure brother John if I was
[18:08] over in another dimension the day I got
[18:10] born again there was a lot of screaming
[18:13] demons
[18:15] trying to claw their way back into my
[18:17] soul
[18:18] I'm just
[18:21] I'm just honest
[18:22] because that's where the unclean Spirit
[18:24] comes out
[18:26] that unclean spirit is in your soul it's
[18:29] attached to your nature
[18:32] because you're born in what a damn it
[18:35] world of damn it nature you were born
[18:38] with doubt
[18:40] then we come to the realization that
[18:42] we're lost
[18:44] I needed something I needed a change
[18:47] all right so what happened inside of
[18:50] here the unclean Spirit goes out of the
[18:52] man walks in dry places seek his wrath
[18:55] findeth none comes back and see a little
[18:58] hole right there comes back in and finds
[19:01] the house swept in garnished or
[19:03] sanctified
[19:05] you're coming to church you're reading
[19:07] your Bible you're doing the things of
[19:08] God you're not going to The Honky tones
[19:10] you're not going you're not you know
[19:11] doing the things that you used to do
[19:13] before you're you're what you're trying
[19:15] you're filling this up with with the
[19:17] Holy Spirit not the spirit you had
[19:19] before everybody with me say Amen all
[19:22] right so what you got to do is is you
[19:24] got to cap that thing off God will seal
[19:27] you in
[19:28] and he can't get out the devil can't get
[19:31] in
[19:32] I say that God said he can't get out
[19:35] God's not going to give you the Holy
[19:36] Ghost right here and then pull it back
[19:38] away from you we'll read here in just a
[19:40] minute on adoption you got to learn that
[19:42] when we're when we're born again it puts
[19:45] us in the family of God we are a son and
[19:48] daughter of God all right
[19:50] with faith in the word of God then we
[19:53] have to come to adoption or growth
[19:55] period to where we can all these listen
[19:57] we're born with memories and conscious
[19:59] affection imagination but guess what
[20:01] that was all used for the devil at one
[20:04] period in time right
[20:06] so now if we're born again in our soul
[20:08] our soul doesn't need redeeming
[20:12] it's already redeemed
[20:13] everybody with me
[20:15] this part is what we need redeemed
[20:18] remember don't worry about the body
[20:23] I don't care you can be born again for
[20:25] 80 years if the Lord tears your body's
[20:27] gonna die
[20:29] because the curse but this is not sin
[20:33] it's under the same curse but this
[20:36] doesn't make you sin
[20:38] it is sin
[20:40] but inside of us what to while we're
[20:42] looking for a body change
[20:44] because this isn't because this is not
[20:46] this is going to die this is going to
[20:48] deteriorate
[20:49] so don't say my flesh made me do it no
[20:51] your flesh didn't make you do it that
[20:52] guy right there made you do it
[20:54] he didn't listen to this guy this guy if
[20:56] you're born again
[20:59] well come on somebody
[21:01] you're not listening to the end what I
[21:02] tell you a year ago let it out well we
[21:05] want to not we don't want to take and
[21:07] put a a a big ring around that and not
[21:10] let it out we need to let out what's
[21:12] inside of you whether it's good or bad
[21:15] all right because that unclean Spirit
[21:16] has got to come out of you it can't stay
[21:19] there
[21:20] anybody with me
[21:21] so then we got memories and conscious
[21:23] faction imagination now those flus
[21:27] you God can't look I'm sorry
[21:29] God can't stop those up because he gave
[21:31] you this is where you got to be in the
[21:34] word of God be in the Bible listen to
[21:37] the correct word of God that tells you
[21:39] that Satan can still play with your
[21:41] memory
[21:43] Satan can still play with your affection
[21:45] listen you don't love your wife in that
[21:47] inner Realm
[21:50] no
[21:51] no you either love God or the devil
[21:54] right here
[21:55] this is where you love your wife
[21:59] anybody with me
[22:00] but if you got the love of God it'll
[22:02] teach you how to love your wife
[22:04] it'll teach you how to love your brother
[22:05] and listen you know what he'll do right
[22:07] up there he'll teach you how to love
[22:09] people I hate you yeah
[22:10] yeah it's real easy to love people that
[22:12] love you
[22:14] but it's not real easy to love somebody
[22:16] that you know hates you
[22:18] but that's what that's growth
[22:19] development that's all of us growing up
[22:21] in Grace and knowledge so sanctification
[22:24] in that real inner realm if all that
[22:28] unclean Spirit goes out you have faith
[22:31] in your soul you are born again you are
[22:33] a son and daughter of God there's no way
[22:36] you cannot be
[22:38] if you're born again
[22:40] now if you're not this is where brother
[22:42] Branham is real clear and the spirit of
[22:44] this age is what
[22:46] you can have the Holy Spirit where
[22:50] on your spirit Realm
[22:54] thank you love God
[22:56] Prophet said but you love the devil
[22:58] you can reason memory card you have all
[23:01] these working
[23:02] in a spiritual religious Realm
[23:07] and be dead right here
[23:09] and lost and go to hell
[23:12] that's right brother so you can have it
[23:14] you can have the Holy Ghost on your
[23:15] spirit
[23:16] every day in your life and dying go to
[23:18] hell why because you never as we're
[23:20] going to read I think I've got it for
[23:21] either today or or this evening where
[23:24] they come say Lord have I not
[23:26] done Mighty works in your name have I
[23:29] not spoken tongues have I not in other
[23:31] words preached the message of the hour
[23:33] for 40 years
[23:39] but it never came from here it came from
[23:41] anointing
[23:43] of God anointing for this age Joel says
[23:46] I'll pour out my spirit on what
[23:48] All Flesh
[23:50] everybody's anointed listen the devil
[23:53] was the number one anointing guy right
[23:55] so he put his anointing out
[23:58] and God's got an anointing that he put
[24:00] out
[24:01] and thank god brother Brown priest I you
[24:03] know you've heard why I said it brother
[24:04] one time said when he first came in a
[24:06] message that he was doing just fine
[24:08] until he listened to anointed ones at
[24:11] the end time
[24:13] Bill Johnson said it scared him to death
[24:16] it should because that's the deception
[24:18] of this age not another age this age if
[24:21] you can sit in church listen praise the
[24:23] Lord a preacher can stand up here how
[24:26] many times have I told you
[24:28] I listened to a preacher preach about
[24:29] the Millennium that he preached it so
[24:32] good I still have notes off what that
[24:35] brother preached and while he was
[24:37] standing in the Pulpit he was sleeping
[24:38] with a 14 year old girl
[24:41] he didn't have anything right here
[24:44] he was he had got under an anointing
[24:49] and he preached the gospel you know what
[24:51] God allowed him to do it
[24:54] but your Folly will be made manifest
[24:57] somewhere down the road all right
[24:59] somewhere down the road you're gonna
[25:01] fall off somewhere down the road that
[25:02] Razor's Edge you're either going to go
[25:04] what this way or this way and with a
[25:06] razor once you slide off one side
[25:09] how you ever gonna get back to Center
[25:11] you can't
[25:12] you got to go back to here
[25:15] and get on this side all right that's
[25:17] why it's a Razor's Edge this whole thing
[25:19] is a is a fine line between an anointing
[25:23] and Truth
[25:24] all right so now if the unclean Spirit
[25:27] goes out
[25:29] of your soul and God fills your soul
[25:31] with the Holy Ghost then what are we
[25:32] working on now
[25:34] what are we working on now we're working
[25:36] on the spirit Realm
[25:38] we're working on the memory region
[25:40] conscious affection imagination because
[25:42] that's where you are going to come to
[25:45] adoption that's where brother Brown said
[25:47] power without character it's satanic
[25:50] power without character that's those
[25:53] people that preach and have all kind of
[25:55] power and signs and lying wonders and
[25:57] we're going to read about that in a
[25:58] little bit but they never come to the
[26:00] what knowledge
[26:01] of the truth
[26:03] well I believe brother Brown was a
[26:05] prophet yes the devil does too folks
[26:08] he knew when that man stood up there he
[26:10] said do you don't you hear that demon
[26:12] screaming to that demon over there
[26:16] I pray that one day we get to that spot
[26:18] right
[26:20] I don't care if I wanna I don't know if
[26:21] I want to hear him or not I'd scare you
[26:23] to death
[26:24] but I want them to be so scared that
[26:26] they don't even want to come into this
[26:28] building
[26:29] didn't brother Brown Say
[26:31] didn't the Bible say a sinner would not
[26:33] be able to sit in the congregation of
[26:35] the righteous toward the end I'm just
[26:37] telling you Bible why because that thing
[26:39] inside of you is going to be screaming I
[26:41] don't want that
[26:43] but oh there's going to be a group of
[26:44] people
[26:45] it's gonna say that's
[26:48] not me that and nothing else
[26:52] there's a group of people
[26:54] on the Earth today brother John I
[26:55] believe that
[26:57] I believe I'm looking at some of them I
[27:00] you know you always uh the devil does
[27:02] the devil ever talk to y'all
[27:07] hey Mike okay well then I just thought
[27:09] maybe it was me
[27:11] the devil told me that I said I was
[27:13] praying the other day I said Lord
[27:15] I want this church to be like
[27:18] the church at Ephesus
[27:20] now we got more than 12 obviously but
[27:22] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[27:25] they were all
[27:33] 12 people but they all felt were filled
[27:36] the Holy Ghost I said I want all my
[27:38] people filled with the Holy Ghost
[27:39] everybody I come in contact with
[27:40] everybody in this building I want to
[27:42] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[27:44] their soul
[27:46] make your job easier about that much
[27:49] but not that much because we still got
[27:51] that other man to work on but you know
[27:53] what the devil said
[27:55] the devil said he said now you don't
[27:57] think brother you don't think the devil
[27:59] quote brother random
[28:02] he said you know the prophet said they'd
[28:05] be made Believers True Believers and
[28:06] unbelievers in every
[28:12] every congregation
[28:16] sometime on Wednesday night the other
[28:18] Wednesday night when I was home with
[28:19] June they went to the field y'all here
[28:21] y'all just look around see what's going
[28:23] on sometime
[28:25] boy you get them quiet don't you
[28:29] that's what the devil said but you know
[28:30] I said devil I said that's okay
[28:33] but you did say we have Believers in
[28:35] there
[28:36] all right so we got Believers make
[28:38] Believers unbelievers in every
[28:40] congregation but you know what I want
[28:41] those unbelievers and mate Believers to
[28:43] become Believers because they can
[28:46] it's not it's not
[28:48] it's not
[28:49] unfathomable that every one of you can
[28:51] have the Holy Ghost
[28:53] and that you can all have an experience
[28:55] with God
[28:56] inside your soul and then what does God
[28:58] want to do he doesn't want to leave you
[29:00] a baby he doesn't just take the baby and
[29:02] put you over in the corner and say good
[29:04] looking baby
[29:06] now he wants you to feed the baby
[29:08] he wants that baby to grow up
[29:11] we'll talk about that in just a few
[29:13] minutes if he'll give me a little Grace
[29:14] here
[29:16] but listen to this you want to know how
[29:18] in the world why how are we going to get
[29:21] this power how are we going to get these
[29:22] virtues how's these things going to work
[29:24] in our life go ahead and pull the next
[29:25] quote up blind brought a mess brother
[29:27] around said just like the brass serpent
[29:29] the serpent didn't have no virtue it was
[29:32] a piece of brass
[29:33] they brought up out of Egypt neither did
[29:35] the poll have any virtue not a bit but
[29:38] it was obeying what God Said do
[29:44] God tells us to forsake not the
[29:46] assembling of ourselves together
[29:47] if you don't do that you're not obeying
[29:49] God's word
[29:52] obey is greater than what sacrifice well
[29:55] my kids are home this weekend I've done
[29:57] told you
[29:58] that's the worst example of a Christian
[30:00] you could be is stay home because you're
[30:02] unbelieving kids are home with you
[30:06] drag them to church or tell them to do
[30:08] something else while you go to church
[30:12] I told you a long time ago Jim's dad
[30:14] when we first
[30:15] come back to the Lord Jim's dad
[30:17] lovely man I wish you I wish he was born
[30:19] again he'd be a real good believer
[30:22] because he thinks goodness is going to
[30:23] get him to Heaven just being a good man
[30:25] and we pray for him we still pray for
[30:27] him that the Lord will turn that into a
[30:29] new birth
[30:31] but you know they always said always we
[30:33] you know they know your family knows
[30:35] your life more than anybody else they
[30:37] see you every day of the week and they
[30:38] see you in your history of what you were
[30:40] before
[30:41] oh he'll be he'll you know he will he
[30:44] that that's just something temporary
[30:46] he'll he'll be right back you know the
[30:48] way he does and then he comes over on
[30:50] Saturday him and his wife comes over on
[30:52] Saturday and then they stay for Sunday
[30:54] and they want us to stay home so we can
[30:56] go do something because he's going to
[30:58] take us out eat or he's going to give us
[30:59] some money or he's going to do something
[31:00] well guess what the first thing we did
[31:03] we said Eugene that's fine
[31:06] you stay right here
[31:07] the coffee's over there
[31:09] food's in the refrigerator we'll be back
[31:12] about five o'clock
[31:14] or you can go with us and meet these
[31:17] great people that we're around
[31:19] I know I told you many times before I
[31:20] tell John and eating my my father-in-law
[31:22] thought my dad was the only person that
[31:24] believed brother around was a prophet
[31:26] just a little crazy cult that we had but
[31:29] you know what God did you've heard my
[31:30] story before you know what God did God
[31:33] allowed him to come to our house and
[31:36] their step brother prakash from India
[31:40] he allowed him to come one weekend and
[31:42] that was brother Keith Reed
[31:44] from Jamaica
[31:46] that was brother George Quinn from
[31:48] Ireland and all these brothers come and
[31:50] then they're like he's like well who
[31:54] believes this thing and I I said this
[31:56] worldwide
[31:58] it's not just something that Samuel Dale
[32:01] uh you know concocted up and found us
[32:03] this one prophet and we're all believing
[32:05] it and that's it no
[32:08] but God allowed him to see that there's
[32:11] more than just
[32:12] a cult
[32:17] sometimes we're not even a good cult
[32:18] because the cult does what the leader
[32:20] tells him to do come on somebody
[32:22] haha
[32:24] just saying
[32:27] what brought the power or The Virtue is
[32:30] obedience to the word of God
[32:32] amen okay you say how can I do that read
[32:35] your Bible and pray
[32:38] that is your obedience
[32:41] this is the curriculum there is no other
[32:44] book this is the curriculum all right we
[32:46] have 1100 enhanced versions of that
[32:50] amen nobody with me
[32:52] the prophet of God had to because we'll
[32:54] read it here in just a minute
[32:56] well a little bit later on where that he
[32:58] had to come back there had to be an
[33:00] anointing come in the end time to take
[33:02] us back to the word of God the true word
[33:04] of God men had a part of the word of God
[33:06] Luther had a little bit of light Wesley
[33:07] had a little bit of light Pentecost had
[33:09] a little bit of light but they didn't
[33:10] have the full light
[33:12] like I said before you tell the people
[33:15] when you're talking to them say look
[33:18] they said well you just you know they
[33:20] call Brother Donny's Church the skirt
[33:21] Church
[33:22] well now the Bible tells the sisters not
[33:25] to wear pants right
[33:26] it's in the Bible I don't care if it's
[33:27] in the Old Testament or new
[33:30] because the Ten Commandments is in the
[33:32] Old Testament too you're going to throw
[33:33] them out
[33:34] huh Jesus was in the Old Testament you
[33:37] want to throw him out
[33:38] amen
[33:40] but who told you you didn't have to wear
[33:42] them dress
[33:44] Ed wasn't God
[33:46] and the devil that's only two powers
[33:48] that they are all right same way with
[33:51] cutting hair and all that other stuff
[33:52] all the other things that we we it's in
[33:54] the Bible
[33:55] we can read it out of the Bible who told
[33:57] you you could do something different
[33:58] that's where all these denominations
[34:00] come from that's where all these and
[34:01] look at the Methodist Church now the
[34:03] Methodist Church is getting ready to
[34:05] implode
[34:06] they don't know what to do
[34:09] have a gay priest
[34:13] Martin Luther
[34:15] John Wesley would have a heart attack if
[34:19] they were here watching what happened to
[34:20] their because look but remember Razor's
[34:23] Edge
[34:25] got off the word
[34:27] and just kept going off
[34:30] if they elect gay priests and all that
[34:32] stuff in the Methodist Church well you
[34:34] know they're dead anyway but it's really
[34:35] going to be
[34:37] people are going to pull away
[34:40] maybe we'll get them to the truth
[34:43] there's a lot of people looking for
[34:45] truth out there folks you talk to people
[34:47] they are not satisfied with their
[34:48] denomination because it's not taking
[34:50] them anywhere
[34:51] there's nothing for them oh yeah we'll
[34:54] just go to church and you know you can
[34:56] do that in a lodge
[34:58] you can do the things they do in the
[34:59] Baptist Church in the lodge then you can
[35:01] go outside and smoke and drink do
[35:02] whatever you know
[35:04] must be like the world
[35:06] but we're different
[35:08] we're different because God's inside of
[35:09] us
[35:10] because God's different because they
[35:13] they said Jesus your bills above you're
[35:15] you're the prince of devils you're a
[35:16] Wine Drinker you you run around with
[35:18] Sinners and prostitutes
[35:22] they called him a devil and he was the
[35:24] word of God
[35:25] he was all this right here
[35:28] plus the head
[35:30] and they called him that what are they
[35:31] gonna call me and you
[35:33] same identical thing brother Ryan said
[35:35] we're not building an organization I'm
[35:37] not here in the building organization
[35:38] Christ never said sent me to build
[35:40] organization Christ sent me to build
[35:42] individuals
[35:45] Christ sent me to build individuals to
[35:47] the stature of Jesus Christ that they
[35:49] might be what the powerhouse
[35:53] dunamis
[35:54] Dynamite
[35:56] blow all this other stuff out of the way
[35:59] that they might be the PowerHouse look
[36:01] and the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[36:04] his word
[36:05] by his word see build up the individual
[36:07] to that place then we were talking about
[36:09] the third pull because brother Ram said
[36:12] one time he's talking about virtue he
[36:13] said the woman the woman at the uh that
[36:16] touched the Hem of His Garment she
[36:17] pulled virtue out of him all right so
[36:19] let's look at the third pull just for a
[36:20] few minutes or three pulls because we
[36:22] want to I know there's some new ones
[36:23] here that don't understand this but just
[36:25] put this this is justification
[36:27] sanctification this is your walk all
[36:30] right this is our walk interpreted by a
[36:33] prophet that told us the first pull was
[36:35] what sign in the hand outside
[36:38] signing a hand right
[36:40] the second pull was discernment he
[36:42] actually pulled the virtues out of the
[36:44] people because the people would walk up
[36:45] to him and he said oh I see that you're
[36:47] you live on 29th Street and you see you
[36:49] saw a doctor yesterday that wore glasses
[36:52] and and had a a nurse you know she had
[36:54] on a blue suit I mean she he was so
[36:56] vivid
[36:59] so he could he could have just said I
[37:01] saw you sitting there talking to the
[37:02] doctor now he gave him the color of the
[37:04] things that was in that room
[37:06] I said oh I see you now though I see you
[37:08] later on or I see a baby in your lap
[37:11] well what was that that was what was
[37:13] inside that person that person wanted to
[37:15] know what God had for their life and
[37:18] that discernment pulled the virtues out
[37:21] and you know what it done it cleaned a
[37:23] group of people up
[37:25] and set them aside for service brother
[37:26] the people would walk up to him he said
[37:28] oh I see you have a a warm spirit
[37:34] but he would also say
[37:36] remember I told you that one I didn't
[37:38] read it but I quoted it the other week
[37:40] that guy came up said I want to quit
[37:42] smoking cigarettes well brother Brown
[37:44] discerned that oh I see you want to quit
[37:46] smoking he said but your greatest
[37:47] problem is is you need to be born again
[37:50] so if you'll go get born against them
[37:52] cigarettes or go away you know what he's
[37:54] exactly right
[37:55] if 94 Bush should tell you sitting right
[37:57] there you get the Holy Ghost you don't
[37:59] smoke no more
[38:01] this is not alcohol it's Anonymous this
[38:03] is not Reformation
[38:05] this is an ex this is a change of your
[38:08] whole nature
[38:10] that's the kind of God
[38:12] I
[38:14] just I love him for that because he took
[38:17] a ranked Center
[38:19] like me and like you just took us and
[38:21] give us the Holy Ghost give us the
[38:24] greatest message that ever fall on the
[38:25] face of this Earth gave us a place to
[38:28] live gave us a place to go to church
[38:32] gave us an ear to hear
[38:34] gave us eyes to see
[38:38] and sometimes we just sit there and
[38:40] stare
[38:42] so the third poll then
[38:45] or the third part of your journey is the
[38:47] opening of the word
[38:48] God can't open the word if you don't
[38:50] have the Holy Ghost now look he can give
[38:52] you part he can give you little crumbs
[38:54] he gave what Ruth he gave her a handful
[38:57] of purpose he gave her some things he
[38:59] didn't give her the whole crop
[39:02] she went after the crop she was after
[39:03] the man that owned the crop
[39:06] amen
[39:08] so the opening of the word is the son of
[39:10] man that's the Seven Seals that's that's
[39:12] once we get all the way up to the top
[39:14] because I want people to understand that
[39:17] I know that those of you that are in the
[39:19] message you've been in a message a long
[39:20] time we talk about being third pool
[39:22] people
[39:23] we are not third pool people until we're
[39:26] second poor people
[39:27] we've got to have the sanctifying of
[39:30] that man
[39:31] in our spirit and soul working to where
[39:36] we as brother ram calls us the
[39:37] powerhouse
[39:40] and brother Brown also said he said
[39:41] power without character is satanic but
[39:45] Power with character
[39:46] is fit to rule
[39:48] so the second poll will look at the
[39:50] loudest in church age I took this in two
[39:52] parts because uh brother John you know
[39:54] we sometimes we quote these things and
[39:55] we quote them and then people go well
[39:57] what do you really mean by that because
[39:59] brother Ryan tells us now this messenger
[40:00] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 is going
[40:02] to do two things why is he going to do
[40:05] two things one according to Malachi 4
[40:07] he'll turn the hearts of the children to
[40:08] the fathers so he's going to put us back
[40:11] to the faith of what Paul come on
[40:14] Matthew John
[40:18] Peter that's where the faith of them
[40:22] bring it back to here now that's not
[40:24] going to take us in a Rapture though
[40:27] that's not going to change our body it
[40:29] didn't change theirs
[40:31] we've got to come to a place though to
[40:33] where God can use us by the statue of
[40:36] perfect man or the revelation of the Son
[40:38] of God which is the Holy Ghost inside of
[40:40] you in that what in that control room
[40:43] working his way out
[40:46] everybody with me on this but the third
[40:49] poll then is number the second part that
[40:51] brother Brown would come to do are the
[40:53] messenger of Malachi for he'll reveal
[40:55] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[40:57] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[40:59] contained in those Seven Seals it'll be
[41:01] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[41:03] so in other words we got to go up a
[41:04] little bit higher
[41:07] that literally turned the hearts of the
[41:08] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[41:10] exactly so so watch the seals the seals
[41:12] are the son of man that's the headstone
[41:14] coming back to the church that's what we
[41:16] need for a body change and that's also
[41:19] what we need to draw us or pull us
[41:21] up into that statue of perfect man to
[41:23] pull us up into another dimension
[41:26] because you know what we're not of this
[41:28] dimension
[41:31] we're of another world
[41:34] people look for aliens
[41:39] we're not green
[41:41] we're humans
[41:43] but we're hidden
[41:45] by God
[41:47] to walk into this world Jesus was so hid
[41:50] they thought he was the devil he was so
[41:52] hid they thought he was that he was a
[41:54] wine bibber they thought he was he
[41:57] didn't wash his hands
[41:59] we'll read that in just a minute because
[42:01] I want you to see what he called these
[42:02] people we're going to get to that if we
[42:03] don't get anything else everybody with
[42:05] me because you think oh here's the
[42:07] Prince of Peace he's just so lovely
[42:09] he's so wonderful
[42:10] he's so kind
[42:12] he's the same guy that planted ropes
[42:15] he's the same guy that's fixing to call
[42:17] call his disciples stupid
[42:21] remember brother Dale he said I want to
[42:23] use that word I need to use it three or
[42:25] four times I don't want to use that word
[42:26] no
[42:29] it's okay to be ignorant okay everyone
[42:32] else said it's okay to be ignorant
[42:34] everybody's ignorant of certain things
[42:35] I'm ignorant of I can't put a car
[42:37] together
[42:39] but if I wanted to try there would
[42:40] there's a certain what school I got to
[42:43] go to somebody with me there's a certain
[42:45] school I got to go to to learn how to do
[42:46] that all right I want to learn how to be
[42:49] a better Christian I want to learn how
[42:50] to be a Powerhouse of God I want to
[42:52] learn how to be whether that there's a
[42:54] nod in my heart that I can go pray for
[42:56] somebody
[42:57] do you not want that
[42:58] that's what I want oh I pray don't make
[43:00] a mistake you're human
[43:03] but if it's God doing it he never will
[43:05] make a mistake
[43:06] we gotta let God take over
[43:10] the evening Messenger will bring back
[43:12] the church to the word now what is this
[43:14] master of Malachi for to do restore back
[43:17] the original Faith look the resurrection
[43:19] faith
[43:21] that's why we're heading toward folks
[43:23] we're not heading toward a body change
[43:24] yet
[43:25] we got to have enough Faith to bring the
[43:27] dead as brother John will say we got to
[43:29] get the dead out of the ground first
[43:32] what you're allowing to remain shall be
[43:34] changed and then we'll go on a rapture
[43:38] restore back the original Faith the
[43:41] resurrection faith that they seen Jesus
[43:43] after he had raised from the dead seen
[43:45] him working among them they were men of
[43:48] few words they went forth and preached a
[43:49] word oh they preached long that's where
[43:51] Stephen gets his brother Brown's quote
[43:54] right there they preach long
[43:57] enough where Paul preached 190 priests
[44:00] all night
[44:01] and a man fell out of a building and he
[44:03] killed him and you know what he thought
[44:05] here's Paul possible bless God he fell
[44:08] out of there because he won't listen to
[44:09] me no he said Hey listen he said God
[44:12] that's my fault
[44:14] I preached so long to the the humanity
[44:17] that the guy was sitting there and he
[44:19] was trying his best I believe to listen
[44:21] to Paul and he just got sleepy and fell
[44:24] out well Paul Paul if it was me I'd feel
[44:26] obligated to go down and pray for the
[44:28] guy
[44:29] because that partly my fault I'm going
[44:31] to try to keep him up all night so we're
[44:33] not going to do that today all right
[44:35] he laid his body over and brought him
[44:37] back to life but see what that showed
[44:38] power
[44:39] that showed the power that Paul had Paul
[44:42] didn't have to go fast for three days
[44:46] he didn't have to go do something
[44:47] special something
[44:48] he just knew in his heart you know what
[44:51] he did what brother Brown say how these
[44:53] people get healed because I enter into
[44:55] their situation
[44:58] that little lady that the little kid was
[45:00] healed before brother around me even
[45:01] touched a kid
[45:02] he said she was healed right over here
[45:04] because that mother that knew what that
[45:07] mother was going through with the baby
[45:08] and so he prayed for her and she was
[45:10] healed right there hard for people to
[45:12] realize that women can pray for the sick
[45:17] well praise the Lord anyhow
[45:20] foreign
[45:21] he laid his body over him and brought
[45:23] him back to life again
[45:25] look wait a minute
[45:27] he kept on preaching
[45:29] after he preached all night
[45:31] kept on preaching
[45:35] don't read that in this brother Stephen
[45:36] y'all be in trouble
[45:39] three hours is good
[45:41] now what's he gonna do he's going to
[45:42] turn the heart of the children to the
[45:43] fathers we're talking about this man
[45:45] that we caught William Bradham now it's
[45:46] not the man it's the message it's the
[45:48] anointing that he had on him now listen
[45:50] him and his message was one he was the
[45:54] Elijah of this day he yielded himself to
[45:57] that and became the prophet in the end
[46:00] time remember he was always a prophet
[46:01] but he had to listen it's hard to see
[46:04] where you that brother Brown said I used
[46:06] to wash my car on Sunday and watching
[46:08] people go to church
[46:09] a prophet
[46:11] yeah he was lost
[46:15] he needed saving he was going to be a
[46:18] murderer
[46:20] he was going to commit suicide twice
[46:24] twice he was going to kill that boy
[46:26] he was going to kill that man
[46:29] and he would have if it hadn't been for
[46:30] God
[46:33] that's the same way with me and you
[46:35] Satan had loved to kill us all right now
[46:36] but there's something God has for each
[46:38] and every one of us that's why you're
[46:40] here that's why you're listening today
[46:42] that's why you're at least giving God
[46:45] some time
[46:46] to soften you up
[46:48] remember what I we preaching a long time
[46:51] ago that
[46:53] Stony heart we're all born with it but
[46:55] God didn't take that Stony heart out I'm
[46:58] Stony heart out and put a heart of Flesh
[47:00] in there and then put his flesh from I
[47:02] mean his Spirit remember
[47:05] he said then he puts his Spirit that's
[47:07] your spirit
[47:08] he said that's so you can get along with
[47:09] yourself
[47:11] that's so that God can get along with
[47:13] you then he puts the holy spirit in then
[47:16] he puts his spirit in after he siphoned
[47:19] you up
[47:20] to me that's the journey that we take
[47:23] I know some people get born again just
[47:25] like that but I was just slow I'm a
[47:27] southerner I it took a while
[47:30] maybe it didn't y'all
[47:32] but it took me a while
[47:34] but I do know brother John I do know my
[47:36] journey
[47:37] I can put you through every part of that
[47:39] Journey can you you ought to be able to
[47:41] if you're born again
[47:43] if you're not then you're an idiot born
[47:44] again then you'll look back and say oh
[47:46] that's what that Journey was all about
[47:48] that's the situation I was in that's the
[47:50] things I'd done or didn't do to get me
[47:52] to where I'm at today
[47:53] he'll be taking the message of Pentecost
[47:56] to turn the children to the faith of the
[47:57] fathers because he'll be rebuking them
[48:00] what because they didn't keep this same
[48:02] faith
[48:03] they went off into
[48:05] tongues of the evidence they went off
[48:07] into trinitarianism and Tunis and all
[48:10] these different things Oneness
[48:12] so he's got to bring that Faith back to
[48:14] where we look when we stand here today
[48:16] as Christians
[48:18] take away the message part
[48:20] we stand here as Christians
[48:23] you gotta believe something
[48:25] if you say I'm a Christian today you
[48:28] either gotta you gotta attach yourself
[48:30] to Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[48:33] independent
[48:34] Church of God
[48:36] you got to attach yourself to somewhere
[48:37] because when you say I'm a Christian
[48:39] then the world says why or how
[48:42] do you follow well sure we follow Christ
[48:45] I know that
[48:46] but if you try to follow the Methodist
[48:49] Church and they're fixing to put
[48:51] a gay woman as your leader
[48:56] God forbid that's in the Bible too
[48:59] so what are they doing though the
[49:01] Methodist Church is supposed to be found
[49:03] their foundation's supposed to be on the
[49:04] Bible yet they're doing what the Bible
[49:05] said not to do
[49:07] all denominations have a part of that
[49:09] now I've got a quote where I'm gonna
[49:11] read you this afternoon brother Brown
[49:13] says that the Church of God has the Holy
[49:15] Ghost now this is back in his time each
[49:17] one of them has the baptism of the Holy
[49:19] Ghost for their time for their day that
[49:21] was Baptist that's going to be in heaven
[49:22] that's going to be that's been that's
[49:23] born again but once you're given this
[49:26] message
[49:27] once this message is presented to you
[49:29] you have no cloak
[49:30] you either gotta accept it or rejected
[49:33] brother Brown said word rejecters go to
[49:34] hell
[49:38] right
[49:40] I'll read to you a little bit in Romans
[49:42] said remember when you come to the
[49:43] knowledge of the truth there's no more
[49:45] sacrifice for that sin
[49:48] and notice here the first to last was to
[49:50] come he turned the hearts of the
[49:52] children to the fathers and he met he
[49:54] correct itself because it's the hearts
[49:56] in other words The Saul of man in the
[49:58] Old Testament could not be born again
[50:01] right
[50:03] the Old Testament Saints did not have
[50:05] the new birth in their soul because they
[50:07] were only capoed or covered by the blood
[50:10] of bulls and goats which had no life to
[50:13] come back into the believer
[50:15] they were covered though they had an
[50:17] anointing they were in the Old Testament
[50:18] they're going to be there but they're
[50:20] not bride
[50:26] because they didn't get it in their soul
[50:28] because Jesus hadn't come yet the Bible
[50:30] plainly says they didn't get the Holy
[50:31] Ghost because Jesus hadn't died yet or
[50:33] been glorified is what the scripture
[50:35] says all right but they had their part
[50:38] they played their part how many times
[50:40] did Brother Brown said Moses without the
[50:43] Holy Ghost called down flies fleas and
[50:45] frogs
[50:47] what about me and you with the Holy
[50:48] Ghost
[50:49] that's a dish to us
[50:52] Joshua without the Holy Ghost standstill
[50:58] wow
[51:00] that's why brother John when he read
[51:02] that about you know I quoted it the
[51:03] other day about brother I'm saying if
[51:05] you had the Holy Ghost you had enough
[51:06] power in you to go create a world and
[51:08] live on it
[51:10] right
[51:12] but there's a bar holding us there it's
[51:14] called our Flash and it's called others
[51:15] that need to get burned again we don't
[51:18] want to go off on an island by ourselves
[51:19] somewhere it would be nice sometime to
[51:21] create a world and go live on it but I
[51:24] want people to be around me I want
[51:25] people to be with me
[51:27] see the old patriarch fathers the old
[51:29] Orthodox the legalists the law he turned
[51:32] it back to the faith of the fathers what
[51:34] John was saying behold now the Lamb of
[51:36] God that takes away the sin of the world
[51:39] this is a new message
[51:40] this is not the old message the old
[51:42] message was bulls and goats one priest
[51:44] go behind go behind the veil put the
[51:47] blood on the Altar and what did Brother
[51:49] Brown say he said they come out
[51:52] if they were adulterer when they walked
[51:54] in they were adulterer when they walked
[51:56] out now I'm going to tell you something
[51:57] you go behind this holy of holy into
[52:00] that Holy of holy I was talking about if
[52:03] you wasn't an adulterer you won't be one
[52:05] because that piece of you is gone that
[52:07] part of you has been destroyed not just
[52:10] covered
[52:12] mm-hmm
[52:14] the hearts of the children this new
[52:15] message that John was preaching of the
[52:17] coming Messiah hand he turned the hearts
[52:20] of this but watch the next time John
[52:22] appears now he's talking about John the
[52:24] spirit of Elijah not John John's not
[52:26] coming back
[52:27] everybody with me you know what he's
[52:29] talking about he turns out he's talk he
[52:32] turns the hearts of the children back to
[52:34] the Pentecostal fathers
[52:36] so it'd be back to the original message
[52:39] what the book of Acts and you'll know
[52:42] when it gets here
[52:44] in other words he says you got the Holy
[52:46] Ghost you'll know
[52:47] today if you got the Holy Ghost you
[52:50] can't go very long in another church I'm
[52:53] not talking about this building
[52:56] y'all kind of quiet you asleep I'm not
[52:59] looking at all of you wake up
[53:02] but am I not telling you the truth thank
[53:05] you well you can say yeah okay
[53:09] it'll be a restoration look to send that
[53:13] lukewarm letter saying church back to
[53:15] that original Faith back Yonder again
[53:18] and he will be anointed to do so so
[53:22] that's the anointing that we're under
[53:24] that we are not just Pentecostals
[53:29] we're Pentecost plush
[53:31] we're back to this plus we're Baptist
[53:33] plus because they all have a piece
[53:36] listen the very method of our worship
[53:39] came from the Methodist Church
[53:43] that's why they called it
[53:45] Methodist thank you
[53:47] because it was a method of worship and
[53:49] God was pleased with that method of
[53:50] worship all right but now what's going
[53:52] to happen to me and you I will restore
[53:54] this is the promise I will restore to
[53:56] you the years the Locust eat the canker
[53:58] worm caterpillar Palm a worm so what
[54:02] happened is when Jesus left the Earth
[54:04] they started eating on what they started
[54:06] eating a church and they started eating
[54:07] a tree
[54:08] it was a bride tree then brother Brown
[54:10] says the bride tree he started eating at
[54:13] the bride tree and he almost ate it down
[54:15] to a stump
[54:17] but Lord thank you that you're going to
[54:19] restore all that back yes to the faith
[54:21] of the fathers he's going to restore
[54:23] that gift back
[54:24] I not only restore the gift back to us
[54:27] but he's going to give us a place of
[54:30] adoption to where we can be placed where
[54:32] God can use us like he wanted to use the
[54:35] first church he did but they fell from
[54:37] their first love why they accept decrees
[54:39] and denominations they accepted false
[54:42] Doctrine
[54:44] and you shall eat in plenty
[54:48] what a promise
[54:49] and be what satisfied
[54:53] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[54:55] you all ought to try that sometime
[54:57] some of you
[54:59] let half doubt what wondrously with you
[55:04] and my people shall not I'm not ashamed
[55:07] to stand here today
[55:08] I'm not ashamed to tell the world God
[55:10] sent a prophet I'm not ashamed to tell
[55:13] the world I understand what God said I'm
[55:15] not
[55:17] we have the mind of God
[55:20] it's not some thought over there or some
[55:22] idea it's the mind of God
[55:26] and why because we've opened ourselves
[55:28] up for the word not for the world
[55:32] you know there's only one word there's
[55:33] only one letter difference from world
[55:35] and word
[55:37] and that's an l loser
[55:43] listen we're all lost without God
[55:46] we're all losers
[55:48] that's what the man said one time he
[55:49] said I can't understand why
[55:52] brother Branham would call women or
[55:54] refer to him as dog meat I said brother
[55:56] if you're not born again you're a dog
[55:57] meat
[55:58] boy they don't like that
[56:00] I didn't like that at all he changed the
[56:03] subject but that's the truth you're all
[56:05] cannon fodder the Bible tells us
[56:08] that we'll walk out on the ashes of the
[56:10] wicked you're not gonna walk on
[56:12] somebody's been born again
[56:15] you're gonna be the one that walks out
[56:17] I'm not telling you this the Bible's
[56:18] told you that
[56:20] you're gonna walk out on the ashes of
[56:22] the wicked
[56:24] and be under your feet
[56:28] so let's look real quick for about
[56:30] because this is what we're preaching
[56:31] about I thought I'd insert this a little
[56:33] bit I know brother Stevens preaching on
[56:36] adoption too and this is all on adoption
[56:38] because it's going to be uh placing
[56:40] because brother Brown said what when
[56:42] when the the bride realizes what who she
[56:44] is and what she's doing here she'll be
[56:47] an invincible Army listen we're getting
[56:49] whipped all over the place we've got
[56:51] sickness we got our kids are not in them
[56:53] or not saying our friends are not saved
[56:56] our husbands or wives we can't beat
[56:57] around all over the place I don't care
[57:00] give me what the prophet said he said
[57:03] when you can do all stand
[57:07] right there and see the salvation of the
[57:10] Lord
[57:11] while the children of Israel they
[57:12] probably got all kind of nervous
[57:16] but you know what happened
[57:18] it was water that way
[57:20] there was some real mad Egyptians that
[57:22] way
[57:25] yeah they were standing in the middle
[57:28] they said we're done
[57:30] sometimes we have to get in that place
[57:32] till we say we're done
[57:35] and Moses
[57:37] stop your whining
[57:40] ain't nobody said Moses why cry
[57:44] speak and go forward he didn't say speak
[57:46] El backwards he said speak and what did
[57:49] Moses say this day
[57:52] those Egyptians that's been bothering
[57:54] you all your life
[57:56] you'll never see him again
[57:59] they'll be dead to you your life will be
[58:01] what heading toward the promised land
[58:03] head toward what all the great Miracles
[58:06] that God did over that way
[58:08] not back that way
[58:10] oh but we got a group of people that
[58:12] sits around going I wish I was back
[58:14] there
[58:15] no you don't
[58:18] does anybody ever eat a leek
[58:22] it's a real strong onion the strongest
[58:26] onion you ever eat in your life a leek
[58:28] is more than that it don't even sound
[58:30] good to eat a leek
[58:32] it's kind of like guacamole
[58:37] well here we go all right
[58:40] well at least it'll wake you up but
[58:42] leeks and garlic put those two together
[58:44] and eat it they'd rather eat that than
[58:47] to go on with God come on somebody
[58:49] that's ignorance
[58:51] the position of a believer
[58:53] now just a minute give me five more
[58:55] minutes
[58:56] to be real reverent give me a little
[58:58] more nap
[59:00] before the foundation of the world he's
[59:01] talking about Ephesians 4. that we
[59:03] should be holy Without Blame perform in
[59:05] love we read the scripture many many
[59:07] times brother Dale also having
[59:09] predestinated in other words for knowing
[59:11] not just predestination you got to look
[59:14] at foreknowledge first because that's
[59:15] before hand
[59:17] he has what predestinated US unto what
[59:19] the adoption
[59:21] children
[59:23] Christ to himself according to pleasure
[59:25] of his good will now brother that was
[59:27] the scripture now this is Brother Brown
[59:29] I want to read this this is probably
[59:30] this quote puts everything together
[59:32] there's a hundred quotes that you can
[59:33] talk about adoption but this one kind of
[59:36] just places it and we'll read it and
[59:37] then we'll close we'll start back this
[59:39] afternoon
[59:40] I don't want to tell you too much John
[59:42] and him is going to be gone so I want
[59:44] them to
[59:47] hey
[59:54] now let's take the loss of the Old
[59:56] Testament for a shout out watch this
[59:57] real quick
[59:59] and will you bear with me just a moment
[1:00:00] before closing
[1:00:01] now under the law the order of the law
[1:00:04] of the old ultimate which is the title
[1:00:06] which is the type of this day
[1:00:09] remember the Bible says that all that
[1:00:11] was given for an example Moses was given
[1:00:13] an example for this day Moses had given
[1:00:15] Isaiah was given all the different
[1:00:16] prophets were given looking what to us
[1:00:19] every one of them said we want to live
[1:00:21] in that day
[1:00:22] remember when Jesus was here they said
[1:00:24] the prophet they said they desired to
[1:00:25] see this day
[1:00:28] in a family of man
[1:00:30] when a child was born in the family
[1:00:32] as soon as the boy was born he was the
[1:00:35] son of that family all right so how many
[1:00:37] how many messages did we spend of those
[1:00:39] 80 showing that faith is the foundation
[1:00:42] it is the birth it is putting you into
[1:00:45] the family of God is everybody with me
[1:00:47] all right
[1:00:48] the father loved him of course
[1:00:52] listen we all love our children right I
[1:00:54] don't care what they're doing we love
[1:00:55] them
[1:00:57] you better
[1:00:58] he said Well mine's got doing this so I
[1:01:00] ain't got
[1:01:02] I take a bullet for any one of my kids
[1:01:04] I don't care if they're just the SARS
[1:01:06] people ever lived on the face of the
[1:01:07] Earth they're still my kids
[1:01:09] they're still mine you know what
[1:01:12] got to take one for your sorry rear end
[1:01:14] too
[1:01:15] amen he did he got hung on Cross for me
[1:01:18] and you hey man let's not forget Calvary
[1:01:20] let's don't forget what he did for us
[1:01:23] do not ever forget that when we get the
[1:01:26] lowest of low
[1:01:27] just remember he did all that for us
[1:01:30] and you know what he knew you'd make it
[1:01:35] as soon as the boy was born
[1:01:37] he was the son of that family if you're
[1:01:40] born again today you are right
[1:01:44] and you are in the family of God
[1:01:47] and you are what though but you're put
[1:01:49] into the family of God to what to get
[1:01:51] these gifts
[1:01:53] to get these wonderful things
[1:01:55] you know Mom and Dad gave us some
[1:01:57] wonderful gifts at Christmas didn't give
[1:01:59] y'all one well they did but you
[1:02:01] understand what I mean family to family
[1:02:03] right
[1:02:04] I love bro John and sister Edie but I
[1:02:07] didn't invite them to my Christmas party
[1:02:09] because they're not Dales right
[1:02:12] same way with God
[1:02:14] listen God's a jealous God he wished
[1:02:16] everybody would come he compelled them
[1:02:19] to come but they
[1:02:21] so what does he do he holds his
[1:02:23] attention on his bride he holds his
[1:02:25] attention on his family I'm gonna send
[1:02:27] you the best of the best I'm gonna give
[1:02:30] you the best message at the best time it
[1:02:32] may be dark out there it may be dreary
[1:02:35] but I'm going to give you the best
[1:02:37] I'm gonna give you a chance to get out
[1:02:39] of here
[1:02:42] he loved us more than just that it's not
[1:02:45] feel your love
[1:02:47] it's agape love
[1:02:49] and agape love look
[1:02:51] has no boundaries
[1:02:54] listen all we can do is love our husband
[1:02:58] and wife and our kids conditionally
[1:03:01] I say humanly humanly
[1:03:05] now when we get the love of God that's
[1:03:07] when we love him unconditionally
[1:03:09] but man I ain't like my kids when I
[1:03:10] wasn't born again I like my kids
[1:03:14] I ain't like well you know what my dad
[1:03:16] didn't like me either
[1:03:18] my heavenly father don't look over him
[1:03:23] he loved me because he knew we were
[1:03:24] coming so
[1:03:26] that's a good thing that that the Lord
[1:03:27] showed him
[1:03:29] amen
[1:03:30] the father loved him of course
[1:03:33] then if you get over in Galatians you
[1:03:34] talk about you know tutors and governors
[1:03:37] then the father had so much work to do
[1:03:39] over the whole Kingdom
[1:03:42] what do you want to do you know God can
[1:03:44] run let's just stop for a second God can
[1:03:47] run this world without us yes God can
[1:03:49] run the universe without us he can make
[1:03:52] every Star go in the right direction he
[1:03:54] can make everything go according to his
[1:03:56] plan but he decided to use you
[1:04:00] he decided to defeat the Devil through
[1:04:03] you yeah
[1:04:05] that's what he decided and you know what
[1:04:08] if that's my daddy and he decides that
[1:04:10] and he's gone he don't make a mistake
[1:04:12] yeah put me there
[1:04:16] the father had so much work to do over
[1:04:18] the whole Kingdom you know why that's
[1:04:20] why God's got angels
[1:04:22] those those angels do the work for for
[1:04:24] God
[1:04:26] well be quiet
[1:04:28] he sends angels
[1:04:31] he sends angels
[1:04:34] he was an angel Jesus said Angels talk
[1:04:37] to him and strengthen him and comfort
[1:04:38] him am I still in the Bible
[1:04:41] so we've got Angels today there's Angels
[1:04:43] standing around here and you know what
[1:04:45] they're doing there's an Angel going
[1:04:46] with you because I'm going to tell you
[1:04:47] what this is this tutor is an angel
[1:04:51] that sent to a Believer to go back to
[1:04:54] the father and say hey he's doing good
[1:04:56] or hey he needs a whipping
[1:05:00] everybody with me
[1:05:01] look
[1:05:03] he placed a tutor
[1:05:05] or a teacher over the Sun
[1:05:08] and this tutor brought word to the
[1:05:10] father all the time how the child was
[1:05:13] progressing
[1:05:14] a teacher anyone knows that was the Old
[1:05:17] Testament rule a tutor Paul speaks about
[1:05:20] the law being a tutor or School Master
[1:05:22] to bring us to Christ or an educator
[1:05:25] now as this the tutor began to watch the
[1:05:28] boy grow now remember he was already a
[1:05:30] son he was already a Christian let's
[1:05:33] just put it that way he was already in
[1:05:34] the family of God he was already what
[1:05:36] under the blessings of God
[1:05:39] all right
[1:05:40] but he had something to do to continue
[1:05:43] on to be what an adopted son of God
[1:05:48] because adoption is not like we say
[1:05:50] adoption we take somebody else's kid and
[1:05:52] we adopt him in the family now listen
[1:05:53] God don't adopt Satan's kids
[1:05:56] he adopted his own kids all right and
[1:05:59] adoption is really placing in the Bible
[1:06:01] not bringing somebody into your family
[1:06:03] listen we're not adopted kids
[1:06:08] we're born Sons and Daughters of God if
[1:06:11] you're born again you're not adopted but
[1:06:13] you have to come to adoption watch this
[1:06:15] he was a son
[1:06:17] the tutor began to watch the boy grow
[1:06:20] but yet the father didn't know what to
[1:06:22] do with him or what he would be when he
[1:06:25] growed up
[1:06:26] now our father does
[1:06:28] but he you know what he stands back
[1:06:30] unless you make the choice
[1:06:32] now to full to my full opinion friends
[1:06:35] listen real close now let's pray for me
[1:06:38] if I'm wrong
[1:06:39] what happened when the Full Gospel
[1:06:42] Church began way back Yonder years ago
[1:06:44] they became sons of God when they
[1:06:47] received the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:06:49] they come sons and the Holy Spirit is
[1:06:51] the tutor to raise them in the
[1:06:53] admonition of God now as the tutor has
[1:06:56] been watching the children and the
[1:06:58] church has been progressing coming up
[1:07:01] they've seen the age of birth you say
[1:07:03] born again that's right correct you're
[1:07:05] just as much sun as you'll ever be when
[1:07:07] you're born again
[1:07:09] but
[1:07:12] but
[1:07:12] the tutor bringing word to the father
[1:07:15] then if the Father the tutor comes to
[1:07:17] the father and the boy become about age
[1:07:20] about where the church ought to be now
[1:07:21] comes of age brightened up
[1:07:25] the Microsoft brighten up a little bit
[1:07:28] seasoned
[1:07:29] according to the time when the boy
[1:07:31] become of age the tutor come to the
[1:07:34] father and see the boy being a son
[1:07:36] already but yet he wasn't a worthy son
[1:07:42] he was the son
[1:07:44] power without character
[1:07:46] right he wasn't a worthy son
[1:07:50] listen those people that went to nicaea
[1:07:54] brother Brown said the bride went there
[1:07:55] in other words prophets went there
[1:07:58] they never got adopted they got beat
[1:07:59] down because it wasn't time
[1:08:02] it wasn't time for them to grow
[1:08:04] right you know who beat them down Satan
[1:08:06] beat him down they lost their first love
[1:08:07] and they started father-son Holy Ghost
[1:08:10] and all these different denominational
[1:08:11] ideas that's not even in the Bible if he
[1:08:14] wasn't a worthy son the father could not
[1:08:16] adopt him or place him into his own
[1:08:20] family
[1:08:21] he couldn't do it because the boy would
[1:08:23] run through what he had
[1:08:26] kind of like The Prodigal Son
[1:08:29] he was a Restless child
[1:08:31] in church out of church this time doing
[1:08:34] the other I can't do this I can't do
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:37] he didn't have the ability
[1:08:40] to carry on
[1:08:41] with the father's work
[1:08:43] now this is the sign
[1:08:45] so the father just let him go on as a
[1:08:48] son
[1:08:49] a lot of people when brother Brown stood
[1:08:51] up
[1:08:51] 60 years ago and said we're living below
[1:08:54] our privileges that's exactly what he
[1:08:56] meant he saw people that were born again
[1:08:58] but they got cold
[1:09:01] they got four
[1:09:05] four but if he was a fine boy
[1:09:07] he was about his father's business and
[1:09:10] the tutor brought word to the father
[1:09:11] saying that the son is fine
[1:09:13] he's eligible he's all right then the
[1:09:17] father took the son out into a public
[1:09:19] place as a public testimony
[1:09:22] I believe God took William Branham out
[1:09:25] to the mountain
[1:09:27] and produce that cloud
[1:09:29] I said this is my son hear ye him
[1:09:33] because remember he come back and
[1:09:34] preached his message to the seals we'll
[1:09:36] get to that later on and set him up
[1:09:38] before the people and the father looked
[1:09:41] by doing so give the son the authority
[1:09:44] over his kingdom
[1:09:46] over his business and so forth the son
[1:09:49] had a right to go out and do certain
[1:09:51] things in the Kingdom with the same kind
[1:09:54] of authority that his father had
[1:09:56] that's why we're living below our
[1:09:58] privileges because we don't believe that
[1:10:00] we don't believe that oh yeah well you
[1:10:02] get born again you're a child you you're
[1:10:05] able to do things but wow when we start
[1:10:08] going up this statue of perfect man
[1:10:09] which we've already in the virtue of
[1:10:11] knowledge
[1:10:12] what is that
[1:10:14] that's the father saying that a boy
[1:10:18] or I'm just going to let him be what he
[1:10:19] is
[1:10:21] that's what he did hold on man
[1:10:27] go down here a little bit further
[1:10:31] if he wasn't a worthy son the father
[1:10:33] cannot adopt him or place him he
[1:10:35] couldn't do it because the boy the Boy
[1:10:37] would run through what he had he didn't
[1:10:40] have the ability to carry on with his
[1:10:42] father's worth so the father just let
[1:10:44] him go on as a son
[1:10:46] that's why we live way below our
[1:10:48] privileges that's why we're so tossed
[1:10:50] about it's because we don't believe that
[1:10:52] we can be more than
[1:10:53] a son
[1:10:55] we can be an adopted son that's what I
[1:10:57] should have preached this you know back
[1:10:59] in about part 40 something because
[1:11:01] that's what we're heading to we're
[1:11:02] heading to adoptions we're heading to a
[1:11:03] place into where it's not you listen
[1:11:06] that Temperance right there
[1:11:10] well
[1:11:12] we gotta work on
[1:11:17] the knowledge when we're talking we're
[1:11:18] going to talk about knowledge you have
[1:11:20] to have knowledge for this world
[1:11:23] we have to Natural that don't don't drop
[1:11:25] out of school because we think that
[1:11:27] school is is of the devil or that
[1:11:30] brother Brown says the education is of
[1:11:31] the devil so people start pulling people
[1:11:33] out of school when we were 15 16 years
[1:11:35] old and look at people now
[1:11:39] right look at people now
[1:11:42] so get an education
[1:11:44] it's required in this time for you to
[1:11:47] get a good education
[1:11:49] and listen it's required that you get a
[1:11:51] good education here too
[1:11:53] it's required and then when you do guess
[1:11:56] what you get to do as my granny always
[1:11:58] said you get to gadget
[1:12:04] I got to read this over here because you
[1:12:05] got to hear it what what Jesus said
[1:12:07] right here
[1:12:09] and then we'll close musicians come on
[1:12:13] it may be for tonight we'll see I'll
[1:12:15] look and see
[1:12:23] oh here we go Matthew 15 verse 16. and
[1:12:27] Jesus said are you also yet without
[1:12:29] understanding that phrase means foolish
[1:12:33] unintelligent without understanding
[1:12:35] stupid
[1:12:39] Jesus said are you without understanding
[1:12:42] have I not told you said do not you
[1:12:44] understand that whatsoever enters into
[1:12:47] your mouth goes into the belly and out
[1:12:48] through the drop but those things which
[1:12:50] proceed out of the mouth come forth from
[1:12:52] the heart that's what defiles a man for
[1:12:55] out of the heart out of that throne room
[1:12:57] proceeds evil thoughts murders
[1:12:59] adulterers fornication thefts false
[1:13:01] witness and blasphemies these are the
[1:13:03] things which defile a man
[1:13:06] let's go be stupid
[1:13:08] so that's what Jesus said right here
[1:13:09] that comes from the Greek Greek Lexicon
[1:13:11] strong number 801 that means foolish
[1:13:13] unintelligent without understanding I'm
[1:13:16] stupid
[1:13:18] I tell you what folks if we miss this
[1:13:20] thing
[1:13:21] it's because of us it's not because of
[1:13:24] God he has given us let's stand our feet
[1:13:26] he has given us a prophet he's given us
[1:13:29] a five-fold Ministry he's given us now
[1:13:32] that 1100 sermons that we couldn't even
[1:13:34] put on this wall when we first was in
[1:13:36] this church because of the eight to take
[1:13:39] the seven inch reels now you can carry
[1:13:41] it almost in your watch if you've got an
[1:13:43] Apple Watch you pretty much got the
[1:13:44] whole message in a watch
[1:13:46] there's no excuse
[1:13:49] there's no excuse
[1:13:51] but I want us all to have virtue because
[1:13:53] what is virtue of virtue is strength and
[1:13:55] power
[1:13:56] it's dunamis
[1:13:58] we live an unfulfilled life because of
[1:14:02] our Disobedience to the word of God
[1:14:06] and brother Ryan said every word
[1:14:08] entitles you to the token in this end
[1:14:10] time we've got to have it to get out of
[1:14:13] here
[1:14:14] it's not some man listen it's not a
[1:14:16] man-made idea it's the Bible
[1:14:18] the Bible tells us to be Sons and
[1:14:21] Daughters of God to be a full age to not
[1:14:23] eat to not just drink milk but eat what
[1:14:26] strong meat not just meat strong meat
[1:14:29] that we can what grow thereby
[1:14:32] let's don't be malnourished this year
[1:14:34] let's eat everything God give us
[1:14:37] and grow in God
[1:14:39] I adore you
[1:14:41] get born again
[1:14:43] go to church
[1:14:45] read your Bible
[1:14:47] believe
[1:14:50] believe in what God's already done for
[1:14:52] you and what he's going to do for you
[1:14:55] listen we've got so many different
[1:14:57] people in this church that could stand
[1:15:00] and testify for hours of what God's done
[1:15:02] in their life why don't you try to be
[1:15:05] one of them
[1:15:06] well I don't have no testimony
[1:15:09] well I do
[1:15:14] you know why I had a journey I've come
[1:15:16] to a place where all that's quicker now
[1:15:18] I know why that happened you know why
[1:15:21] these things happen to you always mean
[1:15:23] well this thing happened to me I don't
[1:15:24] say that no more
[1:15:27] I know why those things happen to me
[1:15:28] just
[1:15:34] I'm a child of the king
[1:15:37] his Royal Blood now flows through my
[1:15:39] veins
[1:15:41] not literally but brother Brown said
[1:15:43] we're the bride is the blood by the
[1:15:44] spirit
[1:15:45] in the end time we're the only thing
[1:15:47] keeping this world together
[1:15:50] you and I as bad as we oh bro wait I got
[1:15:53] all these problems you ain't got no
[1:15:55] problems to live out there for a little
[1:15:57] while
[1:15:58] well I can't listen to what problems
[1:15:59] they have
[1:16:02] and you'll get on your knees and you'll
[1:16:04] thank God for the things that he's given
[1:16:07] you
[1:16:08] number one I'm thinking for the Holy
[1:16:11] Ghost
[1:16:12] because that's eternal life
[1:16:14] regardless it doesn't matter
[1:16:16] if I have shoes like like I read that I
[1:16:21] know brother Terry
[1:16:22] you wouldn't think he'd come from from
[1:16:24] that but he did
[1:16:25] and I was thinking the other day I
[1:16:28] thought Lord
[1:16:30] I drove by some oh and we were coming to
[1:16:32] Atlanta
[1:16:33] and
[1:16:34] I looked up under a bridge
[1:16:37] and there was a homeless
[1:16:39] shelter
[1:16:40] they had built out of tarps and
[1:16:43] had all kind of trash throwed around
[1:16:45] just a real junky place but you know
[1:16:47] what some of those people like to do
[1:16:49] that
[1:16:50] if you were to give them a hundred
[1:16:52] thousand dollars they would probably
[1:16:54] spend it all and still live under that
[1:16:56] bridge
[1:16:56] that's what but I'm telling you that's
[1:16:58] the same thing with me and you stop
[1:17:00] being that stop being a vagrant you're a
[1:17:02] son and daughter of God
[1:17:04] you get the new birth he'll put you in a
[1:17:06] palace
[1:17:07] he might not give you one here but you
[1:17:09] got one there
[1:17:11] you love the Lord don't be a vagrant
[1:17:13] don't be a vagabond don't be don't be
[1:17:15] somebody that ain't got nowhere to go
[1:17:17] that's miserable could you imagine as
[1:17:19] cold as it's been the last several weeks
[1:17:21] and you have to live under a bridge
[1:17:22] because you don't have any money
[1:17:25] because somebody won't give you a chance
[1:17:27] thank God God give us a chance
[1:17:29] he'd give us a chance regardless of what
[1:17:32] we've done he gave us a chance we're all
[1:17:35] on equal basis when it comes to that
[1:17:37] listen if if
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:40] um
[1:17:41] save for
[1:17:43] a fact that Sam Walton
[1:17:45] made it to heaven
[1:17:48] his Palace ain't going to be no bigger
[1:17:50] than mine
[1:17:51] his bank account ain't gonna be no
[1:17:53] bigger than mine his Street's gonna be
[1:17:57] gold my Street's gonna be gold
[1:18:00] because as I was telling somebody the
[1:18:01] other day do you know this if you took
[1:18:03] your life

[1:18:07] life is right now that I've known y'all

[1:22:20] give up something they didn't like well

[1:22:24] Lynch supposed to be giving up something
[1:22:26] that you like you know something that's
[1:22:27] that's going to be a uh you know
[1:22:29] something that's going to really hurt to
[1:22:31] give it up

[1:22:35] have Lent
[1:22:36] he wants to give us the word of God and
[1:22:39] he has given us a word of God and you
[1:22:41] know what you can make it
[1:22:43] where it's bitter in your belly

[1:22:52] John said sweet in my mouth sour my
[1:22:54] belly but you know what it didn't kill
[1:22:56] John
