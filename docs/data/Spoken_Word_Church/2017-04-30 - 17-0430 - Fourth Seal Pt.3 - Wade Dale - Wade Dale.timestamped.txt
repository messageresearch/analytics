[0:01] but I did we're going to be
[0:05] um going to be getting out of here but
[0:08] 15 after so we'll uh go and get started
[0:12] so everybody have a good week I
[0:15] hope all
[0:17] rejuvenated and ready to
[0:20] go
[0:23] [Applause]
[0:24] yesterday welcome to
[0:28] Georgia Georgia weather supposed to be
[0:30] 70 tomorrow I think so it's not going to
[0:32] be too bad thunder
[0:34] showers thank the Lord for the rain
[0:36] we've been
[0:37] getting everything green and growing
[0:39] which is a lot better than was last year
[0:42] all right let's um let's go and get
[0:44] started I said last Sunday when we
[0:45] finished that we would start now this is
[0:47] the fourth
[0:48] seal part three and keeping our mind
[0:51] that the Rapture takes place when this
[0:54] seal breaks the Rapture takes place okay
[0:57] when you when you break when the four
[0:59] seal breaks you go into the fifth seal
[1:02] then the bride in between that time is
[1:05] gone right cuz she's not
[1:08] here she's it's what you got to see
[1:11] we're not here when any of the physical
[1:13] seals open physical okay but we are here
[1:18] spiritually we're in that lap over time
[1:20] right the seals have a lap over too they
[1:23] sure one abruptly ends but you got to
[1:25] remember though that that the white
[1:27] horse rider the Antichrist started
[1:30] riding back in the first church age and
[1:33] they continue riding right on through
[1:35] and it's
[1:36] manifested in a crowned
[1:40] Pope Antichrist at the end so so they
[1:45] don't stop it just continue going but
[1:47] there is a there is an ending but
[1:50] remember the ending of one is the
[1:52] beginning of another right and then you
[1:55] take the Seven Seals which has to happen
[1:58] in time because seven is completion but
[2:00] seven is also a Time number we have to
[2:04] see that and see that's why this the way
[2:08] the Bible is like brother Chris was
[2:10] talking about last Sunday it's just you
[2:12] know we think we're getting all the
[2:13] Revelation now we're just
[2:15] getting right we're just getting enough
[2:18] to squeeze us into a body change and
[2:20] squeeze us into the into the future home
[2:22] but after that the full the full opening
[2:26] of the word okay cuz I mean this is all
[2:29] we have base this is what we base an
[2:32] eternity off of I was thinking about
[2:34] that um last night for this afternoon
[2:37] but what we get here is just it's just
[2:41] we're just watering what we got
[2:43] here because we have a limited listen
[2:46] you know as well as I do like I said 15
[2:48] minutes worth of sermon is all you get
[2:50] don't tell me your mind don't
[2:52] wander most of you fall asleep and you
[2:56] cannot listen while you're sleeping so
[2:59] but
[3:00] but what you do is you get your 10 or 15
[3:02] minutes you get something from God and
[3:04] you go on well see what when we get to
[3:06] the Future
[3:07] home your your mind is unlimited right
[3:11] you're a God yourself that's true
[3:13] brother Brown said you got enough in you
[3:15] now to go create a world and go live on
[3:18] it which means time tra you can travel
[3:19] through time to this
[3:22] um world that you created and you can go
[3:25] live on it so we think we're and we are
[3:27] we are at the Apex of Revelation time
[3:30] that's right okay right I was thinking
[3:33] the reason I was thinking I'm going to
[3:34] go back and do a series on the fall
[3:36] because before the
[3:38] fall before the fall listen now Adam the
[3:41] Bible says Adam was the son of
[3:43] God right that's right and that Eve was
[3:47] not another creation she's a
[3:49] continuation aren't we brother Brown
[3:52] said we are the continuation of that
[3:54] creation Eve was the continue if if Eve
[3:57] had not come into being Adam would not
[3:59] in full because remember when God took a
[4:02] rib out put it in the put it in the or
[4:05] made
[4:06] Eve what was their
[4:09] name no it was not their name was
[4:15] Adam Adam so she was a
[4:17] continuation listen if we're the Omega
[4:20] Eve we got Alpha Eve and Omega Eve which
[4:23] you got Alpha and om got the beginning
[4:25] when you come to Eve now remember that
[4:26] was done before the fall
[4:30] amen so we're a continuation of that
[4:33] creation Now Well Eve was absolutely a
[4:35] continuation of the creation of Adam
[4:38] remember God didn't take another piece
[4:39] of dirt that's what I like what brother
[4:42] Chris he didn't take another piece of
[4:43] dirt we've heard that 100 times but then
[4:45] you get that and you get that Revelation
[4:46] that she was a continuation of the
[4:49] creation she wasn't
[4:51] another
[4:53] form individual that's right right she
[4:56] was Adam that's right until to fall she
[5:00] was Adam she was Adam made manifest in
[5:02] another form okay and then she got the
[5:05] name Eve all right so so here we are in
[5:08] the end time and we're Another We're Not
[5:10] Another yeah we are another creation she
[5:12] was another creation but she wasn't God
[5:15] didn't take a lump of dirt and make her
[5:17] out of it right it was a continuation of
[5:20] the creation of Adam everybody
[5:22] understand that i' never seen it that
[5:23] well until till last Sunday she's a and
[5:26] he never say anything about that but you
[5:27] get to thinking when you start thinking
[5:29] about those things yes she's a
[5:30] continuation of the creation of God
[5:33] right amen all right so that's what
[5:34] we're looking at here we're looking at
[5:36] these seals and we're you're there's
[5:38] certain things that we get certain
[5:39] things we don't get that's true um
[5:42] there's time elements that we are going
[5:45] to get some of this and some of this
[5:46] we're not going to
[5:48] get you got a natural
[5:52] happening natural this is a natural
[5:55] happening right cuz look false Christ
[5:57] shall rise and shall deceive many that's
[5:58] a natural happening that's happening now
[6:01] right right the white horse rider is
[6:03] riding now through the church ages as a
[6:07] false anointing all the way up to the
[6:10] end time all right so same thing here
[6:13] now but we have to get to go back and
[6:14] get the spiritual aspect of the whole
[6:16] thing like I said about the fifth you're
[6:19] going to see this more in the fifth
[6:20] sixth and seventh seal because in the
[6:22] fifth and sixth seal we definitely are
[6:24] not here when that
[6:26] happens
[6:28] physically and and spiritually we're not
[6:31] here when the fifth and sixth seal opens
[6:33] right but we have to have the
[6:36] understanding of
[6:37] Revelation of that
[6:40] seal five and six we have to have that
[6:42] revelation of that before we can
[6:45] continue on to a body change okay but
[6:49] the natural happening is in the future
[6:52] right most of
[6:55] Revelation now if Revelations 41 excuse
[6:59] me
[7:00] context flipping over Revelations 4:1 to
[7:03] Revelations 19 is not to us and we're
[7:06] not here when it happens okay that's
[7:08] what the prophet of God said that's
[7:09] right then the greatest part of re or
[7:12] the biggest part of Revelation is
[7:14] happening when we're not here but we
[7:16] have to get the spiritual part of that
[7:19] the spiritual Revelation you can't te
[7:22] brother didn't say take Revelations five
[7:25] cuz man why take Revelations 5 out of
[7:27] the Bible that's the most Sublime
[7:28] scripture in the Bible he said you can't
[7:30] take five out of the Bible but you have
[7:32] to have understanding that we're not
[7:34] here during that period of
[7:38] time this is not here yes cuz remember
[7:42] in back what we're going to talk about
[7:43] the fall back before back before the
[7:45] fall look brother B said Adam LED or
[7:49] rule the world just like the Holy Ghost
[7:52] now does the Holy Ghost have
[7:55] limitation So Adam had no limitation
[7:58] that's what I mean there's two people in
[8:00] the Bible that to me is
[8:04] a I don't know if I could live that way
[8:07] would have been Adam and
[8:10] Noah Noah was before the flood right he
[8:13] saw All That civilization Before the
[8:15] Flood he lived 120 something year or
[8:18] more than that couple hundred years
[8:20] before the flood he walks out of that
[8:22] boat and everything's destroyed right
[8:24] he's got to start all over again Adam
[8:27] the same way Adam tree mooved this you
[8:29] know go here do that move this push this
[8:31] over here animals you do this now look
[8:34] God doesn't have to do it and Adam
[8:36] didn't have to stand there and go now
[8:37] elephant I want you to eat I want you to
[8:40] eat right over there I want you no it
[8:43] was led by the spirit of God Amen it was
[8:46] led by the spirit of God and Adam was
[8:49] led by the spirit of God to do the
[8:51] things he did and then all of a sudden
[8:53] when he comes down to the other side of
[8:54] the Fall he
[8:56] loses he loses all that power now I
[8:59] don't think he lost it abruptly I think
[9:01] he gradually lost it but how do you
[9:02] think Adam had to be a doctor cuz
[9:05] remember there was nothing nothing to be
[9:07] sick before the fall
[9:10] that's but there was something in Adam
[9:13] now he wasn't the Healer he wasn't God
[9:15] allight Amen but he was close he was a
[9:17] Son of God to and when he comes over
[9:20] into the fall and he starts having to
[9:22] deliver the
[9:23] babies take care of the sick bury the
[9:26] dead now he never had to do that all
[9:27] them ever how many millions or hundreds
[9:29] of thousands of years that was before
[9:31] that so he had a a culture shock right
[9:35] he had eat and never got sick now I
[9:37] can't say Adam wasn't sick forever how
[9:40] long he lives 900 and something years he
[9:42] wasn't you can't say he wasn't sick he
[9:44] had to become sick cuz he died right
[9:47] right so you see what I'm saying about
[9:48] Adam you know he's standing there
[9:50] controlling the whole world and then all
[9:52] of a sudden that leaves
[9:55] him you know Jesus on the cross you know
[9:58] he had that anointing on and then when
[9:59] the anointing left him he said my God my
[10:01] God why has Thou forsaken me amen if he
[10:04] was the second Adam then the first Adam
[10:05] didn't get crucified but he did take on
[10:08] what the sin of Eve that's right amen
[10:11] not the natural act but he took the the
[10:15] type is he took Eve to keep God from
[10:18] killing her cuz basically that's the way
[10:20] you and I are to keep God from killing
[10:23] me and you we had to have an advocate we
[10:24] had to have a husband that stood in our
[10:27] place right not some sex sexual act
[10:29] that's a bunch of garbage right I mean
[10:31] that's just really perverted
[10:34] really so anyway but it was the act of
[10:37] him not going Destroyer I'll get me
[10:39] another one right no why he knew where
[10:42] she came from Christ knows where we came
[10:46] from there's your predestination he knew
[10:49] where Eve came from and he knew Eve was
[10:51] an extension of him and without Eve he
[10:54] couldn't be complete without remember
[10:56] without Christ but brother Brown said
[10:59] Christ Miss gville he said without Eve
[11:01] or without the bride God is not complete
[11:04] that's all right so you see the two
[11:06] parallels uh here at the end time we're
[11:09] coming back to a place of uh in that
[11:11] know the three-fold purpose of the of
[11:13] the pull is is number one is the number
[11:16] three take her back to the Garden of
[11:17] eeden why cuz there was no sickness back
[11:20] then there was no sorrow there was no
[11:21] pain you
[11:23] know I believe Adam could travel like a
[11:27] thought why was why you going to put
[11:29] limitation on somebody that's that that
[11:31] come from that Genesis 126 man and had
[11:32] no limitation amen so you see now y'all
[11:36] don't have to come next Sunday so that's
[11:37] what we're going to talk about so now
[11:40] let's talk about the four seal but you
[11:41] got to remember the four seal when when
[11:43] we make a statement even when brother
[11:44] Dale makes a statement you have to take
[11:46] that statement and you have to analyze
[11:50] it right you have to analyze what's
[11:53] being said because if you don't just
[11:55] like I told y'all a couple of Sundays
[11:57] ago Paul got up and said we are
[12:00] resurrected right now think about that
[12:02] I'm I'm trying to put myself in Paul's
[12:03] Place he's in Athens and he's preaching
[12:05] to this big Coliseum of people and he's
[12:09] excited because God has given him a
[12:12] revelation that he has
[12:15] resurrected from within s already
[12:19] sitting in Heavenly places he has been
[12:21] caught up out of the age that he's in
[12:24] and he's preaching it so strong that two
[12:27] people in the back two preachers get
[12:30] their own Revelation that the r that the
[12:33] well the resurrection already happened
[12:36] well now that's totally impossible and
[12:39] Paul goes back and tries to explain he
[12:41] don't try he does he puts in the Bible
[12:43] he explains that but he turns Phil to I
[12:47] reckon they just keep preaching it and
[12:48] they don't pay him many attention cuz he
[12:49] turns them over to the devil remember
[12:51] for the destruction of the flesh
[12:54] so that's the way we must in this end
[12:57] time with so much l of
[13:00] Revelation and I mean layers of
[13:02] Revelation because you you if you apply
[13:04] it brother Brown just like brother Chris
[13:06] said good point I enjoyed his his
[13:08] preaching really enjoyed it but we got
[13:11] the picture right and I believe we're
[13:14] now getting the cow out of the tree
[13:16] that's right right putting him down here
[13:17] on the grass but now you've got all the
[13:19] elements that's right you got the grass
[13:22] right you got the seal that's right you
[13:24] got the tree okay you got the
[13:27] cow it's just somebody put the cow says
[13:30] Resurrection already happened they put
[13:32] the cow up in the top of the tree and
[13:33] Paul's trying to go no no no no no no
[13:35] we're resurrected s in Heavenly places
[13:37] cow goes down here where he eats grass
[13:39] all right so that's the same way I
[13:40] believe that the that the five-fold
[13:42] ministry is what is for the perfecting
[13:44] of the Saints what not to perfect
[13:49] you
[13:51] physically you got to be perfected
[13:53] spiritually and then that wer into the
[13:55] Physical Realm cuz remember your body
[13:57] cannot sin that's
[13:59] you sin in your spirit and your soul so
[14:03] why know always people would understand
[14:04] people um well I won't say anything
[14:07] online but but you get questions you
[14:09] know you got to go back to the basis are
[14:12] you born again or not if you're not born
[14:13] again you're in a whole different just
[14:15] like I said about the layer if you're
[14:17] not born again why worry about marriag
[14:20] and the that's right why worry about you
[14:24] know
[14:25] somebody watching this or not paying
[14:28] attention to me
[14:29] not do are you born again well no so
[14:33] you're just doing what the devil's told
[14:35] you to do that's true amen so that's the
[14:37] same way with these seals you're not
[14:39] going to understand your part unless you
[14:41] have the new birth that's true you're
[14:43] not going to understand and it's not
[14:45] your own Revelation but you do have to
[14:47] have your own
[14:48] Revelation amen CU that the sermon that
[14:52] brother Dale preaches the serm brother
[14:53] Chris
[14:55] preaches you're going to get your part
[14:57] and I may get another part that's true
[15:00] right all right and for those of you
[15:03] that are looking for Daddy's sermon on
[15:04] Wednesday night it's not there you you
[15:08] didn't get the email oh yeah YouTube
[15:12] pulled it off the oh yeah I did get that
[15:14] yeah okay YouTube pulled it
[15:16] off you have to watch your titles now
[15:19] when the title was examining yourself
[15:22] right well take that in a worldly sense
[15:25] so they took it in a worldly sense and
[15:26] pulled the sermon off the internet
[15:29] so if you're looking for it it's not
[15:31] there yet uh Joseph is disputing it
[15:35] but they put everything else on there
[15:37] but right the word of God they can't put
[15:40] on it's almost laughable but it's the
[15:42] devil I knew he'd get in there somewhere
[15:44] and cuz YouTube you know as well as I do
[15:48] YouTube is
[15:50] a Melting Pot of
[15:53] junk it's on our it will be on our
[15:56] website but it's not going to be on
[15:57] YouTube no we archive our stuff through
[16:00] YouTube right no it won't be on is right
[16:04] no but J is working on it so huh there's
[16:07] a raw file of it I'm sure yeah he's got
[16:10] the audio not yeah you get the audio but
[16:12] not the
[16:13] video but you see what we're coming up
[16:15] against we're coming up against demons
[16:17] in all different places you use a you
[16:20] use something and and Satan shuts it off
[16:24] so anyway so we have to watch our titles
[16:27] maybe a little bit word them a little a
[16:28] little bit different so that the world
[16:31] won't think we're talking about
[16:32] something else that's the same thing
[16:34] well that was the same thing what those
[16:35] two philus and hus they interpreted what
[16:37] they heard and you know what they must
[16:40] have preached lengthy sermons about it
[16:41] because Paul told them quit then he had
[16:44] to turn them over to the devil the Bible
[16:46] said so they must have not listen to
[16:49] Paul and it was absolutely just like
[16:50] Martin Luther was protesting the
[16:53] Catholic church and they were going down
[16:54] burning the churches and throwing the
[16:56] priest out in the yard you know
[17:00] you're we're doing what you said he said
[17:01] no that's not exactly what I said you
[17:04] know he said I want you to come out of
[17:05] that thing he said but don't burn the
[17:07] church down right you know the doctrine
[17:09] needs to be burned right not the
[17:12] building the doctrine needed to be
[17:14] burned I'd have looked better on them if
[17:16] they had to beat the priest instead of
[17:18] the
[17:19] building but that's where the doctrine
[17:21] came from but you see what we're doing
[17:23] with these seals though this is this why
[17:25] I'm stopping at number four because we
[17:27] must at at least get the part that you
[17:31] say that's for me because
[17:33] look you're not going to be hated of all
[17:36] Nations you personally cuz Russia don't
[17:39] know you that's
[17:41] true Canada all you see all Nation but
[17:46] what it is is when you come under the
[17:48] umbrella of the message of the hour the
[17:50] truth they hate the truth and if you're
[17:54] under that umbrella they're going to
[17:55] hate you too okay all right it's not
[17:57] going to be that all Syria hates me all
[18:01] Syria hates the word of God the syrians
[18:04] the one now we got some Believers in
[18:06] Syria they're under that same umbrella
[18:08] we are okay so we've
[18:11] got bride in every nation that God's
[18:14] going to that God's going to give a
[18:17] revelation and take in a Rapture but
[18:18] they're also going to be persecuted by
[18:20] their own Nation but now
[18:23] [Applause]
[18:24] look but you're going to be
[18:27] hated
[18:30] now remember Nations is not
[18:32] buildings Nations is people the people
[18:35] you going to be hated by this
[18:37] nation that's
[18:39] right okay you're going to be hated by
[18:41] this nation but you're not it's not
[18:43] going to be there's not a United States
[18:45] devil that's
[18:47] right there's a there may be in the
[18:49] United States demon right but they ain't
[18:51] the United States devil there's one
[18:53] devil and he wants this whole world to
[18:55] fall under his rule right cuz in that
[18:59] who then shall that's what I was
[19:00] thinking when then shall they who's
[19:05] they the riter of this for Feld okay
[19:10] okay cuz remember the Pale Horse is all
[19:13] the doctrines mixed together okay it's
[19:16] going to be now brother Brown said when
[19:18] the World Council of churches comes
[19:20] together the only
[19:22] thing I I was talking to a Baptist lady
[19:25] yesterday and she was she was saying how
[19:28] this Evangel IST was dating
[19:31] her
[19:33] cousin and I know her cousin's
[19:36] divorced I said now Lisa I said
[19:40] Baptist used to not put up with that she
[19:44] said well my preacher's not divorced and
[19:45] he's he's you know he's right I said
[19:48] well what about these and I and I
[19:49] brought another instance in the family
[19:52] that we are all aware of that somebody
[19:55] married somebody that was divorced she
[19:56] said well I guess that's okay and now
[19:59] I said it wasn't okay in the beginning
[20:01] why is it okay now see what I'm saying
[20:03] so they're softening up what I'm saying
[20:05] is they're sof and not the person she
[20:07] just hears it from the blit right the
[20:09] softening up of the people is going to
[20:11] take the Catholics and Protestants and
[20:12] put them back
[20:14] together for a short period of time but
[20:17] now I I believe though that when they
[20:19] get sucked into that the World Council
[20:21] of churches get sucked into that
[20:24] romanism remember that Pope's going to
[20:27] pop up in that six seal Pope's going to
[20:30] pop up and he's going to when we're gone
[20:33] he's going to what sign a treaty and
[20:35] then what's going to happen I believe at
[20:37] that time I believe that's when all the
[20:38] Protestants are going to realize what
[20:41] they' done cuz remember you got foolish
[20:43] virgins that's going to be through this
[20:45] three and 1/2 years of Ministry of the
[20:47] of the two prophets right that the
[20:49] Pope's going to Reign that or the
[20:52] Antichrist is going to rain but the
[20:54] battle of Armageddon brother Brown said
[20:55] was Protestants and Catholics so what
[20:57] happens is you're going to have
[20:59] a hierarchy of Catholicism and then
[21:01] you're going to have these people that
[21:02] have separated just like they did in
[21:03] Martin Luther's time but in Martin
[21:06] Luther's time there was other Church
[21:07] ages to come so God couldn't destroy
[21:09] everything then but now since the church
[21:12] ages are over since the Bible's
[21:15] been you know Jesus can't come back to
[21:17] the Jews listen to me Jesus can't come
[21:19] back to the Jews until Moses and Elijah
[21:22] preached 3 and 1/2 years okay there's no
[21:24] way he can come back to the Jews before
[21:26] then right so there's got to be that
[21:28] half year Ministry of the two prophets
[21:31] preaching Jesus Christ to the two w to
[21:34] the through the two witnesses to the
[21:36] 144,000 and then Christ can destroy the
[21:38] Earth he cannot destroy the Earth before
[21:41] then now sure we can get this
[21:43] pre-tribulation and all this stuff
[21:44] earthquakes in diverse places that's
[21:46] what it's telling us here and want hate
[21:48] each other and kill them and all this
[21:50] stuff many false prophets but you can't
[21:52] have that battle of Armageddon until
[21:54] that 144,000 God promised them 144,000
[21:59] there's going to go home right okay so
[22:01] that's you know like I said the
[22:03] resurrection is what's is what's barring
[22:07] us we we've come to a place I hope y'all
[22:09] see that we've come to a place to where
[22:11] the the Revelation has come to a place
[22:13] to to Resurrection is the next
[22:16] thing
[22:18] okay and you know what right in that
[22:20] little time there's going to be the
[22:21] third pool you know brother B said it's
[22:23] laying dormant now but right about the
[22:24] time they they come in and start
[22:26] clamping down on us then we'll need the
[22:28] third pool which will be the speaking of
[22:30] the word we'll need that little bit
[22:32] right before Christ comes and picks us
[22:35] up that's right but remember when he
[22:37] picks us up time's going to continue on
[22:39] brother Brown said people going think
[22:40] they're getting
[22:42] saved with all this horribleness going
[22:44] on they're still going to think they're
[22:45] getting saved during that time so it's
[22:47] going to be so secret till we're just
[22:50] going to vanish a such a small group
[22:53] we're just going to vanish but listen
[22:55] we're going to know that we're getting
[22:56] ready to go because when those dead when
[22:59] Robert Tatum walked through that door
[23:00] and and and brother Tom and and Gary and
[23:04] and Rich Marlo when they all start
[23:06] coming back into here we know that we
[23:09] fixing to go
[23:10] home we're fixing well actually we're
[23:12] not going home I'm telling you you got
[23:14] to remember our home is the future home
[23:17] this Earth is not our home in the
[23:18] Millennium that's right remember we're
[23:20] here on honeymoon now do you got a
[23:21] honeymoon on your at your house now some
[23:23] of you may have did after you got
[23:24] married but me and June we went to Gat P
[23:26] Forge okay we went some else for our
[23:29] honeymoon you know what we did we came
[23:31] home after the wedding was over after
[23:34] the honeymoon was over we came back home
[23:36] so that's what we're going to do we're
[23:37] not home home is the future home that's
[23:41] where our home is and that's after like
[23:44] I'm telling you we're a thousand and
[23:45] something years from that anybody got
[23:48] that so what I'm trying to say this
[23:50] whole thing is watch your layers of
[23:52] Revelation when somebody says something
[23:54] analyze it see whether it's for your
[23:56] time yes because look
[24:00] uh we're going to speak this afternoon
[24:02] on former lat
[24:03] rain you've got to get you've got to get
[24:06] under the water before you can get wet
[24:08] that's the rain won't do you any good if
[24:10] you're under a shed right take some of
[24:14] your plants and put them under the put
[24:15] them under your porch now you do before
[24:18] the frost but now if you got a real good
[24:20] spring rain and you just planted
[24:21] something you got them in pots is the
[24:23] first thing you do when it starts
[24:24] raining is run out there and put them
[24:25] under a shelter no you leave them out
[24:28] there let them get wet let the seed rot
[24:30] let it what blow up it's got to die when
[24:35] something dies remember when something
[24:37] dies like the prophet of God said it
[24:38] blows up okay so that's what we got to
[24:41] do in form a latter rain so we'll talk
[24:44] about that this
[24:46] afternoon but that's the same thing
[24:47] brother Brown taught us this the
[24:51] seal preached you know seven or eight
[24:54] nights a sermon okay then he he put it
[24:59] in bits and pieces all the way through
[25:00] till he went home like brother Dale said
[25:02] you watch you know you you see that
[25:03] brother Ram has come up to a place where
[25:06] he sees things more clear so he preaches
[25:08] these different things that he didn't
[25:10] preach the fullness of before the seals
[25:13] open why he had come to a level that he
[25:16] knew that number one he knew that God
[25:18] was working in his life
[25:20] yes I believe that I believe God he knew
[25:23] God was working in his life so much to
[25:25] what he said was going to come to pass
[25:27] he was a prophet he was prophesying
[25:29] right that's right so let's read this
[25:31] right here and then we'll we got to go
[25:32] upstairs in a minute then shall they
[25:34] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[25:36] kill you and you shall be hated of all
[25:39] Nations for my name's sake then shall
[25:41] many be offended and shall betray one
[25:44] another and shall hate one another now
[25:46] look at this this is going to happen
[25:48] right before the
[25:51] Rapture CU remember the Rapture happens
[25:53] on the for Cale then shall many be
[25:56] offended and shall betray one another is
[25:58] that not what's happening now yes in the
[26:00] ranks of the message that's
[26:02] right and hate one another listen there
[26:05] people in this message that
[26:08] hate me for one brother Dale they'll
[26:12] hate you they hate us why they hate
[26:17] somebody je us they just don't have a
[26:20] true Revelation okay I'm not saying that
[26:22] they're not born again but I don't think
[26:24] Hate's over here in the pyramid anywhere
[26:26] that's okay
[26:29] then shall many be offended and shall
[26:31] betray one another and look at what the
[26:33] people are doing the people now the
[26:36] message preachers it's not the people
[26:39] either people left and come look at this
[26:42] church even since I've been back since
[26:44] 1998 these people come and left come and
[26:47] left come and left but look at all the
[26:50] preachers now that are coming and
[26:52] leaving and leaving and leaving and
[26:53] leaving and just leaving
[26:56] congregations right we know know that
[26:58] just leaving congregation just I'm not
[27:01] preaching no more I'm leaving well
[27:02] you're betraying the people that's right
[27:05] you're betraying your office number one
[27:08] but you're betraying the
[27:10] people you think you're going to get
[27:12] hurt no the people are going to get hurt
[27:15] and then that's going to
[27:17] cause people to hate each other yes many
[27:20] false prophets shall rise and shall
[27:22] deceive many you look
[27:24] now now I of course like I said I don't
[27:28] I don't watch preachers on the internet
[27:31] I used to a long time ago I don't
[27:33] anymore but if you look now that things
[27:37] have kind of been quiet there's not a
[27:39] lot of false Doctrine now we know it's
[27:42] still out there but they're not pounding
[27:43] it hard like they used to pound it
[27:46] that's right like the the son of man and
[27:48] like the River Jordan and all you know
[27:50] the one preacher that kept preaching it
[27:53] it's kind of laying a little bit but
[27:55] what's happening they're leaving
[27:58] they're going completely away from the
[28:00] message not just keeping their false
[28:02] Doctrine they're just
[28:03] completely cuz they're being deceived
[28:07] and you know they tell me that somebody
[28:10] that's really depressed just can't see
[28:13] tomorrow right you can't see a positive
[28:15] tomorrow can't
[28:17] see why even live tomorrow to me that's
[28:20] when you get deep dark depression it say
[28:22] a misy is when you know it ain't going
[28:24] to get no better and tomorrow ain't
[28:25] going to get no better and the next day
[28:26] ain't going to get no better so I'm not
[28:27] going to get no
[28:30] better well that's what the people in
[28:32] this message the the poor people in this
[28:34] message the problem is is they're not
[28:36] sitting under a progressive now some are
[28:39] sitting under a progressive to where
[28:40] that everything kind of and you know
[28:43] what it may not go but I was thinking
[28:44] the another day that right there by
[28:47] itself is real thin you can't hardly
[28:49] that wouldn't that wouldn't bother you I
[28:51] mean you know see how thin that
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] is but you put 50 of these together
[28:58] together and it's about that tall M you
[29:00] put a 100 of these together it's about
[29:02] that tall so it's really not
[29:04] the it's the once it PP starts piling up
[29:08] you got what I'm saying we know it's the
[29:11] little foxes that spil the vine but what
[29:13] do them little foxes do they grow up to
[29:14] be big boxes that's right so what what
[29:16] I'm saying is that people are letting
[29:19] false Doctrine intimidate them and say
[29:22] well if this is all the messages is I
[29:24] don't want any if this is all they got
[29:27] you know don't see an end but but I in
[29:30] this in the excuse me in the seals I see
[29:33] an end yes brother R said the Seven
[29:36] Seals the end of the struggling world
[29:39] right the end of all those things that's
[29:40] the end
[29:41] right if the Seven Seals Reve to you
[29:44] then then the struggling end of the
[29:45] struggling world you're done with this
[29:46] struggling world that's right sure we're
[29:48] in this world we have things we have to
[29:50] do but yes but if it bothers you so bad
[29:53] you will go crazy that's right but if
[29:56] you just say you know you're in the
[29:58] hands of God
[30:00] right make sure you're Mak sure you're
[30:02] born again sitting where you can hear
[30:04] the word of God and then apply the word
[30:06] of God to me other than that I don't get
[30:09] involved in the little frivolous things
[30:11] but we need a revelation of this seal
[30:13] because we got to come to this ceiling
[30:15] and we going home that's true okay so
[30:17] just think about that till next Sunday
