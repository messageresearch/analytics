every one of you you know we can get gifts but it's not a better gift than that than the person than The Giver you see I can I can have the gift you know but but it's better the gift is supposed to always remember remind me of The Giver so sometimes we just get the gift and that's it but we get the gift it should always remind us of The Giver amen so we just we just appreciate brother Dale appreciate sister Peggy thank you for for a good time we had Sunday and uh just a quick uh announcement I just wanted to uh to mention to you all you all remember us in your prayers uh uh we're we're going to be heading out for Nicaragua on January 11th through the 23rd so we'll be there about two weeks and it'll only be Nicaragua this time just one country last time it was three countries and it is only it'd only be for two weeks not seven and a half weeks like last time but during this time uh frame the the the the the Youth Camp that is usually held uh by byc um that brother Mike Siebert started back back in the 60s 70s I believe it was and they do have a similar Youth Camp down in in Nicaragua and he started that back in the 90s I believe and so we're going to be we're going to be there during that time and this time I'm going to take uh we're gonna have brother Bob black with us so and I I'm thoroughly looking forward to it as I know he is and this will be his I guess this will be your first mission trip right so I figure he got his passport might as well take him out you get him to do something I told the brothers down there uh that you know I believe that the people down there will benefit from his ministry as well and so we're not going to just be part of the youth campus there we're also going to minister into the bride of Christ and and other churches around the area as well and uh and I'll be his interpreter so I'll be preaching along with him but I won't be preaching but uh uh so you just pray for us we're also going to take a few of the youth from here Nyla is going to be going with us uh Michael Michael benungwe he's going to be going with us and uh I believe that's it from here uh yeah well my daughters they're they're going on obviously and then there's uh there's there's a uh Sister Jordan from Texas she's gonna be gone so she's gonna be coming as well and so we're looking to have a good time and I believe it'll be a good experience for for the for the Youth as well I'd say if you can go out of the country at least one time you're in life and not to just vacation or go on a cruise but actually live with the people it'll change your life it'll make you see things much different it'll make you appreciate what you have and so that's that's kind of what what one of the the hopes of this trip is so you remember us in your prayers as we'll be doing that also remember me in your prayers I'll I'll be speaking in South Carolina on on the 18th so for brother Gene Williams he he messaged me today and I told him that should be fine so I'm waiting for his reply so you remember us in your prayers as well for that if you have your Bibles this evening let's turn to Second Timothy chapter three I appreciate your patience second Timothy chapter three I wanna I wanna I know that maybe we've heard these questions before but and if the brothers back there uh um I'll just what I'll do they're listening out what I'll do is I'll just uh I'll just use my phone just to show the video and the in the in the images so um so they can pull up the scriptures but I know that that in dealing with people we always um we always have to deal with these questions and and you know and a lot of our youth they're having to deal with these questions you know the the more and more uh everything's becoming more secularized and and the youth are the people are are being led to believe more in science than the word of God there's even there's even uh there's a there's a there's a theme or there's a almost like a religion it's called scientism and it's it's the it's the it's where if science can't prove it then it doesn't exist and it doesn't it's not reality and sometimes us as Christians we tend to almost believe more in science than we do word of God the word of God tells us something and it clearly directly says something but yet because NASA said something or you know we kind of just lean more towards NASA because they know better than God hmm that's kind of the attitude that we take sometimes or or you can have not just be nasty because the government said so they know more than God because we're in advance we've Advanced more than God but I you know what I'd rather stay with the word of God because the word of God is God's breathed God breathed his word amen and he knew the beginning from the end NASA Only Knows up to a certain point the government knows up to a certain point but God knows for through all eternity amen so so here's a dilemma there are our our people the people have today is can we trust a book that is written by man how do I know that it's even true how do I know that the Bible is true how do you know that the Bible is true why are we so consumed with the word of God that that that that that that it you know we we believe that it's the word of God and what's so special about the Bible from any other book that you might find in the library so we want to talk about that this distance this evening let's read second Timothy chapter 3 verse 10. it says here but thou has fully known my Doctrine this is Paul Paul speaking to to Timothy a young man a young man he was a young man but thou has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium at lystra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me now I'm sure we can all say the same thing too yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus will have a flowery bed of ease that doesn't say that does it shall suffer persecution shall suffer persecution but evil man and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but watch what he says here but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them and and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus so Paul here is saying that these scriptures will make you wise but they can't they can only work only if you have faith in them as well without faith you can't the scripture can't help you all scripture this is the scripture I want to say all scripture all is given by inspiration of God and this profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works praise the Lord Jesus let's just borrow our heads our heavenly father we just thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word we ask that you would forgive us first of all Lord for our sins any iniquities Lord God cleanse his father for sometimes we we get out of Step Lord we Heir father in the way Lord through our thoughts through with the things we do the things we say we ask you father for forgiveness now Lord we pray Lord that you would cleanse us father from all unrighteousness and we ask that you would just help us here tonight Lord as we Endeavor to just open back the pages of your word and just look at this hear father God of the assurance that you've given us through your through your scriptures Lord God help us father to leave here edified and you glorified Lord for we ask these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated amen brother Branham States here in in in in Satan's Eden he's he says this he says that all that's all I know to tell you that this Bible I believe with all my heart if I know my heart to be the perfect unadulterated word of God goodness what a tongue twister there by this I live by this I stand and if I had ten thousand lives so what he says here if I had ten thousand lives in other words if he could live over ten thousand times I'd like to give every bit of it for this word for it's the word of Jesus Christ and I don't care how much they can try to disprove it how much science tries to say it isn't trustworthy and so forth to me it's the only thing in the world I can trust it's this word amen he is mine I love him don't you praise the Lord so there's nothing better that we could put our bank our souls on and in some places brother Baron says where I can Bank my soul on but the word of God the word of God doesn't change his mind God doesn't say one thing at one place and then later on he changes his mind what it says is exactly what it means do you really believe that so sometimes we try to explain something away well it didn't mean that way exactly because see science now tells us I don't think so it means exactly what it says praise the Lord Jesus second Peter 1 16 tells us this it says for we have not followed cunningly devised Fables when we made known unto you this is Peter talking now Peter was an eyewitness of what happened in the life of Jesus so he knew first account he saw the things that he was talking about so he knew what he was talking about but he says here for we have not followed cunningly devised fables in other words stories amen when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty you know what Peter Peter was I mean he he went through it all with the life of Jesus he went through the good times with Jesus he went through bad times with Jesus and he went through good and bad times without Jesus I mean just a man that that came to a point where he denied Jesus three times fulfilling what Jesus had said to him directly that that's what you were going to do and he said I won't do it and he did it and he kept he ca he that followed I'm sure followed him all the rest of his life but you know what Jesus never rubbed that in his face he just said you're just you just fulfilled what I told you you fulfilled my word so so what a wonderful thing and Peter here is a witness for he says here for he received from God the father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased this is talking about Jesus and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy mount we also we have also a more sure word of Prophecy what he says here we have also a more sure word of Prophecy now you say you might you might you might think well the the New Testament I don't know if I can if I can trust it and I don't even know if I could trust the Old Testament but Jesus trusted the Old Testament enough because part really he quoted it many many times so if you can't believe Jesus then you really don't believe the Old Testament either because because for one Jesus is the word that went through the Old Testament right and then here he is in the form of the Holy Spirit speaking through these men here in the New Testament so it's Jesus Christ from Genesis to revelation amen we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye do well watch that you do what you do well that ye take heed in other words you listen and you and you you and you you listen to it as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star rise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture let me say that again that no Prophecy of the scripture No No scripture or no Bible verse is of any private interpretation what does that mean it means that it didn't come privately or somebody just thought of just writing that no somebody lived it out and then it happened and somebody penned it out and we're going to take a look here at some things as to what will help you to know why can I trust the scriptures why can I trust the Bible for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man so it wasn't it no man ever thought about the word of God the way it's written right nobody ever found the word of God hidden under a rock somewhere and say well we're just going to publish this book we found another book never because too many I mean the word of God has changed lives and there the fact that that it causes people to die for this word something is something is taking place I mean there was thousands millions of people that are actually willing to give up their life they weren't just dragged to to the to the Stables or to the crosses to get hung they willingly walked in there and said for this I die for this I stand just as brother Brandon was saying the question is are you willing to do that or will something happen or take place or come to your life that would want to make you not even stand for this word the way you should my father prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy man of God's spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen now these are these are eyewitness accounts of the life of Jesus this is Luke right here uh in Luke chapter one and I'm just kind of putting this as a foundation I'm I'll read a little quicker and comment less Luke 1 1-4 says for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth an order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed Among Us so they believed these things even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word it seemed good to me also haven't had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus that thou mightest know this is why he's writing that that Luke was writing his biography I said biography or of Jesus right that thou what was it biography that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou has been instructed amen so Luke wasn't one of the disciples he he wasn't probably there like maybe Peter was the whole time amen so how did Luke get all of these things amen must have been that the Holy Spirit was at work because the Holy Spirit knows all things amen and the Holy Spirit is that word which is Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Jesus so so let's look here at some at some at some history here now the word bible it comes from the Latin word which is Biblia Biblia and that's actually the Spanish word for Bible that's why it's easy for me to remember that comes from the Latin word bible which means a collection of books that's what that word means so that's where we get the word bibliotech which is a library right we use biblioteca in Spanish and so that that that's the word bible now ask this question why why should I trust the Bible why should I trust the Bible young people I know that sometimes the Devil comes and he comes to you directly and says why you've been in you've been going to church and listening to the to the word of God the message you listen to all this why should I even trust it isn't it just like any other book that's written out there isn't it just what is it what if some man just just happened to just just just start making things up and just writing things down let's change too many lives for that to just been just by coincidence and it's still changing lives amen there has never been one person that that that has never been exposed to the word of God that hasn't had some sort of change either for the positive or the negative the word of God changes amen because listen if you if you accept the word it'll be a blessing to you if you reject the word it'll become a curse to you amen so either way it's going to have an effect on you amen tell me what book in in this world can do that Edgar Allan's Poe's writings that they ever do anything like that no they make you scared and they make you think of a man who man that that dude is a is a freak have you ever read after Allen's post stuff I mean it's we used to read the things in in in in uh in high school they would make us write read those things and write something about it it was something weird in that dude's mind but they glorify Edgar Allan Poe like he's just this great thing and then you talk about Jesus Christ and his word ah we don't know about that hey girl and Poe is much more popular than than Jesus amen the writings of Plato the writings of of of all these different uh you know you look at those writings and and and and and and they're they seem to be more popular than than Jesus on the surface but the Bible has been the most uh sold book that there ever has has been right so so why should I trust the Bible well for one there's archaeological evidence Genesis and an exodus there's archaeological evidence of the things that was said people have gone back and actually have seen what the Bible talks about I can think of Sodom and Gomorrah Sodom and Gomorrah right there exactly the way the Bible talks about it they that you can go over there and actually pick up the sulfur balls and the things that fell from you might have to dig them out a little bit but there's videos on YouTube you can go look and people set fire to them and everything sulfur balls get I can't even talk tonight sulfur balls get there in the scripture amen exactly didn't what happened there didn't happen you know it was said in the scripture as I said it's the best-selling book of all time um another example is that you know the Red Sea Crossing I don't know if you there's there's there's documentaries where they've actually found the possible places where where the the children of Israel have crossed and they've actually have found like chariot wheels and things right there at the bottom of the ocean so I mean how did that get there you see so so it's just it's like I said it's not just a book that somebody just just happened to just find and they're a Rock Amen amen but it's something that's actually changing lives if you take it to heart if you have faith in it praise the Lord now here's here's one thing that you can you can look at with regards to the word of God and it's the honesty test the honesty test now the writers of the of the of the Bible if if they wanted to lie if they wanted to say just make up all these things and say just all kinds of lies to you why not just say beautiful things and nice things about themselves the whole time no instead we find Moses who is one of the writers of the Bible writing things about himself that you probably would not even mentioned about about about yourself remember he wrote the first I believe it was the first five books of the of the Bible and and there you'll find where where Moses he wrote where he was supposed to speak to the Rock instead he got upset and struck The Rock and because of that he was not able to go into the Promised Land Exodus I believe is Exodus that tells us about that who wrote that Moses himself so he wrote something negative about himself you take for example uh uh uh uh let's see uh when the John you know when when he was when when he was talking about that the disciples were arguing with each other about who's the greatest in the Kingdom they were fussing with each other about who's the greatest in the Kingdom but that's there for our our benefit right but they would write negative things about their experiences as well look at Paul he wrote about himself going and persecuting the Christians and killing them what good writer I mean what writer would write things about himself that way I mean I would just write just nice flowery things I mean just the way people do it on Facebook nowadays they show a a a a a an image of yourself that it's really not you all right but these these writers of the word didn't write just flowery beautiful things about themselves or their experiences they wrote negative things as well amen so that is one of the reasons why you can trust the word of God because these writers were honest about their experiences about the things that they went through I just didn't I just didn't see Miracles I also failed the Lord Jesus I did not the Lord Jesus three times can you imagine the shame and we never find Peter where he rebuked any of the writers of of the four gospels and told him don't write that about me don't put that in there don't put that in there no he let them amen amen because that's God inspired see Peter didn't understand me that he was doing that but it was to be written for our benefit today and so sometimes Saints you might find why am I why why have I am I in this situation I have fallen in this situation I'm in this situation but God might use that for a benefit for somebody else later on Peter's downfall Peter's uh uh occasion of of of that caused him to cry it became a blessing to you and me amen if we make a mistake Jesus won't rub it in our face amen he's willing to forgive praise the Lord and we could look through all the scriptures Hosea he wrote about himself what did Hosea do Hosea wrote about himself asking God asked him to marry a prostitute man that's in the Bible yeah now there was a purpose for that you just go back in the Bible and read it but he wrote that about himself about his experience amen praise the Lord amen and then of course Paul persecuted the Christians and all these men they gave their time and their lives for the faith of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Jesus and in looking at some of for example the the way the the the disciples some of the disciples the way they died some of them died horrible deaths think about it Peter was crucified it was crucified and he told them don't crucify me the way my Lord was crucified he said crucify me upside down that's how that's how much he was willing to die and if they were telling lies why not just recant right there and say oh no I don't believe this God this Jesus and I don't want to you know they were willing to die for it they were willing to die so if there's you could go back and read the Histories on on on the disciples on the way they die I believe the only one that died of old age or natural was John was John I think he died was like 90 something years old all the other ones they were they were persecuted they were they were they were they died horrible deaths so to me Saints that tells me amen that these Arthur these authors of the Bible these authors of this of the gospels they were more concerned about truth than they were about themselves they were more concerned about giving you the truth than they were about their own even their own lives so young people that's the one of the reasons why you can't trust the word of God don't Satan comes around saying that's just a man's book you you get no it's it's the word inspired breathed out word of God praise the Lord Jesus all right there's another test that we can we can look at and and that is that is what it's called the time Gap test and it's the time for when when the author wrote the original manuscript to the time of a copy of that manuscript was written amen so when the Bible was written let's say let's just think about the The Book of Luke when the Book of Luke was written to the time that it was written until the time that there was a copy of that manuscript amen there wasn't but Pro less than 50 years that had took place because remember when some back then when they would copy things it wasn't through text message and it wasn't through email it was handwritten somebody had to look at the original manuscripts and to make copies of the of the manuscripts of the Bible they had to sit there and pen that manually so if you let a lot of time pass by from the time that the original manuscript took place was written to the time that a copy came to be written if there's a lot is there if there's a great wide Gap there then there's things that are going to be missing there's things that are allowable to be missing but the word of God is in that that way it's about less than 50 years amen that from the time that let's just say the Book of Luke that that the the manuscript of the gospels was was written the copies of it was written then yeah right it's kind of it's kind of interesting too that the message of the hour the message that God's given us you see how quickly it was transcribed it wasn't transcribed now my wife she knows all about transcription because that's what she does it's not an easy job if you think that sitting there listening and and typing especially listening to brother Brandon is is tough and I'm just thankful for these Brethren that took their time to do that these sisters that do that that we can now read the message and not just not just here amen praise the Lord so but but during that time that the message was was was was was you know brother Branham preached the message it wasn't too long after that that it was put put in text in text amen now you can look here for example there was a Roman historian by the name of Pliny the Younger the time Gap from when he wrote his manuscripts to the copies that that we have now 750 years passed but he's an authority he's he's a popular historian the time Gap that we have of Caesar's writings to now to the to the manuscripts that of his original writings to the to the copies is a thousand years that had passed Plato's time gap of his writings is 1200 years and then Alexander the greats time Gap is 400 years but the Bibles was less than 50 years but we say well these men existed Alexander the Great existed Plato and all these men they they existed but I don't know about Jesus I don't know about him you see how the devil works I don't know if we can trust what he said you know but we'll read Plato and Alexander the Great and and and all these all these men all day long praise the Lord amen they no nobody questions these historical figures existence but but when it comes to Jesus he's he's questioned whether he existed or not amen praise God now another test that we can do is how many manuscripts are available all you know about Caesar is that only 10 there's only 10 manuscripts of his writings all right I know this is kind of just bear with me okay we're getting to something we're getting to something oh there's only about 10 manuscripts of his writing about Plato's it's about seven manuscripts of his writings hey man there's a there was a Roman historian by the name of tacitus he had 20 manuscripts guess how many manuscripts the Bible has and why don't I don't want to take a guess by the way twenty four thousand six hundred and thirty three manuscripts of the word there are available and the number keeps going up right the second most manuscripts there are available out there for any book is the is The Iliad written by Homer and and that has only 643 manuscripts that that is a difference of 23 990. the Bible has many more manuscripts so these manuscripts and and these things have been passed down from the and God has guarded these things so that we can enjoy it today in in this book form so that we can enjoy it today in even in tablet form praise God amen so you don't tell me that Jesus Christ is not more popular than Homer [Laughter] I I I can't nobody died for Homer but somebody died for Jesus Christ amen throughout throughout time and then there's another there's another thing that you can look at is the corroboration test do what are there other historical materials or writings that corroborate or deny the testimony of the Bible and in looking into this there's there are nine non-Christian sources and 33 Christian sources that mention Jesus within 150 years of his death so there's other sources outside of the Bible that mention Jesus and his life all right so there's about 42 known sources that we know that Tiberius Caesar and the Roman Emperor at the time of Jesus lived he had only 10 sources that mention him within the 150 years of his life amen but we say he's more real than Jesus is no I don't think so Jesus hadn't he had more four times more resources amen so we know that outside of the Bible that Jesus lived performed Miracles and that people believed on him outside of the Bible there's there's cooperation of that now let's have let me ask you this question why is the Bible in letter form [Music] why can't Jesus why can't the Lord just given it to us in video format from the beginning why couldn't he just give it to us in images GIFs animated gifs and we like to text with animated gifs nowadays why can't why can't they be in that way and I want to give you all an example so we got props today if the brothers could pull pull my phone up a bit on mine all right let's see okay all right here's this picture right here and I want someone to tell me who these people are can somebody just take a guess yes sir Mary and Joseph by looking at that picture you think Mary Joseph okay all right anybody else one Josh just whatever whatever comes to your mind that that is okay it says me and Sister Christine all right sister Anna Canard what do you think just uh just a a cup a couple okay a couple all right what if I told you that it's a brother and a sister named Tommy and Caitlin on a trip to Spain with each of their own families while each of their families were sightseeing Caitlyn asked Tommy's wife Andrea if she could take a picture of her and her brother since they don't have many pictures together and haven't taken one together in a long time so Andrea did let's just say if this was a picture now how do you know that's true there's got to be an element of Faith there now do you know that I that I looked at this picture and I'm the one who made that up because that's what I saw when I saw that picture but you see you took my word for it man that's why so sometimes we just have to take the word of God in that same way why is it that the Lord didn't give us the word of God in picture form because there will be all these different interpretations of what of what certain something is whereas in text you just saw that I could get details exactly of what that of what that was well what was in my mind and what we read in the word of God is what was in the mind of God you see hot why why it's so important to read God could have given us us to us in a different format but he chose to give it to us in text form because it could be in more details all right and it could also produce an image in your mind as you're reading right it transcends you to the to the place there's some places in the word of God that you're reading and it goes into details and it's almost like if you're there right praise the Lord I want to play this video right here I want you to tell me somebody tell me what they what what they think it is yeah there is a doggie underneath there all right Bella what do you think it is you no guess anybody want to take one guess just one guess brother Wade father and a daughter okay you got father and a daughter what if I told you that this was a brother and a sister sitting together at a park bench the sister is trying to comfort her brother as he talks to him because as he talks to her because he just lost his wife due to cancer a few weeks prior the sister understands what her brother is going through because she had lost her husband in a car accident and she was left a widow four years prior so you couldn't get all those details just watching that video you see what I'm saying but I just read you in text form or something I just made up but you you believed it right same thing with the word of God why that's why the word of God is so important that it's in text format amen all right and then here's picture number three I don't even know what that picture is yeah yeah I was giving Joe a massage that's what he does hahaha all right well hopefully I woke some of you up [Laughter] amen [Music] it definitely wasn't recent the Joe Joe looks a little younger there all right so does the point come across as to why reading the word of God is so important and why thank God that He gave it to us in text form amen now let's talk about the alive word amen why the alive word is still so relevant for us today amen second Timothy chapter 3 tells us this verse 16 oh we we just read it but we're ready to hear again all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works now we know that what makes perfect is the holy spirit amen but what the holy spirit is in his word amen he the word is is the Holy Ghost amen praise God he is his word Jesus said in one place my words are spirit and their life amen so as you receive the word as you read the word the text of the word and you're taking it in by faith then it can do something for you it's breathing life into you Amen in in in in in the NIV version this scripture says it this way it says all scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness and in the ESV version it says all scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching for reproof for Corrections and so forth so all scripture is God breathed which also explains the alive and active word of God Amen it's the alive and active word of God amen meaning that we can take a scripture the scriptures that were written back then during the time of Moses and we can apply it to our lives today we can bring that word all the way from Genesis and put it in some application here in 2022. tell me what book in in the world can do that a book that was written in the 1800s you would not be able to put everything and apply it to our day but the word of God you can amen because why again the word of God is God breathed is alive amen so it's active amen it's working it's changing it's moving God is always moving amen he's never stopping he never he he's never uh uh uh he never stops he's always in motion and that as he moves we move praise God now in thinking about this it takes me back to Genesis 2 7 where God breathed into Adam let's read that real quick and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul when you look at the at the uh the strongest concordance there the word breathe it means to breathe to blow amen and then where it talks about the breath the breath it's a puff it's the word uh nismat to breathe is the word and and the the breath the nisma a puff wind angry vital breath watch a divine inspiration amen what is the word of God all word of God is inspired amen at divine inspiration intellect an animal of life it's The Word Alive raw fresh strong life and then you take you take where it says there in Genesis 2 7 he became Adam became a living Soul a living is Haya and it's not Haya but it's Haya alive raw fresh strong life and then the word soul is nephesh what's this Soul self-life creature person appetite mind living being desire emotion passion that which breathes the breathing substance or being Soul the inner being of man amen so God actually breathed into him amen gave him his soul praise God in Genesis 2 7. praise the Lord now we're all created by God All Souls are mine says the Lord amen praise God that's your decision if you want that soul to either continue with God or be destroyed at some point in time in your life yeah how horrible it is to one day think that you you exist no more amen and that you can't enjoy the things that are coming Hereafter praise God now I want you to think about this because we see that the scripture amen it it it's inspired amen and and and and look at the difference amen the difference between Adam being alive and the living word amen now I want you to think about this Adam was dead when when God breathed into him I mean he wasn't he wasn't living it wasn't until God breathed into him that he became a living soul right but the scripture is not that way the scripture is alive as it comes out of God praise the Lord Jesus is not it's not dead word it's alive and it's a creative word amen it's not dead so when Paul was said was saying that all scripture was is inspired by God therein all scripture is given by inspiration of God he's not saying that if you read the word then get inspired then that's when the word of God becomes inspiring no the word of God from the beginning from the get-go is already inspired praise the Lord Jesus but now what that word is wanting to do is wanting to come in and and live and come into a vessel to become a Living Word through somebody it's already living it already has life it already can create but now it wants to come in and live itself through you and I through a vessel the best example I could give is probably when in Isaiah chapter 7. that it was prophesied Isaiah said that a virgin shall conceive that word came forth that word was alive when it came forth it just went years and years and that word was still alive it was inspired it was alive and it finally found a vessel that it can rest up in and it was Mary but it was a willing vessel it wasn't just any old good 16 year old girl that was living in Jerusalem or or where Mary lived at the time no it was a willing vessel that that word that was already inspired when it came out of God's mouth Amen to Isaiah and Isaiah penned it down amen it was already alive now we wanted to rest in Mary and Mary could say be it unto me according to Thy word praise the Lord Jesus according to Thy word not my word not my will but according to Thy Word Hallelujah amen praise the Lord Jesus so it's it's the word of God is alive and Powerful when God said let there be light amen it was so right amen it's an alive and active word when it comes forth out of the mouth of God that's why Jesus says that the man should not live by just bread alone that's right that's right but by every word of God that proceeds out of the mouth of God amen praise the Lord amen why because the word of God causes life the same whole that caused Adam to live amen will cause you to live amen amen receive that same Holy Spirit if you can receive that word praise God why is it so the word of God why is it so important that we get in the word of God amen praise the Lord because we're not just dealing with just a dead letter it's in a way I know what sometimes we say it's dead letter and yes it's dead letter if it's not being lived through someone but remember it was God breathed so it's got life amen it's got life now that life amen wants to come into you so that you can replicate that word because I mean here in in the pages of the book it's not going to do anything but it becomes more of an inspiration to someone else if it can come into someone and live through you live through them amen amen and that's the reason why Paul could say in the gospel in Romans he says this he says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation it is a power it was enough power to create the heavens and the Earth and it's enough power to create a man sir or do what it needs to do for your life to everyone that believeth what see Mary had to believe amen then it took action right to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith amen praise the Lord Jesus and that's the same thing Saints with the word of God today just as they wanted to find a willing recipient or a willing vessel during the time of Mary it wants to find a resting place in this hour that we live in let the story of what happened the Christmas story let it not just be in the in in in as a story amen bring it down further Lord let that word of God Amen live in me let me give birth to this word just as Mary gave birth to it in the physical let me give birth to it in the spiritual I want to be not just let me give birth to I want to be born again amen praise the Lord Jesus let it be something active and living and changing me from day to day that as I get in the word of God Amen that it's not just me trying to get through a a whole year of the Bible reading but it's letting that that Bible get through me amen and living through me and changing me praise God amen sometimes we just want to read the word of God and just uh today's this this scripture reading and then okay I fulfilled my duty for today is it is it alive in you what can you go immediately and put it into action because that's what the word of God wants us to do amen praise the Lord Jesus amen brother Brown says this here in the mark of the beast he says in 1956 and then it ought not to be approached by some mental theology it should be approached by the scripture scripture must answer to scripture we realize that reading the Bible you do not read it like you would a newspaper or a magazine or or or or anything that you you enjoy reading back then it was newspapers because it's been the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to hide many things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and we reveal it to babes such as would learn God wants somebody who's hungry watch this now God wants somebody who's hungry so he can just take them over to one side and set them down and say here it is child of mine This Is It isn't that what he did with Mary took her to the side this is what this is what's going to be you've been chosen beloved right amen that's what God can do for you take you to the side and reveal things to you that you've never even even thought of that are heading in his word if you could just take the time to do it I'm telling you Saints there's so much open in the word of God there's so much in the word of God that we still not not not not not getting for one of the reasons why we're still here right praise God something that we're not still getting amen praise God so God wants somebody who's hungry so he can just take them over to one side and set them down and say here it is child of mine this is it the world don't understand this but ye shall understand see let it be this way then all scripture given by inspiration then it must be interpreted by inspiration amen and then scripture must compare with scripture you try to that they have given challenges to people about I'll you know tell me where the Bible contradicts itself and nobody can fight nobody can can show that there may be some areas that you may look like in that from the natural human eye it looks like it's contradicting itself but that's the reason why we need revelation amen Revelation just opens the curtain up and lets you see everything clearly yeah amen and who can give Revelation the Holy Ghost amen who's the one that that that has inspired this word brother Brandon says here now we have take now we could take that from a dozen different angles tonight of being the Jewish nation that was cursed and many every word of God written is inspiration and it hooks the whole Bible together on every word in the Bible it's the most wonderful book that was ever written there's never a piece of literature ever written like the Bible it's the only book in existence tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going tell me tell me what other writer can tell you that amen tell me what what what what Max Lucado can can can tell you that all right Edgar Allan Poe or or Mark Twain all right I can never tell you where you're going they can entertain you for a while and Max Lucado he can maybe help you spirit in some spiritual areas you know I'm not saying his his information is bad but the one that can hold the destiny of your future is the word of God because those writings that I've just mentioned they're not alive they're not active Max lucado's writings if we if we're here 200 more years amen they probably may be obsolete then not the word of God the word of God right now is fresh it's good for this time if we're here 200 more years the people that are living then they'll be able to benefit from it just as much what an awesome word that we've really served amen praise God we've got libraries full and streets full and full but never of them not none of them none of their great philosophers that's raised and Fallen they have ever never been able to tell us what this Bible has told us and all true science moves right back to the Bible for its evidence amen I bet it's very interesting that that brother Brown and puts that in there amen all right we're gonna relieve science are we going to believe the Bible I'd rather believe the Bible amen science got it wrong gay men back in the days of Noah I wonder if that's not the same thing that's happening today sometimes we got our Gods amen our our government gods that are probably telling us not even the truth that's right I wonder if that that's why Jesus didn't say that if if it wasn't like this the days of Noah that today is like the days of Noah everybody's looking up to the sky looking for aliens I'm looking for all kinds of stuff they got something ready for you yeah you just you you wait and see and it ain't what they're telling you right now so are you going to hold on to the word of God are you gonna hold on to NASA are you going to hold on to to science just think about it amen I wanna I wanna give this example amen and you know sometimes we we we look at the word and and you maybe you might still be thinking well I mean I don't know I still don't know if I could trust it you know but but let's say you receive a text message from someone on your phone right it's got it's a it's a it's a strange number and you've never you've never seen that number before like we a lot of us get text messages nowadays saying hi you better watch it to me when I get those text messages it's time to play it's time to have fun oh yeah and I've had some some interesting conversations with some of them and they and you know what they turn out to be they turn out to be people from the Middle East India that they somehow they got your phone number and they're just trying to be able to get something out of you right so when somebody says hey hi who's this oh isn't this isn't this uh Steve or whatever you know they're trying to start initiate a conversation I had one one the other day that wasn't I initiated a conversation with and uh the uh the the conversation went into a to a point where he started he started cursing and he started and I knew right then that it wasn't it wasn't an Asian it wasn't in China it wasn't because I I mean I've been around Asian people long enough that I just I just know that they're not that way they're very they're very but but and I'm not saying this just just understand me Indian people and and people like that they they kind of tend to be more that way you see a little bit more abrupt than the way they speak so that's why I thought that maybe hey it might be it might be someone like that sure enough it was it was somebody from I believe it was Pakistan and uh and he and it got to a political talk he said well you Americans you come over here and you take over our land and and all this stuff and and I don't agree with your president and all that stuff I said listen I don't agree with him either he said well you should go over and shoot your president I said listen I I even though I disagree with him I mean I'm not I'm gonna go and do that I said because for one I'm a Christian and the word of God prohibits for me to do something like that I mean after talking longer and he said uh he didn't say anything after that yeah so but I have fun with these people but anyways let's say you receive a text message it's a no number or whatever and and uh and you're like what in the world who is this right well you have the right to say who is it because you don't know the person you don't know the number that's writing you but what if you receive a text message but if I receive a text message from Brother Wade he sends me a text message and he says something on there and I know that it's from Brother Wade why because I've had a personal relationship with him I've got his name in my in my contacts I know that that's him I know that that's his number now I don't I don't know if maybe sister June took his phone and sent the text message but I know that it's coming from a reliable source because I have met him and I know him personally and I have his number saved in in my life the device of my life all right well that's the same thing with you and and God right man God gives us his word and to you that don't understand God to you it comes in as a text message that you don't understand who's this from I don't know it's boring amen but if you had a relationship with God you knew you would know exactly where that word's coming from you would know that it's the Lord Jesus Christ that's the name that you have in my in your contacts and you would and you would reply to that message and you would do it with confidence because you know that you are replying to a reliable source amen that's the word of God we're not serving cunningly devices or fables or anything like that it's the true word of God Saints and if the word said it I believe it and that settles it for me amen amen that settles it for me praise the Lord Jesus listen even for brother Branham he said if I say something outside of the word of God he said you don't have to take my word he said you stay with the absolute amen and the absolute wasn't him the absolute is his word the word of God his word brother Branham amen we know that his life and the the and what he preached amen reflected back from the absolute amen but if something that brother Branham said amen doesn't line up with the word I don't have to take what brother Brandon said right ah that sounds scary I don't know if I should but that's what came first amen the Bible or the ma or the message what was inspired right amen now don't get don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say anything about that because there's there's sometimes people bring it as if it's a competition I'd rather have the Bible than the message or the message before the Bible because the message is the revelation of this no amen there's some things that brother Branham said that were his own opinion too but there was a lot of things with regards to the word that was thus said the Lord and if you don't receive it then you're rejecting God amen praise the Lord Jesus so I want to stay with the word I want to stay with the message of the hour because I know the message took me back to the word praise the Lord so a god-breathed word produces a god-breathed life Amen Let the word of God breathe on you tonight amen let's stand to our feet praise the Lord hey man is let's just uh let's just borrow our heads if anybody has needed prayer you're more than welcome to pray with him almighty God we
