[5:16] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[5:19] of the word I pray that you will as I
[5:22] said listen to what I brought this
[5:25] morning I kind of put a message in that
[5:27] I had been thinking on and I do
[5:31] that and I'll lay something aside and
[5:34] bring it out later you know and try to
[5:36] put it all in together
[5:38] to give a better understanding to where
[5:41] we can follow it because when I when I
[5:44] study the Word of God I look at it that
[5:46] way are the prophets message I'll
[5:48] reference from one message to the next
[5:51] message in the books and things you were
[5:54] to see my my old books I've got them in
[5:56] writing volumes and they're all there
[5:58] you know and and I can a lot of times I
[6:01] still use it now because I'll try to
[6:04] think of something that I want to say
[6:06] and and I can't find it in the computer
[6:09] cuz I'm off just to her well then I'll
[6:11] sit there for a minute and I'll think
[6:13] [Music]
[6:15] Ross the mystery and then I'll just go
[6:18] pull the book out and you know what I
[6:21] find my quote so I like all of those
[6:23] things but to tie things together I love
[6:26] to see the things that the Bible has to
[6:30] bring it into manifestation and to show
[6:34] things I love to do that like this
[6:37] morning where we were bringing the the
[6:40] part you know to where the city would
[6:42] turn our hearts back and you know I just
[6:46] asked some simple questions I pray you
[6:48] would just consider those questions and
[6:50] you know ponder them in your mind what
[6:54] I've tried to just more or less lay down
[6:56] a line that this is the way that it came
[6:59] in from John to Jesus to disciples all
[7:04] right know then in other part as to
[7:08] bringing it to her that it comes from
[7:10] now back because we lost away from that
[7:14] we had to start off with that's just
[7:16] shall live by faith
[7:17] yes the Prophet had to come and build it
[7:19] up and bringing it up and it took him
[7:22] about 30 years to bring up the message
[7:24] to were that he could start then and
[7:26] bring his own message and see then that
[7:29] was coming back from there towards the
[7:32] disciples and back to the Ministry of
[7:34] Jesus Christ and then it goes from there
[7:37] to the Bride of Christ being the finish
[7:40] of it all through the fivefold ministry
[7:42] what to me that that to me it just
[7:45] all of it together I can see it going
[7:48] all the way through the Bible and coming
[7:50] out at the end to reach the finality of
[7:53] the goal of it all this is like the
[7:55] statue of a perfect man we take that and
[7:58] we study that and if you'll study it
[8:00] from adoption you'll see that it comes
[8:03] out to the same ending factor our point
[8:07] that your adoption message was but if
[8:10] you take the adoption it'll come out the
[8:12] same way as the statue of a perfect man
[8:13] it comes that's what they're trying to
[8:15] do is get us to see you know what they
[8:19] saw and the disciples is the ones that
[8:22] wrote the message now not the not the
[8:24] novices and the people that come along
[8:26] later Paul is one who is the only one
[8:29] that would basically come on over a
[8:31] little later in time but remember now
[8:34] Paul was a prophet so he had to go to
[8:36] the desert to get his and he said I
[8:38] conferred not with any of them
[8:40] you know over this and he came out
[8:43] preaching brother run said him and Peter
[8:45] preached the same thing so then that way
[8:48] you know it was meant to be in that
[8:50] order but I pray you will listen to that
[8:53] thought and you'll see that it winds up
[8:55] in the last days that brother Branham
[8:57] would bring us the message it would go
[9:00] into the the depth of the understanding
[9:03] come into the opening of the seals to me
[9:06] the seals as Jesus Christ all right
[9:10] that's the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[9:13] be given that no man knew it had not
[9:16] been made known and the prophets message
[9:20] then began in the opening of the seals
[9:21] the other was in restoration he had to
[9:24] do a restoration or work or that not a
[9:27] reform now Luther Wesley Azusa Street
[9:31] Reform restoration in the part of word
[9:36] that they had but reformed in the basis
[9:39] of what they wound up being they wound
[9:42] up not being the move of God that it was
[9:45] supposed to be they wound up with reform
[9:47] all right but then the Prophet came not
[9:50] as reform but restoration bringing it
[9:54] back to the original faith of the
[9:56] fathers
[9:58] bringing it back to where it would be
[10:00] riding that we were built on the
[10:01] foundation apostles and prophets Jesus
[10:03] Christ being the chief Cornerstone I
[10:05] pray you would just take those things
[10:07] and consider the thoughts that I was
[10:10] asking you that we talked about John
[10:12] being to come to be the one that would
[10:15] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[10:18] children
[10:18] he never preached two messages right out
[10:25] of all the one he had about a half a
[10:27] dozen converse so there's no way that he
[10:31] turned the children of Israel that was
[10:34] not the ones to be turned it was the
[10:37] elect of Israel that caught the message
[10:42] from John John introduced him to Jesus
[10:44] Christ Jesus Christ comes on with whale
[10:47] you know leaving it into that 12 then he
[10:52] comes and throughout his ministry you
[10:55] know he only gets a 120 right it's not a
[11:00] big thing see we're looking for great
[11:02] big things to happen it's so small they
[11:06] can go right among us and us miss it and
[11:08] we'll never see it but to take those
[11:12] things and you just follow it that's the
[11:14] way I study the word I like love to see
[11:17] it compare you know this to compare with
[11:21] this and this to compare with this then
[11:23] I know that I'm following in the right
[11:26] direction you know because that's that's
[11:28] the way that I want it to be all right
[11:30] so just take that thought listen to it
[11:32] it was just a an injected message to
[11:36] bring the thought of what we were
[11:40] wanting we want to pick back up now and
[11:41] where we were on the stature of a
[11:44] perfect man all right so now we finished
[11:47] up on speaking of bringing it down and
[11:52] we've come to godliness all right and
[11:55] coming to the point of godliness we've
[11:59] looked at it as a lot of things but
[12:04] tried to understand to see that as it is
[12:07] with us a lot of the other words virtue
[12:12] see is not to just be a virgin its
[12:17] virtuous life that's power strength all
[12:19] right patience just to show those that
[12:22] stands up so much in front that you can
[12:24] see them and you go to temperance and
[12:27] that's not to not drink it alcohol
[12:29] that's to how to control that temper and
[12:33] see then I hope you caught the point he
[12:35] said well but when I got born again I
[12:37] ain't had no temper since then
[12:39] well who's blowing the whistle you know
[12:42] as the story was told you know that it's
[12:46] not a joke but the cat was whining like
[12:50] everything one day and mama said to
[12:52] Johnny said Johnny said you're pulling
[12:55] that cat's tail he said no mama I'm not
[12:58] pulling his tail said he's pulling it
[13:02] huh you get the point
[13:06] you get the point what I'm talking about
[13:08] I'm not trying to cause confusion I'm
[13:12] trying to straighten a lot of it out to
[13:14] get us from squealing so much and and
[13:17] we're showing by our squealing that we
[13:19] don't know where we're at
[13:20] right see that's uh that's take it from
[13:25] that okay now so we're talking about
[13:28] godliness as I said to you back there in
[13:32] the message a good bit about it that we
[13:36] are supposed to be taking what the
[13:38] Prophet says these words mean and the
[13:42] application of them instead of what the
[13:44] literal spelling of the word or the
[13:47] literal thought you know see our
[13:52] thoughts is is leading over to something
[13:56] like the patience the temperance and
[13:59] time leaning it over if we take it to
[14:02] the wrong thing we come out the wrong
[14:04] example but if we get into what the
[14:06] Prophet is saying now I'm doing this
[14:09] more for another message on down the
[14:11] road a little bit all right I'm gonna
[14:13] lay in a little foundational part
[14:15] because we're going to get to it when we
[14:17] finish this up be a couple of messages
[14:20] but brother branham sitting talking one
[14:23] day he said about the innocence statute
[14:26] man on the true baptism of the Holy
[14:28] Spirit no what does he mean true baptism
[14:37] you say oh yeah but we've got the
[14:40] anointed ones that's not the true
[14:42] baptism that's that can be the baptism
[14:45] on your spirit what does he mean when he
[14:49] talked about true baptism there's a lot
[14:53] of things that we need to consider if we
[14:57] get to it this afternoon if not we'll
[14:59] move it over and we try to pick up like
[15:02] brotherly kindness and we're trying to
[15:05] deal with brotherly kindness and it
[15:08] might not be exactly Oh the thoughts we
[15:12] have of brotherly kindness it can be
[15:15] other things that's my point of trying
[15:17] to get you to look at the statue of a
[15:18] perfect man listen to what brother
[15:20] Branham says these things are all right
[15:25] tell us what virtue is tell us what what
[15:29] temperance is tell us what you know
[15:31] patience is and things and it comes out
[15:34] a little different from what we have our
[15:36] mindset as to what it was the saying and
[15:39] that's the main thing okay all right
[15:42] coming to godliness brother Brennan city
[15:46] looked in many dictionaries and said he
[15:51] couldn't find the definition well we
[15:55] said then finally he found the
[15:56] definition
[15:57] well now I'm as honest as I can be I
[16:01] think that that's we're not getting a
[16:05] point there I don't think he looked in
[16:08] five different dictionaries and never
[16:09] found the word godliness right because
[16:14] it's in the dictionaries you know I
[16:17] think what he's saying is the definition
[16:21] I wanted to find of godliness was what I
[16:26] couldn't find because godliness in the
[16:29] natural dictionary would read you to be
[16:32] in pious deities and things making your
[16:36] words coming in to the form of of
[16:39] God in his ways and things instead of
[16:43] being what he wanted so he wanted the
[16:46] definition of godliness to be like God
[16:51] well that's that's just know the Pope he
[16:57] can take all of his glory hallelujah
[16:59] everybody thinks he's God right they
[17:03] worship Him as God is that the kind of
[17:07] gardening this you won't there's plenty
[17:11] of people who have whole lot better
[17:13] lives than me and you have right you
[17:17] think in your mind about somebody that
[17:18] in your life and you do it that was a
[17:21] real good person and you could say you
[17:24] know they were really godly in their
[17:26] living well but don't have it all the
[17:33] new birth so we need to find out what
[17:41] these words mean by profits definition
[17:47] okay because when he got to gets to
[17:50] brotherly kindness when he comes to that
[17:55] point he's he just laying it down like a
[17:58] thought about your brothers then all at
[18:01] once you got to go to another message he
[18:04] pick it up and then he begins then you
[18:06] can understand that he's not just
[18:08] talking about loving your brother he's
[18:12] got some other things in mind so that's
[18:14] what we need to do that's what I'm
[18:16] trying to do is to get us to dwell on
[18:19] what is the Prophet saying about these
[18:23] things that should relate to you and I
[18:26] all right now so if it's to be like God
[18:30] so you'd say well we're just what we
[18:32] need to do is just just be like God well
[18:36] what does being like God mean okay you'd
[18:41] say well it means be like God is pious
[18:44] and holy and all Etha that's not exactly
[18:48] what he's saying he's got a position
[18:50] it's got a thought to it
[18:52] that dwells in a heavier stage than our
[18:56] understanding so let's get a little bit
[18:57] on it okay now forgive me for repeating
[19:01] a lot of times that the quotes and the
[19:04] things but I found repetitive is very
[19:07] helpful it helps us to remember all
[19:12] right now so what did the Prophet say
[19:16] about this godliness that was a rare or
[19:23] an odd statement what is to be like God
[19:29] okay now brother Branham we're asking
[19:33] you the definition and he said I looked
[19:36] in many dictionaries and said God didn't
[19:39] this means to be like God all right now
[19:43] what is it brother Branham to be like
[19:45] God when we say we can't be like God and
[19:55] he says yes you can
[19:58] well now are we going to argue the
[20:01] points with him or take the thought and
[20:03] find out what he's talking about all
[20:07] right
[20:07] so he says you know he found the word
[20:12] godliness all these different places you
[20:15] say I can't what does he say in faith
[20:17] first or not attempt was played then be
[20:19] like God he says we he said you say I
[20:23] can't do that brother Branham oh yes you
[20:27] can
[20:28] so now whatever definition we have of
[20:32] godliness now we have of godless is not
[20:39] attainable you know no no listen to what
[20:48] he's saying well we have a definition of
[20:52] godliness is impossible for us to a time
[20:56] and he said yes we can now he's going to
[21:01] give us the definition of godliness
[21:05] and then by giving it to us we can see
[21:11] the possibility or I may I'll say it
[21:13] because this is why I see things you
[21:15] know when I see things in the Word of
[21:16] God I don't know whether you you're
[21:19] crazy as I am I know you're not but I
[21:22] begin to see a little hole in the ground
[21:27] all right
[21:29] and I keep looking at the hole in the
[21:32] ground and the closer I get to the hole
[21:34] in the ground now I'm trying to explain
[21:35] something in the spiritual okay the
[21:38] closer I get to the hole in the ground I
[21:40] begin to see light on the other end and
[21:45] as far as I get in the tunnel then I get
[21:48] to a place that I'm seeing light that
[21:50] away and I'm seeing light this way but
[21:53] that's not I'm wanting to go to that
[21:55] light because that's what's leading me
[21:56] now I'm talking about the gospel I think
[21:58] talking about that's going to a bill or
[22:00] a wall and look at it seeing it I'm
[22:03] trying to explain how I do things that
[22:06] as I begin to see something and it
[22:08] begins to unfold it'll begin to unfold
[22:12] very gradual some of the things that
[22:16] brother Branham says in the statute of a
[22:18] perfect man
[22:19] I admit that sometimes it took 20 years
[22:25] to understand what he's talking about he
[22:35] says godliness yeah and I say I can't be
[22:40] that and then though he's not talking
[22:43] about trying to be pious and golden good
[22:45] so I got away from that but I think he
[22:47] says we can do it well then I got to go
[22:50] to him that's my light at the end of the
[22:53] tunnel is to go to him to find out
[22:56] what's going on all right now he says I
[23:00] can't do that brother Branham oh yes you
[23:03] can now we know the story behind the
[23:07] emphases of things that the Prophet
[23:09] would say that if God requires us to
[23:11] have anything it is necessary that he
[23:15] make a way for us to be able to attain
[23:19] unto it if he requires it is that true
[23:22] no he is up to him all right so now how
[23:26] does he make away
[23:28] what definition does he give of
[23:30] godliness that gives us light at the end
[23:33] of the tunnel to be able to look and see
[23:35] a little bit maybe a little ray of light
[23:37] as we call it let's just read a few
[23:39] scriptures here they told me been
[23:44] godlessness Matthew 5:48 we take this
[23:49] one and see what it sounds like Matthew
[23:52] 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be
[23:54] like God now then he say in Matthew 5:48
[23:59] shows us that we're supposed to be like
[24:02] God are you reading come on read read
[24:06] what is that and see if you're supposed
[24:08] to be like God you know Bible says
[24:10] you're gods
[24:12] okay Jesus said well all the virtue all
[24:16] the things that's in God is in you
[24:20] there's Matthew 5:48 right being Jesus
[24:24] speaking in the Beatitudes be therefore
[24:26] perfect what's that perfect as your
[24:30] father in heaven is perfect now look
[24:33] this is what I love when I admit it took
[24:39] a long time to be able to understand
[24:40] what that was being said go look at it
[24:44] we got way up here now before you're
[24:48] asked to do that you got up to godliness
[24:53] then where's godliness one two three
[24:59] four five six you know way up here now
[25:05] be there for perfect comes into view you
[25:08] see why we couldn't understand it so we
[25:10] took the Baptist idea of perfections or
[25:14] this idea about it and we could never
[25:16] move any further we finally come up with
[25:18] the definition of being perfect is to to
[25:23] be complete let this kind of settle it
[25:26] and he dropped it all right
[25:27] but now listen you got way up here now
[25:31] before you're asked to do
[25:33] that why now I'm reviewing so come on
[25:38] and catch out so we have problems in
[25:42] these areas here we have problems in
[25:51] those areas so when you're born again he
[25:55] said well God expects me to be perfect
[25:56] now that's not what the Prophet said as
[26:01] far as God is concerned we're perfect
[26:04] right if you're born again
[26:07] you're perfect far as God is concerned
[26:09] off but that ain't according to what I'm
[26:12] concerned with I'm concerned with me and
[26:17] that's where we live that all right look
[26:20] you've got way up here now before you
[26:22] ask to do that all of these things has
[26:24] to be added first thanks virtue or
[26:28] knowledge temperance patience has to be
[26:31] added before you're required to be
[26:33] perfect and to be perfect is godliness
[26:39] okay is that what he say then when you
[26:45] get up here he's asked you now to be
[26:48] perfect godliness sons and daughters of
[26:51] God that's right anything he said I
[26:53] could say but one hit man you come all
[26:56] the way up to you called them all the
[27:01] way up to godliness and God expects you
[27:04] now to be perfect huh now do we need to
[27:10] read view that any at all because the
[27:13] faith you can lay in it and say well
[27:15] with this editor will remember virtue
[27:22] you got some problems are especially
[27:25] temperance when you've got a little
[27:29] uncontrollable temper let's see that's
[27:33] where our problem is and what our
[27:35] trouble is we won't admit it no I know
[27:39] how no temper
[27:43] so right now I'm gonna just follow the
[27:47] Prophet through the best I can for him
[27:51] to tell me how bad I was but after a
[27:55] while he does expect me to start moving
[27:56] in the right direction okay
[27:59] now is that what we're getting to now
[28:03] look what he goes on that's I have to
[28:11] use the mobile Isis let's going up to
[28:16] paragraph three oh nine we'll just run
[28:17] it on up painting look thrilling I look
[28:23] after you done come from here to here to
[28:27] here to here to here one two three four
[28:34] five six Niner seven one of the two now
[28:38] you're coming into the full stature of a
[28:41] son of God but you've got to have this
[28:47] plus all of this and you can't even
[28:51] start until you get this all right now
[28:57] you're looking at the pyramid what's he
[28:58] saying you got to have this and this and
[29:02] this that but you've got to have this
[29:04] before you even start because that's the
[29:07] new birth huh little brother Dale I
[29:10] don't know I've gots problems what you
[29:12] what are you doing now
[29:13] because it's just I just finally got
[29:15] around to realize the new bird made me
[29:17] perfect now you're telling me I ain't
[29:19] perfect
[29:21] you're not complete if you'll take the
[29:26] definition of it you'll see yourself
[29:28] when you got born again you as a baby in
[29:31] Christ right is that what the Bible said
[29:33] desiring a sincere of milk of the word
[29:35] that we may grow thy buys that's the
[29:37] scripture
[29:37] all right we're babies babies ain't
[29:39] perfect human beings you know what I
[29:40] mean they perfect babies but after a
[29:45] while they ain't too perfect right cuz
[29:49] they start acting like okay but listen
[29:56] see if we use the word complete in our
[30:01] understanding
[30:03] let's say I remember this one most of
[30:05] you can remember Oh
[30:07] in the Bible it uses the word and a lot
[30:13] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:17] God and Father that's two of them right
[30:25] now what's a simple little point that
[30:28] you can use to eradicate that thought
[30:32] you just translate because it's done in
[30:35] the Bible you translate the word from an
[30:38] to even we knew this in the Baptist
[30:41] Church Presbyterian shake a head because
[30:43] we knew a lot about that right we we did
[30:46] understand a few of those words so
[30:50] you're not reading God and Father God
[30:54] even father now you've just made a
[30:57] little translation in error at work I'm
[31:00] just translating with me the right word
[31:01] in your minds capacity to understand a
[31:05] little better so when you're reading the
[31:07] Bible and you're confused about where it
[31:10] says something like that God and father
[31:12] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:13] yeah this write that in your Bible if
[31:17] you need to you know I mean there's no
[31:19] problem because you're not destroying
[31:21] the Bible you're just putting it and
[31:23] understanding to where you can follow it
[31:25] so it's God even father of our Lord
[31:28] Jesus Christ that's simple
[31:31] that helps a lot or understanding all
[31:35] right yeah so is it with this after you
[31:40] don't come from here to here to here
[31:41] here you're coming in two full stacks
[31:43] right now it's not oh god you got how
[31:45] this this this there's no you can't even
[31:49] get started until you get this when you
[31:52] come down here now watch him when you
[31:56] get down here
[31:57] a genuine born-again dove then you don't
[32:03] add nothing it adds to you come going up
[32:07] alright coming into
[32:09] perfection now so what is Matthew 5:48
[32:13] bu therefore perfect
[32:17] what is godliness to be perfect
[32:24] well then translate the word in your
[32:26] mind what is perfect mean then you get
[32:30] into the way from trying to find out
[32:32] sinless something in to realize in what
[32:35] everything is and realizing that
[32:40] perfection is godliness but it's
[32:45] perfection in the basis that it's a full
[32:50] age maturity is what you're dealing with
[32:55] throughout the statue of a perfect man
[32:57] you're dealing with maturity to try to
[33:01] understand what is being said and
[33:04] remember maturity I mean my kids they
[33:13] come in home you know I'm there I went
[33:15] to ninth grade a couple of weeks in the
[33:18] 10th
[33:18] so I mean literate okay and the kids
[33:22] came in telling me all about this word
[33:24] called algebra a equals B and I didn't
[33:35] understand it and one of them said well
[33:38] daddy what it simply means algebra comes
[33:41] down to where you can use it like this
[33:43] said it means PI R square that's algebra
[33:52] you come you know 3.14 okay I do know
[33:57] that over here what I tried my best to
[34:03] get every one of them to do something
[34:05] and they would do it
[34:06] I told mind you go back and tell that
[34:08] teacher that yo daddy said he didn't
[34:13] care what algebra said pi wouldn't
[34:15] Squire
[34:18] cornbread square pies round I never did
[34:23] get me all right Jake you a little bit
[34:27] where you listen now all right go we got
[34:30] another thump to go all right but now
[34:34] listen you come all the way up to
[34:40] godliness and God requires it were
[34:44] perfect and godliness and he's given us
[34:50] the definition of godliness and
[34:53] perfection to word that we can come to
[34:56] complete and we see that we are complete
[35:00] in him but even at the point of
[35:04] godliness were still not complete like
[35:07] the disciples were that's the main
[35:10] thought because they were perfect they
[35:13] were complete because they had the
[35:17] understanding of the word all right now
[35:23] in doing that you come all the way up to
[35:26] where you're at then you're asked to be
[35:29] perfect you're asked to be complete and
[35:34] the Bible says we're completing him so
[35:38] then he's making a way to give us the
[35:41] definitions of things that we can see a
[35:44] little ray at the end of the tunnel to
[35:47] be able to follow that and to look
[35:48] forward to something and we can see well
[35:51] hey this is this is not getting too bad
[35:53] after all
[35:54] oh because he's waiting on us to come to
[36:01] a place of perfection and he's given us
[36:08] everything we have need of which is this
[36:11] message brought to us by the disciples
[36:15] you know what I'm talking about they
[36:17] brought the message he broke it down to
[36:19] us Peter name wrote the statue of a
[36:23] perfect man brother branham and brought
[36:25] that to us into our own language and
[36:28] terminologies and understandings
[36:31] to where we could follow it and see a
[36:34] ray of hope for perfection you know of a
[36:38] hope for godliness me and then their
[36:43] ideas of godliness and things change a
[36:45] little but he brought it and he said we
[36:47] bring it all the way up to here still
[36:50] gonna look where he came they come to
[36:54] godliness let's see I have to keep
[37:03] relating back to this because one time
[37:05] if you lose my thought you're gonna lose
[37:07] what I'm talking about so then we come
[37:11] to godliness godliness is to be like God
[37:15] the Prophet takes you to being like God
[37:18] as to Matthew 5:48 to be therefore
[37:21] perfect because then the word perfect
[37:25] can be translated down into our
[37:27] terminology in the natural to mean
[37:30] complete then we're not trying to look
[37:34] at something as godly or what I got
[37:37] that's good I hadn't done I hadn't seen
[37:39] to all week long boy I'm doing pretty
[37:41] good yeah well I got one coming though
[37:44] you know another week so don't worry
[37:47] about it
[37:47] yeah but he's just trying to get you to
[37:51] think about something and why would a
[37:54] prophet make certain statements why
[37:59] would he say that perfection is
[38:03] godliness our God in this is perfection
[38:08] of which the way you want to terminology
[38:12] what would he say that he would say that
[38:16] to try to straighten out our thoughts
[38:18] about what's going on right okay now
[38:26] let's read another one you know how to
[38:29] express this as a point okay but writing
[38:32] preaches the message called a statue of
[38:34] a perfect man that was 10 10 14
[38:43] then at 11:04 in origin which would have
[38:48] been a little while later he preaches a
[38:51] message called blasphemous names he does
[38:57] not explain in statue of a perfect man
[39:02] about sister Sheppard's dream he doesn't
[39:05] know about it well she comes to him
[39:10] after he preaches it and tells him that
[39:14] she had a dream and that the dream he
[39:19] said to dream was scriptural and exactly
[39:22] what he was preaching with her dream all
[39:27] right do you understand that then so
[39:29] we'll be using for blasphemy insane
[39:31] statue of perfect man you see you'll
[39:34] never follow the message of the statue
[39:36] of a perfect man incorrect understanding
[39:37] without blasphemy it's not because
[39:40] blessed see miss now even give you some
[39:41] keys help you to understand now listen
[39:45] to what he goes so he's explaining
[39:48] Christ mr. godwyn I mean a statue of
[39:50] perfect man I love that Christ the
[39:52] minister s one things in me in the
[39:55] Statue of a perfect man he's explaining
[39:57] these virtues but he's not giving he
[40:02] just given you a definition for making
[40:05] sure we follow what he means by virtue
[40:08] what he means by temperance what he
[40:11] means by knowledge what he means then by
[40:16] godliness okay now he comes over a few
[40:22] blasphemous names and he tells the dream
[40:25] in the things and then he gives the
[40:27] interpretation so go ahead were number
[40:30] three and let's get something in here he
[40:32] makes an outstanding a statement from
[40:36] blasphemous names 62 to my knowledge I
[40:40] had temperance self-control I like that
[40:44] my country kids with the crown my soul
[40:47] with self-control from sea to shining
[40:50] sea that's which means we got problems
[40:53] all right
[40:54] patience oh my
[40:57] tested don't you worry Satan will count
[41:00] them for you but look what he said I'm
[41:03] climbing up the ladder now I've added
[41:08] virtue knowledge temperance now I've got
[41:13] to add patience and watch what he says I
[41:18] still ain't got to hold it goes
[41:29] no brother branham what are you talking
[41:32] about because you spent the whole
[41:35] emphases of the statute of a perfect man
[41:37] the very beginning of it and all the way
[41:40] into 20 or 30 pages explaining how the
[41:43] new birth was the statute was the point
[41:48] to bring you eternal life the new birth
[41:50] was the born-again experience and that
[41:54] you can't there's one direct quote I've
[41:55] got it in here you can't even start well
[41:57] he said it well ago oh no you can't even
[41:59] start without having a new birth and
[42:01] he's explaining the new birth and he's
[42:05] explaining the new birth is eternal life
[42:08] Christ's own life coming and living in
[42:11] you he's expressing it as to what it
[42:14] means to be born again read the message
[42:17] over and over I ask you to now all at
[42:21] once he comes to this message and he's
[42:24] coming down describing them pull it back
[42:26] down this to her he's describing them
[42:30] and he says just like he said about the
[42:35] other he said you come out of this way
[42:39] to godliness before God requires for you
[42:42] to be perfect
[42:50] before he requires you to be complete
[42:54] perfect now he comes into the message
[43:00] explaining the dream which is identical
[43:02] to the Statue of a perfect man he tells
[43:07] it I'll give it to you and when he does
[43:11] he said now I've got to add patience I'm
[43:18] gonna ain't even got to hold it off
[43:23] what is he meaning when you've already
[43:26] got the Holy Spirit as your new birth
[43:33] right you see one church and that's
[43:38] where I don't have a problem okay I know
[43:40] you don't like these ideas and things I
[43:42] come up with
[43:43] see that's why I ain't gonna worry about
[43:44] doing away I ain't worried about my job
[43:46] getting done away cuz my jobs always
[43:49] been one time if you want to make me
[43:52] anything in the world oh this has always
[43:55] been my ministry if you want to know
[43:57] what brother Dale's ministry is where is
[43:59] he in the body of Christ I'm in one time
[44:02] I love controversial things that look
[44:07] odd and look unexplainable and if you'll
[44:15] think back you that have been here 30 40
[44:17] years you will realize that's what I've
[44:20] done right some of your life and grinnin
[44:23] taking your head everything you know
[44:25] that's what I've done it's a challenge
[44:29] to me to see controversial things
[44:33] because I know that if we can get that
[44:36] straightened out we've got a wonderful
[44:41] glorious thing in our possession you
[44:47] didn't catch this morning.we if there's
[44:50] this it's the same as this this and this
[44:52] okay that's why I love it I love it when
[44:58] the Prophet would say you come all the
[45:01] way up to here and you ain't got to hold
[45:02] it goes yet
[45:04] when I brought around I'd like that
[45:07] woman was what was her name Shepard I
[45:11] believe it was the lady that had to
[45:13] dream I'm like her yeah I never did take
[45:17] nobody's idea as to where that I'm born
[45:19] again or not you know my story I was two
[45:22] years in this message doesn't spent ten
[45:27] and the Baptist Church to a deacon and
[45:29] everything in the world and studying the
[45:31] Word of God come into this message never
[45:33] claim coming in the message as an uber
[45:36] never claim seeing angels as an uber
[45:39] never claimed any experience I've had as
[45:41] to saying that I had the new birth never
[45:47] it's always been the birth of the word
[45:51] that's been that from me from day one
[45:54] the birth of the word the revealing of
[45:57] God's Word so it didn't bother me to
[46:01] tackle when back in the years everybody
[46:07] was saying oh yeah we understand we
[46:08] understand that brother Branham said on
[46:11] Daniel seventy weeks in the book it's in
[46:15] as a matter of fact they put it in a
[46:16] leaflet in the front of the old original
[46:18] 70 weeks book he said if you don't
[46:21] understand Daniel 70 weeks
[46:23] you can't understand the seals the
[46:27] plagues the vials and the different
[46:28] thing he names about five things that he
[46:31] says you can't understand I didn't name
[46:36] them he named those that you can't
[46:40] understand if you don't understand
[46:42] Daniel 70 ways what everybody else want
[46:46] to study this once they're there you
[46:47] know what I wonder study Daniel 70 weeks
[46:49] and your look at my old book oh it's
[46:52] good
[46:53] I'd read it and I'd put a question mark
[46:56] that meant I didn't understand what he's
[46:59] talking about
[47:00] and when I got through I had a question
[47:03] mark book because every page had at
[47:07] least two it's requested marked right
[47:10] I'm shown to you let's see I just didn't
[47:15] quit and I didn't try to think
[47:17] get out I just kept waiting on God and
[47:22] as I waited on him I'd study it again
[47:25] and I'd wait a while and I'd read it
[47:27] again and I just Ike's out that question
[47:31] and then I understood that still had a
[47:35] book full I never preached it till ever
[47:37] question was marked out I wouldn't do it
[47:42] until all of them was marked out I
[47:44] wasn't scared then of somebody coming
[47:47] along with some idea what about this and
[47:50] what about that I love to help you find
[47:52] it you come to me and have some
[47:56] argumentative form that you want to
[47:58] argue with me about you know what I'll
[48:00] do I'll help you find quotes that looks
[48:03] like they've proven me wrong because
[48:06] once you read them and I say a couple of
[48:08] words you gonna turn off that page onto
[48:11] something else because you're gonna
[48:12] realize the answer is already there
[48:15] that's just - I'm sorry that's me if you
[48:19] have anything you said what's brother
[48:21] Dale he loves to study things that are
[48:24] controversial but wait on God you're not
[48:32] right around him say he wouldn't even
[48:33] preach on my way sir oh hell until it
[48:38] was revealed I did preach on the statue
[48:43] of prayer I mean on to the seals until
[48:47] it was revealed but I always quoted that
[48:53] quote to people you say you don't
[48:55] understand nothing about Daniel 7 new
[48:57] ways and what's the biggest problem
[48:58] we've had meetings on Daniel 70 weeks
[49:01] when they would be 20 ministers and
[49:03] eight or ten of and never read the
[49:05] message which they could tell you all
[49:08] about my brother Brian's name never read
[49:11] didn't even have a book I'm not joking
[49:16] we've seen a man right here stomp to
[49:19] hold the floor if I called his name
[49:23] everyone have you get up Wonka
[49:28] but listen motive random why are you
[49:33] saying when you've always touted you
[49:35] you've taught us the new birth was
[49:37] accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior
[49:40] you've taught us that the new birth is
[49:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:44] you taught us the baptism of the Holy
[49:47] Ghost is the seal of God you've taught
[49:50] us message after message honor these
[49:52] things why would you now say that you
[49:56] ain't got to hold a go maybe he's
[50:04] telling something about the Holy Ghost
[50:05] we ain't thinking about kind of make
[50:09] this a simple statement
[50:11] are you clear enough and work enough
[50:17] there's a simple answer to that question
[50:21] random why you mean any I still ain't
[50:24] got to hold a go if you're only a
[50:27] patient's you don't have the Holy Ghost
[50:30] the Upper Room experience of the 120 had
[50:36] it you don't have it like that that's
[50:43] simple did you follow it look a sample
[50:48] it is he's looking at the pyramid is to
[50:52] see it whether the disciples and what
[50:54] they had and then he's relating to where
[50:56] we are and he says you ain't got to hold
[50:58] a girl you ain't where they were simple
[51:08] these little kids understand that good
[51:14] luck
[51:19] look what he comes home down see what
[51:23] he's explaining it's a birth
[51:28] I've been birthed into this into this
[51:30] into this into this count them into Z
[51:33] into Z into Z into they 7 I think either
[51:36] 7 6 or 7
[51:37] look then the love of God Christ comes
[51:40] down and seals all that up in me for
[51:43] service now I'm going to drop a bomb and
[51:49] then back away okay ready
[51:54] what was the thing in the lady's dream
[51:57] that she had that the rock box wouldn't
[52:04] hold and it kept running over water
[52:10] right what a water represent the Holy
[52:15] Ghost but what it really represent the
[52:18] messenger pouring the message into the
[52:22] church you don't believe me read
[52:26] blaspheme his name cause if I don't
[52:27] finish what go into this next week got
[52:29] order listen it's a birth of in birth
[52:39] into this and then the love of God
[52:43] Christ comes in and seals you now that's
[52:50] where we've got to get right here on the
[52:53] message cuz we've got one more to finish
[52:55] and then we've got to go right here and
[52:58] some way find out what that true baptism
[53:03] of the Holy Spirit really is God brother
[53:10] Branham says there's a true baptism
[53:15] that's the seal
[53:19] just said it but I'll just back away
[53:20] from it so when I come back to it you'll
[53:23] say hey I remember it now you say you
[53:26] shouldn't do that why at least it makes
[53:29] you think you get all the answers you
[53:32] put it together and you'll have it
[53:33] you'll try to run on your own no worry
[53:36] about but look think about it what about
[53:45] a statement like this now I may miss it
[53:49] a word so just I'm trying to court off
[53:51] memory the Holy Ghost coming down
[53:54] through Christ's Holy Spirit but rather
[54:03] made a lot of statements that not he was
[54:10] wrong he was proving how wrong we was
[54:14] because what was his emphasis on
[54:16] blasphemous names these emphases on
[54:19] blasphemous names was what we're ready
[54:22] to you a couple of weeks ago the baptism
[54:25] of the Holy Ghost is not correctly
[54:27] talked oh it stalled he said like
[54:31] baptism he said like a car's got spark
[54:34] plugs and this and that and the other he
[54:37] said but it's not correctly talked I say
[54:41] you got the baptism the hose I got the
[54:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost just exactly
[54:47] like the disciples had under their
[54:51] Pentecost unquote brother Adam he said
[54:54] we did but now remember on the day of
[54:58] Pentecost there was two things taking
[55:02] place one was a group of 120 that had
[55:07] been tutored for three and a half years
[55:09] the second part is a group that heard
[55:12] one message one got the baptism of the
[55:16] Holy Ghost where it says Holy Spirit on
[55:18] the pyramid the other one got the
[55:20] baptism with the Holy Ghost where it
[55:22] says faith well I don't know her brother
[55:24] branham said dad or not well okay that's
[55:29] no problem with me
[55:32] it's always held me pretty good but
[55:34] that's alright you don't want to believe
[55:35] it gentlemen but look what is the profit
[55:39] trying to explain when he said the Holy
[55:44] Ghost is not correctly taught you know
[55:47] what he said in blasphemous names about
[55:49] that he said people teach that you get
[55:51] baptizes and when he said one of them
[55:53] even baptized in the water
[55:54] he said when I'm speaking in tongues one
[55:57] of them is doing this one of them doing
[55:58] that all those times is taught by the
[56:00] church world as the baptism in the Holy
[56:03] Ghost and he says none of them are
[56:05] correct so only the born-again believer
[56:15] of this endtime message really knows
[56:17] what the new birth is and he like Alan I
[56:25] love it
[56:27] only the born-again believer of this
[56:31] endtime message knows what the mark of
[56:34] the beast is knows what serpent seed is
[56:38] knows what Daniel 7 new exists knows
[56:41] what the seals are knows what the new
[56:43] Burkhardt
[56:44] knows what predestination is did I state
[56:47] it correctly only the born-again
[56:49] believers true born-again believers you
[56:54] realize how wonderful that ought to make
[56:57] you to think that God has thought so
[57:00] much of you to allow you to be able to
[57:03] feast upon his word and to not be
[57:08] confused you were the lady she said she
[57:15] wondered whether she had to hold a ghost
[57:16] or not I can prove by blasting his name
[57:18] brother in said she had it she still
[57:21] wondered where she had there not but you
[57:26] don't want even how to dream about it
[57:29] wondering if she had it you know what to
[57:32] dream was the dream was the answer to
[57:34] her that she had it
[57:39] the dream was the answer to the woman
[57:41] that she had it brother branham finished
[57:44] and finalized it hmm and when he comes
[57:47] down to it I got it right in here
[57:49] he said God accepted her foundation
[57:55] what's her foundation what is all our
[58:00] foundation faith the new birth the new
[58:07] birth is faith what about a church why
[58:12] are we afraid to be to make statements
[58:21] why is it there we're confused when
[58:27] brother Branham is explaining eternal
[58:29] life the conversion he said but the
[58:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost push you into
[58:37] the body of Christ subject to the gifts
[58:40] for service it doesn't make you any more
[58:43] of a Christian then what's he talking
[58:50] about
[58:54] they said the baptism with the Holy
[58:56] Ghost don't don't make you more don't
[58:57] make you no more Christian well I
[59:01] thought about their tomatoes Christian
[59:03] you mean listen to what he's talking
[59:04] about he's up in the statue of a perfect
[59:08] man looking at things from the depth of
[59:10] God's Word to seeing those disciples and
[59:13] the way they see it
[59:21] what about it let's see if I can find
[59:26] this other one number four you must be
[59:36] born again and now I'm saying this and
[59:41] know what's going on tape I want to say
[59:45] this to the passengers that will perhaps
[59:47] receive this tape I suppose maybe just a
[59:54] little what I suppose maybe just a
[1:00:00] little different from what the regular
[1:00:03] Church teaches I teach and believe and
[1:00:09] believe can sufficiently proved by the
[1:00:13] scripture that you're born of the Spirit
[1:00:17] and then baptized into the body by the
[1:00:22] Holy Spirit what your prophet said that
[1:00:29] he was different from everybody else
[1:00:30] about he surely is he's different to the
[1:00:34] people of this message in trying to do
[1:00:36] it cuz they aren't gonna accept that you
[1:00:45] think they're gonna listen to that
[1:00:46] statement he says he couldn't prove it
[1:00:49] by the scripture that you're born to the
[1:00:52] Spirit and then baptized into the body
[1:00:57] what about him
[1:01:05] what about these things if Christ has
[1:01:14] closed us with the Holy Spirit and been
[1:01:17] adopted into the family after being born
[1:01:20] again and been baptized into the body by
[1:01:25] the Holy Spirit it's a true witness of
[1:01:29] God as adopted been adopted into the
[1:01:37] family after being born again that
[1:01:44] exactly what I don't understand this is
[1:01:47] one thing I don't understand I'm sorry
[1:01:48] to even say it cuz you don't take the
[1:01:50] signal you're I don't understand that
[1:01:52] dummies in this message that all they
[1:01:54] can find is a little bitty nitpick in
[1:01:55] time if I was wanting to find some
[1:01:58] things that would make it look like
[1:02:00] brother Branham didn't know what he's
[1:02:01] talking about there's a lot of things
[1:02:04] that can be found but with the Holy
[1:02:07] Spirit and let him put it together it's
[1:02:10] the most beautiful story there is
[1:02:14] because it has no loophole trying to
[1:02:20] make it just briefly plenty doesn't know
[1:02:23] how to make it you believe on the Lord
[1:02:27] Jesus Christ you then have the new birth
[1:02:32] when you believe on the Lord Jesus you
[1:02:36] receive a new thought a new life but it
[1:02:40] isn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost see
[1:02:43] you got the new birth when you believe
[1:02:46] you got eternal life it's a gift of God
[1:02:51] that's gift to you through Sovereign
[1:02:54] Grace by accepting the gift that God is
[1:02:58] giving to you and he that heareth my
[1:03:01] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:03:04] hath eternal life has everlasting life
[1:03:08] that's the new birth you're converted it
[1:03:13] means you're you turned around
[1:03:16] the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you
[1:03:19] into the body of Christ subject to the
[1:03:22] gifts for service it doesn't make you
[1:03:28] any more of a Christian it just puts you
[1:03:33] into the body now see adoption adoption
[1:03:45] does not make you any more of a child of
[1:03:48] God than the birth you receive natural
[1:03:53] adoption if you adopting the child it
[1:03:55] makes it no more when it's adopted but
[1:04:04] we don't want to read brother Branham
[1:04:06] but yet you tell me you're just too
[1:04:09] intellectual you do this well why don't
[1:04:12] you get up here and read I'm not trying
[1:04:17] to be sarcastic or aggravating or
[1:04:19] anything show off with what I am or
[1:04:21] smart oh it's been that way all of my
[1:04:22] life slight worried about it you think
[1:04:24] what you won't do about me but did your
[1:04:27] prophet say it did he say I can prove
[1:04:32] you're born again and then baptized into
[1:04:36] the body do you believe that now
[1:04:49] question number two
[1:04:51] can you explain that can you explain
[1:05:08] turn alive when you believe but here's
[1:05:11] what we fail to finish reading he said
[1:05:13] when you truly believe you don't leave
[1:05:17] no loopholes he just got to keep reading
[1:05:19] he said if you truly believe in see I'm
[1:05:27] trying to get you to look at a point he
[1:05:30] tells you you come all the way up here
[1:05:31] to godliness think and and now you're
[1:05:35] perfect comes to patience and says now
[1:05:37] you ain't even got the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:42] he's done told you you got to hold it
[1:05:43] ghost when you're born again
[1:05:46] see that's adoption he's teaching that's
[1:05:50] the same thing as a baby in the natural
[1:05:53] born into the family and then adopted
[1:05:56] into the family he's born into the
[1:06:01] family he's a part of the family within
[1:06:04] he's adopted into the family who's
[1:06:06] recently placed now listen so you're
[1:06:12] born again by believing on the Lord
[1:06:14] Jesus Christ accepting him as your
[1:06:16] Savior and believing in him giving you
[1:06:19] eternal life in your soul which is the
[1:06:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:23] the new birth but then your positionally
[1:06:29] placed in the body of Christ for the
[1:06:33] gifts that go with you brother Branham
[1:06:37] says I've got it in here somewhere
[1:06:39] he says if you're in the body you've got
[1:06:43] to have one of the gifts to be in the
[1:06:45] body so everybody's got to give to some
[1:06:48] kind so you're born again by believing
[1:06:55] on the Lord Jesus Christ and accept him
[1:06:56] as your Savior
[1:06:57] that gives your soul eternal life and
[1:07:00] then you are placed in the body of
[1:07:03] Christ for gifts you're placed into the
[1:07:10] body for what you're supposed to be an
[1:07:13] adult trained child what is the natural
[1:07:16] story Paul Paul is taking the natural
[1:07:19] story of adoption
[1:07:22] that a child is adopted into the family
[1:07:24] and in that they adopt their earning a
[1:07:27] natural story back there in Poland there
[1:07:30] adopt their own children they don't make
[1:07:32] them a child to adopt them they're born
[1:07:36] the child you are born again by the
[1:07:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost which gives
[1:07:41] you eternal life making you a child of
[1:07:43] God but then positionally placed in the
[1:07:48] body by adoption why can't we see that
[1:07:53] that makes the message so simple it
[1:08:00] makes the things the Prophet said to
[1:08:01] score why you don't you don't and don't
[1:08:05] hit in your mind that you can read it a
[1:08:07] prophet would say I can prove you're
[1:08:09] born again then baptized into the body
[1:08:11] that don't go boom in your brain maybe
[1:08:16] that's what's wrong with my knee shakes
[1:08:17] it too much but that's thing that
[1:08:21] wouldn't preach on until God revealed it
[1:08:22] to me I wouldn't preach about those
[1:08:26] things until God revealed it to me now
[1:08:30] don't worry about preaching it because I
[1:08:32] believe it and see I steady and steady I
[1:08:40] spend my time instead of like you and
[1:08:42] then I get ridiculed about it we're in
[1:08:46] the the Bible study the other night
[1:08:49] Wade looked up on the computer I tried
[1:08:51] it I can find a certain thing but I used
[1:08:54] to make the statement and people just
[1:08:57] look at you I don't really know where it
[1:08:59] comes from the old Baptist days cuz we
[1:09:01] talk about adoption you ain't never
[1:09:03] heard a Baptist preached on adoption
[1:09:05] that adoption is the adopting into the
[1:09:08] family was the new birth to be brought
[1:09:10] you into the family we Baptist taught
[1:09:12] them things
[1:09:21] you don't pay attention if you're
[1:09:30] adopted into the family listen this is
[1:09:33] what what I was gonna say cuz I know it
[1:09:34] was there now I can prove it
[1:09:39] adoption is not a doctrine taken from
[1:09:45] Israel it is not an Israeli point it is
[1:09:53] a adopted are brought into from the
[1:09:57] Romans and the Greeks they had the dots
[1:10:01] in there it is not started by the the
[1:10:04] Israel the waters are started by Israel
[1:10:08] it was picked up by the things that will
[1:10:11] come along in the way when they was
[1:10:13] dwelling with his you know with the
[1:10:15] Romans let's see we don't even think
[1:10:22] like that now adoption breast God that
[1:10:24] God's him that adoptions in the Bible it
[1:10:27] was in Israel had adoption I like to
[1:10:33] talk to you about it
[1:10:36] Jacob had had many kids well that right
[1:10:43] and wouldn't Jacob had to 12 kids
[1:10:48] Reuben was the oldest did a Reuben did
[1:10:51] Reuben get adopted into the family
[1:10:58] there's only one out of the family that
[1:11:01] had any form of thoughts of adoption but
[1:11:03] don't you tell me a Reuben wasn't
[1:11:04] adopted when he come to that 13 years of
[1:11:07] age or 14 so he was adopted into the
[1:11:09] family but there's only one out of the
[1:11:12] twelve that had any sign of a New
[1:11:16] Testament form of adoption and that's
[1:11:18] Joseph when he got the coat of many
[1:11:20] colors now you're bringing adoption in
[1:11:27] to understand it see that's the way I
[1:11:31] study things to try
[1:11:33] to make sure that I'm right not if
[1:11:34] somebody come along you up speaking hey
[1:11:36] hey brother Dale you know that adoption
[1:11:39] was was not an Israeli doctrine
[1:11:42] yes bless God a word I have you
[1:11:45] understand no I just blowin my own but
[1:11:51] if he says that and I say yes brother
[1:11:54] who as you explained to me adoption in
[1:11:57] the Old Testament because you only have
[1:11:59] one time that you can even use it as a
[1:12:01] type of it and that's Joseph the coat of
[1:12:04] many colors
[1:12:04] the guy can't say nothing because he
[1:12:07] knows what you're talking about is the
[1:12:08] truth see the Word of God is straight
[1:12:11] brother branham knew what he was doing
[1:12:15] he said when you're born into the family
[1:12:18] you're just as much a member of the
[1:12:20] family as you'll ever be and because
[1:12:23] you're adopted into that family don't
[1:12:26] make you no more a member of that family
[1:12:29] it just positionally places you that's
[1:12:34] the statue of a perfect man you're born
[1:12:37] again by the new birth into the body of
[1:12:39] Christ under 20 got the Holy Ghost up
[1:12:43] here cuz they were tutored and trained
[1:12:45] 3,000 got it down here as babies it's
[1:12:49] the same new birth it's just a depth art
[1:12:53] a part of what God is indwelling each
[1:12:57] one with he taught those disciples three
[1:13:00] and a half years tutored him and trying
[1:13:03] to that still didn't make him a
[1:13:06] born-again Christian he opened their
[1:13:09] eyes to the understanding of the
[1:13:10] Scriptures as we bring in this morning
[1:13:11] for the Book of Luke that didn't make
[1:13:13] him a Christian he breathed on them and
[1:13:16] said receive ye the Holy Ghost that
[1:13:19] didn't make him a Christian they had to
[1:13:22] go to the upper room and wait on the
[1:13:24] Holy Ghost to come then when they did
[1:13:27] they were brought into the family
[1:13:29] because listen this is one it's going to
[1:13:31] slap you in the face if we ever get
[1:13:32] there
[1:13:33] adoption if you're going to use it you
[1:13:35] realize a Gentile adoption was not far
[1:13:39] the Gentile the Bible says
[1:13:45] adoption was for Israel Gentiles were
[1:13:50] dogs the new birth adopted us into the
[1:13:56] family of God then the Holy Ghost will
[1:14:03] position us as the growth development
[1:14:05] comes it will position us in the family
[1:14:08] into the gills and the authorities in
[1:14:12] the you know the world will come out to
[1:14:14] be a manifested son and daughter of God
[1:14:22] he said well you sure don't teach us
[1:14:24] nothing brother Dale to try to make us
[1:14:26] feel good and try to make us believe
[1:14:29] this then if I can ever get you to
[1:14:30] believe who you are you want to worry
[1:14:32] about nothing now and we ever realized
[1:14:35] who we are don't you worry about
[1:14:36] anything yeah that's what your prophet
[1:14:38] says that when the bride realizes who
[1:14:40] she is
[1:14:40] she'll be in what invincible army now
[1:14:47] that's not invisible you know it means
[1:14:55] undefeatable why because she's part of
[1:15:00] the family why because what does these
[1:15:05] virtues do come on musician what does
[1:15:07] these virtues do they place you
[1:15:08] positionally in the family or gifts as
[1:15:14] to what you're supposed to be child
[1:15:18] training gifts when we get to the next
[1:15:23] time wait a week strike a steady a
[1:15:25] little bit on this
[1:15:26] steady on brotherly kindness and how
[1:15:28] they bestow honey it's the honey of
[1:15:34] brotherly kindness will hold when the
[1:15:37] rest won't hold that's what your
[1:15:41] prophets
[1:15:49] see when he makes a lot of statements we
[1:15:51] need to sit down and cap under those
[1:15:53] statements but Renan what in the world
[1:15:59] do you mean true baptism on the whole we
[1:16:00] go well now now what I think that is
[1:16:03] that's an only one though here no that
[1:16:06] ain't what he's talking about
[1:16:12] anointed ones are anointed with the true
[1:16:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost but it is not
[1:16:17] the very nature of Almighty God it's
[1:16:21] just an anointing for their time
[1:16:27] godliness don't sit on anointed ones
[1:16:35] anointed ones are not perfect
[1:16:44] they just got an anointing with the
[1:16:49] bride of Jesus Christ their true
[1:16:50] born-again believer she's perfect
[1:16:52] let's stand together well we got page
[1:16:56] 389 it is well with my soul 389 anybody
[1:17:00] have a need the altars open
