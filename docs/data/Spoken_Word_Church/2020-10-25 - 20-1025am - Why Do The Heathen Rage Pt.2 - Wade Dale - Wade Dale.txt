========================================

everybody [Music] hey everybody let's give him a hand clapping pray god bless you amen i love those songs that are bride specific man they all are but that one is really talk about our age right here where we're at so god bless you good to be in the house with lord good to have everybody here today we got a full house as full as we can get good to see brother and sister dale back there in the back we got to start moving him toward the front people get them out of the back back there hey man good to be in the house of the lord brother terrence is on him he's doing good he's outside um watching in he and sister lisa so just keep them in your prayers everything's good we're all heading in the right direction and wednesday night brother louise will be speaking for us on wednesday at seven o'clock we'll do this again next sunday at 10 just like we did before until we give you further notice but um brother john and sister alicia we they called about the mother there the other day and it's just the separation time and but we know that we had a prophet go back into the cur across the curtain of time and he just kind of wiped out all fear all fear of death of what's going of what's going to happen with that little sting if so that happens but we're going to be doing the service at 11 o'clock on wednesday and atlanta brother john will get the directions for us and we'll be speaking down there wednesday at 11 so thank you for doing that we appreciate anytime we can help be any help of anyone and we appreciate the lord for letting us have another week another time another time to come to service i i say smiling faces but some of you i can't see so make your eyes smile that's the way to do it that zoe black back then her whole face smiles so you can see when she's smiling their eyes are all smiling god bless you good to be in the house of the lord we're going to one more we're going to do one more part on the why do the healing rage let's turn to the book of psalms this will be part two and then we'll get back on to the two spirits you know i was thinking yesterday we are talking about two spirits because there's one influencing you or the other one of the two and then sometimes both of them are amen because we're still humans but we as being human beings though and and we're not and i like what brother branham said he said you know he said god is a segregationalist we don't segregate by color or any but we segregate by family by christianity by by as the song said sons and the daughters of god not everybody is the son and daughter of god not by not by genetic birth by the new birth everybody son and daughter of god by birth but not by the new birth that puts you in another category and god puts you in that category so under that we see that the world is going to rage but this part too will look coming over into death but we look over here and we see that that still there is that second power that's working today in here to try to get you to disbelieve the word of god all right and but what he's doing though is what i was thinking he's getting you to disbelieve the word of god by believing part of the word of god he satan has never said this bible is wrong no but what he done was come down like we were talking about nicea he came down into those men and diluted and polluted and added to the written word with no holy spirit revelation which was satan's revelation of the trinity and all the different things all the different false doctrines and then that man satan has now moved over into the message of the hour and he's teaching false doctrine again so uh we're still dealing with him but i still want to cover this again i uh brother uh what brother call you read we're gonna read another one in psalms three uh but the book of psalms is is really important to me to see your life because david as we were talking talk about last sunday and what we're going to talk about again david was anointed to be king he knew it he had a revelation he knew he was the only one there's not ever been two kings of israel there's only been one all right so he knew he was going to be king and then he comes up and he and he has all these troubles and trials and and you know he's a great conqueror he kills de la goliath but he has problems with saul and we'll get into that in a minute one minute battles but he was drove out of his kingdom as a rejected king and uh this is where we look and see that that you and i today if you get nothing else get this you and i are anointed to be king and princes of this earth revelation 5 tells us the whole bible tells us that we're coming back to an eating condition and we're to rule and reign on this earth all right but this is temporary then you're going to let we're going to let the heathen rage we're going to let the heathen do what they want to do but when we come back back to the bottom line this is our earth this is ours we came from this earth we came from the spoken word of god back in genesis 1 and as adam ruled and reigned the earth with eve the bride of jesus christ with jesus christ is going to rule and reign for an eternity so god bless you let's bow our heads just for a moment remember all the ones that are sick many different ones there's other churches now that are that are dealing with the virus so um we pray that they will they will overcome the heavenly father we thank you for the day that you give us the hour that we're living in and for a good church to go to and the good family lord church family to be a part of we pray lord now that you would sanctify us for this journey be with us lord in the futh anoint to hear his lord but anoint the speaker father so that you can do the speaking to the people and lord they'll get something from you today and it'll not just be a meeting of minds and different things but lord we will hear straight from you father we pray that you just heal the sick be with the ones that are not here lord anoint the ones for our journey that we're in be with the little bride around the world the different ones in the foreign fields we've all kind of all been cut off where we can't see each other much but we can talk and lord we know there's one thing for sure we miss each other lord we miss even the fellowship here lord as being downstairs and being distancing in the in the pews today lord we know we've we're scattered in the way that the world sees it but lord we should be united more under you father united under the word of god what the word says not what man says so lord just be with us today in the furthem of this service in jesus name we pray amen psalms 2 verse 1 says why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing because what is all this world it's all vanity nothing you can depend on wealth economy economics presidents politics the only one thing you depend on that's the word of god amen and that's what david did because his absolute came back to i'm going to be a king so whatever happens but he was still human and i was reading the other night where he would lay across his bed and he says my bed is wet with my tears crying out to god for his people and for deliverance and for the things that he needed as a human and that's the same way with we are now doing the same thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us but i like this part he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision there's your promise you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word let's read psalms 18 1 as we enter into this for for david's life and we can put many other people's lives in here and we can we see that jesus comes up to the pharisees and and when he was here he comes up to the religious leaders of the day and he said well what's the difference in you persecuting me and persecuting my people you persecuted my prophets back in the old testament because jesus christ christ was in those prophets so jesus knew what he that what the religious people of the world had done to them back in the old testament or back in the prophetic time of isaiah look at isaiah isaiah was a wonderful prophet he was a young man but they cut him asunder they cut him in pieces because he was a prophet many different people during the time and and jesus was not wondering he said well don't worry if they hate you they hated me in those prophets and now they've hated me more because i'm standing here i was reading yesterday in luke where they hated him because he called himself the son of god because because the religious world knew that he was saying i'm not a second person i'm god almighty in human flesh and that's what they hated him for and that's what they're going to hate you for amen so when we look at this and we see why do the heathen rage i hope you got something last week that that that we're talking about yeah i'm talking about the guy that that you know as an example you walk through walmart or you come outside of walmart and you you know you're in this big cloud of of marlboro smoke and and the guy's just puffing away you know and he's feeling fine and he's going to go get his beer and he's going to go home and he's feeling fine but yet some of the bride of jesus christ are struggling with disease and struggling with this virus and struggling with the different things and sometimes it makes you wonder kind of like david because that was the question why do in other words lord why are these people so successful right why does it seem like the guy that smokes a cigarette you know has copd and i'm just making it all worse he's got you know he's he's 200 pounds overweight yet he never gets to virus you wonder that i mean you but but as christians you have to know one thing's for sure the footsteps of the righteous the order of the lord and i'll read you a quote in just a few minutes where brother brown says these light effect afflictions that are put on us are for our good amen if you believe but now see you can get on the other side and be the old woe was me while he was you were why is god doing this to me right because that's kind of what david was lord why do the heathen rage in other words why are they overtaking my kingdom why is my own son taking over my kingdom why is he why am i having to go set up on the top of a mountain somewhere and and look down on jerusalem and there's my kingdom and that the way me and you look you know brother brown and walked through the woods one day and found a cigarette pack and they picked it up and and the power of god gave him a sermon from it but i'm sure what brother branham was doing just like we do and i can't stand for anybody to throw anything out of a window and there's trash all over this is just me human i'm just talking right now all right it just throw something out the window and you see all this stuff on the side of the road right you know why because it's my property and thank god he's going to burn it off where that'll all burn and it will be ashes the prophet of god said in malachi 4 under the souls of our feet when we walk out into the millennium there won't be a cheeseburger wrapper and lottery tickets we're gonna have to step over i'm telling you i used to cut grass there at the city and a couple years ago and used to it was you know cigarette packs and beer cans now it's um now it's uh what's that's that red bull and lottery tickets or whatever monster it's all them energy drinks that people got enough energy to throw it out the window and the lottery ticket you know that people now are going back and picking them up again trying to look and see if somebody missed something you see how the world's gone insane you know and it's just that way but but we've polluted the world like brother brown said we have whatever advancement we've ever made cars planes trains whatever it is we've always went toward the messing up part but you and i must look at this this is my property and while i'm here i'm going to do the best i can this is i'm just giving you a little admonition try to make something better than when you left you know i you know me or i've told you before if i go through walmart and i see something laying on the floor i don't just kick it under the thing i'll pick it up and set it up on the shelf that's just me i go through the post office and somebody throw the letter down or they something i pick it up because i want to make something better that's just humanity but why not in the gospel should we be the same way that we should be crying out as we were reading in in romans where the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of the sons of god well listen the world's got to get bad before we can start manifesting ourselves the world's got to get bad why would you need to be have a manifestation of the sons of god when you got gas in your tank you got a 50 000 automobile you got a good job making a lot of money and why do you need manifestation of the sons of god that's just natural living like they're doing out there yes but when you need god is when somebody like david says lord why is this happening to me but anytime that does happen to david watch this right here psalms 18 1. now look at the caption there it says to the chief musician the psalm of david the servant of the lord look who spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemy he said it was a time that david had took over all of his enemies there was a time when he was delivered from the hand of saul he said i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler in the horn of my salvation and my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies listen do not worry do not fear the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid whatever's happening out there that's ungodly whatever's happening up there out there in the world that's an ungodly world out there even though they may say they're christians and they may say that they believe in god but the devil does the same thing all right so be careful when you say this person he knows of god but we know god amen there's a lot of people knows of jesus christ but there's not many people that have an intimate relationship with him like we do amen and that he has one back to us this is not just a one-way street amen because that's what david said lord here i am but so i shall be saved from mine enemies though i become passed about he said one time the sorrows of hell compass me about verse five the snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the lord isn't it really easy to get complacent and have all those things in life yeah and you just say them little short prayers i'm going to talk to you today and you're saying them little short prayers lord bless us all you know that's good i've got everything going in the right direction just bless me see you bye but when you cry out to the lord when you have adversity when you have a lot of things going on in your life it makes for them long prayers it makes for them prayers that are what that have a little more i say more meaning to them than they did before because david he right there at the first he was anointed to be king you know what he'd done he went right back out and started herding sheep right yeah but there was a seed planted i talked about that seed the other day it's not a seed of anything but a seed of the word of god he got a word from samuel now remember he didn't have a bible to read per se he had the torah he knew what moses said but here david i don't think he walked out there and said all right i'm going to be this great king and i'm going to write this book of psalms and i'm going to have a son named son god don't tell you everything when you start your journey you know what he does he wants to see if you believe what he's already said there's the whole thing he wants to make sure you believe and it's ingrained in your heart not this heart in your in your in your inner being he wants to make sure that you understood what he said the first time all right then that's what he did with david david understood not that his brothers not even that saul now remember saul was chosen by israel to be king amen but god chose what man chose saul right god chose david don't know who you're going to take whose side are you going to take on that one amen god chose david drew samuel an anointed prophet for that day so why can't you be the same thing why can't you be the anointed kings and priest that believes what god said to you through a prophet that gave you an anointing to leave this world with to do something nobody's ever done before and it's take a body change but we've got to get past the white of the heathen rays we got to get past the wilds he will say why is this happening to me why is god doing this to me well i'll read you a few things here in just a little while because david even in verse six look in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into my ears then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was roth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down in darkness was under under his feet just because david a child of god cried out to god he moved heaven and earth to come down there and talk to him now you got to believe the sign thing that god moved heaven and earth to talk to you amen psalms 37 verse 23 says the steps of a good man are ordered of the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall that just alleviates all the fall every time you fall get back up though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor seed begging for bread we've been through some narrow places before we know all of us have but god's never been so far away that you can't contact him he is right there even david when david said lord why does the heathen rage who was he talking to who was he talking to god because god was in the room with him who do you think he's thought he's not talking to the heathen he's not talking to the devil he's asking god a question and where was god he was standing right there same way with you and i it's okay to question the things that go on it's okay to question certain things that are happening in your life but remember who are you talking to when you question them you're talking to the almighty you're talking to your daddy he's standing right there listening to what you got to say even though we may be in the wild he wows he woo he's still going to go hey i'm right here i mean who do you talk to when you pray who do you talk to when you pray are you just praying out in the air is it just something that a ritual that you do that you say well i'm gonna just say something maybe maybe somebody will hear what i said no right there david he's telling us the one before that he said i cried out to the lord and he heard my prayer you say oh god hadn't heard my prayer in years oh please oh please you're alive you're sitting here you're listening to the word of god you're doing something that most people would give uh brother bob and i were talking the other day you know this is something that we have that you know bill gates and all the real rich men of the world you think boy they're great they're powerful and they are they got billions of dollars but would you trade places with him oh but i could take this bit see that's the devil i could take this billions of dollars and i could build churches and i could take the message all around the world no your money would catch up with you whatever bill gates has got and i'm just saying here all any rich people in the world they have zero to what you have because they're going they know they know they're coming to an end of life and they don't have a clue if they're not born again they don't have a clue what's going to happen and he can't take that money with him but what you've got he can have if he wants it but he you got something that he can't touch and i know i'm just trying to get everybody's head here that's kind of hard strange there's a lot of room for some of us to get in their head but we look and we see though we give honor and we know we give honor to the you know we honor the president of the united states we honor all these different men all right because of the position that they hold even when you're working in a job the bible tells you if you're a servant that you do what your master tells you to do even the bible tells us that we're supposed to be that right right okay so that's just human that's just us being that makes us different from everybody else you know somebody said the other day said now the way people are working that to get employee of the month you just have to show up for two days in a row in a row two days not two months or two weeks two days so that's how the job markets got i want you to be a better person than anybody that ever has worked for whoever or whatever you understand what i'm saying because look that's the riches that i'm talking about that was the riches that god saw david was had an honest and a contrite heart david was trying his best without the baptism of the holy ghost in his soul he had an anointing he was anointed with the same thing that you're living with every day inside of you and david still he questions god but that's okay god didn't look at that god looked at why he was doing what he did david wanted to be right that's right do you want to be right i want to be a right person just even in my humanity i want to be and we fail every day but we surely for sure we want to be what god wants us to be not what man but what god wants us to be let's look at psalms 27 verse 1. excuse me we're going to read some scripture today just like we did last week that's all right with you i like reading scripture yes psalms 27 verse 1 a psalm of david the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid now now here's david in psalms 27 and i know they're not written all in chronological order but in psalms 2 he says lord why does that heathen rage but now this is something you and i stay awake would you please good grief stay awake this is worth more than any back of your eyelids we ever show you okay of whom shall i be afraid now david has worked through something same way with you and i in our journey we work sometimes we we get down in the pits and we say why does the heathen rage and why is everything happening to me well do what but we've got to come to a day of psalms 27 whom shall i fear amen the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell wow what about that though in holy and camp against me my heart shall not fear now that doesn't mean you're not going to have a little maybe they call butterflies human butterflies you understand everybody's had them before because of of the uncertain because of the unseen but you must do like david said he put his heart the inward part of him he put at rest the war should rise against me what about somebody like david he was a man of war he physically went out and fought people and could have died i was thinking this morning i i couldn't have been a general in the confederate army or any army because you know there's there's a certain amount of death you're you're you're sending people out to battle and you know some of them's not coming back right so it's a certain there's a certain fear there even with you as being talking about david here there's a certain fear because of war is so uncertain but what did he do in this will i be confident the war should rise against me in this will i be confident one thing amen one thing that i have did one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after what that i may dwell in the house now remember last sunday we were talking about house that house is not a house it's a domain it's a dominion in my father's house are many mansions and back in the old times and even now still in in england and different places they have a a house which would be the house of commons they have a house of of roberts they have a house of dale they have it's your domain it's what you it's what you're over to protect so that's what he said i will dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life because remember david didn't physically stay in the house of the lord all the days of his life he didn't go running get in the temple and sit down that's not what he's talking about what i'll dwell in the blessings i'll dwell in the blessings of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble like i said before brother branham preached the rapture message and he used this right here for the time of trouble he shall hide me in what his pavilion not yours he'll hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle what revelation see this is a secret bride this is a secret revelation just like the song was talking about the seek the revelation but now we know the revelation has been opened we're living under an open book now amen and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies around about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing hard to get some of y'all to do that i will sing praises unto the lord hear o lord when i cry with my voice you know i go back to different places and you see david remember what david was david was a he he wrote songs and when saul would have a bad spirit saul saul in 2020 would have a bad spirit right right he called david and that anointing walked right in there with david and he would play and what the bible say the evil spirits would go away from saul right make your day better if you sing a few songs just saying i want to make this thing better not worse for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion verse six and now my head will be lifted though now shall my head be lifted above my enemies around about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifice of joy i will sing yeah i will sing praises unto the lord hear o lord when i cry with my voice he doesn't mind if you cry that's right he wants you to ask yes he wants you to ask have mercy all upon also upon me and answer me when thou said it seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek hide not thy face far from me and put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord that's what we're doing today teach me thy way o lord and lead me in the plain path because of mine enemies david david is honoring his enemies for driving him to god because of mine enemies listen your enemies what's satan satan is your worst enemy but what is he doing the things god lets him do is driving a son and daughter of god to god that's right so your enemies are the best friends you'll ever have that's tough but you look through all the psalms because of mine enemies lord i will because because i have enemies it makes my friends much better teach me thy way o lord and lead me in plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over into the will of mine enemies for false witnesses or risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord you see there i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord into what land of the living in other words what he's doing all of his day wait on the lord that's our problem wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord all right let's go to isaiah 59 18. according to their deeds according he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the lord now where is the name of the lord it's in you and me that's what the world is missing the world is missing the name being associated with the name now oh lord they use that name many times but it's not a good way but you and i are totally eternally connected to that name so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood we know they're going to the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to where zion and to them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from henceforth and forever in other words it will never diminish even though we have been through denominations and we've been out in the world come through denominations and all the different places you just kept going right yeah and then god brings you right here to the message of the hour amen so it will not depart i like what brother brown said he said you know some old grandma great grandma got on her knees one day and said lord i want you to bless not only my seed i want you to bless my seed seed because you promised that you would continue on and then here you come right out of all that right out of all that chaos let's go to micah 7 7. therefore while i look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me rejoice not against me o my enemies when i fall i shall arise and when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me now do we really believe that amen because we go we go no lord it's so dark in here i know you're not here it's so dark in here i can't see anything i think when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light yes unto me i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold his righteousness how many of you have went through a journey and went through a battle and and said why does the heathen rage yet when you get to the other end of it as brother bob was talking about the other night you get to the end of of the enemy of what you're dealing with right then or a problem what do you do you look back and you go man thank you lord thank you lord because i was heading in the wrong direction or i would i had this wrong thought or this way i wanted to go this way and lord you put a little adversity in my way to train to change the course and lord that course was exactly what you wanted me to do that's why the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord ordered he has ordered a legion of angels we can't lose folks we cannot lose then she that is my enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her which said unto me where is the lord thy god my eyes shall behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets i remember remember brother uh gershon solomon was telling us um that when he was in the six day war that remember he was out there in the desert and he got um i think a tank ran over him or he was down low and the tank had run over the top of it and didn't run over him but he was out there and then here comes the whoever it is palestinians and they're running out there remember him telling the story if you haven't heard it you need to listen to it it's on youtube i think but he's he's he's a soldier and he's surrounded by these palestinians and he doesn't know if he's going to get captured or if they're just going to pow-pow and take care of him and he said all of a sudden they kind of look up and he said they drop their weapons and turn and run and the end of the story was that either he interviewed somebody that was in that platoon or he inter they something got the the um story got told that there was angels or people just rose up behind gershon solomon well now i'm telling you buddy the footsteps of the righteous you don't know that because you didn't see it now he didn't see it he was looking this way looking down a gun barrel i don't think he was thinking about a host of angels standing here but he said to look on those people's face and they said oh they were everywhere how many times that ever happened in your life where you look at something and you go how did that change well you weren't in another dimension where god was and he had those legions of angels watching after you amen because the footsteps of the righteous you know what that was a testimony if gershon's life would have ended right there that wouldn't have been a testimony but god wasn't finished with him he's still over there doing his work now in israel doing the things he needs to do because of what because of a little thing that he went through now that's not something you and i never been through that before i mean being a soldier in war knowing that you could die at any minute and that the host of your enemy was around you and their guns were pointed in your face oh we never been through that before but we've been through those little trials that you see that things have been changed and we don't know that well you don't know what's going on back here you don't know what's going on in another dimension let's listen to brother branham we read this last sunday we'll read it again number one smyrna church age unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign now i want you to keep that in your mind that listen god is not some mad person who is mad at you and he's he's got it out for you no but he knows you're a human being and being a human being we lean toward the carnal mind first and he knows that but he's that spiritual rudder inside of you needs a little every once in a while amen you want the wind to blow in another direction every once in a while so you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering think of the character building you've had in your life so far character is a victory not a gift so god's not going to gift you character he's going to gift you love joy peace longsuffering and all those different things because that's what the bible says but the bible says you're not going to get character it's not a gift character characters of victory now look look characters of victory doesn't say anything about a battle you didn't lose if you are victorious you won you got to look at these things what's what this what god's saying to us character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign think about god almighty that can just destroy this world by snapping his finger he can't do it because he's got character he can't do it because of what he said amen you say god can do anything nope brother said god can't do anything he can't do what his word didn't say he's got to do what his word said all right he can't change his word to so he can't change his mind he can't change what's going on a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic see thou what did god do he gave permitted power to lucifer told him you're the anointed cherub you're the one the cherub that covers you walk up and down the earth you do this you're my anointed you're my remember we talk you're my right hand guy he was given power though he didn't have the power he was given power [Music] and he has no character satan has no guard-like character so that's why a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and sat down in his father's throne now remember this is the overcomer in this age revelations 3 so this is our what we get our overcoming excuse me is to sit with him sit down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be what revealed in us when he comes how is he going to reveal himself through your life no other way except through your life he can't do it through words man has to take words and they've she's turned they've the world's turned it in all different ways so it's me and you in flesh it's the god in flesh that's going to destroy the effects of the devil oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through a little bit of tribulation oh that says much much tribulation think you're not strained concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that nobody is immune nobody is immune the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god hebrews 12 6 is for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth us and scourges every son whom he receiveth but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons now this special condition in smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it all right every church age went through some sort of persecution some sort of trial some sort of trouble there's no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god and it's not the will of god because he's just like i said he's a he's a sadist and he wants to just put everything he can on you no he knows what you need he knows the way we lean sorry but we do we lean toward the carnal mind first sorry we're just humans we were born that way but we've got to break out of that and then trust what god said which is not the carnal mind because the carnal mind is enmity with that or division it's it's it's against it this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long in his kind matthew 5 verse 11 12 blessed are you when man shall revile you oh i hate it when somebody says something bad about me he said blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely now there's your key if it's true he's telling the truth but if it's falsely then it's on him rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the what the prophets which were before you now here's a quote we were talking about last sunday the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god disapproval so don't sit down one day and say all this is happening on me i must not be a child of god don't ever say that amen neither are bright skies and still waters everything's going well paychecks coming in the door bills are getting paid we got good car we got oh we can go to walmart and buy a hundred dollars worth of groceries just groceries how many of you can get out of walmart without spending a hundred dollars y'all lying yeah you i'm not talking about you i'm not about christine never raised her hand i mean really but you see what i'm saying about that's no persecution it's cause you can't buy by 50 worth of groceries but look so neither the bright skies and still water sign of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved now what is the beloved this is word his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know now how are you going to know that god loves you we shall know because he said so and where did he say so at he said so in the word amen and he manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself see that's the love of god is to give you an opportunity to be part of him oh that's a great opportunity folks goodness and manifest that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons not just bringing us in the foal but placing us you know in other words having some confidence in you to do what to do what the word said and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said not by signs by believing what he said and by conducting myself with what hatred i'm again oh i'm having these trials and god's so far away nope remember folks if you are going through a trial god is right there and he is the one orchestrating the thing because when you get through that trial he's going to cut that thing off he's not going to let satan just buff at you the whole time of your life on that one thing you've got something you got to get rid of lay it down lay it down and go on i'll promise you there's something else going to pop up so get rid of that one right then by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his what wisdom allows to come to pass thank you god you sent a prophet that could tell us exactly what you are thinking amen is that true yeah i mean you believe that all right let's go to romans 8 15 then for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption where you cry daddy daddy this is your entering your birth the spirit of self bearing witness with our spirit that we what are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we what suffer with him they might that we might be also glorified together for i reckon amen that the sufferings of this present time whatever you're going through are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature what waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god like i said before how are you going to become a manifested son of god without going through this building trial are these character building things then what to be a manifested son of god is when you don't have no food and you say god i need a pantry full of food i don't have gas in my tank i got to go pray for somebody i got something to do lord there's your manifestation you can and like i said you go and spend a hundred dollars every day at walmart just on groceries that ain't that's just manifesting you got a good job you see what i mean let's go to james five verse seven read some scripture here and then we'll read a few quotes that okay be patient therefore brethren okay right there it is be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husband will wait us for the precious fruit of the earth now you know what god planted the seed it just didn't automatically become a tree and start burning fruit process you got to go through that's right i've waited for about 11 years on my apple tree one of them to make bigger apples this year they made big apples 11 years though i planted that thing 11 years ago and i'm waiting i've been waiting i've been waiting i've been waiting and finally brother gabe i got some momma tell you we got some bigger apples but that big good old canning apple but i had to wait on it though i couldn't just go down there and say all right three years later you're nothing and you go in there and mow it down with a lawnmower no you had to have patience because you knew what you planted think of that god knows what he planted yes amen behold the husband waited for the precious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it until received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh grudge not one against another brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door look take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience that's like i said before james is talking about the well you've never been persecuted like they've been like they were persecuted you've never been persecuted like the prophets of the old you've never been persecuted like jesus was persecuted you've never been persecuted like peter james and john and all the different ones that gave their life that died by stoning that died by beheading that died by crucifixion amen all right that's first peter 2 19. for this is stateworthy if a man for conscious toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with god now who i mean wants to be acceptable with god we're right there's what it is for even here unto where were you called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again that's a problem for a lot of us when he suffered he threatened not i'll get you when i get done with this i know god's going to get me through this and when i do buddy you're in trouble no see that's a horrible attitude you'll never get through that see that's power without character but committed himself to him that judges righteously let's look at the layout of seeing church age brother brown says to him though he's reading revelation 3 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i overcome and i'm sitting down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask because that's what we're looking for well we got corona we got this we got there we go what do we what do we look it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it now that's so profound that god had to send us a prophet to say that that didn't come through confucius or buddha or that came from a prophet in the end time to tell us that and then when you read these things sometimes you know i think when brother branham was preaching all the theologians that's why he had a lot of problem with theologians because the theologians would be going he's just contrary to everything that we're we've been taught or are thinking but it's exactly what god wants us to hear right here because look what are we to overcome it is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome because we do like i said we have a laundry list well i overcome that i overcome this i can't overcome this i got this i got it it's not what you overcome it's how you did it but how we are to overcome now this is logical let's see they're all sitting there going this is illogical all the theologians all the carnal mind but this is the mind of god do you not know that that this is the mind of god talking to us through a prophet that's why they call it the voice of god recordings that's why they call it the voice of god sure it was the voice of william branham but it was god speaking through that voice now this is logical for does it matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look of these scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptation of satan by the word and by the word only in other words he didn't bring some kind of great uh he didn't just say all right devil you can't speak or he could have he had power over the devil we know that but how did he defeat him he defeated him by the word that way me and you can do the same thing amen me and you can quote the word back to the devil and by the word only and each of the three major trials that correspond exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word he knew what it was and he walked out anyway but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer what overcome by the word amen also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail now notice again how jesus overcame the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied what the word he was always quoting the old testament to him yeah it is written it is written it is written right problem is is they're going yeah we know but that's not what we're interpreting it as same way the people what about today same spirit was there then as here now he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the what wisdom of god all right let's right here speak to the rock 1953. there's no such thing as death to a christian that's why this we we come here to this and this is going to be close to the end we that's what i didn't get to last sunday we come to this part that we say oh all right well every we every trial we can handle every trial but boy there's death right there's no such thing as death to a christian there's not one scripture in the bible now what do you say take it back to the word there is not one scripture in the bible that tells you a christian dies who we're going to depend on the world or the word very much contrary we're all amen alive said he that believeth on me has everlasting life is that right how can it have an end if it's got everlasting see he that hears my word and believeth on me on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but look but has passed from death to life that's true so we can't die we cannot or can't cease to exist amen once you're born again of the spirit of god you can never ever cease to exist oh you can be separated in this dimension but you're just coming right back in here in a glorified condition will always be there was a time when you wasn't nothing or anything now watch here's another one that you can't get a scholar to say this but there was there never will be a time but what you'll be something in somewhere let me read that again there was a time when you wasn't nothing in other words you were in the mind of god you weren't just a thought in your parents mind didn't know you were coming didn't know your name didn't know if you were going to be male or female i understand what i'm saying because you came by natural birth but now that you're born again there will never be a time but what you'll be something and somewhere you've passed from death into life you're going to be somewhere from this all through ceaseless ages all eternity you'll be somewhere boy i like that that means you're not lost everybody else just lost means what they don't know where they're going and they surely don't know where they're going to end up right but boy we do don't we so now i just think about that sometimes when trials gets hard this is a prophet talking i hit snags in my life oh no brother branham you no i hit snags in my life like everybody some hard trials we have to pull hard to get through it you know sometimes we forget that brother brown tried to take his life a couple of times without the grace of god could have been a murderer he was going to shoot that boy he said i was going to shoot the boy he didn't say i was going to try to he said i was going to shoot the boy he was going to actually do something to that guy that poisoned his dog you see what i'm talking about he was human thank god he was human right but when i'm up against it i just think of this well what difference does it make that didn't get to you you're looking for something so profound and brother brown says when i'm up against something i just think well what difference does it make the bible said and he took it right back to the word all things work together for good to them that love him is that right so maybe it's for my good so i just go right ahead and take it anyhow oh boy we don't want that we don't want to take that this is what brother man's telling us and if i if it there's nothing can bother you even death itself can't bother you when death comes though out of the old prophet when they was building a scaffold out there to cut his head off why he said death where's thy sting grave where's my victory no sting to death no why where where where's your victory grave grave said i'll have you after a while i'll get you paul said what can you do to me that's it oh wait what are you gonna do to me well i'm already i'm already a child of god what are you going to do to me second corinthians 4 verse 15. for all things are for your sake that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god in other words we've got to all go through it for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day that's why folks we need these persecution we need something to remind us to pray a little harder to study a little harder to not say why me lord and we don't want to be where we say pour it on me lord right because we're human but we want that balance and the only one person knows that balance me and you do not know that balance god's the only one that knows that balance and he's got his foot on that rudder and he knows what we need and he knows when to let off for our light affliction this is second corinthians for a light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory you want the weight of the world or you want the weight of glory we got enough of the weight of the world right for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen or what temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal let's listen to this last quote when the musicians come i just want i just wanted to put these two sermons in here because i sat down one day and i just kind of put myself in david's place i'm an anointed king now he didn't get all puffed up about that right that's right i mean you know most people go well you're going to be the why not you brother donny but most people without the right character that'll make their head get about that big and even though he was a young boy he had to grow up to be a man he had to go through that character building most people would have run and jumped up on the throne and sat there and had saul killed and everybody else killed because bless god i'm king god told me i was king and i'm the king now listen you can't rule and reign like that but you know but listen folks the inward man does yes that's right the inward man but by character you hold that power i've always said many times before we come up to this place of speaking terms with god if you don't have the right kind of character if you don't like that guy if your neighbor's been giving you trouble or your boss has been giving you trouble or that person cuts you off on the side on the road and about runs you off the road you know what what you speak is what god's going to have to honor elisha and the she-bears the different things that's why power without character satanic but when you come to the power where you can hold that power back and not and not and not not let it be rage because that's what we get we get mad but see if you're on speaking conditions all you gotta do is say something wrong and you've done something wrong to somebody jesus christ could have stopped the crucifixion any time he wanted to he even told him he said i can bring a legion of angels and just wipe this you talking about romans and you talking about your army but what did he do he said i'm done i'm here to do a job and i'm not going to revile back i'm not going to say a word i know i can stop it but i'm not going to stop it because i got some i got some kids inside of me that needs to be birthed so what about me and you what about us having long suffering even with our own natural children and all the different people but i look right here but that's why i kind of came up with this and i hope it helps you some i hope it helps you in your daily life because we live our daily life a lot more than we live here amen now here's brother brown praying now lord heal the sick as they come up to be prayed for this morning give to them that joy that they long to be well let them know that this little light affliction was put upon them is just a little testing time god knows all about it he did it to see what you'd do about it he did it to see what you do we'd do about it how god may they step right out there and claim that finished work may they not provoke you by be running here and there and in and out well i don't know this that you know i don't know i don't know no you better start knowing something lord may they take a straight stand and say lord you was the one who saved me you was the one who did these things for me i believe you and i'm trusting in you today and i pray that you'll grant this to the people in christ's name amen he prayed this prayer right before he had a prayer line he was getting the people ready look he did it to see what we'd do about it may they step right out there and claim that finished work these light afflictions is just a little testing time god knows all about it sometimes we think we know more than god does sometimes we want to say well i don't know why this is i i know why this is happening i don't know what is that i don't know what this is i don't know what that is i don't know about this coronavirus i don't know about this i don't know about that it's a light affliction compared to what a lot of people are going through there's people in foreign countries now that that are beginning to starve because they're not getting any food from us or not us church but us the united states i was reading the other day let's stand our feet musicians come i was reading the other day one country their food's been cut off not their food all their food but the food for their children's school has been cut off and that's the only meal those children got in a day one meal that's all they got folks here we are we got candy in our pocket we got food in the car we got a pantry full we eat three meals a day and you've got countries that because of this coronavirus is not that's just not you know they're not they're not affect sorry they're not infected with it they are affected by it because we can't get stuff over there because of all the restrictions and all that there's children that are starving because they were dependent on that one meal at school that they ate and that's all they got the whole time so don't worry i mean we go through these light afflictions and when there's things that you know we're looking at a tough road ahead but you know what the tough get tougher amen we keep going you got to know that god knows what to do and he knows what you need we don't but god does he knows what we need for the hour and the light of fiction afflictions and trials that we're going through is to give god honor and glory i mean who are you going to give the devil honor oh my no no because look the devil would have killed job right at first if god would let him oh you got a hedge built around him right he's okay i'm gonna take that hedge off and let you get to his family and let you get to but what about him no god said no don't touch his life why he still had that hedge around his life he may have removed it from all of his personal things and god may do that to us but until god's done with us that hedge is right there around your soul that inward being that life in you is not a normal human life anymore i want you all to realize that now it doesn't make you so special like i said to make your head blow up but you are special to god you have a part to play a peace to play and you're part of the body of god and we can't lose we can't there's no way like like brother brown said there was a time you were nothing didn't know where he was going didn't know what she's going to do with your life but now that you're born again you'll never not be somewhere or have somewhere to go never so thank god for that even though the trials but remember don't we go back to that where he says what we overcome no it's how we overcome it so we overcome it by the word of god what he said about us and believe what he said doesn't matter come what may folks the bride of jesus christ will make it through we will make it through because he promised us by this word that someone will stand in the end time and say death not just even where's your sting that's all been done away with it'll say death you have no part with me even the temporary things we go through don't you think satan would want to kill every one of us look how he's attacking the ministry of the of the message of the hour making them making people sick and all these different things but it's like god did he said okay i'm just going to open this up just a little bit i'm going to show you what kind of character they got but you can't touch their soul you leave them alone you can do all these other things but you know what one day he's going to do he's going to close that back around and he's going to say they proved himself satan they've proved their self and you have no part with them let's sing a song god bless you we'll get back on the two two spirits i hope brother dale's ready next sunday to take a crack at it so we'll see understand why i am so happy and free we've crossed over jordan to cadence fireland and this is like heaven to me all this is like heaven to me [Music] this is like heaven to me i've crossed over jordan to canaan's fairland and this is like heaven to me listen oh when i get happy i sing and i shout the devil don't believe it i see but i'm filled with the spirit there isn't a doubt and that's what's the matter with me oh this is like heaven to me praise god this is like heaven to me i've crossed over jordan to cadence fireland and this is like heaven to me sing of course again oh this is like heaven to me oh this is like heaven to me i've crossed over jordan to cadence fairland and this is like heaven to me amen amen i thought we're supposed to be sitting in heavenly places sitting in heavenly places already by the baptism of the holy ghost which has taken us out of this and thank god thank god he has taken us out of this and set us up in a place where satan can't touch us he cannot do anything to a child of god without god allowing something for your good jesus said why in the world would a father if a child ask for a a fish would give him a serpent or ask for a bread my kids are hungry and give him a rock no he's going to give you the best bread he's given us the best bread right here he's give us the word of god and we must believe we got to start we're believers [Music] don't we do what believers do we believe that's what believers do believers believe unbelievers do what unbelief it's kind of simple sister it's alicia quick so can i give a quick testimonial um sure yeah come on y'all be seated you take that off there you go so you hear what you're saying hey guys it's been like a really hard journey for me and my family my mom's been like really sick on and off of copd and heart failure i feel like it's for like the past two years she's been sick like all of her life since we were young i should be in and out of the hospital but the lord blessed us with like um i guess like the past two years we've seen her have some really good days or some really good months seeing her looking really beautiful really strong really happy but then like this tragic thing kind of happened to her she fell down at home and she hit her head and her nurse wanted her to go to the hospital so she went ahead into the hospital um as days went to a week we thought she was going to get out like everything's going to be fine again we've seen her raise up many times but she's almost like she was in a coma-like state my mom was risen back up by the grace of the lord through prayer i've seen god raise her up so many times but this time was a little bit different i guess like with all of the um covet virus and everything we couldn't go visit her at all she ended up being moved from the regular hospital one day i talked to her on thursday night i can't see the dates right now i can't keep up with dates but i was like my mom was talking really well like mom about to go home she's like yeah i'm about to go back home so we're just all happy and everything should be getting out but the unexpected it took like a big turn instead of her going home it's like a few days later she was sent or the next day she was actually put into intensive care we still couldn't go see her because of the rules and it was like very very hard we couldn't go visit her first of all do i still trust you lord you know i trusted him through everything i can't say that a day without joy when i finally was able to see her but she wants to intensive care and then like days when i put like a tube thing in her neck like a catheter thing they put it through to her um so like check on her lungs and her heart like seal it where the fluids were collecting and her making what she couldn't breathe properly and when they did that i guess a couple days past she was still insisting here they're trying to help herself it was the most strongest oxygen they could possibly put on your nose like for the put that pressure through that still wasn't helping her lungs still kept collecting up the fluids and realized they couldn't help her anymore there was no more help from my mother from the medical field i mean it's just it was heartbreaking but i'm telling you i still was holding on to god that god you were real lord jesus i know what happened in brother branagh's prayer lines you know i've heard it all i believe it god if you want to raise her up you can raise her up but i guess like after all that happened we were contacting my mom's conscience about hospice we start pressuring her to go to hospitals they can't help her anymore and then also there's a double pressure if she didn't go to hospice we couldn't see her and we still didn't all get to see her only two people at a time were allowed to see my precious mother i'm telling y'all if that is something hard that is something hard the first time i had to hear was my husband i just had to i got a chance to pray with her to really this is my testimony i really had a chance to pray with her to read the bible it's hard to bring my bible like i actually gave her to my bible i gave her my bible temporarily i was like mommy gonna borrow this until you are healed in jesus name and you can come on back home because i was praying for a complete healing some moment she had many hardships i mean she really tried her best to raise that's what little she had she said my mother would sacrifice everything for us my dad was not really around as we became teenagers at all they were never married he was not really a moral support spiritual supporter anyway to my mother she went through a lot she went through a lot for us that really ain't gonna work for her as my mom she was a good mom to the best that she knew how to be that one change it you know the lord knows but as time went on she went she oh god y'all just don't even know mama was like you and chanda my mom calls me tc i go by tc to my whole family to my old church i used to go to but as i became a little bit older my kids got older i started going by elisha my middle name but actually my whole family calls me tc that's my nickname so i'm used to that but i just didn't come here with that i just kind of felt i don't know just knew and um she was like he's saying jenny y'all have to sign this hospice paper for me to go in we couldn't do it i could not do my sister my hand would not allow me to do it most of her hand actually cannot force her to sign these papers or they go to hospice so we both couldn't do it so i called leaving my mom she can't decide and me and my sister we cannot do it we will not sign the sausage paper after that my mom with a little bit stretchy has she signed the hospice paper herself so she can go ahead and say mama doesn't matter the hospice the hospital intensive care god can heal you mama in jesus name i still trusted him i mean he saved me a wretch like me there was nothing good in me i satisfied the truth nothing was good in me this is his grace i wanted to go through the complications of it it's only his grace and mercy he showed me his love and by his mercy and his tender mercy and grace i was able to hear able to hear what he was saying unto me to be able to be saved i knew it was the truth because it was the truth the truth the truth the full truth nothing was hidden how a woman should be to take off the makeup to wear a dress it wasn't a halfway truth i went to a halfway kind of church before me and him and i was like wow they could not move me nobody could change me if i want to dress how i want to dress i have to do it even even i loved him he could not change me i loved him full of love but it's like i got to do what i got to do but when i heard that real truth from the message about how ladyship is like man it's only the full truth it doesn't seem like there's a part way it's the whole the whole truth so i trusted with mama until the end by his grace and when i went to the hospital we finally got there i just i didn't realize that i was like well i was a hospice nurse i was like i still trust god from home i trust god you can raise her up i was so positive like so refreshing not anything good in me but then when i look back at it i wish i would have recognized the signs from my own heart to recognize the signs that god might take my mind home the man was trying to tell me it's a contract i was like i'm not hearing that i trust god god can raise my mother back up that was me i'm not gonna lie to y'all i was just like that god save me he can raise my mom up and give her a chance to have a happy life i want to see my mama home i want to say i have a husband that loved her i want his hair to serve the lord he's like well there's a beautiful woman she's a gorgeous woman gorgeous but she went through so many trials but i know god is controlling it but yet even in though it's like this i said look brother i know if god's ill is in control if he won't take her home he can take her home i'm still holding on i'm not gonna bury my mom they're gonna bury my mother i was like even when they show me paper signs i will show the doctor like is she on this side on the lasting my sister were there we were there to gather my brother together in the hospice alone on the last day of my mother's life it was so hard i only showed the doctor say i will not speak these words what level is she on hours to days or minutes where's my mom at at the last moment it's like where is she at they told me they were like she was like well maybe hours to days or not minutes so me and my sister went back to the room y'all i wanted to tell the full truth that all of y'all today are my eyewitness of this me and my sister where i'm witnesses to my mom's death to her passing on we're right there is nothing you want to behold there's nothing you want to be there for it's not that i want my children to be there i like lord take me quickly if you are taking me because we were in there we came in from the doctor they pulled us out of the room and my mom was by herself for a few minutes a few few precious minutes and i showed the doctor i said hours to minute hours to days i mean she was like well in the hours it could be hours today it's kind of in there me and channel back to the room we started talking about old brother who just passed two years ago many of you guys know if he was 35 years old his name was david extremely handsome tall like everything probably a girl with one very handsome but the lord chose to take him the lord chose to take him back in 2018. it was very difficult for my mom so me and chandler were actually in front of my mom was laying down me and chanda we're just talking about dave was like man what a shame man david is calling we wanted him to have everything he was like hourglass but i'm seeing her think mom has hours today but these are the last words we're saying so i'm just telling this truth i'm not gonna lie but just like that so i'm so sad i'm still saying so maybe you have not gotten over it because you weren't here for the funeral you know you didn't get to go to the funeral cause we're in the philippines at the time like maybe just not over it because i was like my sister's like yelling me don't you see the reality mama good time i'm good at the and i trust in the lord god's gonna raise my back up trust in him but he choose to take her home at peace but on the last day me and john were there i want this the most important part the most important part when we came to see her like two days before she died my mother said like god is the healer she is trusting god her life is in what god that's believe me i will tell you i'm just i drove my mama crazy about the lord i was like mama you gotta make it right have you made it right have you made it she's like baby baby you know this is a mama would you like man you keep asking me this stuff that's like mama have you made it right she said she has made it right so i know she's on the other side she's just waiting for us she's waiting for my sister to get right so i ask you guys to besiege you pray for chanda that is my younger sister chandan and her husband daniel that the holy ghost will just rapture them up the lord will speak through you and bring that word across it doesn't be anything but me if i'm praying in jesus name to get a hold of her she made a promise she's going to get saved my brother died at his funeral but she hasn't really walked but god said she's too busy her life is too difficult to try to give everything to god so as for that prayer but as we're they're talking about david my mom started coughing i went through every detail me and chanda ran to mama like mama mama and some different things happened i was like is this okay we started blessing for the nurse we looked outside like oh yo you nervous come and help us they never came it took them a long time then they finally came mama was gone she breathed her last breath and she was gone and my testimony on death because i'm not going through the graphic details it's so humbling do not think you are somebody that is my testimony do not think you got some money do not think i have a good job do not think you look good i think you have these things with this world when mama is gone mama is gone you hear me mama is gone y'all it's my testimony it doesn't matter how it comes across i'm telling the truth right now but i know she is on the other side i got to talk to my sister's like chanda don't you want to see mama again don't you want to see her again thank you jesus when mom was still breathing i said channel you want to see mama again david is over there you know we have my grandmother is over my grandma said i'm in baby i'm in just what she told me on the phone she is in with the lord so all of them are on the other side mom is just waiting on me and my sister so i just tell y'all she is in but death is the most humbling there's no dignity in death there's no pride in death there's no station in death that's not her breed that last breath and the different things that came to pass that are associated with death i was like wow god you are almighty god you are all i have you are everything to me you're my breath you're my every step you are my every thoughts you are what is keeping me someone encourage you young people even my own children not just other young people in the church that it's real we don't have anything we can't hold on to this stuff here we don't have anything the only thing we have is the lord so if anything i could say y'all just keep holding on keep holding on i'm telling you they've been moments boy i'm like i cannot wait to get to the other side the streets of gold are so real to me i can't wait to go but this world is so hard it's so hard to live here i'm just tired i cannot wait to go because i know everything that's wrong will be made right i can't wait to be where it's made right this is my testimony i love you guys i just want to share it with y'all like i had to share it which i was listening to liberty i'm at home i'm at church in the presence of saints it might be there for be like that for me elsewhere so i can just testify to y'all encourage y'all you know her that's not in vain she was 66 and the lure showed me something when i was there i thought mom was 65. i'm just being honest now i just know mama i'll say my mola is 65. and her little machine thing i seen 66 there i said mom you are a full bible that was before she was dead in my heart the lord gave me that little nugget in my heart my mama lived a full bible and so that blessed me and i know she's on the side looking beautiful healthy hair bouncing and everything you know just this way as it should be something that's not has many dreams for mommy y'all i like mommy you're looking so good i feel like well you just serve the lord god bless you with a good husband you know i just want to see her just be able to be happy you know they had a joy that i could have having a christian husband i want her to get a chance to have a taste of that that is a tiny taste of heaven when you are married to someone you really love you guys i would encourage each one of my kids and they don't want to get married right now you know how it is today but y'all when you have somebody you really love that stands by your side in the wrong and the right on your ugly side on your beautiful side of your nature and he's still standing by you praying for you and hold your hand baby calm down calm down when you're going through different things man i'm telling you it's an amazing thing it's a little tiny taste of the heaven i can't say it and compare it at all but thank god for him yeah he's nothing but a blessing to me he's never been a curse to me i just want to testify about that but you always want to encourage y'all don't give up amen the devil wants us to give up let's look at earthly things he wants to look at what we don't have what we should try to acquire see what we want to grab what we want to get he's not going to go with you right right can you breathe breath that breathe that last breath that is it is not common with you so just try to make it right yes you got anything hard on your heart try to make it right can i just love you guys i thank you for my church family thank you all for praying for me i really needed every single prayer and we still i still need the prayers now yeah we got many battles ahead so please pray for us i don't have to go through it but please pray for us i love you [Applause] it's a all but it's just a battle the war has already been won let's stand our feet we'll be dismissed just remember our sister and her family and uh pray the lord give us the right words to say while we're down there it's like dad always says he says you kind of have a captive audience at a funeral you don't have many people ever get up and leave while you're speaking so you can just hammer them away time to get right with god amen and that's true brothers and sisters you breathe your last breath on this side whatever you are when you breathe that last breath that's what you're going to be wherever you wind up at amen so we know as being a christian we're going to breathe our last one on this in this dimension but then when we start breathing over that other dimension it's it'll never be the same [Music] it'll be the most fresh we just don't know we just don't know we just don't know but but brother brown told us when he went across there he said do i have to go back to that yeah right do i have to go back to that so that's what we're looking forward to god bless you let's bow our heads just pray for the family this weekend i mean this week in the middle of the week lord be with uh i pray lord that you'll be with brother louise lord as he speaks wednesday lord be with each one here we pray lord that you would take what's been said lord and

your children lord sometimes we do it's like david we lay across our bed and we cry ourself to sleep lord are we we cry out to you lord but you're right there father this is all character building

and lord but we know that the war has already been won when you stepped out of that tomb and said all power and heaven there's been given unto me well guess where that power is now that power lays within the bride of jesus christ father to destroy death be with us and take care of the lord on the highways be with the ones that are sick lord the ones that are not here we'll come back together on
