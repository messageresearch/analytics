[3:06] want to see
[3:08] [Music]
[3:11] hey man that's what we're here to do
[3:14] let's go ahead and turn over in your
[3:17] scripture to Genesis chapter 24 and
[3:21] I did talk to brother Lewis earlier and
[3:23] he said he they'll be trying to stream
[3:25] in from Fort Lauderdale so they're
[3:27] taking a little pit stop on the way down
[3:30] one of those you know where you switch
[3:35] planes and all that stuff
[3:38] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[3:40] I
[3:45] was telling somebody you know you kind
[3:47] of look at all of the things that are
[3:49] happening these days and all the
[3:52] although you know all the people that
[3:54] have come out and the Hollywood and
[3:55] everything they have done all kinds of
[3:56] horrible things and it's getting in the
[3:58] news and it feels like manifesting time
[4:00] because the things that have been done
[4:02] in secret and now being made known
[4:04] everything all around and all walks of
[4:07] life the different groups of people are
[4:09] being kind of pulled together and and
[4:11] separated and it looks like people are
[4:15] being set aside and some grouped here
[4:17] and some group there and I know that
[4:20] sounds kind of like a little riddle but
[4:22] well that thing things are happening I
[4:25] believe and so
[4:28] too tonight I just maybe not not speak
[4:32] too long I don't I don't know how but
[4:34] long this will go but as the Lord leads
[4:37] I just want to take this little
[4:38] scripture from Genesis chapter 24 and
[4:40] the brothers in the back if you just
[4:42] kind of keep Genesis chapter 24 we're
[4:45] gonna just kind of read through that
[4:46] whole chapter and and look at some
[4:49] things here tonight so let's just cover
[4:51] the Lord in prayer
[4:53] Lord Jesus we're just so thankful to be
[4:56] able to gather together around your word
[4:57] Lord Jesus and to be able to look into
[4:59] the promises that you made that you
[5:01] prepared for us before the foundation of
[5:03] the world and I pray Lord that you'll
[5:05] just open up these mysteries to us
[5:08] tonight Lord Jesus help us Lord to be
[5:10] able to see more of what our part is and
[5:11] who we are Lord that you'll open the
[5:14] eyes of our heart Lord Jesus to see you
[5:16] as song we sing Lord I saw all of our
[5:18] prayer tonight or DS Asst Lord as we
[5:21] look into the word Lord what service
[5:23] would it be Lord if you weren't here
[5:25] Lord and so Lord we just invite you to
[5:28] come and make your abode with us tonight
[5:29] we open the door of our hearts Lord the
[5:32] door of the church Lord that you'll feel
[5:35] welcome and be able to come in and set
[5:36] among us oh Jesus Lord and granted I
[5:39] pray Lord that you'll just make this
[5:41] word come alive to us that it won't be
[5:43] in vain as we gather here tonight Lord
[5:45] but Lord Jesus that you'll help us Lord
[5:48] Jesus to know you more we ask these
[5:51] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:53] Christ amen
[5:55] I'm just gonna take my coat off and
[5:58] you're supposed to ask permission right
[6:01] is it all right if I take my coat
[6:09] not too much reading tonight
[6:12] Genesis chapter 24 verse 62 to 63 and
[6:16] Isaac came from the way of the well
[6:18] Lahaie La Hire OE for he dwelt in the
[6:21] South Country and Isaac went out to
[6:24] meditate in the field of the Eventide
[6:25] and he lifted up his eyes and saw and
[6:28] behold the camels were coming you may be
[6:32] seated
[6:34] so I you know with all of the different
[6:38] things that are kind of happening today
[6:40] and you know you many times ministers
[6:43] will say things look bleak and and so
[6:45] forth and you know out west a a lot of
[6:48] the people that I work with I work with
[6:49] a couple of people in their way at work
[6:51] in California and they talked about the
[6:53] wildfires that are near near the office
[6:56] that we have out there and and then you
[6:58] see things that people are posting
[7:00] online about the different fires around
[7:02] Los Angeles and somebody said that it
[7:05] looks like like hail had arisen and and
[7:09] you know the pictures that people are
[7:11] posting it it does look very hellish
[7:13] different earthquakes all around the
[7:15] world and things that are taking place
[7:17] but you know I believe that the reason a
[7:20] lot of these things are taking places is
[7:22] it's not just
[7:24] that there's a cause for it and and
[7:26] what's happening is that God is is
[7:29] preparing his bride and it is bride is
[7:31] coming together and it's the bride is
[7:34] maturing
[7:36] and realize who she is and and and it's
[7:39] kind of is something secret is taking
[7:41] place you know you you even you know to
[7:45] be honest and many of the ranks and the
[7:47] message I think many people fail to
[7:48] really see what's happening and and so I
[7:52] want to take maybe for a little topic
[7:54] tonight here comes the bride
[7:57] because you know that this little story
[8:00] that we're looking at Isaac looked out
[8:01] across the field at Eventide at the
[8:03] evening time and he looked out across
[8:05] the field and he saw the camels were
[8:07] coming when the camels were carrying his
[8:10] bride and you know you can look at all
[8:13] of these different things and they
[8:14] signify that something is taking place
[8:16] and I believe the bride is coming and
[8:19] maybe they're not I don't want to speak
[8:21] maybe in the future tense I think we've
[8:23] we've talked in the future tense for so
[8:25] long but now the hour is that the bride
[8:29] that is has come
[8:31] it's a present tense theme the bride is
[8:34] is where she needs to be I believe she's
[8:37] recognizing her position she's
[8:39] recognizing who she is and that's really
[8:42] one of the things I want to convey
[8:43] tonight is who do we say the bride is
[8:46] and I think you know sometimes you know
[8:49] you get up behind the pulpit and many
[8:51] times the things kind of like what I
[8:54] might talk about tonight or is something
[8:56] you almost feel pressure not to just
[8:58] straight up say things because it's it's
[9:02] it's hard to believe who the bride he is
[9:05] who the bride really is and and so maybe
[9:10] I just want to kind of lay it out there
[9:11] tonight yet the Lord will help me but
[9:14] you know think about that song that they
[9:16] sing at weddings and everything here
[9:18] comes the bride here comes the bride and
[9:21] the bride comes marching down the aisle
[9:23] and maybe just think about that that
[9:27] the the situation that's set up there
[9:31] all the different things that are done
[9:34] in a wedding and and are prepared in a
[9:37] certain way that that really they speak
[9:39] to something that a traditional wedding
[9:42] now I'm not speaking of like one of
[9:43] these modern weddings where everything
[9:45] is going haywire but in a real true
[9:49] traditional wedding where the bride
[9:51] comes down dressed in white why does she
[9:55] dressed in white and you know somebody
[9:57] has told her out how to walk and
[9:59] instructed her the white right way to
[10:02] present herself and and and how all of
[10:04] those things should be done and she
[10:06] comes down and she's got the veil over
[10:09] her face and then she comes up and she's
[10:11] presented to the groom and he you know
[10:14] you look at a lot of weddings and as the
[10:16] bride's walking down the aisle the groom
[10:17] might be thinking to himself well you
[10:19] know I'm not so sure I should be doing
[10:22] this and maybe he's having second
[10:23] thoughts and all of those things but in
[10:25] a real prepared situation where the
[10:28] groom has prayed about it and he's put
[10:30] thought into it when he when he sees his
[10:32] bride coming down the aisle he sees the
[10:35] one that that is gonna make him complete
[10:38] that she matches him she is
[10:41] going back to the to the original groom
[10:45] and bride and the and the Garden of Eden
[10:49] they she was born of his bone and flesh
[10:53] of his flesh he was a perfect match so
[10:56] when when a groom a real somebody that's
[10:58] really prayed and and and and it has
[11:01] been seeking a bride when he sees her
[11:02] coming down the aisle it's a very happy
[11:06] time and she's turned over to him and
[11:08] she she's got that veil over her face
[11:10] which signifies something she lifts it
[11:14] and and they go through the all the
[11:15] ceremony and entered in and and join
[11:18] them in the in the Bible way and say all
[11:21] the different things and then you know
[11:23] they turn and they present the bride the
[11:26] minister does presents the bride and the
[11:28] groom to the people and you know the
[11:30] traditional way a lot that all these
[11:32] modern things out they'll say differ
[11:34] both other names and all that kind of
[11:36] stuff but their traditional way is to
[11:38] present them mr. and mrs. and the name
[11:41] of that groom and not in two different
[11:44] names but they now they've got that same
[11:47] name and you know the the name the name
[11:51] represents it represents the
[11:53] characteristics it identifies who that
[11:55] person he is the name is what that
[11:58] person is all about you know we talked
[12:01] about in the Garden of Eden and when the
[12:03] Spirit of the Lord came upon Adam and he
[12:05] began to name all the different animals
[12:07] and those things he was naming them
[12:09] based on the spirit of god was
[12:11] quickening in him to give them a name
[12:12] based on what their characteristics were
[12:14] he gave that lamb the name of the of a
[12:17] lamb because it had a characteristic it
[12:20] was what what his nature was it produced
[12:22] wool and it was very meek and all of
[12:25] those different things and all the
[12:27] different animals that you could go
[12:28] through they had a characteristic about
[12:31] them and so that name that was put on
[12:34] them to show what it was and so on a
[12:37] groom when a bride and a groom are
[12:39] joined together she takes on his name
[12:41] because now she's got the same
[12:43] characteristics as him we're kind of
[12:46] mixing the natural the spiritual a
[12:47] little bit I know because a lot of times
[12:49] in the natural the the bride doesn't
[12:51] really have that any anything close to
[12:54] the same characteristics as as the
[12:56] husband a lot of times they're not
[12:57] really quite United and everything they
[13:00] have problems and everything but we're
[13:01] talking to spiritual and you know when
[13:04] when Isaac wanted a wife she was she was
[13:08] off down and in the land of mesopotamia
[13:11] often the Fertile Crescent worshiping
[13:13] idols and everything and so he he sent a
[13:16] messenger Abraham did to go get her out
[13:20] of that condition and though she was all
[13:22] her life was you know and kind of and
[13:24] not and not in a state where it would be
[13:26] suitable for her to marry such a man
[13:28] that had been had been raised up in a
[13:31] god-fearing household and everything but
[13:32] yet yet she was brought from that
[13:34] condition into a place where she could
[13:37] be presented to him and she would be
[13:39] worthy and I think that's where God what
[13:41] God is doing for us in this out what
[13:44] he's been doing for the last 40 50
[13:46] however many years and so many of our
[13:48] lives he's brought us from the land of
[13:51] Egypt brought us through the wilderness
[13:53] through the valley of the sin all of
[13:56] those different things until now we're
[13:58] entering into the Promised Land
[14:01] so let's read a little bit from Genesis
[14:05] chapter 24
[14:13] try not to start leaking here
[14:17] let's start at verse one if y'all want
[14:20] to pull that up Genesis chapter 24 verse
[14:23] 1
[14:24] and we just kind of want to just take
[14:26] our time and just meditate on some of
[14:28] the things in this in this little
[14:29] chapter because we've got we've kind of
[14:32] got a scene that you know these are
[14:35] types and it's it's very hard for a type
[14:38] is not the thing so it's hard for you to
[14:40] see all of the things that make up the
[14:43] thing in the title if that makes sense
[14:46] there's a lot of things going on for
[14:49] example you could not fully see all of
[14:50] the different attributes that make up
[14:51] Malachi 4 or 5 6 in in Eleazar but you
[14:55] know it takes a lot of different types
[14:57] and things in the Old Testament to kind
[14:58] of put together that picture where you
[15:00] can see that of what what kind of nature
[15:03] what kind of person this this hour
[15:06] Eleazar would be well you've got the
[15:09] stories and an ester with it mimicking
[15:12] the Sabbath and all the de chambers and
[15:14] all the different things you've got this
[15:16] different stories of Elijah and Elijah
[15:18] and all those so it all comes together
[15:20] to create a great big tapestry of what
[15:22] God is doing
[15:24] and Abraham was old and well streaking
[15:27] an agent and the Lord had blessed
[15:28] Abraham and all things and Abraham said
[15:31] unto his eldest servant of his house
[15:33] that rule over all that he had put I
[15:35] pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I
[15:38] will make thee swear by the Lord the God
[15:39] of heaven and the god of the earth that
[15:41] thou shalt not take a wife unto my son
[15:43] of the daughters of the Canaanites among
[15:46] whom I dwell
[15:48] you know I think that's a good lesson
[15:50] for us all all of us you know we teach
[15:52] our children that you want to find a
[15:54] good because of what I just said you
[15:56] want to find somebody that's a match for
[15:58] you and you don't you don't want to find
[16:02] somebody that's gonna give you a lot of
[16:03] grief and everything so we want the very
[16:05] best for our children and so but you
[16:07] know I we were listening on the way to
[16:09] church tonight we were listening to the
[16:10] choosing of a bride and I I think a lot
[16:12] of times in our kind of devotional we
[16:14] kind of stop it at that and make the
[16:17] choosing of a bride all these deep deep
[16:19] kind of sermons that brother Branham
[16:20] talked about just a little life lesson
[16:23] but what brother Branham was really
[16:25] speaking of was so much deeper than just
[16:27] just a little good a good little lesson
[16:29] to help you run your house and
[16:30] everything he's speaking of of what of
[16:33] who we are
[16:35] and I will make thee swear by the Lord
[16:38] the God of heaven and the god of the
[16:39] earth that thou shalt not take a wife
[16:41] under my son of the daughters of the
[16:42] Canaanites among whom I Boyle but thou
[16:44] shalt go into my country and to my
[16:46] kindred and take a wife under my son
[16:48] Isaac and we know that this is speaking
[16:51] of he had to find somebody that was
[16:53] kinship to him somebody that was related
[16:56] to you know and the only way that we
[16:58] could be related to him is he puts his
[16:59] own life inside of us right and so
[17:02] that's one of the things where I can I
[17:04] was speaking of earlier that it's
[17:05] difficult to take a type and apply it
[17:08] perfectly because it doesn't it is a
[17:11] little bit fuzzy there if you're just
[17:13] gonna look at the type exactly but he
[17:15] he's gay he wants to find a good
[17:17] relation and and so he makes us related
[17:21] to him not by your natural birth not by
[17:23] the way you came into the world from
[17:24] your mama and daddy but through a
[17:26] spiritual birth by putting by you
[17:28] receiving his word and and he comes in
[17:30] quickens his word and makes it alive in
[17:33] you I
[17:34] know that's kind of a little rehash of
[17:38] some things but you know it's good to
[17:40] rehash sometimes and the service said
[17:44] unto Him peradventure the woman will not
[17:45] be willing to follow me under this land
[17:47] must I knees bring thy son again under
[17:49] the land from whence thou camest and
[17:51] Abraham said unto Him beware that I
[17:53] bring not my son thither again the Lord
[17:56] God of heaven which took me from my
[17:58] father's house and from the land of my
[18:00] kindred and which spake unto me and I
[18:02] swear unto me saying under thy seed will
[18:04] I give this land he shall send His angel
[18:06] before thee and thou shalt take a wife
[18:09] under my son from thence so here we've
[18:13] got Isaac the promised son the one that
[18:15] had God had promised Abraham when he
[18:17] said I don't have anybody to take my
[18:20] inheritance I don't have anybody to
[18:22] leave all the things that you've
[18:24] promised to him there wouldn't that be
[18:26] an interesting predicament for for God
[18:28] to leave Abraham in where he had given
[18:30] him all of the land and all of those
[18:32] different things and all that made all
[18:33] those promises to him and then when
[18:35] Abraham died know what nobody to have it
[18:38] so of course he made that promise to
[18:40] Abraham that he wouldn't just give it to
[18:42] Eliezer the servant but he would he
[18:44] would his inheritance will be given the
[18:47] one that would come from his loins so
[18:49] how from his loins came Isaac and and
[18:52] one day we know with all of the
[18:53] different stories Isaac was he went
[18:55] through the the kind of the same types
[18:58] that that Jesus went through how he was
[19:00] offered up as a lamb on the on the
[19:03] sacrifice and that story of Jehovah
[19:06] Jireh that God will provide himself a
[19:08] sacrifice and and so Abraham turning to
[19:11] saw the sacrifice there and they were
[19:13] able to offer it up but you know Isaac
[19:14] went up to that altar willingly and laid
[19:17] his life down a willing sacrifice
[19:20] and so it's just a perfect type of
[19:24] Christ about how Christ gave himself on
[19:26] the cross and laid himself down so that
[19:29] so that really so that you could come
[19:31] forth because if he had not died done
[19:34] that then then this great mystery that's
[19:36] been hidden from ages and ages can never
[19:39] have come to be so as as Jesus was dying
[19:42] on the cross giving his life you know
[19:44] you think about when somebody if
[19:45] somebody were to pay for something
[19:47] somebody to give you a quarter for a
[19:49] loaf of bread or whatever then then
[19:51] they're given that quarter but they're
[19:53] giving it for something that that thing
[19:56] that they're buying has value and that
[19:59] thing you think about Jesus's blood
[20:01] dripping off of the cross that that
[20:03] blood was paying the price for something
[20:06] what was it paying for it was paying it
[20:07] for you
[20:08] you know sometimes I think the devil
[20:11] tries to get us all down and out and
[20:13] because it he makes you think that
[20:14] because you're going through trials and
[20:16] troubles and everything that you're
[20:17] you're not a good Christian that you're
[20:19] no longer worthy of these things but God
[20:22] paid the price he paid it with his own
[20:24] blood and he paid it because he knew
[20:26] that you had value to him you were you
[20:28] had you were more valuable to him than
[20:31] his blood was and that's that's kind of
[20:35] a big statement to him you were more but
[20:39] you had more value to him than his blood
[20:40] otherwise he wasn't he giving it away he
[20:43] gave it away on the cross and watched it
[20:44] drip down and so they took him in and
[20:47] they and they took his body and they
[20:49] laid him in the grave and they and you
[20:51] know they sealed it up and we you make
[20:52] all the all the stories about how the
[20:54] Roman dog might sealed it up and they
[20:56] they sealed up that grave so that nobody
[20:59] knew whether he was in there not and all
[21:01] those different things and the disciples
[21:03] were running around afraid and then and
[21:05] then that life came into that body and
[21:08] busted out of that out of that tomb so
[21:11] that to prove that that he was he was
[21:14] resurrected and they looked inside and
[21:15] they they searched and they couldn't
[21:17] find his body and when you know all the
[21:19] stories about how Mary came and looking
[21:20] for it and she thought she found the
[21:22] somebody that she thought was a gardener
[21:25] and and along and along
[21:27] make a long story short a very long
[21:29] story short he he went away and as he
[21:33] was going away he has sent it into a
[21:35] cloud the Bible says and he says in the
[21:37] same way that you see me going and this
[21:39] manner that you'll see me coming back
[21:41] and so you know this kind of sets
[21:43] everything up in the same way that this
[21:45] story of Isaac was set up because Isaac
[21:47] was not where his bride was he was away
[21:50] he had to leave the earth you know you
[21:53] know God kind of sets up everything in
[21:55] this way for a reason so that in each
[21:58] tip sensation there's another group on
[22:01] the earth and I believe he does that so
[22:04] there so we're not gonna get confused
[22:05] about what's happening as each thing
[22:08] takes place God Jesus Christ leaves the
[22:11] earth so now what's happening now what's
[22:15] happening his life comes back and lives
[22:17] inside of the believers and now is his
[22:19] bride on the earth and then you know you
[22:23] keep going down to the different
[22:24] dispensations Elijah comes on the earth
[22:26] God is speaking the voice of God in this
[22:29] man Elijah and he's speaking but then
[22:31] Elijah goes off the earth and you see
[22:34] different things taking place because
[22:36] you know that that the last time for the
[22:38] Lewis priest he read that that quote
[22:41] about how brother Brennan was said in
[22:42] the voice of the sign it was the the
[22:44] last of the four messages of the horses
[22:45] a sign during the prayer line brother
[22:47] Anna speaks that there's got to be
[22:49] somebody on earth to be the voice of God
[22:51] all the time there's got to be somebody
[22:53] on earth
[22:54] and you know I think sometimes I can be
[22:57] a little bit confusing what what is the
[22:59] voice of God you know program said the
[23:01] voice of God is is word if and so if
[23:05] it's not necessarily a particular person
[23:07] that has the voice of God we needed a
[23:10] person to come and give us the voice of
[23:12] God but once you hear that voice of God
[23:14] and you receive it and then that word
[23:16] becomes
[23:17] mature in you and you're saying the
[23:20] exact same thing exact same thing to
[23:22] that that that prophet said the exact
[23:24] same thing that all the prophets before
[23:26] him said and it meshes completely in the
[23:28] Bible and you can run it all the way
[23:30] through then you to have the voice of
[23:32] God it doesn't matter if you're a little
[23:34] a little washerwoman a little somebody
[23:36] out on the street that barely knows
[23:37] their ABCs you know you could you can be
[23:40] helped so much by a little washer woman
[23:43] sitting on her on her front porch in a
[23:45] rocking chair and you go up to here and
[23:47] sometimes she more know about God she'll
[23:48] know more about God and then a lot of
[23:50] people that are behind the pulpit
[23:52] because it doesn't matter necessarily
[23:54] what the you know a donkey could be the
[23:59] voice of God could be in a donkey as it
[24:00] was the Balaam it doesn't matter
[24:02] necessarily the vessel but what matters
[24:05] is the word and I believe that that were
[24:08] serving a god that that he's behind his
[24:11] word you know no man's
[24:14] the the voice of any man is gonna be
[24:16] their word so God is backing his word if
[24:20] he said it he's going to make it come to
[24:23] pass
[24:24] you know that that really kind of struck
[24:27] me the other day I was kind of
[24:28] meditating on that and and you know that
[24:31] God had got us framed the world by his
[24:34] word he spoke the word and the worlds
[24:38] were framed into existence and not just
[24:40] this world but all the universe and all
[24:42] the things you look up into the night
[24:43] sky and see all the different stars
[24:45] twinkling and everything and then all
[24:47] from that great vastness and then come
[24:49] right down to your fingernail and all
[24:52] the little things that make up your body
[24:53] and all those different things he he
[24:55] framed all of that by his word and so
[24:58] we're we're not serving a God where it's
[25:01] just a theological concept and
[25:02] everything but it's it's a God where
[25:04] there's actually power behind these
[25:06] words to change your life to change the
[25:09] power of transformation to take a sinner
[25:12] and turn them into a saint to take
[25:13] somebody that doesn't know anything
[25:14] about God and take turn them into a
[25:17] mature Christian to take you to take a
[25:19] hold of somebody that's called up in the
[25:22] world and and bound by alcohol and drugs
[25:24] and yeah who knows what else and
[25:26] transform them into it somebody's where
[25:28] God is tabernacled inside of them and so
[25:32] that's what I mean by when I say that
[25:34] here comes the bride because he's done
[25:37] that he's doing that now he's doing that
[25:39] for us all of us sitting here he's
[25:42] taking us and molded us and and and put
[25:45] us on the back of these camels and
[25:46] moving us down through history truth
[25:48] through time until we've come to a place
[25:50] where what we're waiting on next is the
[25:54] body change
[25:56] so if we just keep reading through this
[25:58] little chapter we get to a place where
[26:01] we're where this little special man was
[26:03] sent for this to get this bride for
[26:06] Isaac to get her and and take her back
[26:08] to him and you know I think it's it's
[26:12] moving us to kind of dwell on this for
[26:14] just a little bit and just this chapter
[26:17] 24 13 through 14 says
[26:19] [Music]
[26:23] that where I am
[26:31] yeah I'm just gonna skip down there
[26:33] because what what Isaac does is or what
[26:36] Abraham does is he sends a man after
[26:38] Isaac a type of what's happening in this
[26:41] day where after all of the seven church
[26:43] ages has passed and God sends a man to
[26:45] to man down to us to get the bride ready
[26:49] to polish everything up now now I'm
[26:52] gonna take a little liberties here and
[26:54] also type Eliezer is not just brother
[26:56] branham in this last day but also all of
[26:58] the all of the ones that have gone all
[27:01] down through the seven churches Paul and
[27:03] Irina's and Martin Colombo Luther all
[27:04] the ones that have been sent to get a
[27:07] bride ready in their day also because
[27:10] you know I think sometimes we we kind of
[27:12] get a little mistaken idea that the
[27:14] bride's only couldn't come out of this
[27:16] last day the bride's got to come out of
[27:18] the the wheat plant comes out of all the
[27:20] different ages you can't forget about
[27:21] the other ones you can't forget about
[27:23] all you can't forget about the feet and
[27:25] the leg and the knees and all the ones
[27:27] that all the other body parts because
[27:29] what what body what kind of body would
[27:31] it be if it only had a head but it's got
[27:34] to have the whole thing and they without
[27:36] us could not be made perfect it's all of
[27:39] it comes together into a great big
[27:41] tapestry and so
[27:43] there is a Eliezer he came to the well
[27:46] and he's asking the Lord Lord God of
[27:49] Israel to help him find the right one to
[27:53] lead him and guide him to get the right
[27:55] one and that she'll respond well and
[27:57] that the right one will that heal the
[28:01] right one will be identified and so he
[28:04] says behold I stand here by the will of
[28:05] water and verse 13 and
[28:08] the daughters of the men of the city
[28:10] come out to draw water and let it come
[28:12] to pass that the damsel to whom I shall
[28:14] say let down that picture I pray thee
[28:17] that I may drink and she shall say drink
[28:19] and I will give thy camels drink also
[28:21] let the same be she that thou hast
[28:24] appointed before thy servant Isaac and
[28:25] thereby shall I know that thou has
[28:28] showed kindness unto my master and you
[28:31] know so so there he's laying it out
[28:33] before God that this little pattern and
[28:35] the pattern is that he's gonna say
[28:37] something and she's gonna respond and I
[28:39] like that because you see that's what's
[28:41] happening today on the tapes the voice
[28:44] of God says something and you should
[28:45] respond you gotta say something to as a
[28:49] minister behind the Pope is saying
[28:50] something and you got to respond you got
[28:52] to make a choice you can either have to
[28:53] say I believe that that's right or well
[28:55] I don't know but I'll go back and look
[28:57] at it some more I'll go study a little
[28:58] bit deeper or you just outright reject
[29:01] it which is not what we want to do if
[29:03] it's the true Word of God and so
[29:07] you know this the same little pattern
[29:09] has as repeated and lots of other little
[29:12] stories through Scripture and you know I
[29:15] think one of these little things that
[29:16] God is showing to us now is that is that
[29:19] these little women that the Bible talks
[29:22] about
[29:23] Rahab and
[29:25] the widow woman that Elijah went to and
[29:28] the Shunammite woman and the woman at
[29:29] the well the reason all these little
[29:31] special women were put in there is
[29:32] because there are types of the bride
[29:34] responding to this to this gospel call
[29:37] the gospel call is calling him out and
[29:39] they they respond and so that a special
[29:41] person is sent to each of these little
[29:43] ladies and they respond and in the way
[29:46] that the each of them do and they're
[29:47] different stories so Eliezer we talked
[29:50] about earlier that Eliezer was he he
[29:52] originally was gonna be the inheritor of
[29:56] all of the things all of the property
[29:58] but so you know that kind of makes him a
[30:01] very special person because he could
[30:03] have he could have inherited everything
[30:05] just by himself but he laid down his
[30:07] life really he gave his whole life over
[30:10] so that so that Isaac could have a bride
[30:14] you know I think that's one thing that
[30:17] kind of befuddles us today so many of us
[30:20] says we think that everything is all
[30:22] wrapped up in our Eliezer that Eliezer
[30:25] inherits everything our eyes are so
[30:28] stuck on Eliezer that we can't see past
[30:30] eleazar
[30:31] eleazar doesn't get everything now he
[30:34] gets everything as far as you know being
[30:36] part of the bride and joint-heirs with
[30:37] Christ and all that kind of thing he's
[30:39] part of the plan that's not what I mean
[30:41] but but we we need to go a little step
[30:45] beyond that and look at see what Eliezer
[30:48] came for he came to bring a message to
[30:50] catch a bride the bride is the is the
[30:53] purpose of what his message was about
[30:55] and so in this little story of Eliezer
[30:59] he was on a divine mission God sent an
[31:01] angel ahead of him he had an angel with
[31:04] him and he had supreme confidence from
[31:07] his master that he was going to do the
[31:09] right thing that he would follow the
[31:10] leading of the Lord to get a bride for
[31:13] Isaac that that he would bring a wife
[31:16] back to Abraham's inheritance and so
[31:18] Abraham was had confidence in him that
[31:21] he would play his role and that God
[31:24] would move upon the scene to have a wife
[31:26] answer back a young little lady that had
[31:29] been set apart
[31:34] so let's keep reading just this 24
[31:38] 1517 I
[31:40] clocked moving faster than I thought it
[31:42] would and
[31:47] it came to pass before he had done
[31:50] speaking that behold Rebekah came out
[31:53] who was born to bethe UL son of Milcah
[31:55] the wife of Nahor Abraham's brother with
[31:58] her picture upon her shoulder you know I
[32:00] think that's interesting that this
[32:01] little story takes place at a well and
[32:03] it ends at a will because Isaac was
[32:07] coming by the will of a high high high
[32:09] ROI and he was coming through from that
[32:12] well and you know this kind of parallels
[32:14] another little story that we've heard
[32:16] about where there was another woman at
[32:18] the well and she was she was coming at
[32:20] to the well because I well was a
[32:22] gathering place where they come to get
[32:24] something to drink and she Jesus it
[32:26] ended up with her saying I want
[32:27] something I want some of this water that
[32:30] you're talking about that you're
[32:31] drinking of and so in this story Eliezer
[32:34] met this woman at this well because he
[32:37] was offering her something as well he
[32:40] was offering her to be part of Isaac's
[32:43] life
[32:44] it is so amazing how God does those
[32:47] types of little things he sets
[32:49] everything up so that you see these
[32:51] little interesting things being played
[32:52] out
[32:54] and the damsel was very fair to look
[32:56] upon a virgin neither had any man known
[32:58] her and she went down to the well and
[33:00] filled her pitcher and came up and the
[33:03] servant ran to meet her and said let me
[33:05] I pray thee drink a little water of thy
[33:08] pitcher
[33:10] and she said drink my lord
[33:13] and she hasted and let down her pitcher
[33:14] upon her hand and gave him drink and
[33:18] when she had done giving him drinks she
[33:20] said I would draw water for thy camels
[33:22] also until they have done drinking and
[33:26] so she's doing the same thing that this
[33:27] little widow of Zarephath did when
[33:29] Elijah said first give me first give me
[33:32] something to eat she's offering a
[33:35] making an offering our first first
[33:37] herself she's putting others before
[33:45] so you can see all of these little types
[33:48] being played out where she responds in
[33:50] the in the correct way and so you know
[33:52] what what Eliezer is really doing is
[33:54] he's he's making that Gospel call to get
[33:58] her dressed up right so that he can
[34:00] present her to Isaac so that he can show
[34:03] her and and get her prepared what he's
[34:06] really doing is he's offering her an
[34:08] invitation to worship because you know
[34:10] you see that in God's provided place of
[34:13] worship brother Branham laid out all of
[34:14] the different places all of the
[34:16] different patterns of getting some money
[34:18] to worship and he ends up with where is
[34:21] it where is God has provided place of
[34:23] worship God has provided place of
[34:24] worship is in Christ and if you can get
[34:26] in Christ he's the door he's the way you
[34:29] could get into him and you have the
[34:30] right way of worship and get into his
[34:32] word but really
[34:34] summing it all up the all these
[34:37] different types and things that that God
[34:39] laid out in the Old Testament of the the
[34:41] blood over the little of the door and
[34:43] that in in Egypt and the the tabernacle
[34:48] that they built in the wilderness all of
[34:49] those were think speaking of God in
[34:52] dwelling inside of you that's what God
[34:56] wants to do he wants to dwell inside of
[34:59] the people get himself inside of you so
[35:01] that he can be Lord of you get himself
[35:03] so that he's tabernacling himself inside
[35:06] of you and then you're worshiping God in
[35:08] the right way you don't know how to
[35:10] worship without God inside of you to
[35:12] guide you to we need a guide like that
[35:14] story that brother I'm told about how
[35:16] when he got lost in the wilderness and
[35:18] he he needed a guide because he thought
[35:20] he knew the way home he thought he knew
[35:21] how to get back and he reached his hand
[35:23] up and said Lord I
[35:25] need you to put my hand on the guide
[35:27] without that guide you don't even know
[35:30] how right with the right approaches
[35:32] while you'll think that you're saved by
[35:34] the things that you do by the things
[35:36] that that you just because you go to
[35:38] church because you do different things
[35:40] but you're what you're what you do is
[35:42] you're saved by the word that you've
[35:45] you've held that you you receive the
[35:47] word and you eat it and you hang on to
[35:48] it
[35:52] so what what God's great mystery that
[35:55] was well sealed up when Jesus was down
[35:57] in that grave was sealed up that God was
[36:00] trying to has been hidden God's great
[36:02] mystery is that God has a bride and his
[36:05] bride has to be revealed so he he
[36:08] Abraham sent that little that little
[36:11] we'll call it a type of a prophet
[36:13] Eliezer down to get a bride for Isaac to
[36:16] as a type of God calling us calling us
[36:20] to worship to a true worshiper his
[36:24] provided place of worship so that we are
[36:27] dwelling with him in communion and in
[36:29] the experience of the new birth
[36:33] so let's keep on reading and I'm Iver
[36:37] honestly I'm not I'm not gonna take up
[36:39] too much much more time and let's see
[36:42] Genesis 24 55 to 59
[36:45] I'm just gonna kind of skip down a
[36:48] little bit and just kind of read cuz you
[36:50] know you either Eliezer went and he
[36:52] began to speak to to Rebecca's family
[36:55] and begin to talk to them about how God
[36:58] had Abraham had sent him and all of the
[37:01] different things that had happened how
[37:02] he laid it before the Lord how he wanted
[37:04] to her to you know offer to water his
[37:09] camels and all those different things
[37:10] and so they you know her dad and her her
[37:14] granddad they said well this is this is
[37:17] definitely a leading of the Lord and so
[37:19] they began to have this conversation at
[37:21] Genesis 24 15 chapter verse 55 and her
[37:26] brother and her mother said let the
[37:27] damsel abide with us a few days and at
[37:30] the least 10 after that she shall go and
[37:33] he said unto them hinder me not seeing
[37:35] the Lord hath prospered my way he send
[37:37] me away that I may go to my master hey
[37:40] you know
[37:42] so many of us in our in our journeys
[37:44] we've been hindered by things that
[37:46] others have said to us you know brother
[37:48] Brown talked about how we need to get
[37:50] our flus unstopped and our flus run stop
[37:52] because of life and because of sin and
[37:55] all those different things somebody's
[37:56] told you something somebody's told you
[37:58] you can't be saved somebody's told you
[38:00] you you're not going to go in the
[38:02] rapture because your birth and all those
[38:03] different things and here we've got
[38:05] brother Branham explained that her
[38:07] brother had kind of types her you know
[38:10] you know maybe a preacher and her mother
[38:12] types that denominational system that
[38:14] came out of and all those different kind
[38:16] of things just kind of bind us up
[38:18] together you know you can get bound up
[38:20] by different preachers and you know
[38:22] today you you look around and people
[38:23] people have been so bound up by
[38:25] preachers that are not preaching to any
[38:27] kind of word or preaching false doctrine
[38:29] that now many people have completely
[38:32] lost all confidence in preachers but you
[38:34] know like Elijah when he wondered if
[38:37] there was even at 7,000 that was still
[38:38] serving the Lord there still if there's
[38:41] if there's false preachers there's still
[38:43] true preachers and and you know that
[38:45] really the difference between a false
[38:46] and the true is a false we'll try to
[38:48] keep that veil on your eyes and I
[38:51] believe a true preacher will try to lift
[38:53] the veil because it's not that preacher
[38:55] is God in the preacher lift lifting the
[38:58] veil over to cause you to realize who
[39:00] you who you are and to realize that
[39:02] God's Word is true and that God can save
[39:04] you and justify you and sanctify you and
[39:06] keep you sanctified and keep you saved
[39:08] that there's power in the gospel that
[39:11] he's able to do it but you know the
[39:14] false preached the false doctrine will
[39:16] bind you and make you think that there's
[39:19] nothing real going on and all those kind
[39:21] of things and so so she came out of this
[39:24] this system where where she heard maybe
[39:27] maybe her brother a false doctrine she
[39:29] heard her mother saying don't go with
[39:32] them let's just kind of stay back stay
[39:34] back in this system but yet she made a
[39:36] decision contrary to all the stuff that
[39:38] she was here and there and accepted the
[39:40] word of the Lord through this little
[39:42] Eliezer and he said unto them hinder me
[39:44] not seeing the Lord hath prospered my
[39:46] ways send me away that I may go to my
[39:48] master and they said we will call a
[39:50] damsel and inquire at her mouth
[39:53] now that's kind of striking because she
[39:56] gotta say something she's got a speech
[39:59] she's got to say I am gonna go and
[40:03] that's the way that your whole your
[40:05] whole Christian experience is based upon
[40:07] your confession right he's the high
[40:09] priest of our confession you've got to
[40:11] speak it and you know it's not alright
[40:14] just for you to you know didn't Jesus
[40:17] say if you if if you testify me in front
[40:20] of others and I know I'm a little
[40:21] paraphrasing a little bit because I
[40:23] frankly I can't require remember exactly
[40:25] but
[40:26] then I won't if you're not ashamed of me
[40:29] in front of others and I'm not gonna be
[40:31] ashamed of you before the Father and so
[40:34] we've got to testify we've got to
[40:36] confess and cause a confession will lead
[40:39] our life just like David when he went
[40:41] down there to fight Goliath we know that
[40:43] story and he said I'm a I'm gonna cut
[40:45] your head off and you know because he
[40:47] believed God's Word he believed it and
[40:49] and so he he kept marching forward
[40:52] reading God's Word understanding it
[40:55] confessing it speaking it speaking it
[40:58] and going forward and they called
[41:00] Rebecca and said under her wilt thou go
[41:02] with this man and she said I will go and
[41:05] they sent away because see then when you
[41:07] make a confession that's when you get
[41:09] set apart from everybody that's when
[41:10] they sent her away is when she began to
[41:12] speak what God had said about her
[41:15] and I know I'm kind of adding a little
[41:19] bit to the time it doesn't say that she
[41:21] said what God said about her but that's
[41:23] what we're doing in this day as we're
[41:26] reading what God says in the Bible we're
[41:28] listening to what the tapes say we're
[41:29] listening to different ministers and
[41:31] were confessing I believe that you know
[41:34] if we really believe what confessing was
[41:36] about I think that might that would
[41:38] change the way we talk in the parking
[41:40] lot and talk amongst on the phone and
[41:42] everything because your confession is
[41:44] gonna is gonna pull you alone speak it
[41:47] speak and go forward why cry speak and
[41:52] so and then the next little verse that
[41:54] says and Rebecca rose and her damsels
[41:57] and they rode upon the camels and follow
[41:59] the man and the servant took Rebecca and
[42:02] went his way and so she got the back of
[42:06] these camels that we were talking about
[42:08] earlier that you Isaac could look out
[42:10] and see her coming on the camels hey how
[42:14] did she ride on these camels III think
[42:17] these camels speak of something that's
[42:18] happening in our own lives because you
[42:21] know first of all she watered those
[42:22] camels and brother Brown type that he
[42:24] said she watered the camels that were
[42:27] going to take her to her destination you
[42:29] know in this story she watered them at
[42:31] the beginning of the journey but I
[42:32] believe in our journey we're watering
[42:35] them every day of our life we're
[42:37] watering them because we're we we have
[42:39] to you know we really we have to bring
[42:41] the holy spirit in us we have to bring
[42:43] it the word and so we're we keep
[42:45] bringing it the word you've got to eat
[42:47] you got to go to church you got to do
[42:49] all those things and what really what
[42:51] what more can a Christian do is then eat
[42:54] you know we say we say all these
[42:56] different things about praying and
[42:58] fasting and all that kind of stuff but
[42:59] really it all bottles down into just
[43:01] faith you believe you're a Christian and
[43:04] you know like if you go to the zoo and
[43:06] you'll see all of these all these
[43:08] different animals you see a zebra with
[43:10] stripes on its back and what makes that
[43:13] a zebra have stripes on his back it's
[43:14] not doing anything it's not really
[43:17] struggling with in itself to squeeze
[43:19] those stripes out all that's doing is
[43:21] going up to the trough and putting his
[43:23] head in there and eating it eats and it
[43:26] eats and it eats and that's what a
[43:27] believer does that's what a Lamb of God
[43:29] does that's what an eagle does is it
[43:31] where the carcass is the Eagles will be
[43:34] gathered together why because that's
[43:35] what the eagle does is it eats and eats
[43:38] and eats and I think that's where a lot
[43:40] of us have fallen short and this day we
[43:42] we haven't eaten a lot and and so now
[43:45] you you look around across the land and
[43:47] many are finding out that they haven't
[43:49] been eating and so they say well you
[43:51] know I believe the revelation of the
[43:53] hour is that we should be eating and and
[43:55] I would say to you that that sounds a
[43:57] little bit foolish to me that sounds a
[44:00] little bit worrisome do you know because
[44:02] in and the Bible talks about a people
[44:04] that were right there right about the
[44:06] time of the rapture when they would
[44:08] begin to see the bride coming into
[44:09] maturity coming into a place where she
[44:11] knows who she ours who she is and
[44:13] everything she would begin to look back
[44:15] and say do you mean that I'm supposed to
[44:17] have all in my lamp all this time I was
[44:19] supposed to have all and and and do you
[44:22] mean that I was supposed to be listening
[44:24] to the tapes all this time I'm sorry to
[44:27] spoil it for you but the revelation of
[44:29] the hour is not that you should be
[44:30] listening to the tape so you don't have
[44:32] to tell the bride to listen to tapes the
[44:35] bride's gonna be eating you didn't have
[44:36] to tell Rebecca to water the camels
[44:39] Rebecca water that Keller's the first
[44:41] thing she did and and we are water we've
[44:43] been watering the camels all along until
[44:46] is produce something that I would say
[44:48] that that now you can look back and you
[44:50] can know where you are and who you are I
[44:53] believe it's this is the hour of knowing
[44:55] this is an hour of knowing who you are
[44:57] that knowing that that you you have been
[45:00] redeemed that you've been brought out of
[45:03] the world brought out all these things
[45:04] and that that thing that holy thing
[45:06] that's living inside of you is the Holy
[45:08] Ghost and that's what's been keeping you
[45:10] you know I think in brief even brother
[45:13] brother Brown told about that story of
[45:15] sister Sheppard where what she wasn't
[45:17] quiet she didn't quite understand what
[45:19] the new birth was and so she you know
[45:22] she laid on her couch and she had that
[45:23] dream of the stands for a perfect man
[45:25] and after that brother Brennan preached
[45:26] the statue of a perfect man and explain
[45:28] how you have to come through a growth
[45:29] process and all those different things I
[45:31] believe that's what many have been
[45:34] struggling for years with knowing
[45:36] exactly what the new birth is and you
[45:38] know if I can give my own explanation of
[45:40] what the new birth is this the life of
[45:42] Christ living his in you and identifying
[45:44] you with his word and manifesting his
[45:46] characteristics and his attributes in
[45:48] your life and that's that's that's what
[45:51] it is and so now we're in a place where
[45:53] we know what the new birth is and
[45:55] whether or not we have it because we've
[45:57] been eating we've been eating and
[45:59] watering the word watering those cameras
[46:01] what are the camels brother Bram said
[46:04] those camels represent power that was
[46:06] the power that was carrying her to her
[46:10] destination and we have a power it's not
[46:13] just the theology it's not just a letter
[46:15] on the page but there's the power of the
[46:17] Holy Ghost that's transporting us to our
[46:19] destination
[46:20] you know there's another woman over in
[46:23] Revelation that said on a scarlet cover
[46:25] beast
[46:25] or near the scarlet beast and and that's
[46:29] that's a different kind of animal that's
[46:31] a different kind of beast a different
[46:33] kind of power a power of a
[46:34] denominational system power of false
[46:36] doctor and false teaching but we have
[46:39] the power of the incorruptible word this
[46:42] true seed of God that's gonna take us
[46:45] from this mortal realm from this fleshly
[46:48] habitat and transform us by by the
[46:52] renewing power of God's Word and
[46:55] of course we know that that Satan's
[46:57] scheme Satan's schema is debar that from
[47:00] taking place he won't he doesn't want
[47:02] you to catch a hold of that revelation
[47:04] of who you are and so he don't want to
[47:06] keep see the wheat plant come to
[47:08] fruition he doesn't want to see this
[47:10] bride mature into who she really isn't
[47:12] so he lets people like her brother and
[47:15] her mother come in and say things try to
[47:18] get you off of the real Word of God that
[47:21] but there's gonna be the bride is gonna
[47:22] stick right with the word she's gonna
[47:24] stay right true to the word and not
[47:28] deviate to the left or the right
[47:30] and so
[47:32] this is the hour of knowing because the
[47:35] same Bible that speaks of him we were
[47:39] talking about Isaac how at types of
[47:40] Christ the same Bible that speaks of
[47:42] seeing him speaks of you and he's got if
[47:45] you can see yourself and him then you
[47:47] see a picture of your perfection because
[47:49] he's already perfect and if you're in
[47:52] him then that makes you perfect as well
[47:53] if you can see how you the role that you
[47:57] play in him then then you begin to you
[48:01] you begin to get somewhere that the
[48:03] world won't like because that's when
[48:05] they begin to stone him was when he
[48:07] began to say I and my father are one and
[48:10] so in John chapter 10 verse 34 it says
[48:13] in Jesus will begin to offer up an
[48:15] explanation for he's
[48:17] manouse ink to stone me and he said they
[48:19] said because you're saying that you're
[48:21] God and so jesus answered them and he
[48:24] said is it not written in your law I
[48:25] said Ye are gods if he called them gods
[48:29] unto whom the Word of God came and the
[48:31] scripture cannot be broken and I'll say
[48:33] that again the scripture cannot be
[48:35] broken
[48:36] the scripture cannot be broken and it
[48:39] called them God say of him of whom the
[48:42] father has sanctified and sent into the
[48:43] world thou
[48:44] blasphemous because I said I
[48:47] the son of God and see that's that's
[48:51] that great mystery that's being unfolded
[48:53] is that and just to say it plainly that
[48:55] God Himself is tabernacling himself in
[48:57] the people and all together they make
[49:00] the fullness of the Godhead bodily once
[49:02] they have received the word we receive
[49:04] the word and eating it until all the
[49:06] flues are gone all the fluids are
[49:07] cleared up everything's out of the way
[49:09] and now they begin to realize what their
[49:12] position is and I you know I like I like
[49:14] to you know compare that little story
[49:17] that brother Branham talked about and in
[49:19] the Bible of Elijah and Elijah crossing
[49:21] the River Jordan and and they go through
[49:24] a little journey of going to Bethel and
[49:27] Jericho and and then crossing over the
[49:30] River Jordan all along the way you have
[49:31] the school of prophets interfere and
[49:33] Medlin and everything trying to trying
[49:35] to copycat what Elijah was doing with
[49:38] kind of a theological copycat and you
[49:40] know you can't get it about education
[49:42] it's got to come by a revelation but
[49:44] they were trying to get it by education
[49:46] and so they knew that Elijah was gonna
[49:48] go up and they kept telling a lot Elijah
[49:50] what winds are gonna happen where's you
[49:52] know what's what's taking place and and
[49:54] Elijah kept asking Elijah as they went
[49:57] along through their journey are you
[49:58] gonna leave me now and the largest
[50:00] Elijah said I'm sticking right with you
[50:02] which is the type of us keeping our eyes
[50:04] or I don't crawl on Jesus Christ and so
[50:08] they they crossed over the Jordan and
[50:10] and Elisha watched Elijah as he slapped
[50:13] the water with his robe and and the
[50:15] water parted and he went on the cross in
[50:17] the and and he got caught up in the in
[50:19] the fiery chariot after he had promised
[50:21] him if you see me going up then a double
[50:24] portion will fall back on and so he he
[50:26] he he kept his eyes right on Elijah just
[50:30] as we're keeping our eyes right on Jesus
[50:32] and so he he went he walked back and he
[50:36] got back to the River Jordan and he
[50:38] stood there and and and he and he made
[50:40] that statement which brother Brahim said
[50:42] was not a question it was a statement
[50:44] where is the god of Elijah and you know
[50:48] really you could ask asked that same
[50:50] question today where is the god of a
[50:53] logic you notice he didn't say where is
[50:55] Elijah
[50:56] he didn't say where is Elijah and and
[50:58] you know today speaking earlier about
[51:01] the different the thing where there's
[51:03] different people on earth at different
[51:05] times and you know Jesus Christ is not
[51:07] on earth now and Elijah is not on earth
[51:11] now there's only one that's on earth and
[51:14] that you know one being the Bride of
[51:16] Christ the Bride of Christ is what's on
[51:19] earth now so if you were to say where is
[51:21] the god of Elijah yeah I would say the
[51:24] god of Elijah is in you
[51:27] because that's where that's where the
[51:29] god of Elijah is he's in his people and
[51:32] so when you begin to realize where God
[51:35] is
[51:36] then you become an invincible army
[51:39] because what can do what can the devil
[51:41] do with the people that realizes who
[51:44] their God is and then he's doing great
[51:46] exploits today not in a future chance
[51:49] but in a present tense that he's still
[51:51] Hebrews 13:8 he's this same yesterday
[51:54] and today and forever and I want to
[51:59] emphasize today because so times how
[52:01] many times we put him way off in the
[52:02] future but he's the same today right
[52:06] today in this present time and today God
[52:09] is making himself he has made himself
[52:12] manifested in a bride he has for his
[52:15] fulfilling what was hidden in a mystery
[52:18] all through the ages and you know excuse
[52:22] me you say well well where is that in
[52:24] the Bible where is that in the Bible
[52:26] that that God would have a bride who
[52:28] would be the the incarnation of himself
[52:31] that God will manifest himself and
[52:33] that's in Colossians 1 25 to 29 where
[52:35] the scripture that brother Branham used
[52:37] when he was when he was preaching the
[52:39] seven seals he said wherever I made a
[52:41] minister according to the dispensation
[52:43] of God which is given to me for you to
[52:47] fulfill the word of God even the mystery
[52:50] which has been here from ages and from
[52:51] generations but now has made manifest to
[52:54] his Saints to whom God will make known
[52:57] what is the riches of the glory of this
[52:59] mystery among the gentiles which is
[53:01] christ in you the hope of glory but i
[53:04] thought the mystery was the mystery of
[53:06] eliezer that one day god will send a
[53:09] prophet and that we would put everything
[53:11] on that profit now you see how why
[53:13] that's hard to preach that is very
[53:15] difficult to priest because that's true
[53:16] that God would send a prophet and he
[53:18] would be the voice of God to this age
[53:20] but but that voice of God was not just
[53:22] sent so that we could rejoice say that
[53:24] God's in a prophet but there was a
[53:26] purpose behind that voice and that
[53:28] purpose was to produce and prepare
[53:30] Brides so that when she marks his down
[53:32] that how she won't look like in that
[53:35] dream that brother Branham had are the
[53:36] people all around the world dancing and
[53:38] doing the or whatever that they
[53:40] didn't he said I almost almost passed
[53:43] out when he looked at them but he wants
[53:45] to present a bride that is how would she
[53:48] be acceptable to God she will have to be
[53:51] exactly delight Jesus Christ she would
[53:54] have to be the same characteristic she
[53:57] will be have to be identified with him
[53:59] she would have to be the the embodiment
[54:02] of everything that God is and that's why
[54:04] she can take his name that's why when
[54:06] she's turned around and presented this
[54:08] is the bride of Jesus Christ she won't
[54:11] have her own name anymore she'll have
[54:13] his name because he'll have the same
[54:15] characteristics the same things
[54:17] everything will just line up perfectly
[54:19] so that that's why in the book of
[54:22] Revelation it says the spirit and the
[54:23] bride say come because now the voice
[54:26] that was in the bridegroom the voice
[54:29] that he sent down in Eleazar is now in
[54:32] the bride and she's able to speak the
[54:35] same thing
[54:36] and
[54:41] how is she able to do this you know and
[54:44] in the Book of Daniel where it talks
[54:48] about the word of the Lord is a rouble
[54:51] that headstone crying grace grace grace
[54:55] grace that's how she's able to do it by
[54:57] grace it's not anything that you've done
[55:00] it's not because how much you've went to
[55:03] church or how much you've done all these
[55:04] different things not that way although
[55:07] you've got to go to church you've got to
[55:09] eat but it's not the works that you've
[55:11] done it's the work of the Holy Spirit in
[55:14] you living out the life of God in you to
[55:17] produce those attributes you're not
[55:19] you're not going to church to be that
[55:22] way you
[55:23] flip it around right you know we that's
[55:25] why it's so precarious to preach a
[55:27] clothesline religion because you've got
[55:30] to present it in a way that that so that
[55:32] you know you know whether you're wrong
[55:34] or not but the right way of living is
[55:37] that God is producing inwardly from the
[55:39] inside outward and what's on the inside
[55:43] produces outwards and that's why at the
[55:47] end of this little story her outward
[55:50] appearance was correct because she came
[55:53] when he said I saw us he Isaac looked
[55:57] and he saw the camels were coming and
[55:59] her presentation was biblically correct
[56:02] because she had her face veiled why was
[56:05] her face veiled because she was coming
[56:08] to her head that's the same way that a
[56:10] woman covers her head she because she
[56:13] wears her long hair because Paul said
[56:16] because your hair is
[56:20] let me find it real quick he said for
[56:23] this calls out the woman to have power
[56:24] on her head because of the angels
[56:27] what a strange scripture power on your
[56:29] head because of the angels because you
[56:32] know that that when you wear your hair
[56:33] long as signifying that you have
[56:36] believed the message for your day you
[56:39] have believed the Angels message whether
[56:43] that's the seven church age as a
[56:44] messenger message or the angel behind
[56:47] the pulpit you have believed it and
[56:49] received it and now you're under
[56:51] headship and so she was coming with that
[56:54] veil over her face showing just like a
[56:56] bride coming to the to the groom and a
[56:59] wedding coming to her head coming to her
[57:02] she was approaching
[57:04] coming to her headship which is Christ
[57:10] let me read this this quote in from
[57:13] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[57:16] now you can see now and I went longer
[57:20] than I expected but I'll be stopping in
[57:22] just a little bit so don't get too
[57:24] worried I know this is Wednesday night
[57:27] now you can see now the entire message
[57:29] why is rejected now no denomination but
[57:33] the revelation of his mystery see know
[57:36] that I'm nation the revelation God is
[57:38] not known by denomination he is known by
[57:40] revelation look God in his body Christ
[57:44] and Christ in his body the bride oh my
[57:48] God made manifest in Christ Christ made
[57:52] manifest in the bride and as God took
[57:56] from the body of Adam the woman and she
[57:58] fell then God has took from the body of
[58:01] Christ his flesh his body which is his
[58:05] word and is bringing a bride out that
[58:07] won't fall by denomination or creed no
[58:10] sir but she is coming back with a pure
[58:13] unadulterated Word of God being
[58:15] manifested and he says I hope every man
[58:18] that hears this tape and every woman
[58:20] will understand that see
[58:25] so
[58:28] God in his bride
[58:34] and so it says and Isaac brought her
[58:37] into his mother in chapter 24 verse 67
[58:39] Isaac brought her into his mother
[58:41] Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she
[58:43] became his wife and he loved her and
[58:46] Isaac was comforted after his mother's
[58:48] death
[58:50] became his wife and you know that's
[58:52] another thing that's very difficult to
[58:54] type because we become his wife down
[58:56] here and wife signifies union it's the
[59:01] the bride and the groom coming together
[59:03] in perfect ones and we come in perfect
[59:06] oneness together by eating his word and
[59:08] then we go to the wedding supper will
[59:10] where we'll have communion which types
[59:12] what has taken place down here well
[59:15] we've been communing with him by as he
[59:17] said back there and on the shores of
[59:20] Galilee eat my flesh and drink my blood
[59:22] something that they never understood but
[59:25] now we're able to eat his flesh and
[59:26] drink his blood as he said eating the
[59:30] Word of God and having that quickened by
[59:32] his spirit until it becomes a living
[59:34] reality in his life producing mr. and
[59:38] mrs. Jesus Christ because we take his
[59:40] own name and so that's why I wanted to
[59:44] get to the scripture going back to Psalm
[59:46] 82 chapter 6 to 7 where said I have
[59:50] sinned ye are gods and all of you are
[59:53] children of the Most High but you shall
[59:55] die like men and fall like one of the
[59:59] princes you know that's a very word I
[1:00:01] just oddly worded scripture and if you
[1:00:04] look kind of at the original Hebrew of
[1:00:06] these different words it really tells an
[1:00:08] interesting story and I don't get tired
[1:00:11] on me now hang on just a few more
[1:00:12] minutes and I'll wrap up and just
[1:00:15] shortly I have said Ye are gods and you
[1:00:18] know that God that word gods ye are gods
[1:00:20] in this place the underlying word is
[1:00:23] Elohim ye are elohim that many member
[1:00:28] Genesis 1:26 27 that brother Wade spent
[1:00:32] so long trying to explain to us and it
[1:00:34] get us to see ye are gods and all of you
[1:00:38] are children of the Most High but ye
[1:00:40] shall die like me and if you go look at
[1:00:44] what Hebrew word that is that is the
[1:00:46] word Adam you shall die like Adam and if
[1:00:51] you kind of compare that how strange
[1:00:53] that is to have someone that is both God
[1:00:56] and
[1:00:57] man that would die like man and you see
[1:01:01] how a brother branham explained that
[1:01:03] that he put a soul into Adam and then he
[1:01:06] breathed into Adam the breath of eternal
[1:01:09] life just like he breathed into your
[1:01:12] eternal life when you heard the word and
[1:01:14] received and hailed it he breathed into
[1:01:16] your life and to you into your nostrils
[1:01:19] the breath of eternal life and that is
[1:01:22] going to allow you to escape death where
[1:01:25] Adam died now you can escape death
[1:01:28] because you know Adam Adam had a
[1:01:30] sacrifice and that allowed him to keep
[1:01:33] kind of moving the process keep moving
[1:01:35] on and we have a sacrifice that we can
[1:01:38] look to Jesus Christ paid the price for
[1:01:41] us that his life could come back and
[1:01:43] live inside of us and he had told he
[1:01:46] paid the price for our full Redemption
[1:01:48] soul spirit and body and all we have to
[1:01:52] do is eat and if you eat and eat and eat
[1:01:55] then that creates
[1:01:57] deity in
[1:02:00] amen and I'll just I'll just end on that
[1:02:04] note because you know that's a very
[1:02:06] straightforward thing
[1:02:09] so I mean about to be honest is
[1:02:12] something this I suppose would be
[1:02:14] difficult to preach in many churches
[1:02:15] that this mystery that God has
[1:02:18] tabernacled himself in the people that
[1:02:21] you are deity that God has his
[1:02:25] manifesting his bride unveiling this
[1:02:28] mystery that's been sealed for thousands
[1:02:30] of years and now it's made plain to us
[1:02:33] how thankful we should be let's just
[1:02:37] stand to our feet and go to the Lord in
[1:02:38] prayer
[1:02:46] Lord Jesus we're so thankful to you
[1:02:48] tonight Lord God to be able to look into
[1:02:50] your mysteries and see ourself and see
[1:02:54] you Lord God and see how everything is
[1:02:57] put together Lord Lord I believe Lord
[1:03:01] Jesus many are tired tonight and weary
[1:03:03] and everything Lord but to mate maybe
[1:03:05] tomorrow Lord Jesus that you'll just
[1:03:07] bring everything rushing back Lord God
[1:03:09] and maybe inspire someone to dig a
[1:03:12] little bit deeper into the word Lord God
[1:03:13] to see who we are Lord and I pray God
[1:03:16] that you'll just bless the remainder of
[1:03:18] this service Lord Jesus and I pray God
[1:03:20] that you'll help help the people Lord
[1:03:22] God I want with somebody Lord to see who
[1:03:24] they are Lord Jesus because there's a
[1:03:27] there's a pattern to all this we're all
[1:03:29] kind of lumped in this together that
[1:03:31] even if one of us comes to adoption
[1:03:33] we've all got to come to adoption all
[1:03:36] the ones that are born again before we
[1:03:38] can get out of here and so we're
[1:03:40] depending on one another we're depending
[1:03:42] on one another like the Bible says iron
[1:03:43] sharpens iron alright we sharpen one
[1:03:46] another Lord and we're we're all helping
[1:03:48] one another to grow and grace knowledge
[1:03:51] to grow in this word so that we can make
[1:03:53] a body change Lord and I pray Oh God
[1:03:56] you'll just be with this church be with
[1:03:58] all the people but brother Dale Lord
[1:04:00] Jesus and everyone that's present here
[1:04:01] tonight Lord and just bless the people
[1:04:03] we pray bless all the ones that are on
[1:04:05] the road Lord and I pray Lord it's
[1:04:06] you'll be with brother Lewis Lord and
[1:04:08] help him that you'll just put exactly
[1:04:09] the right words in this mouth to speak
[1:04:11] to bless all of the people down there
[1:04:13] Lord Lord you'll just help him to be a
[1:04:16] great blessing Lord and be with him
[1:04:17] through all of the the troubles and
[1:04:19] things that come with going to another
[1:04:20] country and the duress as well or God a
[1:04:23] granite I pray Lord it's your presence
[1:04:25] would be with them all the during the
[1:04:26] next couple of months Lord Jesus we just

[1:04:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
