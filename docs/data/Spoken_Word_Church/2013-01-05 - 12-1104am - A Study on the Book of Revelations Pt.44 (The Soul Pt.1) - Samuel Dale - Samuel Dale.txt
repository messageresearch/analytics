sick among us you promised it in your word said you'd send your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction so we believe that please have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 this makes 44 times reading it maybe we'll remember it the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right Revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them now notice he saw the souls of them right that worst line they get killed right and go there he's not looking as I'll repeat in a minute he's not looking at physical corporal people no you know he's looking at the soul all right of that individual right all right and I saw under the altar The Souls of them which were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true do thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto to every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word we had a real great time last night at the Bible study you you know talking about sanctification and getting down into her own lives and just dealing with uh you know who we are right amen and what we're doing and try to find out why that we need to die out to oursel more and that's that's the thing we need right right now as we spoke the last message on you know trying to brother fory preaching this past Wednesday and uh but we were speaking about how that this group of people that John is speaking of it calls them Souls mhm under the altar right all right now then in being that are souls of them when brother Ram would get in and say Souls under the altar as I said then he's not talking about bodies and things like that but he's talking about souls of them all right now that's I've always tried to preach to you since the Lord showed it to me many years ago and my wife was asking me when it was and I don't know it back in the 80s somewhere that I put serieses in about the soul dra it out put it on cardboard and everything to try to help people to understand if you'll go back into that on the on your internet computer you'll find that and by the way we're having trouble with not our system but their system and we're not ba where in today's services will not be live according to brother Joe it's their problem it's not us but we've had trouble with them in doing it you know but it's their problem they said they' get it straight but just pray they will don't but now seeing that these are actually it it's it's not a body that's there not a human body you know not a mortal 16 element body no cuz it says The Souls of them right that were killed see right and were killed down here right and this is not a bodily form like we look at it as a mortal body but it's more real right than a mortal body that's what we want to deal with to try to get an understanding of what we're talking about now let's just take a few quotes and review a little bit back where we were to see who this is and why the prophet would give it unto us and then it'll unfold into some things that we can uh think about go ahead and pull up number one brother Anderson and look what your Prophet says this is paragraph 104 the six seal he said I always allowed them Souls under the altar to be the early Christian Martyrs right yep know he was confused on it himself right but we found out last night when the Lord broke that seal for us it absolutely is impossible it wasn't them it wasn't the martyred Christians or anything what was it why because they were gone on the glory come on the other side and there there was well see I like that to be able to say this is this way it can't be that way right you know you what do you call it the law of of percentage or the pointing out and see I like to follow the prophet where he says this can't be right you know the early Christians he said I thought it was until the seal broke right right so it can't be see all right and it was what we found out that they were the Jews that would come up during the time where the from the calling now the 144,000 which we get into tonight tomorrow and between the sixth and seventh seal 144,000 is called all right now he's not calling the fifth seal Jew the 144,000 right he say that's in between this is in between here you all right so what is it then we found out that they were Martyrs that had been killed and yet had not been had white robes on but their names had been on the L book of life and they were given white robes each one of them all right see that's why church we are an honored I'm not talking about just Lula right I'm talking about the people of the end time righten we are the most honored people corre that could ever be to be able to say that a prophet said this is what it ISL we're not in the well what is your input I don't like that I'd rather output and leave the building but what is your input of what you think this is well we teach it over here is this way well there's no way to have any faith but the problem is is why is it that we have the prophet's message that says this and we still want our own ideas I don't understand that right we still want our opinion well maybe he was wrong D you know well then he's not a prophet that's right right right that's sensible show me where the prophets in the bible was wrong yes Miss understood right because why because they spoke in a spiritual realm right and man was trying to understand them in a carnal right natural realm that's right right so that it's easy to misunderstand when a prophet said this is it and this is why that's what I like right amen other words this can't be right what more you mean it can't be because the prophet said it can't be right right all right then we're going to believe it that way if not let's quit quoting the prophet am go to our own ideas and our own thoughts I know the prophet said it this way but I think but around said that's what happened in the garden amen and that's what Eve done that's right and C all of these deaths yes sorrows and heartaches right because she said I think that's why I'm always say it the Constitution of the United States gives you a right to think but the Bible don't give you a right to think right well who are you I'm me who are you I'm saying the prophet's right and he shows why he believes it this way and see that way then you don't have to worry about it right then he goes on to the next one what he said to who who these were going to number two this is 21:18 of the fifth seal for they at this time if you notice this fifth seal being opened see the church is gone right it just can't be theold under the early church that that used to say I like what brother Maloney used to say he put TP he go down to his Bible and he put TP I said what that TP mean he said tried and proven then we'll to be able to stand on that if not let's eat drink and be married cuz tomorrow we die that's right but if we're going to believe it let's walk on Amen and he said if you ever did give attention now give attention why cuz this is a great controversy this feel seal so I want you to listen real close now you got your papers and everything write it down and these cannot be them Souls because the souls of of the righteous Marty and the righteous people the church the bride to know has done been took up y so they wouldn't be under the altar they've been Glory with the bride and watch for they are gone in a Rapture in the fourth chapter of Revelation and they was taken up and who are these Souls then see that's the next thing who are they then if they are not the early church this is Israel this is to be saved as a nation y all of them that are predestinated that's Israel that's Israel itself you say wait a minute you know in other words right people were sitting there arguing with him in their mind and he was telling them to hold on right but see it's Israel to be saved as a nation now we never knew Israel was to be saved as a nation right that's right you see why it's a controversy right we never knew that did you I'm asking you did you know Israel was ever to be saved as a nation now we all mangled up and you know right well why couldn't that be the 144,000 then maybe that's the Israel to be saved as a nation but you see that won't work right no all right the reason that won't work is pull up num three we'll read the scripture you know us take it get it out of the way and when it opened a f seal I saw Under The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held doesn't say for the blood of Jesus Christ is testimony they held all right that's one point and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord only in trth do thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth can't be the bride cuz she don't want for Revenge right no right she says father forgive them just like right he said forgive them right all right so that's two reasons for not believing you but look at the next and white roads were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were right should be fulfilled who is that 144,000 so now you're you're taking things out of the way that would be there in the questioning in your mind or you should be see that's why that I just keep pounding on something I know you say I'm going to hear this but you're going to hear it again you know why cuz you're the person that's not getting it if you ever have the thought in your mind that you're getting bored over what I'm saying you are the person that is not getting it wake up get a little common sense right right right I don't like the door is back there that's right I'm not trying to run nobody off but I'm not going to beg nobody to say why because that's your choice right you're a free more agent you see then the truth has to be placed is the truth and then we can take our own choice that's right all right now let's go into something and look at the next one we done read these but just going back over it 454 paragraph the fifth seal all right now we found out in Revelations 228 the same thing now or to settle it for those who know Souls now watch it under the alar of the breaking of this seal that had been slain were in the time between the death of Christ and the going up to the church now there's the Israel to be saved right yep you remember I was bringing it out last weekend the Old Testament Israel had a Redemptive under the blood of bulls and goats that's right they had a place to go to right the bosom of Abraham that was provided so it's not this group of PE this group of people is not the Old Testament people right you see you see why they have their Redemptive right they had their plan they have their their paradise and it was taken up but now if there is an Israel to be saved as a nation and to be saved between the calvary and the end time of the going of the church what are you going to do with them right what is their Redemptive plan where can they go to right you understand yes you've got to have a place a position a Redemptive plan for everybody right sure will it be foolish virgin they have theirs the Old Testament Jew had theirs right we have ours M the 144,000 has theirs well what about it if you're going to believe that this is Israel as a nation to be saved now you got to have a place you got to have a redemp for a form of redemption and you got to have a place that they can go to right so John plainly tells you and the the prophet verifying it this is the souls under the altar not in the presence of Jesus Christ the bride goes up into glory amen I can't explain it but even the Old Testament Israel went up to some place but Paradise was taken up we know that they didn't go into the presence of Jesus Christ because no man has approached the immortality so they're not there in bodies right but what are you going to do with this group of people if you're going to believe what he said here that we read this is this to be saved as a nation what are you going to do with them well we need to understand this yeah that means you don't understand right is that blunt enough if you say that we need to understand this that means you don't understand this because why would you not want a Plan of Redemption for everyone right what kind of a holy state are you in that you wouldn't want Redemption for everybody right there something wrong with you mentally look Al spiritually I know that I'm talking to all but I'm like brother brand I listen to him the other day he said sitting right here in this building he said there's two groups of people he said one of them just paraphrasing it is dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ and all things to take him through said the other group is trying to figure out a way to work yourself somewhere but he said they're right here well I'm saying it right here now anybody out there is listening I'm not pastoring the world I'm not their Pastor don't send me your tith from out there I'm not your pastor but now if you want to listen and see if it'll help you that's wonderful that's right but For Heaven's Sake don't be a group of people that's lazy shiftless bums this morning that wouldn't get up to go to church so you can turn on the internet and call Brother Dale your pastor that's right okay is that being hateful no no it's truthful right cuz I'm not your pastor the word of God is your pastor all right now you say well brother Dale I'm your pastor well then all right if I'm your pastor we got a email address and you're TI to go in the box and if it don't go in the Box I ain't your pastor right there you go I've been aiming to say this because of the fact of the way people are see we have people that do listen that do cend her time sure but it's because of their choice CU they say I'm their pastor but just you know okay but listen what are you going to do with this group of people that is between the death of Christ and the going up the church you got to have a place for them right why because they're already basically most of them done been killed right cuz the church a went up yet so they could be more killed to me that's why that that he's going back and covering in in in the scripture that to be killed is they're killed right because at the time John was writing that he was looking forward and the people were going to be killed as fifth seal Jew but you got to have Redemption for them so now where's your Redemption they do not accept Jesus Christ as their savior no foolish virgin 144,000 bride right right they have a Redemptive plan through the blood of Jesus Christ right it may even be the white Throne as a foolish virgins and the people would receive it to it may be there but it's still a Redemptive plan right but now what do you do with this group of people I read a quote the other day to you know want to go back to it read want to make sure see but who does he say this is the people have been slay according to this seal between the death of Christ and the going up of the church he says the ikan group and all of that them true Jews with their names on the book right that's the Book of Life That's not the Lamb's Book of Life section The Book of Life if you watch my brother according to the scripture now I want you to remember this for later on and I took this out because it's a total repeat in just a minute but I want you to remember this these people that are the soldier of them that were slain M their names were on the book and if you watch my brother according to the scripture they could talk cry out speak hear and had all five senses not sleeping in the grave unconscious see that's what people think we get a minute so sleeping they think that when you die you just go down and they'll quote your scripture The Dead Know Nothing and they think you just in coma you gone nothing of you Body Spirit soul is alive anywhere that's what mankind believes because they know nothing about the dimensions and the heavens and the things that's right but look what we have by way of the Prophet amen that's right to explain to us all of these things that's right we don't have to worry right so keep that in your mind they're not sleeping in the grave unconscious they were very much awake and they could talk speak hear anything else is that right is that right they could do it because what do they do they say to how long how long to avenge our blood right all right they could talk right all now what about it then what are you going to do with them h look at the next quote number five paragraph 120 questions and answers on the seals now yes these Jews are not not all the Jews will be saved no sir now see he didn't say every Israelite or every Jew or anything between Calvary and the church going up was going to be saved he didn't say that and that's what he's saying no not all the Jews will be saved they will not be saved only those who when he's speaking of the Jew Jew is just a name that was given to them after they left I believe Nebuchadnezzar over here is really a tribe of Judah as he goes down right begin to call him jeude first because the tribe of Judah was taken then and given a name of Jew now because they came down from Judea and they that got the name Jew but now Israel is different watch it Israel and Jew is all together different right all right every Jew every Jew isn't an Israelite right you go over there now and and they could maybe prove the tribe they come from but does that I'm going to be saved no we've had that explained to us every Jew is in Israelite see no he's just a Jew but then Israel Paul never said all Jews will be saved right and we went through that in Romans right 11 he said all Israel will be saved right amen now that's what Paul said in Romans we went through that to the verses huh he says why why will all Israel be saved why Israel's name that's the name of Redemption all the way back see and Israel will be saved but not all Judah Judah Judaism will be saved he's not that away now watch there tells you that this group of people right we know who it is yep right it's the Jews the Israelites the true ones that their names remain on The Book of Life not removed that died under persecution between Calvary and the going up of the Bride so we know who that is all right we know that they have a Redemptive plan m he said what is it it's the name of Israel that God said Jacob your name will no longer be Jacob it's going to be Israel right now wouldn't them Jews over today love to be able to think that their name was changed from Jew to Israel right so now they got a redemp you say well what and how it's through the fact that Jesus Christ died right but that he blinded his own people it's not every Jew not ever as we call it people of Israel the nation no they're going to even turn against 144,000 would even kill them right we'll get on into that later but think of it see because of the name of Israel and Israel being the name of redemption and that's only through the blood of Jesus Christ right cuz they can't depend upon the blood of bulls and goats right that's done gone that was the paradise that was the thing of the Old Testament that was taken up right so they have their even though they don't believe in Jesus J Christ but Jesus Christ at Calvary he said father forgive him right amen amen and the Bible said it the prophet said he blinded his own people that's right Paul said all Israel is not Israel all Jew but he said I have a people that I would be a Cast Away y from my people if it would save them y right who was it Elijah that said well Lord I'm Elisha one said I'm the only one that's left yeah God opened his eyes and he seen there was 7,000 that's right that hadn't even bowed the knee right right and Israel is crying out the Bible says far as people for him to be saved that give them Redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ that they wouldn't even have well I just can't understand that Brother D because that that that by is Jesus Christ you tell me how you got saved yeah come on right that's right did you get saved believing in Jesus Christ or was it Jesus Christ running you down which one was it right my Bible and Prophet says no man sought God at any time he come after us amen you don't cow right amen you might have to eat some of it the name of Redemption all the way back right all right so we have the Redemptive plan for them we know who it is we have the Redemptive plan for them now where are they going sold under the altar not under the Martyr I mean not under the uh Christian part but under the Martyr part right for their testimony so they have a place to go they can go as we'll get to it later they can go beyond the curtain of time they have a place we just read it right the soul hold of them it doesn't say bodies and spirit says the souls right what is a soul that's what we want to get to right now it's so beautiful how the prophet will disprove things that we thought we believed that's right and he'll tell us why right he said this can't be the bride no and he said it's not the 144,000 because we just read in the scripture there's a difference between this group of people that's under the fifth seal and the 144,000 right and he tells us where they're redeemed and where they can go to when that person Di say right now somewhere say they're still being killed and we know they are over there and that person dies he didn't go in the state of limbo yeah sleep no even the Lost don't do that right you want Bible did not Jesus talk talk about the man who lifted up his eyes in hell so he had eyes right and he cried out I'm being tormented so he had feelings and he was concerned about his Brethren amen that s somebody up there to talk to him that's right do even the Lost y has a place to go right he said hell burning no he say not burning now he said be a pleasure right he said it's a constant falling he said I've been privileged to go to both places and you say well brother I don't understand that cuz how did he go to hell well he went somewhere some way cuz he said he did right right but I don't know of any other Mortal on Earth outside of Jesus Christ that done that so he was given an opportunity but what about it see that's what I'm trying to get you to read the seals and not read to just well what is this FAL that's that's sold to them that were beheaded see brother R said he take one seal and tie the the entire Bible together that's so you see then what he just said the Plan of Redemption through Israel you could preach the rest of your life off of The Plan of Redemption CU you go back in the Old Testament and bring it all the way down right amen you know that your Redemption comes by being listen not a natural nation of an Israelite but you become an Israel at heart and the Bible don't have any problems calling you a Jew as inward right because even a Jew that's inward is a chosen right right go Judah was chosen out of all the tribes for Jesus Christ to come to Judah that's right right so we see we're still in the Bible that's what I like about reading see and and get in there and read it yep and then see where it applies to you you and I amen amen and he's covering that these people have feelings they can remember they can reason but who are these it's the soul of them it says right that was killed so the soul must be the real you that's right and we'll get back to it later we're soul in spirit and interchangeable but we'll use it today to show you one thing for certain but around in the 40s and 50s said your soul is the nature of your spirit he also said that in 1963 on soldiers in prison you didn't change that point cuz you don't have to change it amen the soul is the nature of the spirit right we'll get to that in a minute where people mess up they say it's just the nature of spirit there's no quote and brother around message run it and see come tell me anybody in the world coot bring it to me the word brother around ever said the soul is just the nature of the spirit no he always said the soul is the nature of the right well why are you so technical I'll read do this a minute I give it to you now if you say the soul is just the nature of the spirit you're leaving it just like an animal that has a nature dogs are not cats right they don't act like them see when you say it's just the nature you're belittling it you're bringing it down right and remember this point that you can be Anointed with the spirit of God the genuine Holy Spirit Y and be lost and die and go to hell right right see then don't play with things brother Dale you're just too they were saying like not that I shouldn't say anymore that I was too what was it too stub because everybody refers to stubborn as being like witchcraft so they told me I needed to use something like that I'm just I'm I'm firm I'm Stern you know maybe not but if everybody don't understand that being you know just being me I am me I've been this way all of my life right amen and God made me this way right that's right yeah did he made made me to a place that I'm just playing out me and I ain't going to bow to nobody's ideas but I will be corrected by The Prophet's message amen but not your opinion no right or concept that you have that will not fit the scripture I said when I was in the Baptist Church people had dreams of me being a preacher at time I said then I said if I ever do I won't preach man ideas I didn't know brother Rand said that but I did I said I won't preach man's ideas I said I'll preach the word of God the best I understand of course you know everybody says that right sure right you ever heard a preacher said he didn't preach the word of God true is no no they don't say that but listen Church let's think about what does these things reveal right it's like we're talking about in the you know that first seal second seal third fourth you know at the for seal revealed death and showed us really what death is but see we're reading it to just to find out the little quotes of what the symbols mean instead of reading it to see what it say into you and I let's think about this as we go into it go ahead with number seven paragraph 435 and then go into 438 on this one quote on the fifth seal I do not think by the opening I do think rather by the opening of this fifth seal as I believe that it's open to us it did with good conscience I did with it with good conscience with clear Revelation from God now that's wonderful not trying to just make it think because I always was against organization never will belong to them but it's open to me now Look and I do think another thing by the opening of this fifth seal in this day straightens up a Doctrine right here that I might speak of not the feel it's going to straighten out a Doctrine right amen not just that who this is that mankind has taught and that he always taught that it was the early Christians that's straightened out now he's going to show you something that straightened out that's a very simple thing just a few paragraphs and then he goes right on M and I do think another thing by the opening of this F seal in this day straighten up a Doctrine right here that I might speak of of Soul sleeping now I realize that there are people in here that does not believe that I mean does believe that excuse me see in the soul Fleet all right brother run it over run up number eight let me read number eight up number eight let's read it you got it now he'll explain where this Doctrine is from then we'll drop back now brother back up to where we were reading all right and this is off 1954 questions and answers real to uh paragraph 24 and now many people the Adventist people now he's telling you who believes and has taught this like this the Adventist people believe that when a man dies that he goes right into the grave and stays there now watch soul body and everything else until the resurrection see like I said they give you scripture dead no nothing you just go into what would you go into cuz you rotten they they know your body rottens but everything just goes into the grave and just stays in some way you know and what they call that Soul sleeping he said well that's all right as long as they believe in being born again cuz I love the way brother R very nice about yeah MH but then you see that sth day adventage people in things right which is the basics of most religious people today right that if you die you're just gone you're just finished well if you're that way then what good is your Doctrine because uh uh a person that don't even believe in God would believe that cuz they got no sense to know you die but they think that's the end of it you know my brother is a Methodist Minister 12 years of college and everything else and he believes that the day you die is the end of the world to you that there's no end of the world it's just the day you die that's the end of the world to you cuz you g see you don't realize church right what an opportunity you and I have had Amen to at least hear the truth whether we believe it or not at least to be able to hear it not to argue it right but to believe it drop back into the the fifth seal number number seven come back up all right straighten out of doctor you're Soul sleeping I think this PR is pro that they're not sleeping they are alive they're bodies are sleeping but the soul not in the grave y they're in the presence of God under the altar right he can talk about a FAL Jew being in the presence of God under the altar yep where are you at if you die presence of God under the altar that's right there's only one dimension that can cure all and that's the sixth Dimension amen the sixth Dimension will carry all of those who are in any form religious matters Christians or whatever that's where we go to and we die you mean we're all going to be no no no he ain't going to be mingled together right no you going to be there with your people right he tells who he differs with the one that was teaching it the man that had itah Smith the doctor author of Daniel's Revelation now you people who are follower of his teachings now I don't I'm not just don't want to say this arrogantly but I just see but brother Smith and trying to support now this is a reason he tried to support and trying to support Soul sleeping there he mentions that the soul sleep and there is no altar of sacrifice in heaven now that's what the men taught and what that the only alter spoke of that he believes in in heaven is the alar of incense but to you dear people and not to differ with my brother differing with my brother oh probably to meet him in the on the other side not different with that great teacher but just to show you how this disproves that it disproves that the opening of this seal in this last days it just takes Soul sleeping out of the way see they're alive they're not dead right they're alive right as I said they even call out for Revenge y y they have feelings in things and it says the soul of them right now listen I know this I studied it since back in the the Baptist I knew back then that the word Soul and Spirit can be an interchangeable form Butz I studied the word back then and looked up things back then you know cuz I wanted to understand it and I knew the Bible and what it would say but you remember one thing now we'll get on over in a minute the Bible says the soul that sinth shall die doesn't say say the spirit that sent it right that's right right Jesus's Spirit when he died on the cross went back to God who gave it his soul is what went to hell right his soul is what came back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right because you don't want just the anointing of the spirit right right all right now what is a soul how real is it right now even if you're lost you have a place to go to you die look around see it's got a downward pool you got a place to go to but Rand will even call it a Celestial body one time he called it a theoy of a sinner we will get to those things but what is a soul well brother D is just the Nature's Spirit now there's where you go and see just the nature of the spirit that is not even the truth that is not even a quote the soul is the nature of the spirit right always has been and always will be amen whether it be in brother Brown's early Ministry or later ministry right right amen the old is the nature the spirit right but Brother D I've always thought it was just the spirit of God that comes down to give me a new birth you better change your thinking that's right cuz remember body to body he's my brother Spirit to Spirit he's my God soul to soul he can live inside of amen amen right now we're going to get out to where brother Rand will say it on the fifth seal right on down below there he said that's where I saw my people yeah man not under the altar with them Jews or Israelites he's referring to where they're at now right we got a Plan of Redemption the blood of Jesus Christ and then you burth amen we've got a place to go to to abide there and what goes there Soul the body don't go the spirit don't go right the soul now watch it over and over cuz I'm going to keep quoting whether you like it or not the two Soul people that was their Doctrine the man that brought that and started that that's the way he quoted it and that's the way all you two Soul people quote it well what do you mean soul soul is just the nature that's Pur well what's the real you I'm talking about what's his thoughts are the real you right would it be the body it must have been because he wound up with a couple two or three little girls running around so what was his thoughts are the real you what's your thoughts to the real you let go ahead to number nine this is a message Grace now notice the dates and then you'll get back over a minute you'll see in 63 that he says the same point 1954 106 law Grace paragraph 100 the first man went away under the law under animal's blood it couldn't change his heart he could be anointed right do great things kill a barer kill a line a giant even sing in the spirit yeah what you go an animal life won't compare with human life the animal can't give the human blood right right see the animal can't do it cuz his life is a different life and an animal has a life but not Soul now he's got a nature about him M right bird dogs dogs rabbit dogs they didn't even teach them to talk they got an elephant you see that paper the day they got an elephant now they can turn his trunk up into his mouth and speak Japanese I think he is he don't speak English cuz he's not an English elephant get you the life but they said it was audible words of their language because he was taught in their language he's been taught English he spoke English and an animal has a life but not a soul an animal is a living being but not a soul amen but God put a soul on man and see there is where people put a soul on there's where your two Souls said the nature of the just the nature of the spirit and he just put that on you uhuh your soul is your real you right amen we're going to read just a second where the Bible said the soul that's sin it so die not the spirit that's sin right right right so watch what he says so then my soul what is the soul that's what he says what does he say it is the nature of the spirit that's perfectly wonderful right and when this soul of Christ was left not left in hell but was taken up through the blood shedding of his blood when God taken him up to Calvary and mingled his blood out there on the cross you saying forgive them all kind of thing blood running now watch the scripture will get to it in a minute said he never left his soul in hell you know what they're teaching now in the message dumb preachers amen is that plain enough to get you to wake up they're teaching that Jesus sinned now I want to quote or the Bible I know you quote so don't send me your stupid on he died for me amen it was my sins he never sinned he was almighty God right because see they're trying to disprove that he's God they saying Jesus done wrong come on if you want to sit in my office later I'll tell you who these are but we're not on public big name preachers that's correct that you are listening to that's exactly correct amen say it Jesus died a sinner I know he did did cuz he had my sins it wasn't his sins if Jesus sinned he was not God Amen and we're following a false Doctrine to try to believe in God that would sin that's right well I got a quote come on I got a couple of too Jesus Judas died and went to hell you go too is that your words for the prophet you said you shouldn't be that way you you get all yes I get all upset whether you like it or not or call it mad I get upset of the preachers in this message that's packing down the poor old people's troes the only reason that internet's working is on account of that right because I was cut off from being able to preach that's right you know yourself I ain't went and preach nowhere have I why cuz I ain't been invited did you see now it's open the internet I can call them all kind of names can I that's right I'm not aggravating and hateful I love them sure I was listening the other day with brother R he said I'm not doing this yeah because of a Doctrine he said I'm doing this to straight out a doct he preached the straighten out do amen that's right amen he preached the truth that straighten him out amen why can't we believe it right it's kind of like we the old building here was and we had the tapes over here on the wall and the Man Came Here used to come get tapes and you know you come to church he come get tapes R around so he come here one day and he said you know God had to straighten out brother Bram I don't forget it I did I ain't going to argue with you right he went on a little while he said you had straighten him out like Jesus had to straighten out John the Baptist that got my temper or right indignation or whatever you want to call it I don't care cuz it ain't going to make me a dollar either way I told him I said wait just a minute I said I put up with you throwing off on brother brandom cuz I didn't want to argue with you about it cuz that's your opinion that's your idea but I said you show me where Jesus straighten John the Baptist out I said he come to introduce the Messiah right amen Jesus bragged on him that's y but you see that was 40 years ago what do you think people are thinking today sure brother Rand is wrong here brother's wrong if Satan can get into your mind that brother brandom was wrong you are defeated I'm going to say it whether you like it or not there is no Rapture for that form of people I'm talking about a change in a moment the twinkling of an eye there's no change in a w quickling either a person that believed brother R was wrong and then if you're stupid enough to believe that Jesus right done wrong is they're saying right and even sin I say this much there ain't even no hopes of that person to come up in the first resurrection that's right whether you like it or not that's plain now come on Amen you come and show me where it is I think it's time to just put it down and forget it amen amen what are we going to do oh but brother T you don't understand that's a good brother hell's going to be full of good brother that's what it was made for it was made for the devil and his angels and if that's what we believe we got to be one of his angels you said what brother Dale than you Lord I'm trying to save your soul if you're upset with me because I'm trying to save your soul I'm sorry right cuz I spent my life trying to save the soul to the people in this building I give everything that I've had to do that to try to speak to my kids I come so close to quitting yes but then I look back and say well what are they going to do right that's right I ain't the only people on the beach ain't never said to be but what people going to do if somebody don't tell the truth that's right amen praise the Lord amen that's it if I die and go to hell you let me go to hell I can go happy right because I've done what I believe to preach the truth of God that's right but who wants to hear it I can sit and tell people said I proved in 74 that we could pass the year 2026 my brother rown message and not a person yet has asked me to explain that of wine that I said right not a person so they don't want to hear they think I'm just s a date that way no I just proved by the Bible by The Prophet's message but who wants to hear it when the two Soul people were going around with their soul and all that people just running all over the country some of you were caught in it whether you want to agree with it or not you were caught in that Doctrine and have I become your enemy because I told you the truth if you got two Souls you got two Lords so this put the two Lord people together with the two Soul people then you got a whole lot of people right what is the soul what brother H is this is a real me all what's the real you what happens the day you die really know you got have a place to go to amen that's right yep no matter where you Christian or where you sin you got have somewhere to go to where you going I don't think we need to know that will Tire up half of your Bible and 3/4 of the prophet's message oh mer and burn it what a man told me one time he said gifts ain't no gifts no more God laid them on the shift said you order to turn that out of the Bible there where it talks about yes I said hand me your Bible you better believe he didn't hand me his Bible cuz I would have ripped it out you say destroy the word of God no I destroy his Bible cuz he didn't believe in it right right that's right see we think oh that's so beautiful though did you hear that brother he said that you ought to tire that out of your Bible well see the devil just planted a seed of unbelief into your heart now you're going to have to have that seed torn out or it's going to kill you that's right mhm one of the two right right when the seed is Planet it's got to produce itself or be killed right amen what is our choice right so what is a soul the prophet said he said it's the nature of a spirit but he just got to explaining that an animal had a nature right M dogs don't act like cats no right it's the nature of the dog right and see are we just a higher form of an animal what's the difference he didn't put a soul the prophet said in an animal show me the Bible that's right he put a nature in the animal yeah a nature of a spirit but he didn't put a soul right you know what is it then I know forgive me it's forgive me for being me but trying to save your soul I'll give my life to try to save your soul had people to say brother Dale you're a prophet I've come to this pull pit and denied it go that's wrong I am not a prophet I'm talking about the five-fold ministry they say no I'm not I'm just a member of the body of Christ if you want to call me anything call me a teacher that's all right but don't call me a prophet cuz I don't have that Ministry if I had that Ministry this church would be empty because I'd call your sin out that's what a prophet does right okay so now listen the soul of Christ was not left in hell right right what the Bible say so now not leave his soul in hell right no and watch divided nor suffer my holy one right to see cor right y the Holy One was the body he was living in right yep so he wouldn't let that rotten in the grave right but the Bible said the soul yep I'll not leave his soul in hell that's right he went to hell we go over and over and over because of my sins did he go to hell right amen right he didn't go to hell to just preach to the souls that was in prison can never be saved he took my sin right and deposited in hell where the devil was at right amen but brother so and so so sweet Brother D he's not like you okay it's all right but there's one thing about it you'll hear the truth and you'll make your choice all right go ahead with number 10 look at the scripture Ezekiel 18:4 what does it say All Souls Are All Souls are mine right that's right it doesn't say the Christians right it says all soul amen there can't be a soul that God didn't create all right now order to do away with what you're thinking about a nature of anointing because Satan can pervert your nature yes he can anoint you and make you to what he wants you to be right look All Souls are mine whether you be a Christian or Christian you understand All Souls it doesn't say just the Christians are mine no no no All Souls are mine right as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine y so it doesn't make no difference where what you are see all of it is watch the soul that sinth y it shall die right now give me a scripture where it says the spirit that sth it shall die so you better begin to realize the soul is more real than your spirit right it's more real than your body right it's the thing you're going to when you die not going to but it's where you are look at this one 10 a fear not them which kill the body Matthew 10:28 right but are not able to kill the soul ain't nobody nobody nowh Satan nobody can kill the soul of individual right God is the only one that can kill the soul right yep but fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell right right amen let's go back 61 get the next 11 message called faith and look paragraph 7 61813 for Faith now the soul is that part of you who knows and understands your intelligence but brother day I back for seals broke would you read the next verse somebody read it the vision I had not long ago the vision he had not long ago what you talking about yeah be beyond the curtain of time so the soul is a part of you that you you who knows and understands your intelligence right so then the animal has the intelligence of a spiritual condition because he's a spirit but he doesn't have a soul that can reason things out you can teach him to bark yes as where we the other day and haven't stopped by there and see him we go where we used to Camp Tre Vander and they had a dog and that old dog you could say booger old dog you say booger booger Bo look at that old dog say booger booger booger they got them now that can make all more sentences they ain't got them they can do everything in the world looks like like smarter than some of us human and I admit it but they got to be trained cuz they can't reason that's right they have a reasoning ability don't misunderstand that point MH because of being a spiritual condition they have a reasoning ability to them I guess you could call it but they can't reason they have don't no soul that's right their intelligence is what's trained that's right right now don't don't get on to me about it but the bird dog comes out being able yeah cuz that's his nature cuz that's in his Gene his makeup but look we not reading the soul is that part of you who knows and understands so is it just the nature of your spirit if it's just the nature of your spirit you only deal with memories and conscious affections imagination imagination won't give you everything no right you remember the vision I had not long ago where a little translation went into that place and saw those people now now your spirit will come back to that body watch you and that that kind of a body the soul which is a body that does not have to eat and so forth you remember beyond the curtain of tell me didn't have to eat see I've corrected my own things I used to believe just like everybody else basically today believes it I used to believe that you was a trown being body even I can quote with him is being before the the uh 62 brother around basically taught basically that it's Body Soul Spirit then after the then after 62 when the greatest battle ever fought he taught Body Spirit and soul we'll go through that cuz I've been over that and over that for 40 years but see just take whatever the realm is the body has five senses CJ feel smell here Spirit has memory reason constant affection Love Etc the soul only has one sense is either Faith or now right that's right you see I didn't believe your soul had any feelings that it was the essence of love but there would be no imagination memory reason I went back one day and read where the Prophet went beyond the curtain of time he said they had their senses said well Lord I got to go to the church and tell them I was wrong y so I came up here and told you where WR that cuz I couldn't see the soul had to sense just like that but even the Dead come on that's right he's saying send somebody back up there to talk to them people he still got his feelings cuz that's the soul of the man right go back over now your spirit we'll get to it after while what know this I'm going to quit on this club we'll get back to it where the Bible says your spirit goes back to God who gave your body goes to the Grave your spirit goes back to God Soul goes under the altar all right now but the main thing I'm trying to get you to see and that kind of a body the soul which a body that does not what have to eat and so forth when he's beyond the curtain of time he didn't eat huh now look at the scripture is if the Earth Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting what is that there is a Celestial body there is a terrestrial body the celestial body is a Heavenly Body right even the sinner has a soul right y why because he's not just an animal p all we have one way a Celestial body and with that spirit and that soul and Celestial body you raise again this natural body for that great Millennium right what is the soul of an individual it's a being it's what you are right amen it's more real than your body right it's more real than your spirit y it's the thing that God is working on right amen I'm quoting and he never changed from his early Ministry when he said the soul is the nature of the spirit right and changed that over in after he the opening of the seals he still was believing it the soul is the name through the spirit cuz it is if the Holy Spirit comes and lives in our heart by the new birth would not that be our nature amen right amen right because it's the nature of the spirit and the nature of the holy spirit is to live right and do right it's that I told him last night maybe I shouldn't say things blunt but there's people in this message that I know of and some of you know of them that they actually have had fights in churches physical fights over doctrines now you think I'm going to fool with that kind of people I ain't going back you start one now we going to get the law and you going out of here and you ain't coming back I will fight not physically but I'll sure borrow the doors because there's no such thing in Christianity that could have anything to do with physical fighting I thought we supposed to turn the other cheek but what is the soul we'll get back on it this afternoon the soul is the real you the soul is the part of you that lives on after death it's more real than this physical body you're looking at brother R said you never seen the real man right amen he said you see the body I'm inhabited Jesus gave his soul remember the spirit left him in the garden and even on the cross he said into thy hands I commend my spirit but his soul went to hell for you and I brother R said he sent his soul back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come and live in every being in the world by the new birth they will accept it so what is a soul give you a quote where brother R said it's the mind of Christ in you what about your soul see David didn't cry out my spirit longth after thee m he said my soul Jesus said my soul is troubled what about it what is a soul come on Brothers sorry about taking too much time this morning I'm not nearly 12 now but see I just want you to realize one thing salvation is not in your body it is not in your spirit you can be anointed every day of your life and die and go to hell salvation of the soul is eternal life amen a Redemptive plan I hope you caught that that even that fifth seal Jew's got to have a Redemptive plan it is the blood of Jesus Christ but not applied to them to bring them to a new birth right even the 144,000 don't come to a right Born Again believer in the body of Christ but they get eternal life right that F sealed Jew will get eternal life no wonder Paul was so happy when he said all Israel will be saved maybe God just opened his eyes just a little bit and let him see that right close it right back up he blinded them for you and I what I got let's Stand Together 597 in power 597 anybody have to need just a moment before we go I have found his grace is all he supp every need I said and
