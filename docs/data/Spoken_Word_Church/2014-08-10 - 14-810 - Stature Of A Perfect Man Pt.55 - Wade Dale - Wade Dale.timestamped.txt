[0:00] Let's uh
[0:04] start for a minute here and uh
[0:07] we were on the Statue of a perfect man
[0:09] still art
[0:12] like 54 or 55 somewhere in there so
[0:16] I hope it's not boring you but remember
[0:18] you don't go up the statue of a perfect
[0:19] man in a day a week a month or even a
[0:22] year it takes time and you know what
[0:24] God's gracious I said we saw in there
[0:26] where he was long suffering give me he
[0:29] gives man time to repent gives man time
[0:32] to grow up but there's going to come a
[0:34] time though if you read in there there's
[0:36] a time that God don't do that
[0:38] he comes to a point he says I said
[0:40] all right I mean he chives along
[0:42] but he's he's not going he and he's
[0:45] long-suffering right but there is going
[0:47] to come an end to everything it was an
[0:50] end to all things all right so he's
[0:51] going to coming into where he's not
[0:53] going to be so long suffering
[0:56] in this virtues of the Statue of a
[0:59] perfect man
[1:00] so we've come down to brotherly kindness
[1:02] we've been talking about brotherly
[1:03] kindness
[1:04] really kindness is one of the hardest
[1:06] ones it's one of the most complex ones
[1:09] because you can say well you got to be
[1:12] so nice to your brother and then you got
[1:14] to look over here and see where Jesus
[1:15] drove the people out of the temple where
[1:17] brother Branham would be sweet and
[1:20] humbled or certain and then he would
[1:22] call him just like Jesus did Snakes in
[1:24] the Grass vipers and all those things so
[1:26] there's a fine line in there that you
[1:29] know and don't get me wrong but
[1:33] let's just put it this way I can't take
[1:35] somebody that's got this meat
[1:39] lowly everybody you know you see
[1:41] preachers they walk up and they go oh
[1:42] bless your heart you know it's like a
[1:43] condo priest I don't be that way I don't
[1:46] believe Peter was that way I don't
[1:47] believe Paul was that way I don't
[1:48] believe James is that way I don't
[1:49] believe John was that way and I sure
[1:51] don't believe Jesus was that way you
[1:53] didn't never hear him
[1:56] um
[2:03] well I told you what I do next time I go
[2:05] you need to slow down then if you don't
[2:06] think you're the one that's supposed to
[2:07] be Christian right
[2:10] what to put you there for
[2:13] all men go up here one day and go well
[2:14] you know I think Barnabas ought to be
[2:16] preaching this sermon today and all he
[2:18] got up there and he said I speak this
[2:20] with boldness right I speak this with
[2:22] assurance
[2:23] and uh and I you know everybody I was
[2:26] thinking about it last night talking
[2:28] about the thing about brotherly kindness
[2:29] I thought well you know some people
[2:33] think that uh
[2:35] you know they quote that scripture that
[2:37] quote the quote where brother Brown says
[2:39] I'd rather be wrong in my doctor and
[2:41] write my spirit and then write my you
[2:43] know Doctrine wrong in my spirit well
[2:45] that's okay but but if you're riding
[2:49] both exactly
[2:50] what if you're writing both Paul was
[2:52] writing both in there you know I mean I
[2:54] believe people
[2:56] hated Paul
[2:59] they killed him didn't they they hated
[3:01] Jesus
[3:02] they killed him didn't they that's right
[3:04] hey and that's what I was thinking I
[3:07] thought well Lord if
[3:08] if everybody loves you it's like that
[3:11] always said and I agree if everybody
[3:13] loves you and everybody is in love with
[3:15] you and everybody thinks you're the
[3:17] greatest you're a hypocrite right right
[3:21] and that's like these preachers in the
[3:23] message I you know I was looking at them
[3:25] the you see some that'll preach anything
[3:27] just to compromise so they can go get In
[3:30] a Pulpit somewhere right well then then
[3:33] most of your popular preachers are are
[3:35] the ones that are kind of off a little
[3:36] bit in their Doctrine because they can
[3:37] go preach the same thing hear the same
[3:39] thing here
[3:40] but you know what about Paul brother
[3:42] Brown brother Brown come up to the end
[3:44] of his ministry and this man was
[3:47] preaching before tens of hundreds of
[3:49] thousands of people and then he was in a
[3:51] room about the size of this with about
[3:52] 20 something people when he preached one
[3:54] of the greatest messages he ever
[3:55] preached and that was a token a Rapture
[3:57] message and a token message out in out
[4:00] in Arizona so
[4:02] you know where is it if you're popular
[4:05] then
[4:07] I kind of question what's going on in
[4:09] your you know in your uh that's it your
[4:12] ministry or in your life if you're just
[4:13] a popular person I I
[4:17] and like I told I was telling a preacher
[4:21] the same one that said he didn't want
[4:22] people to nobody believed I talked to
[4:25] him the thing Friday night
[4:29] but it's just like this you remember the
[4:31] great uh the great thing we did on the
[4:34] Daniel 70-week series you know we did
[4:36] that and we did it to the minute for the
[4:37] minister
[4:38] we weren't at the last ministers meeting
[4:40] in the last ministers meeting they got
[4:41] discussing it
[4:44] and he said well he said we went on and
[4:46] and decided it was three and a half
[4:48] years
[4:49] you weren't there so we decided it was
[4:51] three and a half years yeah I looked at
[4:53] brother and I said you're still wrong
[4:56] I don't care whether I'm there or not
[4:57] right you're still wrong what's that
[4:59] matter
[5:01] they're making a difference
[5:03] but you think well that brother don't
[5:04] have brotherly kindness are you talking
[5:06] about me well
[5:07] maybe everybody needs a little
[5:08] correction every once in a while I'm
[5:10] trying to get people to get out of that
[5:11] old thing that brother Brown was wrong
[5:13] here and right here and right didn't get
[5:15] this right but he got this right that's
[5:17] not true people that's a spirit right
[5:19] that's a spirit that I'm against so bad
[5:21] and the preachers of this message don't
[5:23] see that they don't see that and that's
[5:26] the problem
[5:27] I think brother Brandon preached sternly
[5:29] because the brotherly kindness he he
[5:31] wanted those people to change their ways
[5:33] and accept truth and be safe right well
[5:36] that's what she is around here she's
[5:37] right here it says we read it before my
[5:40] brother sinned against me shall I
[5:41] forgive him 70 times seven now watch him
[5:43] he said somebody said not long ago how
[5:44] can you believe these things you do and
[5:46] still go to assembly God one is all the
[5:48] rest
[5:48] then put zebra over the kindness hoping
[5:51] someday patience with him see Temperance
[5:53] with him but now remember
[5:54] brother Brown will never compromised
[5:56] with them right
[5:59] he never compromised with their doctor
[6:01] when he preached his Doctrine he
[6:03] preached his Doctrine he didn't back up
[6:05] one iota that's right but he was trying
[6:07] like sister Trudy is he was she he was
[6:10] trying to get them to see that something
[6:11] has covered their eyes and that they're
[6:14] in a deception there is that it wasn't
[6:16] and true brotherly kindness is something
[6:18] that we've got to have
[6:19] love for the brother and I have love for
[6:22] all those Brothers
[6:24] but to come to a point in time to where
[6:27] right right wrong wrong
[6:30] and in this message two people can't be
[6:32] right and have two different doctrines
[6:34] right that's what I was thinking about
[6:36] this morning brother Brandon didn't have
[6:37] 17 different doctrines
[6:40] he had one Doctrine
[6:42] and it was the truth and if we preach
[6:44] that truth then our Doctrine is right
[6:47] but it's like it's like said you know
[6:49] you you got two opinions either one's
[6:51] right and one's wrong
[6:53] or either both wrong but you both can't
[6:55] be right so
[6:56] you know there's the contention in the
[6:58] church today but I I told Brother Quinn
[7:01] last night we were talking about a
[7:02] little bit and it kind of It kind of
[7:03] took him back a little bit something
[7:04] there but I said look one word got us
[7:07] out of the garden
[7:08] being one word off is not going to get
[7:10] us back in that's right
[7:12] now brother Raymond said Daddy south
[7:14] that's it one word just one word got us
[7:17] out of the garden so being off you say
[7:19] well this ain't important but you know
[7:20] damn same ways this ain't it's all
[7:22] important yeah right if you don't have
[7:24] it all lined up I promise you one thing
[7:26] The Headstone will not come down on a
[7:28] piece of stone that's turned a different
[7:30] ways than the rest of them
[7:33] okay that's right it won't fit brother
[7:35] Brown will not read it today but we'll
[7:37] read it next week he talks about the
[7:39] honing
[7:40] but what does that do
[7:44] when you got a piece of something it
[7:46] won't fit
[7:47] what do you do
[7:48] you take a piece of sandpaper and oh man
[7:50] it hurts if that was your flesh you'd
[7:53] really hurt
[7:54] but that's what we're talking about this
[7:56] is not a stone that we're building we're
[7:57] building a stature a flesh so you have
[8:01] to take that little rubbing that little
[8:03] rubbing compound and you got to rub it
[8:05] to where that Cap's going to fit down on
[8:06] there because if there's a burr sticking
[8:08] out anybody knows even shooting guns and
[8:11] stuff that if there's a burr one little
[8:13] bird that you can't see with your with
[8:15] your normal life one bird is in that
[8:17] Barrel
[8:18] it can affect
[8:20] that bullet
[8:22] one bird not the whole thing just one
[8:25] little bird that's why you have to keep
[8:26] your Barrel cleaned and all that stuff
[8:28] that's my brother round was talking
[8:29] about keeping our Barrel clean you got
[8:31] to keep everything clean but there is a
[8:33] truth I don't think Paul has a true
[8:37] right Paul had me trip right and Paul
[8:40] comes up and says you'll be judged by my
[8:41] gospel
[8:43] and people hated him for it I'm sure but
[8:45] you know what there was a group of
[8:46] people that believed this gospel and
[8:48] went in
[8:50] and so there's a people that believes
[8:52] the prophet's message and they're going
[8:54] to go in not that brother Branham had a
[8:57] message
[8:58] right
[9:01] that's what they're saying
[9:03] I'm seeing in the message world that
[9:05] they think brother Brown just brought a
[9:06] message
[9:09] no he brought the message
[9:11] if you're an unadulterated and if you
[9:13] get out of that then that don't make me
[9:15] no person bigger than you but if you're
[9:18] wrong you're wrong
[9:21] like I was talking about Abram and
[9:22] Abraham I hope you understood that Abram
[9:24] was okay but Abram was not the promise
[9:27] Abram did we're not the we're not the
[9:30] Abram was not the father of our faith
[9:33] Abraham was the father of our faith so
[9:36] but we have to move through the Abram
[9:38] part to get to the Abraham Park all
[9:42] right so and it's okay to be Abram
[9:44] because Abram got a promise Abram was my
[9:47] father Abram got the things that he was
[9:49] supposed to get but there was a promise
[9:51] of a son being born not to Abram but to
[9:53] Abraham
[9:54] and not to Sarah which was a contentious
[9:57] woman
[9:58] but she moved up into being a princess
[10:00] and then what happened
[10:02] God brought the problems right same way
[10:05] with brotherly kindness brotherly
[10:06] kindness is not being a meat mild kind
[10:10] of Little Priest I'm sorry that's just
[10:12] the way I do not see brotherly kindness
[10:14] is that right
[10:15] I don't see that
[10:17] I believe in being bold
[10:19] I believe in being resolved or resilient
[10:22] in what you believe and if somebody can
[10:25] knock you off of it
[10:27] you didn't have it to start with right
[10:30] whether you're a doctor I mean whether
[10:32] your attitude is right or wrong
[10:34] Paul didn't worry about it that day when
[10:36] he come up and he said if an angel from
[10:37] heaven come and preach any other gospel
[10:39] besides what you heard from me let him
[10:42] be a curse now when can we say that
[10:44] that's right
[10:46] when can we say that
[10:48] you saw you're being boastful no I'm
[10:50] quoting scripture I'm quoting what Paul
[10:53] said there was a man walked on this
[10:55] Earth named Paul that didn't have the
[10:57] Revelation you have if the seals have
[10:59] been revealed to you they weren't
[11:00] revealed to Paul
[11:03] if you had the seals revealed to you not
[11:05] just that you read the books a lot of
[11:06] people think well the seals program
[11:08] brought the seals and we read the book
[11:10] that's right I'm not kidding you there's
[11:12] a lot of people say well brother Brown
[11:13] brought to seals and we were at the book
[11:15] and we got it no you ain't
[11:17] I can just look at you in the face and
[11:19] tell you no you ain't not unless you got
[11:21] a revelation right of what he said all
[11:23] right because most people take the seals
[11:25] as being destruction and all these
[11:27] things I thought it was for a Redemption
[11:29] right I thought it was justification
[11:31] sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost I
[11:33] thought it was for the Redemption of
[11:35] this body
[11:41] well no well most people don't have a
[11:44] revelation they have a revelation that
[11:45] like Daddy said they have a revelation
[11:47] that brother Randall had a revelation
[11:49] secondhand Revelations don't get you
[11:51] anywhere
[11:53] you know what a second-hand Revelation
[11:54] to do read Acts 19.
[11:59] that was once that was one man that had
[12:01] seven sons
[12:03] of skeva
[12:05] Paul we know Jesus we know but you guys
[12:08] we don't know because they endured that
[12:11] demon in the name of Paul
[12:13] right or in the name of Jesus then Paul
[12:16] preached that's right that's a second
[12:18] hand Revelation now what happened to the
[12:20] seven sons of Cuba that devil jumped on
[12:23] them because they didn't have nothing
[12:25] strong enough to counteract that in
[12:27] other words they should have walked up
[12:28] said in the name of Jesus Christ did I
[12:30] preach right or that I have
[12:33] come out of her but no that devil says
[12:35] hey I don't know you
[12:37] I know Jesus and I know Paul you I've
[12:39] never heard of
[12:41] why because it's a secondhand Revolution
[12:43] brother
[12:51] any Brian didn't he say you know they
[12:55] could feel alive
[13:00] that's right that's right
[13:03] problem with the problem with all of us
[13:05] is that we look at this and there is a
[13:07] balance to everything but when you come
[13:09] to brotherly kindness
[13:11] it's not a when it says brotherly
[13:14] kindness or brotherly love
[13:18] God loved those
[13:21] I was trying to get this right the other
[13:23] day so it doesn't sound so bad God loved
[13:26] those
[13:27] um Philistine children so much
[13:31] till he told David to go kill them all
[13:35] now a God that says Thou shalt not kill
[13:37] because somebody asked me that question
[13:38] I was down there was a guy um that was
[13:42] putting some lime out on our food plots
[13:44] this weekend or actually Thursday and I
[13:46] went down there to uh or Friday and I
[13:49] went down there with him and we are
[13:51] talking about religion a little bit and
[13:52] he said well now what
[13:53] how can God say thou shalt not kill
[13:55] anything commandment
[13:57] and then him walk up and or then him
[13:59] come to David come to all the kings and
[14:02] say wipe them all out women children
[14:05] animals not just the men
[14:08] I said well I said to me that shows the
[14:10] love of God
[14:11] and you know you kind of look people
[14:13] look at you like the love of God to kill
[14:15] them all I said yeah them little bitty
[14:16] babies
[14:18] are going to be in heaven but if they
[14:19] had grown up they'd have been big
[14:21] Philistines and they would have been
[14:22] against Israel same way with the
[14:24] amorites and all those people God was
[14:26] doing them a favor
[14:28] same thing with down through the Dark
[14:30] Ages
[14:31] God
[14:33] allowed that to happen sure for example
[14:36] but those people they gave their life
[14:39] for what they believed
[14:41] and they have a portion of Heaven
[14:43] waiting for her
[14:45] so what
[14:46] so what part I mean why don't we just
[14:48] sit here and go well well God shouldn't
[14:50] have done that well they're in heaven
[14:52] what does it matter
[14:54] what what is it us to go well he
[14:56] shouldn't have killed this one and he
[14:58] should have killed him
[14:59] God knows which ones are going which
[15:01] ones are not that's right
[15:03] and Saul got in trouble remember when
[15:05] Samuel told him said Saul kill
[15:08] everything in that City
[15:10] Saul took he saved kings in the lowing
[15:14] of the sheep and the bellowing of the
[15:16] cattle and Saul kept a little bit for
[15:19] himself
[15:20] he didn't do what God Said Samuel walks
[15:23] in now what about a prophet now this is
[15:25] a real nice kind brotherly kindness
[15:26] prophet Samuel walks in and cuts the
[15:28] head off of those remember he brings the
[15:32] kings in he said Saul you were supposed
[15:35] to kill them all he took Saul's sword
[15:37] and cut the heads off of those two
[15:40] candies
[15:42] what a nice Prophet but but you know
[15:46] what God told him to do that
[15:48] and if he didn't do it then he was that
[15:51] meant so much to God though that Saul
[15:53] remember this the Kingdom right then
[15:55] Samuel said Saul the kingdom will no
[15:57] more be yours you disobeyed God you're
[16:00] you're you're a spiritual man listen
[16:02] you're a spiritual man
[16:04] you're a prophet you're anointed but you
[16:07] will not be king anymore you will not be
[16:09] successful anymore
[16:11] now remember Saul's going to be there
[16:14] right right it's always going to be
[16:16] there
[16:17] buddy the kingdom was rent from Saul
[16:20] because what Saul didn't do what we
[16:23] would think would not be brotherly
[16:24] kindness to where you'd go out and kill
[16:26] the whole group of people
[16:28] but I explained to them to the man I
[16:30] said look you got to see the Providence
[16:32] from God
[16:34] I had rather like Hezekiah
[16:37] if today's my day I'd rather go along
[16:39] and be right with God
[16:42] than to be 15 more years and then just
[16:44] mess everything up and and be wrong with
[16:47] God
[16:48] so God knows the time and once he
[16:50] decides that that's it then we ought to
[16:52] say that's it
[16:54] oh
[16:55] we don't hold life and death in our hand
[16:58] we surely don't hold the future so God
[17:00] does so to see brotherly kindness
[17:04] deceive brotherly kindness is not the
[17:07] lovey-dovey attitude that most people
[17:09] think really kind of said when you come
[17:10] to brotherly kindness you shouldn't
[17:11] speak harsh to nobody now that's not
[17:13] what brother Brown said
[17:15] and that's not what the Bible said
[17:17] sure there's ways to get you know
[17:19] there's ways to do things but still
[17:24] Jesus wasn't too
[17:26] uh let's just put a scene here and then
[17:28] I'll always answer that's a question
[17:30] let's put a scene here Jesus walks in
[17:32] the temple one day
[17:34] it's not very popular to start with
[17:37] he walks in the temple one day and he
[17:38] hears the high priest I mean the dude
[17:40] the spokes to have the goods as brother
[17:43] Tom Fall both you say the guy the guy
[17:45] that you're supposed to look up to the
[17:48] guy that's supposed to be your mediator
[17:50] to God he's standing there preaching
[17:54] all right what's the invasion at today
[17:56] he's standing there preaching
[17:59] here come Jesus walking in sits down in
[18:01] the back row
[18:03] remember he don't sit on the front he
[18:05] said from the back row because God will
[18:07] put him on the front row
[18:10] so when the preacher gets finished Jesus
[18:12] stands up you think Church order was out
[18:15] but he stands up and he says
[18:18] you Generation of Vipers
[18:21] you bunch of Snakes in the Grass
[18:24] Hypocrites he called them I mean he goes
[18:27] through a dissertation one time and he
[18:29] goes hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite in
[18:31] the Bible
[18:32] so
[18:34] does that your brotherly kindness yeah
[18:35] she was brotherly kind
[18:37] correct that's correction of Brotherly
[18:39] kindness all right and if we don't take
[18:41] it we're bastard children anyway so he's
[18:43] he knew they were of their father now
[18:45] what about somebody standing up now he
[18:46] they knew what he was talking about
[18:48] he said my father and your father is not
[18:50] the same person
[18:52] and being spiritual they knew what he
[18:54] was talking about that's what made him
[18:55] mad because he said in other words
[18:57] if I'm with the son of God
[18:59] and my daddy ain't the same as yours
[19:03] it don't take a lot of you don't have to
[19:05] draw a picture on a wall
[19:06] to uh to get that point across but
[19:09] that's what Jesus said he said my dad is
[19:10] not your day yeah
[19:12] now buddy that hurt if somebody walks in
[19:14] and told the preacher in a message said
[19:15] look your daddy and my daddy
[19:19] that's your brother no question I was
[19:21] just gonna say brother said what
[19:22] happened to the Jews the Holocaust with
[19:24] the defender mercies that Jehovah sure
[19:25] absolutely we know what it done
[19:28] those people listen to me those people
[19:32] were not saved
[19:36] they were Jews
[19:38] there's no salvation in that at all
[19:41] but because God blinded the eyes of
[19:45] their ancestors
[19:47] right right God blinded the eyes of
[19:51] their ancestors
[19:53] so that the Gentiles could come in he
[19:56] said that's why that you know you look
[19:57] at the in the seals there's the fifth
[19:59] seal right there that's an example
[20:00] there's your fifth cell Jew
[20:03] that Jew never what they don't even
[20:07] think Jesus Christ was the son of God I
[20:09] think I just think it was just a good
[20:10] person
[20:11] right right good profit or something
[20:15] deny he was the son of God but yet those
[20:17] people because they said we are Jews we
[20:21] are God's people
[20:23] God's gonna give him eternal life
[20:25] there's your field Shield you there's
[20:27] your white rose
[20:28] right given to them who to avenge our
[20:31] blood brother Ryan said that can't be a
[20:33] born-again believer
[20:35] because we don't cry out for Avengers we
[20:37] cry out for Mercy for the person
[20:39] right so that's where the mystery in
[20:41] that fifth seal is is Grace look at the
[20:44] grace of that fifth seal that's the best
[20:45] great the biggest
[20:47] to me that's the best showing of Grace
[20:48] there is to take a person who don't even
[20:50] care about God
[20:51] really because they said Jesus is not
[20:54] God they're waiting on the Messiah to
[20:55] come
[20:56] and God's going to give me eternal life
[20:58] for their stand
[21:00] of them being Jews and God having the
[21:03] respect for that
[21:05] because remember when they said let his
[21:07] blood be on us and our children well
[21:09] there's your children standing there
[21:10] when they were standing in front of
[21:12] Jesus
[21:13] and and the pilot said I don't find no
[21:18] fault for this man and the Jews cried
[21:21] out let his blood be on us and our
[21:23] children well they were prophesying that
[21:25] that's going to happen and look what
[21:26] happened to the Jews from them forward
[21:28] man it's just been a dispersed group of
[21:30] people they've been shot out they've
[21:31] been people from been trying to kill
[21:33] them for thousands of years
[21:35] but they're not going to because they
[21:37] were the original bride of Christ they
[21:39] were the original
[21:41] right they were the original they were
[21:43] God's children they haven't left from
[21:45] being God's children because once you're
[21:46] going to college you can't be
[21:48] can't do away with it right but they
[21:51] were blinded by God so that me and you
[21:54] could come in well in blinding them God
[21:57] give Grace to that group of people the
[22:00] Holocaust used the six and a half
[22:01] Millions Jews that were killed now I
[22:04] don't know that all of them
[22:06] but the greater portion of them will be
[22:09] so that's your fifth sealed Jew how long
[22:12] how long to avenge our blood what's he
[22:14] doing they're crying from the that
[22:16] Dimension they're crying out to the ones
[22:18] that are alive now to abandon the blood
[22:21] of those people well see that's not
[22:23] that's not a Christian so brother around
[22:25] near right then that wasn't the critical
[22:27] seat he is calling Christian
[22:28] but it's not Christians under the altar
[22:30] crying how long to avenge our blood
[22:32] that's your fifth sealed Jew because
[22:34] remember that Jew is still wanting
[22:37] something to avenge something
[22:40] you know how long how long good beans
[22:42] our blood well
[22:44] he's waiting on they're waiting on us to
[22:45] get out of here so that the 144 000
[22:48] they're representative here
[22:50] can be killed as they were reading
[22:53] scripture
[22:54] be killed as they were
[22:56] and then they all going to rapture
[22:59] okay and then official Jew is going to
[23:01] come back here in the Millennium and and
[23:03] what a great thing I've always said then
[23:07] they don't know anything about salvation
[23:09] but boy they're going to get up they're
[23:11] going to get an absolute teaching for a
[23:13] thousand years from a group of people
[23:15] that did get salvation
[23:17] you're gonna be able to walk them in
[23:19] that Temple and say look this first
[23:20] court was justification yeah because see
[23:23] they know about the they know about all
[23:24] that they know about justifications they
[23:26] don't know about justification but they
[23:27] know about the outer Court the inner
[23:29] Court the holy holies because remember
[23:30] Jews and Jews they're waiting for God to
[23:32] come into that holy of holies in that
[23:34] physical Temple and show themselves
[23:36] that's why they're waiting for the
[23:38] Messiah to come right
[23:40] but once we get to Glory
[23:43] and their mind is opened up you know not
[23:46] from all the hatred I mean from I get
[23:48] all the hatred out of the way and then
[23:50] us to go into Millennium and the Jews
[23:52] build the temple and then we're able to
[23:53] sit there and say look this is the real
[23:55] Temple that he was talking about
[23:58] we made it because of
[24:00] that blood of that man that you said let
[24:02] his blood be on us and our children we
[24:04] made it and God blinded your eyes
[24:06] so that you couldn't see me
[24:08] I mean you can't see Jesus and then now
[24:10] Jesus came and got us and now we're
[24:12] turning around telling you about him so
[24:14] that's what we're going to do for a
[24:15] thousand years we're not going to sit
[24:16] around and do nothing
[24:17] no I'm
[24:19] praying Lord okay we're not gonna sit
[24:21] around and do anything we're going to
[24:23] say we're going to talk and we're gonna
[24:25] talk about these people but let's get
[24:26] back to brother Connor so brother the
[24:28] kindness watch
[24:31] now he goes through about a doctrine of
[24:33] the of the pyramids which we won't read
[24:35] that it's about the dollar bill
[24:37] I'm about to serpent on a pole
[24:41] and then remember the pyramid
[24:44] the pyramid doesn't have a top on it the
[24:47] real pyramid is is stopped right here
[24:50] right overseas but the pyramid's not
[24:52] there's not a cap or a cop on it okay
[24:56] because he was rejected because remember
[25:01] the Cornerstone
[25:02] to take this Cornerstone it fits right
[25:04] here
[25:07] anybody see that
[25:08] you take the Cornerstone right here the
[25:12] Cornerstone fits just like that in an
[25:13] angle well that's just a little bitty
[25:15] pyramid yeah top up here okay so there's
[25:19] the Cornerstone so the corner has now
[25:21] been made the head but he had to start
[25:22] down here at fade corner and face what's
[25:24] going to put it up here okay
[25:27] and this and this is a little pyramid in
[25:30] itself
[25:31] right this is the full pyramid but this
[25:35] is a pyramid in itself because
[25:36] everything culminates right here
[25:39] everybody see that you got it yeah
[25:42] but you understand about that you see
[25:44] right here it'll probably see or not but
[25:45] this Cornerstone
[25:47] this Cornerstone when they built it it's
[25:49] corn it's a corner and what does it look
[25:51] just like
[25:52] okay right there
[25:55] the foundation of Apostles and Prophets
[25:57] Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone
[26:00] right because he wants to grow up in you
[26:03] Jesus is all this he don't need these he
[26:05] is that
[26:06] we're the ones that need it right
[26:08] he is all this he doesn't need to
[26:12] he doesn't need the Cornerstone because
[26:14] he is the Cornerstone
[26:16] he don't need the headstone cause that's
[26:18] what he is but you and I need to start a
[26:20] faith down here at the foundation
[26:22] because remember this pyramid is not a
[26:25] three-sided pyramid it's a four-sided
[26:26] pyramid
[26:32] so that Pyramid has four sides not three
[26:35] yeah four sides so
[26:38] you got a corner over here corner over
[26:40] here corner here and corner here every
[26:42] one of those stones you can take them
[26:43] out and put them in the other corner and
[26:45] they'll fit
[26:47] isn't it wonderful
[26:49] they all fit
[26:50] and the and the Cornerstone
[26:53] becomes
[26:54] the head because you can't if you're
[26:56] down here and you don't have the
[26:58] foundation there's no way you can build
[27:00] this
[27:01] there's no way you can put that down on
[27:02] top of that you ever got that
[27:06] kind of good when you when you listen
[27:08] get a little teaching it helps you when
[27:12] you well when you say cheese Cornerstone
[27:14] everybody goes what's he talking about
[27:15] well right there there's your Chief
[27:17] Cornerstone right there that corner that
[27:20] pyramid right there becomes
[27:23] this whole thing
[27:25] yep all right so
[27:29] the Cornerstone is I mean the bottom
[27:31] Cornerstone always start his face
[27:33] so faith is a revelation that's right
[27:35] revelation of the word God and God is
[27:38] that Divine love so that all is kind of
[27:41] like well it all comes from here that's
[27:43] why I told you I don't like those lines
[27:45] but those lines are for reference points
[27:47] everybody understand that those lines
[27:49] going this way are for reference points
[27:51] because you don't get you would think
[27:52] that would be like a tank
[27:55] and you fill it up to Virtue and then
[27:57] well that's all you get and you can't
[27:58] get it because of the lines there no no
[28:00] I wish it was done away with and they
[28:03] were just like Freda said I just wish
[28:05] they were kind of words all in here
[28:07] godliness has to start down here and go
[28:09] all the way up
[28:11] but there is a time where brother
[28:12] Branham now
[28:14] somewhere I had it in here where he said
[28:18] Peter gave us the way the road so it's a
[28:22] road map so it's a road map to know that
[28:24] when you got virtue the next thing you
[28:26] need to work on is knowledge
[28:29] okay not just that I'm going to get all
[28:32] the virtue I need and then like I said
[28:33] my Tank's full of virtue and then I'm
[28:35] gonna switch over to my tank of
[28:38] knowledge and fill it up no it just it's
[28:40] all like I said this this Cornerstone is
[28:42] the head
[28:45] so it just fills every bit of this up
[28:47] listen when God birthed you into the
[28:50] body
[28:51] he gave you divine love
[28:56] the new birth is the Divine love of God
[28:59] it's the very soul of God you got that
[29:01] so when you get the new bird you get
[29:05] Divine love but you only get it in a
[29:07] very small portion
[29:09] in other words listen you don't know how
[29:11] to handle it and I got to get out of
[29:13] here because I got to hook up a plan up
[29:15] you don't know how to handle God
[29:17] listen
[29:18] we're babies babies don't know how to
[29:21] handle
[29:22] mature things right right but we are
[29:25] a son and daughter have died right now
[29:28] here with Divine love which is
[29:31] Jesus Christ
[29:32] but we have it in a baby form then we
[29:35] have to say Okay God help me with virtue
[29:37] help me with knowledge help me with
[29:39] temperatures help me patience okay all
[29:40] right we didn't get any word today I'm
[29:42] sorry but maybe we did help a little bit
[29:43] and
[29:46] um next let's see uh we're going to be
[29:49] gone the 31st so
[29:54] 31st of August you got it
[29:57] Day weekend
[29:59] if not you need to talk a crime or else
[30:01] no okay we'll figure it out okay all
[30:03] right Lord bless you
