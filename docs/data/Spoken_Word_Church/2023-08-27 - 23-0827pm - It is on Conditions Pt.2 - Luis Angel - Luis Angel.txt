the light of his glory and grace [Music] it's a pleasure to be here with you once again you know that the plans of God are perfect I did I didn't know you didn't know but he knows it all so his plans never fail and one day he put in my path the pastor and so we're here so it's the plans of God I was talking to some of you familiar in Peru a sister said that she had some family from Peru the connections of God are perfect who had the opportunity to see brother Brown's Ministry last connection connections of God are perfect God is let's go to the scriptures let's continue with this message titled uh unconditioned John 14 21. these are half my Commandments he's that he's he that loved meyama and he that love with me padre shall be loved of my father and I will love him and we'll manifest myself to him amen let us pray loving father we thank you once again or your presence [Music] you are truly letting us letting us know that you are present and Lord help us truly your word can bring us to a point Lord you'll be the one to be praised all the praise be to you Lord father guide us guide us Heavenly Father help us Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you brothers and sisters you may you may be seated glorious thank you by the way I was speaking to the pastor and and to some of the Brethren come on how I came to the message you know I was very young when I came to the message very young when I came to the message I met I I I came to the message from Brother Branham himself and don't be scared I used to work part-time at a radio station and they allowed a uh a time slot for to be able to put brother Brown's messages and I didn't know who that was nobody wanted to do that job so I accepted to do that job to put the tapes and let him play for about an hour and then I would take the tape and give way to the rest of the other programming and for many months I was listening to brother Brandon preaching message after message until God touched my heart and then I believed it is and from then already have I haven't left is perfect Brethren it's a perfect message the people fail Peru but the message is perfect because it comes from God I don't know I know some say well it sounds fanatical no senores no it doesn't if you really know the word of God I know the word of God is this message this message is correct it's correct not only am I telling you this just by mouth or word only but the word agrees with that message but you see the people that criticize they only touch certain things only certain quotes remember he said that yeah man you've heard the tape he said don't think on those things don't even listen don't even listen stop to listen to that and that's correct we do not have to uh keep entertaining those things that don't edify us sometimes I have made mistakes preaching the weight has done the same as well but it's In the Heat of the Moment but when you know the scriptures yourself you are called to to to to know the scriptures you can see that there was a mistake but it's there's no problem we're not preaching Mormon Doctrine maybe we we might we might make a mistake on a word on in a Bible [Music] some people say well look brother Brandman did speak about polygamy but if you read the whole message it's not that way right right the ones that have heard or that have read not every month it shouldn't be difficult brother Jesus when Jesus says when Jesus said if you drink my blood and eat my flesh look look at that situation you're a vampire it is you're a cannibal yeah Loco he's crazy the son of the carpenter The Carpenter's son is crazy and I say I told you something's wrong with that man he's not isn't he the son of Mary and of Joseph the ones that had that relationship before they got married now he says he's a vampire and then he's a cannibal yeah he wasn't speaking about that everyone who's judges who's God judges according to their own conditions oh my hmm depending on on what kind of movie you've been watching a boy [Laughter] what series is the year 2023. and truly we're we're not joking it's truly that way one day I was talking to someone an icon in the message let me it sounds like you know let it be okay you understand and I was not talking about that what some are maybe thinking about oh The Beatles yeah and so he was talking about the Beatles and I never told him about I never said anything about it didn't even mention anything to him and maybe it sounds like it I wasn't speaking and talking about that and many of us are that way that we're quick to judge we all have to be filled with God did you hear what brother Brandon said we need to be serious in this hour of course we joke around play around yeah that's no problem as our sister was saying earlier today I saw something more maybe I can't explain speaking of brother Brandon but when he when I saw him doing or those things there was something different there do you believe that that same thing is here the same God that did that with brother Branham he's supposed to do it with each one of us as well he said he said I'm on the platform showing you bride of Christ what you will do you're not going to be William Branham but the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus it's the same spirit in in the unveiling of God do you remember everything that was in God Jesus poured it into Christ everything that was in Christ supported in his church right [Applause] there is coming a day when you recognize that the father is in him and that you are in him that day ask what you will be there and he will do it that is not tomorrow it's today [Music] mismo himself amen so why are we afraid because people are going to criticize they're going to say whatever they want to say but that is his promise the condition that keeps my Commandments that keeps my word and and puts them to work and and keepeth them he is he that loveth me amen amen look what it says okay in John 15 5. we are the branches [Music] the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can't do nothing you have to be in the Fountain of Life separated from that Fountain of Life you can fall and believe anything and create more camps than there is already God helps us is to abide in him to abide in him and let's continue and in verse seven if you abide in me he means and my words abide in you I was listening to someone the other day and he said the following he said what we have to do is have a spiritual revelation of the word okay okay and I said yeah okay I said now how is that going to happen God is gonna buy a cloud just descend every single thing in the word you know just writing inside of you they think that they're iPads [Laughter] [Applause] I'm speaking of terminology that some of you young ones understand this is the Apple Country right you you take a picture with an iPhone yes it's on your iPad at the same time technology pretty much technology but you took a picture with your iPhone but you have to take a picture with your own eyes with your own eyes if you can't read it's cucha then listen yeah they have audio Bibles as well there's no excuse to not know the word amen [Applause] and I was I was listening to a missionary some of you may know him you know sometimes when you're preaching and you might say some things about about your life or your testimony of what the word has done in your life but there are some that when they preach this is they say certain things that we know really what's in their head and there's certain brother said yes he's an older man he said I've never read the word of God totally but I believe it's the truth ministro and a minister and a missionary and he's an elder okay what is a missionary someone that just goes and says Jesus saves someone that would put a foundation someone that would go and put things in order and to be able to do that you have to know the words oh what you're speaking about amen Jesus Christ was dressed in that thoughtful Ministry Jesus did not Jesus knew everything I don't know how it works here but the word is the word the word is the word and so I I I came to this message at a very young day and I've met many muchas many preachers many missionaries here from America yes and I have been a witness Hombres of good man is also Batman of good Witnesses of God and then of people that are not even worthy of the Gospel and bring forth fruit one more time like we said this morning gossip is not the fruit foreign witchcraft is not of the Holy Spirit some of them some some look like the The Witch of Endor es and you've read the word speaking of the spirit the king who's she calling the spirit of he said it clearly he can't touch me until I have fulfilled with everything that God called me to do and you had just read it with me Malachi 4 it's been fulfilled it's history Revelations 10 7 it's been fulfilled it's Historia it's history we should be walking on in the celestial things even even now they didn't have good Christians they were they were they were uh uh make-believers react to the word because we are being witnesses that that is true in our lives I was telling someone the other day I said let me let me can you put on one of those football games that you all watch not me I mean I wanted this I wanted to watch what football here you know I said I'm not going to understand nothing they're going to jump here they're gonna someone will get mad over here and I will I will not react to it because I know nothing about football and the people don't react to the word because they don't know it amen it's simply it's simple you don't have to be a genius to know what people what people are like I I I've maybe have said something about the headstones I may have said something about the spirit of God tabernacling in you I may have said something about the pyramid look at the angles here the angle here and there but they don't understand it no gambian they don't change because they don't know they don't know the word of God because then the pastor might get upset if he does in other places and I'm not talking about here [Laughter] no yes I'm a witness that brother Wade he teaches good word you have a good pasture a good creature there's many people that that just shout yeah they do all kinds of things but they don't have a life that backs up that Shout God has blessed you all great amen praise the Lord now I don't say that to get brownie points I just I've seen that amen the People Are People are watching online [Laughter] all right look here this is and I have uh you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain it has to remain many people live of the experience that they had 20 years ago what about today [Music] every moment or you stopped loving your wife ten years ago you love her every day right so some of you are thinking preparing your muscle your muscle your muzzle they say and that your fruit should remain watch watch what it says that whatsoever he shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you he may give it you one of the reasons why the Israelite wouldn't call upon the name of the Lord I'm not an expert one of the reasons why they don't name the name of God is because for them just to say the name of God it makes him present it makes him present for them that means death because they're sincere they don't feel prepared but Christians sometimes we take the name of the Lord in vain all right and there there's no fear of the Lord and why is there no fear why is it people don't fear because we have many atheists preaching this message they don't believe in God truly but they but they live by that by God those are the ones that take salaries and things like that the brother Brandon would talk about it they just they work for the meal ticket yeah you can say Well it's that doesn't interest you but for other people in the third world countries it's a lot it means a lot to them yeah many people don't think about inflation [Music] would say that he would take a hundred dollars you remember that okay do you remember if you go back in time and if you look at the inflation and you compare it to the the value of the money today [Music] it's it's money that you can live goodbye we're talking about here in the States but you know here it's this it's the states maybe in that day an automobile cost four hundred dollars but look at inflation now the other day a minister was saying Americano an American brother who doesn't read unless yeah he said he lives like the prophet with like a with a hundred dollars and I said uh and I told him I said you live like that first and then we'll see that they're good to speak or say something something catchy amen and there's people that just don't read it correct I'm saying it politically correct yeah [Laughter] all right let's continue all right I want to quote this because it's very important in adoption part four is 1960. and you can see the script the quotes there I'm living the brother Wade and brother Louisa a copy Luis Luis Angel Luis Angel [Laughter] so that you don't confuse us here [Laughter] I mean I'm just it's just not a joke adoption in adoption meaning I want you to understand this the best way possible I know that you all have read that book amen what color is the book now yeah good Rojo Elementary Sovereign this is what he believed he said I want to take this whole book it's the only old book that we that we know this was in 1960. the church age book wasn't even written then it wasn't in print yeah that old book is he's talking about this book his Scofield bible you know that he said I want to take this old book is here it is this old book s it's yours you stand with it [Music] don't you compromise on one word you stay right with it you stay right with it honey this is what brother Brandon said right continua let's continue don't you don't care I don't care who's against you okay who's again okay who's again God will be for you on this book and here it says who has been divorced or has had relations with others with another woman [Laughter] pacified woman just not make it sound strange or weird it's 2023 anything goes those are there as well yes yes I have seen those preachers within the message amen and the people back them up but it's not in the word the Bible says curse it be a man who lays with another man I can't compromise on that yeah not even for an offering many ministers even here that that go around preaching and won't say certain things just so they could get that stuff in North America evangelist from here from from North America don't say certain things don't bring judgment in the house of God it's time to to be serious 60 years we're in 2023 and what are we doing God help us you might be saying this Peruvian man preaches very strange foreign I can talk to you about beautiful things and brother Brown said one time you can be healed many times God can work in your life many times by healing but you you might go to hell healed and that's what we have seen it's the truth so look what it says here Contigo God will be for you you preach every word exactly just the way it's wrote in there and the condition e and papa Daddy see you across the river what is the condition brother every words just as it is in the word foreign that's the desire for all of us this book is still is still that is still uh relevant said that it has become a new book to us it was sealed before but the Seven Seals have been loose and we have to see him now in every page of this word and if you don't see him go back and read again because you have to see him every page of the Bible because he was the word when you look at yourself there that day has to come that day has to come Ephesians 4 11 says it's for the perfecting of the Saints perfecting of the Saints not not to retain the Saints not to make them happy all the time not to entertain the Saints or not just to feed the Saints of the Saints amen [Applause] okay there's got to be an Awakening here yeah it's time to get seriously this is we have believed many times that maybe we have it all already because we have all the books we've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and that you know that God is serpency divorce marriage and divorce maybe another little thing here and there there are many denominations that believe those same things there is a synagogue where the rabbi is a woman is and they also preach Serpentine see yeah so we don't have it all together the only thing that gives you a shirt is that you have been born again you are born again oh you guys you can see that you you feel that I love the word of God you love God if you love God you love his word amen is we want sometimes our young people to stay in church there's nothing that you can do you have to let God do it when God touches them it's God then who transforms who changes them but remember your children are not going to do what you tell them they're going to do what you do tell them to read the Bible and if you don't read the Bible they're not going to do it leonos you both read together then start reading the word together at the beginning it's difficult yes afterwards it becomes a habit it should be a habit just as you like to go eat tortillas come and read the word together it has to be that way tortillas come from Mexico Cinco de Mayo Cinco de Mayo the 5th of May but this came from heaven and when you're transformed this should not be lacking in your life spread it to you the prophet's own words this old book is still relevant today as it always has been but you might say oh everything that's in there has already been fulfilled you are being you are living prophecy being fulfilled right now and that is there is that is there yes let it not be that we disappear just like the ten tribes of Israel remember there's ten tribes that are now no longer or they killed them all they were absorbed by the culture esparcidos of the cities that they were they were they were separated too serious Babylonians Syria Babylon you know all of that is they were absorbed by that culture of those cities many message churches they are being absorbed by this current culture there are many prideful preachers no right oh pride pride preachers not prideful Pride the culture of today christianos there's some trans Christians they're Sinners but they say they're saved adulteros adulterers fornicarios fornicators it's something that's incredible to me God help us if someone touches your child you won't tolerate it right you love your child and if something touches the word I don't like that is I'm not going to tolerate it is I won't tolerate it there's people that I've had to separate from because they don't honor the word and it's God it's the word or nothing right amen we're citizens of the kingdom of God when he said you make a bigger circle look at this just recently I finished preaching a series when he said don't exclude anyone he says the following foreign not necessarily that he's he's a very loving type of person we're not talking about that type of Personality because you know there's there's bad people that treat you good so that they can rob you later that the word of God says who has a wife one wife and and children Iglesia a good church a good pastor where sound Doctrine is preached that's what he says and when you elect that church to go to that church where one is but he didn't say that all of them he said just look for those look for those qualities and where someone chooses a church with those types of conditions he said don't exclude them Doctrine [Music] [Music] make the circle bigger or don't exclude anyone he wasn't saying that foreign that's only in third world countries here maybe in Arizona or in Atlanta or in in in Carolina's in maybe in the Carolinas many places we have to be careful with them so when you read just as it should be when you the way you should read that's written there someone said to me well brother I don't read I listen well when you listen ing you know you have your the tapes and you can hear them yourself all the tapes that you can because at some time at some point when you need it it's going to come it will come and that's what we need to do we need to be prepared so that when Satan comes in on the scene you could say it is written said so you remember that magician there in the book of Acts in the name of Jesus he went to go cast out a demon but the one that cast out was him himself all of that is in the word and so we have to pay attention to those things someone might come yeah and maybe my talk about having balance but how do I know about balance if I don't understand the program I have to know this to come to a balance amen we need to give emphasis to come back to the word come back to the word this is the Fountain of Life when you come to the world you come to God when you come to God he manifests himself in your life simply it's simple one more one more one plus one plus one all of you will respond the same we'll answer the same well someone answered differently in China One Plus One is two as well if you have the Holy Spirit you're going to produce the same fruits they were produced in Jesus Martyrs of the church and you're going to keep producing them today in Sons and Daughters of God a simpler manner it's simple no no more difficult it seems not difficult it's simple amen you have to think now that less is more Simplicity or or let's say the Simplicity brother Brandon preached the message God revealed in simplicity the people make them very difficult is simply but he's simple God help us okay glorious glorious all right quote number three number three glorious okay right here brother Brown says here a recording and remember I'm on record for this and we're Witnesses of that in 1963 look what he says here is and I remember I'm on record for this any promise of God in the Bible it's on conditions now is I don't know what those that are leaving the message say that Brandon never preached the word we're just saying that brother Brandon look what brother Brown says it's there maybe they haven't read themselves yeah every any promise of God in the Bible it's on conditions now just because you believe it's there is some say I believe it's there your Prophet my Prophet says that doesn't make it so this young man there's a condition there bro until now we've seen that there's a condition it's starting ill it's to be in him it's starting in it's to be in him so that this comes speaking of this light so if this turns on so for this to turn on it has to be connected to the power source that will not work you have the mechanics that you need Dynamics right and that's what we need to be doing God help us brother Isaiah 52. this Biblical quote is very important look what it says here locally though they have read know that it's speaking about the end time when brother Branham spoke about Isaiah he said Isaiah was like a small Bible it was like running through the whole Bible you've read what he said when he said that good it's time we went good shall know my name when you call upon the name of the lord it's not only about just saying his name is remember this is written in a way so that you understand the character of what is being spoken of in other words when you when we when we call upon the name of the Lord have you read read uh Revelations 13 8. you know what I'm about about to say Jesus Jesus crucified was crucified I'm just paraphrasing before the foundation of the world you know that yes that was an expression but the materialization of that foreign everything after that is a manifestation there is expression of that expression Jesus told the Fig Tree remember the fig tree that he cursed and it wilted it died elentro Viola he came back and he saw what had happened and he's and he said what he said look what it says here therefore my people shall know my name my name is they'll know what I'm doing at that moment it's just like God taking a picture with you a year yesterday Aki here you understand muchos this happened many many years ago before the foundation of the world in this meeting in the mind of God yes and this is now the materialization of that what he thought of are you understanding I didn't know you didn't know the Aussie in the name of the Lord are you understand many people might say and the ones that preach false Doctrine two or three in the name of the Lord and that's the formula for them to start something um no no they say the Bible says that if two or three are are united in my name or gathered in my name or one Accord remember who are they going to be in one Accord with with the mayor with the president with his word in that day when my word is in you you are in me ask and I shall give it to you the same holy spirit that produced all that was produced in the life of brother Branham we'll produce it in US so we have to start believing that we have to start living that is North Americans might go to a third world country is and they put this uh very notoriously I come from a free country I'm a free person and you know that there's regimes in third world countries [Music] and they feel that they're restricted from their freedom you all can walk freely here or and you can also Express Yourself freely here you can buy offender now you can say if you say something about genders and stuff like that you can get into issues we're supposed to be the land of the free San juenta but you see is that is your character answers that is what you have look at what you know that you are and why not in Christian in Christianity in in God's things why don't we act the same we're the sons of God Satan has no right to to be near me not because the holy spirit is in me or the holy spirit is there is Liberty you have to come to that point amen cancers will fall in brother Brown's Ministries sometimes he didn't even have to pray he just simply those things were just simply fall and Cancers would fall because where the spirit of God is the spirit of God in your past the devil has to flee sometimes you might say well I have to apply a certain Authority in in in in my household for my children better just apply the holy spirit in your life and you'll see things change in your household amen you create the atmosphere you want to have a heaven that your home be a heaven come in come in start acting like a child of God through you amen is so we have to do that what happened 60 years have gone by this is more than a hundred years has passed since Azusa Street and what's happening we are here in the Bible Belt here in America and what's happening we're not giving forth like the the the souls are being lost there's corruption salt is not activated he said we are the salt of the earth he never said we are the sugar of the earth and we have become to be the sugars we're just sweet and we're just loving but he said we're soft and salt prevents corruption God help us because some might come and they'll show you a very loving face if you tell them something they don't like they'll pick you up like that from your collar America two Americans here they did that to me yeah if I say the name you want to give money anymore they watch a lot of wrestling they're not watching the word of God that's not of God that's not of God God is different and why did they get upset maybe you insulted them no or maybe I insulted him now Uno one of them made an exchange of some of some money with a woman who was uh not dressed well and so he was he was upset but he was the one who did that problem or made that problem this wasn't me yeah oh yeah when you're very spiritual mujeres even though the woman is not dressed properly you're looking at the numbers see I hope you understand they're from our people shall know my name uh therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day look what it says here that I am he that does speak behold it is I [Music] how beautiful upon the mountains how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings The Good Tidings the good tidings who are they the kingdom of God is is within you Jesus is it in Jesus but more than that El Espiritu Santo the holy spirit let the Holy Spirit [Music] make that Kingdom or build that Kingdom it would be the kingdom of God I said to to draw near to the people of this world the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus we have to take the testimony of Jesus not only just speak of Jesus the life there was in Jesus someone out there who will have to say God sent you it is it's just as if God has sent you I know it has happened to some of you someone might have said to you that was for me meaning La Paz it says here they bring it to Italians that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publishes salvation for the bride of Christ the prophet said so thy God reigneth one thing is the devil also believes in God but the other thing is to say that he reigns he is the Lord of your life of my life we are we are we are the Servants of Love towards Christ when that happens when our god reigns look what the next verse says thy Watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing [Music] but we all have to come to the same thing remember this is the same stature of Christ those that have fallen back many people looked at him like that and they loved going there and I've received testimonies I would say there was no meetings like those meetings oh he was a good man and he would treat you so good Grande such a great man they put him at a pedestal I and then he comes out leaves the message and you would say I've never learned anything and you had them up in the pedestal when he spoke it sounded he sounded like he was just super anointed they started putting his his sermons online yeah you started speaking many elevated things but nobody's supposed to look to see if he was saying what the prophet was saying and that was what the problem was that was the problem as if we problem that was the issue but when God is on the scene look what it says one more that one more time that part Watchman shall lift up the voice with the voice together foreign for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion there won't be any difference I can see myself the same way and know that he's here know that it's the same word now that he's greater or that I'm greater we're at the same level same word the same word because this is the same measure we all have to come to that God help us let's read one more quote so we can finish up is that the message is I was with Moses so I will be with thee is I'll be with you even in you today end of the way each minister is called to stand where he did each minister is called to stand where he did where was he the same works that I do shall you do also each minister is ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed it should be in US I don't know isn't that what he's saying there is that is that's quite a command it's an order it's not a suggestion it's a command it's what we're supposed to do sonidos no that's only the greater ones in the of the in the U.S every minister every minister Jesus The Works that Christ did not that they go imitating the way uh the the greater ones if he turns here and I'll see who are they imitating I look over there imitating the same person and you can see it I have no idea to know I've I've seen it I I know you have to yeah but you have to imitate the Lord the Lord Paul said uh imitate me no follow me no not him not him follow me in the way that is I follow Christ or to do the same works but they're imitating each other nowadays but the thing of it is they forget who they are that's very important we need to know who we are when you know who you are he said it is when when the day that when the church realizes who she is it will be an invincible Army that's what he says in the church age book that's the condition being born again born again not in fornication not in adultery not in being a feminate yes a that's what the prophet said he called it and he said some other strong things as well there are some that would get offended when you repeat the same things that the prophet said In the Heat of that message he said there's no other better way to say that and it was the truth it was truth taught why are we afraid of that yeah oh they're gonna they're gonna call us out it's biblical it's biblical you just now saw it in Isaiah we're gonna see eye to eye to eye and we're going to say look what it said for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion he didn't say that they're going to go see over there in that corner yeah or over there in that place I have to see the Lord he has to see the Lord I have to see the Lord that way or from Korea China or from China uh Japan Japan no no that has this has nothing to do with our skin color is Jesus I said what color was Jesus's skin Olive has nothing to do with the skin color is the holy spirit it's the spirit of God producing the same works the exact same thing that Jesus did that's what makes it so equal with Jesus Christ in his presence yeah and supresencia oh my yeah oh my makes the devil angry but I mean devils are angry right now brother brother Dale why did you invite that man just let him loose somewhere on the side of the road there's people that get angry there's people that don't like it that you know what's happening in in America or down in South America or wherever to service you know I was going to say the name but better now one time someone gave another Minister a thousand dollars so that they could send us some Bibles and you know what Bibles they sent us the ones that uh that that they give out here and there's ones that they give out here free for free the free ones and that's the ones that they sent us that's the ones that they sent us we could have we could have bought them there but they stayed well we'll just send them from here and they're good quality Americano American but they sent us the ones that they give out freely here this house you see and to me that's shameful foreign but sometimes people are very tight on their money God help us look what it says here is he says oh that's what makes the devil angry foreign who they are that's it Gloria glory to God and in the message this day the scripture is fulfilled and he said the Seven Seals The Hating Mysteries of the entire Bible again Bible you know I don't understand why they say that he never taught the Bible Bible entire Bible entire Revival yeah entire Revival entire Bible will be opened and fulfill Revelation 10. that in the seventh Angel's message these things should come to pass this is in 1965. this day this scripture is fulfilled before our eyes this scripture is fulfilled time is no more time is no more we have to start manifesting Eternal things Eternal things it's time to make a line just as in the days of Moses those that are with the word come here those that don't want to stay with the word the Earth is going to swallow you up culture will swallow you up the culture of our day will swallow you up where there are fornicating preachers adultering preachers preachers who are homosexuals those cultures that will swallow you up God give us strength foreign God help us brothers and sisters in the last few years I have been tried in many different things includes in 2015 I became very illness and they

God you have your faith but please listen to your mother go and see the doctor I went to the clinic and they didn't let me come out because when you have sepsis and if they don't treat you you could sue them and so they told me you either stay by your own will or we're just gonna subject you to the bed tie you up they had to they had to give me antibiotics for five days five days and I don't like needles and so last year in order for me to come to the states one of the things for you to enter the US you had to have four vaccines I said Lord help me four hey so they had me in the hospital five
