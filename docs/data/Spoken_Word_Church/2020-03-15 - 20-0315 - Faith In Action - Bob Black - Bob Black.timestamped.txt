[0:01] good morning everybody
[0:07] to this morning's topic that I hate to
[0:10] talk about is a little topic I just
[0:17] built we're just kind of look at faith
[0:22] in action
[0:23] what so you know a lot of times we will
[0:27] get will come to church and we believe
[0:30] what the preachers say we do now I
[0:31] believe it and and and we hang on to our
[0:34] faith and yet we don't realize that you
[0:36] can actually do something with your face
[0:38] if you'll turn them loose it can
[0:41] accomplish a purpose I mean they can do
[0:43] something with it so I just kind of want
[0:45] to look at that we're supposed to have
[0:48] faith and then put it in action
[0:51] like on remand talk about the cell
[0:53] phones with their wings that were
[0:55] constantly moved and movement that you
[0:57] know wings over their face wings over
[0:58] there
[0:59] there was Emily we have the wings over
[1:00] their feet and the wings that they were
[1:02] in in motion where they were constantly
[1:05] an action movie
[1:07] so in the message puts their faith to
[1:10] work the message God's provided way of
[1:14] healing yes in 1954 program said now
[1:17] when you say you've got frame for divine
[1:19] healing and something strikes you it
[1:21] says to move out that's the confirmation
[1:23] that God has received your faith for
[1:25] divine do that's right when you got
[1:28] courage to put your faith in action but
[1:31] when you say you got faith and afraid to
[1:33] let it go your faith is dead see but
[1:36] when you got faith and willing to let it
[1:38] go then God's confirming it when the
[1:41] sign is following and you'll see your
[1:44] even so when you can let it go now a lot
[1:48] of times letting it go comes in
[1:49] different forms it's you know
[1:51] and you tell somebody if you're sick
[1:54] when you begin to tell some money I
[1:56] believe God's Word and you begin to
[1:59] confess I believe that God is still a
[2:01] healer he's still the same yesterday
[2:03] today and forever or the same thing with
[2:06] new birth I believe that God promised it
[2:08] I believe that God is able to give it to
[2:10] me then you releasing that faith right
[2:13] you're turning in loose don't pain your
[2:15] confection in a way that you act the way
[2:18] that you walk and you're taking taking a
[2:20] hold of God more than just letting it
[2:22] loose confession is is is lining up what
[2:34] you say with what God word says so if
[2:37] God works in your heel speaking fake I
[2:41] believe God word I believe that God said
[2:43] God
[2:44] god I've already paid the price for he
[2:45] paid the price on the cross and there's
[2:48] nothing else for me to do but believe it
[2:51] no no bro Graham said in faith in action
[2:53] and this is really I got to read this
[2:56] message and this is kind of where many
[2:58] wonders came from Burroughs said now
[3:00] faith is not based upon the shifting
[3:02] sands of man's ideas no that's something
[3:05] that kind of maybe maybe would just want
[3:08] to nail down for a second this morning
[3:09] because a lot of times we we can get so
[3:11] caught up in emotions and feelings and
[3:13] things and we look for for God to kind
[3:15] of speak to us in in like a feeling or a
[3:17] sensation or or like or or something
[3:20] that we use that to determine whether or
[3:23] not God has spoken to us or not but the
[3:25] real thing that brother Brandon said
[3:27] that we go back to that you know he says
[3:30] faith has to have a resting place and if
[3:32] we keep reading then he says the only
[3:34] solid resting place for faith is home
[3:36] God's Word so you got to have it but
[3:39] he's talking about you gotta have a
[3:40] prove something to rest your fainting
[3:42] right and that thing let us be honest
[3:45] the devil a lot of times he'll come in
[3:47] he can so easily impersonate sensations
[3:50] and Lysa stuff and that's really one of
[3:52] the dangers was with speaking in tongues
[3:55] and all those kind of things is that's
[3:56] one of the one of the easiest ways for
[3:58] the devil and just swoop in and
[4:00] and impersonate that traveler one thing
[4:02] you cannot impersonate is a revelation
[4:04] of God's work okay so if you go back and
[4:07] take it take it back to God's Word and
[4:09] see what God said about it but then you
[4:11] can rest on that and have something that
[4:14] you can put in action now you get the
[4:16] example if you were going to get married
[4:18] the woman that you'd marry you have to
[4:20] have faith in her she'd have to have
[4:22] faith in you because it can't be based
[4:23] upon something else and you know that's
[4:26] kind of a good example because a lot of
[4:27] times you could get kind of get in your
[4:29] head that the person that you're talking
[4:31] to or whatever is the right person or
[4:33] whatever but you got you got to have it
[4:34] based on something right in other words
[4:37] before before you got married you would
[4:39] want to have confidence in that other
[4:41] person you want to have confidence that
[4:43] they're gonna lead you closer to God and
[4:45] all those kind of things God's Word is a
[4:48] solid rock of eating faith that anybody
[4:50] wants to have in the supernatural that
[4:51] must be placed first in the Word of the
[4:53] Living God now that when men of old and
[4:56] in all ages when they would really find
[4:58] the Word of God they could grasp it
[5:01] faith went into action right away so
[5:05] let's kind of think about what faith is
[5:07] faith is like I just put this image of
[5:10] this locomotive plow through the snow we
[5:12] got all this snow
[5:14] nowheres all like circumstances and then
[5:16] locomotive they don't care about that
[5:17] snow it's just whoa because that's how
[5:21] crazy ISM and I looked at some of the
[5:23] things the way my brother very much
[5:24] explaining faith and he said any no
[5:26] circumstances hey it doesn't look at
[5:29] symptoms and and now now today we've got
[5:32] us a lot of symptoms and the whole work
[5:34] my hope my work has been just a madhouse
[5:36] of everybody going all about the
[5:38] coronavirus and everything and by the
[5:41] symptoms by looking at the things that
[5:43] are happening in China and India and all
[5:45] that comes to a little crew scared
[5:48] the snow might look scared and somebody
[5:50] trying to try to you know go somewhere
[5:52] but please so I don't care about the
[5:55] circumstances when the doctor says you
[5:57] got cancer or the doctor says you got
[5:59] some kind of horrible disease or
[6:01] somebody's a preacher might say well the
[6:03] Holy Ghost is not for you I believe you
[6:04] were born after 1977 or whatever faith
[6:07] says I don't care I'm ignore the
[6:10] circumstances I'm plowing to hear faith
[6:12] ignores what people say cuz you listen
[6:17] as you get older you'll find that that
[6:20] people will say all manner of kind of
[6:22] things faith if you're grounded and
[6:25] rooted in faith faith would they don't
[6:27] care if someone will say oh well if the
[6:31] promises not for you and then we'll put
[6:32] all kind of try to put all kinds of
[6:33] doubts yeah but baby ignores it
[6:36] faith is not a shame I'm going back to
[6:39] what people say you know after you get
[6:42] the new birth the year for your friends
[6:43] might be trying to ridicule you say well
[6:45] what you got is not the real thing or
[6:47] the devil kind of trying to be putting
[6:49] all kind of thoughts in your hand and
[6:51] stuff faith faith is like a big old
[6:53] bromley burly like Arnold Schwarzenegger
[6:56] that rises up just got that big old huge
[6:58] faith must right who cares woody by says
[7:02] the faith has no hinders faith knows
[7:06] where it stands and these are some
[7:09] things that really remember sent by
[7:10] faith faith says shut up and sit down
[7:18] another words when the devil comes along
[7:20] and tries to tell you all kinds of
[7:22] things Ranger says just just sit down
[7:25] ain't got no time for that nonsense
[7:28] faith is burly and runs and sees only
[7:32] victory and that's what faith is faith
[7:35] and and how you get faith you by reading
[7:38] the word by hearing the word by coming
[7:40] to church
[7:40] faith cometh by hearing because what is
[7:44] faith faith is a revelation of the word
[7:46] a revelation of the word will give you
[7:49] this kind of of an attitude towards
[7:53] circumstance
[7:54] and symptoms and all those kind of
[7:56] things when the when the end becomes
[7:58] I've been like a flood then the God will
[8:00] raise up a standard and what is this
[8:02] standard his word a revelation of his
[8:05] word and that is the thing that will
[8:06] defeat the enemy every time yes and the
[8:09] message is shame brother Ram said he
[8:12] said mister God God so look like when
[8:14] you pray for people you apologize mr.
[8:16] devil would you please move over and let
[8:19] me nothing phases got muscles and hair
[8:22] on his chest when it speaks everything
[8:24] else shuts up tell me where mr. devil do
[8:27] you move around get out of here I'm a
[8:30] son of God Commission of God leave him
[8:32] alone that moves you have no apology to
[8:34] the Dylan nothing to do with you I'm not
[8:35] ashamed of the Word of God not ashamed
[8:38] of your Commission not ashamed of who we
[8:41] are but as a servant I'm not ashamed I'm
[8:45] not ashamed of his work that's big old
[8:48] growing faith they could just take out a
[8:51] word and stand on and the message faith
[8:54] come about cometh by hearing brother I'm
[8:56] said now faith don't look at that faith
[8:59] comes around I don't care nothing about
[9:01] conditions God's its own and it's mine
[9:05] you see faith and birth as I once said
[9:08] faith that's here on the gist when it
[9:10] stands up and pulls it's big muscles out
[9:12] everything else vanishes away when faith
[9:16] really takes a whole nothing else stands
[9:19] now what I'm talking about it when you
[9:22] come to church to say I believe that's
[9:24] all good and everything but there's you
[9:27] can turn that faith loose and it will
[9:30] have an impact on your family it will
[9:32] have an impact on your relationship with
[9:34] God on things that maybe you think are
[9:36] impossible
[9:38] you got you got a powerful weapon down
[9:41] on the inside I'm just kind of a burden
[9:43] oi that fire on the inside and if you
[9:46] let that loose it can it can it can it
[9:50] will unleash the power of God yes turn
[9:53] it loose Jamie went to space don't take
[9:56] no for an answer
[9:57] it's got hairs on the chest it's big and
[10:00] burly it speaks and everything else sets
[10:02] down that's all you know you think about
[10:06] that genuine faith don't take no for an
[10:08] answer if you've got God's Word and you
[10:12] come to like for example the new birth
[10:13] the promise of the new birth the
[10:15] promises under you and to your children
[10:17] and right if you come to him and you
[10:19] might think what he's telling me no it
[10:21] doesn't seem like it's happening face
[10:23] does not take no for an answer
[10:26] you got your resting upon the Word of
[10:28] God thank you you know that's what faith
[10:32] really is is we you find something in
[10:34] the Bible and you're like I believe this
[10:36] or you sitting in church and you know
[10:38] that that's that's the truth and then
[10:41] you can come back to God and you lay it
[10:43] at his feet and say you promised it yeah
[10:49] I see you're obligated to keep your word
[10:54] see you said you said shut up faith will
[10:57] set in shut up don't you feel it that's
[11:00] it serious looking at what God said God
[11:03] said so so faith believe it and you can
[11:06] just hold on faith then just let faith
[11:08] take over it makes the rest of them look
[11:11] like little doors it just makes them sit
[11:14] down because he's the boss got great big
[11:17] groaning muscles and I tell you
[11:19] everything else all feelings and
[11:21] superstitions and little isms and things
[11:23] just sets down with faith takes over and
[11:27] what faith takes over you know you know
[11:30] that God is gonna come all the same you
[11:32] know that you've already got your
[11:34] healing even though it might not be
[11:35] manifest in your body and you know that
[11:38] the promise is gonna be given to you
[11:40] because your faith is resting on the
[11:42] Word of God yes both yes see I think
[11:48] maybe just kind of a magnet you got the
[11:51] sword of the word in your hand do you
[11:53] say well do you realize what you are in
[11:56] possession of what's in your hand why
[11:58] it's got writing you he said you're he's
[12:00] talking to somebody deserving in the
[12:02] congregation it's in your heart it's all
[12:05] over you the Holy Ghost do something
[12:07] about it throw it out there and trust
[12:09] God say certainly God promised it to me
[12:12] and I believe he says it and believe
[12:17] from the heart it takes your faith
[12:19] anchored yonder a dog saying God it is
[12:21] the truth there alone my stand and let
[12:25] that just keep in here until it drops
[12:27] down into here from your head to your
[12:29] heart till it becomes a reality then
[12:32] it'll work oh it can it work when it
[12:35] comes to the heart that's right
[12:38] no work it is good work if you just turn
[12:41] it loose it will accomplish his purpose
[12:44] and he said in the fundamental
[12:47] foundation for faith he said now when
[12:48] you throw ourselves completely to God
[12:50] into his
[12:51] and you lost through our own thoughts
[12:53] and just let the mind of Christ being us
[12:55] then same operations of the Spirit would
[12:58] work to us just as the natural things
[13:00] does just the same thing and he said God
[13:04] and His Word is inseparable you cannot
[13:06] have God without having his word and
[13:08] when you have his word you have God yes
[13:12] you should have his word and you believe
[13:14] is God that you believe it that then
[13:17] that is God manifesting himself in your
[13:20] life and when you throw yourself
[13:22] completely over to God and allow him to
[13:26] working by believing his word then if it
[13:29] will bring the same operation of the
[13:31] Spirit be working 3 yes that's why we
[13:36] believe that is 2nd Peter but Peter said
[13:39] according as his divine how he's telling
[13:42] about you get the new birth these time
[13:45] oh he's bringing he's laying out what
[13:47] faith is you start off with you your own
[13:51] faith you're believing and then God when
[13:53] he gives you the new birth to you guys
[13:56] his own faith
[13:57] that's right and I'm kind of laying this
[13:59] out because I don't want to impress upon
[14:01] you that you got something that you can
[14:03] do something with according as his
[14:06] divine power he gives us his divine
[14:08] power you you partakers of the divine
[14:11] nature and then he said beside this
[14:13] giving all diligence add to your faith
[14:15] so you've got the divine power and got
[14:18] the divine nature and that is faith so
[14:21] add to your faith virtue and so you
[14:23] start off with this base
[14:25] this face that that God has given you as
[14:28] his face Colossians 2:12 says buried
[14:31] with him in Baptism when y'all see you
[14:33] are risen with him through the faith of
[14:35] the operation of God whoever raised him
[14:38] from the dead the galatians 2:20 says i
[14:41] am crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[14:43] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[14:46] and the life which I now live in the
[14:47] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[14:50] God is his face is his faith let your
[14:53] living by so in other words it's like a
[14:56] locomotive that's sitting on the train
[14:58] tracks and down on the other side is
[15:00] this fire that's burning
[15:02] you got faith but the locomotive might
[15:04] be might be sitting there and it's got
[15:06] all of this potential to pull a great
[15:08] big old train load of cars but it's just
[15:11] sitting there on the tracks
[15:12] something's gotta happen to allow that
[15:14] thing to begin to move and what's got to
[15:16] happen is the engineer reaches over and
[15:18] opens that throttle up and it begins to
[15:23] move so you gotta turn loose that fate
[15:26] in your life well remember the said in
[15:28] faith in action he said if Moses
[15:33] would've took the favour of strong he'd
[15:35] have been known as another favor he'd be
[15:38] gone and in torment today but he's an
[15:41] immortal among men today because he
[15:43] chose rather and put his faith into
[15:46] action in other words he doesn't just
[15:48] sit it where and beside the burning bush
[15:50] but when God gave him faith when he when
[15:54] he was when he saw a revelation of God
[15:57] there at the burning bush he took his
[15:59] little staff and went down into
[16:00] impossibility and went down into an
[16:03] impossible looking situation and a Nord
[16:06] circumstances ignored all of the
[16:09] obstacles that were in his way and just
[16:11] said like right here how that is God
[16:13] said so and he was vindicated by an
[16:16] angel who come down and talked to him
[16:18] and told him that he was born for this
[16:19] purpose
[16:20] and Moses knew what he was talking about
[16:22] so he didn't stand by and baby around
[16:24] with it he put his faith into action yes
[16:28] that's what it takes no matter how much
[16:31] faith you got if if you won't use it
[16:33] it's no good to you if you won't use it
[16:37] it's no good and that's how you know a
[16:39] lot of people that may be sitting around
[16:41] and I believe I believe it but yeah you
[16:45] our families in all this already and I
[16:47] you know you do all sorts of
[16:51] predicaments and things that are the
[16:53] Salus and it's brilliant because that we
[16:56] won't open that throttle and turn it
[16:58] loose yeah what good is a god of Moses
[17:01] the famous things of the day what good
[17:03] is a story God you people who go to
[17:06] church and you church only teaches that
[17:07] some historical fact about the Holy
[17:09] Ghost coming back on the day of
[17:10] Pentecost there's no such a thing today
[17:12] that was healing back there well here
[17:14] does that beauty but look Jesus Christ
[17:16] lives he died he rose again according to
[17:19] the scriptures is alive forevermore and
[17:21] no works right he's still here and able
[17:24] to bring his work pass it will just turn
[17:27] loose and believe it and turn turn your
[17:29] faith loose and he said now this is I
[17:34] really want this this this is one thing
[17:36] that I just kind of love to get on is
[17:38] that you don't have to produce it not
[17:41] you know no um that's kind of let's kind
[17:46] of meditate on this person unnatural in
[17:48] a natural situation of a man and woman
[17:51] in the marriage the woman might have a
[17:53] job or whatever and she brings home some
[17:55] money or whatever but spiritually
[17:57] spiritually now the man and the woman
[18:00] are in a different kind of relationship
[18:01] the bride and the bridegroom as our
[18:05] relationship with God that the bride
[18:06] does not have to produce healing it is
[18:10] the bridegroom that doesn't all you have
[18:13] to do is believe that's all all Eve had
[18:16] to do to bring forth the child was just
[18:18] believe and
[18:19] word and when he's spoken let there be
[18:21] all you got to do is just believe and
[18:24] she would have had a child but she she
[18:25] she didn't go home with God's Word so
[18:28] you don't have to wait we think well I
[18:30] got a I got a manufactured something
[18:32] that takes the burden off of us all we
[18:35] got to do is believe it it's not up to
[18:37] us to produce the healing it's not up to
[18:39] us to produce the salvation it's not up
[18:42] to us to define our battle we're not the
[18:44] one fighting the battle right and all of
[18:47] those Old Testament stories today all
[18:49] David did was is throw stone how could
[18:52] David with a little stone defeat a big
[18:54] old Goliath with a spear and all those
[18:56] kind of things how could get in fight
[18:58] that battle how could a Daniel defeat
[19:01] the Lions Eric's never never the bride
[19:05] that in relationship to God that's
[19:07] actually doing the thing other than just
[19:09] believing how could the around it around
[19:12] Jericho how could they make the walls
[19:14] tumble down it's not the people doing
[19:17] anything other than just confessing
[19:18] God's Word you're not the one that has
[19:21] to produce it maybe you don't believe
[19:33] that you say well my faith is weak I
[19:35] waiting to deface it so you don't let
[19:36] the devil know that always say I've got
[19:39] faith I believe God with all my heart
[19:41] don't justify nothing of the devil he
[19:43] said take him at his word then it's all
[19:46] over on God then and not on you when you
[19:51] take it on the tape to take him at his
[19:52] word it puts everything on God it's not
[19:56] you you're not obligated to bring God's
[19:58] Word to pass he is the one that is
[20:00] obligated to bring his word to pass
[20:01] that's good as long as you take when you
[20:07] accept him as your healer don't never
[20:09] act like you're sick or crippled anymore
[20:11] believe that's revealed that's right
[20:13] as long as you take God at His Word in
[20:16] the world
[20:16] will produce what it promised it to do
[20:18] is that right now I have faith believe
[20:20] in with all your heart
[20:23] this won't ask you this upon these basis
[20:26] do you believe this to be the Word of
[20:27] God it cannot live in if it's God's Word
[20:30] it has to be true then if it's God's
[20:32] Word and it is true then he's obligated
[20:35] to every word that he's spoken here he's
[20:38] obligated to keep that word you see what
[20:41] that does it puts it all back on the man
[20:44] in the relationship sir my man is the
[20:46] one Jesus is the one that is obligated
[20:49] to produce his word because you know a
[20:54] lot of times we feel like if we're not
[20:57] getting healed quickly or not then
[20:58] people gonna look at us well but see
[21:02] that that takes the burden of proof off
[21:04] of you you're not the one that's
[21:06] obligated all you gotta do is believe
[21:08] and so if it doesn't looks like you're
[21:10] not getting healed or you're not being
[21:12] all answered in the cell or you're not
[21:13] you're not getting what you come maybe
[21:15] your kids are not coming back to the
[21:16] Lord fast enough or whatever this is
[21:19] although meal oh he said oh if we could
[21:32] only get that settled in our hearts how
[21:34] can i cancer be cured when the doctors
[21:36] give up yeah it's not this how can it be
[21:39] cured when the doctors say there is no
[21:41] way it's not me to try to figure it out
[21:46] it's take the word of the Holy Spirit he
[21:49] was the one who made the promise he's
[21:51] the one who confirmed that promise he's
[21:53] obligated to keep that promise
[21:55] okay that puts it all back on him it it
[22:00] ain't up to the doctor to try to find a
[22:02] way to give you what you need it ain't
[22:05] up to you figure it out it's all you so
[22:11] you don't have to produce it which means
[22:13] if you need any of these things that
[22:16] I've listed out then it's time to just
[22:18] open up that throttle and and believe
[22:21] God's Word trust him to bring his
[22:24] to pass and watch it watch it happen in
[22:27] your life because it's Bob there's all
[22:29] these promises in the Bible all the
[22:31] benefits is that psalm of David said for
[22:34] getting on his benefits the all these
[22:35] benefits that we have access to if we'll
[22:38] just believe and so if you need
[22:40] protection from disease oh my goodness
[22:42] the coronavirus coming around yeah if
[22:45] you need healing for your body if you
[22:47] need the new birth or if you need
[22:49] salvation for your children or if you
[22:51] need a job oh you know I don't I don't
[22:53] know what direction my life is supposed
[22:55] to have or I I don't know I needed I'm
[22:58] going through when we started getting
[23:01] the testimony territory I remember when
[23:04] when Esther was was when my wife was in
[23:06] labor with extra I had been laid off
[23:08] from a job month before that and I had
[23:11] no job when she was born and that was
[23:13] when the economy crashed and I didn't
[23:15] know it everywhere you go it nobody was
[23:18] hiring that's when you you got to put
[23:21] your faith to to work you you look into
[23:25] the Word of God and there's promises
[23:27] there right and you got to it you know
[23:29] it's fine to come to work and say I
[23:30] believe but there comes a point when you
[23:32] got to open up that throttle at the
[23:34] steam go to work and I believe oh you
[23:38] know program said Virts you is a pass
[23:40] for it to pass through it's just like
[23:42] that locomotive where there's a fire on
[23:45] the inside but some what to do how how
[23:56] to raise your family how to do things
[23:58] let that faith go to work you know but
[24:01] in Luke chapter 8 jesus said now the
[24:04] parable is this the seed is the word of
[24:06] God in other word if you plant a seed
[24:09] there's a law of God that a seed planted
[24:12] is going to come up and produce
[24:14] something so if the seed of God this the
[24:17] work that seed is the word the word God
[24:19] is planted in your heart and it's
[24:21] planning the ground it is going to
[24:24] produce something amen it's going to
[24:26] produce the word it's gonna come up
[24:28] that's right the same program sitting in
[24:31] the Church of the Living God I know
[24:32] we've got five movements the Word of God
[24:35] is the seed that produced
[24:36] the gospel and every divine promise of
[24:39] God in the Bible would produce if it's
[24:41] met in the right kind of a heart it'll
[24:43] produce the promise if you have need of
[24:45] salvation believe that he saved you and
[24:47] accept his sacrificial death and you
[24:49] shall receive what you've asked for if
[24:52] you're weary and gloomy and feel like
[24:54] that everyone's against you come unto me
[24:56] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[24:58] I'll give you rest
[24:59] that's a scene accept it and if you're
[25:02] sick he was wounded for our
[25:04] transgressions with his stripes were
[25:06] healed accept it it's a seed will
[25:09] produce that will produce amen no no I
[25:20] get just put on all these examples of
[25:22] people that despite struck them stances
[25:25] despite all equals of life they just put
[25:28] their faith into action I did not care
[25:30] what king said he's gonna bring that
[25:32] that offering and and cut his throat and
[25:35] let the blood run down despite all the
[25:38] laughing and everything that came to
[25:40] Noah did not care about all the laughing
[25:42] is he build that Ark for a hundred years
[25:44] as you worked and labored and people
[25:47] scoffed at him then finally he went into
[25:49] the ark and was safe Abraham did not
[25:51] care about all the laughing and odd
[25:53] looks and people from even his own
[25:55] family and and a lot and all the
[25:57] different things I have Moses didn't
[25:59] care about Pharaoh's saying what in the
[26:01] world are you doing it come in here with
[26:03] a staff and all the people in laughing
[26:05] and a faith is a big and brownie and and
[26:09] just goes in and takes over and takes
[26:12] charge amen David didn't care about all
[26:14] the all the Israelites standing there
[26:16] laughing the holy his own brother who do
[26:18] you what are you coming in here I know
[26:19] that you're just about the first for
[26:21] some nonsense but you go back and read
[26:24] that story of him until I thought all
[26:26] the Israelites well what are you doing
[26:28] here you just want to see what's going
[26:29] on you're just here to cause trouble he
[26:31] didn't care he's like he looked at
[26:34] Goliath and said is there not anybody
[26:35] here worthy to go fight against this guy
[26:37] and that's what real faith does
[26:40] you gotta turn it loose just because all
[26:42] those is realized they were Israelites
[26:44] but they were just standing there
[26:45] watching brother David turned his faith
[26:48] loose and did something baby brother and
[26:54] said there was a time when the toxin
[26:56] there wasn't meaning and many people
[26:57] died from their diseases but now you can
[27:00] be inoculated God one day made a toxin
[27:05] he's talking about it like when you go
[27:07] the doctor you get shot up to prevent
[27:09] diseases and everything and he says in
[27:11] the hour of his death the inoculation
[27:13] he'll strike he says what is a cancer
[27:17] what is the disease because I'm talking
[27:18] about it did you know the Bible predicts
[27:21] that in the last days though there'll be
[27:23] a germ warfare that diseases will break
[27:25] out from the colon will fall on everyone
[27:27] without the badness of the Holy Ghost my
[27:32] arms are so worn out from where the
[27:34] doctors has punched needles in to try to
[27:36] inoculate me from yellow fever and so
[27:38] forth
[27:38] I told about anything but they wouldn't
[27:40] listen to me but I've taken what God's
[27:42] going to do God got a serum goes in okis
[27:57] he said well as the plague Falls we'll
[27:59] just go down many of these time I the
[28:01] children of Israel down in Egypt will
[28:03] just go down beneath the ground and
[28:04] Acadie but shut the door down
[28:06] and I won't do it one good it will stay
[28:08] in the house and put a mask over our
[28:10] faces some disinfect on it but God
[28:14] problems were made a provided way and it
[28:16] was what the blood God divided it as
[28:19] simple as it seemed they take the blood
[28:21] of lamb and sprinkle the door yet God
[28:24] said that was his way and he honored him
[28:27] that's it
[28:28] brother Graham said it and questions an
[28:30] entry he said I'm God is love perfect
[28:33] love but you don't know what love is
[28:37] that's why people today don't know what
[28:40] faith in God is love it has to be in
[28:44] love he's sovereign to his more
[28:46] and he has to keep his word he has to
[28:49] love you than if he loves you that you
[28:54] will stop running
