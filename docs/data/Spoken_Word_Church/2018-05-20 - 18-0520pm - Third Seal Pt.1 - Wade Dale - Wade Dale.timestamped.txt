[25:42] it is addresses and everything so he has
[25:45] an information packet see brother Joseph
[25:47] Canada if you're thinking about
[25:49] attending like I said there's space for
[25:52] about thirty of us and and there'll be
[25:56] some modern conveniences instead of the
[26:00] the woods the atmosphere still gonna be
[26:03] a little woodsy but it's not gonna be
[26:04] like it was up there you know eight
[26:06] miles back in the boondocks so but thank
[26:10] God that we can do stuff like that that
[26:11] we can still get together as brothers
[26:14] and then sisters can get together too
[26:16] and do things so it's really wonderful
[26:18] that we can do that so
[26:20] and we think brother Dale for allowing
[26:22] us a chance to do it amen
[26:25] so if you would if you got your Bibles
[26:27] let's turn now we're going to start on
[26:29] we'll get the chart back up here in a
[26:31] second we're going to start on the third
[26:32] seal this morning we were on number two
[26:35] now remember keep this in the back your
[26:38] mind God is perfected in threes the man
[26:43] God is perfected in three that's why I
[26:46] said this third seal is going to be
[26:48] maybe I hope all this is it's not
[26:52] something new but it will it maybe it'll
[26:54] help you think a little more about
[26:58] not just the seal in the horses in the
[27:00] black in the red but it still they all
[27:02] come together to paint a picture there's
[27:05] a picture that God wants us to see
[27:07] because we are visual people all right
[27:09] and God wants us to understand and look
[27:11] this is the only way God wants us to
[27:14] understand or he would have wrote it
[27:15] totally different so this is the way
[27:18] amen so we don't want to change you to
[27:20] say well God should have done it this no
[27:22] it's perfect than the way it was written
[27:25] the first time we've just got of what
[27:27] the Bible say conformed to his image
[27:30] problem is is we want God sometimes to
[27:32] conform to our image but gods that we
[27:35] need to conform to his image all right
[27:37] and there's nothing on this earth can
[27:40] stop us except ourself we are our own
[27:43] worst enemy amen
[27:45] hey man they meant we're own worst enemy
[27:49] so he's still working on me amen
[27:53] so revelations now we're going to
[27:55] revelation 6 verse 5 this will be the
[27:59] third seal part 1 remember now again God
[28:01] is perfected in threes now remember
[28:05] there are four parts to this that we're
[28:08] going to cover number 4 for the rapture
[28:11] amen because there's four combat beasts
[28:14] there was four worms that ate the tree
[28:18] down so there's got to be for life
[28:19] messengers which is the lion ox man an
[28:21] eagle to restore but God is perfected in
[28:25] threes all right ma'am so let's bow our
[28:28] heads before we get started dear Lord we
[28:31] thank you again today that we have this
[28:32] opportunity to stand in front of the
[28:35] cream of the crop no doubt nowhere could
[28:39] a person stand and have the greatest
[28:41] people in one building except for your
[28:44] bride and that's right here Lord today
[28:47] we are speaking to the ones that the
[28:52] Bible says to whom the end of the world
[28:55] has come upon but Lord we're not scared
[28:59] for that oh if we're if we're scared
[29:02] Lord take that fear away from us if
[29:04] we're scared that means we want to stay
[29:05] here more than we want to be with you
[29:08] Lord just take that fear away Lord that
[29:11] will that
[29:12] you will surely reach into the womb of
[29:14] our mind and implant the perfect seed
[29:17] Word of God and that it will cultivate
[29:19] and grow and it'll be into a stature of
[29:23] a perfect man which was you Lord you
[29:25] walked on this earth a perfect man so
[29:27] you gave us the example that we can walk
[29:30] on this earth as a perfect man Father
[29:33] forgive us of our sins and bless this
[29:35] day that we're we have here Lord set
[29:37] aside speak to the people Lord you be
[29:39] the speaker be the active participant in
[29:42] the service Lord be the one that does
[29:44] the speaking and the hearing and only
[29:46] one that can do the revealing father
[29:49] just be with us we were the ones that
[29:50] are traveling big with mom and dad as
[29:53] they're on the way back that you'll be
[29:54] able with them and bless them maybe give
[29:57] them a little time there to rest and
[29:58] relax then we all start all over again
[30:01] and to your word father just take care
[30:05] of us be with the missionaries on the
[30:07] foreign fields give them fruit for their
[30:09] labor father we have seized things in
[30:11] Jesus name Amen all right remember God
[30:16] is perfected in three all right and we
[30:19] had opened the third seal I heard the
[30:21] third beast say come and see
[30:23] and I beheld and lo a black horse and he
[30:26] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[30:28] in his hand now there are several
[30:30] different things that are different in
[30:32] this sea you had seal one you had seal
[30:34] two now the third seals a little bit
[30:35] longer and also the third seal has got a
[30:38] little added something to it there's
[30:41] something added to this one that's not
[30:43] in any of the other ones all right and
[30:46] what is it verse six a voice all right
[30:50] because remember the third beast said
[30:53] come and see and then John is the eye I
[30:57] beheld or looked and lo a black horse
[31:00] and him that sat on him had a pair of
[31:02] balances in his hand so that's what John
[31:04] saw and I heard a voice in the midst of
[31:06] the four beasts and there right in the
[31:08] middle of the lion ox man an eagle there
[31:09] was a voice went out that happened in no
[31:12] other seal except this one why that's
[31:18] why we're here to help you understand
[31:20] the why say and then What did he say a
[31:22] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[31:24] measures of
[31:25] Arlie for a penny and see thou hurt not
[31:28] the oil and the wine you may be seated
[31:31] in the Lord I just blessing to the
[31:32] reading the word while brother Danny's
[31:33] getting that I want to read this to you
[31:37] you won't have it in some of using heavy
[31:39] notes you won't have it by I just came
[31:41] upon this and the Book of Isaiah cuz
[31:43] we're heading toward if we look at the
[31:45] third seal its perfected in threes but
[31:48] we'll read it on the screen here how
[31:49] about that got okay
[31:51] Isaiah 28 12 I try to every morning I've
[31:55] tried to at least read about ten minutes
[31:56] of Scripture and I try think about - you
[32:05] know meditate on a little bit because
[32:07] you know you read the Word of God it's
[32:08] not just like reading anything you read
[32:10] the Word of God it's got talking to you
[32:11] but well I came upon this and I thought
[32:14] man right here in the Book of Isaiah 28
[32:16] 12 to whom he says this is the rest now
[32:19] what we're talking about you said what's
[32:22] this got with a third do with the third
[32:23] seal we'll show it to you in just a
[32:24] little while because we're talking about
[32:26] this is the rest what is the rest to a
[32:29] believer it's the baptism of the Holy
[32:32] Ghost that is your rest all right
[32:36] to whom he saying this is the rest
[32:38] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[32:40] rest and this is the refreshing yet they
[32:43] would not hear but the word of the Lord
[32:47] wasn't to them precept upon precept
[32:49] precept upon precept line upon line line
[32:52] upon line here a little in there little
[32:54] that they might go and fall backwards
[32:57] and be broken and snared and taken
[32:58] that's for the ones that wouldn't hear
[33:01] all right wherefore hear the word of the
[33:03] Lord hear the word of the Lord
[33:06] you scornful men that ruled this people
[33:08] which is in Jerusalem because you have
[33:11] said we have made a covenant with death
[33:14] and with hell are we at agreement now
[33:18] that's the scornful man but watch what
[33:21] Isaiah when the overflowing scourge
[33:23] shall pass through it shall not come
[33:25] unto us but we have made lies our refuge
[33:28] and under falsehood have we hid
[33:30] ourselves now that's not good
[33:32] and then but watch this therefore thus
[33:36] saith the Lord that is God
[33:39] behold I lay in Zion for a foundation of
[33:42] stone stone is a revelation a tried
[33:46] stone a precious cornerstone a sure
[33:48] foundation that he that believeth shall
[33:52] not make haste
[33:54] y'all gonna try to set up on the front
[33:56] row today good I have some subjects
[34:01] judgment also will I wait to the line
[34:04] and righteousness to the plummet and the
[34:06] hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies
[34:08] and the water shall overflow to the
[34:10] hiding place and your covenant with
[34:13] death everybody this born has a covenant
[34:18] with death and your covenant with death
[34:22] shall be dis an old that's the only time
[34:26] that words used in the Bible now there's
[34:28] a word dissing o or dissing oweth but
[34:31] the word dissing old means atonement
[34:35] when you look up the word atonement it
[34:38] comes right back to that definition when
[34:40] you look up dissing old it takes you
[34:41] right to make an atonement so there's
[34:44] already been an atonement made to break
[34:47] this covenant with death and your
[34:50] agreement with hell shall not stand man
[34:54] I love man when I saw that oh god it's
[34:57] all laying in the word that's our body
[35:00] change that's our body change our
[35:04] covenant with death shall be dissin old
[35:08] done away with atoned for
[35:12] amen from the time it go forth it shall
[35:15] take you now he's talking about the
[35:16] scourge going through the land we're
[35:18] never have a part of that we're not
[35:20] going part of that I'm gonna go by what
[35:23] Gautreaux back down nobody that's saith
[35:28] the Lord God that's what I'm gonna take
[35:31] and if we you and I are the daughter of
[35:33] Zion I lay in Zion so we're the
[35:36] daughters of Zion we get the benefits of
[35:39] this and this was written under the
[35:43] blood of bulls and goats but you know
[35:45] what it's the true Word of God and man
[35:48] when I saw I said man there is our body
[35:50] chains laying right there in the Book of
[35:51] Isaiah
[35:52] my covenant with death shall be dissin
[35:56] old in other words done away with or it
[35:58] has already been atoned for you manage
[36:02] that alright that's enough we can go
[36:07] home then if you Hey if you just believe
[36:10] that we don't need nothing else but we
[36:13] got to go through and we got to we got
[36:15] to explain it a little bit maybe so now
[36:19] we come up to the third seal everybody
[36:22] all right say Amen first three church
[36:25] ages was the first seal got it the
[36:29] second seal typed the mental age and the
[36:33] lap overs of age three four and five is
[36:35] that okay because there is a lap over
[36:38] I'll read it to you next Sunday where
[36:39] brother bottom talks a couple of times
[36:41] about a lap over so we got to do not put
[36:43] number seven in here but now what's
[36:46] covered in the third seal is here this
[36:51] is Lutheran Wesley's age or the age of
[36:54] Reformation starting in the restoration
[36:57] and then here's your lap because this is
[37:00] your man age so what happened in that go
[37:05] back to Revelation six if you wish
[37:07] please is that third beast which is the
[37:11] man step forward and said come and see
[37:15] and then there went a black horse and it
[37:18] was the same person that was riding on
[37:20] the other horse amen Satan riding the
[37:24] horse but he had a pair of balances in
[37:27] his hand and then I heard a voice in the
[37:29] midst of the four beasts say a measure
[37:31] of wheat for penny and three measures of
[37:33] the barley for a penny and see thou not
[37:34] hurt the old one now we all know as in
[37:37] studying the message of the hour that
[37:38] brother Branham tells us that that's the
[37:41] seal the seal is is the measure of wheat
[37:44] for a penny when they started selling
[37:46] novenas and trying to sell your way into
[37:49] heaven from sister Anna Canard when the
[37:52] Catholic Church she knows that that it's
[37:54] not it's not fiction it is fiction to us
[37:57] but to them it's a reality I mean you
[37:59] pay four dollars you say twelve Hail
[38:00] Marys you know you kissed your for
[38:02] rosary beads and you're done and that's
[38:05] the truth in it now
[38:06] why the Catholic Church got so that's so
[38:08] mm-hmm got so rich during this time
[38:12] people started paying for it you know
[38:14] paying their way out now you got to pay
[38:16] your way out of purgatory but listen
[38:20] they fell for it they fell for it they
[38:24] got on that horse and they rode that
[38:26] horse and that horse was black so now we
[38:32] can skip let's go to let's go let's go
[38:40] down to matthew 24:6
[38:42] we know that this we're talking about
[38:44] Redemption so this has got to be
[38:45] Redemption Redemption Redemption I keep
[38:48] saying it over and over again but the
[38:50] word Redemption means what to bring back
[38:52] so what God wants to do is bring back
[38:54] full fellowship he wants to bring back
[38:57] to where he and us can talk face to face
[39:04] hey man that's what he wants and that's
[39:07] what you should want amen
[39:09] I don't want a substitute I want to talk
[39:11] to God amen I don't want to have to do
[39:13] like Catholic Church and go through a
[39:15] priest who goes through dead Saints who
[39:16] goes to God somewhere in there the
[39:18] interpretation might get wrong and I
[39:20] might not get what I asked for but if I
[39:22] say something to the man himself then
[39:24] I'll get what I asked for
[39:26] amen so Matthew 24 verse 6 the prophet
[39:29] of God said this is Jesus preaching the
[39:31] seals they meant amen
[39:34] this is Jesus preaching the seals you
[39:37] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[39:40] see that you be not troubled for all
[39:43] these things must come to pass but the
[39:47] end is not yet for nation shall rise
[39:50] against nation and Kingdom against
[39:53] Kingdom I wrote in my Bible I put Satan
[39:57] right above here and I put God right
[39:59] above here because God's kingdom don't
[40:03] fight against God so it's Satan's
[40:07] Kingdom against God's kingdom there
[40:09] shall be famine pestilence earthquakes
[40:11] and diverse plate look what's happening
[40:12] now all these are the beginning of
[40:14] Sorrows you say what's all this got to
[40:16] do now look we got to go back now and
[40:19] say the
[40:20] oh this is this is white right red now
[40:27] we come to black now what happened in
[40:31] these ages and I'll bring some of the
[40:33] quotes next week this is the white
[40:40] righteous church so there had to be a
[40:42] real church on the earth right then you
[40:46] had to have a red horse rider which was
[40:49] in this age right here that there was 68
[40:52] million killed bloody war a man killed
[40:57] actually they didn't even how much to
[40:59] fight with they were just killed a man
[41:02] all right they were just killed by what
[41:04] the Roman Catholic Church and you say
[41:06] well it's the Roman Catholic Church no
[41:08] it's the devil under the auspice of a
[41:12] Roman Catholic Church the man it could
[41:14] be the devil under the message if we
[41:15] start killing people man so it's the
[41:18] it's the as the attack came from the
[41:21] person that was on the horse all right
[41:23] which was Satan not God amen so then you
[41:26] got your red horse running through this
[41:29] age now we come up here to my age coming
[41:32] out of the Dark Ages everybody with me
[41:35] coming out of the Dark Ages I'm gonna
[41:37] keep you awake today coming out of the
[41:39] Dark Ages into what the man anointing we
[41:44] had a lion anointing bold strong
[41:47] fearless in that first church age that
[41:50] second church agent part of the third
[41:52] church age silver and gold have I none
[41:54] but what I have give I unto thee rise up
[41:57] and walk pretty bold all right all these
[41:59] different things you come down to this
[42:00] the age of the Ox it was a labor just to
[42:03] be a Christian you were killed and they
[42:05] labored through the longest church age
[42:07] which was number four that church age
[42:09] lasted over a thousand years some of the
[42:12] other ones only lasts a few hundred all
[42:14] right now we come out of that now when
[42:16] we come out of that you in your studies
[42:19] in in school that would they will call
[42:23] it the Renaissance days the Reformation
[42:25] is when everything starts what happens
[42:28] is is everything begins to be
[42:30] educational
[42:36] they were ignorant and unlearned
[42:39] fishermen in this age couldn't write
[42:41] their name but you know I was thinking
[42:43] the other day let me give you a little
[42:44] let me give you a little Porter
[42:46] brother Brian said that the new birth
[42:48] can be understood by the most illiterate
[42:49] person now what is an illiterate person
[42:51] that means somebody can't read doesn't
[42:55] have a formal education but how can that
[42:58] person have the whole to get the Holy
[42:59] Ghost it's not in written word right
[43:05] take a guy take a man or a woman take a
[43:08] man that has never read one thing
[43:10] because look Peter never read anything
[43:13] it's kind of obvious Peter couldn't even
[43:15] read the Torah he couldn't read now Paul
[43:20] could read he takes the Old Testament
[43:22] and he would tithe that's why he wrote
[43:23] most of the Bible but Peter just took
[43:26] you by faith amen but you take a man
[43:30] that's a literate and unlearned he's a
[43:33] man right but he knows one thing for
[43:36] sure whether he can read one word out of
[43:40] a book he should know that there's
[43:43] something wrong with him that he's lost
[43:46] he should know that without having to
[43:49] read anything cuz listen how many of us
[43:52] saw Jesus how many have saw him on the
[43:54] cross how many of us how many of us have
[43:56] a case that we can build no we gotta
[43:58] have it by faith anyway but we can't
[44:00] read but sometimes what we read may be
[44:02] wrong but the most illiterate person the
[44:05] Prophet said could receive the baptism
[44:07] of the Holy Ghost so it's not intellect
[44:09] of man it's a man living in this world
[44:15] realizing there's dirty thoughts there's
[44:17] dirty things going on and you know what
[44:19] he only has to have one person one
[44:23] person to live a Christian life and if
[44:26] he sees that person he's condemned
[44:29] that's all he needs if he sees that
[44:31] person he's condemned he ever gets
[44:33] preached one sermon too he's condemned
[44:36] so he don't have to be able to read he's
[44:39] gonna believe in his heart where you
[44:43] should believe to start with but he's
[44:44] going to believe in his heart whether he
[44:46] has to read it
[44:47] or not so that's where the most
[44:49] illiterate person can receive the
[44:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's not
[44:53] written down oh yeah they're just
[44:59] written all through the Bible brother
[45:00] wait it's not written down how that way
[45:02] Dale can get saved because the way I got
[45:07] saved it might be a little bit different
[45:08] the way he got say because he had a
[45:10] different background okay you may
[45:13] receive the Holy Ghost in the altar I
[45:15] may receive mine somewhere else
[45:18] amen but this word directs us back to it
[45:22] okay so that's why you reason I'm saying
[45:25] that is when we come up to this third
[45:28] seal I see why it's black intelligence
[45:39] listen we made gunpowder it started out
[45:43] as firecrackers in China right then what
[45:46] they do they decided to shove it down in
[45:48] a barrel and shoot you with it Amen
[45:50] right intelligence of man the
[45:53] development you think about you see
[45:56] we're still we're still living in this
[45:58] man age because look at this age now my
[46:01] goodness a computer you buy a computer
[46:03] today and three months later it's
[46:04] obsolete why because of technology not
[46:07] because of God because of technology we
[46:10] wonder about all this Wi-Fi service
[46:14] God's always worked Wi-Fi he's always
[46:19] the hot spot to me I don't have to look
[46:21] for a hot spot he is the hot spot but
[46:23] you see he communicates but look so
[46:26] Satan is going to pervert that and what
[46:28] I'm getting to it Satan is going to
[46:29] pervert that he's going to bring come
[46:31] out of this they jump on this black
[46:33] horse and he's going to have a pair of
[46:36] balances in his hand
[46:37] now what imbalance is for weight to
[46:42] weigh something balance is never you
[46:46] remember using those old yeah some of us
[46:49] do some of us are going what you mean
[46:51] it's digital yeah no we used to have to
[46:55] take in either add weights or slide away
[46:59] to cross
[47:00] right okay now all we do is sit it on
[47:04] the thing hit the button and it says you
[47:07] know seventeen point three four ounces
[47:09] well we didn't care about the three four
[47:10] ounces when we were first coming up we
[47:13] just care didn't wait 17 ounces go
[47:15] that's all we had on the little thing
[47:16] that we pulled across the scale but you
[47:18] see how man is as man has progressed
[47:22] because remember we'll read it next
[47:24] Sunday the Bible says has your light
[47:29] become darkness that's the worst that's
[47:34] the worst thing is that you think you
[47:37] have light and it's dark man has put
[47:41] things together and thought this is the
[47:43] greatest the greatest thing that we've
[47:46] ever come on to and what is it done now
[47:49] y'all remember July the first I think it
[47:52] is in the state of Georgia you can't use
[47:53] your cell phone while you're driving
[47:55] down the road and you don't get grace
[47:59] man don't have grace you know why 1,600
[48:04] people a year in the state of Georgia
[48:06] die die are injured because of texting
[48:11] and cell phone you see what I'm saying
[48:12] we think man that thing everybody's got
[48:15] a cell phone pretty close by right if
[48:17] you lost that sucker you'd be like you
[48:19] know you lose your kid lose you dog but
[48:21] don't lose your cell phone but honest
[48:27] honest but what we've come to though is
[48:30] depend on that so much we drive down the
[48:32] road and we go we hit some man kill them
[48:35] right so what it's technology that we
[48:40] tame and this is how do we do without
[48:42] you know we come through the era we come
[48:45] through the era of a pager you better
[48:48] remember a pager oh yeah that was the
[48:51] greatest thing well it wasn't cuz they
[48:52] could find you then right we thought
[48:56] pager man this is this is something yeah
[49:00] vibrating you bout run off the road
[49:01] anyway you know but then that thing now
[49:04] is you know I read the paper this
[49:06] morning listen to this email has become
[49:10] obsolete
[49:14] email has become obsolete
[49:17] because it's texting an instant
[49:20] messaging Instagram and all these they
[49:22] don't email anymore if we keep going if
[49:24] y'all keep going like you're going
[49:26] you're gonna put me out of business
[49:26] because the post office is not getting
[49:28] any first-class mail anymore
[49:30] we're only delivering packages because
[49:32] we don't we're not in the email business
[49:35] or the Instagram or anything like but
[49:37] let you see what I mean about technology
[49:39] technology is great
[49:41] I don't mind it I've got a cell phone
[49:42] myself but you better be careful with
[49:44] that thing if I think kills 1600 people
[49:46] a year what it's done is is that
[49:48] technology is being used but what's
[49:52] happening there's death there's always
[49:54] what man advances there's always death
[49:57] attached to it but now on the flip side
[49:59] whatever God makes there's life attached
[50:03] to it hey man whatever God brings to us
[50:06] is there's life attached to it that's
[50:08] why in this third Church in this third
[50:10] search is in the third seal we see that
[50:13] it is man and it's not this knowledge
[50:18] will not like the Bible says knowledge
[50:20] puffeth up you know even the Bible says
[50:22] come let us reason together but we
[50:25] shouldn't reason you see what I'm saying
[50:27] I was thinking about this in there just
[50:29] a few minutes ago when we talk about and
[50:31] we compartmentalize that soul the soul
[50:33] is either faith or doubt and then but
[50:38] now remember they're all connected you
[50:40] can't pull them apart but God can by the
[50:45] word through a prophet he can pull them
[50:48] apart and show you what their
[50:49] characteristics are but you can't have a
[50:52] soul without a spirit you can't be
[50:53] without a soul can't soul without a body
[50:55] can't everybody was better so they're
[50:57] all connected and then but now once
[51:00] they're connected you can disconnect the
[51:01] spirit or the soul I mean and put it in
[51:06] the sixth dimension and your body stays
[51:08] here you can do that in death but watch
[51:11] what God does god tapes and says all
[51:14] right you got memories and constant
[51:16] effects and imagination in the middle
[51:17] realm you've got faith or doubt in this
[51:19] realm there's no gray area but in this
[51:21] realm here your memory is the greatest
[51:25] thing you need
[51:26] need to remember what God said but you
[51:31] also your memory is what's killing us
[51:32] and then so they split down the middle
[51:36] even in the spirit realm you've got two
[51:39] memories you've got two reasoning
[51:41] sometimes we reason against the Word of
[51:43] God but the Bible says come let us
[51:46] reason together now let's talk about
[51:48] something our conscious our conscious is
[51:52] what condemns us but I'm also conscious
[51:55] that God's in my soul and that if I let
[51:59] him he'll do the work
[52:00] memory reason conscious affection now
[52:04] listen that's one thing you can't do
[52:07] remember brother Branham said that that
[52:10] your soul is it's perfect love if you're
[52:13] boarding you alright that's perfect love
[52:14] everybody wants to know watch perfect
[52:16] love it's the new birth you said how do
[52:20] you know that you got to go back and
[52:24] watch what brother Branham said he said
[52:25] when I went across that curtain of time
[52:26] in the sixth dimension he said all that
[52:30] was there was perfect love now what do
[52:34] they all have in common
[52:35] not that they were green green not that
[52:38] they were tall short black white orange
[52:40] purple three no what was the one thing I
[52:44] don't know where that came from Susan
[52:46] made me say that
[52:47] you looked at me and I said green but
[52:51] what do they all have in common in that
[52:53] dimension every person in that dimension
[52:56] had eternal life in their soul when they
[53:00] can't when they were on the earth they
[53:01] received about different Holy Ghost a
[53:03] guy that went into that dimension then
[53:05] the Burt the perfect love it's what
[53:06] everybody's looking for you know you
[53:08] these people with you know the return
[53:11] ministry and stuff their ball brother
[53:13] bonds got to come back brings perfect
[53:14] love no I don't think so I think we have
[53:17] perfect love now I think we have perfect
[53:20] I don't think I know we have perfect
[53:22] local that's what's gonna take us to
[53:23] that side if we have to go I said if we
[53:26] have to go then if we don't guess what
[53:29] we're gonna bring that here but memory
[53:32] reason conscious affection listen you
[53:35] don't love your wife with a godly love
[53:38] sorry
[53:40] because you love your wife with feel
[53:42] your love now the unfeigned love of the
[53:46] Brethren is the guffy love that's in the
[53:49] Bible that's the love of God all right
[53:52] but now your spirit realm remember look
[53:54] what brother Brown said he said it goes
[53:56] from it goes from what it goes from
[53:58] God's love to the love for your wife and
[54:01] you then you got love for your kids then
[54:04] you got then it all what comes all the
[54:06] way down to lust you see how the Satan
[54:07] is using that middle room he's bringing
[54:10] it to lust amen
[54:12] God don't have anything unless it's not
[54:13] included in anything God does yeah man
[54:15] he is the most pure love that we ever
[54:18] seen in our life and that's what we're
[54:21] working toward because we got to keep
[54:22] going up it statue of a perfect man the
[54:24] man and then reasoning conscious
[54:27] affection imagination boy now there is
[54:29] no imagination in God he's real there's
[54:36] no imaginary God there's no well I
[54:38] imagine if God's gonna know if he said
[54:40] he was gonna do it he's gonna do it
[54:41] brother right he said he's gonna do it
[54:42] he's gonna do it you know what he's got
[54:45] this is what I I love what brother said
[54:48] one time he said I think was brother
[54:50] Ernie he said he said I want to attach
[54:53] myself to the eternal hey man I want to
[54:57] attach myself to the eternal because if
[55:00] there's eternal life God said I could
[55:02] have it God said I could live for an
[55:04] eternity God said I could live on this
[55:07] earth in an eternal body I'm just gonna
[55:10] believe it I can attach myself to that
[55:13] hey man y'all must not cuz you're not
[55:15] too happy about it
[55:17] hello that's our problem we say eternal
[55:23] life they go people go yeah no eternal
[55:27] life so life your mom and daddy didn't
[55:31] give you it's a life that God give you
[55:36] hey man so our intelligence is not so
[55:39] bad if we use it right we have to bring
[55:42] a message but sometimes in our
[55:44] intelligence we muddle things up
[55:48] sometimes we get stuck on the details we
[55:55] do we all do but you know what we're
[55:58] doing we're reasoning using our own
[56:02] reasoning well what if and what if well
[56:04] what if they know what if and God like I
[56:08] said before he said it read Isaiah now
[56:11] if we would just believe that one
[56:13] passage the scripture I read you man to
[56:15] go it's appointed unto man wants to die
[56:21] oh we got to go we got to die because
[56:25] God said in the Bible this appointed
[56:26] unto man once to die well now how can he
[56:29] say it's appointed unto man once to die
[56:31] and he says your covenant would there
[56:34] shall be dissin old there's something in
[56:37] our reasoning that's not put that to
[56:39] them - together and then there's
[56:41] something in our reasoning that's not
[56:43] put this thing together well now in this
[56:45] seal that coming up we look at this we
[56:49] look at this thing called black we look
[56:58] at this and we go that is so bad yea
[57:04] though I walk through the valley of the
[57:06] shadow of death or fear no evil right
[57:10] black no it might be black in a certain
[57:14] place but there must be light go there's
[57:16] a shadow and then so you take the black
[57:20] horse
[57:22] Satan jumps on that black horse and he
[57:25] then it's not seized he's smart he come
[57:29] from here made itself really righteous
[57:31] and God itself in and like I said
[57:33] attached itself to that early church
[57:36] sure he did
[57:37] all right he comes in here and you know
[57:39] what he shows his color and he says if
[57:44] they don't believe me I'll just kill him
[57:49] if they don't believe me I'll just kill
[57:51] him I'll try to wipe out as many of them
[57:55] as I can wipe out and when he saw though
[58:00] when he saw that he couldn't wipe them
[58:02] all out that God started right back
[58:05] would see because here's the Roman
[58:07] Catholic Church and they're going along
[58:08] and Satan's like man I got in the man of
[58:10] the hour I got the Pope and I got
[58:11] everything going right we got all these
[58:13] monks and we got all these people
[58:14] getting money for novenas and they're
[58:16] paying penance and we got command this
[58:18] thing it's great all of a sudden Martin
[58:20] Luther says stop talkin drop Satan goes
[58:26] pretty come from because God had him hid
[58:32] God had him hit right in the very thing
[58:36] that was killing the people God had
[58:39] Martin Luther in the system riding
[58:44] Satan's Eden he had a man of God the
[58:47] blackest hour there ever was Roman
[58:49] Catholicism covered the whole ran they
[58:53] meant right and Satan's like going now
[58:58] kill them all
[58:59] Martin Luther goes hey we don't have to
[59:05] do what they say what Luther we don't
[59:10] have to do what they say he said no he
[59:12] said the just shall live by faith
[59:16] read it right here says it in the Old
[59:19] Testament even before the new was wrote
[59:20] the Old Testament says it's just a live
[59:22] effect amen and then he made that the
[59:25] problem that Satan had was that there
[59:29] was some believers that believe what
[59:32] Martin Luther said if it would've just
[59:33] been one man oh he started out as a
[59:36] one-man army but then this one started
[59:38] believing what he said this one started
[59:40] believing what he said this one started
[59:42] believing what he's saying and they
[59:44] started believing what Martin Luther
[59:45] said why because there were believers
[59:47] there there was the seed Word of God
[59:50] laying there ready to be quickened right
[59:56] in the Roman Catholic Church I love I
[59:58] love God for saving my soul but I love
[1:00:00] him
[1:00:01] that he
[1:00:01] I can do things that is impossible
[1:00:04] seemingly impossible that he can take
[1:00:08] the very church and start you know
[1:00:14] that's why we're Protestants come from I
[1:00:16] know he most you know that Pradas that
[1:00:18] means protest they were Pro Parton
[1:00:22] Luther protested the Catholic Church the
[1:00:25] 95 theses that he nailed up on the wall
[1:00:27] right so there was a Protestant
[1:00:30] Reformation began with Martin Luther in
[1:00:34] the blackest hour God takes a man they
[1:00:39] Martin Luther and as Satan is he's man
[1:00:44] he's got it I'm gonna make this place
[1:00:47] just as dark as I can make it I don't
[1:00:50] want no Christians nowhere around me
[1:00:53] Martin Luther teaching it wherever in
[1:00:58] Oxford to wherever he was over there and
[1:01:01] he looks in the Bible and he goes the
[1:01:05] Bible says the just shall live by faith
[1:01:08] the just shall live by faith so Josh
[1:01:13] shall live by faith and it strikes him
[1:01:16] what the word struck the man and what he
[1:01:19] did he turn the world upside down
[1:01:21] because people didn't begin to believe
[1:01:25] Jim's dad always blesses her Jim's dad
[1:01:29] always thought that my dad thought
[1:01:30] William Brennan was a prophet nobody
[1:01:32] else when we first met you know he he
[1:01:35] thought this William Branham man was
[1:01:37] just some man that my daddy attached
[1:01:39] yourself to and and there was nobody
[1:01:42] else we have this radical place up here
[1:01:45] in Lula Georgia that nobody this was in
[1:01:47] the 70s then nobody knew nothing about
[1:01:49] and who ever heard of this William
[1:01:52] Branham person and the Lord there was an
[1:01:57] odd thing happened Jim's dad was at the
[1:02:00] house one day and was it brother for
[1:02:03] cash first
[1:02:03] brother for cash comes to visit this guy
[1:02:08] from India believes the same thing y'all
[1:02:10] believe
[1:02:11] yeah just a few weeks later Keith Reed
[1:02:15] or somebody came into the house and Jews
[1:02:17] daddy was there and here's Keith Reed
[1:02:20] and he believes that William Brandon was
[1:02:22] a prophet he believes the same thing we
[1:02:23] all believe there's somebody Jamaica
[1:02:25] believes what y'all believe so he
[1:02:28] realized but see he thought we was so
[1:02:29] narrow-minded he really thought that
[1:02:31] that we was the daddy was the only
[1:02:33] person that believed William Brennan was
[1:02:34] a prophet that's what Satan wanted to do
[1:02:38] he wanted to take Martin Luther and say
[1:02:41] no Martin Luther you can't do that but
[1:02:43] see you can't put out the plan of God
[1:02:45] the plan of God is forever settled in
[1:02:49] heaven and it's going to be carried out
[1:02:51] on earth remember because Redemption
[1:02:54] doesn't take place in heaven redemption
[1:02:58] takes place here amen
[1:03:00] hey BAE all right so now what Martin
[1:03:04] Luther did is Martin Luther come out of
[1:03:06] that of that time of the fourth church
[1:03:08] age coming into the fifth Church aid and
[1:03:11] Satan jumps on his black horse and said
[1:03:14] okay all right I'm not gonna kill them
[1:03:18] physically now I'm gonna let them live
[1:03:22] but I'm gonna get to them intellectually
[1:03:27] and they can be alive and be the deadest
[1:03:33] people on the face of the earth the dead
[1:03:36] is Pete and that's the works dead like I
[1:03:37] said before dying it's not bad it's
[1:03:41] being alive and be dead
[1:03:43] amen but now also let's flip that over
[1:03:46] because we've got a we're gonna watch
[1:03:48] this today you got to flip that over
[1:03:51] because to be for you to be alive Christ
[1:03:56] King Live
[1:04:01] Paul said dead dead not divorced dead
[1:04:08] that old man has got to be dead so that
[1:04:13] Christ can live in your heart
[1:04:18] everybody all right
[1:04:21] now look we're gonna stop right here
[1:04:24] just for a second because I I think we
[1:04:26] kind of got the basis of this third seal
[1:04:29] it's a black horse and he's going to be
[1:04:31] riding with a pair of balances of
[1:04:33] weights of scales and we'll talk about
[1:04:36] the voice and then these are going to be
[1:04:38] the listen there's more things happen
[1:04:41] this is you know a thousand years this
[1:04:43] way and this is pretty much only five
[1:04:48] hundred years this way and there was
[1:04:50] more in this of look what happened you
[1:04:54] know your horse and buggy even in our
[1:04:56] age you know you look you some of you
[1:04:57] older ones can remember horse and buggy
[1:05:02] even just in our place that we're
[1:05:04] sitting around here we've come from
[1:05:05] we've come from yeah we've come from all
[1:05:11] that to what we up do now even in our
[1:05:13] lifetime you understand what I'm saying
[1:05:15] so in this short period of time though
[1:05:17] Satan jumped in and said I'm going to
[1:05:19] make everybody intelligent and you know
[1:05:21] what I'm going to do I'm going to divide
[1:05:23] them divide and conquer the Pope is not
[1:05:27] saying peace when he does this right
[1:05:30] he's saying divide and conquer
[1:05:32] all right that's why you don't want a
[1:05:34] you know peace brother
[1:05:36] yeah divide and conquer and that's what
[1:05:38] he did right here because remember there
[1:05:40] was no denomination anywhere around here
[1:05:42] now there was denominational ideas but
[1:05:46] there was no Methodist Baptist
[1:05:47] Presbyterian right that happened right
[1:05:51] in this time of this man anointing this
[1:05:56] black horse riding Satan said I'll just
[1:05:58] kill him while there while they're alive
[1:06:03] remember the Bible says a woman sees
[1:06:05] she's dead while she's living what is a
[1:06:07] woman his church the church is dead the
[1:06:10] church is dead
[1:06:11] they think they're alive but they're
[1:06:13] dead they took a Creed instead of the
[1:06:18] Word of God now I want to read you a
[1:06:21] couple of things right here because
[1:06:22] brother Branham he stopped go to number
[1:06:25] four on the third seal I'm just going to
[1:06:29] cover this and then we'll stop won't
[1:06:31] take too long today cuz they want to
[1:06:33] cover something next
[1:06:34] a little bit longer skip through there
[1:06:39] you go down the third seal now what
[1:06:41] we're doing is is remember we've got to
[1:06:43] make Redemption fit into all this
[1:06:46] and then it's not just a horse rider
[1:06:49] riding it's not just black and the white
[1:06:50] in the red
[1:06:51] maybe we read the quote that's the seal
[1:06:53] that's what was sealed up the man
[1:06:55] couldn't see and then when that seals
[1:06:58] broke though it does one thing it shows
[1:07:02] you the complete plan of redemption no
[1:07:05] one has ever had the complete plan of
[1:07:07] redemption at their disposal till today
[1:07:11] no one amen and now we find out that
[1:07:16] these mysteries are supposed to be
[1:07:17] revealed and why didn't these other men
[1:07:20] Wesley Luther and those great reformers
[1:07:22] who brought out justification
[1:07:23] sanctification the Pentecostal age with
[1:07:26] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:07:27] things
[1:07:27] why didn't he catch these messages why
[1:07:32] didn't they get them because they were
[1:07:34] reformers just like take it on the other
[1:07:38] side there was people come in who was
[1:07:40] had power as kings but wasn't Kings see
[1:07:44] see you have to notice the Bible
[1:07:46] terminology of anything now watch but
[1:07:49] these the reason that all these stray
[1:07:51] ends of the mysterious part about
[1:07:56] justification so it's not just
[1:07:59] justification there's a mysterious part
[1:08:01] behind it the mysterious part of
[1:08:05] sanctification and the mysterious part
[1:08:08] of the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:08:09] you know what the mysterious part of the
[1:08:10] baptism the Holy Ghost and not just you
[1:08:12] got to wholly go because you cannot the
[1:08:16] whole goes without the seal but you
[1:08:19] can't have all these virtues working in
[1:08:24] your life truly without that and that's
[1:08:30] the same man that's down here but that
[1:08:32] what don't what brother Brown say seals
[1:08:34] it in seals you as a unit what steps out
[1:08:38] into that middle realm that memories and
[1:08:41] conscious affects an imagination and
[1:08:42] lets God brother Brown said fill me up
[1:08:45] Lord fill me up Lord
[1:08:48] well brother Brown you're full of the
[1:08:49] Holy Ghost fill me up Lord I need more
[1:08:53] there's a mysterious part Martin Luther
[1:08:57] brought justification but there's a
[1:09:00] mysterious part that we've been talking
[1:09:02] about right here that those who he's
[1:09:06] justified he's already glorified amen
[1:09:09] those who he's justified he's already
[1:09:11] glorified the mysterious part of
[1:09:13] sanctification what that you can be a
[1:09:16] sanctified vessel that God can what what
[1:09:19] we just well we just read a couple of
[1:09:21] days a couple of days ago there are a
[1:09:22] couple of Sundays ago well just today
[1:09:25] this morning - we are the blood I don't
[1:09:29] want the blood over my doorpost not
[1:09:33] anymore that worked in the Old Testament
[1:09:35] because it was a blood of substitute
[1:09:38] that when the Death Angel saw it what
[1:09:41] happened was they did what God said God
[1:09:44] said put the blood over the lentil and
[1:09:46] I'll not it didn't do it way with death
[1:09:49] cuz those people died eventually but it
[1:09:53] stopped death amen
[1:09:55] right because those people died in the
[1:09:57] wilderness physically dead they died in
[1:10:00] the wilderness so it didn't stop death
[1:10:01] now what I'm talking about is going to
[1:10:03] stop death in its tracks
[1:10:06] because when the tokens inside of you
[1:10:09] on display amen when the tokens inside
[1:10:13] of you on display there is the devil's
[1:10:15] answer putting it over your doorpost
[1:10:18] swing it on your kids throw it all over
[1:10:21] your car you're just gonna have a mess
[1:10:27] you just gonna have a mess but put that
[1:10:31] life that was in that blood inside you
[1:10:35] put it inside you you know what listen
[1:10:38] let me be real plain if you want your
[1:10:42] children you claim them but you better
[1:10:45] make sure you got the Holy Ghost first
[1:10:47] because you can't apply the token if you
[1:10:49] don't have it as brother Dale said many
[1:10:54] times the way we act in front of our
[1:10:57] kids the kids may not want it for that
[1:11:00] gets you silent and makes you
[1:11:02] squirm a little bit is it the truth have
[1:11:06] we turned them away by telling them its
[1:11:09] do's and don'ts and tell them it's this
[1:11:10] and that
[1:11:11] tell them how God lit your fire oh my
[1:11:17] god lit your fire
[1:11:18] let God do the rest they meant stray
[1:11:23] ends of justification sanctification the
[1:11:25] mysterious part of the baptism hole goes
[1:11:27] then he goes to Eve eating an apple and
[1:11:29] all these things so we see now that
[1:11:33] we've come up to justification the
[1:11:35] mysterious part of sanctification
[1:11:36] because you know what when John Wesley
[1:11:39] came to sanctification under the
[1:11:41] anointing of that age which was under
[1:11:43] the man anointing he knew that something
[1:11:50] had happened I was just reading brother
[1:11:53] Bama I can't remember the quote I was
[1:11:55] looking up but he said you got to know
[1:11:57] something happens to you that are
[1:11:59] sitting here today you got to know where
[1:12:01] you're at you got to know that something
[1:12:03] happened now if you're walking through
[1:12:05] life and the same old stuff is dragged
[1:12:07] just like we're like Bob this morning
[1:12:09] you know if you're still dragging that
[1:12:12] you're the only one that knows it that's
[1:12:17] why it's an individual fare with God you
[1:12:19] go to God and say god this thing's
[1:12:22] bothering me we all have little things
[1:12:26] that bother this things bothering me you
[1:12:28] know what he's honored for you to ask
[1:12:33] because he's not gonna take it away
[1:12:35] unless you ask remember he's a gentleman
[1:12:38] the Holy Ghost of the gentleman he's not
[1:12:39] gonna come and say stop that business
[1:12:42] yeah oh yeah he may give you a
[1:12:43] conviction but until you get ready to
[1:12:46] get rid of it because that unclean
[1:12:48] spirit goes out and you do what I kind
[1:12:51] of like that I think I'll put it back
[1:12:53] you see that to me the mysterious part
[1:12:58] of sanctification is is that God can
[1:13:00] clean your slate totally totally clean
[1:13:04] your slate it by what by the word that
[1:13:06] you hear now not a pass not what's
[1:13:09] coming what's right now
[1:13:11] God is our now God he's not a past God
[1:13:14] we can let people live off the past lord
[1:13:16] of mercy things that happened 40 years
[1:13:18] ago so what big deal there's a lot of
[1:13:22] water with another bridge and a lot of
[1:13:23] people died so when I bring up what
[1:13:28] happened 40 years ago
[1:13:30] he's a now God if you forgot forgiven of
[1:13:34] that guess what you're the only one
[1:13:35] worried about it I stay my time the
[1:13:38] other day you know what if you worry
[1:13:40] about something that you've asked God to
[1:13:41] forgive you and you truly believe you
[1:13:43] forgive you but he keeps coming back and
[1:13:44] keep coming back you're the only person
[1:13:46] in heaven and in earth that's that even
[1:13:49] those you did that that's right
[1:13:53] so who's the liar it's got a liar No
[1:13:58] Satan's the lighter Satan's one just
[1:14:01] bringing it up to you but look now let's
[1:14:05] take this right here real quick let's
[1:14:09] read the fifth quote here this isn't a
[1:14:10] third seal if you'll notice read the
[1:14:12] third seal brother Brown talks a lot
[1:14:15] about he goes back and reviews all right
[1:14:18] so that's kind of what we're doing a
[1:14:20] little bit today we're going to catch
[1:14:21] everything up and then we'll start next
[1:14:23] Sunday and bringing the meat of it but
[1:14:25] on the third seal my brother Brown is
[1:14:26] beginning to talk now that's what the
[1:14:29] reasons today the revivals that we're
[1:14:31] supposed to have
[1:14:32] we have denominational revivals we
[1:14:34] haven't had a real stirring no no no no
[1:14:38] no sir so he must be pretty adamant no
[1:14:41] no no no no sir you know why because
[1:14:44] he's got Pentecostals that were sitting
[1:14:45] there latter-day people they said all
[1:14:47] this is that this is the great this is
[1:14:49] brother bronson aim guy here yet don't
[1:14:54] think we got revivals we haven't oh
[1:14:57] they've got millions and millions and
[1:14:59] millions of church members but not a
[1:15:01] revival no we're no no the bride hasn't
[1:15:05] had a revival yet there's there's been
[1:15:09] no revival there no manifestation look
[1:15:12] now look in his life at the
[1:15:16] manifestation and he said there's no
[1:15:19] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:15:22] yet the whole of the
[1:15:24] that's what I want to see that's why
[1:15:26] when seeing the openings and says what
[1:15:28] look we're looking for it it will take
[1:15:31] those seven unknown thunders back there
[1:15:33] to wake her up again he will send it he
[1:15:39] promised it so it's here it wasn't to
[1:15:44] the group he was preaching to he said
[1:15:46] that already
[1:15:49] so we must believe it's uh something is
[1:15:52] going to have to wake us up and it can
[1:15:55] be no more than the opening of the Word
[1:15:57] of God no make a can be up oh yeah I can
[1:16:00] be a feeling we can go put a tent up we
[1:16:02] have millions of people we can go on
[1:16:04] television and tell the world about all
[1:16:06] these great things and we even have
[1:16:08] signs and wonders but it said it will
[1:16:13] take those seven unknown thunders to
[1:16:16] wake her up what was the Thunder
[1:16:18] remember it was the voice of God when he
[1:16:20] reveals something to you let's don't
[1:16:28] wait on it
[1:16:30] let's become it like the guy that goes
[1:16:34] to the goes over to wherever there in
[1:16:37] the foreign country since I'm looking
[1:16:39] for the Welsh revival and the guy who
[1:16:42] looked at the guy looked to him and said
[1:16:44] you're looking at it he was a one-man
[1:16:46] revival that's what we always do we go
[1:16:49] now when Brooke Colley when he starts
[1:16:52] shouting speaking in tongues we'll have
[1:16:53] a revival and that's probably the truth
[1:16:58] knowing brother Colley since I was a
[1:17:00] little boy but that's not it if we all
[1:17:06] wait for brother Colley to do that he
[1:17:08] may be here a while but why don't you do
[1:17:11] it why don't you say God not fanaticism
[1:17:14] not junk
[1:17:16] but we're coming to the opening of these
[1:17:18] seals I believe the crystal is here you
[1:17:22] I believe the word is here I believe we
[1:17:25] got somebody that can preach it not just
[1:17:27] me everybody is bringing everything up
[1:17:30] the brother last night I heard doing a
[1:17:33] real good job over at the fellowship
[1:17:34] meeting I think people get on the bad
[1:17:36] way
[1:17:37] where it's not just hair and dress and
[1:17:38] closing all that it's it's the meat of
[1:17:41] the word it's something you can choose
[1:17:43] something you can eat because remember
[1:17:46] if he said he would send it and he
[1:17:48] promised he would send it he's gonna
[1:17:50] have somebody here to receive it because
[1:17:52] look God doesn't just spread something
[1:17:54] out like I said before here's Martin
[1:17:57] look I mean here's John yeah Martin
[1:17:59] Luther sitting there just teaching the
[1:18:01] Catholic doctrine away and just teaching
[1:18:04] in the schools and and doing the things
[1:18:07] and I'm sure he's doing his Hail Marys
[1:18:09] and he was he was Catholic he was doing
[1:18:12] he was kissing the Pope no toll or
[1:18:14] whatever he done right but one day one
[1:18:18] day God spoke to his heart and said read
[1:18:21] that one more time he may read it a
[1:18:24] million times he said read that one more
[1:18:26] time and when he read it something
[1:18:28] sparked in his heart and he said that
[1:18:31] just shall live by faith
[1:18:34] and that's what you and I are gonna do
[1:18:35] we're gonna take these things and say
[1:18:36] look that rip that what it's me not the
[1:18:41] wife that rode the horse that white
[1:18:43] righteous church is still here and then
[1:18:46] I'm still washed by the blood and if I'm
[1:18:50] not dead the problem with me is as I
[1:18:52] live Paul said it's not all that liveth
[1:18:57] but Christ that liveth in me now listen
[1:19:01] he I want to work this right he did not
[1:19:07] see the opening of the seal he did not
[1:19:10] could the one for him
[1:19:12] yet he wrote this is what's the paradox
[1:19:15] yet he wrote 80% of the New Testament
[1:19:17] where we get the meaning of the seals
[1:19:18] out of same way with John John was
[1:19:21] getting ready to rise to thunders I got
[1:19:23] a quote I'll read it next Sunday we're
[1:19:25] brother Brown I was trying to find it I
[1:19:26] finally found it on the third seal where
[1:19:30] he said John saw the thunders and was
[1:19:32] getting ready to ride him down so it's
[1:19:35] not something so mysterious that John
[1:19:39] couldn't see the plan and get ready to
[1:19:42] write it down so it wasn't a man or
[1:19:45] seven man our seven voice is like we've
[1:19:48] heard before and all
[1:19:50] other stuff no it's the plan of
[1:19:52] redemption the mysterious part comes up
[1:19:58] and we only look see we just look at
[1:20:01] things oh well God save my soul that's
[1:20:03] fine God save your soul but you know
[1:20:05] what there's a part we have to play in
[1:20:06] this endtime that's why I said this
[1:20:09] third seal is very important because
[1:20:10] remember to me if we typed if we type
[1:20:13] the this ages justification and this
[1:20:17] part of the seal of sanctification then
[1:20:20] the third seal which is what God works
[1:20:23] in threes and he's perfected in threes
[1:20:25] then this church then this seal to me
[1:20:29] shows the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:33] you go look read the third seal and see
[1:20:36] how many times because there's only this
[1:20:39] one time what does it say see if I can
[1:20:43] fund it see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:20:50] the wine now there's a voice it's not
[1:20:55] the man anointing it's not the man it's
[1:20:59] a voice brother Branham said it was the
[1:21:01] lamb he has put a stamp on this seal
[1:21:06] that's why it's important it's only time
[1:21:09] that the voice and I heard a voice in
[1:21:11] the midst of the four beasts say a
[1:21:13] measure of wheat for a penny three
[1:21:14] measures of barley for a penny see thou
[1:21:16] hurt not the oil and the wine now what
[1:21:17] is oil in the Bible Holy Ghost amen oil
[1:21:22] always talked the Holy Ghost in the
[1:21:24] Bible amen and the wines of stimulation
[1:21:26] of Revelation you can only get
[1:21:28] revelation if you got the holy go
[1:21:30] amen so what is it sealed to me this is
[1:21:35] the Holy Ghost seal this is the
[1:21:38] justification seal sanctification seal
[1:21:41] the third seal is the Holy Ghost seal
[1:21:44] and you'll read it several several times
[1:21:50] it was so important that the lamb spoke
[1:21:57] yourself now where does redemption come
[1:22:00] from the lamb the lamb
[1:22:04] is the redeemer revelations 5 he ties
[1:22:08] everything together he brings it right
[1:22:09] out and he says hurt knock the old and
[1:22:13] wine in the darkest time that the
[1:22:19] Catholic Church was getting stronger and
[1:22:20] stronger
[1:22:22] God said hold on a minute I'm gonna fill
[1:22:28] Martin Luther with the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:30] I'm gonna send him out then I'm gonna
[1:22:33] fill John Wesley with the Holy Ghost in
[1:22:35] the morning send him out not saying
[1:22:37] these didn't have the Holy Ghost what
[1:22:38] I'm saying is is this is this was the
[1:22:41] faith of the fathers and it was heading
[1:22:43] down in this direction if I see what I'm
[1:22:45] saying it was heading down this way now
[1:22:46] this is going back to a Reformation but
[1:22:49] it's also a beginning of restoration to
[1:22:52] restore the full word back to where now
[1:22:55] we have it it's in book form we have the
[1:22:59] whole we can hear it on tape
[1:23:00] listen brother Eddie knows one thing for
[1:23:03] sure when we first got the the computer
[1:23:05] that thing was this big just for the
[1:23:08] message you know it was like this and
[1:23:11] daddy would say you put in faith or you
[1:23:13] put in the just shall live by faith and
[1:23:15] you can go cut the grass and come back
[1:23:16] and it's still turning now it's on your
[1:23:20] phone in your pocket I've got the table
[1:23:23] on my wellit's in there I've got the
[1:23:24] whole table if I need to look up a quote
[1:23:26] on my phone don't do it while you're
[1:23:29] driving there's a time for all things
[1:23:34] you know what the Bible but you can look
[1:23:37] up a quote so what now we've but now
[1:23:39] look let's take that before we finish
[1:23:41] right here I want to read one more thing
[1:23:43] let's take that though and we've become
[1:23:45] then a bunch of quoters quotes will kill
[1:23:49] you what will kill you but I've always
[1:23:53] told you and I'm going to tell you one
[1:23:54] more time the essence of this message is
[1:23:58] what we need the essence of the message
[1:24:01] is what we need not the not the exact
[1:24:04] quotes because you you know like I said
[1:24:06] you bring me a quote and I'm bringing
[1:24:07] one that sounds different I said I said
[1:24:10] sounds different but it's not God is not
[1:24:14] confused you and I are confused
[1:24:18] all right let's read this one thing
[1:24:21] because remember we're talking about
[1:24:24] these two Church ages and then we'll
[1:24:26] start back over next Sunday we're
[1:24:27] talking about this church age which is
[1:24:31] what you got the Sardis Ian Sardis and
[1:24:34] in Philadelphia that's what income
[1:24:35] passes if we're if we're paralleling it
[1:24:37] with the seals and we're paralleling the
[1:24:40] seals with the church ages the to church
[1:24:42] ages are right here and that's the
[1:24:44] Sardis and have you ever read let's turn
[1:24:46] to Revelations 3 verse 1 and let's read
[1:24:48] what God told them to do now we're
[1:24:51] coming with you all in the wine we're
[1:24:52] talking back the Holy Ghost all right
[1:24:54] we'll talk about the Holy Ghost in you
[1:25:02] and into the Angel of the Church of
[1:25:05] Sardis write these things says he that
[1:25:06] hath - what 7 spirits of God and the
[1:25:09] Seven Stars no or the sevens there's not
[1:25:13] 7 spirits of God brother Bromstad it's
[1:25:15] the Spirit of God in those seven
[1:25:16] churches messages right
[1:25:18] is that Alright saying ma'am I know that
[1:25:20] word that thou has a name that thou
[1:25:22] liveth and our dead dead sound familiar
[1:25:27] black a name that you're living by dead
[1:25:31] because remember when Martin Luther come
[1:25:33] out of the Catholic Church he still
[1:25:35] baptized in the name of Father Son Holy
[1:25:37] go he still believed in the Trinity but
[1:25:40] that wasn't time for that to be took
[1:25:41] away from but remember thou has the name
[1:25:44] that I'll live us than our dead be
[1:25:46] watchful and strengthen the things which
[1:25:48] remain that are ready to die they will
[1:25:52] go back to black again for I have not
[1:25:54] found thy works perfect before God
[1:25:59] remember therefore how thou has received
[1:26:01] and heard and hold fast and repent if
[1:26:06] therefore thou shalt not watch I will
[1:26:09] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[1:26:12] not know what hour I will come upon thee
[1:26:15] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[1:26:18] which have not defiled their garments
[1:26:21] Luther and they shall walk with me and
[1:26:25] what which is why does the what
[1:26:29] righteousness of the saints if you put
[1:26:31] the scripture
[1:26:31] right right which is the Holy Ghost is
[1:26:34] all right for they are worthy he that
[1:26:38] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:26:40] white raiment type of the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:43] I will not blot out his name out of the
[1:26:45] book of life but I will confess his name
[1:26:48] before my father and before his angels
[1:26:49] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:26:51] the Spirit says into the churches now
[1:26:54] let's go to the Philadelphia heats
[1:26:55] because it is still the age of of the to
[1:26:58] me the third seal and the man anointing
[1:27:01] until the angel the church in
[1:27:03] Philadelphia write these things saith he
[1:27:05] that is holy he that is true he that
[1:27:09] hath the key of David he that openeth
[1:27:12] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[1:27:14] man openeth in other words God is going
[1:27:17] to reveal what he wants to reveal
[1:27:21] starting with that anointing of that age
[1:27:24] I know thy works behold I have set
[1:27:28] before thee an open door you know
[1:27:30] brother ram top set is the missionary
[1:27:31] age ok well I'll you won't that's ok but
[1:27:35] we need to be missionary there's some
[1:27:37] things in my life that I need to get rid
[1:27:39] of hey ma'am I need to be missionary I
[1:27:42] have set before thee an open door no man
[1:27:46] can shut it God opens the door we need
[1:27:52] to realize God has opened the door for
[1:27:57] thou hast a little strength and has kept
[1:28:00] my word and has not denied my name now
[1:28:04] cuz remember look when we come from the
[1:28:06] Philadelphia and when we head into the
[1:28:07] Laodicean Church age right in here is
[1:28:10] when in 1906 in 1912 is when what the
[1:28:14] oneness came out the oneness doctrine of
[1:28:16] you know brother Graham's not to want to
[1:28:17] come up with the oneness doctrine it was
[1:28:19] before he just tied two loose ends up
[1:28:22] and put it all together where it's
[1:28:23] supposed to be because remember when he
[1:28:24] said maybe we had to dream he said I
[1:28:26] took a limb from the Trinity
[1:28:28] I took a limb from the one that's
[1:28:30] planted it and it became a great tree
[1:28:32] right behold I will make them wait a
[1:28:35] minute that's kept my word and that's
[1:28:37] denying my name behold I will make them
[1:28:39] of the synagogue of Satan which say they
[1:28:42] are Jews and are not but do lie
[1:28:44] behold I will make them to come and
[1:28:46] worship before thy feet and to know
[1:28:50] now look God don't love The Devil's kids
[1:28:54] God's loves his kids and to know that I
[1:28:58] have loved thee because thou has kept
[1:29:02] the word of my patience I will also keep
[1:29:05] thee from the hour of temptation which
[1:29:09] shall come upon all the world to try
[1:29:11] them that dwell upon the earth behold I
[1:29:15] come quickly whole-fat that fast which
[1:29:18] thou hast that no man take thy crown him
[1:29:23] that overcometh will i make a pillar in
[1:29:25] the temple of my god and he shall go in
[1:29:28] the more out sounds like somebody's at
[1:29:31] rest right and I will write upon him the
[1:29:34] name of my God the name of the city of
[1:29:37] my god which is New Jerusalem with
[1:29:39] cometh down out of heaven listen the
[1:29:41] only people are gonna see that what
[1:29:43] remember John said this is I see the
[1:29:45] city coming down and it's what looks
[1:29:47] like a bride adorned for a husband with
[1:29:49] a bride is the Holy Ghost filled amen
[1:29:51] and I will write upon him my new name
[1:29:54] he's an ear let him hear what the Spirit
[1:29:56] says to the churches God said I will
[1:30:01] restore and he's starting right here in
[1:30:04] the darkest time when that black horse
[1:30:07] gets on it and he starts riding with his
[1:30:09] denominational ideas God is right there
[1:30:12] doing what he wants to do building a
[1:30:15] church getting it ready got to be two
[1:30:19] shoots you got to be the stock got to be
[1:30:22] the tassel to make the grain cuz you and
[1:30:25] I are not to plant with the grain we're
[1:30:32] the seed we are what was planted amen
[1:30:41] to me that's the mysterious part of the
[1:30:44] Holy Ghost is what the mysterious part
[1:30:46] of the Holy Ghost is is to know exactly
[1:30:48] how to use it you so long use it yes
[1:30:53] know exactly how to use it
[1:30:55] just listen to what brother Branham said
[1:30:57] before we close right here brother
[1:30:59] Branham goes out in Arizona and he has a
[1:31:01] vision of a sword right in his hand he
[1:31:08] said it fit me perfect typing the sword
[1:31:10] being the word and fitting him perfect
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:14] but you know what he also said people
[1:31:16] don't people don't talk about the rest
[1:31:18] of the of the vision because he goes out
[1:31:21] of the vision and he starts making a
[1:31:22] comment brother Branham said it takes
[1:31:24] the strong arm of faith to take it to
[1:31:28] the heart of the enemy not that you just
[1:31:30] got the sword you know you set up in you
[1:31:32] wave a sword all you won't do but if
[1:31:35] you're not worthy if you don't know how
[1:31:38] to use it a real good swordsman will
[1:31:42] take that sword away from you and kill
[1:31:43] you but a strong hand of faith knowing
[1:31:46] how to use the word it's what we come to
[1:31:50] here because look in the blackness of
[1:31:52] Satan riding that black horse with a
[1:31:53] balance everything is balanced
[1:31:55] everything's got to be weighed not Wade
[1:31:58] Wade
[1:31:59] everything's got to be w AI GA CD I went
[1:32:04] to veins can wade and that's what we're
[1:32:07] doing now you're weighing now whether
[1:32:09] you want to go on with this or just yeah
[1:32:10] well this is just another sermon okay
[1:32:13] something's got a spark
[1:32:15] something's got a spark if it's not
[1:32:18] sparking I don't know I can't save you I
[1:32:24] can just tell you what God's already
[1:32:26] saying and in that that third seal that
[1:32:30] to me is that mysterious part of the
[1:32:32] Holy Ghost is how to use it when you got
[1:32:34] it to me that's just a hole we can paint
[1:32:38] the building any color you won't do it's
[1:32:40] just how to use it because you know what
[1:32:43] a baby with a gun is disastrous right
[1:32:50] brother branham said
[1:32:53] power without character power without
[1:33:02] character it's satanic but power with
[1:33:07] character is to know how to use the
[1:33:09] sword let's stab it's to know how to use
[1:33:11] that sword there's no high any situation
[1:33:14] we listen we hear all these testimonies
[1:33:16] of how God's done things for people
[1:33:18] that's a god thing that's something
[1:33:21] God's done for his children and I don't
[1:33:24] want to say this in light but God's not
[1:33:27] taking care of the Devils kids they've
[1:33:30] made their choice yeah they've made
[1:33:32] their choice so in making their choice
[1:33:35] they don't get the promises of God but
[1:33:39] you being a child of God you get the
[1:33:41] promises of God so if you got the Holy
[1:33:46] Ghost learn how to use those promises
[1:33:47] and that's what we do I believe every
[1:33:51] Sunday I learn how to use what I've
[1:33:53] already got I'll learn how to use what
[1:33:56] I've already got and then that's what
[1:33:58] you can read you're not gonna do we come
[1:34:00] up to this third seal we got to know how
[1:34:02] to use what God's already give us so
[1:34:06] there's no new message there's not a
[1:34:08] different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy
[1:34:10] Ghost in every church age but it's the
[1:34:12] amount of word that they had to use you
[1:34:15] and I don't have an excuse because our
[1:34:17] books open any promise that God has in
[1:34:25] there you need to take a hold of it you
[1:34:30] need to be able to use it you saw I'm
[1:34:32] not a minister I'm not of this that's
[1:34:36] just a title that's just a title the
[1:34:40] only gift difference in me and you is is
[1:34:42] I got a little bit of a gift maybe to
[1:34:44] put something together so that God can
[1:34:45] speak to you but it's not me talking to
[1:34:47] you it's God God's gonna have to give
[1:34:50] you something because you know we've
[1:34:52] listened to a dissertation and many
[1:34:58] things that were not true that were
[1:35:00] false but now how many times though have
[1:35:04] you said in a in a place and you heard
[1:35:06] something
[1:35:06] wrong and some little something that
[1:35:12] right boy if that's never happened to
[1:35:15] you
[1:35:17] you need to let it happen to you one
[1:35:19] time because they don't puff you up it
[1:35:22] makes you so humble to know that God has
[1:35:24] said hey I'm protecting you don't go
[1:35:28] that way
[1:35:29] don't do that hey hey you're a son of
[1:35:32] mine don't do that
[1:35:33] amen see none of that then then what do
[1:35:36] we do we go soaked over in the corner oh
[1:35:38] my goodness no you say thank you God
[1:35:40] thank you God thank you that I didn't
[1:35:44] have to do that
[1:35:45] thank you for hitting me off at the pass
[1:35:47] that's how you then you know what take
[1:35:50] that and the next time Satan brings it
[1:35:52] you go already got a awards for that
[1:35:57] I've got a t-shirt don't want that no
[1:35:59] more all right so that's what we got to
[1:36:02] do when we talk about these seals it is
[1:36:05] a mysterious part cuz you know what the
[1:36:06] world can't understand how that there's
[1:36:10] something except just believe in God
[1:36:13] sure this all starts that way but you
[1:36:15] got to you got to see that that God has
[1:36:19] listened he decided to come down in
[1:36:23] human flesh he decided then to come back
[1:36:26] into baptism the Holy Ghost into your
[1:36:28] flesh and made all the provisions that
[1:36:31] you need you know what our problem is
[1:36:34] though we say no that's enough I don't
[1:36:37] want any more of that all right that
[1:36:39] would require me to study amen
[1:36:45] our problem is our problem amen sing us
[1:36:50] a song brother these young guys and
[1:36:53] young sisters are doing a wonderful job
[1:36:55] give my hand
[1:37:01] we like to let them participate because
[1:37:03] you know what if we get older they're
[1:37:06] the ones going to take over so Lord
