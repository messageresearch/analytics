name thank God for your faith and for the mercies of God Amen that has kept us together that's right I'd like you to turn your Bibles to the book of s to John 12 I'm going to read from verse 20 then I'm going to read also from Revelation chapter 10 and verse 8 we we're certainly uh know that this is a final day yes amen amen and if this is a final day there's got to be a final call final message there's got to be a voice amen uh and that has got to be the the voice of God we're not talking about the voice of politics or you know Commerce or but we talk about the voice of God Amen for this time that we're we're living in amen praise God so we find it may just bow our heads every everywhere our gracious God and our father Lord we come to you believing you God the Lord is the Bible declare you're a rewarder of them that diligently seek you and Lord God we seek you God through your word in this day because Lord God we know that you've got an answer for every question you've got a word for every life and Lord God to place Us positionally in the Kingdom of almighty God that Lord God we can be assured of our position on this side of glory amen Lord we we know that every time that

unfailing word and then Lord God we will see you and Lord God may you reveal to us oh God the answer to that which we stand in need of bless every heart and Lord God we pray that you'd move us out of the way that you can be seen remove the distraction Lord God that is in the flesh that Lord God in the spirit the spiritual revelation of your word might come forth to your children bless us now as we look to you and believe you in Jesus name we pray amen amen and amen in St John 12 and verse 20 and the Bible says and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which was of beta of Galilee and desire him saying sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and tell Andrew and again Andrew and philli tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of weed fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit amen then over in verse 28 he said father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again amen the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thunder y other say an angel spake to him Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sake now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me you may be seated as we go to the next scripture this morning from Revelation chap 10 and we know that very well on verse 8 Revelation 10:8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hands of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take take it and eat it up and it shall be make thy belly bitter but it shall be thy mouth sweet as hone and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and nation and tongues and Kings amen I want you to note that the prophecy is going to be not to a a nation M but before many people and the nation and tongues and Kings therefore it's got to be a Gentiles amen so I speak this morning on that final voice to that final age and I know we believe this morning that we're at the end of all things everything is coming to an end exactly you know you you look at politics and you find that the world is as it were falling AP part by its economy right amen you know we find that even though in America it seems like the economy is stable then when you look at Hallelujah the deficit that they've got you realize this nation is in trouble the entire world is in trouble and when we look even among ourselves the message of the hour mean we we can see those prophecies coming to us all that can be shaken will be shaken amen that there are things today being said that affect the very core of the people's Faith causing them to question the word of God question the foundation that they stand upon that's right and may I quickly say that if you don't have the new birth if you're not standing on the foundation of the word of God what you're standing upon will be shaken amen as trying to question the things that we have seen and heard as a Vindication of our faith yeah amen but God knows exactly what he's doing in the letter in church age 364 brother Bram said it is harvestin and the two vines that grow together and intertwine their branch is now being separated oh hallelujah amen the fruit of these Vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate garam the two spirits will go to their separate destination now is the time to make the final call that comes only to the wheat bride that's right the final call is to the bride of Christ and the Word was come out of her my people and be separate that you partake not of our sins Glory you know that final call is going to be to the bride amen you know the Bible says that amen when the word of God comes it comes in lightning in voices and in Thunder amen but we find that every time it happens in the scripture the true seed of God they did not hear thund what they heard was a voice yet the others all they heard was a thunder only Thunder but there is with the Thunder a voice of understanding right hallelujah amen and that voice of understanding can only come to them that have years to hear that years to years come by the new birth Hallelujah which the bride must receive amen right amen hallelujah amen the people heard thunder and today you know the question is uh mean why is it that we go back after so many years and question the foundation of the FI that's right you know why because yes to them there was a thunder mhm that caused a move of God are you there with me but there was not the voice of God with certainty to them but they can stand upon that right hallelujah amen brother bam said when a man struck an absolute he gives him a Vindication of that are you there with me amen every one of us here this amen this morning you've got to have a Vindication of your Fai it's not something on the outside that that is place there said by that no it is by this this is what I'm standing upon amen I appreciate all of that that brought me to a position Hallelujah but the word of God is n thee right and so we find this at the baptism of Jesus they hear a noise but not the voice of God are you there with me the Greeks it wasn't their time because the corn of wheat did not fall into the ground and die so all they heard was a thunder right amen but the voice came to the elect the people prepared at the time amen if you read acts 9 the the account of Paul amen Acts chapter 22 and Acts 26 uh you get amen you know from the Greek what it says they said and they heard the voice but did not understand or they they see the light but understand all the voice but when they run it back it says they heard the the noise but heard not the voice to them it was merely a noise because it was not God's voice to them because the voice of Revelation they had nothing to receive it right are you there with me so the elect will hear the voice of God hallelujah in our day the Thunder speaks in Revelation 10 ibody believe that Revelation 107 to many it's just still a thunder all the prophet says you know they go back and take the literal word line for line and they try to make that match with history yeah they're trying to get a Vindication out of the literal words are you there oh but even Jesus telling in the volume of the book it is written of me hallelujah amen amen yes the thunder sound how many believe that amen but there was a truth to that seven Thunder in the message what attraction on the mountain brother bam said he said what happened upon upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word right right amen hallelujah he said that's what all the noise is about yeah right amen notice is God Hall fulfilling his promised word again of Revelation 10 1-7 right and in the days of the voice of the seven Thunder when it shall begin to sound the m of God should be finished amen that's right therefore it's saying that in the days of Revelation 3:14 the mystery of God will be completed are you there with me amen hallelujah now the last message to the lasten church age fulfill exactly in this age he said that's right in Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man is R amen hallelujah and in that time there shall arise false prophet amen because if you take the words of a Vindicated prophet and you begin to question that word amen it makes you a false prophet amen where is your Vindication if you can say well the prophet was wrong here but he was right here where is your Vindication you Hallelujah and there shall be Falls anointed ones yes sir who the people will have great respect for amen but when it comes down to the aligning of your faith they question what God says right Hallelujah he said it would deceive the very elect if it was possible Hallelujah yet many around message Circle are still puzzled wondering It Rock their fate Hallelujah me people are in disarray but I tell you what everything that can shake right will shake in this name yes sir amen amen and if your faith is on is not on Solid Rock it will shake amen amen right amen now the sounding of the seven Thunder which the in mystery of God of Revelation 10 1-7 still remain thunder in Thunder form to those who have not ears to hear right amen hallelujah but that sounding is not for everybody that's right it's for those amen that must Echo the final voice are you there with me right hallelujah amen now God the prophet says the seven Thunder word message is only for the bride and she will be the final voice in the final hour that's right amen amen yes sir Glory it comes to the church ages it sounding and in each age there was a message for that age that's righten and the Bride of that age was caught up by the revelation of the word the portion of the word for their day amen hallelujah amen but yet there was an inhal of of that in each age that was left off amen hallelujah amen amen but we we know that in the time of the seventh angel message all the mystery yeah of Ephesus of Perma ofia all that mystery is going to be finished hallelujah amen amen with the opening of The Seven Seals he will bring now the Eternal voice amen of God are you there with me Hallelujah into creative existence that's right hallelujah amen because Brethren if it's a voice of God it's got to be the creative word of God amen amen hallelujah bringing back the creative authority of that word that was spoken come on Amen yes sir hallelujah amen and that if that creative word is spoken again in power Hallelujah then it's going to be a manifestation Hallelujah of the original word that was spoken in Genesis and when it was spoken there it bring forth of its kind and if it's spoken now it's going to bring forth of its kind amen hallelujah amen but it couldn't come until a prophet step on the scene brother B said a prophet Hallelujah is not only a Seer but he's a revealer of the word of God that is written in his life amen amen Amen brother way that is written in his life right yes therefore brother BR standing there and speaking things of his life right the word of God is written in his life God gives them experiences that you when you read it Hallelujah it is pointing your back to that abstract the word of God yes sir on the first seal page 1552 he said then he said we found out what the thunder means right hello and if he says that would you would you take it amen hallelujah that's perfectly we know that see the Thunder was a voice of God when the seals openen does that need interpretation it is a voice of God so the bride will accept it as the voice not of a man but the voice of God hallelujah yes sir amen hallelujah the revelation of Jesus Christ page 116 paragraph 55 55 I think he said when the true anointing of God speaks it is the voice of God are you there with me amen so we know what the Thunder is it is the voice of God but move it from that he said knowing the true anointing speak right hello right amen when the minister stand there with the true anointing Hallelujah that is a voice of God don't put it just on the prophet no sir but if that same anointing speak truth it is a voice of God to reject it right is to remove the Candlestick amen right and if you remove your Candlestick you've got no light right that's right so the path becomes blur right and if the path becomes blur then the people is in darkness and if the people is in darkness again the Bible said if the truth be hid it is it to them who are lost of whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not hallelujah amen amen continue to quote he said the voice of the seven chch changed the voice speaking with thunder and lightning Hallelujah in the seventh seal 1963 notice there was only one great burst of thunder and seven angels appear right is that right one burst of thunder seven angels appear and I saw the lamb when he open the first seal and I heard as it were the voice of thunder and one of the four Beast the comat Beast which is the anointing Hallelujah that brings it to bring it to John come and see notice one Thunder seven message messages that means sealed up and cannot be revealed until the last day y right he said in this age am amen you're in the day of the opening Hallelujah if they're questioning whether or not it's open you are in the day of the opening amen Hallelujah that's right so today we've got to have a a a clear understanding of the word of God that's your new birth can I say that because the Bible say youve got no need an your teacher that is a clear understanding amen when the word comes forth under the anointing it struck something that is there if there's nothing there the word goes to your head then you can reason that word you can quot what what the prophet says you can tell somebody what he said oh but except it dropped down it can't become spiritual Revelation amen yes sir Hallelujah the the messenger of sound we have found the anointing of the spirit of the Prophet amen but now that anointing it did not stand with the prophet it is upon the bride amen and the same creative Authority that Adam lost now you you've got to come to that point that the word of God is a creative word right amen amen amen is a right and if if brother Bram speak the perfect word of God right that must have been the same word that Adam speak then Paul said to you the word of God is n thee even in thy mouth so where is that word this morning amen hallelujah so we can say then we have found what Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden are you with me oh hallelujah we're going somewhere this morning if if we talk about all that Authority that Adam had that Dominion that he had now if we found the same thing that he had what is that word supposed to do with you and I amen amen amen hallelujah right brother bam shows in the turp the creative authority of the word and he said he said Abraham never asks for a around right hello right but in that Union God provided it it's not what brother Bram wanted right right but God comes on the scene are you there with me that brings the third pull right the third pull is not you it is him performing his work but that work has going to come through you oh the recipient of the word oh I preach a message hallelujah amen agents by adoption because because of your adoption you become an agent of God are you there with me and everything is invested in you GL hallelujah amen yes sir now we truly are shown full restoration spiritually back to the Garden of Eden am full restoration that's where the bride is going and if the spoken word was the original seed then the spoken word is the Original Seed if the spoken word is what was planted then the spoken word is going to be at the Harvest side right amen hallelujah may I say this 2,000 years old bride body because there was a bride coming out of age out of every age are you there with me but they without us could not be made complete why because of the element that was left off right but you know with a full restoration of the word is bringing all these elements together are you there with me that's for a purpose am exactly oh yes hallelujah it's going to take us somewhere amen only show us a Christ himself the token life as by God's creative Authority bring the entire bride's body oh Hallelujah back to its feet again what is it it's aiping power right Glory BR said Hallelujah now is a time of Separation hallelujah it's bringing the bride body together amen but as a bride body begins to close knit together there is a separation yes sir because that which is not a part of though it might be the same assemble it might listen to the same word it's going to be separated that two spirit in the framework of the Christian Church sir hallelujah oh you got to know your position you got to be certain of God Amen am I with you right hallelujah amen this quickening power is bringing now their Awakening that's right of the Bride amen oh you said brother King was she always awake no when the squeeze comes on when these things come in the midst to challenge your faith amen then you're going to stand up something Hallelujah s John 14:20 in that day you will know right oh Hallelujah yeah it was always there but when this comes then you know that you're standing on Solid Rock amen amen amen hallelujah oh he said it's going to take stronger wind than this to move me from my promises hallelujah amen amen because I have not men's person in admiration right right are you there with me oh brother B said man will feel yep is that right amen and creation is always original God is not doing a rerun God is not doing a rework are you there with me right no know sir God is using an original creation are you there with me amen and I thank God for the perfect birth amen are you there hall for God's cry first in Eden Hallelujah then in the end time hallelujah amen Let There Be and the Bible says and there was Hallelujah the whole nature is not whitewashed no sir but it said the Holy Fire of God literally burn out all the whole and the life of Christ make us brand new creatures brand new creation in Christ Jesus I am not what I was in Baptist you're not what you were in Pentecost you're not what you were in church across are you there with me all that has got to go because when we come to it we take everything with us and that is our own exper we hung to it but all that has got to go Paul said that I might know Christ it's not what I had at the feet of gel but that I might know him and that the power of his resurrection might rest upon me amen right the spoken word is the Original Seed amen he said now that's why we believe it that is in the word of God therefore God's spoken word is original you believe that exactly sure what we get from the pulpit is got to be original am exactly it's got to be fresh amen hallelujah amen a fresh kill every Sunday morning I not the old manner of yesterday Hallelujah but a fresh anointing the fresh kill that's what the Eagles stay amen not something that died and UNR Hallelujah no no no that's a vulture amen but we have Jehovah's Eagle amen hallelujah he said therefore God's spoken word is original and everything that God created in other words spoken to existence is original and you can IBD some of his creation secondarily secondarily you can I bre that if somebody tells you you can take that and do anything with it but if it comes from the mind of God it cannot be ibr right amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah oh if it's from some camp that that somebody put a cool of thought a a doctrine of the word of God me that can be I bre but the original word of God cannot be I bre thank you Lord hallelujah that's right your true birth cannot be ibr that's why Christ The Mystery of God revealed the womb of life is sealed you don't have to fear false Doctrine if youve got the new birth right oh the true birth Hallelujah he said that's the reason Eve could do what she did Hallelujah with her Horn Seed because she wasn't in the original creation Hallelujah if what you've got is dwelling on somebody else's experience that can be ibr hello that's right come on I've got to meet the man I've got to meet oh hallelujah oh Jesus yeah amen that burning bush for myself brother said every man that's what he's

have met almighty God he tell you must be born again amen hallelujah amen in the church age 3:36 now but now he's standing in the midst of the church right as he stand there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the auor of the creation of God Amen and auor means to bring something out of nothing right right it is not plagarized right it is not taking secondary Hallelujah Knowledge from somebody and putting it together hallelujah it's original am amen this is another this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself not another himself he's a creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride oh I like that amen the bridegroom created his own bride amen hallelujah amen so the f the spoken word then has got to bring Hallelujah the final cry the seven th the sounding sounding of our Prophet brings the token Life of Christ into full manifestation in the bride amen are you there with me the the word if the word is creative and the word comes in you then the word is going to create in you and the only thing the word can create is a creative Authority with a full manifestation of Jesus Christ amen it cannot create another person because everything eight times in Genesis everything bring forth of its kind so if what's in you is God then it's going to create God amen amen you with me amen don't look at your fry take your eyes of yourself look at him because as we look at him we being changed in that same image Hallelujah yes oh so he create his bride and he marries her Hallelujah then she becomes pregnant with his seed and she brings forth Hallelujah Oh Glory oh I was reading this morning brother Bram said for we have The Offspring of God Amen adoption we we The Offspring of God oh your DNA comes from God are you there with me oh he said this inheritance he didn't come down to give it to us it is yours because the birth is or original hallelujah amen amen we have become more and more aware that the written word was only to lay a foundation to bring the life of Jesus Christ which is a token to the believer amen amen corre there it is the written word but it was for purpose to bring the life of God amen amen to the believer hallelujah amen from out of that life would flow rivers of Living Waters amen hallelujah spoken word anointing comes out of you right not only sand de or we de no not only preachers no of you shall come Hallelujah that anointing are you there with me and we are the generation chosen amen for every promise in scripture both in the Old Testament and the new oh he said it point to Christ but if it point to Christ this is the bright coming of Christ coming out of the church what form is he in now he's in bright form exactly that's right amen huj can you see your position can you look to it this is the rising of the sun it's risen up in you this morning hallelujah oh God is found a Dwelling Place amen yes sir amen and manifestation and proving Hallelujah to Heaven and Earth that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's us this Bride for we are the that cast The Shadow are you with me Hallelujah we now is a him we are in
