========================================

and here we see though that I try to see the boys and being turned I saw seven golden count sticks and in the myth the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt are covered about the path which is up here with a golden girl everybody got that so in symbolic form the Son of Man being tied to a woman he's dealing the son of man but his bodily form on earth is a female alright which is us because there's the bride and all this because he said I am my alpha now watch what he says I am Alpha and Omega welcome begin the Alpha church age Christ had just left because it started in 1853 left in 1830 so he was there in physical son of man form starting the Terr days and then down here in the in town now we know for sure he's not going to come back in physical form but he is so physical in a variety that River flows so good that we can see that we are an extension we're not another son of man we are the son of man made manifest on the earth as a whole he was one man here it's a mini membered body here to culminate and to and to make all this they're waiting on us as brother Dale says these people are not complete without us that's why brother Lansing God's not complete without you it's not that God is standing there was not a piece of him missing no he needs to be able to flow in his fullness he needed a Adam I don't with the whole man but there's no way he can reproduce itself zero away the way God wanted it done so he had to take a female make a female to do like what girl Aaron been talking about well then talking about couple weeks ago it took a female to receive seed to begin the progeny our protein procreation same time with Aaron a pickoffs 100 little jesus's were born within all these church ages there's honey thousands of little Jesus's that what's happened see it's not the loins of man's the Word of God spoken word is original see all right but this man is standing now there's no there is no revelation of the Son of Man he set for himself and in the end time then I got that there's no there was no revelation of the Son of Man during church ages it was the son of God a spirit the spirit part of God the Holy Ghost while you come at last night Michael thought that Michael that's Michael the Archangel which was Christ in a form to fight with Satan in heaven before he came down here and got got a body named Jesus okay potentially he was that like brother Brown said melchizedek become Jesus Christ what Moses saw walk by him in the Old Testament was the theophany of the man that entered the baby in 8 and BC set bc4 to be Jesus Christ God Almighty in human flesh everybody got that pretty pretty simple okay but John turns to see and he's heard Jesus's voice forever I mean for a three and a half years he heard him every day so he kind of knew who the person was but he sees him in a form that he's that he has a Girton has a girdle up here that covers his past so like you know you keep watching what brother Brown says you went on the shoulder means something one around the waist means something that's different when you when the judge or whoever walked in the court and they put a sack it's kind of like connector on the Catholic Church does and graduation you see these the regular people graduating they had just a regular but you see these with the red ribbon same way with the Catholics and same way with you see if somebody has a doctorate degree and they walk up on the stage you see if somebody walks up is noticing today the Georgia State Patrol has something on the in the paper and the captain doesn't wear the thing I feel like the army they have the Stars up here for the army they wear theirs right here so you can see and identify that this guy was a pretty high ranking because he had four days for Starla's received it those assembled to tell you what this person is and what position he has so the position that God took through the church ages was female a bride he was bringing a bride to fruition by becoming the Son of God entering into the people but they would all die then it would be a new group come then they would all died and then they've been new group comes and it all die but in the end time being the outsider Omega he comes in the end time prophet brings a message and we see clearly like we were talking about last night the Book of Revelations start talking to a nominal person about the book of Revelation they will dispute the expression if they weren't a drinker that started drinking because they done you just do not you know well Jesus saved my soul let's talk about revelations for revelation what do you mean I thought there's too many of this and that like brother Adam even said you got told he said you know John must have had a three pepper supper of them out before when he was saying what he was having indigestion bad dreams but it's clearly stated that join was derived what he saw and send it to these churches and the churches are supposed to take it but like I said last night each one of these Church ages they lived that anointing and never knew they were in church eight forward church a three Iranians never stood up and said I'm church age messenger number three no he had an anointing for the time preached this sermon and the men are the people took that anointing and took it out to the church right Columba even like I said before Colombo passed away before the church age even started but church age is not just the seven stars it's the people it's not it is seven men that begins it but it's not seven men they just and that's all God used them because we're going to see right here that they were in right handy at seven stars and out of his mouth was a two-edged sword what he came through those seven men and she has another thing you start going by denomination people you start talking about putting me in these position and they'll just ridicule you today oh yeah oh yeah even though lugar it's definitely the founder of the Lutheran doctrine why they call it blueprint and they'll still tell you now that was just something that came up I thought to him before John Wesley oh yeah he's a Methodist but see then you got Wesleyan ISM you got all these different things that comes out of it but like brother Graham said the man comes on the scene preaches the pure message of God when he leaves the scene it just becomes chaos because the man's not there and and then the people taking so I stand Blucher told us to kill all the priests no Luther was saying you need to kill the doctrine this in the priests you know but they they took the extreme same thing with brother ground same thing happened all down through there I mean the messenger goes off the same that's when Satan gets in listen the devil's been here almost as long as God's been here because God created him first so the devil's been here through that all this and he's not standing down here at the end of the age going no he knows what he wants to do okay he wants to get rid of us because he keeps standing there going on I don't know where they went I don't believe the devil's ever seen the snakes dimension I don't think God lets him roam around in that sixth dimension no way that's just for the people that are mourning him - brother Graham said the only thing here is perfect love and same thing there so that states dimension when somebody dies it's like I've always said before he the Death Angel comes to pick them up and this white light comes into room Michael comes in and goes yeah this one's mine where are you gonna take them thought you were talking about last night there's a Satan has a railing accusation against Michael in the book Jews and the Jews Jude one where Satan is disputing where Moses go and in other words my bullet Damon said ain't not your business just not really any of your business this one's mine and he takes them into the sixth dimension and then Satan says I before their ad but I know where mine are you know so he's trying to gather his subjects what's the Bible says in that other dimension but just just realize one thing for sure God has took this these seven Church ages and he has protected a group of people I mean totally protected that group of people that died under their church age messenger all right all the way up to today alright we which are alive and remain so we are here we are the week and I want to miss the silicon go count stays 1 lakh into the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps were going girl he's having his hair with white like wool yeah well I like wall why snow and what brother I say that was judgment remember the big one the one that put on the wig that's divine judgment it's heroin by his hair was white like wool Jesus not an old man darn ain't never had gray hair come on that's even God's never been old if God's old we're in trouble because we're supposed to be made in His image okay I I just don't think he's an old man there with white with white hair now like I said before if you watch some of the Old English over in Britain when they come into the court the judges got that white wig on right which brother Branham says that's being a judge he's judgment some of their watch so what a judge you saw that's that Christ no wait a minute he's in bright form right here he's not in father form you understand what I mean he's then son of man form are coming down through the bride because the Bible says that the Saints will judge so the judgments going to be through me in you listen the first church age yeah they're gonna be judged by Jesus Christ but they're gonna be Paul should you be judged what I found what I said Irene yes he never probably said it before but he probably come to a realization that man or somebody did and said hey that message he's preaching is a truth and i'm coming i'm gonna be judged if I don't receive that I'm gonna be judged so guess what when you get some walking on judgement it's not just one God standing there with the books it says Thrones brother Graham said we'll all be standing around the judgement judge why because we are the ones that God's gonna judge the people is it's by the character of the bride and that adage miss harris wise wolf and his eyes flame of fire he speed liking the fine brass with runs to different divine judgment and if they burned in the furnace and his voice as the sound of many people waters his people all right the sound of many people while ago this many members body alright he's describing the whole bride he's really not describing Jesus Christ he's describing the bride what the characteristic of the bride is because Jesus himself the body man's not coming until this is finished and we're all over here in the end the millennium okay so one evening bride for him but it's his form it's the form he chose today and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went what the word the two-edged sword the word the word is what's going to do the judgment and its countless was that the sunshine that's any strength to man him and he just you know shine from through he'll butter cake and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and these ladies around hand upon meats there unto me fear not I am the first in the last I am he that liveth and was dead now that can't be the Holy Ghost or the father that had to be Jesus the Savior comes he not any baby not he's literally that body was they brother Brown said it laid cold in the grave for 48 hours or longer yet laid in that tomb dead and it would have corrupted had not the scripture told him that he could raise back up within the three days I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore and have the keys of hell and of death all right so you've got the teeth of Helen of death write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter in other words write what you're seeing them what you do and then the things which shall be Hereafter what's now the same things which are things with Speer after the mystery know us he tells us the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou saw it in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks now the seven stars are the angels are messengers of the seven churches now no one knew John penned this in 1896 and then we say ended Interscope 1896 John penned is the seven stars were not revealed though until this man came and God revealed who the stars were Co seven stars of the seven angels are the angels of the seven churches which then he revealed all the seven churches put the dates in when they started when he when they stopped right and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches there's only going to be seven churches okay there's Bible you can't make no difference now we'll start right here just for a second then we'll back up next week until the angel or unto the messenger of the Church of Ephesus write don't you notice them now Jesus told us he's the Alpha and Omega right all right is that true now let me borrow I think it only on 14 all right if you don't have your Bible listen to this now it was alpha no media all right first and the last so the first message the first message and the last message one wants to bring the church ages then one was to usher it out right so they have a common denominator but what your Bible says to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus okay write these things then he goes and says to the angel of the church in Smyrna to the angel so he's got to come to the angel for every one of them for the Angel of the Church of Philadelphia the Angel of the Church of the Lamb since it's always to the messenger first come to the angel to the angel to the angel first so I want you to see this guy to me according to the Bible I don't care what the people and their believe I'm coming message people that are well non message people that are believing that brother Brown went to several church a messenger that's okay but there's got to be one right or the Bible's not completely because God has go has to go to the angel our messenger of this church ditional edition listen listen listen to this one that's why they got that out of the whole Bible or take it if no there's no picking at you there's no picking and choosing because you're gonna go simple look he said in the first chapter it was that this was the beginning this was the beginning I am the Alpha and Omega the first and the left this church age started with God giving a message to an angel to deliver to the church then this message right here don't matter who they whose name they put in there there's got to be a seventh person come in this end time and God's got to give him a message and then he's going to take that message and give it to the church are the whole Bible Trump just throw out the Book of Revelations because that's the whole basis why did God put it in brother Brown said it was put in divine order it was the last book of the Bible and each one of these he's talked to the churches first he identified who he was if you've been reading your revelation of Jesus Christ he's identifying who he is first and where he is he's Alpha 2 mega heard about the top so he sends feminist son of man bride for him and he's going to give a message he's gonna give a message to a messenger and that messenger is going to give the message to the people now that's from here all the way through any can't get about right here and go wait a minute this ain't working no it's work that's right that's why he made it that way so whatever started here I don't care for you I really don't care if you put if they say well I don't know about these you know denomination I'm about these you put these names in here forget about the name 3 the Bible history he's gotta send it to an angel of a Church of Ephesus write write these things says he that holdeth the Stemmons 7 starting - what's he doing he's going back to the first person saying hey I still got them seven stars in my hand okay they're mine to handle possession so he owns him seven men completely that's why brother Brown said he he thought somewhere in here he was gonna put Polycarp right he thought Polycarp fit the bill or fit the UM criteria but the Holy Spirit said nope there's one thing I've got against him he was lenient toward organized religion of the day one little mark kept them from being the trkage so if one little mark kept him here we go if one little mark kept him then one little mark can't keep these two people it would keep these people out man one little lark one little mark thanks to a cloud what if he wants that one little mark would keep him out and that's what they're saying then he made a mistake oh I made a mistake by giving the message to this man right here and he's a deceiver no we've heard that now that he said whatever they say it is easy to see please be careful be careful when you call them a deceiver but you know what you're doing you're calling god of the saber because right here we're gonna stop the books there this thing I think it's what is it in play all right and to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven star so it's coming straight from God to that messenger to a church not the pattern nail I mean get the pattern holes I'm back to this again if the pattern holds we gotta have a messenger here somebody's got to get that message from God to give us now that last interchange so that's what Paul did Paul's message called them out of the Ephesian Church a member rots in no age Brydon like you coming to Bryson in heavenly places so we've been called out of this but we still read the characteristic we're still in time we're still in the age still got the characteristically age right but God says I've got to have an angel and I gotta have a jerk and there's a message to give to the church seven times you making complete so tell me where this person had well we know we're it's some level five in my soul they God spoke through this right here and brought us a messy unique code there's nothing left there's not another one he couldn't bring a message fall off the scene on another one step up okay it's got to be him bringing the message and then us going on into eternity right until the Church of Ephesus write these things says he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks listen God's words gonna be made Memphis regardless whether you think it is from the brother so-and-so died NASA God's Word is going to be made manifest when he is walking you know we always say well the devil was walking up and down well you know what God is doing God was there first he's gonna protect his group there's no doubt he's gonna protect his group and then we'll talk about this afternoon how he protects agreement God will get into the characteristic ladder let's go [Music]
