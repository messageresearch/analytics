[7:28] that's all Santa this time
[7:30] of responsibly
[7:33] okay
[7:43] good morning everyone
[7:47] no I don't think that's it I don't know
[7:50] whether
[7:52] should be rejoicing and happy this
[7:54] morning or sad
[7:55] there are so many people that's exactly
[7:58] don't know more about Jesus Christ now
[8:00] than they did when he rose two thousand
[8:02] years ago and so you know we Rejoice
[8:06] that we are growing near right the time
[8:08] he's coming back but it's it's sad for
[8:10] the people
[8:15] Luke 24. so let's pray today that God
[8:20] would touch our hearts and reveal
[8:22] yourself to everyone
[8:35] St Louis the 24th chapter reverses one
[8:40] through 26.
[8:45] now upon the first day of the week very
[8:47] early in the morning they came out to
[8:49] deceptica bringing the spices which they
[8:53] had prepared and certain others with
[8:55] them
[8:56] processor
[9:01] and they entered in and found not the
[9:03] body of the Lord Jesus
[9:15] and as they were afraid and bowed down
[9:17] their face to the Earth they said unto
[9:20] them Christ seek ye the living among the
[9:23] dead amen he is not here remember
[9:33] sing the son of man must be delivered
[9:36] unto the hands of sin for men
[9:38] and be crucified the third day rise
[9:42] again
[9:43] and they will remember his word
[9:49] and return from the subsequent and told
[9:51] all these things onto the 11th and to
[9:55] all the rest
[9:57] of
[10:01] James amen
[10:09] and their words seem to them as our
[10:11] tales and they believe them not
[10:15] amenities
[10:29] and behold two of them
[10:32] went the same day to the village and
[10:35] called him is which was from Jerusalem
[10:38] from about three skull furlongs
[10:40] together
[10:45] and it came to pass that while they
[10:48] communed together and reason gives
[10:51] himself through near and went with them
[10:54] but their eyes
[10:59] and he said unto them what men of
[11:01] communication are these that ye have one
[11:05] to another as you walk and are said
[11:22] and he said unto them what things and
[11:26] they said unto him concerning Jesus of
[11:28] Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[11:31] indeed and worry before God and all the
[11:34] people
[11:35] and now the cheap Breeze you know we
[11:38] were delivered again today and then
[11:41] crucified him

[26:32] that's the way he's here so he's Rising
[26:35] yeah
[26:37] he's not dead
[26:40] Easter the prophet said prove
[26:43] what all Jesus said the large statements
[26:46] could be made was it when he raised
[26:49] that saw the problem amen that settled
[26:53] the whole thing proved who he was so
[26:55] then let's just sing that brother he is
[26:56] here
[27:15] I will
[27:18] explain
[27:45] it it was a loud message
[27:52] foreign
[29:03] I know
[29:11] holy holy
[29:15] holy Christ
[29:23] amen well one thing to see him in the
[29:26] prophet is one thing to see him in your
[29:28] pastor in the ministry the the deacons
[29:30] the elders the trustees another thing
[29:33] deceiving yourself that's it you want to
[29:35] see him in his word because we're not
[29:36] going to assume in a physical form and
[29:37] we don't see him in his word as well and
[29:41] so
[29:42] God help us today just to minister the
[29:44] word that will
[29:46] make
[29:48] make it a reality to us right amen he is
[29:51] always today as always he's the central
[29:54] theme of our gathering nice and purpose
[29:57] uh for our
[29:59] uh our living our breathing our
[30:02] existence our very existence is to serve
[30:04] the Lord Jesus Christ holy holy holy you
[30:08] know I love singing brother Madam talked
[30:09] about singing so much I love singing and
[30:12] and just what's accomplished uh by
[30:15] singing I think Saul had an evil spirit
[30:17] one day or it's evil spirits one day and
[30:20] uh you know what delivered with good
[30:21] songs amen he called for David said
[30:23] bring the heart start playing start
[30:24] singing those beautiful glorious songs
[30:27] and all of a sudden the spirits just
[30:28] lifted and uh and that's the purpose of
[30:31] a song service that's the purpose of the
[30:32] song service that's right and you know
[30:34] brother vanson about singing he said uh
[30:36] well he talks he says number one he said
[30:39] you know he said this Bible is a
[30:40] dispensational book God's a
[30:41] dispensational god brother Bantam found
[30:43] out he was a dispensationalist and he
[30:45] said every Revival he said produces its
[30:47] own songwriters because when God unfolds
[30:49] more of his word their songwriters here
[30:51] to pick it up and take that Revelation
[30:54] and put it to music and we sing about
[30:56] those things that have such a a present
[30:58] tense meaning
[31:01] and it reinforces those very things that
[31:04] your pastor speaks from wait expect
[31:06] those things and uh I say this and I'm
[31:09] thinking that it's not gonna be critical
[31:10] by any means but the little song uh that
[31:13] we were singing uh uh every promise in
[31:16] the book is mine right and it just
[31:17] struck me so wait wait not really not
[31:20] really there's a lot of promises brother
[31:21] man said there's in the message
[31:23] unbelieving God he said there's 600
[31:24] something Promises to the bride all
[31:26] right now those are the ones you want to
[31:27] claim but really you don't want to claim
[31:29] every promise in the book because
[31:30] there's a promise of tribulation to a
[31:33] lot of people who respect I want to
[31:34] claim that one there's a promise of Hell
[31:36] to the wicked and I don't recline
[31:38] see there's there's a promise there's
[31:41] many there's Promises to the Jews that
[31:43] ain't gonna apply to us so I can't I
[31:44] can't claim his promise or that promise
[31:46] so is is we are as well
[31:48] dispensationalists we look in the
[31:50] scriptures we see well that applies to
[31:51] me that applies to me that's a promise
[31:53] to the bride that's a promise thing you
[31:54] see what I'm saying those are the ones
[31:55] we want to claim right right so you know
[31:57] it might be better every promise in the
[31:59] book that's mine I will claim through
[32:01] the there was love divine you see be
[32:03] more specific so that's the way we are
[32:05] this message has made us it's made us
[32:07] specific about things and so right A lot
[32:10] of times I know back back home into your
[32:12] pastor brother Wade has been there we
[32:13] have we have a projector here you're the
[32:16] lower ceiling wouldn't allow you to do
[32:17] that but we project our uh songs back
[32:20] there and the brothers have the computer
[32:21] and we can even just change words on the
[32:23] Fly because sometimes we'll be singing a
[32:25] song yeah and it's you know that might
[32:26] be good in the Pentecostal age of the
[32:28] back because all the songs that we have
[32:29] were written in other ages that's
[32:31] recently got Pentecostal songs and back
[32:33] to songs about not to say the meaning of
[32:35] those you know we can't still sing those
[32:38] because I like Amazing Grace they'll
[32:40] always be amazing grace to us but we're
[32:41] going to understand Grace like the world
[32:43] they don't understand
[32:44] and so uh and so uh dog's just doing
[32:48] wonderful things among us and we
[32:50] certainly love him uh today uh now let's
[32:53] just get right to the word this morning
[32:54] I want to read two verses of uh two
[32:57] places let's get to Revelation chapter
[32:58] one
[32:59] verse 17 and 18 and then also be turning
[33:03] to Second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7.
[33:06] and while you're turning I want to say
[33:08] how much I have thoroughly thoroughly
[33:10] enjoyed my visit here first time in
[33:12] Louisville Georgia I trust it won't be
[33:14] my last not necessary to come to preach
[33:15] but just a fellowship with uh with your
[33:18] pastor and I find it just to be just a
[33:20] wonderful brother lovely brother and
[33:22] it's just an honor for me and really I
[33:24] see if my bottom of my heart just an
[33:25] honor for me to be here my brother Jim
[33:27] sister Darlene from our assemblies come
[33:29] come with me and we appreciate them
[33:31] coming and nothing's expensive anymore
[33:33] getting your car traveling there it's
[33:35] it's just expensive to do that but uh
[33:37] we've had such a wonderful wonderful
[33:39] time I met your pastor probably been 15
[33:41] 18 years ago I don't know if you
[33:42] remember it was a Gerald Hughes
[33:43] ministers meeting way way back when and
[33:47] uh we didn't really get a lot of course
[33:48] there's 15 20 minutes to get a lot of
[33:50] time to just disband him and we just
[33:52] kind of long cut lost contact and went
[33:54] our separate ways and so forth so I'm
[33:56] glad the Lord has brought us back
[33:57] together not something I orchestrated I
[33:59] didn't look through a message directory
[34:01] and say what's I'm gonna call him and it
[34:02] doesn't work that way so the Lord knows
[34:04] who to put together he knows who
[34:08] knows whose spirit is going to be
[34:09] commensurate
[34:11] and spirit and so forth right so um so
[34:14] we just want to say how thankful we are
[34:16] for the sisters that have cooked meals
[34:17] and and just tended to us God bless you
[34:20] richly for that I just appreciate it so
[34:22] so so so very very much
[34:24] Revelation chapter 1 verse 17.
[34:27] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[34:31] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[34:33] saying fear not
[34:35] I'm the first to have the last now
[34:37] John's speaking also was the type of the
[34:39] Bride saying fear not I'm the first and
[34:42] the last I am he that liveth and was
[34:45] dead and behold I'm Alive forevermore
[34:47] amen and have the keys of death of hell
[34:51] and of death amen all right now let's go
[34:55] also over to Second Timothy chapter one
[34:56] and verse 7.
[34:58] excuse me the Apostle Paul speaking
[35:03] Apostle Paul speaking second Timothy
[35:04] chapter one and verse 7.
[35:08] now watch his words here for God
[35:12] hath not given us the spirit of fear
[35:15] right right but of power and of love and
[35:19] of a sound mind let me read it again for
[35:21] God has not given us a spirit of fear
[35:22] right exactly the power and of love and
[35:25] of the sound of my couldn't could we
[35:27] just throw our hands in a word of prayer
[35:29] this morning heavenly father it's it's
[35:32] an honor it's a privilege to assemble on
[35:35] this Sunday morning the Lord to honor
[35:36] the resurrection and it is the day that
[35:39] we've set aside Lord to be conscious and
[35:41] uh remembering what you have
[35:44] accomplished this day brother Adam said
[35:47] it was the day that he proved everything
[35:49] that he said we've become the
[35:51] benefactors of that Resurrection he said
[35:53] what a resurrection that was and what a
[35:55] resurrection this is because he lives we
[36:00] can live also thank you for that Lord
[36:02] thank you for that father so Lord as we
[36:04] turn our attention toward the word uh
[36:07] today I would pray as David did let my
[36:09] tongue be is the pen of a ready writer
[36:12] to take the word Lord May the Holy
[36:14] Spirit and describe it on the tables of
[36:15] our hearts that we might be written
[36:17] Epistles unto God known and read of all
[36:21] men may we be a walking letter a walking
[36:23] word a walking representation of the
[36:27] Lord Jesus Christ in whom we love and
[36:29] appreciate and adore thank you Father
[36:32] for our time together May the Holy
[36:33] Spirit weave this word into the fabric
[36:35] of our soul that we might live here
[36:37] leave here a better people better
[36:39] prepared to face the challenges and the
[36:42] adversaries Lord the forces that Satan
[36:44] has placed out there the 200 million
[36:46] demons and so forth you have a strength
[36:48] to overcome in this hour for we'll ask
[36:50] in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus
[36:52] Christ all of God's people said praise
[36:54] the Lord praise the Lord God bless you
[36:56] may be seated amen this morning I want
[36:59] to uh I want to wax more pastoral this
[37:01] morning Sunday morning is generally the
[37:03] time uh to do that so uh I had several
[37:07] ways that we could go but the Lord just
[37:09] seemed to impress this direction on our
[37:11] hearts
[37:12] I ran across I ran across a quote a
[37:15] while back that I'd like to share with
[37:16] you this morning and this pretty much
[37:17] kind of give me the foundation uh to go
[37:20] in this direction brother Benham said in
[37:22] the message is really katus barnia he
[37:24] said the greatest thing I find against
[37:27] the church tonight is fear right right
[37:31] the greatest thing I find this is
[37:33] Brother Adam's observation she's looking
[37:36] out over the Turks and he said the
[37:37] greatest thing I find he said tonight in
[37:40] the church's fear Everybody's scared to
[37:41] death about something he said what are
[37:43] you scared about if a man's born again
[37:45] he should be happy right and free just
[37:48] like these fellas singing up here and
[37:49] the brother testified back there he said
[37:51] just read there ain't nothing can harm
[37:53] you nothing present nothing future
[37:55] nothing can separate us from the love of
[37:58] God that's in Christ God has promised
[38:01] interesting statement isn't it the
[38:04] greatest thing I find against the church
[38:05] tonight is fear right now let me qualify
[38:08] that granted he made this statement 58
[38:10] years ago and it certainly won't be this
[38:14] way when the bride leaves the Earth
[38:16] nevertheless the prophet is identifying
[38:19] what he would perceive to be an obvious
[38:21] problem uh in the church
[38:24] as was the Apostle Paul as he wrote to
[38:27] Timothy and he said God has not given us
[38:30] the spirit of fear so he must have seen
[38:33] it as well among his people all right so
[38:35] where did it come from he said now God
[38:37] didn't give us the spirit of fear but
[38:39] what he did give us is this he gave us
[38:42] the spirit of love
[38:44] and of power and of a sound mind which
[38:48] actually means a uh a sane mind right it
[38:51] means the same mind a mind of a singer
[38:53] in one's in one's senses fear of them
[38:57] according to Paul is contrasted with
[39:01] soundness of mind or sanity of of the
[39:04] Mind one comes from God and the other
[39:07] comes from the devil so if there's fear
[39:10] present then it'll always serve to to
[39:14] buff it or to fight with your true
[39:16] sanity or your true soundness of mine
[39:18] all right and so once again it gets
[39:21] right back to the greatest battle ever
[39:23] fault the Battleground being the mind is
[39:26] that right now in the message the way to
[39:28] have Fellowship in Chicago 1955 brother
[39:31] Ben said there's only two faculties that
[39:34] govern a human one of them is Faith
[39:37] which brings results and the other is
[39:40] fear right which has no value in it all
[39:43] so if we're not being being led and
[39:46] motivated and encouraged by by faith and
[39:49] walked by faith which brings the results
[39:51] the others fear which has no value in it
[39:53] at all right faith is of god fear is of
[39:57] the devil fear makes you worry and fear
[40:01] makes you wonder right now I want to
[40:04] speak uh for a few minutes this morning
[40:06] on the subject of uh a subject of fear
[40:09] obviously you probably figured that out
[40:11] you'll appreciate my uh my uh my grasp
[40:16] on the obvious I'm sure
[40:19] would you believe that fear is mentioned
[40:22] 385 times in your Bible 385 times
[40:26] another
[40:27] 189 times the word afraid is spoken of
[40:32] and you'll uh if you dig a Little Deeper
[40:34] you'll find that the phrase is fear not
[40:36] fear ye not you shall not fear fear no
[40:39] evil be not afraid or nor be afraid
[40:42] another 101 times in the Bible so almost
[40:48] 600 times the Bible draws your attention
[40:52] to some kind of fear right brother
[40:54] random mentioned fear or fright almost 3
[40:58] 000 times now when a prophet and the
[41:01] word of God give a subject that much
[41:03] attention I'm thinking there must be
[41:05] something to it right man something
[41:07] maybe we ought to ought to look at is it
[41:09] any Wonder Jesus said in the end time
[41:11] Luke 21 26 men's Hearts would be failing
[41:14] them for what fear so it's a very
[41:17] present entity this spirit of fear is
[41:20] that right so I just want us to be
[41:23] conscious and we don't do it just a
[41:24] little bit uh of these things that we
[41:27] already know but just to be remembered
[41:28] and reminded of these things now the
[41:31] word that is used for fear is uh is the
[41:34] Greek word Phobos
[41:36] fomos and it means that which strikes
[41:39] Terror yeah and of course Phobos is the
[41:43] word from which we get our English word
[41:45] phobia how many has ever heard of the
[41:47] word phobia I mean that's what a phobia
[41:49] is a phobia refers to a panic that is
[41:53] completely out of proportion to the
[41:56] perceived threat behind it right let me
[41:58] say that again it's a panic that is
[42:00] completely out of proportion to the
[42:03] perceived threat that's behind it right
[42:05] now the dictionary defines phobia as an
[42:09] intense persistent abnormal irrational
[42:13] or illogical fear of a specific thing or
[42:17] situation that compels an individual to
[42:20] avoid the feared stimulus despite the
[42:23] awareness and reassurance that it's not
[42:25] dangerous it's an exaggerated and often
[42:28] disabling fear usually unexplainable
[42:32] inexplicable or baffling or
[42:35] incomprehensible or mysterious to the
[42:37] subject and having sometimes a logical
[42:40] but unusually and illogical or symbolic
[42:44] effect
[42:45] what a phobia is now the Discovery
[42:48] Channel a few years ago they did a story
[42:49] on the top 10 phobias that people have
[42:52] I don't know you always make studies
[42:53] about everything so they looked at and
[42:56] they questioned a lot of people what are
[42:57] your phobias what are you scared of what
[42:58] are you scared of
[42:59] and let me just share a few of them with
[43:01] you
[43:02] number 10 was necrophobia you know what
[43:06] that is that's the fear of death They
[43:08] concluded that it causes some people to
[43:10] worry so much about dying that they just
[43:12] have very little quality of life because
[43:13] they're just so worried about dying
[43:15] number nine was
[43:17] brontophobia now that's not the fear of
[43:19] brontosauruses that's not what it is
[43:21] it's the it's the fear of thunderstorms
[43:24] you ever known anybody who's afraid of
[43:26] thunderstorms well many people are I
[43:29] read a little story a story a little
[43:30] while back it said One Summer Night
[43:32] During a severe thunderstorm a mother
[43:34] was tucking her small son into bed she's
[43:36] about to turn the light off when he
[43:38] asked in a trembling voice mommy would
[43:39] you stay with me all night smiling the
[43:41] mother gave him a warm reassuring hug
[43:43] and said tenderly I can't deer I have to
[43:46] sleep in Daddy's room a long silence
[43:48] followed at last it was broken by a
[43:50] shaky voice saying the big
[43:58] the mind of a child bro Dan told a
[44:01] similar story in a mighty God and Bill
[44:03] remember that he said you must bear and
[44:04] not mine we go to church certainly we
[44:06] read the Bible we pray we are a
[44:08] Christian family we believe in God and
[44:10] we believe that in storms and whatever
[44:12] goes on God is our protection he said
[44:15] Mama I believe every bit of that she's
[44:17] talking to a little boy mom I believe
[44:18] every bit of that but when that life
[44:22] amen amen he said so I think not only
[44:25] junior he said but all of us feel that
[44:27] way right
[44:30] and then number five the Discovery
[44:32] Channel found out through their polling
[44:34] that number five was claustrophobia of
[44:36] course it's the fear of being trapped in
[44:38] a small space or confined space and then
[44:41] number four was agoraphobia and that's
[44:44] the fear of open places
[44:46] and wouldn't have thought that number
[44:48] three was aerophobia which of course is
[44:50] the fear of flying and surprisingly the
[44:53] number one fear among the people that
[44:55] were polled is arachnophobia and of
[44:59] course that's the spirit uh Spider it's
[45:01] the number one fear that people have
[45:04] affecting half of all women and one out
[45:07] of ten men now that's a fair with you
[45:09] can't really I mean you know and that
[45:11] really got you gripped the cancer is not
[45:13] the place you want to be and we not only
[45:14] have the black widows but we have the
[45:16] brown recluse and they can make a mess
[45:18] of you when they go to bite you what not
[45:20] we got them everywhere right got them
[45:22] everywhere so you got to kind of watch
[45:24] the spiders
[45:25] uh
[45:27] psychologists tell us that they're
[45:30] actually they've identified over 530
[45:33] types of phobias or what they call
[45:36] phobic disorders or phobic neuroses that
[45:40] they've discovered in their treatment
[45:41] people over the years now now really
[45:44] what they're talking about is the devil
[45:45] they just give him a name right over 530
[45:48] different fears that people come forward
[45:51] and say I just feel different whatever
[45:53] and so that's what they've done now some
[45:55] of them are let me let me share with you
[45:56] some of the more obscure phobias that
[45:59] you've probably never even heard of and
[46:00] maybe even never knew they existed I'll
[46:03] skimp through some of them there's

[48:36] read that yeah
[48:38] so you're just saying it two or three
[48:40] times getting into fear of long words
[48:42] but perhaps the two most dangerous
[48:44] phobias of all are ecclesiophobia and
[48:48] homophobia you know what things are
[48:50] these are the fear of church and the
[48:53] fear of sermons yeah this might be why
[48:55] you're past you couldn't see some of you
[48:56] every service
[48:58] wake up
[49:00] it might be a homophobiac fear of
[49:03] churches you might be an ecclesiophobia
[49:05] you have a fear of sermons see so now
[49:08] you got a name for your fear yeah if you
[49:10] have either one of these phobias today
[49:12] brother sister you're in trouble you're
[49:14] in trouble
[49:15] how many has ever experienced fear
[49:16] before you ever experienced fear sure
[49:18] we've all experienced fear at one time
[49:20] or another one author writes that fear
[49:22] is the oldest and strongest emotion of
[49:26] mankind yeah somebody said to be human
[49:29] is to experience fear and there's truth
[49:31] to that right and for some that just
[49:33] seems to be no limit to their fears the
[49:36] truth is that every person every
[49:38] Christian has to wrestle they have to
[49:40] battle with their own fears of some sort
[49:43] right some perhaps greater than others
[49:45] Corey ten Boom once said in my times of
[49:48] fear I don't wrestle I Nestle drawings
[49:52] are close to my Lord and Master that I
[49:54] feel his continual shelter and
[49:57] protection did you know the Apostle Paul
[50:00] admitted to having fears within the
[50:02] great Apostle Paul II Corinthians 7 and
[50:05] 5 he said for when we came to Macedonia
[50:07] we had not rest but we were troubled on
[50:10] every side without we're fighting within
[50:14] we're fears right so just like you and
[50:17] me he experienced the fear of inadequacy
[50:20] the fear of failing we're told that
[50:22] Moses struggled with some things right
[50:24] he had some fears we read of Leah it
[50:27] read of Leah in the Bible she had a fear
[50:29] of rejection how about job job had
[50:32] various fears Elijah had fears and the
[50:35] list goes on and on and on but
[50:38] nevertheless do you realize that that
[50:40] that babies human beings are born with
[50:43] only two
[50:45] uh instinctive or two basic fears to
[50:49] inherent fears did you know that only
[50:51] two were born with it one is the fear of
[50:53] loud noises get around a baby oh I think
[50:56] that's that's a natural fear and the
[50:58] other is the fear of unexpected falling
[51:02] those are the only two fears all of the
[51:05] other fears are actually learned fears
[51:09] or fears that are are developed or given
[51:13] to us or put on us at some time in our
[51:17] lives right and we read a few minutes
[51:19] ago that God has not given us the spirit
[51:22] of fear right amen see well where did it
[51:24] come from all right see he's given us
[51:26] the spirit of love and a part and of a
[51:29] sound mind now in the scriptures there's
[51:31] about six variations of the Hebrew word
[51:34] that's translated sound mind it
[51:36] generally means to be in control of your
[51:38] senses it means to be sane right it
[51:40] means to be sober to be tempered it
[51:42] speaks of one who's able to curb his
[51:44] desires or curb his impulses it speaks
[51:47] of a call to moderation and self-control
[51:49] and that's what the scripture speaks of
[51:50] of a sound mind and so this is what God
[51:54] says I will give you this I want you to
[51:56] have this I want you to to to be adorned
[51:58] in this this sanity this sound mind this
[52:01] same mind and I think that's where
[52:03] you'll find I think in Romans 12 welcome
[52:05] to be not conform to the world but
[52:07] transformed by what the renewing of your
[52:09] mind and a word transform is actually
[52:12] translated right and it's the same word
[52:14] you'll find in Matthew 17 where Jesus
[52:16] taketh Peter James and John up to the
[52:18] Mount of transfiguration and was
[52:20] transformed or translated before them
[52:23] right so so here this mind element there
[52:26] must be a transformation of the Mind
[52:27] before there's a translation of these
[52:30] bodies amen think of that so there's a
[52:31] connection here now
[52:33] so God says I'm going to give you
[52:36] A sound mind amen and brother Adam said
[52:39] listen he said the whole world out there
[52:40] is about one degree from Total and Sandy
[52:42] right so what does that mean that means
[52:44] the spirit of fear is so rampant
[52:46] see it's so prominent right that uh that
[52:50] uh that men's hearts and the end time
[52:51] just be feeling better for fear that's
[52:53] right but now that's not the uh that's
[52:55] not a word to the bride there now that's
[52:57] that's it he's not talking about the
[52:58] bride Hearts you know failing and so
[53:00] forth like this
[53:02] so here's here's what I present to you
[53:04] today brother sister and Justin away
[53:06] Justice maybe just a pastoral challenge
[53:08] if you've got fear in your heart fear in
[53:11] your mind in your life I want you to
[53:13] know that God didn't put it there right
[53:15] yeah exactly God didn't give you that
[53:18] and God doesn't intend you to have that
[53:22] or live with that right but he does
[53:25] offer you deliverance from it right
[53:27] right amen all right give you accept it
[53:29] that's right you believe that now keep
[53:31] in mind again the greatest battle ever
[53:32] been fought is still rages in the human
[53:34] mind and fear is a very definite product
[53:37] of the mind so there's two very real
[53:40] forces here this morning striving for
[53:43] control of your mind right amen no
[53:45] wonder Jesus said men's Hearts failing
[53:47] for fear and looking after those things
[53:49] which are coming on the earth we talk
[53:52] about those things last night I would
[53:54] imagine so if an unbeliever was here and
[53:55] we just kind of kind of listed it'd be
[53:57] you know well where can I hide where can
[53:59] I go what can I do there's got to be a
[54:01] provision and there is a provision and
[54:03] that's what we were that's what you call
[54:05] it right I swept the prophet of God
[54:06] there is a provision there is a
[54:09] provision and so uh he said those things
[54:12] are coming upon the Earth for the powers
[54:14] of Heaven shall be shaken right now let
[54:17] me know it's really been an hour right
[54:18] all right remember Paul's teaching on
[54:20] that several years later on the subject
[54:22] he said in Hebrews 12 26 6 whose voice
[54:25] then shook the Earth talking about Moses
[54:27] in the first Exodus his voice shook the
[54:30] Earth and now he's promised saying yet
[54:33] once more I'll shake not only the Earth
[54:36] this will be in the Third Exodus I'll
[54:38] shake not a listen if the voice of Moses
[54:40] shook the Earth I'm telling the prophet
[54:42] of God takes the message around the
[54:44] world seven times and says the world
[54:45] again is falling apart there's a voice
[54:48] in the land that's seeking the Earth
[54:49] amen but he says not only that now he's
[54:52] not going to shake heaven also
[54:54] and this word this expression Paul says
[54:57] yet what's more this expression he said
[55:00] this once more it signifies the removing
[55:04] of those things that are seeking as the
[55:07] things that are made that those things
[55:08] which cannot be shaken May remain I mean
[55:12] those it's a shaking time that's right
[55:13] we're in a shaking time right I remember
[55:16] where is it uh I believe Psalms 50 when
[55:19] David says our God talking about our God
[55:21] is here he said Our God told us him and
[55:24] he said it would still be very
[55:25] tempestuous round about it it'll be very
[55:28] stormy say well I'm in The Loving Arms
[55:30] of Jesus that's true but on the other
[55:32] side it's very tempestuous around about
[55:34] it you remember in Mark chapter 4 the
[55:35] disciples got in the boat with Jesus he
[55:38] had finished preaching the evening had
[55:40] come he said now it's time to pass over
[55:41] to the other side I love that when
[55:43] evening time has come the breaking of
[55:45] the day said it's time to pass over the
[55:47] other side all right Jesus is speaking
[55:49] something to him so they get in the boat
[55:51] with him and then what happened brother
[55:52] bam testimony on the seat said every day
[55:54] with every devil in hell swore that they
[55:56] were gonna gonna drown at those
[55:58] disciples save that boat that night
[56:00] right what what would they have said
[56:02] it's very tempestuous round about him
[56:04] very stormy about it and so that's what
[56:08] we're promised to shaking time right and
[56:10] hear the word shaking means this
[56:13] to cast down from your secure and happy
[56:17] state to overthrow to move to agitate
[56:21] the minds what they're shaking is
[56:22] talking about they're shaking I'll shake
[56:24] everything it means to agitate the mind
[56:26] so they shaken up not a physical shaking
[56:28] out there in buildings moving and so
[56:30] where that'll be here in due time
[56:32] there's an earthquake still on the tell
[56:33] them the docket here still on the
[56:35] calendar right to come but he's talking
[56:36] about the agitation of the mind that
[56:39] needs to disturb so it's only those
[56:41] things that only the only those that
[56:43] cannot be shaken or agitated in the mind
[56:45] see those that are not living under the
[56:48] spirit of fear but have taken the spirit
[56:50] of love and power and of a sound mind
[56:51] see and the only way to withstand is
[56:54] shaking now this greatest battle the
[56:56] only way to come out Victorious is to
[56:58] make sure I've got a sound mind by the
[57:00] word of the Lord now Paul wrote to the
[57:02] Thessalonians he said
[57:04] that he said I would that you be not
[57:07] soon shaken in mind right right or be
[57:11] troubled neither my spirit nor by word
[57:14] nor my letter is from us as the day of
[57:16] Christ is at hand right amen now various
[57:20] versions of the Bible interpret the
[57:22] verse this way uh not to allow your
[57:25] minds to be quickly unsettled or
[57:27] disturbed or kept exiled or alarmed do
[57:31] not let your minds be easily upset do
[57:35] not be troubled by a spirit so we've got
[57:37] sufficient warning here in the scripture
[57:39] don't let a spirit of fear trouble you
[57:42] don't let it shake you don't let it
[57:44] agitate your mind
[57:45] now which bird is he talking about
[57:47] that's going to agitate and disturb your
[57:48] mind well it's the spirit of fear right
[57:50] and that's the spirit that troubles your
[57:52] mind see the spirit of fear so why then
[57:55] are we so troubled by fear right why are
[57:58] we trouble by fear we fear something
[58:00] simply because we don't understand it
[58:01] all right we call that the fear of the
[58:03] unknown ever heard that expression see
[58:05] what's going to happen tomorrow yeah
[58:07] what's going to happen down the road
[58:08] what's going to happen next week what's
[58:10] going to happen to squeeze coming I'm
[58:12] seeing that's the reason we deal you
[58:13] know business we deal with those things
[58:14] and take that fear off of it that's
[58:15] right she's old now I see oh now I
[58:17] understand now I Got Confidence see now
[58:19] I got I got peace in my heart see what
[58:21] I'm saying see so the fear of the
[58:23] unknown what's going to happen what's
[58:24] going to happen next year what's going
[58:25] to happen to my family what's gonna
[58:26] happen to my business what's going to
[58:27] happen in my marriage what's gonna
[58:28] happen to my retirement my future what
[58:30] is it fear of the unknown right then we
[58:33] fear other things because of certain bad
[58:34] experiences that we have right see a dog
[58:37] let me see now I'm afraid of dogs I read
[58:39] of a plane crash and I'm afraid to fly
[58:41] somebody threw me into the pool when I
[58:43] was a child so now I'm afraid of the
[58:44] water my parents divorced when I was
[58:46] when I was a young person so now I'm
[58:48] afraid of marriage and I'm afraid of
[58:49] commitment I was in a car wreck so now
[58:51] I'm afraid to drive you see that and on
[58:53] and on the list could go but I think you
[58:55] get the point
[58:56] these kinds of things brother sister
[58:59] things that just happen in life
[59:02] calamities and misfortunes and and and
[59:05] setbacks and tragedies and overall bad
[59:08] experiences in life will undoubtedly
[59:11] contribute now to certain phobias and
[59:14] complexes that we may we may have here
[59:16] today that if we were to dig deep enough
[59:19] you could actually get to the root of
[59:21] and discover its origin you could do
[59:23] that matter of fact there's a whole
[59:24] scientific field devoted to that very
[59:27] purpose they call them shrinks
[59:29] Psychiatry and psychologists and
[59:32] psychoanalysis and and behavioral
[59:35] psychologists why why is it such a
[59:38] booming feel because so many struggle
[59:40] with fears and follow me
[59:43] and then we're afraid that other times
[59:45] because we just we lack control we feel
[59:48] helpless and even though we've been
[59:49] given scriptural authority over
[59:51] principalities and powers and darkness
[59:53] and over disease and the unknown
[59:55] sometimes we just feel helpless but what
[59:58] I'm saying to you is this that fear is
[1:00:01] very much a part of our Lives perhaps in
[1:00:05] some areas just way too much a part of
[1:00:07] our Lives because look considering the
[1:00:09] economy as it is now
[1:00:12] you might be afraid of losing your job
[1:00:14] or your health or losing your finances
[1:00:17] or losing your retirement losing your
[1:00:19] Investments maybe you're afraid of uh if
[1:00:22] you're afraid of rejection and not being
[1:00:24] accepted by others or maybe you're just
[1:00:26] afraid of growing old or maybe of
[1:00:28] disease or of terrorism or maybe of
[1:00:31] natural catastrophes of plagues and
[1:00:33] sweeping the Earth all of us got have
[1:00:36] got things that caused us to experience
[1:00:39] the emotion that we call fear are you
[1:00:42] with me
[1:00:43] and as a result
[1:00:46] in many cases we try to take precautions
[1:00:48] to protect ourselves don't we right we
[1:00:50] buy insurance policies to cover those
[1:00:52] things we consider valuable like our
[1:00:54] families in our material accumulations
[1:00:56] we put bars on our windows and our doors
[1:00:58] we buy security alarm systems to protect
[1:01:01] our automobiles in our homes all this
[1:01:03] because of what fear right
[1:01:06] researchers at John Hopkins University
[1:01:08] reported that 30 years ago the greatest
[1:01:11] fears
[1:01:12] of great school children were these the
[1:01:16] greatest fear was animals
[1:01:19] the second fear was being in a dark room
[1:01:22] the third fear as they rank in order
[1:01:24] high places
[1:01:25] the fourth fear strangers and the last
[1:01:29] was loud noises
[1:01:31] now you know what the top top five
[1:01:33] things that kids are scared of today
[1:01:35] not one of those 30 years ago fears uh
[1:01:40] month of the kids today the top five
[1:01:42] things kids are scared of number one
[1:01:43] divorce
[1:01:45] number two nuclear war number three
[1:01:48] cancer number four pollution and number
[1:01:51] five being mugged or kidnapped
[1:01:55] it said that the Soviet dictator Joseph
[1:01:57] Stalin so feared for his safety that his
[1:02:01] residence in Moscow contained eight
[1:02:03] bedrooms each night's stolen chose a
[1:02:06] different bedroom at random to ensure
[1:02:08] that no one knew exactly where he was
[1:02:10] sleeping you know why he did this you
[1:02:12] know what motivated to do this fear
[1:02:14] during World War II military Governor
[1:02:16] met with General George Patton and
[1:02:18] Sicily when he praised Patton highly for
[1:02:21] his courage and bravery the general
[1:02:23] replied sir I'm not a brave man the
[1:02:26] truth is I'm an utter Craven coward I've
[1:02:29] never been within the sound of gunshot
[1:02:31] or in the sight of battle in my whole
[1:02:33] life that I wasn't so scared that I had
[1:02:36] sweat in the palms of my hands years
[1:02:38] later when Patton's autobiography was
[1:02:40] published it contained this very
[1:02:43] significant statement by the general I
[1:02:45] learned very early in life never to take
[1:02:48] counsel of my fears yeah right
[1:02:53] let me give you two definitions
[1:02:56] number one
[1:03:00] something is perceived as real a real
[1:03:03] tangible experience for the humans that
[1:03:06] experience them the origin of which you
[1:03:08] do not perceive that you're in control
[1:03:10] of
[1:03:11] fear does not occur I'm sorry fear does
[1:03:14] occur the most uh for the most for most
[1:03:17] humans you simply wait for the precise
[1:03:19] circumstances to appear you wait for the
[1:03:22] mugger you wait for the rejection you
[1:03:24] wait for the disease to establish itself
[1:03:26] in your body
[1:03:27] often motivational speaker Zig Ziglar
[1:03:30] says it like this fear f-e-a-r false
[1:03:33] evidence appearing real
[1:03:35] second and I like this definition the
[1:03:37] best fear is a creation of the human
[1:03:39] mind right
[1:03:42] that's right did you create it right
[1:03:43] here in your mind your career and it
[1:03:46] only exists for the reason you allow it
[1:03:48] to exist so you have control over this
[1:03:50] if you allow fear into existence then
[1:03:53] there is the provability that you are
[1:03:55] capable for you to determine not to
[1:03:58] exist to determine for it not to exist I
[1:04:01] should say
[1:04:02] what I'm saying to you this morning
[1:04:04] brother sister as that whether our fears
[1:04:07] are the result of something unknown or
[1:04:10] the result of sin or the result of
[1:04:13] learned behaviors or the result of bad
[1:04:15] experiences we need to face them right
[1:04:18] at some point in time we've got to
[1:04:20] confront our fears listen to me we've
[1:04:23] got to confront our fears and expose
[1:04:25] them for what they really are because
[1:04:27] when we expose them identify them and
[1:04:30] expose them guess what we can be
[1:04:32] delivered up right but not until then
[1:04:34] all right man
[1:04:35] Charles Allen writes in his book
[1:04:37] entitled victory in the valleys
[1:04:40] he writes five-year-old Johnny was in
[1:04:42] the kitchen as his mother made supper
[1:04:44] she asked him to go into the pantry and
[1:04:46] get her a can of tomato soup but he
[1:04:47] didn't want to go in alone
[1:04:49] it's dark in there and I'm scared she
[1:04:52] asked again and he persisted finally she
[1:04:54] said it's okay son Jesus will be in
[1:04:57] there with you
[1:04:58] Johnny walked hesitantly to the door and
[1:05:01] he slowly opened it he peeked inside and
[1:05:03] he saw it was dark he started to leave
[1:05:06] then all at once an idea came to him and
[1:05:07] he said Jesus if you're in there would
[1:05:09] you hand me that can of tomato soup
[1:05:15] so first we got to identify our fears
[1:05:18] the next thing we've got to do is
[1:05:19] overcome these fears to eliminate them
[1:05:22] deliverance from them listen to me lest
[1:05:25] they seize control and paralyze Us in
[1:05:28] certain areas in our lives you say it
[1:05:30] can't happen well you never convinced
[1:05:32] Joe with that because he said it did
[1:05:33] happen right Joe 3 and 25 he said for
[1:05:36] the thing which I greatly feared is come
[1:05:40] upon me right you read that amen and
[1:05:42] that in that which I was afraid of is
[1:05:45] come unto me I was not in safety neither
[1:05:48] had I rest neither was I quiet yet
[1:05:50] trouble came why did trouble come right
[1:05:53] right he created something in his life
[1:05:56] why did trouble come because of his
[1:05:57] fears right according to job he tells us
[1:06:01] that fear actually became a creative
[1:06:03] Force
[1:06:04] that brought the problem to him right
[1:06:07] the things that he feared why'd you say
[1:06:09] the thing I greatly for did not go about
[1:06:10] this little concern don't worry about
[1:06:12] something but he greatly feared It Came
[1:06:14] Upon him right and that which I was
[1:06:16] afraid of is come unto me
[1:06:20] the new life version says what I was
[1:06:22] afraid of has come unto me what filled
[1:06:25] me with fear has happened
[1:06:28] the Christian Standard Version said for
[1:06:30] the thing I feared has overtaken me and
[1:06:32] what I dreaded has happened to me the
[1:06:35] Contemporary English version said in my
[1:06:36] worst fears have all come true all right
[1:06:39] yep listen to how brother Brown let me
[1:06:42] go to the prophet's message listen to
[1:06:43] how he answers this one question in
[1:06:46] August of 1964. are you listening to
[1:06:48] this morning
[1:06:51] the question was asked him and I this is
[1:06:53] question
[1:06:54] 389 it's on page 11 59 qld book two
[1:06:58] when a person realizes that he has an
[1:07:01] inferior complex or some sort of complex
[1:07:03] how may he overcome this
[1:07:06] somebody's concerned about it asking the
[1:07:07] prophet of God
[1:07:09] now
[1:07:10] the person who's asking this question
[1:07:12] number one recognizes he or she whoever
[1:07:15] was has a complex right they recognize
[1:07:17] it right now what's a complex it's an
[1:07:19] exaggerated or obsessive concern or fear
[1:07:23] so they were they were concerned about
[1:07:25] the spirit now a psychoanalyst would
[1:07:27] tell us that a complex is a combination
[1:07:30] of emotions and impulses that have been
[1:07:32] rejected from awareness but still
[1:07:35] influence a person's Behavior you don't
[1:07:38] know why you do a certain thing right
[1:07:39] and he said if you've rejected the
[1:07:41] awareness of that but something deep
[1:07:43] seated caused you to be fear about this
[1:07:45] fearful about that and you think why why
[1:07:47] am I why am I concerned Why am I fearful
[1:07:49] about that
[1:07:50] you see how subtle a complex can be
[1:07:53] sometimes you're not even aware you have
[1:07:54] it right because it has been rejected
[1:07:57] from awareness but still influences a
[1:08:00] person's Behavior amen all right so this
[1:08:03] person firstly recognizes I've got a
[1:08:07] complex and number two he wants to do
[1:08:09] something about it right huh he wants to
[1:08:12] overcome it he's tired of it he's tired
[1:08:14] of this fear this complex controlling
[1:08:16] his life anymore he wants to overcome
[1:08:18] this thing he doesn't want to live with
[1:08:20] it anymore he's tired of it right now
[1:08:22] watch brother Madam's answer here he
[1:08:24] doesn't just suggest well just learn to
[1:08:26] live with it just accept it just
[1:08:27] tolerate it he doesn't tell him there's
[1:08:29] nothing you can do about it just don't
[1:08:31] forget about it that's not what he tells
[1:08:32] him
[1:08:33] he doesn't tell this believer well go
[1:08:34] find a good treat he'll help you out
[1:08:36] that's not what he says because he knows
[1:08:39] what Paul wrote to Timothy concerning
[1:08:41] the spirit of fear he knows that Satan
[1:08:43] put fear on that person and he knows
[1:08:45] that God wants to deliver him of it and
[1:08:48] this is how he answers the person right
[1:08:50] brother Madam says uh take exactly the
[1:08:53] opposite yeah you're pretty simple he
[1:08:56] said turn right back around and give
[1:08:57] everything you got the other way right
[1:08:59] yeah if you're selfish and you want to
[1:09:01] hold everything then start giving away
[1:09:03] what you got so Brothers identifying
[1:09:05] selfishness as a complex he said you
[1:09:07] want to break through with that break
[1:09:08] free of that thing start giving away
[1:09:09] what you got do whatever just go the
[1:09:12] vice versa you know what that means just
[1:09:14] the other way all right see just flip it
[1:09:16] around that's the way to overcome
[1:09:18] anything is an antidote
[1:09:20] continue to the next verse again he says
[1:09:22] take on the next uh paragraph he says
[1:09:25] take the very vice versa from it now
[1:09:29] we know the promise in this age is to
[1:09:31] the Overcomer right praise God we have
[1:09:34] to overcome we've seen it we testify we
[1:09:36] we overcome all right now let me ask you
[1:09:38] a question if we're not careful we'll
[1:09:41] we'll limit what what we consider to be
[1:09:44] overcoming uh to you know just include
[1:09:48] our own little definition of it oh yeah
[1:09:49] we'll confess well I've overcome the
[1:09:51] Odyssey I'll come out of Babylon I've
[1:09:53] overcome this little besetting sin uh
[1:09:56] I've overcome the Antichrist system and
[1:09:58] I to that I would say amen amen amen
[1:10:00] that's a good start right
[1:10:03] but where do you want to draw the line
[1:10:04] right yeah where do you want to stop is
[1:10:06] that all there is to it is there
[1:10:07] anything else
[1:10:08] see you search your own soul and ask
[1:10:11] yourself this morning see don't you want
[1:10:14] don't you want here's my question to you
[1:10:16] don't you want to overcome everything
[1:10:17] the devil puts on you right amen I don't
[1:10:19] think we have to accept anything the
[1:10:20] devil puts off to you amen or tries to I
[1:10:23] should say it like that see I've
[1:10:25] overcome my sins I'm overcome my temper
[1:10:27] I've overcome my anger my lust my Envy
[1:10:29] my quick tongue my laziness my mouth as
[1:10:32] well my greed and that might be your
[1:10:34] confession and I would say what was that
[1:10:35] all yeah is there more
[1:10:38] I'll ask you again where do you draw the
[1:10:40] line where do you want to stop
[1:10:41] overcoming how about your fingers can we
[1:10:43] include that I think we should all right
[1:10:45] man overcome means to defeat another in
[1:10:48] competition or conflict needs to Prevail
[1:10:51] over to conquer and and Triumph over the
[1:10:53] opposition to be victorious to render
[1:10:55] powerless over the victory it means to
[1:10:57] deal with successfully right deal with
[1:10:59] the issues of Life successfully that's
[1:11:02] it now what now what is it what is it
[1:11:05] then what what what is it to overcome
[1:11:08] see what is overcome so it does it
[1:11:11] include fear yeah can I overcome these
[1:11:13] fears that I have yeah right so what's
[1:11:15] the prophets advice here to this brother
[1:11:17] sister
[1:11:18] disregard your fears refuse to face them
[1:11:21] ignore them right uh let them dictate
[1:11:24] the direction of your life will take
[1:11:25] throw your hands up and discuss and
[1:11:27] they're not exactly he says he says he
[1:11:29] says he says you want to overcome these
[1:11:31] things he said just take the opposite
[1:11:32] right see are you afraid of water today
[1:11:35] you need to go put on your water wings
[1:11:37] and jump in the lake you afraid of
[1:11:40] heights you need to plan your trip to
[1:11:41] Pike's Peak you scared of flying you
[1:11:43] need to get on an airplane you scared of
[1:11:45] spiders you're gonna run up step on one
[1:11:47] right you're a lot bigger than he is
[1:11:49] right what's brother man I'm telling us
[1:11:52] he's telling us that your fears will
[1:11:54] control you right if you don't control
[1:11:57] them overcome them amen and we've all
[1:11:59] got some sort of fear or fears that we
[1:12:01] have to overcome but and here's the
[1:12:03] catch you've got to be willing to
[1:12:05] overcome your fears and that's where a
[1:12:07] whole lot of people
[1:12:09] married to the lamb page 11 Phoenix 1962
[1:12:12] brother said if you'll notice he's
[1:12:14] quoting Revelation 19 11 and 12. he said
[1:12:16] she has made herself ready
[1:12:20] so many says that the Lord will take
[1:12:22] this evil spirit from me from drinking
[1:12:24] or from gambling or from life or from
[1:12:26] stealing then I'll serve him he said but
[1:12:28] that's up to you yeah you got something
[1:12:30] you got something too exactly see and we
[1:12:32] I mean we've just I don't know maybe
[1:12:33] just been taught Through The Years God
[1:12:34] delivered me this God deliver me that
[1:12:36] God brother and trust me I says no
[1:12:37] that's something you've got to do that's
[1:12:39] part of that process making yourself
[1:12:41] ready that's right he said something you
[1:12:42] got to do right they that overcome shall
[1:12:45] inherit all things see he says he said
[1:12:48] you can't he said God can't push you
[1:12:50] down a four inch pipe pull you out the
[1:12:52] other hand but set you up on your feet
[1:12:53] and say bless it he's overcome said he
[1:12:55] had nothing overcome right amen so you
[1:12:58] got to do they that are going to inherit
[1:12:59] all things they that overcome equation
[1:13:01] now watch this you've got power to do it
[1:13:03] but you must be willing to lay it down
[1:13:07] there it is right I'd be willing to be
[1:13:09] delivered got to be willing to control
[1:13:10] it got to be willing to to confront this
[1:13:13] thing right
[1:13:15] how about laying down your fears she's
[1:13:17] made herself ready he goes I like that
[1:13:19] word
[1:13:20] Dr Martin Lloyd Jones recognized by many
[1:13:23] have been one of the finest British
[1:13:24] preachers of the 20th century he was a
[1:13:27] minister of Westminster Chapel in London
[1:13:30] from 1938 to 1968.
[1:13:33] and he made this statement he said when
[1:13:35] a man is defeated by life
[1:13:38] it's always due ultimately to the fact
[1:13:41] that he's suffering from a spirit of
[1:13:43] fear
[1:13:44] the spirit of fear is the real the
[1:13:47] ultimate cause of all failure in life
[1:13:49] and of all unhappiness that's right
[1:13:52] spirit of fear the culprit the culprit
[1:13:55] that's right of all figuring life and
[1:13:57] happiness quite a statement
[1:13:59] in the message show us the father it'll
[1:14:02] satisfy brother Madam said you must be
[1:14:03] willing to whatever it is lay it aside
[1:14:07] every weight that nothing easily beset
[1:14:09] you and run the race with patience now
[1:14:11] he's quoting the Apostle Paul in Hebrews
[1:14:13] 12 and 1. where Paul is dealing with the
[1:14:16] believer's besetting sins and he only
[1:14:19] mentions them one time in all of his
[1:14:21] letters Paul does and beset beset when
[1:14:24] Paul calls him besetting sins it means
[1:14:25] to attack from all sides sins that
[1:14:29] trouble persistently to harass to him
[1:14:31] and her surround now
[1:14:33] Paula said these are the things that we
[1:14:35] want to address identify address and be
[1:14:38] willing to overcome all right now let me
[1:14:40] ask you let me ask you a a a question
[1:14:43] did Brother about a preach a sermon
[1:14:44] entitled a total Deliverance
[1:14:46] anybody ever read it what do you think
[1:14:49] you might be talking about right in
[1:14:51] total
[1:14:53] Deliverance right what was his message
[1:14:55] in that sermon
[1:14:57] he said God wants to bring you to a
[1:14:59] total deliverance from everything that's
[1:15:01] got you Shackled everything that's got
[1:15:03] you bound and fettered God wants to
[1:15:05] bring it delivers right you know what
[1:15:07] Deliverance is is literally the rescue
[1:15:10] from Bond ordained or danger yeah I
[1:15:13] suspect some of us here today perhaps
[1:15:14] need to be be delivered from the bondage
[1:15:18] of of a fear in some way because fear is
[1:15:21] not a believer's natural response to
[1:15:23] that thing the confront you it's a
[1:15:25] spirit that Satan has put on you and the
[1:15:27] prophet of God tells us that God wants
[1:15:29] you and I to be delivered can you say
[1:15:31] Amen
[1:15:33] convinced then concerned Chicago 62. he
[1:15:36] said we must be willing and open to
[1:15:38] receive God and whatever God's got for
[1:15:41] us with an open heart we must receive it
[1:15:44] all right whatever is God's got we must
[1:15:46] receive it all right now if God's

[1:18:58] for the blemish owner for we want a
[1:19:00] complete and total deliverance from
[1:19:01] everything Lord that would keep us from
[1:19:03] being the light of the world a candle
[1:19:06] that set on a hill not a bushel over it
[1:19:07] but a candle's out on a hill that gives
[1:19:09] light to God people's feet in the way
[1:19:11] that's right granted father
[1:19:14] great Glory yes listen to David's prayer
[1:19:17] in the 34th song The psalmist David the
[1:19:19] man who was after God's Own Heart amen
[1:19:21] David said I sought the Lord and he
[1:19:24] heard me and delivered me from all my
[1:19:26] fears David what'd you beseech the Lord
[1:19:29] for talk about secret Lord signature it
[1:19:31] was for a specific command all right
[1:19:32] thank you I got some fears here I'm not
[1:19:34] going to leave with I'm not going to be
[1:19:35] holding shackle about by all these fears
[1:19:37] can't do this keep doing that because
[1:19:38] I've created something in my mind I'm
[1:19:40] praying this phrase this idea see what
[1:19:41] I'm saying so David said man after God's
[1:19:43] Own Heart I assault the Lord he heard me
[1:19:46] and delivered me from all my fears and
[1:19:49] God is not a respective person so if God
[1:19:51] can do that for David in the Old
[1:19:52] Testament he can do it for you today
[1:19:54] that's right and do it for me today if
[1:19:56] if if if you're wanting to be delivered
[1:19:58] if you're willing to be delivered right
[1:20:00] you got to ask yourself am I willing to
[1:20:03] that's right you take your control the
[1:20:05] truth is he can deliver you from fear
[1:20:08] from the bondage of your brother sister
[1:20:09] only if you're willing to be delivered
[1:20:11] if you're happy with your fears and
[1:20:13] accepting of your fears and willing to
[1:20:14] let and willing to let them control your
[1:20:16] life well I would feel sorry for you but
[1:20:19] that's your decision that's your choice
[1:20:21] amen David said I sought the Lord for
[1:20:24] what Deliverance of his fears amen David
[1:20:26] said I've got fears I've got phobias
[1:20:28] I've identified my life and they're
[1:20:30] controlling me they're holding me in
[1:20:32] bondage and check he absolutely knew the
[1:20:34] same thing Paul knew that God has not
[1:20:37] given me these fears and he reveals to
[1:20:39] us those writings and he wants to
[1:20:41] confront these fears and he wants to
[1:20:42] receive calling the lyrics from these
[1:20:44] spirits and God said I'll do it and he
[1:20:46] did it amen amen thank you Lord man
[1:20:49] sooner or later brother sister we don't
[1:20:51] have to deal with this picture here
[1:20:52] right yeah right you may know where I
[1:20:54] was going here first John 4 17 18.
[1:20:58] and we're going to have to do something
[1:20:59] with it we're going to have to look at
[1:21:00] this and do something with it
[1:21:02] watch what happens in the hour when
[1:21:04] perfect love comes on the scene
[1:21:11] first John 4 17 here it is our love made
[1:21:14] perfect God perfected his love now right
[1:21:17] that we may have boldness now amen which
[1:21:20] is courage it's Assurance in the day of
[1:21:22] judgment because as he not was or will
[1:21:25] be but as he is right so are we in this
[1:21:27] world so it's identify what he uses as
[1:21:31] he is so are we same word speak to the
[1:21:33] green speech of the Bride amen right
[1:21:34] amen identify myself a part of it
[1:21:37] the word for boldness there is parhesia
[1:21:39] and it means fear I'm sorry free and
[1:21:43] fearless confidence cheerful courage
[1:21:46] assurance
[1:21:48] first John 4 18.
[1:21:51] John likes this there is no fear in love
[1:21:55] right but perfect love
[1:21:58] all right wow all right amen what's the
[1:22:01] effect what's what's perfect love gonna
[1:22:03] do well it's gonna cast out your
[1:22:04] feedback if you're willing if you'll let
[1:22:07] it right
[1:22:08] amen perfect love Dustin Stay With Me
[1:22:11] cast out fear amen all right now I've
[1:22:14] got a question for you if fear wasn't
[1:22:17] going to be an issue for the ride of
[1:22:18] this end time why then does the Holy
[1:22:21] Spirit bring this to our attention at
[1:22:23] this time and Associate it with this
[1:22:26] perfect love that is to be present and
[1:22:28] manifested in this hour in the lives of
[1:22:31] his people right amen I'll tell you what
[1:22:33] because John who is a type of a bride
[1:22:36] knew that this would be the day and the
[1:22:39] hour that the spirit of fear would have
[1:22:41] to be personally identified and
[1:22:44] confronted and dealt with and delivered
[1:22:46] from right
[1:22:49] so two things we're told the perfect
[1:22:50] love will do number one it will create
[1:22:53] in us a Fearless
[1:22:56] hi
[1:22:57] mother said if you got they said if you
[1:22:59] know your position you know you're
[1:23:01] standing the word he said you can be
[1:23:02] Fearless he said you can tell anybody
[1:23:04] everybody it don't matter what anybody
[1:23:06] says anybody does you can stand alone
[1:23:08] not even just like the lives of the rest
[1:23:09] of them just stand alone it doesn't
[1:23:10] matter because you've got a revelation
[1:23:12] this word right yes that's right didn't
[1:23:15] Jesus say in John didn't Jesus say that
[1:23:19] in John 8 32 he said you'll know the
[1:23:21] truth and the truth will make you free a
[1:23:23] lot of times we call it set you free but
[1:23:24] it's different except free and make free
[1:23:25] right he'll make you free make you free
[1:23:28] John's telling us that fear and perfect
[1:23:30] love cannot coexist and once the closer
[1:23:33] you get the Capstone the further you're
[1:23:35] going to get from theater right the more
[1:23:36] delivered you you uh you are from fear
[1:23:39] that you actually become right amen so
[1:23:43] in the word now this cleansing purging
[1:23:47] perfecting uh element of the word is
[1:23:50] going to make you free now the word here
[1:23:53] make means deliver or said it Liberty
[1:23:56] come on the world will deliver you the
[1:23:59] word will set you in Liberty in other
[1:24:01] words this word this Revelation this
[1:24:04] message will deliver you and liberate
[1:24:06] you from all these fears that Satan has
[1:24:09] uh just loaned you for a while
[1:24:20] right so Jesus is saying as you get to
[1:24:24] know me as you learn to think the way I
[1:24:27] want you to think as you begin to live a
[1:24:30] life worthy of the Gospel the way that I
[1:24:33] want you to live as you learn the truth
[1:24:35] then you will be not just set free but
[1:24:38] made free from fear from sin from the
[1:24:41] uncertainties of Life why because
[1:24:43] perfect love casts out fear
[1:24:47] when Jesus was asked about the greatest
[1:24:49] commandment he answered without
[1:24:50] hesitation he said love the Lord your
[1:24:53] God with all your heart with all your
[1:24:55] soul with all your mind with all of your
[1:24:56] strength is that what he said now what
[1:24:59] happens if I truly love God with all my
[1:25:01] body and my mind and my emotions that
[1:25:04] means I'll no longer be afraid of what
[1:25:06] could affect me physically exactly Jesus
[1:25:08] said fear not what men can do it right
[1:25:10] but you better fear Him who can actually
[1:25:12] take the body and soul and throw you in
[1:25:14] the Lake of Fire amen so I'm no longer
[1:25:18] them to be afraid of what can afflict me
[1:25:20] physically I no longer need to be afraid
[1:25:22] of mental anxieties I no longer need to
[1:25:25] be afraid of emotional insecurities and
[1:25:27] uncertainties why because perfect love
[1:25:29] right perfect love Christ The Headstone
[1:25:31] is here and perfect love cast out fear
[1:25:34] all right amen
[1:25:36] listen if your security depends on your
[1:25:38] bank account it depends on your Visa and
[1:25:40] Mastercards it depends on your good
[1:25:42] health on your own good relationships
[1:25:44] with family friends and church members
[1:25:45] we're doomed to failure right right I'll
[1:25:48] tell you right now the only secure
[1:25:49] relationship we can have is in Christ
[1:25:52] Jesus the word right amen all right
[1:25:54] because he is the element He is The
[1:25:58] Source by which perfect love casts up
[1:26:00] here right that's right the message
[1:26:02] translation says this there is no room
[1:26:04] in love for fear
[1:26:06] well-formed love banishes fear a New
[1:26:10] Living Translation says it expels Fear
[1:26:14] The Net Bible says it drives out fear
[1:26:18] since fear is crippling a fearful life
[1:26:22] fear of death fear of judgment is one
[1:26:25] not yet fully formed in love
[1:26:29] wow that's something right we're talking
[1:26:31] about getting interaction conditions
[1:26:32] what we're talking about exactly does
[1:26:35] that sound like a Rapture Runner
[1:26:36] believer filled with fears and phobias
[1:26:38] and doubts and worries and insecurities
[1:26:40] and affordables and things like that I
[1:26:41] don't think so that's right but first we
[1:26:44] need to expose our fears then we need to
[1:26:46] eliminate overcome our fears because
[1:26:48] Verse 18 watch Fear half torment amen
[1:26:51] you know what that is you know what
[1:26:53] torment is is Middle anguish
[1:26:55] Middle English and sometimes it even
[1:26:58] refers to it refers to great great
[1:27:00] physical pain
[1:27:01] see not testifying of his gifts Hammond
[1:27:04] Indiana 1952 Alabama said so don't fear
[1:27:06] fear is of the devil
[1:27:08] Everything Jesus would say fear not fear
[1:27:10] not fear not constantly fear not fear
[1:27:11] not if you're not they're right always
[1:27:12] fear not and God don't want you to fear
[1:27:15] all right
[1:27:16] he wants you to believe right so every
[1:27:18] one of you believe in one Accord one
[1:27:20] Accord every one of you amen God made a
[1:27:23] way for us in Jeffersonville 52 he said
[1:27:25] and through the services this week
[1:27:27] trying to show people that there's no
[1:27:29] need of being scared the worst thing the
[1:27:32] devil can put on you is fear if you're
[1:27:34] willing to live with the worst thing the
[1:27:36] devil can put on you I don't know I'm
[1:27:38] just talking about risk hold my if I was
[1:27:41] at home I'd say something like I'm
[1:27:42] ashamed of it but I'm not home so I can
[1:27:44] say that yeah go ahead I think better
[1:27:46] though you know what I'm saying
[1:27:49] all right brother
[1:27:51] yeah
[1:27:54] right the worst thing the devil can't
[1:27:58] put on you is I hear all right he said
[1:28:00] even if you had cancer didn't fear and
[1:28:02] believe God would heal you you wouldn't
[1:28:05] be in too bad of shape right God take
[1:28:07] care of that if you were sick whatever
[1:28:08] it is and if you didn't fear so fear is
[1:28:11] one of the worst things that Satan can
[1:28:13] place Upon Us
[1:28:15] I've had a little publication here
[1:28:17] excuse me an old publication
[1:28:20] call today in the word you may have
[1:28:22] heard of it I was all started today
[1:28:24] published back in August of 1992.
[1:28:27] and it was about it was about a fella
[1:28:29] called black Bart ever heard of black
[1:28:31] Bart he was a professional Thief whose
[1:28:34] very name struck fear as he terrorized
[1:28:37] the Wells Fargo Stage Line from San
[1:28:40] Francisco to New to New York his name
[1:28:42] became synonymous with the danger of the
[1:28:45] frontier between 1875 and 1883 which is
[1:28:48] about eight years he robbed 29 different
[1:28:51] Stagecoach Crews amazingly Bart did all
[1:28:55] of this without firing the shot
[1:28:58] because a hood hit his face no victim
[1:29:02] ever saw his face he never took a
[1:29:04] hostage and was never trailed by a
[1:29:07] sheriff instead black bark used fear to
[1:29:10] paralyze his victims
[1:29:12] his Sinister presence was enough to
[1:29:15] overwhelm the toughest Stagecoach guard
[1:29:18] yeah think of that
[1:29:21] boy old Blackboard just use fear to
[1:29:23] paralyze his victims
[1:29:25] yeah I wonder where his inspiration came
[1:29:26] from
[1:29:27] using fear to paralyze his victims no
[1:29:31] wonder brother baham said fear is one of
[1:29:32] the worst things that's taking place
[1:29:33] upon his trash right place upon a person
[1:29:36] man right there was a lady who died in
[1:29:38] 1916 whose name was Eddie green she was
[1:29:41] called America's greatest Miser when she
[1:29:44] died in 1916 she left an S an estate
[1:29:47] valued at a hundred million dollars 1916
[1:29:51] now
[1:29:52] that's probably half a billion dollars
[1:29:54] now or more valued a hundred million but
[1:29:57] she was so miserly that she ate cold
[1:30:01] oatmeal in order to save the expense of
[1:30:03] heating the water oh my god
[1:30:05] when her son had a severe leg injury she
[1:30:09] took so long trying to find a free
[1:30:11] clinic to treat him that his leg had to
[1:30:14] be amputated because of Advanced
[1:30:16] infection no money you got a hundred
[1:30:19] million dollars and you're so miserly
[1:30:22] you won't even turn the stove on to heat
[1:30:25] up would you say there was a spirit of
[1:30:27] fear had something to do with that would
[1:30:28] you say she was shackle she was
[1:30:30] paralyzed absolutely what was her fear
[1:30:34] what was the phobia she was worried
[1:30:36] about losing her wealth so she didn't
[1:30:38] even enjoy her life at all right I don't
[1:30:40] think any of us you'd probably have
[1:30:41] anything to worry about but just in case
[1:30:43] you're a stockpiling millions of dollars
[1:30:45] and depriving yourself and others I'm
[1:30:48] not saying throw caution to the wind and
[1:30:50] uh you know forget about retirement
[1:30:52] planning and such program said you know
[1:30:54] just go ahead you don't just keep
[1:30:55] telling the roofing things like that
[1:30:57] keep on doing it right but if you're

[1:33:27] he said he's lying to the devil's lying

[1:33:49] to God and say praise God that's right
[1:33:50] and I go home and be well now you're
[1:33:52] remembering brother biscoll's testimony
[1:33:54] tape that he was with brother Adam a few
[1:33:56] days later and they ran into that young
[1:33:59] boy the little diner and they talked
[1:34:01] with him and the boy had received his
[1:34:04] Deliverance he didn't go commit his uh
[1:34:06] um uh
[1:34:08] suicide thank you yeah he was uh and he
[1:34:11] was delivered so here's the danger and
[1:34:13] I'm closing now the musicians uh may
[1:34:15] come I understand number one I want you
[1:34:17] to understand this if you take notes
[1:34:19] write this down fear is a curse there's
[1:34:21] a curse
[1:34:22] listen to me brother sister if you're
[1:34:24] living in fear today you're living in an
[1:34:27] emotional prison right you're living
[1:34:29] Behind Bars more powerful than steel
[1:34:32] fear I want you to know is a destructive
[1:34:34] force it destroys abilities and dreams
[1:34:38] it'll destroy potentials and gifts and
[1:34:41] talents that you might have fear has
[1:34:43] destroyed homes and marriages and family
[1:34:45] relationships is destroyed health and in
[1:34:48] fact fear will kill you
[1:34:51] may prove they will right doctors
[1:34:54] Maryland Cleveland of Cleveland and
[1:34:57] Charles S Hirsch of Cincinnati concluded
[1:35:01] that acute stress can provoke changes in
[1:35:05] the heart that may lead to death
[1:35:08] the two doctors recently identified 15
[1:35:11] cases in which people died after a
[1:35:14] physical assault although the injuries
[1:35:16] alone would not have been enough to kill
[1:35:18] him
[1:35:19] 11 of the 15 cases showed a type of
[1:35:22] heart cell death called myofibrillar
[1:35:25] degeneration similar to a reaction in
[1:35:29] experimental animals who are helpless to
[1:35:31] anticipate or avoid Danger
[1:35:34] I'd rather have a fella not long ago who
[1:35:36] got locked in a refrigerator truck you
[1:35:39] know what those are those 18 wheelers
[1:35:40] the refrigerated trucks and the next
[1:35:42] morning they opened the door they found
[1:35:44] the boy dead he froze into death but
[1:35:47] they found there was a little problem
[1:35:48] there the refrigerator unit was not even
[1:35:50] on the temperature was not over 50
[1:35:53] degrees but you know what happened this
[1:35:55] boy was so convinced that he was going
[1:35:57] to freeze to death his fear now just
[1:36:00] like job it it come upon him and it
[1:36:03] brought about his death in other words
[1:36:05] his fear controlled his mind and his
[1:36:07] body completely shut down the boy died
[1:36:09] said because he created this thing in
[1:36:11] his mind that was not even real right
[1:36:12] right that's a shame in it right all
[1:36:15] right another man said this kind of
[1:36:17] fears of the devil right so the devil
[1:36:19] controls fear and because the devil is a
[1:36:22] liar he'll never present fear to you as
[1:36:23] fear right because fear always
[1:36:25] masquerades as something else right sure
[1:36:27] right you know well that's just not my I
[1:36:29] just don't like you said see you know
[1:36:31] it's timidness sometimes uh he'll expose
[1:36:33] itself as a lack of confidence perhaps
[1:36:35] even procrastination quirky Behavior
[1:36:37] Ultra cautious Behavior insecurity in
[1:36:39] many different ways all right there's a
[1:36:41] number of ways that fear impersonates
[1:36:43] what we would call acceptable behavior
[1:36:45] and only because we refuse to
[1:36:47] acknowledge that there is a fear or
[1:36:49] fears in my life you know what we do we
[1:36:51] just simply learned to live with it yeah
[1:36:54] yeah I was going to live with it to form
[1:36:55] my life around this thing and instead of
[1:36:58] confronting them and dealing with them
[1:37:00] scripturally by letting this perfect
[1:37:03] love headstone that's available to us
[1:37:05] drive it out and expel every fear that
[1:37:08] torments us at different times in our
[1:37:11] lives
[1:37:12] see that's what that's the challenge
[1:37:13] that's the four of us today right
[1:37:16] I understand brother sister it was both
[1:37:18] the mission
[1:37:19] and the message of Jesus Christ to
[1:37:21] deliver Mankind from the slavery of fear
[1:37:24] that's why the two words Jesus used most
[1:37:26] in his Earthly Ministry were these fear
[1:37:29] not right right fear not life because
[1:37:31] I'm the way the truth and the life fear
[1:37:33] not death we did it earlier that living
[1:37:35] was dead in the ball of my life
[1:37:36] forevermore and have the keys of death
[1:37:38] and hell right fear not the unknown he
[1:37:40] said I'm Alpha I'm Omega the beginning
[1:37:42] the ending saith the Lord that which was
[1:37:43] which is which is to come the almighty
[1:37:45] right
[1:37:46] 63 times in the Bible we're told to fear
[1:37:50] not amen fear not
[1:37:52] Martin Luther made an interesting
[1:37:53] observation in his little magazine
[1:37:55] called table talk
[1:37:57] he said God and the devil take opposite
[1:38:00] tactics in regard to fear the lord first
[1:38:03] allows us to become afraid that he might
[1:38:06] relieve our fears
[1:38:08] and comfort us the devil on the other
[1:38:10] hand first makes us feel secure in our
[1:38:12] pride in our sins that we might later be
[1:38:15] overwhelmed with fear and despair then
[1:38:19] we could go on and on and on and on
[1:38:20] talking about the phobias and things
[1:38:22] like that but understand listen fear is
[1:38:25] absolutely harmful fear will paralyze us
[1:38:27] it'll keep us from doing things that we
[1:38:29] should do or even want to do how many
[1:38:30] times you want to do something but fear
[1:38:32] kept you from it right well I'd like to
[1:38:33] go out on a boat with everybody but you
[1:38:35] know I understand there will be water
[1:38:37] there won't they
[1:38:39] you'd love to go but I can't because
[1:38:41] I've got a fear that I haven't been
[1:38:43] delivered of that I need to be delivered
[1:38:45] up that I can be delivered because God
[1:38:47] wants me to be amen that's right
[1:38:50] perhaps the preaching of this message
[1:38:51] today brother sister has reminded you of
[1:38:54] some fear that might torment you in your
[1:38:56] life of fear that you need to overcome
[1:38:57] and Conquer your day right see and
[1:39:00] understand I'm closing with this come
[1:39:01] fear it's not a matter of
[1:39:03] self-determination well I'm just going
[1:39:04] to turn to be a better person I mean it
[1:39:05] it's a matter of total dependence on The
[1:39:07] God Who has called us in redeemed Us by
[1:39:09] his Amazing Grace right it's a matter of
[1:39:11] belief in the words of Jesus Christ and
[1:39:14] his promises to you
[1:39:15] it's a matter of recognizing the devil's
[1:39:18] pitiful attempts to you and
[1:39:21] paralyze you with fear and God's
[1:39:23] Majestic Grace in giving you power and
[1:39:25] love and a sound mind amen Paul said
[1:39:28] Philippians 4 30 I can do all things
[1:39:30] through him who gives me strength right

[1:39:47] this tournament but these weeks should
[1:39:48] be adorned in the same sound Righteous

[1:40:10] sacrifice I'm going to confront my fears
[1:40:12] o God and allow this perfect love
[1:40:14] through the means of the perfect work to
[1:40:17] invade these fearful darkened areas of
[1:40:19] my life that I've lived with for so many

[1:41:14] the blood of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:41:15] Amen brother I don't know what key it's

[1:42:38] Lester singing Glory
[1:42:59] amen
[1:43:50] yes I know
[1:44:10] the year has told me
[1:44:13] severeign
[1:44:38] yeah
[1:44:38] you see all you gotta do is lay it on
[1:44:41] the Altar
[1:44:42] and bravely I always had a fear when
[1:44:46] he'll be traveling
[1:44:48] because I hadn't been that way before
[1:44:49] and I prayed and Lord took that away
[1:44:52] because we have a little dispatcher
[1:44:54] problem
[1:44:55] and one day I was going down the road
[1:44:56] and they said
[1:44:58] you know I said look along the way here
[1:45:00] and said these houses everywhere down
[1:45:01] this road and said this Road's going
[1:45:03] somewhere so that means somebody put it
[1:45:05] there yeah
[1:45:08] you know I've never had that fear
[1:45:10] anymore
[1:45:11] he delivered me from that fear just by
[1:45:14] telling me to look along the road
[1:45:17] because I had the fear but now you're
[1:45:20] thinking about driving on the highway
[1:45:21] somebody flipped her yeah
[1:45:23] so it had to go somewhere yeah
[1:45:26] but see you say well I don't have fear
[1:45:29] that Wellness you know everybody's got
[1:45:32] some kind of fear but all you got to do
[1:45:34] is put it under the blood right that's
[1:45:35] it man that's it that's right give it to
[1:45:37] the Lord let him take away that fear
[1:45:40] and then you find out that 99 of the
[1:45:43] things never come to pass right that
[1:45:44] you're afraid of right
[1:45:46] and it's been all day
[1:45:49] in your mind contemplating you know
[1:45:52] and you find it never takes place
[1:45:55] and that's just a figure that's a phobia
[1:45:58] in your dimensions
