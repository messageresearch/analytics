TRANSCRIPT
========================================
take her again after she had already been polluted so not good all right now let's go to Daniel yell it let them use we're going to read some of it but let's go to Daniel 9 & Louise slow me down if I forget your back there ok Daniel 9 24 now what we're going to do is today is we're going to go back and read daniel 9 verse 1 and see how this is how this is unfolding and the reason I'm so adamant about this listen to me we have been over this and over this and over this and over this for the past 20 years and people killed own understanding we got to come to a place to where we understand this and this is more important this should be one of the most important subject brother branham says in the gables instructions and daniel he said right here i turned right to it he said this paragraph 1 13 this is the one most important scripture in the Bible I've got one 13 one most important scripture in the Bible why do we not read it why do we not try to understand it maybe we're like Israel we went whoring after other gods that's all of us it's not just one person's all of it me how much time do we spend studying brief everything else is the Bible and whatever some seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city no look here's what we got want you to make notes take you some notes and write this down seventy weeks are a tournament upon by people who is that the tube Daniel was a Jew so this is to Daniel's people and upon the holy city so there's two things because there are two things to until that's very very important number one their lineage that they're Jews number to that temple that city Jerusalem is the most holy place to them why do you think they're over there why do you think they're trying to dig under that mosque of Omar because that's the abomination that Jesus talked about in Matthew 24 sitting right where the temples erected I mean I said abomination is in the Bible okay so this is this and you say well what is it got to do with me well watch our hair we don't have a city Abraham never had a continuing City but we do have a city that's coming down out of heaven that we won't dwell in and unless we're going again you're not going well in that city so you're not warning in you don't have a city to go to if you're born again you have a city just like the Jews to go to we have a city which is New Jerusalem the Bible said right they come down out of heaven so we do have a spiritual Jerusalem but we are Gentiles are not included in this 70 weeks then I understand them because what look at your chart Thank You chart out from in this is the chart that brother Brown drew the week he preached the seventy weeks of Daniel now this is verified by brother George Smith that Rebecca is the one to drew this she drew it on the blackboard at the church and then she took him and drew it again and had it mimicked Raph those you look at that typing we don't talk like that anymore that's old type so this is an original copy not an original its original copy of what brother Brown drew in the series of things 70 weeks all right there's an updated one that Trudy's got that somebody did that's okay but this is the original dish was what was drawn by a brother branham in 1962 I guess when he preached this right so this is this is an original copy they come from the George Smith verified it daddy called him and he said yes that is Rebecca did every bit of them even if you'll read in your book brother Brown says room but sits and Becky that looks like a girl remember that's the Daniel that's the stone that's the guy that had to have a goal in the chest of brass and all that feet of iron all that stuff he said it looks like a girl he said but it's a better drawing than I can make if you reading you both this way said but look right here this is a gap see that gap that's where the Gentiles come in after the Jews rejected Christ at Calvary this is the Gentile age but this is the seventy weeks of Daniel that's what it's for the people and the city all right we're just remember we're grafted in right we're the one we're the wild one that was grafted in the olive trees always Israel we were grafted in because we're we accepted him as the bride he was just saying right here in Daniel I mean in jail I'm if you're gonna read chapter 3 next week we'll reach out to three he had to put her away because she went out and defiled herself with another man what another nation not a man a nation gonna say one thing alright so what he did he's they said let his blood be on us and our children when they crucified Him and then there's a gap in here will that gap it's what we get that gap is what we get not for the Jews because you got you weak over here you weak 62 in one more week left so we get into the animating a little while but seventy weeks are determined upon thy people who'd you and upon the holy city to do six things now inside this seventy weeks I want to do this come on emphasize this every time cuz it'll help us it will help us to realize that brother branham cannot break scripture he cannot Creek anything but what's in the Bible a man he's a word prophet he cannot preach anything outside the Bible hey man alright so seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city should do six things six things are going to happen inside of those seventy weeks now remember as we said before last Sunday are two Sundays ago that the 70 weeks naturally has already happened nobody there I got that the 70 weeks has actually already happened because Daniel was in captivity he was in the 68 year of the captivity there was two more years before before Ezra and Nehemiah elmwood rebuild the temple will get into all that history layer rebuild the temple and Jews would go out of bondage that was 70 years natural natural but brother Ron said God thought so much of Daniel he included everything all the way to little millennium because truly the Jews are not going to come out of captivity until the Millennium right right truly the nation of Israel 144,000 is not going to come out of captivity until the Millennium now will prove that a little bit later all right because they're still like that still blinded they're still in captivity that hundred forty-four thousand doesn't be preached to and brought out of captivity taking interactor and then come back in the Millennium so that's the culmination of the seventy weeks of Daniel according to this and this he's got to restore what people and the city he's got to restore both not just one both that's where people don't if you'll give if you get this revelation that this seventy weeks is for two things not one not just for the people is for the people and the rebuilding of the city a man comin into even in a millennium they're gonna have a natural temple built its ego 4244 brother Brown said that's the natural temple being built in the Millennium alright so now so 70 research terminal on by people and upon the holy city so we know when I read that you're gonna stay Jews in Jerusalem right so he's going to restore two things inside of this and seventy weeks of that to do six things what is that to finish the transgression but the transgression they made will go through all these but you got to set a background to make an end of sin alright what preach the gospel to them save this all right and make reconciliation for iniquity restoration I like this too I was reading the commentary and the guy did a good job he's not even a message believer but he did the commentary he said he said these six things there's three negatives and three positives and that's true the negative is finished what transgression is a negative sin as a negative and iniquity is negative but righteousness is the positive vision is positive prophecy and the whole is is a positive so you got just like justification sanctification about enzyme a holy ghost what puts us in the body to make finish the transgression make an MCN reconcile their iniquity that saved Israel now to bring in everlasting righteousness means that all they're saying is finished alright seal up the vision and prophecy is this a vision right even jesus said coming down from the mountain we preached on the last sunday at brother Boone jesus said tell this vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again well it was a natural happening but it was the vision there was a there was a meaning here in Daniel 70 weeks it's just like them it's just like a it's a parable just like the sort of the see this is the parable because seventy weeks are already over like I said the natural seventy weeks to the Jews are already over they already come out of captivity back then that was promised from Jeremiah we're reading next sunday when we'll get into Jeremiah free or we already ready for hand and eye on you note said two years will be gone and and all that stuff in Jeremiah said no 70 year all right so 70 70 years are seventy weeks are determined all right to do all and go north the most holy now let me just give you a little key to chew on because it's going to be six months before we get to this part but this seats whole purpose proves to you that there's one week left after the rapture of the church for the Jewish people not three and a half years I said natural earthly time because when the prophets finished preaching that 1260 day Ministry of the two prophets of Israel in the middle of that last week what happens they get cut off and killed now were you going to get there relaxing righteousness while it's still down here under under bondage and there's no Battle of Armageddon how you going to knock the most holy in that three and a half year you can it's got to be a time left over a man it's where you going to get a whole week left the Bible says in the holy like all right cuz right here it is know that for and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto them aside and we'll get into the dates a little bit later on so from the restoration and rebuilding of Jerusalem unto who Jesus shall be seven weeks one period all right you want to make sure you should look on your chart brother Luigi okay I know I know okay below there's where your there's a seven-week period right there sixty two week period right there one week here here there's three periods she'll be seven weeks will tell you what goes on in flights divided okay and threescore and two what's three scoring 262 three score is three times two alright got that sixty two weeks the street shall be built again in a wall even in trouble this time and after sixty two weeks shall Messiah be cut off when at Calvary right after sixty two weeks on my size cut off you see it right here 8030 you see the cross program do the cross up there but not for himself in the pillion said but not for himself and the people to prance you're coming shoulders draw the city in sanctuary so now let's look the Jewish people their Redemption listen to them was destroyed at Calvary because they turn him down all right they cut him off chubby 72 it's the streets revealed in Africa least 12 weeks shall Messiah be cut off what he was killed they said let his blood be on us on our children all right but not for himself he didn't get killed for itself he got killed for us man and the people the prince that shall come now that's not the same aside that's not that Prince that's a capital this Prince is a little and who was that Titus Titus came in in 80 70 and destroyed the city took the menorah took the holiest of Holies the art took everything and hold it back to Rome so you know who's got all that now Romans got it all Rome's got everything groans got every piece that Jerusalem are the Jews need to put that temple back together that's why and the sanctuary the end thereof should be with the flood to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week now who's that little age Antichrist the Pope the Pope is going to make a covenant with meaning what many of the Jews Lashley's go make a covenant little boy in the world remember it's going to be peace and all that stuff and all he's coming in with flattery for how long one wig and brother branham said and we can prove it but we're going to go back into Jacob one week at seven years one week equals seven years if I got that so that's why you can take seven weeks 7 7 is 49 is on your chart hmm 49 year and three scoring 2 is 434 so seven and 62 is 69 they were determined how many weeks 7d so there's one week left we don't see this covenant made with the Jews we've gone in a rapture so the Bible proves we can stop right there there's one there's one week left Africa after the search for the Jewish people and the city not for the three and a half year in ministry of jesus christ the 1260 days that's inside of the seventy weeks of Daniel but that's not all as most people in the message say there's only three and a half years left of Daniel seventy weeks after the rapture that is incorrect that is false and it's not true there's three and a half years of Jesus ministry the stream half years of tribulation but there's not three and a half of the season one my plan is the Bible I want to go by the Bible and he the Antichrist brother Graham said we do not see him make this covenant with the Jews were gone so there's one week left after the rapture of the church just exactly what he said and in the midst of the week how long is that three and a half years he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation see what's going to happen is you know what he's going to do with this covenant brother right he's gonna give them their menorah he's going to give them their art he's going to give them the things and they're going to reestablish temple worship and then after three and a half years the Pope's going to walk into that temple and he's going to say no you're not going worship that God you're going to worship me I'm the god you're looking for the Antichrist but he's telling them he's the guy well guess what them Jews are not going to have a part of that at all so we going to cause the sacrifice an oblation to cease for the overspreading of abominations shall make it desolate even into the consummation and that term in shall be poured out on this desolate because remember after that 1260 days when the Jews take a rapture is the Battle of Armageddon right that's the next thing in order is the Battle of Armageddon so now that you've got all that you can chew on it a little while I know somebody's looking cross-eyed at me but that's okay because we're going to prove it by Daniel let's go to our book paragraph number one in the gables instruction today on first page first paragraph let's read it right here all right good morning friends is very hot being the tabernacle this morning but very glorious to be here so glad that we could can get in today for this service and I'm given out that I'd have a have a study now on this seventy weeks of Daniel that ties the rest of the message before I can go with the seal seven sealed which there seven seals seven plagues seven trumpets free woes woman in the Sun casting the other end dragon the 144,000 sealed all happening between this time what the Daniel seventy weeks yeah what he said and I thought I'd have to get this in first all right now let's go over to paragraph 27 let's go to 20 let's read 22 because i want you to see what go road round says now now this morning we have a great lesson and tonight it will try to continue going if the Lord laying next Sunday another into it got it very got 22 capable instructions to Daniel we got 22 on page 22 paragraph 22 yeah that's one of this red now now this morning we have a great lesson there by got it very got 22 the paragraphs are always going to be the same paragraph 22 in paragraph 2622 paragraph 22 don't worry about page numbers we're not going to call page numbers because they're not exactly the same paragraph 22 got it now now this morning we have a great lesson and tonight we'll try to continue it on and if the Lord willing next sunday and into it so what he's doing is this morning he's preaching on Gabriel construction to Daniel the afternoon service was the six full purpose and then he preaches on the seven two weeks ago next Sunday all right I want to get these things clear in our mind because listen this is a hard subject in the message for people to understand but let me tell you something so i got totally they got real mad at me but i really don't care see it matter to me when it comes to the Word of God listen if one word got us out of the garden if we're one word off its not going to not save your soul this is not Salvation issue but this is a growth issue if I got that not a Salvation issue you can be born again and never here at nine seventy weeks but long people have but you cannot maturing God because there's always going to be a question in your mind listen the problem with us is we have questions the thing about Jesus when he walked on the faces were earth he had 20 questions of who he was 0 man 0 we have questions but I want to try to answer one question that's in the people's mind brother ground said many times he said I'm trying to answer a question and people find all right sunday another in 2070 week I didn't know how deep it was getting until I got to studying it and it's still a mystery for me yet while the placing of those weeks now you'll see he'll say that he looked at dr. Yurok Smith dr. Larkin has a chart which I'm going to bring in it's close but it's not perfect it's close but you'll see where brother em says they're both they both they all have something a little off but one's brother Brown brought here to do top all loosen that means he didn't leave one man and it's still a mystery to me yet so I'm just depending on the Lord so now let's go to paragraph 27 forgot 27 if I got her got 27 just looking through a little numbers down paragraph 27 should say and now I think if the children want to go to the room all right in other words there are some of the Sunday School in the room for full people so nice so let's go down to says if the little fellas would cooperate with us as this morning we are having starting a great tremendous message you see nobody puts emphasis on the dance there in two weeks but this with a tremendous message to the profit that I'm sure that will mean a great deal to your father and mother and your loved ones that's here and even to you little one so we approach it very reverently all right let's go to a paragraph 29 says next Sunday the lord willing I want to place the reason and the time of the seven church ages and what time they are and where we are standing today that's on next morn Sunday morning the Lord willing now here's a key read the next paragraph here third paragraph 30 now the reason for this I've brought down some little notes from my last few messages and this morning I want to lap over because this is on magnetic tape them go all over the world and always the reason I lap it back perhaps somebody listen to the table he says many many times even over on the next page will read next week he says lap over now why do you say lap over well look you've got left over here they got your chart he's got a lap over look 80 70 laps over end of the church age all right the Jews coming back is returning during the time of the Gentiles that's a lap over all your church ages have leftovers the church age is one didn't abruptly stopped in another one start you see the circles alright like this but those circles should be actually like this and I'm not trying your uncle the Holy Spirit drew the thing on the wall and I'm not trying to redraw it but brother Ram tops by lap over so there's a lap over and it will be very important when we get over here further for you to understand that God doesn't abruptly stop something and then start something else what he gives time remember he said you're going to be embodies for one of years well he give him for him 30 he lacked it over same way with here after Jesus was killed he given to 80 70 because remember jesus said in Matthew 24 he said if you see this abomination you get out of the city brother brahim said in AD 70 there was not one believer inside that city man there was not a holy ghost filled believer inside that city why they listen to what God said but the people that were in that city eat their babies to stay alive so you see what listening to what God said will do for you alright so there it's so lap over there's leftovers to all this all right back everyone's dead man hurts your feelings cuz you know one he's giving me time he's giving you time he's give all of us time man so we we I like it when he says lap over you know what lap over does write your lap went like a stair-step never brother I'm said you can't build a stair set without what building one on top of the other one well this is your lap over right here to build the next step then there's another lap over sitting on top of that step to build an excellent so you know got it you know what to me the lap of rest grac e the lap over is grave do you know why brother Graham said if I Scott I just say you're gonna do if you don't did that day you're done right you know what he said he said I was God I'd say you believe me one time and forget it that's what he said he said but God is gracious and he give this time so we have a lap over in the church ages and lap over in the damn Cemetery so now let's go to paragraph 31 now this is going to be very important right here I got 31 says we have been now for months everybody got that we have been now from us in the state of the book of Revelation to revelation of Jesus Christ remember he came right out of the church agents and preached this a little bit later three student he's been on the church ages and now he's come into that instead of the week we have been out for months in the study of the book of Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ we have come through the church ages the first three chapters of Revelation was the church ages then John was caught up in the fourth and fifth chapter and was show things that was to be here after now in the sixth chapter he drops down in the earth again the seating is taking place that will go from the sixth chapter the first verse until the nineteenth chapter in the 21st verse in here comes in two seals to place the oils the locusts one and some cash cow red dragon sitting away up 144,000 and all these things alright then I understand that one of these revelations one program city the bride takes a rapture revelations for one member he joins caught up and then in four and five shows where he's at shows how they got their revelations five that's Redemption but revelation 6 1 is to the Jews you say well the seals are us the spiritual part of the deal to rise the natural partner to the Jews but from revelation 6 12 revelations 1921 is all Jewish you said what about revelation 10-7 dunno mighty angel go over there that the mighty angel come down the Bible says even in daniel says that Michael the mighty angel will fight for Israel will there's revelation 10m coming down you should all what about level revelation 10-7 John is telling us how how it transpired in the days of the voice of the seventh angel in other words wouldn't get a revelation of the mystery and it will cause all these things to happen very simple to me but it needs to be simple to you too and fuel pray ought to make it simple that's right but I'm not a smart guy you know that I just try to read and stay listen to what the Lord said and you do the same thing do you know why you don't just speak to me speak to y'all all right thing everybody got that revelations for one or even revelation 6 to revelations 19 is to the Jews and it happens in this 70th week of Daniel if I got that right alright let's read paragraph 2 36 and then we'll stop right there will read paragraph 36 and 37 and then I won't open up by five minutes per question we got 36 and different ones has figured it out they've had it way back one fell I was reading and it all ended up in 1919 of the 70 weeks well that wasn't so after 17 weeks after 70 weeks it's authentic so we don't we want to know the truth and I'm asking God to give me the trip now in order to go to back this up go back I want to rehearse a little bit of the back so therefore some notes that i jot it down that we have in the fifth for the fifth chapter which people will understand first before we do this I want to lap it over so that you can get it from the fort now remember the third chapter was allowed to interchange and the church was taken up at the up at the end of layout of the cell alright let's read now paragraph 40 now what happens is brother branham why me this is how do you expect our people which are pouring mandame uneducated to understand such as this very got 40 I said God will give the answer alright so we depend on God to give us the answer no matter how complicated it is God can break it down and make it simple for where a portion of those people who are longing praying for that day in that hour and our eyes are set towards heaven and we're watching friends coming and I'm just sure that he will show us now it won't tell us the day or hour because no man knows that but it will certainly tell us the day on the week we're living if we can just get to it alright so we kind of covered a lot today but it will go to back up we're going to lap over ourselves and we will start next Sunday on Daniel 9 verse 1 because see what happened is Daniel goes to pray it he verse 3 I set my face until the Lord garden seat by prayer and supplication with fasting in sackcloth and ashes Daniel confessed his sins maybe that's what we ought to do maybe already clear our you know get her you're a plate clear as we say and and ask God to forgive us of our sins they will speak to you got sending you left remember what brother Brown said he said you won't get your healing unless you take care of that right there so that's what we're stopping that lady or whoever it was to getting from getting healed plus some time confess sin so let's just kind of clear everything up and you know what then God's obligated he's obligated to show it to us in a simple form that will all be able to understand it all right any questions one would you prefer to study ahead or stay with you you read the book I want you to read the book so you're familiar with the book keep just read the whole book make a little note drop things down and do like that said when he first read it you put question marks beside me you know he started reading the book he put a question mark and then maybe we can answer that question but I want you to read and be familiar with all three services together so listen listen to them at home or watch them on your computer at home and then you leave your book here if you want to do that but whichever one to make this a little note because you know what listen there's got to be questions because we were covering this over and over and over again I know we got some new people here but we keep covering this we covered it for 30-some years that had some people still don't really try to really try to understand it I think we have to try to understand this and get it in our mind that when we go out there and talk to people and they said well you know that's the first thing they tell you well brother don't believe there's only three and a half years left the raptor that's not true that's not true I mean brother Dale bleeds or seven years left after after there is there's not just three and a half years of ministry there's only three and a half years of ministry left corner in the Bible but according to the Bible we just read there's one week left after that Antichrist makes a covenant with a juice so Bible's Bible brother Brown said face final resting places in the word were you letting the word but brother branham I promise you didn't say anything different than the word you just misunderstood when said well like he said somebody said you said seven years he sit down no no no no no you misunderstood okay he knew that person was were taken we don't do that he knew that person was thinking there were seven years men left and there's not just threaten thats what stops everybody we read all the quotes for the ones that they bring and I don't like that they had weed but the one that they bring you know it's true but he never said no no no no this is my whole point my brother branham went to the seven seals there were some things that he was preaching that was wrong and God corrected him and he told us that God corrected him never in that book find me one place where he said I was wrong and Daniel Pham you waiting find me one place he said no no no same quote no no no he said you misunderstood what I said I didn't say it like that in other words he said that God I misunderstood whether that he said it was wrong hey I came across one just the other day that I had not read and they had an underline and bold letters brother Ram said that's what the Holy Spirit put on my pan to ride that they would one week left Africa after sure you hire you with the Holy Ghost are you okay I'm not going to argue with it the person was sad drennan seven years ministry and it's not going to help you all right let's go
