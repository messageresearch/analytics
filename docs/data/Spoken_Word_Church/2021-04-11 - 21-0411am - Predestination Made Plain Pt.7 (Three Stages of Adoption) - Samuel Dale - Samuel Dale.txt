galatians three we're going to read from three and four but just to take it from from that point and move on in the lord and trying to see something about what we've we've been speaking on and uh pray that the lord has blessed you and all of the things so just remember that remember the lord willing wade will be ministering this afternoon and then he's going to get back in the rotation on the wednesdays so he'll be ministering wednesdays so we're getting all this set back in order and getting ready and we're going to try one of these days to get back into the sunday school class and get them to go and and then get back into the bible study and especially i i'm thrilled to find out that people want to go back to the bible study where we can sit down and fellowship and and question one another and have a good time in the lord and we always do that on a saturday afternoon where you can just get together and do but but it's good to be amen uh good houses to esther back with us we've had to see her able to get out and going and everybody so just pray one for another pray for brother ray uh sister kathy said this morning he was still in bad shape so remember him and pray that the lord would would lead him out of this and uh they're trying to get set to where the uh sister mary and the family and all of them can try to get over here you know to the states and all and they're trying to get in all of those things so remember that and then brother george smith just remember him all of us know brother george that's brother branham's son-in-law and we pray that the lord would reach down and touch him said he had the pneumonia part so that's that's part of it that's what makes it hard on you is it'll attack one certain thing and then you're in trouble with that and uh knowing firsthand that we were there and can talk about it but yet still we can believe too and accept the lord for whatever okay uh i'm just having to take one at the time till i get my notes over with and doing so just remember that so let's go let's pray and then go to our scriptures in galatians father we thank you for the day and the time that we have that we can just stop a little bit and kind of take a little time off from the hustle and bustle of working and life and doing and just sat down and meditate on you talk about you and hear from you and that you lord manifest yourself to each and every one of us we pray that you would just bless all of these remember the sick ones among us we pray continually for all of these that were called out this morning the sicknesses and things remember brother ray to touch him the lord and all of that with the heart attack and just take it and make it all work out for your honor and glory and we believe you and we thank you and brother george smith i pray that you god would take you'll be with him and take care of him and all of the people as we read your word you come on the scene and manifest yourself in a mighty way to each and every one we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen all right let's start reading about what we got 16 we'll read this and then going into the four four go from three into four where you get the whole story all right so we start in about 50 let's start the 15. brother and i speak after the manner of men though if it be but a man's covenant yet if it is confirmed no man disannounced or added there unto now to abraham and his seed were the promises made notice one seed not seeds not plural just one seed and that seed is jesus christ we know that he saith not enter seeds as of many but as a one and are thy seed which is christ and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was 430 years after cannot discipline null that it should make the promises of non-effect because see the law was was spiritual we needed it it had to be brought in to to come to the bases but then now you're going to see heresy that you're going to pick up something under the law well maybe the right way to say something but we'll pick up a positional understanding under the law of the spiritual that is to come to pass and then that way you'll be able to follow in the doing for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise but god gave it to abraham by promise now remember what we had and i keep dropping back into the previous messages remember why god chose abraham remember why that happened that way you remember the the messages we tried to preach that he wasn't a special guy with it but he loved god and god looked down at a man and said now that's the man i want because he loved god no matter what god done he still loved god so then remember your your choosing is on the basis of maybe something you do have in life because he can look at you we'll get to that later in the message he can look at you and see if whether or not he loves you but he loved abraham he loved david he loved those great men but it was because they all loved him and had their heart set on him so don't forget those things all right wherefore then serveth the law in other words was the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator now mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been had there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have come by the law but the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise now that's jew or gentile don't make no difference we're all under sin yeah all right that we prom that the promise by faith of jesus christ might give unto them that believe now remember what it was with abraham he believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but before faith came we were kept under the law in other words were kept by book of rules it was a book of rules the law was don't do this don't do that it was a book of rules then we were kept under that shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed now watch him wherefore the law was our school master to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith now the law was a school master it's very important what is the school master somebody teaches you the the you know algebra science or whatever math schoolmaster all right so then think about it wherefore the law was our teacher our director our controller uh what all could you put with it for what forth to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we're no longer under a schoolmaster the law came to last until jesus christ then when christ came christ being the end of the law for righteousness to them that believe so when christ came he was a fulfillment of the law he was the law made manifest in an alive word we'll get down to some of those things later on all right for year all the children now what of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ therefore it is neither jew nor greek there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you're all one in christ jesus now what about paul's taking the whole law of all before him all the things and he's bringing it down to a situation to showing you how gracious the law is and why we needed it all right now for if we be christ for if ye be christ in your abraham's seed and ours according to the promise now watch him now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all now paul you made that personal you said now i say he made it personal it was something real to him he knew what he was talking about right now come on now i say that there is error as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all now what something's got to come on the scene but it's under tutors schoolmasters same word look it up and governors this is up and downs of what the schoolmaster really is until a time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye our sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying out by father for for thou art no more a servant no watch but a son and if a son then an hour of god through christ you may be seated lord add his blessing to the word think on these things you can just keep reading the word of god get your mind in a channel and see that you can go from one chapter to the next chapter to the next chapter in understanding and doing and following it now paul being a great scholar that he was you don't see you see peter explaining after paul brings forth the things you see peter bringing forth things that fit therein and the prophet said peter and paul said the same thing they were not different in doctrine they taught the same thing all right now but see paul he takes the old testament and he's looking at the old testament he's seeing that here was man coming into the world you know natural man natural people and walking in the best that they could do and it looks like that you know that god says well now that that ain't good enough i'll have to give him something to do so he gives the law no the law was asked for by mankind right mankind asked for the law he sought the law because it's just like he sought a king i mean the people did paul knows these stories they sought a king to be ruler over them which was never to be right they sought a law in the basis of saying give us something to do well god gives mankind the law but here's the problem the bible says the law is spiritual paul speaking but i'm i'm carnal i mean the law is the word of god amen see they made the law a book of rules it's not a book of rules you say yes it is because it tells you thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill thy shall not do it but mankind made it that right it is not that the prophet said the the ten commandments was the seals of the old testament and palsy said it the law is spiritual the law was the word of god man made it a book of rules it was never to have been a book of rules it was never to have been thou shalt not kill thy shalt not steal you're reading it differently brother gary atkins used to say it that way it it sounds different if you read it different you know and you read where it says thou shalt not steal well see that's the great ten commandments form of on the mountain and the writing of the commandments and the things you know a great human voice you know thundering out and see you read it like that you read thy shall not kill i shall not steal but read it a little different read it thou shalt not kill right that shall not steal he said well you said the same thing the wording is the same but the meaning behind it is not the same right then you begin to find out what the the law and what it was made for and paul was bringing it out to the galatians and showing them that we were under school masters teachers all right the law became our school master paul said i wouldn't have known unless i did i wouldn't have known sin if it hadn't been for sin thou shalt not lust or et cetera see you know you get started on something and then you say well i can't i get on that i got to go somewhere else so because see the law is the word of god it's not a book of rules that's right man made it the book of rules because that's what he wanted his biggest mistake in exodus what is it 19 is that what it is it's an exodus where man chose law and i illustrated it like see they chose a king they chose a king see it was never god's intentions to give them a king it was not god's intentions to give a law the prophet was all they needed if they'd have just listened all right but you see then you take it and you take adoption and you try to bring in adoption because that was what paul used in the the galatians all right now brother bob the other night done a good point of brain it i'd always made that statement but i just never did uh go back and prove because i thought it was just uh you know a normal thing that people understood that because that's what we understood and i was in the baptist church we understood that uh you know adoption was the thing that was brought over from the gentile situation are really the romans and brought into the situation of of uh you know being part of their rules and regulations but it was not an original adopting uh thing it was not original from it the jews didn't take it to the romans the romans brought it to the to the jews and it became in in bread into their uh teachings and doings because when you would go into bondage to a king of another country then he would teach you his laws his rules his regulations and you would wind up a lot of times even if you went free from that king you don't wind up taking some of that with you because you had it for hundreds of years and it was okay see now what's my point because i'm just i'm just plain of saying it see had not this been brought from the romans you would not have had adoptional teachings into the israeli or israel so thank god for it but see god didn't give them what they wanted they wanted a book of rules i keep saying that but he didn't give them that he gave them his word thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal brother branham picked it up and brought it to exactly placing it with the seals in his message with the seals is not a book of rules what is the seals it's a revelation of jesus christ so what was the law under the old testament a revelation of what god would come forth into making himself one day to be a man to walk on this earth right because everything he dealt with in the in the ten commandments is dealing with something about jesus christ if you place it correctly i remember years ago i was studying on marriage and divorce or something and i got in it in my thoughts i got connected into the right channel of understanding and i could see those uh those ten commandments this is beautiful and see how it come right down to where we're at now see then paul would say the law is spiritual in other words the law was right they just took it wrong he said they didn't get what they thought they got they got a revelation of jesus christ in letter form called the ten commandments you know what i just can't do that i can't i can't see the prophet said it i didn't he said if you don't if you read the bible and don't see jesus christ in every verse of the bible go back and read it again you missed something right now that's pretty strong but it's true because the bible is to bring forth god to us or to reveal god to make himself known that was his purpose and doings and and what took place and why he would come down through that and do these things and even give the people things that that he knew that was going to kill them but that's what they wanted see they wanted a king samuel said if i ever told you anything was wrong have i ever done anything no we just want a king we'll be like the rest well that was the biggest mistake they could make between the fact of choosing a king and choosing a law the way they got it the way they thought it was was the most damaging effect that anything could ever had upon mankind it left mankind or made mankind a sinner you know sin wasn't imputed where there was no transgression of the law in other words backing up into there there was a time that sin was not imputed well yeah it computed after the adam's transgression yeah but not it's not like it is now it it was the fact you see those things in a beautiful picture if you see jesus christ in that verse instead of seeing everything else all right so then what we're doing we're taking galatians to see that paul is picking this up from the old testament teachings you know he's picking up the law he's bringing it in he's picking up that the law is a schoolmaster to bring us to christ he's still telling us that the law winds up being our tutor our governor which was appointed to us to raise us all right now but the romans they picked that up i mean the jews picked it up from the romans and bringing it on into this point and paul would be the one to go back over here and bring all of this out and show us this was the revelation of jesus christ the law was a revelation of jesus christ and seeing those things now what's my point i wanna i wanna i wanna throw you a curve i believe in teach and i believe the prophet did and i believe paul did i mean peter did i'm just saying it that way but i i'm going to tell you i believe it i believe in there's three stages of grace not steps of grace now you don't have that stages and steps is different just don't try to make it and because you can't take the first church age and lay it with the first seal you can't you can compare but you cannot put them totally parallel because you'd wind up in bad shape maybe that don't click to you but it clicks in me to understand one thing god spent all of that time trying to bring down to you and i his understanding of himself and sin then to do it he brought it in because let me ask it this way i don't mean just to raise your hand i don't do it because you get yourself in trouble with your own thoughts just be right what do you believe about adoption a lot of people have never heard about adoption they've never heard it taught they don't know what adoption is and that's what's so funny that we taught adoption in the baptist church and i knew in the baptist church that the romans brought over that we we took that when israel was captivated by the romans and the people they took those things and brought them into their daily routines and their doings and and things of of life right brother bob he run the whole thing through for you so that was good all right we see we knew that then wha wha what went wrong with the people of this message that said we don't understand adoption well you know maybe you just never read the book right maybe you never read the bible and thought about it i mean see they picked up those things and from the roman government and people and they called it a schoolmaster that's what paul would pick up in galatians because he knew what that was he knew what those things was that's why he would call it a tutor a tutor is a razor and and we know the story are supposed to of of adoption that a child born into the family you know he's a child at birth but yet he's given a tutor a razor to raise him to bring him to a position that he can come to a situation to where god can say this is my son in whom i'm pleased to dwell right and seeing that jesus christ went through the exact example of of this adoption but jesus went with three stages then you think jesus taught three stages of adoption we babbed just talked two stages i wonder what the message people's teaching well we don't even fool with that because we don't know yeah that's the truth see if i ask you to express the three stages of grace you could probably remember it from a tape you heard or from this that or the other or thoughts and ideas talked of all right that's good that's all right but really do you understand it do you understand that there's three stages but yet those natural romans never taught the third stage the natural jew even though he knew of those stages and what was going on he never taught the third stage of adoption but it might be interesting to find out the third stage well i know what it is it's the redemption of the body amen all right we're good but where's your example there's no example in the old testament because there's no death burial resurrection to be counted in the old testament sure there was people raised from the dead right we will bring that there was people raising the dead in the old testament but there was not a resurrection in the old testament maybe that's why you had the pharisees and sadducees of the trouble do you know what the difference between a pharisee and a sadducee i mean do you really know the difference between a pharisee and a sadducee that was two groups that was all that paul was fighting against pharisees sadducees had a little problem with the herodians in a different little situation but it was mainly pharisees and sadducees you know the difference in the pharisees the sadducees pharisee believes in a resurrection a sadducee doesn't believe in the resurrection hold on that's what i'm talking i'm standing here talking about somewhere in the 58 59 60 in the baptist church that i knew thing because you could study the word god that's why the pharisees and sadducees were constantly after each other now the sadducees it wasn't they didn't believe in the resurrection they didn't believe in the resurrection the way the pharisees believed it the sadducees believed that there would be a final resurrection but the pharisees they believed that it was our working through some way that they could not explain it because it was something they had picked up and was guided about in their doings but they couldn't put it together enough to say but they argued over it go back and read your bible the sadducees argued about the fact that there would be a resurrection but you believed you never noticed where mary was yes lord we know in the resurrection the everybody looked for a resurrection but the resurrection was looked at after being like job job believed in a resurrection i know that my lord liveth in one day but see what did job need he needed a personal experience with somebody you ever heard the prophet say it this way he said he always wanted the fact of saying that he could take some man that would reach over here and get almighty god and reach over here and get him and bring them together and make them one well that's exactly what the lord jesus went up doing right he took god and man and put it together through the new birth and brought it amen see job was looking for a resurrection i know my redeemer liveth but when god got through with job job wasn't saying i know because that that's a odd word see you say i know well that could just be you you've got a good thoughts you got a good idea no get look it up that word says no there means i have an experience or a situation of this in my own life job knew that there was going to be a resurrection of a man but he couldn't explain it how could he there was no way to explain it but he said i know my redeemer liveth amen in the last days not in the resurrection he was looking for something some of those people were spiritual enough to find out that they needed to look for a resurrection there what good is the resurrection tomorrow the next day get something personal and look at it and see see job could get the idea and come up he could talk about with it a little bit in the basis of the third stage of redemption or adoption interchangeable words he said what are you trying to get us to see brother dale i'm trying to get me and you to see one thing do we understand can we put it in the message can we put it in the bible can we put what we talk about in the bible and the baptist come along preach job in the resurrection well i don't know about this resurrection this is this adoptions and things that just that's beyond me that's too deep for me it is where you've been reading your bible that's right shoot real fast why don't you take galatians and let paul line up now if you don't get nothing to message today get this little point let paul line up with those old testament saints now the jews knowing that they come from the romans with their idea of adoption and he's dealing with them on some on something they can understand so he goes through the galatians and he explains the tutor the governors the schoolmasters we'll get this if we don't we'll get in another message somewhere down the road i've got plenty to preach on anyway but you see paul was explaining to those natural jews you have tucked this you know they couldn't argue with him because they knew he knew what he talked about you've taken this from the romans and they're right they're supposed to be a fact in the doctrinal issue that a child is a child when it was born into the family and then adoption was when the child was tutored or trained and brought to a position and adopted all right now that's as far as paul goes with galatians because that's two stages whether he didn't know or whether god kept him from preaching i don't know because i know in romans i can prove he did he knew in three or three all stages but that's what i'm getting at what are you paul was saying okay we're under these things you you galatians you desire to be under the law you need to stay spiritual instead of wanting to go back under see these galatians had got brought over from the law into the revelation or time frame of the new testament situation and it was beginning to understand and paul is explaining to them the situation of what had happened he was not concerned with explaining the resurrection his concern was to explain the new birth and then the point going with the new birth to bring you into adoption authorities and things because we'll prove it as we go along if we have to just keep taking message after message but seeing the romans you'll find the identification of of a christian amen romans 1 i mean romans 8 but then he goes from identification brought into the family he goes to the authority second stage authority of bringing the child up through tutors and trainers and raisers and governors now you see what he's doing back here to the galatians but see paul takes romans to the next stage and see you you've got to hold romans to be your finality of all things because even peter in his teachings of the stature of a perfect man which was wonderful and marvelous to bring forth the stages of adoption but it never took the stages of adoption to the redemption of the body peter never took it to there paul was the only one taking it fully into the full redemption the others could came forth and you know and do he said well i don't understand you know why don't you understand what is it you don't understand it's right in the word of god paul takes the galatians and carries them through stage one and stage two puts the tutors the governors the trainers the school masters all of those things into the the child because under the old roman part the child was born into the family when the jews picked it up and brought it on into their understanding a child would be born into the family i was a dale when i was born into the family i didn't have to join it i didn't have to do anything to get there i was born into the family of the dales well but then you was to be given tutors and and raisers to bring you up to bring you to the full authority because the second stage will come into manifestation or full authority well they hear him on finality but even jesus when he went to hear him he was still short of one thing oh you're getting too known jesus was still short of the resurrection at that moment he was not bringing it to that the prophet on the statue of a perfect man said thirty-something years i've been preaching this go back through the messages in there hear him and and all of those things and and some of where we've been talking about where pentecost failed and what those things were and all go back and study those things and see if you can find out where you're at right what stage are you in it's got to be three stages that's why it's it's not three steps steps won't work it's stages it's a stage means you can go from this and the same person go to the next stage into the next stage and goes through into your correct order all right what are you following me policy in you galatians you desire to be under the law you want to go back to them things when you didn't even understand it when you was there the law was speaking of the the lord jesus christ to come into being is that true is that what the prophet quoted a moment ago if you don't see christ in every verse or jesus may be you know excuse unless it says christ because he didn't say jesus cause you can't see jesus never verse don't get smart with me you don't see jesus in every verse you know the name jesus the name jesus no but you see christ in every verse of the bible if you don't see it you better get started reading with a little bit understanding about what you're talking about to see christ all right listen even though as i said peter could do such a marvelous job in the statue of a perfect man add to your faith virtual knowledge to impressions come out to love which is the headstone yet when he comes to that still he's missing one thing he's missing the change of the body peter never taught you up to the stage he taught you up to let's see how to say it he never taught you the change of the body he taught you the comp the uh overruling of the body that be a good word for overruling of the body or the rule of the body through the virtues it's the rule this person that we are that's what your virtues are for the statue of a perfect man but brother dale i've just never heard nobody teach well where have you been see that makes you a smart addict all right i'll accept the fact of being an elect but don't cleave me of being smart because i ain't smart if i smart i'd just go sit down in a pew and about 50 years ago i would have sat there and said brother moat you're gonna preach from now on and i did one time i quit preaching some of you my wife knows it some of you the kids may remember that i quit preaching for a while because see i wasn't a preacher i never did count myself as being now so i quit brother mark said what are you going to do i said i'm going to church if i'm going to back you up with everything i can do i'll cut to grace i'll paint the church i'll do all the works i'll do everything in the world and i did but he said what if i get sick i said i believe in praying for the sick but you see the lord put it in a different situation brought it different but that's all right because brother mo told me he's preached statue of a perfect man i'm throwing no reflection to him or what he says or i'm saying i'm just trying i'm telling truth the brother won't finish the statue of a perfect man i ask him one question i ask you that question today how do you get those virtues richard come up to me one day and he said i didn't know it was a commandment or a necessity that we had to get the requirement didn't know it was a requirement for me to get these virtues well that's what they're saying you're required to have them right you see there ain't going to be no change in the body so you're going to be pharisees and sadducees arguing with each other over which one's got the doctrine and neither one of them got it laid out right through the pharisees believe in the resurrection sadducees you read what you do and they'll tell you they didn't believe in the resurrection but it wasn't a resurrection that way it was a resurrection for something happening that the pharisees were getting some idea that something was going to take place they had a little idea when jesus christ rose that they had some thoughts about that with the pharisees we don't believe in the resurrection you say so you bring out stuff like that and you drive me crazy cause i don't know what you're talking about well just listen just listen to what i'm talking about if you don't know ask me a question that's what i'll be glad to get back to where we can have the questions and answers i enjoy questions and answers we wouldn't have questions and answered every service here if we could handle it but we can at least handle it once a month where we can get together and but i've told you over and over every time i preach a series what i do questions and answers right every time i get through with a group of things or messaging what i say let's have questions and answers i'm open to questions anytime right off the pulpits coming floor right off the floor it doesn't bother me for you to say something you say brother dale i don't agree with you well praise god now tell me why maybe that can help me cause you can help me to get right because if i'm wrong i can listen to you don't ever worry about the fact you'll hurt this man's feelings if you question him what you do is when you go among yourselves to talk one over to another about what you don't agree now you've hurt my feelings because you owe me the point of coming to me well brother dale i've tried to now don't start that silly stuff brother dale i've tried to talk to you and you wouldn't talk to me i've made one rule around here and that one rule i've always stuck with and i will stick with that rule i cannot go out there after service today and stop with one person and stay there for an hour before you go home you say my pastor he just my pastor just oh he would just always run up to me you've got anything on your mind brother let's talk about it well there's the rest of the congregation gone i'm not gonna do that i got a home you got a home we got phones call me up we'll sit down talk all week amen but when i go outside out there i shake hands with everybody i can you ain't never noticed that you've taught it you put it there and you'll see it i even shake or do the bumps with the kids i want everybody to be to realize one thing we're just a body of jesus christ i am nothing he said well you're my pastor that's what you make me come on i got some things on the gifts from college where brother random says he said the way you treat your pastor is the way god will treat you well i ain't trying to give me a i you know what do you need brother i need a new cadillac i could say it and get it and don't have to worry about it but that ain't what i'm talking about i'm talking about there's not one here any bigger than anybody else i don't care who you are how old you are and how much you think you know the message you ain't no different than anybody else that's in this building except for one thing if you're right about studying the message you got that much on your side oh okay but you understand paul explains the old testament relationship of adoption but he only explains two stages peter picks up and gets more into the new testament form because he's dealing with the spiritual man coming forth and telling you how that's what i asked brother mold i said how do i get these virtues that was my question that's my question to you do you know how to get to virtuous well i didn't know i needed now you know what solve that problem we got that one out of the way now let's go see how do we get those virtues now the prophet says they're automatically added but then he'll turn around and said this can't be automatically added so now you got to get it right how's it automatically added but it's not automatically added it's not laying there just throw it out there to you no it's there for you to stir it up right it's there for to get it stirred up and get you to study in the word and praying and seeking god the virtues are then automatically brought i wish i could get it sometime as i was riding across the road one time i wish i could get it together in my mind again to preach it of whether i could see the virtues and how they was coming forth see you take faith and virtue you put them together and you got knowledge as long as you've got the right faith and the right virtue you put them together you've got knowledge now you're gaining ground faith works your knowledge now you've got something you understand it's laying there but get what i'm saying the romans taught the israel's people in their days and doings and the israel people picked it up brought it over but even though the lord jesus christ walked upon this earth it never brought a new birth to a person he had to go give his life and open it up to where he can give it to you and make you a child of god because that's the first stage the romans taught it the correct way the first stage is you're born into the family hey joe your name is joe you're this you're a dale you know go hey come on you're in the family then they put a tutor over you're a razor someone to train you a school teacher think about these school teachers and what they're doing teaching you those things what is a school what is the school master in the stature of a perfect man don't tell me that you're going to listen to a fellow that don't have any virtue at all explain to you about virtue and you you say well we got virtue yeah yeah yeah we got that no no no no it's when god reveals it and makes it manifest right then we got it all right okay because remember my point now three stages so you got to connect it together what new birth brings you into the body of christ okay that's where brother ryan said the pentecostals failed he said they've taught the new birth that brought you into the body but they didn't go on with the adoption so thereby they cut themselves short and then let me state the prophet he said you better leave them baptist alone because they'll tire you up with the word now what's he talking about the baptist knew the letter of the word they knew the adoptions and the things that we were required to have they knew even how those things came into being what it took to bring that they knew those things all right so you don't see anybody preaching redemption of the body nowhere even in the message they're not preaching oh they're preaching yeah one of these days is going to be 20 days one eight days if the virtues are required why not let's do one thing let's see if we can bring them virtues into being because if that's what's supposed to be that's what's supposed to be if tribulation worketh patience then let's lay on the tribulation might bring some patience to us okay and now listen so do you understand now i'm trying to lay this to point because i ain't going to be able to get where i want to go and i know that but i'm laying it up to a point for you to understand i'm laying it and telling you exactly what i'm preaching you ever noticed if you'll listen to this advice one time tom falboys had a good idea he said you come in the morning he said you hear what you need to hear he said but you come back in the evening you'll get understanding of what you're supposed to be getting he said but if you don't come back in the evening you ain't going to get it well whose fault is it so i'm telling you i'm laying out exactly what i mean by this because there's three stages to adoption new birth authorities redemption of the body write in the word of god then you'll see why brother brown spent all those years preaching those things to try to get us to come to that place see there's no excuse to say we don't understand well israel picked up that natural thing and applied it it became a natural part of their environment times or whatever you want to call it but see when you start teaching it then you see that the natural israel never reached the redemption of the body so they got two stages in top we got to have all three amen all three has got to come into manifestation to a change of these bodies that we're living in there's your adoption in the finality but listen no bodily redemption to put forth in the old testament you had tops of it shadows of it speaking of it it happened in a natural they did people with people was raised from the dead and all that but it never brought a total reality job was the closest one because he said i know my redeemer liveth and in the last days i'll stand on this earth and he said i'll receive that new body that i'm supposed to get not another body that body redeemed bodily redemption people of the message want to preach a new why didn't were you worried about new you just got a car in wearing out situations to say you got a new car it's going to wear out okay but now listen but paul he says to the galatians he said you're going to get tutors and governors this is what you need you need school masters you need teachers now can i quote the prophet did he say it this way he said pastors evangelists and things has her job what did he say about the teacher he said he's the one that sets you in order to set you in order because he's to teach you are you listening peter you never said anything else after you taught the stature of a perfect man to talk about love being the headstone you never mentioned it coming to the redemption i mean the full adoptional redemptions he said well i really didn't know i needed it but see paul was the only man that could take it all away naturally when peter and them john and all them picked it up yes sir they picked up what he said went and taught it and it was great the romans was a great church but listen no bodily redemption from the old testament in the form of one thing you had to get jesus christ here all right you agree you had to get jesus christ here to be able to die for us to bring forth the sign all right do you agree on this you got to get jesus christ inside of you in the new birth before you can even start talking about being a child of god well brother dale i believe the message amen so does the devil sorry and he trembled about believing it right is that the bible the devil believed in god and trembled he was scared that's what your bible says what we know in head knowledge is wonderful i wish i've always said i wish i had within the revelation of my soul being that i am all that was in my head as head knowledge i do but i admit it's not there in that situation but don't let me turn it down let me keep studying it until it comes to pass church listen i was preaching this in 1960s what was you doing 69 started teaching and and talking about adoption that's not bragging i see stealing the fact i don't have to brag people that have been around me know it's true because they you get on the internet and just say did anybody ever hear anybody about them did they go you're gonna get it back they're gonna say i don't agree with him on what he's doing or what he's saying i couldn't understand what he was talking about i don't agree with it but said that one thing about it he tried all right but she's trying to get it in order stage one is your new birth you've got to have the new birth because that was the adoptional form back there the adoptional form back in the old testament of the romans started with the basis that a child was born into their family he had every right of the family but yet he had to be tutored and trained to be brought to the position to where he could be trusted and he could do and and work everything would be right right and see back there then you didn't have talking about authorities of things like we do but he did have an authority of a a child that was brought into the body i mean brought into the family as a tutored child that knew how to run and raise the corn the crops and the doings and how to take care of everything he knew all about it he knew what his father's ideas was but he never reached the change of the body paul says we're under governors and tutors and things like that but we still ain't reached it he said there's something here that i don't hold i don't understand so he picked it up a little higher somebody run that clock back we could be all right see paul took what he saw he didn't deny what he saw well i ain't gonna study nothing no romans i ain't listening no catholic church oh then evidently you don't like the statement right around and made where he said the catholic was the original pentecost right the catholics was the first pentecostals and they wasn't pentecostal your prophet said they were and he said if they'd remind that look what it would have been but see we want to throw off on that we just said oh we don't want to do with them romans and then then baptist them methodists and and all like that we don't you know why because you don't know a lot of them talk things that this church needs over and over to understand you're growing in grace and knowledge peter picked it up really he got on over into starting to bring his message and he said newborn babes desiring the sincere milk of the word then you begin to bring brain to your faith virtual knowledge to infrastructures god he was bringing it to a point of what would be called stage two let's just go ahead i'll cut it right on the point so get to uh romans where am i at i'm missing my own notes okay page one if i looked on the front page let's just read romans you got it bring it up romans 8 verse 15. i'll try to read as fast as i can and do what i can to get to a point all right start in verse 14 because yeah i left m14 but watch now for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god there's your new birth there's your born-again experience there's that baby in christ there's that desire and ascendancy of milk there's those things all right lord for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear we we've got away from all that but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by father what is the first stage of adoption the spirit of adoption you can't make it this over here and that over there or something it's the spirit of adoption that's what paul is explaining to the romans you you took this from those people back there you brought in what they brought in you've you've accepted the son as a child born into the family and you've put the tutors and trainers and school masters and and guardians over them to teach them and bring them into a position of manifestation to where they can be a christian god wants his children to be christian amen oh yeah i was looking one day on the wall or the house and we had the pictures up years ago down kind of wall you know like that and it run down there and wade and i was tearing was anna and you know we had their little different stages in life you know four five years old at nine years old just had them on the wall and you could stand and look at them and i'd say you know what i'd like to see terrance stayed right there because i wouldn't have had the problems that i had with him had he stayed right there because i remember that huh right because they were my children but you know what the talk came said yeah but if he stayed there he wouldn't grow up he wouldn't become what you want him to be i set out right then to do one thing to try to teach my children the ways of god through the stature of a perfect man not necessarily me having it but me be able to preach it to where they could receive it that's my goal whether or not i get it to get there or whatever don't make no difference with me my goal is to see you there i have to get started if i don't want but what do you receive you receive the spirit of adoption the spirit of adoption is your new birth the spirit of adoption is your new birth you're adopted into the family a child that's born into the family is then coming forth then to be adopted into the parts of virtues and and authorities all right so take the first one and put it as a spirit of adoption and put that identification i got these written in my bible on mar i mean on romans i got stage one identification stage two authority stage three change the body i've had them in there ever since i've come in this message listen you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear you don't have no set of rules or just that or the other to try to act like a child you're just born there because you receive the spirit of adoption stage one the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit what spirit the holy spirit the holy spirit is the new birth holy spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god you get to virtue somebody's going to see it all right come on and if children then heirs heirs of god and join ours with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together what is it heirs what about being joint heirs what about being joint heirs with jesus you know if you've got joiners you're supposed to have everybody supposed to have the same right i mean if his joint is joined it's supposed to be the same both of you got the same thing same amount same doing okay so what's the second stage you're moving away from from just being a child going towards something else down here now watch it for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us watch now for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god what is manifest to make known second stage of adoption is what to make known authority where that jesus over there was standing on river jordan and the holy spirit come down and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell now don't put here you him there wait until you get over to matthew 17 if we get the time to get there if you don't put matthew 13 as river jordan matthew 17 is jesus on the mount of transfiguration all right because he comes to full authority over there okay watch now for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in other words we were put down under all of this thing but we're waiting on the manifestation of the sons of god because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god even nature itself is groaning waiting for the children of god to come to their place that bull that the prophet said if i'd have had my gun he was a natural man right he said i would have shot and went and paid for it but he didn't have the gun but he had more than the gun he said bull go lay down that old bull just walked over and laid down he had authority he had manifestation see paul knew peter and him had authority and manifestation he knew those that was there with him had those things he knew it he honored peter he didn't throw off on him about the statue of a perfect man he said you're trying to get that to there you're doing the greatest thing that could be done peter because i have tried to get this virtues into the people and can't get it it's just something they're not taking my teaching but said you are taking the minute the message back and bringing it into the statue of a perfect man because that's what peter was doing paul didn't take all of the authorities all of everything but what did it be for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaileth and pained together until now now watch but our not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit which have the first fruits fourteen's verse up our first fruits which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown authority waiting within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body to which means to understand i know what it means witnessing et cetera et cetera all right fine to use them but i like it where it says to wit the redemption of our body to understand you realize this message come to bring us the understanding of the adoption paul had the message he took what the natural romans could do and adopted their children and brought them in that and then taught them intuited them brought them into authority but as far as they could go then you started your new testament now i'm drawing five so following you started your new testament you had people there that was like peter in them that could stand there and say silver and gold have i none but in the name of jesus christ they could talk about the new birth because they had the new birth peter says you know growing in grace and knowledge desiring the sincere milk of the word that you may grow by thereby he was teaching those things to the people and as he was doing that god wasn't through because god knew there was something missing so he says paul go down to the romans because they got this thing started and maybe by going to some of them that gets borne again they'll be able to understand what i'm fixing to tell you because i'm going to tell you how the body is redeemed come on do you understand three stages to adoption not two see you hear the people of this message talk about these things but listen to what are they talking about do they take it all the way to the change of the body or do they just stop at them because here's what most people had and i was listening was the other day brother brown says you talk about manifested sons of god he said you say we we need them in the millennium now listen i'll give it to you it's almost verbatim he said you say that we're talking about the manifested sons of god in the millennium he said we don't need them in the millennium he said we need them right now we need them right now we need manifested sons and daughters of god right now you ain't going to need it in the millennium there ain't going to be no prayer lines or sickness or or something wrong legs missing or arms missing something in the millennium you won't even have that in the group that can come up in bankruptcy after the millennium what do you understand paul was trying to explain the thing that job said i can see it and i know it ever thought about what he was saying when he said i know i know my redeemer liveth come on musicians i know my redeemer liveth but he said but in the last days come on joe said that right but all at once something struck him and when it struck him he said i know my redeemer liveth now a millennial reign manifested son and daughter of god are all right but i uh we need them now i cry every night and pray and think about all of these that are sick and i go through the list of everybody and i said lord think about it i said lord you promised it these things wouldn't come upon us and i don't believe they have i don't believe the the tribulation that is spoke of there in the bible and all i don't believe it's poured out yet that's the wrath of god poured out we're still under the grace of almighty god we're still under praying for the sick and things like that but one of these days when it comes under that basis and god's wrath is poured out there's no need for you to pray it won't be nothing to pray the bible said they cry for the rocks and things to fall on and hide them from the eyes of him but now if we can't keep up with the footman the bible said if you can't keep up with the foot what about when the horsemen get here in other words you can't keep up with the footman what are you going to do when the horses come out and start running that's the stature of a perfect man that's the things we need to study as to how to get these virtues and things and to come into manifestation and it is not all head knowledge because head knowledge will not bring you nothing [Music] but an uplifted person that thinks they know something there ain't nobody in this building no different than anybody else i don't care who you are and where you come from we're all one in the body of christ you've heard me tell the story of the dream that i had when all these white people was following me walking through white sand looked over to the side and there come a dark cloud and not not just say now and plain in language put it not black negro african black i'm talking about dark colored race of people which could be anything from any parts of the world the chinese are dark-colored this the dark color they all that the the foreign countries are a lot of it so you see i'm not talking about that but a group of people came in and when they did i just stopped and they looked and the man stood out and said now you've got to teach us turn around and look if you counted the darkness of any race of anything you wanted to count whether it be chinese or whether it be japanese or whether it be vietnamese or koreans or anything you turn it just turn around and look you'll see this is probably more dark colored people than they are white we had that reputation when we was first started the brothers used to love to come here brother brady in jamaica his first time he had been to america with everything but it was up there jeff i got acquainted with him and and uh we was up there and i was at ruth but up at ruth and and he looked at me and he was planning on i was planning on him coming down that that was friday or saturday he was to preach here on sunday then he said brother dale said where's my people he said where's my people where's the dark-colored races of people i said you'll see it in the morning for the services you see people here from all over the country all over the world let's stand for go ahead ready i'm sorry let's see how i love jesus i noticed wade had something on adoption in there so he'll get on it this evening [Music] [Music] a message [Music] what a wonderful he knows [Music] is [Music] then you gotta love me you know what you got to love me if you love him [Music] amen you're just me if you pray one for another remember wade this afternoon remember the wednesday night service and all the announcements father we thank you for your love and your grace to each one of us and we pray that you just help us and guide us in jesus name how i love jesus
