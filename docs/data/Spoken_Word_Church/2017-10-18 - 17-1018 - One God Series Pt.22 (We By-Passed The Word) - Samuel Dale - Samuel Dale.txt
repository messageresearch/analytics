just have your way and the Lord just lead us into that understanding as to what to say and how to minister your word we love you and we thank you forgive our sins and keep us covered by the blood we thank you for all the things in Jesus name Amen John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God brother branham you remember in the unveiling I'm God he said in the beginning was the logos to localise with whistles the low cost and low cost was the low cost you know it was God he's the work so it's the same being right the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and we like shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not he couldn't understand it no way then could it put it out right now let's go over to John 20 and we'll try to pick up earth out here 20 20 20 and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then where did the south was glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so send I you and how does the father send you he goes in you right that's what he's saying I'm gonna send you out and you're going to come forth and bring the word and when he had done when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive you the Holy Ghost who soever sins you admit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word alright now we've been covering for quite a while the three part thought that I was wanting you to be able to follow with us in our delivery of the message in trying to you know get us to the right place in talking about how that God came forth into manifestation I don't like to use the word come into being there because he always was into being it was not a we get our thoughts and our words and heard things like that because he always was but he become to condescend downward to be able to us to be you know to be able to comprehend him that was the reason he done the way he done all right then he came from that existence of self existing and he started condescending he started revealing himself is he making himself known and as he did he come in to word form and in that word form he then could create so then he would start his part of creation in life alright so then he came straight into the word and then from that word he became flesh in Melchizedek remember and then came forth into full manifestation into the Lord Jesus Christ alright then that's why that we can read the scriptures of John 1 Hebrews 1 Colossians 1 Ephesians 3 and 9 and all and say all things are created by Jesus Christ because that way we believe Jesus Christ is Almighty God the flesh was a flesh that was named Jesus but that was not the the point that this to his name his name was Jesus Christ which means Almighty God in human flesh alright as I've always said to you about it then we see him in Matthew 13 or 16 where he says who demands stay out of son of man he said then when Peter fish he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God do you realize if he was the son of the Living God what did the prophets say the first thing that come out from God was God in another form called the word all the sun seas in our mind black holes you know and goes haywire when we think of a Sun but just remember you are his children you're his offspring your sons and daughters of God so why would it be hard to think about what he was he was the fullness of it that's the point I've been driving at sea in him dwelt the fullness all right in him in that word form that he came out to where he could come to create an event was the fullness of Almighty God all right is that hard to follow he was a fullness he was all of God all right we see you and I can not be all of God in one person we have to be part of God all right see then you put all the parts together and then you got it in the correct order and I love the Prophet in this statement of saying that the four that the Godhead can't be complete without you all right then what did we talk about Adam Adam being the one twenty six and twenty seven man to come into being in the image of God was a part of God right because Adam came forth in that point of the 1:26 and 27 man and that would put him to be there as to be Almighty God but the part that he was to be now not the fullness of God Adam wasn't all he wasn't the fully buddy he was his part all right the 1:26 man is a multiple form man because it's Almighty God we'll get to those things later as we try to deal with it all right but Sunday we were covering about that Adam was God's example son all right that was what God wanted was for you and I to come in that way you know to be the way that Adam was and Adam was what now first in creation as we talked about of the 1:26 twenty-seven man in the image of God he was ruler of the earth right but just remember when he stepped over in human flesh he became God of the earth did you catch that from Sunday in other words when he stepped over when he was put that one 26 was put into human flesh he became the god of the earth God is the God of heaven but he became that was his domain it turned into a fleshly park when the 126th man was put into the two-seven man God breathing into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul that made him on earth as God of the earth okay the earth was his domain now follow that point as we keep going with it all right see then Adam being in that form but yet just being part of God not being all of God when he was put into human flesh he did he was not made to fall but by giving him free more agency he did fall all right now remember how we was doing it brother Brennan says from blasphemous names all right we went over these Sunday blasphemous names he's explaining the Jehovah Witness doctrine of how they believe that to our you breathe is the soul I know he said that's not right okay so then when he comes on down a little further watch what he said all right Jordan don't know but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life now can you believe that I asked you a simple question do you believe the Prophet is right in saying that mm-hm now I'd ask you because point is if you didn't believe it I was gonna say there's something wrong with you because you couldn't believe acts 2:38 you know you couldn't believe Matthew 28:19 you couldn't believe anything else if you can't believe that the atom C was the way God was intended for you and how to come we would have come into existence and God would have breathed into our nostrils and would have become eternal in soul then we went to the Tree of Life and been made eternal in body that's a simple terminology simple thought but can we believe that God breathed into Adam eternal life and we'll get back to it in a minute because I want to rekey up the cap this to keep it in your mind when the Prophet would say in that blast theme is nice he said then you say Adam died now how could Adam die with eternal life the way we think the way we think if he died without eternal life I mean if you had eternal life and you die that mean you take it away from you now where's God and then didn't get over to be able to do anything no all right so then the prophets telling us exactly what happened he breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became an eternal soul now that means his soul was put into human flesh and he saw was this theophany so he came theophany form in the basis of soul stepped in to eat a human flesh God breathed into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul uh-huh he turned a life put into the soul of Adam like I said that was his example child he wanted all of his children to be that way but then he had attributes he had all these other things I was thinking about that last night you think about how would you we were listening to the tape you think about let's see if I can get that thought you you think about that Adam God would make Adam eternal in his soul and even if his body was just stayed to be a forever condition or whatever you know you wouldn't have to put it into but you want to put it into eternity and whatever it don't mind well what if it stayed that way little brother said that the tree of life was in the garden to remind Adam that his youth was being renewed so I could have just stayed it away then we would come into being the way Adam come into being why would God have other thoughts then to have brought us that way I see you thinking you say well it's because he had other attributes that's wonderful and we know that did he want her to display but what could be greater what could be greater then all of mankind to be eternal in soul in the garden with his youth being renewed not getting older not getting any problems no devil no troubles what would be greater than that come on only be greater well he had attribute okay see now you're just making an answer you're not considering the thought you're just trying to answer by your amount of wording that you've heard before it amazes me to a kid you can walk up to a kid and you can say to a child do you want an ice cream and they say yes I want an ice cream they can't spell the word they couldn't read if he was rolled out in front of them but they know how to tell you and ice cream and you know what they know what an ice cream is right they know the difference in hi screaming and I thought why it's vocabulary implanted within them over time to recognize words Anna yeah you can see SOT what is this that words you got sight words see when I look down here I don't have to say bu T WH 81 G ot gone di D but now if I hand it to you a piece of paper written in Chinese would you be able to read it now some of you might and you don't get the point ninety-nine point percent and here wouldn't be every Chinese right well you know what's at words I don't mean a thing does it he said when he told me I'm trying to get you to think about what would be greater to God than to bring all of his offspring into being and let him stand on the earth as God of the earth the animals would be under their control there would be no death no sorrow there would be nothing now remember according to Christ the mission of God revealed that God had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve right now what is come on I weep over these trying to get that out what would be greater than to think about all of the children in the garden and everything perfect no death no sorrow no nothing nor whatever and God has a greater plan what is the greater plan what he had attribute okay an attribute no let me just shorten it and give you the thought this is the human way I think what would be greater than to God have all of his children what would be greater for you if you had all of your children and you just had them in a perfect atmosphere and a perfect deal anything you said that I want I've got a longing for something else I got a longing for my attributes to be displayed and look what a horrible situation life has been placed in what could be greater than his children and everything perfect because if he created us perfect he gave us everything to do we would not love him the way that we should love him for allowing us to come this way gonna go home do you understand we can talk about it he created us for fellowship that's wonderful because fellowship involved in sonship to a position higher than to just everybody being perfect and happy in everything do you love him thattaway you asked 7 8 9 10 year old kids that you love God and he just puts you through all these trouble knees oh no well you ask most adults that and they say no or I don't understand or I don't you know do you realize that sin not entered the picture we would not know our God only as a father only has a creator or you know he said well sure any fun to be sick no but you know what I think about about God in his ways and this is gonna be crazy I know and the Bible speaks of a woman in childbearing and it says that in her pain I'm paraphrasing her agony and things but says they joy that a child is born and none of your sisters while you were having the child unless you were knocked out in them you know and you still hurt like crazy and you down problems and you hurt and for then you didn't go through the house you know and and go glory I'm gonna have a baby I'm gonna have a baby I'm having a bad guy feel so good I'm hurt all over gonna have a baby no no he was human you were hurting you were crying you were in agony what takes away the pain and the heartaches Joyce yeah I didn't know I was going this way in the joy Joyce decided she was gonna have her children without you know shot sometimes or did you call him you know never do roles whatever those words are and she was going to go and she went through this long thing and Danny goes with her and they go and gotta know waiting them done it and then done Richard huh you know and they go and and they go through that training and training and all they telling the husband is that you just stand there say come on breathe come on Bri come on Bri come on Bri come on Bri come on Bri did they tell you what you were training the net did you get down and hold you off the holder honey I love you you're the sweetest thing they didn't tell you that did he only told you tell her to breathe right I mean that filing I was just okay Danny keeps saying breathe John you know what George does here I can see that you're I wouldn't know everything the shut up get out of here I breathe on my own she wasn't too happy but when that little Jacob oh come on and that little baby and you hold it pain starts going away Joss is not telling Danny I told you back out of the leaf she send any look that's sweet oh it's wonderful look at the little one you understand I know I'm crazy the way I think about things but see if if you're not having to I know you're gonna maybe differ with my approach when I'm just sorry I said something there the other day and maybe you don't even think about it I said it about Gail and I said just together I said just think somebody one of these days up in glory would be talking and they look at you and I say if you hadn't come I wouldn't be here because we hadn't fallen they would have not been any foolish virgins and people like that or anything I wouldn't kidding the people will say if you hadn't have fallen well you're sounding like you're making the fall some glory some something I've tried to explain what I'm making the having the baby is not the thing it's when the baby gets here right so is everybody with me it's not that part it's not joyous that God was looking back and soon one of my kids are gonna fall and when they fall I'm gonna do what the rest my stuff no he knew everything he knew everybody would be here Adam was his example child but then Adam fell but did he fall to death yes because the Prophet said he did but he said for he died did he had a lamb I emphasized if you remember Sunday that Adam lived 930 years you know so it wasn't the fact that Adam and Eve done wrong abloom Adam fell over no cuz we don't consider what the truth of all of it is I don't never died and went to hell you can't give Adam eternal life and take it away God not an Indian giver to do those things brother Branham and blasphemous names he said Adam died but he couldn't leave him and you know he couldn't just let him fall over and die and he certainly couldn't put him in hell Adam fell from the Prophet said eternal life well you're just trying to interpret what he's saying I'd love to hear you tell me some other way come on you tell me some other way to keep this thing straight to work you can't have him died and going to hell if he had eternal life there's no way you could put eternal life in hell so he never died that way he physically died that 126 man I kept emphasizing the Sunday the 126 man he can't do wrong he's in God's image God likeness you can't see him that way so the sin could not have come into existence while Adam and Eve were in that theophany situation of eternal life they had to be put into human flesh for something to take place so just remember then Adam never he died physically and when he died physically he put every one of us into death you remember us reading it is it enough that the Prophet would say okay the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the eternal God and he became a living soul he was a son of God that was Adams that was God's plan for all of us but couldn't go back to in a second do you understand let's see can I say something like this just a Gail sister Gail told me a story that happened one time and I had me I had a little bit just fun but since the Gail was a spoiled brat she okay yes she was she was talking about it yesterday or no no she was talking about they had everything they didn't worry about it they could just go down to the grocery store and this say gimme and they didn't daddy paid it later that she's bought okay all right but she was complaining to her mother about something that she didn't have shoes okay her mother just took her in the other room and there was her daddy sitting with his feet up on the Ottoman I guess that what you call those things or situation she just pointed because her daddy would give her anything in the world but there he said with a hole in the bottom of his shoe he could see the socks the hole that took care of the new part shoes you know why because she's seen daddy loved her I'm trying to get you to think about why God would allow this thing to continue beyond the fact of just bringing us here as a family or just bringing us here as people and letting us be for rats and just live in the garden and big rule of everything never have to worry about nothing with something greater than that would be in the mind of God didn't in his mind he could see his children he could look down and see his children and he said even though I put him through all of this trouble I put him through all these heartaches and trials my children will come out of this loving me that's what he wants that's what he wanted was his family to love him you look at your children and you see them do wrong you said what I said it's not like my child but then you get to thinking about hey you know what I remember when I was about that age and when I done it didn't begins to change don't it all right get the story Adam was God's plan and purpose the God wanted his other attributes to be brought in to be displayed and he wanted his children to love him do you love him cuz you're not going to hell do you love him because he has given you everything because remember those attributes that he wanted displayed one of those attributes was to be a father but one of them was to be a son that could pay the price one of them was to be the holy ghost come on I'm quoting brother branham order if you wanted I'll be glad to give him tea he said he had an attribute of being son he had an attribute of being God he had an attribute of all of these things see we just say attribute God the God is a word about God's word you know ever how you say word because it could mean anything and that's true but remember the word God is also the greatest word that could be brought in the English language because he's my god but follow the point all of those other attributes would have never come into being and we would have never loved him as we do how much did brother Branham love God he said and I remember this one the first time he was saying it he said if when it comes to the end of the road and said I have to die and go to hell I'm paraphrasing it's close he said I can go by and say father thank you I love you can you say you love him for allowing you to go through the pain the agony Zand trials and heartaches and troubles or do you love him because your dear poor brat and he's took care of y'all let's see when is it abraham dreaming the other day when he said I know Abraham will teach his children right he said I know Abraham will teach his children what to love him for what he is know what it could be I notice not using job is Jonah Oh God God you know it and I know it you wouldn't go and destroy them people you know like that if I could have got you to dealt on five more you wouldn't have destroyed nothing that part then there it had to stop he said I know that you do you're not gonna Jonah he said you're not getting all the stories tied together to get it right listen so if Adam was God's example child that's what he wants for all over and brother branham it's in here we read we read around and said one day the sons of God will come back to that same place that Adam existed cause see now what I'm saying most of our thinking most of you are thinking was the fact that Genesis 1:26 and 27 was the spirit man that would rule the garden did you ever consider that that spirit man was put into Adam and Adam rule the garden Adam the human flesh man Adam that's why the Bible calls us we are the god of this earth we are his people what about it the brother Brown gets into the seal book and he says but Adam died City he fell from eternal life well how can you fall from eternal life that's what I don't understand I'm honest I'm sorry to put this out because it'll throw the devil in that line you'll start using it I don't understand the people who dismiss these preachers in this mess ain't got enough sense to preach if I was gonna preach against bread around them I'd preach on that right time I'd give you all of the things we're brother Brennan said Adam died and then said come on now you tell me if Adam died he went to hell and if he fell from eternal life you definitely put him in hell where else could you put him what are you following me Adam physically died to fulfill the Word of God that the other attributes could start coming into being right and that attribute would first start off as being that God made an atonement he took the skins off of them animals and give them to Adam and Eve to live and cover them think about it Adam never died and went to hell you can't do that there's there's no such thing as having eternal life and then being able to lose it now we'll get to in the message of the new birth we'll get to the point that you can make a confession but a confession is different than a possession a confession of eternal life is not eternal life a possession of eternal life is eternal life all right we'll get down to those thing but you see what I'm talking about brother Branham said he said you come like Adam like me and he said Adam and the way it came it's and who is this well said it was reading Adam came the correct way that was the 126 man that eternal life the creation of man and then put him into flash that's the correct way that was the way God wanted it what you see we didn't come that away now you hear what brother Branham used and that's the title of the message did not we bypass the word Adam came the word remember he was the god of the earth he was ruler oh you think he didn't have a pretty good vocabulary he named all the animals okay that sounded like it you must have been pretty smart let's see you and I didn't come down away little random use it two or three times and who is this male charity and he says we bypassed the word Jesus came word to flesh Adam came word to flesh the part that Adam was to be he came the part of God he was to be word that part and then he became flesh which you see we bypassed coming the word to stand our and a word body I'm quoting if you want to put them up we'll read it we bypass that word falling body the theophany and we came to flesh to be tempted he said we bypassed this is one coma we bypass coming the way God did now listener bypass is not 285 run around Atlanta I always say that you know cuz you don't get like old Perez woods you don't run get lost you keep going around and around and around and around by Pais doesn't mean what we put it down as a point what about patch means it's dark but we go around dig well why did we go around it I mean if it was the higher why didn't we go that away see then what we done we by Pais coming the way God came word and in the flesh we bypass coming the way Adam came word one 26 or 27 flesh we came straight to flesh right to be tempted of sin we're back up in the message cuz we're gonna get Adam and what really the fall was in the garden but the point I want you to cover with me brother Brennan said it was the word we we didn't come word he said we bypass coming to word he said we become the word here you remember that we become the word here and how do you become the word Easter seed you become the word as you receive the word what is the new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you what the revelation of the word of God personally to you so we didn't come like God came from word to flesh we didn't come like a Adam from word of the party was I keep saying that part where you won't get tied up in the wrong time the party was to be he became that put in flesh extending her perfect right but then he fell and when he did right around and said to steelbook he said that put us all on the other side of the chasm Adam's sin put us all on the other side of the chasm he said bring us to death bring us to the place that don't try to talk about having an eternal Center I know I get arrogant and sarcastic so a lot of times in the statements I make about the ministers and the way they go but I'm sorry if God forgive me you forgive me just put that all behind but people say but I come with eternal life I've got quotes from the Prophet did I come with eternal life I got folks in the Prophet it did Adam fell for me what are we gonna do fight quotes are you good that's what it's been for all these years is to fight in the quotes - so let me sold that so that so what was this what was that what was its no what was that what was that how many nights how many what just keep running but listen Church do you believe I'm gonna try to cut this part down because do you fell from the position or bypass the position of coming you by Pais coming the way God came you by Pais coming and I'm say we well we bypass the word but we become the word here and how do you become the word you become the word as you receive the word now here's one to listen to brother branham emphatically States two or three times that you bypass your theophany sin who dis melchester come straight to flesh and by Pais that word cuz that's what he's calling the word a theophany here's one I love who's this Melchizedek paragraph 88 then after you could recognize the very word of God with eCos food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany when did you hear if you earth evening though unless after we get into messy night with that goes with double form because it will cover it here into this and has to be covered but when you receive the new birth that was the birth of the word and by receiving the new birth you heard from your theophany you know why because you was a sinner before then lost but then one day you received eternal life not Church receiving eternal life what about it what about receiving eternal life but around says on the message that token the word is the promise and the word is God and the word is ours and we become the word and the word becomes us what a great statement what about it by the fall of Adam brother Brendan tells us over and over we can't blame Adam we're on a free moral agency deal and we don't blame Adam right it's not their fault it's our fault right so let's get a way of thinking well it wouldn't if they had done we wouldn't of done earlier you ain't getting the story and you surely ain't listening to what I spent half an hour while ago trying to get you to realize that the fact that to follow brought into being things from God that you and I would have never known an existence of parenthood that would have never been understood in existence and the thoughts of loving God because of what he has done for us would have never come into being I did not Ben I preached a message one time I remember years ago and some people they liked at it but it was called a blessing of a blemish somewhere you may remember blessings of a blemish you realize the blemish kept a lot of lambs would be killed there's a blessing visible image well you know what that's coming into existence like we did as I said had brought out a lot of the attributes of God and he's going to look down at us and say I don't see your blemishes he says come unto me o ye that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest you don't deserve it nothing else but I'll give it to you you went into the world and because of your sin and your doing I was able to display and look at all of these other people that are here in the world that one day I'm going to give a lot of them eternal life not glorying in the fall but fall hadn't to come they wouldn't be here so the blessings are there alright now I'm going to cover something that I'll have to cover in a two-part as to one day when it will be covered in the statue of a perfect man so remember that as I'm saying it we will to cover it in first into this part tonight what about that new birth but it's a wonderful thing to think about the new birth as being the birth of the word the words you heard I believe then did you come with a seed in you now not like it's taught in the message I'm talking about a seed which is the world because I believe every born-again believer was a part of the Word of God before the foundation of the world and they succeed for every age to be made manifest right it's not sieved like these others they got to put a little spot here put a little spot there I put little dots here oh look at those little dots I just see myself I'm running little dots I don't want to be a dog I want to be a child of God I want to love my father because of the way he's done me then you'll understand why I make that statement that you think I'm stupid crazy idiot everything in the world when I say I wouldn't change my name for all the money in the world because my name is me well I could change my name still be me you sold your birthright you're a nice aw give me a morsel of food come on brother Dale can preach sometimes you'd want to be like Esau with a morsel of food something to eat to keep you from dying good morning God to come into this heart so much until it'll take every fiber of my being and take me in the rapture what does it mean to be born again Adam was God's original plan you agree with that you agree cause a prophet you know you need to find him he's that was God's way that he wanted to bring it and how did he bring him in a marvelous way he created a body no Jesus 2:7 and he just simply breathed into the nostrils of that man Adam eternal life right what did he do he put two 1:26 9:27 into two seven is that the way the prophets did it happen Adam didn't have eternal life in his body he didn't have eternal life in his spirit he only had eternal life in his soul because that was the way God meant for it to be what about you what is the new birth well this is a new birth brother branham Christ the mystery of God reveal relation of Jesus Christ personal to you and he said that's what the church is built on is the revelation of Jesus Christ that is the new birth how did you get the new birth and how did you get the new birth but I just went to church one day ayah I thought what I didn't go challenge maybe you like I would 18 years old and I said well my wife won't go women nowheres else we'll have to go to church and she wouldn't so we went to church hey boys and girls were I don't know what is like him and there was no way was I sitting there enjoying what that preacher had to say I wanted him to shut up I won't even team to say let's stand right I'm a human you'd be goody-goody oh you won't - and sweetie sweetie but you just lied so forget it I went to church what did you do I met guard 1011 years old so then there's no organ right where there was a garden hike ain't no problem I don't care but you see I was wanting to find that God I won't find that garden now you won't believe this but I won't find that guard as much as I was that girl sitting beside him because he was on my mind as much the time as she was except you know what I mean boys and girls and he loved you okay human beings all right what you see I would think about that I would think about God and I'd wonder and one day I've heard it taught and read enough to note it said that I had to accept him as my savior you ever done that there was what was taught you accept him as your Savior you believe in your heart confess with your mouth and you're saved no I'm not throwing off on nobody Church because that's what God was he he dwelt with the people during all those times of the way they told it don't think I'm throwing off on God all he was waiting on somebody who could come and tell us the truth and who was our waiting on I was waiting on somebody could tell me about a God that I knew was real that I knew existed that he was real and I begin to read what this man said he began to talk about in God as being real he began to tell about how real he was how he condescended to mankind and how and I thought here's a man talking about the God that I've been looking for but you see I wasn't like everybody else I didn't count my new birth as the day I saw God I didn't count I didn't count the new birth is the three times that's all man in my house there's an angel I didn't count that is my new birth I heard a man talking about a birth and he said a lot of us Baptist believes and we got it Lord of us method this shout it and we got it a lot of us Pentecostal spoke in tongues and God he said but a lot of them didn't get it why when my Bible said if I believe and I'll say it he's got to save me it's his problem is that the way the world types of salvation is his problem to do then we come up to the prophet and we hear him say he said you accepted Jesus Christ but said did he accept you did except you that's why that I was two years in this message before I would and I was prayed far by every preacher and I could get I was counseled by everybody could be thought of you know talking because I'd ask questions talk to people brother mote one day he said Sam he said I don't know what's your hunting I said you ain't the only one that don't know what I'm up I said code I don't know what I'm not he's talking about signs evidences doing verse or whatever I knew we could fellowship he said was only one thing I want to tell you he said I've always tried to teach you and the church that God is a person I see yes sir oh the days and wonders of him standing here reading over and over and if brother mote said God is is God he read it right and we rode the country and and I learned the book so much too he could call out greatest battle ever fought and I would pull out the color of the book and hand it to him he I didn't have to search I knew it took my heart I was still hunting and remote I don't know either I said I know the fact that we're shouting speaking in tongues and all of these things I said you know my background of what we've talked he said but God is a person yes sir and he said the birth is the birth of the word that you hear said yes sir he said then quit trying to seek any sign of wonder or whatever and he said you just nail yourself down to that word and stay there probably another year or so Pais we were down in Athens no hollyhocks and brother moat was up preaching I don't know member who was well but it was kind of comical coach nanny come up will be prayed for and I came up to be prayed for and and the Holy Spirit hit both of us and I fell one way and she fell the other way and she fell slap under this drunk and they was a ladies was grabbing her dress and putting everything in fixing and the old drunk its he's trying to figure out what was going on but you see I rose that day knowing one time the new birth is the birth of the word the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and you see if your experience won't start your birth and end in a rapture your experience is not right you're looking for signs and wonders or this or that or the other you looking for something that's not dark look to the word and see the word go now remember one time Adams started as a full-grown man right you agree he wouldn't obey being groped early as full-grown men when God starts things he starts his full-grown when he started the church on the Deaf Pentecost he didn't start it here he started it right here where it says Holy Spirit down the headstone had been rejected we know the whole mess is the story that's why the Bible speaks then all the prophethood or the faith of the Father he started his church off with a group of people that had heard the word for three years in a high there was no novice in the upper room with a hundred and twenty novices and things downstairs were the three thousand the beginners just heard one message those in the upper room were trained and tutored by the Lord Jesus and so great was his doings until Judas was up there and like Wade was saying Sunday we don't want to agree that what the Prophet says Judas was justified he said Judas was sanctified said what he liked was the baptism of the Holy Ghost he was sitting in the upper room because of what had brought him to the upper room then the devil enters him and he fills out the whole thing right but the church started on the day of Pentecost it's full grown children what is that statement brother Henry Green says God started his church the way he wanted and he wants to what church the way he started it if I miss that it's pretty close so go ahead and now brothers in the room there if you will jump over to number 10 on the notes and we'll get started and finished cause remember Adam was born by the breath of God in a nod at the scripture we read that Jesus gathered with him in the upper room after his resurrection and he was there talking with him and he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost three or four days weeks or whatever later they finally received it brother branham I've got it right here laying before me so don't holler and scream about it brother Branham says on the message questions and answers in 64 dear brother Brannon what is the difference when Jesus breathed owner to shop and said receive the Holy Ghost and when that they had to go to the upper room to tarry it was a promise and when he breathed on him was a promise he gave them could have standing preach a little bit about a hat put he telling what he done without him he promised a promise it's you and I would come that same way like he can okay said receive you the Holy Ghost and when they do it was a promise to them breathed upon them his promise said receive you the Holy Ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to will be fulfill the same thing is when you lay hands upon you when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go on about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled what about Adam starting off we only look at him as he fell he was standing there with the promise are you with Adam standing there with a promise that a church was gonna come the same way that he would come you don't go back to who this Melchizedek we're brought around and said he said when they've done that he said that shows that ever son in the end is going to remember how I emphasized I've read around and said God a male charity meeting male charity was the way ever born-again believers gonna come they meet the word here so let's read drop-back now you've got that one drawback blasphemous names come on back the church is the mystical body of Christ born of the breath of God oh do you get it congregation says amen the Church of God is born of the breath of God God breathed into the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he became a living soul if you know the Pentecostals are the true Pentecostal church is born of the breath of God let me read something to you administering let's see just a minute st. John bring it on up because if he's covering you know what the promise alright let me read you and see whether the church is born into the breath of God or not like Adam was in the beginning Oh like Adam was you realize your new birth is exactly the same way that Adam started out he's going to give you the word you take the word it said about to the side when they took the word and held it and the Holy Ghost come on and their pineco licks a fire set upon each one of them tongues of fire they received the new birth I didn't write the book I just love to read it let us see whether the church is born to the breath of God or not like Adam was in the beginning now let's see if he was then he goes to same day of the week when we read it come on up we read the scripture in John and he shows his disciples and he said he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost Church born of the breath of God that's why when you come in a statue of a perfect man we got to come right back to the same quote but you got to get it here because the statement is down here okay you say oh that's just a dollar that's it okay go ahead do what you want to just don't wait and see when we get it together and watch it when this stature has molded assess a variant condition god breathes breath upon then receive you the Holy Ghost and remember to show you mine Ron the disciples had three years of training before the Holy Ghost came so arguing with the Prophet what does he say receive you the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God watch him you join anything you won't tell but you're born into the Church of the Living God in other words he's saying you ain't going to join no church right he ain't saying go join the churches everything's okay join them churches the Bible says come out of her he ain't telling you he's telling you that you could do it if you want to cuz you ain't gonna won't - you mean right now that you would go home and quit church and start going to the Baptist Church next - you need just go over them and when I have to go to church then you're a son of God you join anything you want to but you're born into the Church of the Living God born by the breath of God God breathed upon them and said receive you the whole ago we receive he we the Holy Ghost oh my there you are he said not come and join put your name on there with your soaks up soup suppers and all that going going in Lord you can join a Methodist Baptist large anything you won't do but you're joining but you've joining a lodge but when you become a child of God you are born by the breath of God we pick that up on adoption when we get back to it but just remember the same Holy Ghost that fell in the upper room and gave 120 the new birth was the same Holy Ghost it breathed on 3000 outside and they received the new birth 120 got it faith of the father's brother Brennan said they had these virtues 120 got that but to 3,000 outside heard some of them one sermon they started off babies just remember what I say it Adam was God's original plan for man the fall didn't though nothing on God it brought about all in the way he wanted and should bring all of his children to loving God for the way he's done for them then start off with Adam as a baby like the stupidity of mankind arguing over which came first the chicken or the egg the Bible said God created but it could created eggs and let me know see you're not willing to listen you're just arguing philosophies remember he started his church and brother branham I wouldn't want it made it he said the church is born like Adam do you realize what happened to you then when that new birth came you took the word and you held on to it and you say Lord this is it thank you this is it Lord you know what he done when he breathed on you he just simply gave life to the brook to the word right you took the word and held it I said disciple then he just breathed on you and made to work life there's a new birth that's why he's still breathing he didn't stop breathing every time you receive a revelation from God's Word you are getting the breath of God breathing to you to quicken that word that you've took inhaled one day the headstone will unite with a body it'll be born by the breath of God but remember what the qualifications is to be Adam started the way he was the part of God that he was to be put into human flesh and made alive full-grown god of the earth brother Brennan said one day the sons of God will return I said bless in who is this mill charity he said they'll return again see because on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came upon those that had been tutored for three and a half years and breathed upon them and said receive you the Holy Ghost he said what do you do promising that's just what he done with Adam when he breathed don't had him he said Adam you're an example he said I promise you Adam this fall ain't gonna be what everybody thinks I'm gonna bring it back the way you came and you and I right here on this earth receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost what as God breathes on us to quicken the word to make it alive now why wouldn't you want to hear the word why do you want to read something else but I'd read in the Bible brother Dale just goes over and over over no I'll just get so bored you let it be quick until you one time and you won't be bored the more you let God quicken that word to you one time you will never be the same I tell you that as an example because when I met God I wasn't ever the same until I found God two years in this message reading everything I could read studying everything listening to a tape to go into work one coming home and I've read six books from one day besides listening to two types now you just immunity you just read away cuz it praise God I'm that way cuz I like it cuz I can put my experience in the scriptures but you have most of people in this message to explain their it's their experience they'll explain it shouting speaking in tongue crying seeing visions seeing angels seeing this seeing that and when I come in this message I know I got the Holy Ghost because I come in this message as the message come in you yet maybe you accepted God but may I quote brother Branham as God accepted you never stop seeking God how many times I explained that to you come on brothers musician how many times I explained it over and over I had to rather face God at the end of the road and me saying God give me giving me everyday help me and lead me and get to the end of the road and him say get out of here I don't want to see you no more I'd rather do that than to not seek God and get to the end of the road and he says you didn't seek me I was there with you constantly I'm made in your services and I proclaimed sister Trudy called the other night you'd been six he just testified of it she called me and nanny was sitting in the room there and all at once I was struck and I said nanny let's pray we prayed for sister Trudy you asked her what happened she called the next day and said when she got off the phone immediately was changed when are we going to begin to believe God can do what we ask you to do do you understand why I'm getting in church born by the breath of God Adam was born by the breath of God the day of Pentecost they were born by the breath of God you and I've got to be born by the breath of God and when this thing is finished and the adoptions and everything that in takes place the headstone were you not with the body and God will again breathe the breath of eternal life into these bodies because that's what are you ain't gonna have to breathe no Holy Ghost into us because you'll have that when you'll breathe into your body and it'll be mighty time porn by the breath of God let's tan what do we got 286 anybody have a need let's start with the chorus and now I keep falling in love with you over and over and over I keep falling in love with him over and over Oh [Music] get sweeter and sweeter as the days go by what about it between have you been born by the wrath of God [Music] first verse and revelations come fall in love with Jesus I gave him all of my heart revelation of Jesus crowd I could love him more then I did write about but now I look back go charging barn lawns and the black handles were saving I love how about it how about one more scripture borne by the breath of God when God breathed on them man ask you what happened when the prophet in the Bible saw the valley of dry bones and it was up to the prophet got them saying I won't do it he said prophet you go breathe on them now was it just the Prophet going out and going it had been probably three or four me and having them scattered all over the country don't you understand what took place prophet tell them who they are fulfilling the valley of dry bones it is real to live did not this prophet breathe the breath of life upon you and honor you don't think of the message like that you don't think of the message of him breathing when you and I the word that's why doesn't matter whether he's here or not he's still breathing every time you turn that type on he's still breathing he's still preaching he's still bringing the word come on over and over over and over again anybody have a name over and over again he did sweeter and sweeter as the days go by between motherboard and I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and singing to him and think about it think about - over and over each man these trial word been revealed there is a shoulder he's never become dull to me I don't understand why people could ever get to a place that this message would become I don't get it it's fresh the Bible become dog doing with love started back reading in Genesis the other day just reading through why I've struck Leviticus [Music] that word is real I did I hope you'll go back to listen to what said too now [Music] because that's one guard he's breathing the breath
