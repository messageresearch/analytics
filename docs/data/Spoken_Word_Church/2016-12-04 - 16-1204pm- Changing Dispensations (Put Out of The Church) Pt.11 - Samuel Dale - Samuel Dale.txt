good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Ephesians 1 and then we'll go to Revelations 3 Ephesians 1 Revelations three and just remember now the Lord willing with Aon to be ministering to us Wednesday and then remember now this coming Sunday we'll only have the one service the morning service fellowshipping together and having a good time in that and remember now to the Sunday School teachers uh just cut you Sunday school a little bit short not a whole lot but just enough to where we can get all of the children to come up and they're going to do some singing you know and all before we have the services so remember that and just be with each one okay pray that the Lord would bless and guide us all together in him and so that's Ephesians 1 and Revelation Street remember the announcements now about the be no service here on Sunday the 25th and there will be no service on the first day of January so you have the those you know into what you're doing okay all right Heavenly Father we thank you for thy love and thy Grace truly Lord you are great and you're the The Great I Am and Lord we truly want one thing and that's to open our eyes to thine understanding that we may walk in the light of your grace everything else will be secondary not meaning a thing to us if we can just see you living among us because that's our desire father you made all of the preparations for us to be able to live now may we try to help to do the best we can to make preparation to see that you live among us we love you and we thank you forgive our sins and guide us and bless each one in Jesus name amen okay we've been in Ephesians 1 verse 8 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence have having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him all right now let's go to the revelations three and that was the hour that we're living in the time so we'll begin with verse 14 Revelation 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of candr these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest why is he going to spew them out now because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Ramen that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i saave that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will shut with him and he with me you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word all right now we try to pick back up where we left off in there talking this morning and believing that you know now I'm I'm asking you this message to listen very carefully because it it's it's going to be a little uh problem because it's like I said how could brother brandham now stand up and flatly rebuke the Pentecost in every message you know the Presbyterian Baptist Methodist and all the rest but didn't we say Pentecostals because that would cover why would he stand up and rebuke them and tell them that they had done this they had done that they lost their first love they had went away from the word of God uh and all like that and said you've turned away from God when in ever service they were having sick healed dead raised not just my brother random now limbs restored the greatest Revival brother brandham said now if you want this I'll be glad to find it the greatest Revival he said that had ever been for mankind was the isusa Street Revival now you know where he comes on up with that he doesn't just put it 1906 and stop he comes up on up in into his ministry in the times 20s and 30s and 40s and he said the greatest Revival that's ever been said been going now he was saying it own for 15 years he said but why do you realize what's that saying come on do you do you realize what's being said wouldn't that be the same as taking some somebody that had everything in the world and all of the doings and everything and you walk right up in your fa their face and they're telling you they've got all and they and they have it and you walk up to them and said you ain't got it that don't don't on you I you you say he was a prophet you say that he was had the word of God and he preached a message called where Pentecost failed the greatest Revival the world has ever seen now I'm not I'm quoting him so see you got your ideas no that ain't I believe it's well now you can say what you want to I'm going to stay what he says the greatest Revival's ever been and then he's rebuking the people right right while it's going on it's easy to think of back in the say the 40s 50s coming on up into you know the 60s things had started drying away but still remember look at all of the great mve that was going on in the 60s that don't see you'll never understand what he means until you get it settled in your own heart and life of understanding how would it be that Christ would be as we read it just now on the outside of the door a church knocking to try to get back in you know what you're going to put it you're going to put it that they rejected brother brandham now he puts it different we know he done that we know he turned down the message and sent wouldn't let the messeng we know he had 500,000 here and 30 over here maybe 10 in the meetings and that sure we know that but just remember he was already saying that 61 I got some in here 61 62s and there even before the seal broke and he was already rebuking the Pentecostals then how do you think that he was put out what was he saying how can you say that Christ is outside the door knocking trying to get back in when he's inside Healing The Sick great moves are taking place great things are happening but you say he's outside the door that that don't ring a bell with you or make you at least say hey well I wish I could know about this or why because you know you admit that it's true think we better settle down to find out what's going on could it be that we have him outside the door hope not no he's right here well do you get to setting your Pentecostal people had the great move they are still having great moves great things are taking place but yet we say he's not there well who's doing it who's who's doing it who's there Healing The Sick who's there in all the things you see we get it all we think well well and then see I know then I come along and say and then have I been become your enemy then because I tell you the truth you say but we've got this great moves and brother see we'll say here people will say but brother Dale we don't have the great moves like it's over in brother so and so's Church the great anointings the great things that are happening I agree with you I agree with you but are you going to say that we don't have anything but they do are you going to put it on the move the anointing or what are you going to put it on what is your reason for being in Lula well this ain't nowhere else to go I'm sorry that that don't fit too good so you see the setting of where I'm at of what I'm talking about and we talked about this morning we talked about coming from we we've been talking about the dispensations right and we talked about the great dispensations coming down and we spent a lot of services on the son of man dispensation getting that down and getting him as the Healer the Savior the Redeemer even to him that spoke us into being and that's the only way he can be the father that he wanted to be was to be the son of man and bringing it forth and then this morning we talked about going from changing dispensation and remember the quote I gave you I'll give it to you maybe in here I know I'll got it for Wednesday or not but for next Sunday you know that the great things always happen at the time of a changing dispensation it's always been he said when the change of dispensation come said there's a great things take place well you think about it this is an example when isusa Street came was not there a great move wouldn't that a change of dispensation all right then when brother brandham stepped onto the scene during the time of the ausa street moving that was still going on in the 40s and 30s great things were taking place we need to consider where we're at and what's going on so well we're in the message well all right that's that's fine as we'll get to it in a few minutes in the message in Isaiah 4 And1 it talks about and this is speaking of Israel I know but it's speaking of the last days that in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread we our own garment only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach amen it used to be that it was a shame for a woman to have a baby it's not a shame to have 10 or 15 long as she got somewhere where she got married one time down through life at least you know can't you see then the churches saying you know just let us be called by thy name I mean do you really think now listen I'm trying to be serious as serious can be do you think that the Baptist don't want God in their church I mean you is there a sign up at the door God you don't come in here but but yet the Bible says he's on the outside the door knocking that's right well the Pentecostal don't have signs all over the place God not welcomed in here no how about the people of this message is it signs over the door we don't want God inside here no let us be called by thy name come Among Us Lord and work all miracles and signs and wonders wasn't that what they done when he was alive was he not welcomed when he was Healing The Sick and casting out devils and feeding the people well what about the hour and the day we're living in right so we spoke this morning about how that he he was son of man you know and gave his life to to release that Son of God that was inside of him and when it did and on the day of Pentecost when it came back it started another dispensation the prophet said he said this is the dispensation of the Son of God he said it's not son of man now this is Son of God well then I even have given you illustration over and over that you have nobody mentioning son of man the great Apostle Paul and all of the writings they don't talk about son of man can't you see then that's what took place that was so hidden until the Son of God was there but it was not the dispensation if it had been the dispensation of you know of of that it would have come into being for the church what I mean so he gave his own life that the son of God God come in could come into being and on the day of Pentecost it would start another dispensation a dispensation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost a dispensation of Christ coming and living in you a dispensation of eternal life imparted to the people of God and Son of man's not mentioned because it's not supposed to be just as while Jesus was here he was son of man son of man son of man didn't mention Son of God now come on there is places in there that he says things and and all like that and that's one thing I like about brother brandham he he never made it to where he would say you can't find him saying Son of God then you'll hear him in the message and say see there he called himself Son of God but what he's meaning is what he's saying as a whole of the whole m message in the hour was son of man but at the same time he was the son of God all right so now as we're going into this don't lose what I'm getting at he gave his life release the life as son of man dispensation where the Holy Ghost could come into the people and be the Son of God and would be that we gave it over and over this morning son of God dispensation down through the church ages right and just as you would say that he never said anything about it when he was son of man he never mentioned Son of God he'd always say son of man all right then when you get into the church ages it's never mentioned in son of man because that's not the dispensation it was the son of God dispensation but all at once right at the end supposed to be the end of of the age a prophet comes on the scene and he begins to talk about son of man mankind couldn't understand why he was talking about that they couldn't follow him other than he was declaring they thought himself to be a prophet and that was great cuz that was what was taking place but that was not all of it remember I said this morning you know I could spend great times speaking and we could we could spend weeks and months talking about this son of God dispensation but the main thing I want you to get is the son of man and what he was doing made way that it could change dispensations and to come into Son of God dispensation right see now in this age and time it's going to have to come back to where that the Son of God Will Make Way for the son of man statue of perfect man all the way up through here till you get to where it says holy spirit is Son of God headstone is the son of man you tell me what else it would be right see then you'll see why I kept asking the question why is it the son of man had to return in the life last days it's just not as we say God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet thank God but what about the rest of the story didn't they preach brother brandom as a sheath wave right you've heard those things preached you that he was a she wave and know no Jes Jesus Christ is a sheep wave but he was waved through brother brandom we thank God for that see we know the truth but you know the truth is hard to believe right that's why there's so much lying okay all right let's get to going but now so we talk about this morning that the son of man gave his life just the son of God can come into being on the day of Pentecost all right now then we're going to deal with we'll mention a little bit about the son of man but not very much because it will take us into another message totally but we're going to talk about this son of man and what we're going to I mean Son of God and what we're going to talk about is how the Son of God was put out of the church and the Son of God is the spirit God God right am I right now Spirit God but how is the spirit God put out of the church when everybody in the church is crying and hollering and praising him well brother you're just you're just too strong them people they really love God with all of their heart I ain't saying it don't I ain't saying they don't I'm just asking what's wrong come on you've been in the message 10 20 30 40 years 50 60 50 years at least and going on into toward 60 and you don't think about what's going on in the hour and the time that we're living right or is it just woman in the White House Russia coming after oil may I say more or brother randam coming back and putting up a tent all across the country that goes with it just me to anything else cuz I done told you over and over where I stand I've done put that I done warned you too if you think brother Brown going to come back a tent and put it up and come across the country just remember the devil's going to beat him to it cuz he knows the story you say well he don't know about this he's heard brother randam and he's heard plenty of preachers talking about tents and you think he ain't going to forun it how are you going to know who's who well I'll know okay all right praise God I'm just trying to warn us not to put everything upon one point that's right brother bradam said the the Bible speaks of a time had come that the moon would turn to blood people are still in the message arguing by when brother Brown done said it he said I can show you where that's already took place well I don't know where it took place well you can say well it's the church it's this it's that and that I said all right brother Brown didn't tell us that's what it was he just told us he just said I can show you that's already taking place but what if we're looking for something that's already taking place no you're you're you're you're okay I'm putting all of that in one category the same category that I'm talking about when I started how is it that you got a church of a 100 people 100 people 500 people whatever and they're all clapping their hands and praising God and Glory Hallelujah I love the Lord and tears just rolling and they're crying and they're praying and they're they mean it seriously mean it and God's outside the door according to the Bible well now you don't well now that's up to you now the only thing I'm going to say is one point about it if you believe he's outside the church anything you want to make it Pentecostal Baptist Methodist brandit or whatever and keep our little group and said no he's not outside of our church he's he's inside our church if you're going to do all of that you know and have all of that I want to ask you why he's the outside the church well you say automatically in your mind that they've turned down the word well that's true but yet there were still rejoicing about the God I mean show me one Christian church with any sense whatsoever that would get up and say we don't want God in here no they're crying they're praying they're rejoicing and yet God has left them could it be again like it was in the Bible didn't Titus when he came into Jerusalem that the people run into the temple because it was a sensible place to go because they thought God would fight for them and they run into the temple but come find out they had killed the god of the temple now I didn't have nothing to do with killing him you make those statements to me you know what they mean what you're doing right now and what's in your mind God knows and he knows what you're thinking now and would do now you would have done then that's right okay trying to be sensible about the message and look at it straight blunt and see but brother Dale I love the Lord Jesus with all of my heart I would give everything and they truly mean it but why they will they not receive the word well that's just what you're saying about it we've got the word may I quotee brother brand he said they have just enough of the word to make it work do you need that quote they not a church that ain't built on something about the word what makes us different than anybody else you don't I know evidently you don't consider that but what about it so let's go ahead and get started on the quoting part all right because you can argue what I got to say but at least it's up here and you got to read it has left up to you go ahead with number one we pull it up it's the the mighty conqueror preached in 1956 all right look as he's coming down on Earth and was not to be made made an angel he came down on Earth and took the form of a bondsman not an angel not come down in great Jehovah Glory but and what but come came down as a man to redeem man to die for man to die for as a man he never died as God cuz God can't die that's sensible he died as a man the sin of man was upon the son of man and he had to become a man in order to pay the penalty so he paid the price the son of man he never died as God you can't kill God the people in this message about the river Jordans and this up there well it had to be this and it had to be that one of the men says you know my God can't die well brother Bram said God died then he says God can't die well he's confused I ain't cuz my God can't die go ahead I guess we need to be following you but come on Church but now look look at the next one just tying back to the morning where we'll get the talk and watch how it ties so perfectly to and shows you the end time that there's going to have to be two dispensations to come into being at one time which has never been before Son of God and son of man is going to have to overlap in this a is last dispensation cuz you can't take it with one by itself so listen to what he says he's talking about it the lest Church age 1960 he comes down the first back there I'm last over here and I'm the beginning of the creation of God once through the church ages that we're to have you will learn that I'm God did not each Church age get a revelation of the Supreme de deity right each age has got a revelation of supreme so you should be every age should be at least in every Age The Bride did have the connection to believe in God as real no matter what age it is all right now look he said learned that I God God created in a man form I'm the beginning of the creation of God he said I don't to make a presbyterian shout the creation of God when was God created when God was made flesh in Jesus Christ and dwelt Among Us right back to the son of man but it's to be known down Through the Ages what that he's God it will wind up in this age knowing he's the beginning of the creation of God there was God in human flesh the overlap everything is tied together all right so watch now watch the next one when then we'll get our Point look at number three the Mighty God then we find after his death burial and Resurrection he came on the day of Pentecost as Son of God God the spirit in the form Holy Ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to the people in a different form there's your dispensation like the Holy Spirit which is God he came to deal through the church ages as Son of God the Holy Spirit same God all the time right now so he's revealing himself to every age as a revelation of his deity but it winds up in our marvelous statement in the end time to this age as the age comes down to an end and he gets to the 20th verse which is automatically the 21st and 22nd is to the Overcomer but he rebukes remember he's preaching to both true and false in every age is that right and he comes down to say he's on outside the door knocking trying to get back in I'll quote one and then get back to it he said what about the Son of God outside of his church see because you're automatically going to run to the bases to try to prop up your thoughts and because you don't have any to understand the Str you're going to run back to well it was a son of man that will go with it but he was put out as Son of God don't you see the embarrassment of the situation I'm talking about brother R said ain't that embarrassing ain't that a shame that he's outside of his own church go home tonight put a tape on about 50 or early 60 and listen and hear him rebuking the Pentecostals that are still in the midst of a great Revival a great move among them you don't listen and think like that why would he be rebuking the Pentecostals why would not he be praising them all the time he does praise them because it's true but the biggest portion you know is a rebuke cuz remember what he would be saying if he said you methodists can look at the Lutheran he said you Pentecostals can look at the Methodist but he said I can look at you you say it was only sure it is in there the son of man is what gets turned down but remember his rebuke is before the son of man comes into being on the basis of the dispensation you I just don't understand you you just say things church I'm trying my best to tell you and me what if Christ is outside of this church trying to get in and yet we're crying and praying and singing and worshiping every bit of every service what if he cannot come in the door but I don't see that no it's cuz you don't want to see it because you realize what I'm saying that if he's outside the door of this church then I don't care what the worship is inside the worship inside and the great things and the movement is the anointing it is not the person of God it is the anointing the great signs and wonders is this the most deceiving age that there is is it the scripture would say that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible see I'm going to automatically quote but we can't be deceived brother randam said you need this one he said frankly he get the bride so messed up you know what he said he'd have to cut the work short you need that one see I just don't want you and I to settle in to a point we're in the message and then we settle in to a we know more about the message than these other churches do and I'm not going to back up and say we don't I hope you don't because if if you don't why don't you go to the other churches cuz you know what you're saying you're saying this is not right well then you need to go with what's right that's but brother Dale I've never heard nobody talk to way you talk you never will because I just talk like I am I've always been this way I've never had anything else why change now right but see think about about it he said he was changing himself he came and dealt Through the Ages as Son of God well see he's still dealing cuz listen you want the quote you got the quotes I know what you're talking about I know where they're at I don't mean the pay right now but I can find them in a hurry where brother Brown said the lady you see and age is over but then what about the quote I was just looking at a minute ago just out run across it he said the lady o age is not over he said it don't end until the Rapture or the tribulation would end the lady you'll see an age which you know what then I can give you another quote he said the lady see and age will go on until it strikes a millennium because it's still under a seven that's what to say we say we know all about it we're ready to go are we watch now go ahead to number four guess I got some A's on these so if I hit the wrong one I'll catch up with you which is the Feast of the trumpets 1964 now he's been revealed through the church ages now watch through the church ages as Son of God God being the spirit the holy Spirit he revealed himself in the church ages as in the congregation as the Holy Spirit among the people we find in the ladyo age the last Church age he is put out of the church nowhere else was he ever put out in any age but in the lady oan age say we're rich and have need of nothing he said was put out of the church don't say well it's only cause brother brandham came and started he came to rebuke them because they got away from Pentecost amen right see then they naturally turned him down but just remember the point I'm making to you is the if you throw the son of man out and you keep the son of got in what kind of a thing have you got you got a split part of your God that's right you said well I just don't see how they could how they could put out because if they're in there worshiping and having a good time that's what I'm telling you you can worship and shout and scream and holler the sick can be healed all kind of Miracles and yet God be on the outside no no I can't be because he's inside doing it well maybe we need to close our doors and go over there no if they've got the anointing and signs and wonders are taking place and we have not as much as they have don't you think we might order to change places and if that's true then I'll ask you the other part of the question why did you leave right why did you leave if that's what it is well I just don't understand how the the move of God can be you don't understand the end time as the anointed ones with the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit right look what he says on number five and it says Investments 1963 in Revelations 3 we read that to the lest in church Chase we're pictured one of the most saddest pictures of all the Bible Revelation 3 at the lady ofan Church all the rest of the churches through the Lutheran age the seven Church ages each one it didn't said about Jesus being in the church in other words watch what he said he that's in the church but in the lady ofan he was on the outside in other words every age you know he's talking every age it was in the church it was speaking to the of the spirit in the church and the last one he's outside the church now you can like this or lump it I don't care because it's truth the first sermon I preached in this message was going Beyond man's Camp you know the Bible says that he suffered without the gate and you know what it says you know the rest of the scripture he suffered without the G it says we must go unto him if he's outside the gate get your scripture if he's outside the door we're supposed to be out there don't you want to be where he's at well you're over here where they're shouting Glory Hallelujah but there's something wrong cuz he's out there the Bible says that we've got to go out to him right okay but in the lady oan age lady he was on the outside knocking trying to get back in what a pitiful thing to think that the Son of God knocking on his own church trying to get back in now you better start with the Son of God being the one that's put out don't start with just son of man being put out start with Son of God being put out but yet do you see this whole story of what I'm talking about the most pitiful side in the world is what God can't get back in his own church but yet inside the building the people are shouting Glory Hallelujah wonderful shouting Glory great signs and wonders taking place which one do you want do you want to be outside the church where God is or you want to be inside Church where all the shouting and Glory Hallelujah is I didn't write the story I'm just reminding you of it it was a Son of God Spirit God we just read back before Spirit God God in spirit form put out of the church see that's why brother brandham will say listen he will say the lady oan age is ended he will say we're not in the ladyo see an age we're in the bride age but just remember ever Church age was in the bright age no matter what age it is that's the bright age because see the church it doesn't make no difference from the day of Pentecost is starting you got to go where God is but this is the only age that it pitifully looks like and sees it as him totally put out of his church what is put out of his church come on let think what's put out of his shirt when everything is still there and the shouting and the Glory Hallelujah and the Great Signs and wonder why is it you can't tell them the truth why was it brother brandham couldn't tell him the truth he had the signs and wonders and the Vindication to back it up do you think they wanted him come on folks get a little bit into the story if it hadn't been for who was it the the one over the businessmen say if it hadn't been for the one from who is it Louisiana where was from somebody say it because I can't remember if it hadn't been for him brother Brandon wouldn't have been in the businessmen's meetings they wanted to put him out and he say you put him out you put me out and he was the head of it right back more was one of it but there was others into the thing it's kind of like I remember the story happened brother molim was telling about and some of you can remember the the lady's name that was a great move know I thing and uh they asked her said what do you think about brother mine's meeting she said never seen nothing greater except in my own right except in my own do you think seriously I'm not degrading nobody do you think or Roberts thought that brother brandham was above him now if you do I I've got some stock in alcatra I'd like to sell you out of the church at the clothes in other words you ain't got sense at all oh Roberts thought brother brandamore would be sitting under him he was getting thousands of Miracles and signs and wonders and brother Brown getting this a handful did brother brandham say that do you need that quote that brother around and said that about all Roberts well why don't we go with all Roberts oh it's dead now well you got a good one don't you but what about this lady you see an age what about a situation that's the burden on my heart to think of because I've had it there for 40 50 years it's burdened it why you can't explain people to God I mean people about God I was talking to a man one time and I told him I said your problem is your gift brother dony to tell you about a certain man he knows if we talked about the reason he's not in this church today is because he's got a gift the man has in his life that'll work but he don't see it working in anybody else so why would he go with anybody else he goes by himself lives like the devil because God can't be mad at him he's got a gift he Church the burden has been on my heart for all these years about the Bride of Jesus Christ that you're so easily deceived I told you we sat one night and and this man preached a whole message and all that was totally wrong and the people was certain ones was running their aisles shouting Glory Hallelujah and the next day I said but he was wrong and never come back to church now you think I'm a nasty dirty old guy don't you I tried to save their souls I became an enemy to a man till he wouldn't even speak to me because I pulled his church out of polygamy that they were already talking about and I'm not telling it wrong telling it right they were already talking about who the women were to go home with and they asked me to speak in a Minister's meeting and I'm just plain as I can be I said why would you want 10 wives I said you got a left demon on you until that man died right before he died I called him on the phone and his wife went and told him said brother Dale's called he said brother who I can hear him on the phone he come to home who is is this I I said brother Dale you know that used to be your brother oh oh brother Dale and I pulled a whole church two of them as a matter of fact out of polygamy but I become their enemy I'm sorry I'm not sorry for telling the truth I'm sorry really that I hadn't been harder about it because people are not going to listen to you anyway like just talking about it now what are you going to do we're in the end time when the anointing is poured out that's we're in the end time when great signs and wonders can take place even in churches that don't believe in the Virgin birth don't believe in brother brandom don't believe in one God don't believe the truth they're in polygamy they're in all kind of things you said don't worry yes it does if a person has ever heal God does a healing ain't nobody can heal the devil can't and you're sure can't and I can't but yet we don't think about it we we just love the Lord Brother I just love the Lord with my body my soul my spirit and I'll be at church next week in case if it don't rain that was the old saying about your girlfriend you remember that telling her how much you loved her you know honey I love you so much I just can't be away from you and I'll see you next week if it don't rain I just pulled it up into is it the truth come on try to get you to life before you won't be so dull on me but listen you said no brother Dale it was the son of man that was put out I've got some more in here that we'll get back and you he'll keep talking about the Son of God being put out of his church see the Son of God is the holy spirit Spirit God that's right and he's on the outside of the church trying to get back in but he's on the inside the church Healing The Sick that can't be comprehended but are you going to tell me it ain't true are you going to be blind enough to tell me that that's not true that that's not happening if God comes right over there and heals one person God done the healing right yeah but he can't get in that door is he knocking I've been around I've been back there when they preached that I stand at the door knock is God trying to get into your heart but that's not just trying to get into your heart it's trying to get in the church and the church is when that put him out the church it claims him as their savior their healer their all in all and yet they've put him out let's read some things about what it is but I'm going to read this cuz where we won't get lost on it so we'll we'll read one where you won't get lost on what I'm talking about and you think I'm leaving the son of man out of it so we'll read one right here go ahead the message called the trial 1964 and look now what did he promise to vindicate himself in a man a human flesh like he did to Abraham brother randam right in a human flesh like he did to Abraham that man that stood out there talking to Abraham the flesh man outside wasn't God mzc was inside the man right so brother brandham is not God we're not going that route we're going look when the son of man it would be the son of man not not not not not Son of God now the Son of God in a son of man so God was using brother brandham and he was out of the church right we can look at that we can look at him being put out cuz you got where he couldn't go nowhere but what about God had already been put out of the church I just reading that with son of man so we just make sure you don't think it I'm just I'm just putting this on in one thing no because in the last days it was Son of God in a son of man to bring the message we'll get back to the AR where brother R said I am not the son of man he said I'm a son of man he said I wish you could get that straight the seventh angel messenger is not God Amen all right but look on the message Jehovah in 1962 which would be number seven and we realize that the Pentecostal Church in the last days is the lady oan Church age the only one that Christ would put out of the church standing knocking trying to get back in he said God be merciful what was put out that would be talking about son of God go ahead number eight the trial and he said the seven Church age which is the L in in church age well we would admit that this is the Lady of in age congregation says amen remember he the word was put out of the church it's not the spirit to be put out of the church it's the word but just remember in final analysis God has to go where his word is so his word is outside okay remember he the word was put out of the church that's right put out of the church and he was on the outside trying to get back in I stand at the door knock brother around knock and and all like that noce th not that you're miserable blind naked what about what God is saying to them and don't know it he was on the outside the word what is it our Traditions our Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecost Trad Traditions has rejected the word of God Amen and he can have no more corpor no Corporation nowh everybody is hands off of it and want to call it an evil spirit and you understand that Jesus said in the last days before the coming of the end time that he would be revealed as son of man not Son of God and that fulfills Malachi 4 and all these other Promises of Abraham the life sign that Abraham receive who was waiting for a coming son God revealed in a human be being and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so do you won't misunderstand me and accuse me of putting brother brandom out of it just remember I'm putting him right where he's supposed to be right the word was put out but they wanted brother brandham to come am I right in his early Ministry is that identical to the Lord Jesus in Jesus's early Ministry they wanted him to come as signs and wonders right but the word had already been put out you said well no no they read it every day your Traditions your things see goes into this ecclesiastical look at the next let's do number nine then I'll quit reading CU I got a whole slew in here if you doubt me on it then uh one I like I I got one in here in a minute where he where he said said he he spewed us out of his mouth and the next statement was and we spewed and they spewed him out he spewed them out they spewed him out look the Bible said he would be put out of the church and the seventh Church age he would be put out of the church it'll go completely black is that the way the church Ages were Dro right where does it black out it goes into this ecclesiastical system into this ecumenical council World Council of churches she he has put completely out his word they can't agree with it you know they can't they can't even agree in their own little local groups how are they're going to agree and that you don't think about the people of this message how that there's so many different groups that won't even agree with each other and they got one message to do it by okay they can't even agree in their own little local groups how they going to agree in that so they take another mark of the beast an image unto the Beast what about people that are shouting Glory Hallelujah and God is among them doing signs and wonders and yet the people's already taking the mark of the beast come on that's why you got your anointed ones and remember in the Bible if a man give you a sign and it come to pass you're supposed to believe him that's one scripture another scripture if man gives you a sign and it comes to pass but he takes you to another God you're not supposed to believe and what's the rest of that scripture the rest of it says God sent him among you to try you God would do that he has like I said do you think or Roberts would agree that his ministry wasn't greater than brother brandham what do you think about it he didn't close his buildings and go with him till osbor all of them see that knew him see as I said about Jesus they wanted him as long as he was a prophet and Healing The Sick but when he begin to say I and my father one brother Bram said and these other things when brother brandham come forth preaching what was their problem what was against him what is it on God's generals you ever read the book it talks about brother randam and God's generals the only one in the book that they attacked his Doctrine check it what 50 or more people maybe in there that he spoke of the only one that they attacked his Doctrine and see what was their idea brother brandham you should have stayed with the gift right you should have stayed with the praying the sick said you got out of that when you started trying to preach the word and what did he say he said them people don't understand right he said the healings and signs and wonders would only get the attention to people where they listen to the word right you say they've got signs and wonders here the spirit's moving among them Glory you know the only thing I've ever said about that you said when brother so and so is preaching I can shout well you mean you can't shout when the truth is being preached but you can shout when error is being preached come on I'm not mean I'm just truthful is it right yes but I just feel so good why brother so and so is preaching well go on you're hindering me and I'm hindering you go with them I'm not trying to run nobody off but this church was never built on trying to get anybody to come to it I called a man the other day when I got through talking to him for about two seconds I wish to God I had never called a man I'm sorry that I called him that's why I'm like I am folks if you leave you're supposed to come tell me why you leave I'm not supposed to call you up try to find out why you left you're supposed to come tell me why you're leaving can I quote brother brand you have no right to leave a church this is not them days of spiritual husbands that we were down in Athens Georgia with years ago of trying to make you go to a church I'm just telling it like it is brother Brown says you have no right to read leave a church except it be over a Doctrine I didn't say that your Prophet did but you see I don't make those statements to lamb B you I've never felt bad at anybody that's left I've never said anybody that's left here left the word because that's not up to me it's up to you to go where God leads you to go but you say but you turn right around and say but you go after the anointing and you leave the word right is it true can you shout over Arrow when you can't shout when the truth is being preached do you you understand how that it was the son of God that was put out of the church then Here Comes brother Brown alone they had already denominated they had already split they' already pulled apart and all kind of denominational situations oness two this three this fourness is whatever and then brother brandham comes on the say and he's welcomed in the beginning a little bit because of the gift and the ministry reason it thing but when he begin to lay it down and begin to preach they gradually begin to walk away from him why because they had already put the word out before he started preaching listen if you can't agree whether it's Trinity or not if you can't get that straight or predestination or or eternal hell and thing the Bible said that in the faith of the fathers do you see what brother randam is saying they turned down this word this word never taught a trinity they never taught those doctrines they already had them doctrines before Brother brandom come on the scene they had already put the word out can we do the same and we put the word out but yet we want the god in do you understand there is nobody to put up a sign we don't want God in this church but by our Creeds and our dogmas and ideas is God in the church or outside the church we ain't even concerned about son of man cuz they'd already rejected God before brother brandham ever come on the scene that's what he said because come on he started out preaching against what they was doing right 40s that he was rebuking the Pentecostals see we can turn him out and he can be outside the church and we can be inside shouting Glory Hallelujah now answer me the one question and I'll quit when the people when Titus come into Jerusalem the people run back into the temple right what was they doing in the temple what was they doing in the temple first off they thought that's where God was right the reason it went which is inside they wouldn't sitting there we don't know what we doing we they was in there Glory Hallelujah we are the people of God he's not going to let them attack this Temple because we are the people of God and we're in the temple of God and I feel the anointing uh may I remind you about Moses and Aaron and them and the anointing was actually on some of those people that was against Moses where did Pharaoh's men get those snakes if you think there's not anointings and things right you haven't listened to the message anointing anointed ones the end time lately the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit anointing the people and they've rejected the word he doesn't quit anointing them because they rejected the word he keeps anointing them until it's finished and then to judgment they will find out right because may I quote the scripture is it not so that it's a judgment they will say preachers have not I cast out Devils have not I healed a sick and he'll say depart from me I never knew you and the guy over on the other side he saids Lord I've never been worth nothing ain't never done nothing for you but one day Lord you cross my path and I deserve hell said you change that is that just a story no musicians is that just a story that we tell Christ could be outside the church yeah we got communion excuse me yeah to pull the thing up we got communion could it be that Christ could be outside of this little church in Lula course I know what everybody says no cuz I'm in here I'm not dirty I'm just straight if you are in here and God's out there you're supposed to go out there we're supposed to go out under him well bless God you're just trying to run me off I ain't never tried to run nobody off but I've always tried to be truthful I preach it like it is to give my family my children my Offspring and you that listen an opportunity to hear God's word as best as I can find it and preach it and never make it a lopsided one side of a fire right is it not true I'm quoting right have to from somebody else but is it not true that when brother brandham said that woman to die at 2:00 orever what it was you know right and they had a meeting and in the meeting they prophesied Di and then she's not going to die is it not true you've heard the story told Billy Paul went to his daddy and he said Daddy they had the meeting and said they prophesied and listen he said it was the spirit of God he said but Billy ain't God ain't spoke to me she died right on that time anointings I have to say what brother K Atkin said that time my life he said brother you told the truth he said if anointing is built upon anointing he said brother Dale he said me and you ain't much anointed I had to agree with him you know I had to say you're right because there not much anointing you know I have to agree to that all right let's stand together we're going into the communion and foot washing and I just hope you go home and think about what it said but the way that it's said and the love that I've sent it in for you to try to get you to see who you are and where you're at and what's going on in your life don't never place it on gifts and signs and wonders right was it not the prophet that said someday I'll show you even the gifts that he used he said someday I'll show you that that wasn't right why did he put everything he had on the word what does the word say for have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you let the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s say it this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come let's just take a few moments and pray silently before the Lord before we get into the communion part father you just make us all worthy to be the partakers of this part that's been delivered unto us you told us to do it until you return and we know for certain that you're not completed in your returning yet so we keep on taking communion just have your way with us sanctify the people and the partakers the food the things make it all for you and your honor we love you and we thank you in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you this has been made for this day and we thank you for that the hands that made it for us and now we just ask you we know it's not your body and we know it's not the word but we know that it's in representation of the word and the body so we just ask you to sanctify this as we eat it and we ask you to just make us to be what you want us to be in the Kingdom forgive our sins and cleanse us sanctify this food to the the nourishment of our bodies and because we know that it'll be doing that we love you and we thank you in Jesus name what a great time and understanding that we could have of what it is to about the communion and to not be so confused over something that would be make us to be to a point that we think we're right but we're not help us to understand as my prayer they started this out in the beginning and it'll be the last thing I hope that we're doing when the change comes because then we just step right over to the marriage supper and we'll just continue what we're doing what a wonderful opportunity you shall know the truth and truth shall set you free amen father we thank you for this wine as went through the process now getting better each day we ask you to just sanctify the wine in us with it we know it represents your blood for us we know it represents that the bread that we eat represents the word and we know that the the wine that we drink represents the spirit of God to Quicken that word it'll be natural blood cells created by eating and partaking of this and father make sure that it's spiritual to us also we love you and we thank you in Jesus name come morning our by the river I'll rest the Green Tree I'll carry ye my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by the river I rest neath the Ever Green Tree I carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me what an opportunity to know the truth you don't never thank God about that I thank God for all of those churches to where I was and how they taught me the best that they could do I thank God for that I have no problem I left the churches back there I went to them and told them that I appreciated all they' done you know I've never left a church that I didn't tell the pastor I appreciate it and I do but what about it do you thank him for that I ain't going to thinkk him because of them denomination remember the Bible says the prophet says they were School Masters to bring us to Christ what if you didn't have a school Master you would have never got to Christ oh he'd have found me somewhere oh you're a good believer in predestination right but it just don't hold true he found Jew because you were looking for him we don't follow that on predestination do we he was calling us but then you started searching for him right let's Aller take together you can be seated for a moment till I get everything ready and turn to John the 13th chapter and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Hisar Simon's son to betray him and Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is worh needeth not Sav to wash his feet but is clean every witht and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them you know what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together and be dismissed and the sisters can go downstairs for the foot washing and just remember brother Aaron will be preaching for us Lord withing Wednesday so be much in prayer father we thank you for this day and the opportunity of been here and we pray what has been said would be worth listening because it come from our heart as to that way and we pray that some would miss we know they'll Miss understand the words we use and what we're saying but surely we're not doing but one thing and that's glorifying you we love you and we thank you guide each one of us Lord and as we finish the footworks and take care of everybody on the way home thank you for the rain Lord It's just bathing the Earth and everything so wonderful that it's coming down just gradually and soaking in into the ground you are so wonderful truly you are good and we thank you in Jesus name amen you're dismissed
