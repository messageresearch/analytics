========================================

things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written they're in for what the time is at hand the time to understand right now in revelations 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there were silence in heaven about the space of in half an hour you may be seated lord had his blessing sister regina has a testimony she wants to give us while she's coming up i'll just make this comment you know a lot of people's tried to figure out how much time one half an hour but you got a problem because it said about the space so you remember back in the bible there that it says the sun stood still for about a day it didn't say a whole day right so part of it was left off you had to go on over to pick it up they're getting it and line it back up remember those things come on sister regina i am i want to testify to something that brother dale said at the end of the second service last week and he said thank him for your pain and i want to start with a question can i see a show of hands for who knows that i have back issues not as many as should know once i share the medical diagnosis with you the medical diagnosis is these three things degenerative disc that means they decline over the span nerve impingement pinched nerves and last but not least severe spinal stenosis that's a narrowing of the spinal canal the column that's the diagnosis i'm not on any drugs i don't take neurotin muscle relaxers anything like that over here with my god and my father i live a grateful thankful attitude every single day amen i thank him for everything i thank him for the pain i thank him for the good times i thank him for the bad times he has blessed me to sit on that row with the gibby's they know when i'm having a challenge they will lay hands on me and it flees just like that um for those who don't know the power of that language for the diagnosis i'll break it down further i went to see an orthopedic once and the assistant was reading the mri and he said oh my gosh you are in a lot of pain how are you even standing it's by the amazing grace of god that i am not on medication i might have to take a couple of ibuprofen but that may be two or three months just because i'm having a challenge but i just wanted to share this brother dale gets the opportunity to hear where his little flock is so don't be afraid to testify amen but i appreciate the lord i appreciate the kidneys i appreciate brother dale and i appreciate you for listening thank you amen you know even one thing about pain you know if you didn't have pain there's a lot of things you'd die of that you wouldn't know to get treatment for right you say well a child has a temperature when i don't like for them to have them either but you realize you have a temperature you know right that means something in your body's wrong so you you get help if it didn't you would die right right but thank god for pain all right but the main thing is what the healer comes to take the pain away that's the main part of the healer amen and we appreciate that but around said if god does something for one to order encourage others to uh you know receive and to believe amen now we've been talking for quite a while on the the seals we've come up now to the seventh seal to where that we're going to be speaking for a little while on this and uh i want you to think about these things and i'll repeat this in a minute but what is it that we've been talking about the seals we've been talking about what it reveals um what it shows you know and the time-wise of a lot of it you know the earthly happenings of those things and uh you know trying to understand that because that's written in the word but what is the main thing that i've been trying to get you to consider or keep in mind that what it reveals to you and i mean you say well the first see a white horse rider you know we got that see all right you got the symbol you got the symbol but what does it reveal to you amen when we know that the prophet said to seals and things like that we go out in a rapture in revelation 4 1 not seen until 1921 and then he says the seals and these things are not even pertaining to us it's pertaining to israel but see we are supposed to get the revelation amen all right through the opening of the seal and in doing that then we see that it's christ revealing himself to the church amen all right now and then we'll see in a minute what why that's so vital he said well we just read what the prophet says and we believe it well that's wonderful and that's wonderful that's what we read there in revelation blessed is he that readeth and hear these things that's a blessing because a lot of the world knows nothing about these things that you and i talk about on a common basis we'd call it or an everyday thoughts you know they know nothing about it you just think what if we were in that shape right man all right then you come into the message part and you get into it and people then says but but we don't need to go too far now and go get too far out because we could miss it well i i don't know how far you can get out to make you miss it now if you get off you miss it right but if we get enough to get us changed i don't think that's too far out right i think that's what it's supposed to do but see we miss it by you know trying to self-interpret right we we've had a profit to give us the words you'll see in a moment why we depend upon that so much you know because that if god had not sent a prophet to us in the last days you and i would be exactly like the religious world system that would know nothing about redemption oh yeah we would be talking about jesus we would preach that he saved us he heals us he he delivers us and maybe one of these days we're going to get to go to heaven where he's at or something see and we wouldn't know anything about it so i thank god just for the intellectual conception right right to just to be able to read that's right and here listening last night we worked around him on questions and answers and him explaining uh hebrews hebrews 6 you know and to just think that we always wondered about those things you know when we wonder how that that would be and then here comes a prophet just makes it so simple until it's just amazing amazing to us you know but now as we approach this i said i'll probably repeat this many times because to me it's what is revealed to you and i through the opening of the word right amen because we can say well the prophet said so and so well that's wonderful but has he revealed himself to you the bible doesn't say that we're waiting on the prophet by himself that's right it says we're waiting on the faithful ministry amen one thing to bring the word but then we're waiting on the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the living god to finish up what jesus didn't finish when he was here see that's where people go haywire when you make statements like that but when brother brown makes those statements then you have to listen but see then we read here of when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour that's what i said people's trying to figure out how much that is make it so many years of earthly time you know but now here's the main emphasis this morning it doesn't say a half an hour on earth right right it doesn't say anything about earth that's right in this seal the other is dealing with time and earthly happenings and et cetera et cetera you know tribulations and things but here it says silence in heaven amen now keep that in your mind and keep it in your thoughts because see i'll say it and then come back and prove the point until all the seven seals are revealed to the bride of jesus christ and made manifest there's still silence in heaven i said seven seals is revealed to us right that's right yeah but how in the world brother dale can we find out what this is god sent us a prophet that's right i thought we believed yes amos three and seven amen that he would send it by the prophet right and see we then we we've got to be dependent upon the prophet for the entire bible to be made known see that way we put our whole emphasis upon whether or not god did keep his work and we know he did he did and we know that he will and i wish he would write this down because i wrote it at the top of my notes and i wish he would just jot this down to consider it what we're going to be dealing with for a little while is to see how perfect god's word is how perfect his word is and how he keeps his word he said well that's that's a simple thought that's what i i try to make everything as simple as i can and i know i'm accused of being everything from an intellect to a devil i guess but in a dodie old grouchy god but uh to me the only way we can understand god in his ways is in simplicity he hides himself that he might reveal himself how in simplicity people say that's deep no it was deep before you got to revelation right when it's revealed it's simple that's right damn it anything that's not revealed is deep that's right it doesn't matter what the apex of what your revelation is it's still simple i'm afraid you know why because that way the simple minded can understand that's right you know if an illiterate child according to the prophet can be saved how simple is simplicity see we want to make it the word and talk about that they can't be say well why because the prophet says again you know he can reveal itself to someone who has no education whatsoever see that's where we want to try to make it some deep serious thing instead of the simplicity the prophet would go to a place like africa and preach one sermon and god do some signs and wonders and 30 000 people come to jesus christ right and the women would get up and go put on clothes but nobody has preached to them that they had to put on gloves yeah we think the message is closed and higher than the rest but that's not the new birth the new birth is the birth of the word to bring christ into you as i was trying to bring her this past wednesday on the soul of the individual and what we are you see simplicity simplicity is revealed word intellect is word that's not revealed and in those things then we as we approach something like this we try to look at it in the best way that we can because that's what i've encouraged you as i started off talking to see what these seals revealed to you look around said god opened one of the seals and showed john his name he said has your name been revealed to you through the breaking of the seal but yet we're not supposed to know about these things well i thought man i'm just you know 44 or more years of studying i thought we were supposed to know the plan of redemption i thought that was what we needed to know not that it would just go to church and be good you know but i thought it was to know the plan of redemption well then i thought the prophet said that it was a six seal book of redemption i thought the seals revealed the plan of redemption why wouldn't we want to know that we see church we tried to figure out things with our own intelligence and that's where your intellect is when brother adam would say something he'd say he said i think now there's no writing in the bible that he said i think right but brother random would say that and he said that's where she messed up right it was what her own thought upon what god was going to do see then our thinking if it's not according to god's word is the same thing that happened in the garden of eden because that's where the problem is at right around said that satan stopped up those fluids talking about your spiritual realm right we talked about wednesday night and he messed that up and he said we need to blow them things out but now listen as we approach this seventh seal he said but it says there's silence in heaven for especially half an hour and there's not anything revealed well the first thought is it it says their silence in heaven respects a half an hour so the seal is it's written out in language this it says they're silent so there was challenge now we went through in our study on these things we've covered that seal one two three and four each had a symbol right what was writer read was writer black original hail all right and we went into the fifth and the sixth to see that that they were not symbols so it's be coming negative or partial understanding to perfect understanding see the fifth and sixth seal what we needed from the prophet was to know who those people were but yet the bible says it was people so it's not a symbol the earthquake is not a symbol it's a reality but see now we come to the basis that there's not a symbol but we come to a positive realization of understanding that whatever happens it causes silence in heaven right so i guess we think that what it is all these other things is revealing things and then you're on the seventh it's your silence well then when we get to heaven and still be silent we'll get to it in a moment where the prophet said until these seven seals are revealed we're only presuming amen which means to venture without authority but now what has been the example we've given to understanding or breaking forth of the seals first we look at what they reveal the time wise the earthly happenings events etc but we just didn't stay on that we begin to talk about as i said what does it reveal to you and i right right amen because i told you about it i told you when i first read to see a book after reading the church eight book and many other messages and hearing a lot of tapes that brother moat was very wise and telling me he said i don't suggest you that i wanted that seal book because that always i knew that they were written in the bible i i had read that you know and so he said read these other books and then get around to reading that one i said okay so i kept the word you know i sure did look at that seal book a lot though but i kept a word and i read the things the church eight books and many many messages and then when i got into the seals i was really understanding great things that i had really wondered about you know what did these things mean but then when i came up to the seventh seal i saw something there that really made me think that here's a man telling me what is taking place and as he's telling me he's talking about himself right you remember when you first read yes he was talking about himself and that began to be confusing to me well you know what i've done i'd like to see a book down i went back to reading some of the other messages and i got into the church age book and began to read that one and getting a background of one god and the things that was really needful and then one day i opened the seal book and i began to read and i admit when i came to the seventh seal that it seemed still that this man talking about himself right you know you might don't don't either we should be looking at the bible to find ourselves now you know what we look at the bible to try to find most of the time we look in it to try to engage other people you look around saw donnie goof up the other day see a lot of these dresses get a little too high some of them too old you know in the tops now come on i try to be honest with you instead of trying to read the bible to find ourselves we were reading the bible to find other people yes boy ain't it something about them denominations man ain't that something well look at all that twisted up mess and i i just don't understand how come you can't see what i see when i first read it i seen it that's good brother and i come along and i got a problem dealing with that because i remember the six or eight months of the year or two that it took me to get you to see what you see and of course you don't like that i remember when you argued with me about it i know i'm not supposed to be that old hateful dirty old guy but i i still am and i remember but see after a while then it begins to within you you begin to see that the word is really talking to you we're not to be concerned about what it's talking to everybody else that's right because it's none of our business between them and the lord you begin to get a little different look you begin to read the bible and you begin to see hey he's talking about me how many of you remember when you first saw the water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ yes of course first time you heard it you run out and got it done sorry didn't do it but you remember a little point that i want to get to you that you know we got to noticing it said the name that's right right well you know it wound up that every time i'd read anywhere in the bible i'd find that little word in a me that's right i said well the whole bible bible's full of that word name you ever notice you go buy you a car you got the only green one that's right you drive down the street now comes about 15 green cards you just didn't notice it before see that's what the bible's supposed to is do bring out ourselves into the bases that way we can do something about ourselves it's not what we can do about getting other people ready that's right i conned that phrase that time you know found out it was in the book but a lot of people laughed about it where brother brown would say is your wife worthy of the gospel because everybody thought see 60s 70s and all and that's what they still think if we get the women lined up we're going to rapture well it might be just me that's holding it back you know but you understand what i'm saying i'm trying to talk and something to get you to think that the bible the bible itself is very very simple yes amen because it can speak to the hearts of the most illiterate yes amen and reveal jesus christ to them that's right and you know that could be one rapture it's not the intellect that's going to make the rapture that's right it's the revelation that's right amen now in doing that then we're total as i said and come back to it some more we're totally dependent i mean totally you realize what we're doing today you realize the people of this message now i'm not saying that will work or they don't depend on them because they're always trying to change what the prophet said and do this that or the other yeah but if we're really going to believe that god kept his word and sent a prophet unto us then we must believe that he was sent to bring us the word amen right so that means that we didn't have it right that's right see it took him 30 something years he said to preach up to 62 in the statue of perfect man that's what he said 30-something years of preaching to get a people to the bases that they could believe a little bit and what about when he would get into the seals he gets over the questions and answers and because of the questions that he was receiving that he asked to be specifically on the seals and the question was about her and dress and clothes and pajamas and water baptism brother brown how can jesus and god be one to what he said there in this in the question of nature he said it's gone from you that's right no he hadn't preached it yet that's right but you can see by the questions on the people's heart that they were not getting what he was talking about see church then are we getting it after 40 something years yes why haven't we had 40-something years right you know that moses was down in egypt ready yes to deliver israel come on he was a deliverer he was called right and for 40 years he had to wait that's right and the people until the people got ready that's right brother said calling for a deliverer they hated o moses because you know all moses done to the children of israel on his first journey was increased their taskmasters right that's right come on that's what's happened that's right where they were just doing a certain amount of day then they kept increasing it because of moses's presence that's right them in trouble they certainly didn't want moses do we want the prophet's message is our life now get on to the point i want to run there is our life totally dependent upon whether or not god sent brother branham to you and i remember the scripture that said behold i send you elijah the prophet yes right it didn't say them right right you amen now are we dependent upon that yes or do we still have our own thoughts and ideas right did i take it well that's where we get in trouble right when we start trying to think it out that's right now but like we covered wednesday night see the bible says come let us reason together but around said no senses are no problem if they're lined up with the word god uses those senses to speak to you and i yes to try to bring this the revealed word yes right but now we went through six seals as i said a moment ago seeing that they were dealing with symbols and dealing with actuality of the fifth and sixth seal of seeing people and we had to have a prophet to even tell us what the symbols were we had to have a prophet to tell us what who the people were and it was totally contrary to all of our thinking that's right and he said it was contrary to his thinking so now what are we going to do getting to a seventh seal when it just says there's silence in heaven about the space of half hour as i said while ago then we try to figure out how long that would be thinking that would help us do you know that if we knew the day of the coming of the lord it would only be a hindrance to us yes brothers we would be no more than a maya calendar it went out yesterday world in the end see if you knew the day you wouldn't be prepared until the day got there right it's true i mean you go down now it's a good idea you know you say well i'm going to take a vacation somewhere in november well you know what's a good idea go buy you plane tickets you get real cheap right right but you don't pack your clothes right right do you sat down in front of the airport you get what i'm saying yes if we knew the very moment and that's why brother randall said god kept it that way the word of bride will be watching and waiting he's oh yes if i knew the day no no no no probably be so shitly lazy about it we'd forget today that he said he was coming all right church now let's go on into something now we read here in revelation 8 1 that it says a silence in heaven now you want to write this down and then just use it later on you'll hear it a lot of it doesn't say there's silence on earth there has to be a reason for the silence would you agree that's right yes as i said a moment ago it's not just 30 minutes or 20 years or never how you get it all figured out something had to take place right witness said there was silence something had to go on there okay now we went through the seals coming up we came up to the sixth seal and the prophet of god covers through that that's the earthquake and the thing and he covers a lot of things and says it's the you know the two witnesses come in that period of time and and and all like that but then when he starts on the seventh seal he does an odd thing he doesn't just jump in to tell you what it is you remember in the seals back prior you can't find this i'll help you find it he said i i just talk a while until paraphrasing it until the spirit comes for to to deal with this so when he take the first seal and then he he talked about regarding simplicity until something happened and then he would not and he got into the seventh seal and he begin to talk and he says there's an interval which means a like a space between you know a gap whatever you want to call it between this sixth and seventh seal said we need to cover this because this is all the material we got to go on we'll read that in a second if you notice there was a breach between uh sixth and seventh seal i mean six and seven churches and he preached a message on the uh the throne and the different things you know ten virgins is the message there's always a gap and something has to come in there there was a gap between the old testament and the new right and see john the baptist had to come in and fit exactly into place to be able to carry it across because always in an interval or a gap there's got to be something to go across and like you go down and you look and there's a mountain here in the mountain there and you can't get across what do you do you build a bridge so the bridge is the gap so he preached the message god in simplicity and then he preached a message called the bridge breach and that word breach means that you bring those two together by a bridge in between right you reach over you you get over to the other side all right then there was a breach between the six and seventh seal and uh he said this is all we got to go on talks about the calling out of the 144 000 to dan and ephraim and yes and all of the things missing and then being put back in he said that's all we got to go on now you might not consider a way that i think and i'm glad you don't because we'd all be in trouble with everybody like me i agree with that 100 percent but to me i've got to be able to see something to get across yes if there's a gap i've got to be able to see what gets me across there i'm not just going to stand up there and it'll be foggy down have you ever been above the clouds in an airplane have you ever been above them in out in colorado one time walked out on this plateau and looked at the prettiest mountain right over there and it looked like all i gotta do is walk this snow over there but that wasn't snow it was clouds and you know what would have happened that i stepped out right you see i want to know how to get across there all right now my total dependencies upon whether or not god kept his word right i'll ask you to write that down see how perfect god's word is and whether or not he'd keep that word so he sent us a prophet we agree right yes now brother branham couldn't bridge us across but god through keeping his word to send us a prophet that the word could come to then we'd have the ability to be able to cross these gaps he said john the baptist yes right 200 years to messiah he brought him across he bridged it from the old to you amen see then when you get into the feast of the trumpets brother adam will tell you that between the sixth and seventh seal the messenger of malachi 4 comes okay and that drove people to haywire the one brother said you can't trust what he said there because there's too many mistakes well i don't find any at all because he said it was thus saith the lord i found a lot of my gap mind and you know messed up see you looking and saying and we'll get back to that eventually one of these days and you'll say what brother rather said all the trumpets sound on the sixth seal that's right that's true yeah and if the messenger of malachi 4 comes between the 6th and 7th seal i'd put him in the tribulation that's where our mind goes that's why people say you can't understand what he's talking about i agree we can't if it's not revealed i don't agree with that 100 percent we see they fail to look enough and keep searching to find out brother brown said one day after the seal's broken honey he said all those trumpets sounding on a sixth seal and he said six of them's already sounded so the prophet came between the six and seven trumpet got six of them done sounded see that's where we look at it we try to analyze there and nail it down on one thought instead of listening yes to consider what's being said that's right i believe that we had a prophet to come to bring us a message yes he didn't stand there for me jesus christ amen but he had to use him to tell me about it right right how much greater could it be to honor to a prophet than to believe his work but he says about this and he brings out during the seventh seal to the beginning he brings out those the things of the 144 thousand are taken out of the of danny from the putting back of dan and ephraim and he says go ahead and pull up number one a brother look what he says this is in the seventh seal paragraph 81 now we're going to speak here now on this seventh chapter in just a minute to kind of bridge it in between sixth and seventh seal because that's the only material we have to go on right now is the between the six and seventh seal is the calling out of israel all right so he preaches and brings a great lengthy discourse there or whatever the word is called i don't like our human words he preaches a great message of the taking out of danny from the putting back of dan and ephraim to show us that god said if you go after the models your name is going to be removed from under heaven and danny from was removed from under heaven but when heaven comes back into view in the millennial reign dan and ephraim is put back in that's why i ask you to write down how perfect is god's word and how he keeps his word now to me that's the basis of what he was saying the only thing we got to go on is the calling out of israel to bridge it between the six and seventh seal he said that's all we have to go on what god telling them what it would do and telling them that their name would be blotted out under heaven but it will not be blotted out in heaven under heaven thereby he kept his word amen how perfect a foundation could you lay it down to be able to say what he was going to say and tell us what the seventh seal is that's right what would be more perfect what a thought could you bring to be more perfect than god giving you his word amen and god keeping his word and then you will start dealing with a silence in heaven an interval a space there but now here's the point and i said i'll repeat because we're not to look at the seals to see what he's talking about somebody else that's fine that's wonderful that's like reading the book you get john and mary you know you get what's his name don't run spot run sister julie gave me that one for a christmas present so we're looking for the revelation of not just who these things are talking about but what does it reveal to you and i am remember the six seals are to reveal the plan of redemption the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything it's silence but you'll find out later it can be revealed right in silence the fact of the silences means that if if if it was just the seventh seal open right then why did it just say it that way let's set up still open then just go on it stipulated made a point but there was silence in heaven see mankind has always been waiting the plan of redemption to be completed right is that our desires is that our thoughts to plan a redemption to be completed finished brought into reality made into manifestation revealed and it must be revealed before it can be brought into a reality i go that's the way god does it yes all right see there's a plan of redemption what is it about the plan of redemption that we need to know what would be the end time that we've preached so long on all these years and talked about what would be the thing in the end time that we need to know paul and peter and them preach to plan a redemption they preached the new birth and then we must receive it that's right they preach the statue of a perfect man that brings the individual to a position they preached of adoption they preached to talk about a child coming to adulthood but what is the thing that's always been the mystery that they were not able to bring into reality back there the change of this body that we live in that's right so the plan of redemption is not complete until we see the full redemption um this body and then by this body being redeemed the world is going to have to follow it right so we're waiting the redemption to bring us to a reality and then a world will have to be one day changed so that is the mystery of redemption that we need to know about and that's what the seals reveal we're talking about the fifth seal as to be those that were crucified that were killed from by from calvary down to where we are now that know nothing about jesus christ that's right but yet god is going to give them eternal life yes and to think about how that that plan our redemption would so apply there that you could see justification that in god's eyes you and i didn't do what the things we've done so justified until we can see him giving those people eternal life sanctification under the sixth seal there were people in the world and then all is purged and to realize it must be a people in the end time purged so much until god can step on the scene in our hearts and our lives the plan of redemption knowing that one day this world that we live on will receive such a baptism of the holy ghost until it will burn off all the dessert diseases the germs the life that we call it today and destroy all of the demons and things and to realize the baptism of the holy ghost to you and i should bring that soul to that place towards eternal life living in the soul of mankind by the new birth but still with that new birth with that adoption you talk about but all of those things we don't see the body redeemed you know what i mean we believe it is we talk about it not in the manifestation that's right all right so something has to happen but the prophet of god made the key to it one day he said and we know that he doesn't step here physically until the millennium but he made a statement one day he said god fill every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture well i just don't see that brother dale one i don't either but that got anything to do with it come on does that got anything to do with it because i don't see it that's right that's what people are about to sell it's sealed see they say it's not open well what the heart says not open to me they're not safe not open but the bible says it's open the prophet says it's opened them see they want to say the way i believe it is not open they don't do that they want everybody it's not open to nobody you know what they're saying when it does open i'll tell you right you don't recognize them dot them demons you don't recognize them things standing in front of you call preachers right i'll tell you when it opens okay yeah now brother dale they're not all white i didn't say there was but now listen we're waiting the redemption of the body i'm not concerned about the world being made eternal that's a thousand years plus a short season and went on down and white throne and a whole bunch of things before this world gets eternalized right that's right i'm concerned about the redemption of this body that i'm dwelling in that's right and the older i get the more i'm concerned about it let's just read something here a couple of scriptures i know i'm not going to get done when i want to but go ahead we read hebrews 11 40 a lot but we ever read 39. verse 39 said and all these which means the above which is the old testament saints and the bride of crisis in the ground right right the grave wait and all these haven't obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise now you say but that that promise is only talking about that the old testament saints never came to anything until jesus christ came but you need to read amen they came to their place in faith kill the giants and the bearers in a different place haven't obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise what was the promise god hasn't provided some better thing for us not just the end time bride come on before the bride right that's right my brother dick says about it when when paul was standing there saying that he was saying without me but when he died he was having to say without us right he become one of them right he become one of them good point verse 40 god hadn't provided some better thing for us today without us should not be made perfect perfect complete finished full age all of the words see them they're waiting on us to bring to buy something that will bring together their perfection now going over to romans for the earnest expectation of the creature which is creation which is everybody that's not just world that's everybody that's right right everybody is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god where the creature was made subject to vanity that's natural things all the way not willing to move but by reason of him which subjected the same and hope because the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god all right so it's going to happen for we know that the whole creation growth and prevailed and pained together until now why and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body that word to whip means to understand all right so paul peter and him didn't understand so now you are dealing with the endtime people that's right i emphasized while ago the us to make sure we didn't just well they were waiting waiting on them waiting on us no their connection was waiting on them right but now it's waiting on us we're the only people that can break the price this plan of redemption and to bring a device we must know what it is yes right right now right what the quotes we gave the other day look at 1b which is spoken words original seed paragraph 4 20 4 21. look what harmony jesus never did anything until sin of the father or the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see john 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it he never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death earth deceit is planted it's got to come forth here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ and know what he wants done with the word not sending her where it comes from from him right and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord then it's dramatized but the holy spirit said you now thus saith the lord this says lord by stripes you're healed but if that ain't germanized that's right right we'll do any good right that's right she has it we've got the message we've got thus saith the lord by way of the prophet's message but we need a german diamond they do only his will i mean i believe that no one can persuade them different they don't go after the two souls the seventh on the verge of prove this ever all of those doctrines they have thus saith the lord or they keep stealing because those doctrines are not gonna save the lord then they will do the works of god so much for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill it is not me and you it is him in us amen to fulfill his word what as he did not complete in his day he didn't complete the full word mistake all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet they paid the price before he redeemed us he went through himself death burial resurrection ascension rapture but it wasn't made manifest to anyone else right you went up come back give the new birth all right you see he hasn't finished his work what he's going to do is through her look at the next one this is the church age book or page 172 those that degrade the only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thyself the order they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word now they know that we ought to realize that he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the right she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things and he must now do but he will now fulfill truly bride the work which he left for this specific time what is that to bring about a change of the body right to preach redemption bring the redemption our life's redemption is what what does first corinthians 15 26 say the last enemy that shall be destroyed is what death so when somebody takes a change they're going to be no more death so it'll take place all right all right let me get something here i know i won't be able to finish the message this morning but let me get a point to you that i want you to see you think i'm just repeating and i keep doing it and i do keep doing it because i want you to see it those first four seals has got a symbol written with them one horse red horse black horsepower the fifth seal doesn't have a symbol it is a reality or a statement of these people the sixth seal it doesn't have a symbol right yeah it says earthquake really under the sixth seal it does not even bring into reality the redemption 144 000 reading just to seal itself right so we know that we're dependent upon the prophet to come to tell us the symbols of the seal and we know then by him coming to give us to show us the symbols and then he would have the capability of telling us who it is under that field seal and it always poses with all mankind and he would be able to tell us about the sixth seal and the redemption not even having a symbol to work from but having the fact that the scripture says it he would take that scripture and god would reveal to him what that scripture was see the prophet had to tell us this time amen you agree the prophet had to tell us all the way up to what we're talking about now even got to a place that he now symbols to deal with so we dealt with the word of the lord coming to him right symbols one two three four five six no symbol writing in the scriptures but yet having to be a prophet to know what that's saying right raise it greater than symbols right amen but you got a symbol you got something to look at when you got it coming straight to him and he said i've never saw this before right and he told us what happened on that fifth ceiling that it was took it back into the bible to prove it sit sealed he took it into the bible to see it all right and when he did he gave us his revelation right right right well nobody else didn't have it now we baptist used to read the sixth seal and i've heard him preach about it and say that's a tribulation because you could read it you know the great earthquakes the great thing we didn't know what's going on you know that clark's larkin before brother brown come on the scene first larkin said the white horse rider was the antichrist that didn't mean he understood fully what the word was saying did he just said what he believed because he couldn't prove it because he's probably trinitarian but now we come to the seventh seal and they're silence in heaven charlotte's in heaven going to quote number two i added those one two three four on this abc's from wins when i had their wednesday wednesday preach on me but look at what the prophet said paragraph 241 the four and 20 elders that stood before god they're harping with their hearts you remember where that's at that's in chapter five right four coming up and into five right okay they quit play in their hearts it was angels there they were um 24 elders no revelations four and five angels hustlers singing in heaven think the holy cherubims and serve them now isaiah saw in the temple with six or three sets of wings and over his face and the thing and they walked and said holy holy holy no syrup films pushed up angels quit singing we flying in the presence of god singing holy holy holy they just stop no angels singing no praises no alder service i sound like earth but you gotta remember in heaven don't get the idea nothing ain't taking place on earth why would they stand in all if something would take place somewhere okay this is going to be a little bit ahead of time doesn't mean about the authors here because they know all the services in heaven they're the altars and they just everything in heaven throngs there were silence hushed deadly silence in heaven for half hour all the host of heaven was solid for this half hour with the celestial mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke now why does people keep saying it's not broke i know what he's talking about when he said it's not broke to the public and there will be broke to the public but it's broke the land breaks it you know what they were all done right right i believe they didn't know something they didn't know there it was they just stopped why what is it silence in heaven now silence in heaven the great silence right why would there be such a silence why would he come to a space of about half an hour it could be silence now remember what you're seeing this is in heaven there was silence in heaven but something made them go silent right amen that's what i want to know don't you i want to know why silence would be in heaven let's don't get too over joyous about what's on earth right exactly yet okay because you're going to find out something in a minute that's going to be surprising i guess but there was silence in heaven didn't say this knowledge on earth silence in heaven this seventh seal he's dealing with what happened in heaven whereas the other six seals deals with what takes place on earth time wise etc silence in heaven let's get one more quote and then we'll quit number three paragraph 43 the seventh seal our heavenly father he's praying he said here comes that great night a great hour that when a great thing has happened remember that we'll be back to it he's been all around the people and father i pray that tonight that will be made known be under shadow of a doubt to the people's hearts and minds that they know that god is still on the throne everybody wants him to leave the drama and he still loves his people and it's the hour hour that the world has longed to see the world is long to see is now approaching or it cries out for redemption we see the elements ready to bring it back we see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of christ we can see the the right taking on the form where you're wetting gargano making ready we can see the lights are flickering we know that we're to end the heavenly father as this goes forward now to preach on to teach on this great mighty event that taken place in glory some 2000 years ago and was given to the great beloved apostle john and tonight we're to speak more upon him let the holy spirit come forward now in his mighty power and revolution he might reveal to us that thing which he wants us to know now he says this silence in heaven was a silence on earth and that's what i said everybody's trying to figure out how long 20 years old ain't that something but where do we start with it you know it says silence in heaven he said he gave it to his apostle to bring it to her with cover this afternoon that that's the order he forgot to give it to john john had to give it sent it down to it early on enjoy right but remember this took place in glory 2 000 years ago what happened in glory 2 000 years ago you see now here's where you're gonna go outside and talk and i'd come back and listen this afternoon because i want to make a nice statement there were silence in heaven when all seven seals broke i said it the way i want it to he says just under the seventh seal we'll eventually get bound to knowing what that means but there was silence in heaven when the first seal broke are you thinking with me i'll ask you a question and i wrote down a very serious question did anybody know anything about these seagulls until the prophet came now come on reading it we can see this reading it we could talk about that we bad just could talk about a six seal tribulation but was there anybody that had the mystery of redemption before this prophet came did anybody know what these seals are before the prophet came okay we only make silence in heaven when the seventh seal is broken we'll show this afternoon it run around and said until that seventh seal is broke we're only presuming he knew that the first before he started that's a statement i'm thinking out of the breach because he knew nobody knew what the plan of redemption was it was going to be revealed to him that week he was going to bring it see we only look at one seal and you that heard the seals only years ago know one thing for certain there is not but one seal to be broken in time amen and the holy spirit is that steel amen there is no seal apart from the holy spirit ephesians 4 30. all six seals broke in glory and they're silence and to the world it's still silent to the little bride of christ he's beginning to catch on is he having the first healers on earth well that's what i just said but the silence is in heaven now brother dale are you saying that for 2 000 years it's been solace in heaven well he said this took place 2000 years ago see 2 000 years ago and glory john saw the plan of redemption nobody couldn't see it until now this time take on these things you're just confusing what's confusing you know what's confusing see you got your own idea right and you're not listening to anyone else talk about the word right you got your own idea about what this thing is you take silence in heaven just mentioned high five but a random even gave a quote in his early ministry of that you know what he said he said the reason is silence in heaven for supposed to have an hour he said there's nothing up there the moment you heard that he said there's nothing up there what silence but then when you go away today you remember what i said i remember it this way that first seal was not revealed back there right you begin to come in to a time on the earth that the things could be made manifest yet but no one knew what that white horse rider was until the prophet spoke to revelation so there was silence in heaven for 2 000 years now why don't you calculate your backwards you figure out a height of 30 minutes equals out of 21 years or something like that breaking it down to so much time for this and so much time for that but just remember it said about a day so you goofed up don't you go back the other way you realize 2 000 years on earth it's been about 30 minutes in heaven don't you count that way it's been about 30 minutes up in heaven that's not a long time if you're rejoicing if you're in a state of suspense it's a long time see we have a lot of things that we can cover on the seventh seal that where the prophet will call it those seven thunders you call it the coming of the lord but yet we say we don't know what it is we can say what he said and the only way you're going to know what the first seal is is to say what he said right see doing away totally with her own concepts but i get right to think that's what brought us into this situation we're in that's what brought death with this thinking so we keep on thinking we're going to keep on dying and you and i ain't got much time a lot of us ain't got much time to afford to lose you know it nigga's aunt died the other day burying her today he was 97 years old there's people now 100 years old but you know what there's a lot of people dead at 16. so we don't have no time to fool around church when are we going to get down go ahead 161 inspirable 161 anybody have a need anybody have a name you know that's one of the things that's like her sister was saying about pain see the pain that i've been through makes me able to sympathize is
