[1:44] and we'll try to continue our thought
[1:47] from this morning and go to john 6
[1:50] beginning in verse 53

[1:58] thank you for being you

[2:27] stand complete in you
[2:29] and just have your way bless those that

[2:36] week lord and
[2:38] just have your way with each and every
[2:39] one of us
[2:40] and lord open the eyes of our hearts
[2:44] that we may see you
[2:45] in jesus name amen
[2:48] all right
[2:50] john
[2:52] 6 53.
[2:56] now you know the story of this this is
[2:57] coming down and
[2:59] the point i'll get to in a little while
[3:00] while you'll see what i'm reading it
[3:03] reading this that jesus coming down
[3:05] talking about i'm the bread that come
[3:07] down from heaven you know in the
[3:09] different things and then just to save
[3:10] reading we'll drop to verse 53
[3:15] because you know they had said how can
[3:16] we eat this man's flesh how can we do
[3:18] this or whatever
[3:20] then said jesus unto them verily verily
[3:22] i say unto you
[3:24] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[3:26] man and drink his blood you have no life
[3:28] in you
[3:29] who eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[3:31] blood hath
[3:33] eternal life
[3:36] and i will raise him up at the last days
[3:38] now remember my point is he will not
[3:41] explain what he's talking about all
[3:43] right
[3:44] all right you get to sit and he doesn't
[3:46] explain what he's talking about
[3:49] see there's a reason for it all right
[3:53] for my flesh it's meat indeed and my
[3:55] blood is drink indeed
[3:57] he doesn't eat uf my flesh and drink of
[3:59] my blood dwelleth in me
[4:01] and i in him
[4:02] as a living father hath sent me and i
[4:04] live by the by the father so
[4:07] he that eateth me even he shall live by
[4:10] me
[4:11] this is that bread which came down from
[4:13] heaven
[4:14] not as your fathers did eat manna and
[4:16] are dead
[4:18] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[4:20] forever
[4:21] these things said he in the synagogue as
[4:24] he taught in capernaum
[4:26] many there are four of his disciples
[4:28] when they had heard this
[4:30] said this is a hard saying who can hear
[4:32] it
[4:33] when jesus knew in himself that his
[4:35] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[4:37] them
[4:39] this this offends you in other words
[4:41] you've got problems over what i've just
[4:42] said let me say something else right
[4:46] what and if you shall see the son of man
[4:49] ascend up where he was before
[4:53] is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[4:56] prophetess nothing the words i speak to
[4:58] unto you they are spirit in their life
[5:01] but there are some of you that believe
[5:03] not
[5:04] for jesus knew from the beginning who
[5:06] they were that believe not and should
[5:08] betray him and he said therefore
[5:12] and he said therefore said i unto you
[5:15] that no man can give can come unto me
[5:17] except it was
[5:19] were given unto him of my father
[5:22] from that time many of his disciples
[5:24] went back and walked no more with him
[5:26] don't worry about it
[5:28] he didn't explain it
[5:30] then said jesus unto the dwell
[5:33] will you also go away
[5:35] brother randomly says it's like this
[5:37] said do you wish to go also
[5:39] that's what he said that they were what
[5:41] was actually being said
[5:43] then simon peter answered him lord to
[5:46] whom shall we go
[5:48] thou hast the words of eternal life
[5:50] and we believe and are sure that the art
[5:53] that christ the son of the living god
[5:57] now
[5:59] think about what's being said
[6:02] and we believe and are sure
[6:04] that our that christ the son of the
[6:06] living god you may be seated the lord
[6:08] that is blessing to the reading of the
[6:10] word
[6:11] now
[6:14] my whole point of reading that scripture
[6:16] is one thing
[6:20] god loves to test your faith
[6:24] we'll get to that in a little bit
[6:26] he loves to test your faith
[6:29] he loves to test to see whether or not
[6:31] you have the faith
[6:35] and you know it wasn't long after that
[6:37] they doing you know the 70 we know left
[6:42] and then he turns to the 12 and said why
[6:44] don't you go two you know if you want to
[6:48] he didn't explain it
[6:51] he was testing them to see what they
[6:53] would do
[6:54] all right
[6:57] and they said well we believe
[7:00] but then later on in putting more
[7:02] scriptures together and coming up jesus
[7:04] said do you now believe
[7:08] in other words has it come to a place
[7:09] that you could finally believe
[7:12] then he comes to a place that he says
[7:15] when the son of man cometh
[7:19] said will he find faith in the earth
[7:22] you know
[7:24] all right that's
[7:25] coming all the way down to where you and
[7:28] i are at all right
[7:30] coming of the son of man
[7:33] god loves to test our faith
[7:37] but is it testing our faith to see
[7:40] for him to see what we'll do
[7:45] or for us to find out
[7:48] what we'll do
[7:51] did he test job
[7:53] to find out what job would do or to let
[7:56] job through that testing
[7:58] receive
[8:00] strength and
[8:02] doings because only through his testings
[8:05] and
[8:06] and the things that happened did job
[8:09] come to a place that he said i know my
[8:12] redeemer liveth
[8:14] it was not in the beginning it was not
[8:15] in the starting it was
[8:17] when he finally come down to
[8:19] you know appoint something personal to
[8:22] him
[8:24] all right
[8:25] and see god even will give us something
[8:30] right
[8:31] but then he'll test us
[8:33] to see what we think about it
[8:36] he'll show you something in the word he
[8:38] has me
[8:40] but yet not explain it
[8:44] you know
[8:45] not explain it to me
[8:49] but he'd give me a time
[8:51] and give me a point that i could
[8:54] sit down and thinks things out
[8:57] and
[8:58] you know
[8:59] he loves to do that
[9:02] because he knows what we'll do
[9:06] you could say you mean god would would
[9:09] deliberately put something in front of
[9:11] you
[9:13] to try you
[9:14] that's what he says in the scripture
[9:16] there
[9:18] you know
[9:19] the can't come one problem word on
[9:21] i sent it among you what to test you
[9:25] to try you
[9:27] to see if you're staying
[9:30] but you said well well god don't look
[9:33] like that would be right for god
[9:35] remember you're not dealing with an
[9:37] ignorant peanut brain people
[9:41] you know a person
[9:44] you're dealing with god
[9:48] god was here he knew
[9:51] that if he said anything about being the
[9:53] bread they wouldn't understand it he
[9:56] knew if he said what he did about the uh
[9:59] the blood
[10:01] they wouldn't understand it
[10:06] but then you all showed that if he spent
[10:07] 20 years explaining it
[10:10] they still wouldn't understand it
[10:14] it's not god
[10:15] uh doing something to try to trick or
[10:19] whatever
[10:22] he knows whether or not you and i
[10:25] will ever come to the place
[10:27] of having rapturing faith
[10:32] uh you know faith for healing
[10:35] oh
[10:36] he knows
[10:37] he didn't you hear the 70 would walk
[10:40] away
[10:42] he knew the 12 would stay and he knew
[10:44] one of them would be the one that would
[10:47] betray you
[10:49] god loves to test your faith
[10:52] you know
[10:54] you never heard brother brown say that
[10:56] god would speak to him about something
[10:58] he said i'll spend the rest of the day
[11:00] searching through the bible
[11:03] to see whether that was right or not
[11:08] he loves to do that
[11:10] well because that is our child training
[11:14] if he put us in a tube pushed us through
[11:17] the other side
[11:19] he said there's no overcoming to that
[11:21] so he tests you
[11:23] he's going to test the little bride
[11:25] in the end time look down to end of the
[11:28] message to her
[11:29] to worthy he says it
[11:31] he'll prove to satan that this bride
[11:34] won't fall like eve
[11:38] now
[11:40] he loves to test you and i
[11:44] and let us come out of it
[11:49] with faith builder
[11:51] all right
[11:53] now what have we been talking about
[11:56] so if he loves to test us then wouldn't
[11:58] our whole life
[12:01] you know a christian journey
[12:03] uh true justification in the same case
[12:05] and baptism in the holy ghost and coming
[12:07] on up
[12:08] wouldn't he be
[12:09] wouldn't he love to test us all the way
[12:11] through
[12:15] and wouldn't it be something that even
[12:16] when you first come to god
[12:21] that you first
[12:22] repent what happens
[12:26] he turned everybody against you
[12:29] like right in hopes said
[12:31] he said when he got saved said he
[12:33] thought everybody called the life he'd
[12:35] been you know he said i thought
[12:37] everybody would would want to know that
[12:40] i got saved
[12:41] he said i went around the neighborhood
[12:43] telling them he said you know they
[12:45] weren't too happy about it
[12:50] well think about it now
[12:55] then even through our mental faith
[12:59] you know
[13:01] you remember
[13:03] blasphemous names the biggest portion of
[13:06] our faith is mental
[13:09] based upon what
[13:12] the word of god
[13:16] what
[13:18] but it's a mental faith
[13:21] he starts off revealing himself
[13:25] and what happened when you started when
[13:27] you first heard
[13:29] the truth
[13:31] oh that's where people do it when they
[13:33] do it but
[13:34] i'm sorry i just remember too much but
[13:37] you know people say well when i first
[13:39] saw that when i see it i've seen it i've
[13:41] seen it
[13:44] but then you remember well why'd it take
[13:46] me six months to be able to beat it into
[13:48] you you know
[13:50] but see he'll try you
[13:54] you go out to the world and start
[13:56] talking about being a christian
[14:00] they're going to try to get you to go to
[14:01] the honky tonk they're going to try to
[14:03] get you to go smoke a cigarette they're
[14:05] going to try to get you to go drink it
[14:06] they're going to try to get you to do
[14:07] everything
[14:09] and they really become your enemy
[14:11] right
[14:14] he allows that to happen
[14:18] to see whether or not
[14:20] that you will stand for him even with
[14:22] just a mental concept
[14:28] so not only did he allow the world and
[14:30] everything to go against the disciples
[14:33] he seemingly
[14:34] looked like he was going against him
[14:36] himself
[14:40] saying
[14:41] you're going to eat my flesh drink my
[14:43] blood if you don't
[14:45] you won't have no part with me
[14:48] that's something ain't it
[14:51] but see done it to test them
[14:54] and remember now the disciples was in
[14:56] the form of mental faith
[14:59] when he was talking to them
[15:01] all right
[15:04] because they were not born again
[15:06] all right
[15:08] on the message perfect faith i just
[15:11] pulled this out
[15:12] so go ahead brother john put it up 1a
[15:17] when i said i wish you'd listen to that
[15:18] message but look what he's saying
[15:21] now now we see at first the disciples
[15:25] didn't have this perfect faith
[15:28] they didn't have it
[15:30] because they'd had christ walking with
[15:33] them
[15:35] all right
[15:36] but then afterwards christ was in them
[15:39] so you see it's hard then to have
[15:41] perfect faith
[15:42] without the holy spirit
[15:44] it has to bring it
[15:46] the disciples you say your disciple
[15:48] didn't have perfect no they remember the
[15:50] child and they couldn't cast it out
[15:54] he allowed them to
[15:56] come up against a lot of things
[15:59] and then rebuking them for their lack of
[16:02] faith
[16:04] well
[16:05] could it be that you and i
[16:09] could be at that point
[16:12] because remember now this is before they
[16:14] receive the holy ghost
[16:17] but then go into their lives after they
[16:19] receive the holy ghost
[16:24] and look
[16:27] john was the only one
[16:29] that died a natural death
[16:33] all of the rest of the apostles you know
[16:36] the disciples
[16:38] all were killed for what they believed
[16:42] looked like when the holy ghost come he
[16:44] would have just put them apart and when
[16:46] they let nothing touch them
[16:49] look at paul
[16:52] beat four or five times one striped shy
[16:55] of death
[16:56] in the deep
[16:59] and he said in trouble with my own
[17:00] brother
[17:04] gonna let him be tried amen
[17:07] he lets you and i be tried to see
[17:09] let us find out
[17:12] if what we have is genuine
[17:18] now
[17:20] i've always said the reason he puts you
[17:22] here is
[17:23] like in the army if they wanted a tough
[17:25] bunch of groups
[17:26] they didn't pick out the little
[17:28] you know
[17:30] feminist acting
[17:32] charge ups and put them over and they
[17:33] got the roughest toughest meanest
[17:35] hatefulest guy they could get
[17:37] and put him over them told to go beat
[17:38] the daylights out of me make something
[17:40] out of him
[17:41] well that's the way god does here i
[17:43] guess but he sent you here for us to
[17:45] holler and scream enough at
[17:48] but yet it's to test us
[17:51] to see whether or not we'll walk with
[17:53] the truth
[17:55] and then that way it's not somebody walk
[17:57] up to you and say
[18:00] what do you think well brother so-and-so
[18:03] believes this
[18:05] you know he's got seniority in the
[18:07] message
[18:08] you know
[18:09] he walked with the prophet he talked
[18:11] with him
[18:12] the prophet ordained him in the ministry
[18:14] they said the other
[18:16] you
[18:18] well i can sort of go believe him
[18:23] if you don't get nothing else out of the
[18:24] message today get one thing
[18:27] god loves to test you
[18:31] he loves to try you
[18:33] not to find out what you'll do
[18:36] he knows what you'll do
[18:38] he wants you to know what you'll do
[18:41] he wants you to know your limits
[18:44] and your abilities
[18:47] they say they have i've read
[18:49] not too long ago about
[18:51] in the military now they have a
[18:53] group of military
[18:54] elite
[18:56] that can just run for 24 hours a day
[18:59] it's just on
[19:01] the article it was just totally
[19:03] unbelievable
[19:05] the human
[19:07] the things those human beings could do
[19:12] because they were so
[19:13] trained
[19:14] built
[19:15] you know tested put forth
[19:20] but it's like i told you to
[19:22] the way it looks around the country i'd
[19:24] sure hate for us to have to go fight a
[19:25] war that was required
[19:28] now because
[19:31] we'll
[19:34] you know
[19:38] wouldn't be something
[19:40] require these soldiers go out there now
[19:42] when they can't even
[19:44] exist
[19:45] you know
[19:46] tell them to go climb a tree and they
[19:47] couldn't even get up it
[19:50] but listen church
[19:52] my whole point
[19:54] god loves to try us
[19:58] because in the trial
[20:01] we will find out
[20:03] whether or not
[20:05] that our mental faith
[20:08] has become a spiritual revelation
[20:13] because if it stands the test
[20:16] then we'll know
[20:18] right our faith not his
[20:25] if it stands a test when the everybody
[20:27] can be against you
[20:29] and that's what a lot of people don't
[20:31] believe that that there's going to be
[20:32] any form of of persecution for the bride
[20:38] because they say well no you know no god
[20:40] loves us so much he's not going to let
[20:42] things happen
[20:45] well he did before
[20:47] are you something special
[20:50] when he had 68 million killed
[20:53] you know allowed that to happen
[20:56] to see whether or not they would stay
[20:58] with the word
[21:02] and then we think we're going to get by
[21:04] on a flowery bed of ease
[21:07] you better go reading
[21:10] but now think about it
[21:15] it's hard for you and i
[21:18] to
[21:20] comprehend
[21:23] i guess the way or i don't know how to
[21:25] say that i wrote down the best i could
[21:27] it's hard for us to understand
[21:29] the working of god the way he does
[21:33] because we get it figured out
[21:36] and we're dodio granddaddies you know
[21:39] and grandkids they just can't do nothing
[21:41] wrong
[21:42] you know i mean they just they just
[21:47] grandkids get on the bed and jump up and
[21:48] down well i have one of our kids that
[21:50] have done that
[21:53] they wouldn't have been sitting down for
[21:55] a while
[21:56] because they would have been sore
[21:58] but you know i mean that's just the way
[22:00] we are we get old and
[22:03] but do we think that's the way god is
[22:07] remember god don't have no grandchildren
[22:10] amen
[22:11] he has sons and daughters
[22:13] that have been tried
[22:16] and tested
[22:18] and how can you prove what you are
[22:22] if you ain't never had a test
[22:25] that's what i heard the first come into
[22:26] the message
[22:28] well i'll be glad when i can just speak
[22:29] that word
[22:32] i'll just speak that word and just
[22:34] create
[22:37] well
[22:40] i believe a time will come
[22:42] and i believe it's already here
[22:45] about to speak another word right
[22:48] but you got to have some child training
[22:50] to be able to learn how to use it
[22:52] we say we don't put a child driving a
[22:54] car at five years old
[22:57] no
[22:58] you don't even do it at 15.
[23:01] even the law says you gotta ride with
[23:03] them for a year
[23:06] right child training
[23:10] but we don't want child training
[23:11] especially when it's rough
[23:15] right
[23:16] when it's horrible sometimes
[23:19] the situations of life but just remember
[23:24] you got a 20-foot hurdle you got to get
[23:26] over it
[23:27] a reason to get over the 20-foot hurdle
[23:29] you got a 30-foot hurdle coming sometime
[23:33] right
[23:34] horrible things we better be ready
[23:37] all right
[23:39] now
[23:42] with that thought in mind let's think
[23:43] about something
[23:47] we talked about
[23:49] we must we must first have mental faith
[23:54] before it can become a spiritual
[23:56] revelation
[23:58] all right
[23:59] but if we stop on the mental faith
[24:03] before it is revealed
[24:06] what's happened to us
[24:09] we're like i said this morning about
[24:11] disciples that some of them said hey
[24:14] let's take it by faith
[24:17] we'll go
[24:19] well what's the difference in that than
[24:21] any other church any other system any
[24:24] other groups
[24:27] now
[24:28] we have to admit one thing for sure the
[24:32] biggest portion of the religious world
[24:34] system does not have the new birth would
[24:37] you agree with that
[24:38] i didn't mean and it's got no numbers
[24:40] trying to make no people and no but the
[24:42] biggest portion of the religious society
[24:44] does not have the new birth right
[24:47] well then that means the biggest portion
[24:49] of religious society has a mental
[24:51] concept
[24:53] well what's the difference in our mental
[24:55] concept and other people's mental
[24:57] concept
[25:00] we believe in one god what a baptism and
[25:03] there's a lot of churches that preach
[25:04] about one god and preach about water
[25:07] baptism and
[25:09] right
[25:11] what's the difference between us and
[25:13] others
[25:17] do we want to make ourselves some part
[25:18] but what's the difference between us
[25:21] you know
[25:23] as i always say about
[25:24] you know i respect doctors i respect
[25:27] people's authority they went to school
[25:29] but you know what they put their pants
[25:31] on just like i do
[25:35] they're no different they're just human
[25:37] beings that have dedicated their life
[25:38] and i appreciate them for that
[25:42] but they don't make them no different
[25:44] just because you and i say we are
[25:46] message believers
[25:49] does that make us a special class of
[25:52] people or a group
[25:58] does god look at us at any different
[26:03] or does he look at us as to what we
[26:06] stand for in the word
[26:10] how we believe the word
[26:13] and what the word says
[26:16] like i said this morning why is it then
[26:18] as you see people that that they
[26:20] backslide the first thing they do they
[26:22] start cutting their hair wearing pants
[26:23] and men doing this and why the things
[26:26] that the bible says don't do
[26:29] why
[26:31] and then after a while they come back
[26:33] and say i just backflip what you're
[26:35] saying oh you lost
[26:38] you've lost or you wouldn't have done
[26:39] that
[26:42] and god lets those obstacles get in our
[26:45] way
[26:48] you know
[26:50] look at what's happening now around them
[26:52] the message people
[26:55] i mean you think 40 years ago they would
[26:58] have said very much about
[26:59] brother branham being wrong
[27:04] no
[27:07] see now there's a test
[27:09] here
[27:11] to see whether or not you and i
[27:13] will stay with the word
[27:17] even though
[27:19] they have some good
[27:21] uh evidences of a lot of things
[27:27] but are you going to stand on the
[27:28] personal experience or a collective form
[27:39] see
[27:40] do we have a revelation
[27:43] just because we can read
[27:49] now you wouldn't go that way at all
[27:50] would you
[27:52] the ability to read is a revelation
[27:56] that's not a revelation
[27:58] the ability to read
[28:03] anybody can read
[28:05] you know what i mean with the education
[28:07] abilities et cetera
[28:08] they can read
[28:10] all right
[28:12] with november at brother dale we've got
[28:14] the message you don't understand is it
[28:16] because we have the message within our
[28:18] possession
[28:20] does that mean we're born again
[28:25] because i can let you take my bible
[28:28] and just about explain every doctrine
[28:31] in the message
[28:33] by hand written on the side where the
[28:35] prophet explained that
[28:38] does that mean that i'm born again
[28:44] if it is the computer's got ahead of us
[28:49] remember now all churches
[28:52] now listen to my point
[28:55] basically all churches
[28:57] read
[28:59] from the same basis of the word of god
[29:02] some of them have their own
[29:04] written things you know
[29:06] job witness with their own translation
[29:08] etc but it's still word-based
[29:13] all right
[29:15] when the prophet came did he change
[29:18] the
[29:20] letter of the word
[29:22] to say that wasn't correct
[29:27] no he told us it was correct
[29:33] what did you say
[29:34] well look at our the prophet said it was
[29:36] correct
[29:38] and we believe the lord himself shall
[29:39] descend from heaven with a whoa glory
[29:42] big shout
[29:45] there'll be a trumpet sound there'll be
[29:47] this that and the other be angels
[29:51] well that wasn't what he said to start
[29:52] with
[29:56] if we're talking about last night what
[29:57] would it be
[29:59] what did paul see when he said the lord
[30:01] himself shall descend wait and then
[30:03] we're talking about it
[30:06] paul looked down and seen
[30:09] a seventh church age messenger coming
[30:11] with the word of god
[30:13] and said it was the shout
[30:16] that's what he was saying
[30:19] we had that all twisted in every form
[30:22] see the prophet never changed the letter
[30:24] of the word
[30:26] amen
[30:28] he told us the letter of the word was
[30:30] correct
[30:32] but he never told us that because we
[30:35] could now have the
[30:37] correct form of saying the word is right
[30:41] but that meant it was revealed
[30:45] he said we need revelation more than
[30:47] anything
[30:52] he said yeah but
[30:55] you know we have the revealed word
[31:01] where's it at
[31:02] amen
[31:07] what do you mean brother today we have
[31:09] the message
[31:10] we look at all of the twists and the
[31:13] doctrines and the ideas and opinions
[31:17] of the people of this message
[31:20] is the message that confused
[31:25] does it teach two lords two souls
[31:28] sympathetic virtues parousias
[31:31] river jordans
[31:34] did it does it teach those things
[31:37] you know that even the denominations
[31:40] you don't find them as mixed up
[31:43] in the word letter
[31:45] as the people of this message
[31:49] they may differ without the shout or the
[31:51] little time but they'll hang with the
[31:53] same principle
[31:55] or the people of this message you've got
[31:57] to pull it this way that way
[32:00] right
[32:06] do we have spiritual revelation
[32:09] or is it mental faith
[32:16] remember spiritual revelation will hold
[32:18] us
[32:22] mental faith is like brother whitney you
[32:24] say you get them in with a hot dog you
[32:26] can get them out with a hamburger
[32:28] right
[32:30] you can take them from two souls the
[32:32] seventh other verse of the perusal
[32:34] you know two lords and
[32:36] and all you can just move people from
[32:38] one doctrine to another
[32:43] but is the message that confused
[32:48] did he teach that what they say he did
[32:52] you know
[32:58] now
[33:01] think about it
[33:06] how do we know
[33:08] that we have substance faith
[33:12] i know it's kind of sleepy a little bit
[33:14] today so ayahuaya jump up and down
[33:16] scream and holler do something
[33:19] you'll scare the rest of them they'll
[33:20] wake up
[33:24] i understand that
[33:27] but how do you know you have substance
[33:29] faith
[33:37] the two soul people say that the two
[33:38] lords people are wrong
[33:43] the seventh under virtue people says the
[33:45] rest of them's wrong
[33:48] come on you remember what i'm saying you
[33:50] know brother battle says the baptist
[33:52] says the methodist is wrong they all got
[33:54] to be you know well we just moved on up
[33:56] into the little closer you know
[33:58] we just talk about two lords seven
[34:00] thunders instead of saying methodists
[34:02] and baptists and things and we ought to
[34:03] be away from that well by by what
[34:07] standard are thought
[34:10] now you don't get nothing today get this
[34:12] point
[34:13] by what standard thought or whatever you
[34:15] want to call it
[34:17] what is
[34:18] your answer to the question
[34:24] of how do you know whether you have
[34:25] mental faith
[34:27] or spiritual revelation
[34:31] when people with mental faith can walk
[34:34] on coals of fire
[34:36] people with mental faith can levitate
[34:39] tables
[34:41] people with mental faith can bust ice
[34:44] do things that look supernatural
[34:49] by what
[34:51] standard
[34:54] talk or what is it
[34:56] that you put it on
[35:02] we talked about what the prophet said
[35:03] about peter
[35:07] what was the difference in peter
[35:11] when he had the substance
[35:13] and when he didn't have the substance
[35:18] what was the difference in him
[35:23] he first had the substance right
[35:25] he walked on the water
[35:27] he lost his substance kept his
[35:28] confession you remember that over and
[35:30] over been bringing it down
[35:32] what was he doing
[35:34] so he lost his substance faith
[35:38] but he was back to his mental faith
[35:42] because he was at his mental faith
[35:46] when all of them looked and said are you
[35:48] a spook
[35:49] is that this or what is it you know
[35:52] he was in the crowd thinking it was
[35:54] scared and thinking it was much a spook
[35:56] or something out there
[35:59] but then all at once he received
[36:00] something
[36:02] there was a substance that he could walk
[36:04] on
[36:06] but then he lost that substance
[36:11] yet he had his confession
[36:14] all right
[36:16] so the difference in
[36:19] substance faith
[36:21] and mental faith
[36:23] is peter could walk on substance faith
[36:27] are you with me
[36:29] whereas he couldn't walk on mental faith
[36:32] okay is that sensible now that the whole
[36:36] thing we're talking about
[36:40] if you and i let
[36:41] circumstances
[36:45] make us doubt
[36:50] are you listening
[36:54] we let subs if we let circumstances
[36:57] make us doubt
[36:59] then it could be
[37:01] we don't have substance faith
[37:06] and you know what i talk about and how
[37:08] it i am and
[37:09] we're all human you have somebody comes
[37:12] up the doctor says you got cancer
[37:14] what's the first thing
[37:16] my stripes i'm healed
[37:18] you can't tell me i ain't healed i'm
[37:20] healed
[37:25] and they do pretty good for a while
[37:27] until things starts getting worse
[37:31] all right
[37:33] and things starts getting worse
[37:35] you see them gradually losing that
[37:39] great
[37:41] first
[37:43] unction or whatever you want to call it
[37:46] and they begin to
[37:48] well i need to go to the doctor i guess
[37:51] brother brown said it's okay to go to
[37:53] the doctor now didn't he say that
[37:56] you read it this morning it was okay to
[37:58] go doctor
[38:01] and maybe they can take me and find some
[38:04] cure
[38:05] with my case
[38:10] see you've lost your substance
[38:14] but you have your mental faith it's his
[38:16] vice rights i'm healed
[38:20] the circumstances
[38:22] has made us doubt
[38:30] then you can see how it would be easy to
[38:34] go from one
[38:35] doctrine
[38:37] in the message
[38:39] to another doctrine
[38:43] because
[38:44] of the ability to out-argue
[38:50] and i've warned you a long time ago
[38:53] about 40-something years ago
[38:58] i said it then and i still believe it
[39:01] when a move comes among this bride and
[39:03] things starts taking place there's going
[39:05] to be a move in them denominational
[39:08] churches
[39:10] and when it comes into the real bride to
[39:13] move the seventh under virtue people
[39:15] proves his son of man
[39:17] two souls
[39:19] signs and wonders are gonna start
[39:20] happening
[39:25] now what are you gonna do
[39:28] now you've experienced it
[39:32] you know when the
[39:34] they're not named the names dude not
[39:36] because you don't need but you know when
[39:38] the young ones jump up in this message
[39:40] young preachers
[39:42] and they'll get a following
[39:45] oh this is it this is it
[39:50] and after a while it just
[39:53] dwindles
[39:54] down here comes another one well this is
[39:58] it
[39:59] yeah
[40:03] you know that's true
[40:05] you've been around long enough to see
[40:08] all right
[40:10] but what if somebody come along with
[40:12] great signs and wonders
[40:17] what are you going to do
[40:20] what are you going to do if somebody
[40:21] come in here
[40:22] i said i challenge your faith
[40:25] we're going to have a dead person
[40:26] rolling here
[40:28] and god is going to raise them from the
[40:30] dead
[40:34] but i'm going to tell you brother
[40:35] branham's message is wrong
[40:39] and to prove i'm right the dead is going
[40:41] to raise what are you going to do if the
[40:43] dead raises
[40:49] but you better remember one thing too
[40:51] keep it in your mind the devil can't
[40:53] raise the dead
[40:56] so god is going to test the people
[41:00] well it's not that what it says in the
[41:02] scripture or the prophet gave you a sign
[41:05] and it come to pass
[41:07] read your bible
[41:10] see buddy take you to another god
[41:12] says because i
[41:14] done that to try you
[41:18] what are you going to do
[41:23] this is not a play thing
[41:27] it's either life or death
[41:32] now so then you can have a substance
[41:37] faith
[41:40] and then lose it
[41:42] but now i always have to go through to
[41:45] explain myself because
[41:47] people get lost in you
[41:48] you can't have a born-again
[41:52] experience of the baptism of the holy
[41:53] ghost like come on the day of pentecost
[41:56] and lose it
[41:59] yeah so we're not talking about that
[42:00] right that's out of the question that
[42:02] ain't even mentioned
[42:04] they shouldn't even be in your mind
[42:06] because you can't do it
[42:09] you can't be saved today and lost
[42:11] tomorrow
[42:12] now you can be justified as wade was
[42:13] explaining wednesday you can be up part
[42:16] of justification sanctification
[42:20] great follower
[42:22] and miss it and lose it
[42:26] why because
[42:28] you don't have the substance
[42:32] you think you do
[42:35] it looks like you do
[42:37] you act like you do
[42:39] but you don't have it
[42:41] we need somebody to jog us
[42:44] we've been a while now without a new
[42:46] doctrine
[42:51] we need somebody to come along and jog
[42:53] us
[42:57] you think i'm a hateful old dude
[42:59] but i have thought about
[43:01] coming out here and trying to preach
[43:03] something just preach it totally wrong
[43:06] and see how many of you would aim in it
[43:09] and then tell you it's wrong
[43:13] he said well you're not do that i won't
[43:18] have enough trouble trying to keep all
[43:20] the rest of it straight
[43:22] without deliberately doing something
[43:26] remember a brother did years ago though
[43:27] he memorized the tape
[43:30] this happened way back
[43:32] he memorized the tape
[43:35] and he got up and he quoted that tape
[43:38] verbatim
[43:42] and he asked the people whether they
[43:44] believed it or not
[43:48] and it was a verbatim type for brother
[43:50] branham
[43:52] i feel like the old story what you take
[43:54] the constitution out and try to get
[43:56] people to sign it they won't sign it
[43:59] right
[44:02] you know he said well this is the
[44:03] constitution i ain't gonna sign it
[44:08] first of all we don't know what he says
[44:12] what are you following me now
[44:14] we're not talking about
[44:16] having a new birth and losing it
[44:18] because that does not work
[44:20] we're talking about
[44:22] in our journey of justification and
[44:25] sanctification
[44:27] is where the problem is at
[44:30] because in that journey the unclean
[44:32] spirit goes out
[44:34] we get new desires
[44:37] all kind of things are happening
[44:39] we love to go to church
[44:41] we do all of those things
[44:43] and we're still not born again
[44:49] i didn't love to go to church no more
[44:51] the day after i received the holy ghost
[44:53] than i did the day before
[44:57] did you
[45:01] no
[45:03] it didn't work in that way
[45:05] i believe you can repent be baptized
[45:07] follow on
[45:10] i also believe other things i wish i
[45:12] didn't believe
[45:14] uh people will say you need to preach on
[45:16] the new birth you need to preach on
[45:17] justification you need to preach on
[45:19] faith and i start preaching hope and i
[45:21] start laying out
[45:27] it sounds about like his brother he said
[45:29] i can sit for five hours and wailed
[45:32] and wailed and wailed
[45:33] but it wires me out to set an hour
[45:36] in church
[45:39] well that means which one you love the
[45:40] most
[45:42] all right
[45:44] but you know what i mean you know what i
[45:46] love people and don't want to hinder
[45:50] but if you think i ain't right go back
[45:52] to what i said
[45:53] god loves to test you
[45:56] you say with your own
[45:58] mouth i'm going to be in church every
[46:02] service
[46:04] you've just opened up a can of beans
[46:06] that the devil is going to get on your
[46:07] back and you're going to have a good
[46:09] excuse to miss the next service
[46:12] right yeah
[46:16] but when are we going to make that
[46:17] statement and
[46:18] mean it
[46:21] right
[46:22] we want to throw off on the women we
[46:24] want to say
[46:25] that you know
[46:28] you know brother they'll just go on
[46:30] preaching
[46:32] they're gonna do what they're gonna do
[46:33] anyway
[46:34] see there's a difference between
[46:36] mental faith
[46:39] and holy ghost faith
[46:47] the disciples had mental faith
[46:52] and could not
[46:54] heal that child
[46:59] was it something
[47:01] was that disease some disease that was
[47:04] so horrible that they couldn't do
[47:06] remember these fellows had
[47:08] been instrumental in that dead being
[47:10] raised
[47:12] the sick being healed
[47:14] or was it just one time that god
[47:16] said i'm going to let you see you ain't
[47:18] got what you think
[47:21] right
[47:23] and they couldn't cast that demon out of
[47:25] that epileptic child
[47:33] see there's a difference between a
[47:35] mental faith
[47:38] but the prophet said on black feminist
[47:40] names
[47:42] program 143 going through
[47:45] he said
[47:46] when your mental faith
[47:48] becomes a spiritual revelation
[47:56] see when jesus said the gates of hell
[47:59] shall not prevail against
[48:02] the church
[48:04] he was not talking about a mental
[48:08] faith
[48:11] because the gates of hell
[48:13] has already captured mental faith
[48:18] he was speaking of a holy ghost-filled
[48:20] group of people
[48:23] that satan would not be able to stop him
[48:28] a lot of difference in mental faith
[48:31] and a spiritual revelation
[48:37] substance faith
[48:39] does not come first
[48:44] mental faith
[48:46] comes first and then our mental faith
[48:50] when it's quickened becomes a spiritual
[48:52] revelation
[48:54] all right so we need a revelation more
[48:56] than anything
[49:00] what i think is wrong with most people
[49:03] today who follow the message
[49:06] we we ain't out there i'm preaching on
[49:09] the internet they're listening it's up
[49:11] to them i'm preaching lulu
[49:15] we start out like peter
[49:20] with a faith
[49:24] to walk before god
[49:29] at least we start with a positive
[49:31] attitude
[49:32] all right back to our sermon
[49:35] you know a positive attitude comes by
[49:37] accepting the word
[49:42] right
[49:44] you see we start out
[49:47] and we're doing great
[49:51] but one is god's worst enemy
[49:54] sight
[49:55] and time
[49:56] progress 78 demonology
[50:00] excited time
[50:02] god's worst enemy
[50:04] we prayed for it don't happen
[50:08] but yet he's testing us
[50:11] here's what brother brown said he said
[50:13] if you have repented
[50:15] talk about healing you've repented
[50:18] you've confessed everything you've
[50:20] straightened up everything you've done
[50:21] all you know and said you're not healed
[50:23] you know what he said he said god's
[50:25] trying you
[50:29] he said right then is when you need to
[50:30] hold on
[50:32] he's testing you
[50:35] you don't want no group of people
[50:37] when you get down to jordan and the
[50:39] crossing over to be a little cystified
[50:44] he wanted somebody strong
[50:47] to work
[50:48] like in world war ii it was written
[50:50] specimen
[50:52] that sometimes one man
[50:54] would determine whether or not they
[50:57] defeated the enemy
[51:00] you remember the story honor of our
[51:02] swinglord you know how you pronounce it
[51:04] you know this day i die for switzerland
[51:07] and that was used to conquer the
[51:10] big army that was coming
[51:13] see one person so it's not an end not a
[51:15] group of things it's an individual
[51:19] we want to try to get the person next to
[51:21] us straightened out
[51:25] right
[51:27] or we want to do like a condo at that
[51:28] time which is in there but people say
[51:31] brother branham was really saying is
[51:33] your wife worthy the
[51:34] gospel you know when he preached is your
[51:36] life worthy of the gospel
[51:40] see we get the winning straight now
[51:41] we're ready to go
[51:44] yeah we're
[51:49] when it don't come when we first ask for
[51:51] it
[51:52] we first confess it
[51:56] i mean
[51:59] if it don't come inside it's fine
[52:01] do you know when that happens right
[52:05] and you know when little babies are
[52:07] little babies they cry you just run to
[52:09] them
[52:10] right
[52:12] but you know after a while you find out
[52:13] it ain't gonna kill that kid to cry
[52:18] makes his lungs better
[52:20] makes him movable
[52:23] makes him learn to behave
[52:27] but
[52:28] i'm still oh dodie granddaddy i can't
[52:30] stand for him to cry
[52:32] well a terrence can't he'll grab one of
[52:34] them wade king
[52:35] all of us say that away baby cries we
[52:37] get it
[52:39] i know that
[52:42] but listen
[52:45] sight and time
[52:47] and the prophet said
[52:50] that that was where eve failed at
[52:54] that she couldn't wait for god
[52:56] to fulfill his word
[53:01] she had been told that they were going
[53:02] to multiply and replenish
[53:06] right
[53:08] but she couldn't wait now those are
[53:09] quotes that you can read spoken words
[53:11] original seed
[53:14] paragraph
[53:15] 124 125.
[53:21] but why is it that we can't wait
[53:26] on god
[53:30] well yeah we can go down to the doctor's
[53:32] office
[53:33] and wait all day to get to see the
[53:35] doctor to tell us
[53:37] ain't nothing i can do for you
[53:40] or you need to take an aspirin
[53:43] i think i'd help you
[53:46] i want to send them a bill
[53:49] don't you
[53:51] i mean i'd like to send them a bill
[53:54] how much is your services worth well i
[53:56] get 20 i get a hundred dollars we
[53:59] calculate around here i can make about
[54:00] 200 an hour okay i'm not that bad i'll
[54:03] just send you a bill for fifty dollars
[54:07] you know that's true isn't it i mean but
[54:10] you know they're not concerned they just
[54:12] keep piling in patience
[54:14] they don't care if if them walks out the
[54:16] other house gonna pay
[54:19] but we sit there all day long
[54:22] or as i said well for five hours
[54:29] we can't wait on god five minutes
[54:34] right
[54:36] shot and time
[54:41] but you know god loves go to number four
[54:44] which is e39 of jehovah gyra
[54:47] and this is where the thought comes from
[54:51] we had the number four brother
[55:00] and look about it look at what he said
[55:03] number four
[55:04] yep joel jehovah
[55:06] now what if abraham would have took the
[55:08] second thought
[55:10] how am i going to be a father of nations
[55:12] when you're i am this old and you're
[55:14] asking me to kill and destroy the only
[55:16] evidence that i have
[55:18] that you'll keep your word
[55:20] and make me a father of nations
[55:23] and god loves to test his people
[55:27] every child that comes to god must be
[55:29] tested child trained
[55:32] no exceptions ever won
[55:36] and maybe tonight
[55:38] that you're sick
[55:41] just to have a little child training
[55:45] just a little
[55:46] testing
[55:48] don't be discouraged
[55:51] yeah but but i want to be well
[55:55] that's right
[55:58] you're just hindering
[56:00] see god's on the throne he knows all
[56:02] things if we were truly born to the
[56:04] spirit of god everything working
[56:06] together for our good
[56:08] he's going to make everything right he
[56:11] promised he would he swore he would and
[56:13] he's got to keep his
[56:15] keep that word
[56:18] but he's kept it now for oh
[56:20] thousands of years
[56:22] to ever believe her
[56:25] would you be any exception no sir
[56:28] we're no exception now watch him
[56:33] we don't say are you sick for the glory
[56:36] of the lord brother moat had a good
[56:38] point somebody say i i've got a leg off
[56:41] for the glory of the lord
[56:43] he said we'll take the other and i'll
[56:44] make it double glory
[56:46] no you don't want to do that now
[56:50] no
[56:51] the glory that lord the lord gets out of
[56:54] doing is the
[56:56] healing right
[56:58] we're not sick for the glory of the lord
[57:02] it's the healing
[57:04] that brings him glory
[57:07] all right
[57:09] and think about it
[57:12] god loves to test you
[57:15] so he lets you get sick
[57:19] now none of us want to hurt
[57:22] right we're human
[57:26] but see that's where you
[57:28] we want to quote what we want
[57:32] see what if you're sick
[57:36] to be a little child training
[57:41] we failed the test what is they're
[57:42] always saying about when you fail the
[57:45] test
[57:46] you've got to go through it again
[57:49] right
[57:51] all right
[57:53] so then as he's testing us
[57:56] to see what we'll do
[57:58] well brother dale how do i know the
[57:59] difference
[58:00] between testing me
[58:02] and i'm guilty
[58:04] i don't have to explain that
[58:08] right
[58:11] i should not even have to open my mouth
[58:14] to say anything about that
[58:18] you know whether you're guilty or not
[58:22] quit playing games
[58:28] right
[58:31] we want to put it on everything else
[58:33] except
[58:34] ourselves
[58:38] i've tried to explain to you
[58:40] the best that i can
[58:43] just because you got a bad cold
[58:46] doesn't mean the devil's after you
[58:50] it means you're going to live for a
[58:52] while in this world you're going to have
[58:54] a cold
[58:55] sure that's the devil we know that
[58:57] but that's not just do it remember
[59:01] now
[59:03] you see why it's so hard to preach the
[59:05] truth it's easy to preach a lie because
[59:06] you can prop up
[59:10] but you realize
[59:14] that god permits the devil
[59:17] to get on us
[59:20] and you want the quotes from the prophet
[59:22] that he can't get on you
[59:24] unless god permits it
[59:30] come on
[59:32] do we believe all the message yes
[59:36] well you know what that we should be
[59:39] we should say
[59:41] well you know what
[59:44] god taught enough of me to let me be put
[59:45] to a test
[59:48] i should honor him for that
[59:50] instead of being upset with him god
[59:52] what's going wrong
[59:56] what did i do
[59:57] you know what you've done
[1:00:02] you're trying to prop the thing up
[1:00:06] i know when i'm guilty of doing things
[1:00:09] don't you
[1:00:13] i mean you got to have somebody hold up
[1:00:15] a sign
[1:00:16] the women
[1:00:18] don't cut your hair
[1:00:23] back to where it was last night and this
[1:00:24] morning what
[1:00:28] are you going to go do that
[1:00:29] prove your loss to start with
[1:00:32] but you got to sign up
[1:00:34] i've got to carry sign out here every
[1:00:35] sunday
[1:00:37] don't cut your hair
[1:00:39] don't wear your pants
[1:00:41] don't paint your face
[1:00:45] you know whether you're guilty or not of
[1:00:48] doing these things
[1:00:52] you don't have to have nobody to tell
[1:00:53] you
[1:00:54] you know
[1:00:57] what you're trying to do is hide it from
[1:00:58] everybody else
[1:01:01] right
[1:01:05] but see god wants to test us
[1:01:09] he said don't be certain of god that he
[1:01:11] loves to test your faith
[1:01:19] you mean god loves to test
[1:01:21] our faith
[1:01:23] our revelation
[1:01:24] or
[1:01:25] yeah
[1:01:27] to let us see whether it's real or not
[1:01:30] if it's real it'll stand the test
[1:01:34] if it ain't real we're going to lose it
[1:01:37] right
[1:01:39] he loves to test it
[1:01:42] every child we read the scripture
[1:01:47] every child
[1:01:51] must be tested
[1:01:53] and child trained
[1:01:59] well i thought i was so good that god
[1:02:00] didn't want
[1:02:04] i thought i was so s sweet and nice
[1:02:09] that god
[1:02:10] he don't have to whip me
[1:02:13] i just do what he wants me to do
[1:02:16] you just lied
[1:02:21] i try to do what i can
[1:02:24] but there's still a lot of things that i
[1:02:26] don't try to do and don't do it right so
[1:02:29] then i'm not in the category
[1:02:32] i'm in the category that we all have
[1:02:34] problems as human beings
[1:02:40] but what about being tried
[1:02:46] what about god allowing the cankerworm
[1:02:47] fine worm locust caterpillar to come on
[1:02:50] that church down to the ages
[1:02:53] we're just dealing with the
[1:02:55] human
[1:02:56] life
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:58] you know things going against his people
[1:02:59] speaking again what about down the dark
[1:03:01] ages and the time
[1:03:03] where they were killed
[1:03:06] and god allowed that to happen
[1:03:12] to try them
[1:03:16] 68 million killed by their own records
[1:03:21] and every one of them was a test in a
[1:03:23] trial
[1:03:24] if they were all true born-again
[1:03:26] believers
[1:03:31] now i've tried to illustrate it to keep
[1:03:32] it from being so
[1:03:34] hard about it
[1:03:36] what kind of a situation do you think
[1:03:37] about happening
[1:03:38] when
[1:03:39] the catholic priest is standing there
[1:03:41] with a cross and jesus on it and he
[1:03:43] walks up before you and
[1:03:45] he says
[1:03:49] deny that faith and i look at him and i
[1:03:51] say the cross says you believe jesus i
[1:03:53] believe jesus
[1:03:55] don't you pray to jesus i pray to jesus
[1:04:00] you understand
[1:04:05] but when it comes down to the point
[1:04:08] he says do you believe
[1:04:11] the pope has the authority
[1:04:14] to change the word you say no
[1:04:17] you're contrary to their thoughts
[1:04:20] you're talking about the same god
[1:04:24] what faith is he trying to get you to
[1:04:26] deny
[1:04:28] the truth of one true and living god
[1:04:31] and believing it the way they say for
[1:04:33] you to believe it
[1:04:34] what's the difference in it
[1:04:37] you see how it was that some gave in
[1:04:39] because
[1:04:40] they knew they were going to face death
[1:04:42] and what's so horrible he plays in jesus
[1:04:45] i believe in jesus he believes he was
[1:04:47] god i believe he was god
[1:04:51] brother brown said to people in the end
[1:04:52] time would give in
[1:04:54] thinking it was better to serve god
[1:04:57] publicly
[1:04:59] than to not serve him at all unquote
[1:05:00] from the church book he said but to
[1:05:02] believe satan's lie
[1:05:04] is to serve satan
[1:05:10] i'm glad to fellowship with anybody
[1:05:13] no matter what church it is
[1:05:15] systems or message people
[1:05:19] i don't think it's a horrible sin to
[1:05:20] fellowship
[1:05:23] no
[1:05:26] but now to me to give up my ideas to
[1:05:28] fellowship
[1:05:30] won't work
[1:05:31] i told him when we started i did with in
[1:05:33] the fellowship meeting i said when the
[1:05:35] day comes
[1:05:38] that a baptist preacher can't come to a
[1:05:40] fellowship meeting and tell you what he
[1:05:42] believes
[1:05:46] i said that day i'll get out
[1:05:48] of the fellowship meeting
[1:05:51] he said yeah but he's wrong nobody's got
[1:05:53] a right
[1:05:55] but i told him also i said today comes
[1:05:58] when you try to make me believe your
[1:06:00] doctrine
[1:06:05] i will move out
[1:06:07] because i will not follow your doctrine
[1:06:10] god has helped us over all of these
[1:06:12] years
[1:06:13] to keep them from trying to bring in
[1:06:15] even
[1:06:16] preachers to preach their pity little
[1:06:18] doctrines in their own church it's been
[1:06:20] real good
[1:06:22] because i guess they knew i meant what i
[1:06:24] said
[1:06:26] you try to make me believe your doctrine
[1:06:28] i'm going to rebel
[1:06:31] if your doctrine's not right
[1:06:35] i'm going to say no
[1:06:38] and i'm going to move away
[1:06:42] why because i have to stand for what i
[1:06:44] believe
[1:06:47] but i can sit down beside of a two soul
[1:06:49] seventh under virtue perusing i shake
[1:06:51] his hand hug his neck call him brother
[1:06:54] but i can hug the pope's neck call him
[1:06:56] brother the baptist preacher billy
[1:06:58] graham anybody
[1:07:03] i can call him brother
[1:07:06] that doesn't mean i agree with what they
[1:07:08] say
[1:07:10] that means i'm trying to be what i'm
[1:07:11] supposed to be a christian
[1:07:18] you follow me
[1:07:21] but you see he loves to test our faith
[1:07:27] he loves to do it
[1:07:30] he knows what we're going to do
[1:07:32] but we don't know what we're going to do
[1:07:36] you got to be put to a test to find out
[1:07:43] it'd be like donnie said
[1:07:46] i read the book
[1:07:48] i can build a transmission
[1:07:53] i can just build that transmission i
[1:07:55] know every part by name
[1:07:57] what it looks like
[1:07:59] all the dimensions of it
[1:08:04] the guy hands him a transmission he said
[1:08:07] i'm afraid to touch it
[1:08:10] well he don't trust what he's got
[1:08:15] he don't trust what he's got
[1:08:18] the test is whether or not he can take
[1:08:19] it apart put it back together
[1:08:22] right that's the test
[1:08:27] everybody lies at me and even the
[1:08:28] neighbor runner said anybody that you
[1:08:30] can take a trailer and make a house out
[1:08:32] of it you can do anything he wants to
[1:08:37] when you get tested sometimes
[1:08:39] trying to work on things when
[1:08:42] tony can tell you
[1:08:44] he's trying to lay his tile on the floor
[1:08:46] and you're just a quarter of an inch out
[1:08:48] and at a while it don't look right
[1:08:54] well it's a test
[1:08:56] see then after a while you got to learn
[1:08:58] before you start you find out if it's
[1:09:01] level
[1:09:02] if it's a quarter of an inch out you
[1:09:04] build that quarter of an inch up before
[1:09:05] you start
[1:09:06] i got a room at the house
[1:09:08] that from one side of it it's flat zero
[1:09:11] and i cut boards to five inches on the
[1:09:13] other side that's how out of level the
[1:09:16] porch was it used to be the deck because
[1:09:19] it allowed water to run off
[1:09:22] but you couldn't walk through my office
[1:09:24] you know and sat down in the chair with
[1:09:26] it
[1:09:28] so i leveled it up
[1:09:32] and then put a floor down
[1:09:34] you can't tell it
[1:09:37] i can tell you say which way did it lean
[1:09:39] you wouldn't know
[1:09:42] but what's my point
[1:09:45] god loves to try you and i
[1:09:49] to see whether or not we've got a
[1:09:50] substance faith or a mental faith
[1:09:55] if somebody can talk you out of it it's
[1:09:57] mental
[1:10:01] it's not substance
[1:10:03] we're going to get into substance faith
[1:10:05] when we get a change
[1:10:06] but remember
[1:10:08] substance faith don't come first
[1:10:11] right mental faith comes and then
[1:10:13] substance faith goes on blasphemy this
[1:10:15] name he said
[1:10:17] coming down true
[1:10:19] he said from your mental faith becomes a
[1:10:21] spiritual revelation
[1:10:24] now you got something you stand on
[1:10:28] you mean after all you've heard about
[1:10:30] one god
[1:10:31] that somebody could prove a trinity to
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:35] oh
[1:10:38] come on
[1:10:39] well they just made it so beautiful
[1:10:44] huh
[1:10:46] but it'd be like donnie's sitting there
[1:10:48] and you already took he's read the book
[1:10:51] he knows the dimension knows everything
[1:10:53] he took it apart put it back together
[1:10:54] and it works
[1:10:55] and he built ten of them and they work
[1:10:57] then somebody comes along said i want to
[1:10:59] improve that
[1:11:01] i want to show you how to change that
[1:11:04] well there's things that can be done
[1:11:06] right
[1:11:07] but then he turns around and gives you
[1:11:09] something that won't work
[1:11:12] you know immediately there's something
[1:11:14] wrong
[1:11:15] and you don't want to do it that way
[1:11:19] that's just the way i am in the gospel
[1:11:23] this thing has stood for
[1:11:27] 2 000 years
[1:11:30] in the faith of the fathers
[1:11:33] why do we want to go to something else
[1:11:37] or somebody else's concept
[1:11:40] especially to these
[1:11:42] that the concepts they have have no
[1:11:44] vindication
[1:11:50] they don't get up and say
[1:11:54] i'm going to tell you the truth
[1:11:56] god's going to vindicate it
[1:11:58] no
[1:12:00] they will one day
[1:12:03] and that's where it's going to be worse
[1:12:04] it is now
[1:12:07] mental faith can become a spiritual
[1:12:09] revelation
[1:12:10] if
[1:12:13] we believe it
[1:12:16] right that's my life's talk if we
[1:12:18] believe it
[1:12:19] and accept it
[1:12:21] and walk in it
[1:12:23] the first basis is where's it at
[1:12:26] it's in the word
[1:12:31] sometimes i have to say i believe things
[1:12:33] because the bible says it
[1:12:36] all right okay
[1:12:39] sometimes i say i believe things because
[1:12:41] the prophet said
[1:12:43] no that's mentally believing it
[1:12:46] but i like what oh
[1:12:49] it brother
[1:12:49] brother maloney i'm pretty sure it was
[1:12:53] he had a tp on his bible
[1:12:57] he that was christian ftp
[1:12:59] one day i said
[1:13:01] brother what does that tp mean he said
[1:13:03] tried and proven
[1:13:06] well
[1:13:08] you know
[1:13:09] we stood here at lula georgia not
[1:13:12] bragging but just talking playing
[1:13:15] when all the rest of the world just
[1:13:17] about it has gone after some form
[1:13:20] of doctrines
[1:13:24] and we wound up walking along
[1:13:27] nowhere to go preach
[1:13:29] nowhere to go fellowship truly
[1:13:34] but you know what
[1:13:37] if i walk by myself
[1:13:39] i will keep walking
[1:13:43] that's my point
[1:13:46] and i want people with me
[1:13:49] that are not afraid
[1:13:53] not afraid to be tested
[1:13:56] i told them brother callie one day i
[1:13:59] said i'm going to get you into the
[1:14:00] biggest argument that i've ever got in
[1:14:03] with anybody and i'm going to back off
[1:14:05] and get around the corner
[1:14:07] he said what that's called i want to
[1:14:09] know what you believe
[1:14:13] i want him to be put to the test
[1:14:17] to see whether he believes it or not
[1:14:20] there must needs to be heresies among
[1:14:22] you what
[1:14:25] they that are approved are they that are
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:29] will be made manifest
[1:14:33] hard thing to say but thank god for
[1:14:35] false doctrine because it makes you
[1:14:37] think
[1:14:39] i will remember the day when the two
[1:14:41] souls was starting in the message
[1:14:44] they were in the
[1:14:45] late 60s
[1:14:48] and how they were dealing with it in the
[1:14:50] seventh under virtue message and the
[1:14:52] error and hitting so many home runs and
[1:14:54] bringing them all home and all of the
[1:14:56] great tops and shadows
[1:14:58] i will remember
[1:15:00] those days
[1:15:03] that those things were taking place
[1:15:08] but you know what every one of them made
[1:15:10] me dig
[1:15:12] when they were talking about whether you
[1:15:13] had two souls or not and satan give your
[1:15:16] soul and god give you a soul and
[1:15:19] i mean i could quote feist enough that
[1:15:21] satan can't give you a soul he's not a
[1:15:23] creator but that wouldn't what anchored
[1:15:26] it in me
[1:15:32] it was an argument of quotes on that
[1:15:34] basis
[1:15:36] but one day i was thinking
[1:15:39] about what had been said
[1:15:44] and a knowledge came to me
[1:15:52] that the new birth
[1:15:55] brings christ into you
[1:15:58] as the person of christ
[1:16:01] and that that's not a physical stepping
[1:16:03] into me of
[1:16:04] of god
[1:16:09] but that's your soul
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:12] and body to body he's a man a brother to
[1:16:14] me
[1:16:15] spirit to spirit he's an anointing the
[1:16:17] help and the god and the comforter
[1:16:20] the soul the soul
[1:16:24] then my soul is my theophany
[1:16:27] after i'm born again
[1:16:29] and carries me on
[1:16:31] you know what the thrill to me was when
[1:16:34] they were talking about how many souls
[1:16:35] you had no it's a carnal way of saying
[1:16:37] it i'm sorry
[1:16:39] but god spoke to me and telling me that
[1:16:42] he was a soul
[1:16:46] not that he had one
[1:16:49] if he had one that was an upgrade of a
[1:16:51] doctrine
[1:16:52] but that he was the very heart and soul
[1:16:57] of almighty
[1:17:01] i god thank you lord
[1:17:04] i'm glad them brothers preached that
[1:17:09] brother come to the church where was
[1:17:10] that at that time years ago and preached
[1:17:12] a doctrine
[1:17:14] and i couldn't figure it out i told you
[1:17:15] a little bit about it last night
[1:17:17] and i couldn't bypass that book
[1:17:19] i just kept going over it and i'd
[1:17:21] re-read and i'd go back to that book go
[1:17:22] back to that page
[1:17:24] i said okay i saw this
[1:17:26] i got in the car coming home i said
[1:17:27] brother mo
[1:17:29] i didn't tell him what i was thinking i
[1:17:31] said explain this page
[1:17:35] what is he saying
[1:17:39] and when he finished it
[1:17:42] i said no i know
[1:17:45] god is real
[1:17:49] he's not just an imagination of your
[1:17:51] mind
[1:17:53] as we were talking about last night at
[1:17:54] the brother remember had to powerpoint
[1:17:56] years ago and had this great thing and
[1:17:58] then it moved over here and up here he
[1:18:00] just had a pulsating of light like
[1:18:02] things or something that that was just
[1:18:05] god the great energy well that's what
[1:18:07] science believes
[1:18:13] science believes it and can prove that
[1:18:15] the energy cannot be created nor
[1:18:17] destroyed
[1:18:19] that's scientific fact
[1:18:21] it cannot be created not destroyed
[1:18:23] it can be moved into ability to use but
[1:18:26] it can't be created or destroyed within
[1:18:29] they are seeing god
[1:18:31] but yet putting it in the wrong
[1:18:33] terminology
[1:18:37] god's not a pulsating light
[1:18:39] or as they got it on the uh
[1:18:42] the correct me kids what is it the uh
[1:18:45] ninja turtles or ones of their own they
[1:18:47] got this guy that's supposed to be the
[1:18:49] brain you remember there's a great big
[1:18:50] guy
[1:18:51] down in the stomach here is a big old
[1:18:53] brain
[1:18:55] now i get my cartoons wrong
[1:18:58] okay there's someone we're saying it's
[1:18:59] okay
[1:19:03] that's not god
[1:19:06] god's not a brain
[1:19:09] god don't have a soul he is
[1:19:12] a soul because a soul is a person amen
[1:19:16] he don't have a person he is the person
[1:19:18] right
[1:19:20] the only person amen
[1:19:23] and he's real
[1:19:27] see doctrines makes you dig
[1:19:30] well
[1:19:30] was jesus not god until the river jordan
[1:19:33] quote
[1:19:34] quote see
[1:19:38] makes you dig
[1:19:41] and you come find out what happened to
[1:19:43] him on river jordan
[1:19:45] when the prophet said on the river
[1:19:47] jordan is when he become the fullness of
[1:19:48] the godhead bodily well what was it
[1:19:50] before then like wade said he gave us a
[1:19:52] quote on where he would already fullness
[1:19:54] of the godhead body he was god laying in
[1:19:55] a cradle god with no teeth why is the
[1:19:58] prophet saying
[1:20:00] get on the river jordan
[1:20:02] see that's where the anointing came
[1:20:05] for jesus's ministry
[1:20:07] to put him into the ministry to send him
[1:20:10] forth that didn't make him the messiah
[1:20:12] that made him the anointed messiah
[1:20:18] god with us
[1:20:20] yes
[1:20:22] when that anointing comes back in this
[1:20:23] bride she will be the fullness of the
[1:20:26] godhead bodily she will be the anointed
[1:20:29] messiah
[1:20:37] but like we talked about last night
[1:20:39] it's hard to explain god
[1:20:42] because we want to think about something
[1:20:44] that becomes exhausted to move over to
[1:20:46] another point it'll finally become
[1:20:48] exhausted and
[1:20:49] you know
[1:20:50] no
[1:20:51] the more brother moak said we think it's
[1:20:54] like cutting up an apple you give out to
[1:20:55] pieces you run out of apple
[1:20:57] no the more god gives out the more god
[1:21:00] there is
[1:21:02] the greater it makes him
[1:21:04] the more he gives out the more he can
[1:21:07] expand himself the greater he is
[1:21:11] what a wonderful understanding
[1:21:14] of god in his ways
[1:21:18] what a wonderful substance come on
[1:21:20] brothers
[1:21:22] what a wonderful substance
[1:21:25] that you and i can have
[1:21:30] yeah but the theologian said so and so
[1:21:34] okay
[1:21:37] we'll pay for the theologian
[1:21:39] huh
[1:21:41] if he tells me the truth i believe it
[1:21:45] right
[1:21:52] but what about it
[1:21:55] do you have a substance
[1:21:57] or a mental faith
[1:22:01] we're going to be tried to see which one
[1:22:03] it is
[1:22:09] we're going to be tried by it
[1:22:12] what do we got right now

[1:25:48] us
[1:25:49] and brought us to an understanding
[1:25:54] and even our children
[1:25:56] it's an amazing thing of what they know
[1:25:58] about god in his ways
[1:26:12] is
[1:26:22] he loves to test us
[1:26:28] but the test is no good unless somebody
[1:26:30] can pass it
[1:26:32] right
[1:26:37] somebody is
[1:26:39] somebody's going to stand the test and
[1:26:41] pass that test
