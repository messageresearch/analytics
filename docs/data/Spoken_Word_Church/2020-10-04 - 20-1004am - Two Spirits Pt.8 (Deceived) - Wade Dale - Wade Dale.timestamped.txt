[17:06] fill us with your love and grace that's
[17:08] all we got to hang on to nothing else to
[17:10] hang on to around here are they
[17:13] so glad to be a christian
[17:16] to where we know where we come from know
[17:18] what we're doing here we know where
[17:20] we're going
[17:21] we're not like the world and you look at
[17:23] the world we
[17:24] had a festival down in uh maysville
[17:27] yesterday and
[17:28] you look around at the people and you
[17:31] see some that don't care and you see
[17:32] something that's scared to death so you
[17:34] got
[17:34] all kinds you know but the ones that are
[17:38] scared to death don't know the lord
[17:41] and the ones that don't seem to care
[17:43] they don't know the lord either
[17:45] so you know we know the lord
[17:49] because we have him inside of us
[17:52] and we know one thing's for sure
[17:55] i was talking to a minister yesterday
[17:59] he said you know it's just a time of
[18:02] pressure even though nothing uh
[18:05] in in his town they've been hit but um
[18:10] we were discussing where brother brown
[18:11] told us when he preached the countdown
[18:15] he said we were the ones that were
[18:16] pressurized for this age
[18:19] so we he had to equip us
[18:22] when when john f kennedy
[18:27] told nasa in 1963 or 62
[18:32] we're going to the moon before the end
[18:36] of this decade
[18:38] and they did it in april of 1969
[18:42] all right what did they have to do they
[18:46] had to
[18:46] equip a group of people that had to do
[18:50] something
[18:51] that they'd never done before they had
[18:54] never been to the moon they
[18:56] had never been in two or three different
[18:58] capsules where one's got to pull apart
[19:00] from the other one and all these things
[19:01] what am i saying if man if if that tree
[19:06] of knowledge of good and evil
[19:09] can send a man to the moon and now
[19:11] they're talking about going to mars
[19:14] then why can't we offer the tree of life
[19:19] realize that we're pressurized for this
[19:21] age
[19:22] and that god had to equip us so he sent
[19:25] us a prophet
[19:27] to equip us on how to navigate
[19:30] through this world that we're living in
[19:31] god bless you um
[19:34] continue to pray for brother dale as as
[19:36] terrence said sister
[19:37] ruth is down there now um assessing the
[19:40] situation
[19:42] so we we thank god for nurses this is
[19:44] there's a special place
[19:47] um people like her and sister amy and
[19:54] that's good
[20:00] man you can't beat that antibiotics and
[20:02] ice cream
[20:04] he'll be at church wednesday night
[20:07] but we need to just keep praying we need
[20:10] you know she
[20:11] she agreed to go down and check on him
[20:13] and
[20:14] uh pray for mom too she's she's a little
[20:16] bit nervous about the whole thing so
[20:18] would we all
[20:18] i mean that's her husband of 60 some odd
[20:21] years so
[20:22] we are praying for supernatural strength
[20:25] for both of them
[20:27] and let the body work its course
[20:30] you know god give us an ability
[20:34] to fight off infection and even if we
[20:36] got infection to get rid of it and then
[20:38] he gave us some wonderful doctors to
[20:39] give us
[20:39] medication we we agree with all that
[20:43] okay we agree with all that uh not
[20:46] denying anything but we know one thing's
[20:48] for sure
[20:49] when brother dale walks back in this
[20:50] room it was god that did the healing
[20:53] man gave him something just to kind of
[20:55] it's what we're going to talk about
[20:56] today you know
[20:58] that's because this is the effects of
[20:59] the fall
[21:01] this is the effects of what happened
[21:02] when we're what we're talking about
[21:04] between adam and eve brother brown said
[21:05] every graveyard
[21:07] every hospital every he named off
[21:09] several things happened because of that
[21:11] one word off in the garden of eden
[21:13] so but he did equip us to make it
[21:16] through this
[21:18] and that's what i'm holding on to is
[21:19] that he quit he said for me to
[21:21] that i was going to be an astronaut i'm
[21:23] going to get out of here
[21:25] so he's got to equip me just like the
[21:27] united states of america equip their
[21:28] astronauts with the best equipment
[21:31] even though something went wrong there
[21:32] with apollo 13 guess what
[21:34] they worked it out listen god's already
[21:37] got this thing worked out
[21:39] he knows every up and down every in and
[21:41] out and he is god on the mountain
[21:44] and god in the valley so um brother
[21:47] louise will be speaking
[21:48] it is your turn because bob brother
[21:51] aaron bro louise
[21:52] we'll be speaking wednesday night lord
[21:53] willing we'll have our regular service
[21:55] on wednesday
[21:57] just like this but now next sunday for
[22:00] sure just like this sunday we're only
[22:02] going to have one service
[22:03] start at 10 o'clock we're doing just
[22:05] like we're doing today anyone can come
[22:07] the downstairs is pretty full up here
[22:09] full too so we're just praying that um
[22:13] brother dale will get a good report and
[22:14] we get him back in
[22:16] getting back in the saddle so um
[22:19] we thank the lord for the things that
[22:21] he's given us he's given us an
[22:23] opportunity to serve him and that's what
[22:25] exactly what we need to do do it to our
[22:27] best all right
[22:28] so also today um
[22:32] it's kind of funny there were some more
[22:34] questions came in it's really not funny
[22:35] but
[22:36] today if you'll pull up the screen we're
[22:38] not going to talk about twins we got to
[22:39] kind of leave that alone we got to go
[22:41] back to this word
[22:43] deceived because the questions that were
[22:47] asked are good
[22:48] questions and and today i want to
[22:50] caution you that i'm going to have to
[22:52] say some things that
[22:54] may be a little i don't want you to take
[22:56] it rough listen because
[22:57] people thought brother branham was a
[22:59] woman hater people thought elijah was a
[23:00] woman hater but now look
[23:03] god doesn't hate women
[23:09] brother branham didn't hate women but a
[23:12] woman is a type of the church and eve
[23:14] was a female
[23:16] type of the church but remember
[23:20] uh you uh we've heard sermons all of us
[23:22] just been here a long time we've heard
[23:24] sermons with
[23:24] preachers get up here and they brow beat
[23:27] the sisters
[23:29] well i thought the bible said that you
[23:31] treat your wife
[23:32] as christ treats you we forget as
[23:36] men that we are all female
[23:39] in the body of christ so whatever is
[23:41] being said
[23:43] if there's a sorry woman a or a dog
[23:45] or a like brother
[23:46] i'm talking about do you know that we
[23:48] all were
[23:51] in our mind we were born between satan
[23:55] and eve
[23:56] born bastard children
[24:00] so don't get all upset when we start
[24:03] talking about
[24:04] females and what eve did and what adam
[24:06] did because one of the questions is
[24:08] and i don't the the the what's the it's
[24:12] not funny it's just that
[24:13] all the questions were asked by women in
[24:16] the church here
[24:17] every one of them not a man didn't ask
[24:19] one question
[24:20] all by the females so quit laughing
[24:23] there you'll
[24:24] who told ask the question back there
[24:28] but there's a recurring question that
[24:30] keeps coming and i don't realize
[24:32] i don't think you realize how deceived
[24:34] eve was
[24:35] remember the bible says she was deceived
[24:38] adam was not
[24:39] that's right right so eve as the church
[24:42] today whatever's happening in the garden
[24:44] of eden
[24:45] is still a deception going on today in
[24:48] the female
[24:49] church even the bride yes
[24:54] that's what we got to get back to that
[24:56] one word off
[24:57] that's why god sent us a prophet to put
[25:00] the perfect word in front of us
[25:02] to see what we do about it so today when
[25:05] we mention things about being deceived
[25:07] and a woman being a million times
[25:09] you just realize one thing's for sure
[25:12] you think about it sisters
[25:14] then you think about it brothers in the
[25:16] in some of the false doctrine that we've
[25:18] come through
[25:19] some of the father-son holy ghost
[25:20] baptism that we swallowed
[25:22] that's just as deceived as your sweet
[25:26] little wife
[25:28] because we're the sweet little wife of
[25:29] jesus christ and remember she was
[25:31] deceived first time in the garden
[25:34] she was deceived at nicaea
[25:40] and she's still being deceived now so
[25:43] that deception is what we need to cover
[25:46] and i want you to realize that deception
[25:49] is still here okay so that's what we're
[25:52] going to talk about but we will have to
[25:54] say a few things i'm going to quote
[25:55] brother branham
[25:57] in a lot of things but i'm going to talk
[25:58] to you just for a few minutes
[26:00] because listen the deception is why
[26:02] we're still here
[26:04] in the female part of jesus christ which
[26:06] is the bride
[26:09] if she was deceived at nigel because
[26:11] remember we end up
[26:12] in this church age with blind wretched
[26:15] and miserable and what
[26:18] naked and don't know it now that's what
[26:20] happened in the garden of eden
[26:21] here we come to last church age and we
[26:23] go right back to the garden of eden
[26:25] to see that eve was deceived in what she
[26:28] did
[26:29] adam was not all right now that's a
[26:32] bible
[26:32] and that's the prophet's message so
[26:34] let's get started here with the two
[26:35] spirits
[26:36] and look at deception or deceived and
[26:38] we'll look at that word but i want to
[26:40] um background just a few minutes so
[26:43] first john 4
[26:43] verse 1 let's bow our heads
[26:47] the heavenly father thank you for this
[26:48] day that you give us we pray now that
[26:50] you sanctify us for this journey
[26:52] that we're on lord truly this is your
[26:55] day
[26:56] but not just your day you've included
[26:58] your bride in this day
[27:01] lord that we're supposed to stand in
[27:02] this end time
[27:04] regardless of what comes what may
[27:07] regardless of the judas's and all the
[27:09] different things the diff the other
[27:11] spirit that's
[27:11] that's contacting us and trying to make
[27:13] us go wrong
[27:15] trying to give us false doctrine false
[27:17] word false seed
[27:18] lord you said there would be a bride
[27:20] that would be virtuous
[27:22] that would be white that would not have
[27:25] her skirts
[27:26] wrinkled that everything would be pure
[27:28] father we're
[27:29] depending on your word to develop
[27:32] as we were talking about nasa developing
[27:35] a
[27:36] crew and a ship lord you've equipped us
[27:39] for this
[27:40] but it's right here in the word we don't
[27:42] have to go anywhere to get it it's right
[27:43] here in your word father we just got to
[27:45] be able to look at it
[27:47] and not be deceived and see what god's
[27:50] already give to us lord in the word
[27:52] father we ask you just be with brother
[27:53] dale
[27:54] and sister dale be with all the bride
[27:56] around the world many people we talked
[27:57] to yesterday several pastors and several
[27:59] people telling them about brother dale
[28:03] lord they've got some of the same
[28:05] situations in their church so we're not
[28:06] alone
[28:08] we're not alone because we got you
[28:11] but satan is raging in our body he's
[28:13] trying to get us this way
[28:15] but he can't do anything unless you're
[28:18] finished with us
[28:19] father we pray that you'll be with us
[28:21] now and take care of us and further in
[28:22] this service in jesus name we pray
[28:24] amen first john 4 verse 1 beloved
[28:26] believe not every spirit but try the
[28:28] spirits were
[28:29] they of god because many false prophets
[28:31] are gone out into the world hereby
[28:34] know ye the spirit of god every spirit
[28:36] that confesses that jesus christ has
[28:37] come in the flesh
[28:38] is of god and every spirit that
[28:40] confesses not that jesus christ has come
[28:42] in the flesh
[28:43] it's not of god and this is that spirit
[28:45] of antichrist
[28:47] whereof you have heard that it should
[28:48] come and even now already is in the
[28:50] world
[28:52] all right now that spirit of antichrist
[28:53] was in the garden it was right here with
[28:56] john
[28:56] and it's right here now all right
[29:00] but now the second adam came to destroy
[29:04] the effects of that we just got to
[29:06] believe it remember it's pardoned not a
[29:08] part until accepted as a pardon we must
[29:10] accept that pardon you say oh i accepted
[29:13] it yeah you may have accepted part of it
[29:16] when you got your new birth you accepted
[29:18] the part that jesus christ paid your
[29:20] debt
[29:20] and made your soul eternal by the
[29:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[29:23] but he not only died for that he died
[29:25] for this thing too
[29:27] amen he died to turn this back to the
[29:29] garden of eden where it should have been
[29:31] that's why brother branham and christ
[29:32] the mystery of god revealed what'd he
[29:34] say
[29:34] all god was deported to christ all
[29:36] christ he poured into the church take
[29:38] her back to
[29:39] the garden of eden all right so we know
[29:42] that you're god little children you're
[29:44] of god little children
[29:45] you have overcome them because greater
[29:47] is he that's in you than he that's in
[29:48] the world
[29:49] they are of the world therefore speak
[29:51] they of the world
[29:52] and the world heareth them we are of god
[29:54] he that knoweth god heareth us and he
[29:56] that is not of god here if not
[29:57] us hereby know we now look how confident
[30:00] john was
[30:02] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[30:05] and the spirit of error you may be
[30:06] seated in the lord as blessing
[30:08] but now remember and brother brown tells
[30:11] us
[30:12] he talks about the children of
[30:14] disobedience he said
[30:16] he said now a child cannot deceive you
[30:19] as much as an adult an adult can deceive
[30:23] you
[30:23] now a little child's pretty good at it
[30:26] did you eat that cookie no
[30:27] no cookie all over that's being a liar
[30:31] but an adult we're dealing with an adult
[30:35] like i said before we
[30:36] we're dealing now with the apex we're
[30:38] dealing but now as we're dealing with
[30:40] the apex of sin
[30:42] and the apex of satan we're also dealing
[30:44] with the apex of almighty god
[30:46] amen we are the bride of jesus christ
[30:49] there is no
[30:50] second wife there is no divorce in this
[30:53] end time we are the bride of christ and
[30:56] he's going to collect
[30:57] us and take us to a wedding supper is
[30:59] that all right
[31:02] amen i hope you believe that because i
[31:05] sure do
[31:06] because he's not anywhere
[31:09] sure he is there i was thinking today
[31:11] you know we always
[31:13] and and god is a segregationist okay
[31:17] he told israel not to marry intermingle
[31:20] and they did he tells us not to enter
[31:23] not to marry you know three or four
[31:25] wives and all that thing but anyway
[31:28] he's only married to one spouse but he
[31:30] did have a divorced wife
[31:32] he does have what i was thinking about
[31:34] today was that we always
[31:36] we always look at the lamb's book of
[31:37] life and the eternal section in the
[31:39] genesis 1 26 man
[31:41] but listen folks god knows every child
[31:43] that as soon as this rapture takes place
[31:46] a child is going to heaven
[31:49] i'm not talking about bride now i'm
[31:50] talking about out in the world
[31:52] in india africa wherever there's a child
[31:55] below the age of accountability god's
[31:56] got a place for that person
[31:58] even though they're not in the plan of
[32:01] god as far as the
[32:02] salvation plan think about that
[32:06] sometimes we get kind of a narrow and i
[32:07] do like the for
[32:09] for god to talk about me you know
[32:11] because we're family but
[32:12] my he's got all these other names
[32:14] written down too
[32:17] all these foolish virgins all a cup of
[32:19] watermelon he's already got a place for
[32:21] them to live
[32:22] he made this world big enough just for
[32:24] enough people that what's going to be in
[32:26] the
[32:26] future home he's not going to have to
[32:28] make the world bigger that's right
[32:30] everybody's going to fit yes so why
[32:32] don't worry about that
[32:33] you just worry about being the one i
[32:34] want to be the one that lives in that
[32:36] city
[32:37] i want to be the one who lives in that
[32:39] city where the lamb is light and i don't
[32:40] have to
[32:41] i don't have to go outside and and
[32:45] sleep out there i stay inside and don't
[32:48] have to sleep
[32:49] amen so the lord's blessed us by giving
[32:52] us that
[32:53] information but what are we doing with
[32:55] that information are we just saying well
[32:56] that's just good information
[32:58] are we really taking it to heart and
[33:00] saying papa god
[33:01] thank you for building me a house thank
[33:03] you for getting something ready for me
[33:07] so that i can live eternally not just
[33:09] you know 70 or 80 or 90 years
[33:12] down here on earth eternal
[33:16] yeah we can't fathom that
[33:19] you know why because we're time
[33:21] creatures we got to remem we got to
[33:23] think about what we're doing tomorrow
[33:27] and what we got to do to plan our time
[33:29] to do all these things tomorrow
[33:32] don't worry about it church when the
[33:35] bible says i has not seen i've been
[33:37] trying to
[33:38] to dwell on that a little bit just just
[33:40] to see if we can
[33:43] go further into the mind of god not
[33:45] further than brother branham please help
[33:47] me
[33:48] but to go further into the mind of god
[33:50] than we've ever been before
[33:52] to be able to see through his eyes to
[33:54] see we know we see the plan of
[33:56] redemption
[33:57] but are we deceived
[34:01] like the first eve was and don't know it
[34:04] and we're looking at something that we
[34:07] shouldn't be looking at or we go down
[34:08] this road that we're not supposed to go
[34:10] down
[34:11] we're supposed to be on our gps god's
[34:14] predestinated seed or god's positioning
[34:16] system
[34:18] not man's because god don't ever say
[34:21] recalculating
[34:23] or he never says you've missed your turn
[34:26] no no no
[34:27] he's right on time every time so let's
[34:30] keep that in your mind
[34:32] eve was totally deceived
[34:36] she thought what she did ever how
[34:38] hideous we think it was
[34:40] she thought she was doing the exact
[34:43] thing god wanted her to do see if you'll
[34:46] remember that then there won't be so
[34:48] many questions of
[34:49] well why was this and why she was
[34:51] deceived
[34:53] period whatever satan fed her
[34:57] was just one word but you know he worked
[34:59] in that a little bit
[35:00] it wasn't just the one sermon thing uh
[35:03] somebody was talking
[35:05] the other day and i believe it too that
[35:07] that their mother always told them that
[35:09] um that the the uh trying to think
[35:12] who was that the beast was kind of adam
[35:15] and eve's housekeeper
[35:17] and that would be true because he can
[35:18] converse with adam and eve and he can
[35:20] converse with the animals so they were
[35:21] just kind of hanging around with the
[35:22] beast
[35:23] well here satan just jumps right in and
[35:25] he goes to talking
[35:27] it's not a one day thing listen
[35:31] he's worked been working for every how
[35:33] many thousands of years he's been
[35:35] working
[35:35] in his deception process sure he got her
[35:39] to believe but now remember
[35:40] like i said before genesis 3 14 says
[35:44] in the end time she'll be blind wretched
[35:46] and miserable naked and won't know it
[35:49] okay so now let's read number one
[35:53] we've always read it we're going to read
[35:55] it again listen we don't have a second
[35:57] service
[35:58] i know y'all eat a little extra so at 12
[36:01] o'clock you won't be going
[36:04] you'll be going hey man because one
[36:06] service we got
[36:07] we there's just no stress now brother
[36:10] and there's no stress
[36:12] now remember this christ in the true
[36:14] church is the con continuation of the
[36:16] book of acts
[36:17] now what was the book of acts that was
[36:20] when
[36:21] god's eve
[36:25] was born
[36:28] no way man said that because that's what
[36:31] he always wanted he wanted spoken word
[36:34] children so on the day of pentecost
[36:38] not 1906 80 30. when on the day of
[36:42] pentecost at the book of acts
[36:44] it was when god's bride come into view
[36:48] now remember she's going to be deceived
[36:50] again later on because satan's going to
[36:52] work right back in there
[36:53] because look christ in the true church
[36:55] is a continuation of the book of acts
[36:57] but the book of revelation shows how
[36:59] that the antichrist spirit would come
[37:00] into the church
[37:01] and defile it make it lukewarm formal
[37:03] and powerless in other words blind
[37:05] wretched miserable naked and don't know
[37:06] it all right
[37:08] it exposes satan revealing his works
[37:10] attempt the destruction of god's people
[37:12] and the discrediting of god's word now
[37:14] look what's happening now
[37:17] listen satan never presented eve
[37:21] and said you're god's fault
[37:24] right he never walked up to and said
[37:27] look you don't even need to listen to
[37:28] what that guy says
[37:29] he's just not even telling you the truth
[37:32] huh no he walked up and he said you'll
[37:35] not surely die
[37:37] from the day you eat thereof you'll be
[37:40] his gods
[37:41] well see that makes the female part the
[37:44] feelings
[37:45] feel good he didn't contact adam with
[37:47] that adam already knew he was a god
[37:51] he was the son of god he controlled this
[37:52] whole world we'll get into that in a
[37:54] minute he was the ruler of this earth he
[37:56] wasn't a blundering idiot
[37:59] okay so he knew what he was doing when
[38:01] he did what he did christ knew what he
[38:03] was doing by taking on our sin adam knew
[38:05] what he was going to do
[38:06] by taking on the sin of eve right down
[38:09] to the time he is cast into the lake of
[38:11] fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[38:14] he knows that if the people get the true
[38:16] revelation of the true church
[38:18] and what she is what she's the last
[38:21] eve she's the eve that's going to go to
[38:23] the wedding supper
[38:25] all right we're going to take a body
[38:27] change on this earth and we're going to
[38:29] destroy death on this earth
[38:32] amen what she is and what she stands for
[38:36] and that she can do the greater works
[38:39] now not greater but more brother brahma
[38:41] explains that she will be an invincible
[38:43] army
[38:43] if they get a true revelation of the two
[38:45] spirits within the framework of the
[38:47] christian church listen
[38:49] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[38:51] and the tree of life stood just like
[38:53] this in the garden
[38:55] which was who we know it was jesus
[38:57] christ and we know it was satan
[39:00] and in one place brother brown said it
[39:01] was eve because that's where it all
[39:03] came from but it had to be satan there's
[39:06] only two spirits
[39:07] god's spirit and the spirit of satan all
[39:09] right
[39:11] because remember he was cast out of
[39:12] heaven and came up down into the garden
[39:14] of eden
[39:15] if you'll read satan's eden which i've
[39:17] got some quotes here read satan's eating
[39:18] that's what the whole thing was
[39:20] satan came down here to build his
[39:21] kingdom he can't build one in heaven
[39:23] anymore because he got cast out
[39:25] so he's building it down here by what
[39:27] knowledge intelligence
[39:29] my revelation is better than yours
[39:33] i fished with him i hunted with him i
[39:35] don't have to go to church i've just
[39:36] listened to tape
[39:38] if they get a true revelation of the two
[39:39] spirits within the framework of the
[39:40] christian church and by god's spirit
[39:42] discern and withstand the antichrist
[39:44] spirit
[39:45] satan will be what i like that word when
[39:48] it comes to the devil powerless before
[39:50] her
[39:51] amen so now let's read the second one
[39:53] this is the one i was going to try to
[39:54] get to with the twins but
[39:56] since all these questions popped up
[39:57] which is great because we need to
[39:59] we need to answer these questions and
[40:00] then move on
[40:02] but listen folks if we're deceived you
[40:03] don't know it
[40:08] until somebody tells you if you're
[40:11] deceived i'm going to tell you i'm going
[40:12] to show you the definition of deceived
[40:17] you'll do these people done a lot of
[40:19] things in deception
[40:21] thinking that they were absolutely
[40:23] correct
[40:24] amen did you get it now
[40:28] these are those twins again there are
[40:30] those two trees again growing side by
[40:32] side in the same
[40:33] earth partaking of the same nourishment
[40:36] drinking in the same rain and benefited
[40:37] by the same sun
[40:39] but they come from different seeds one
[40:41] tree is for the word of god
[40:43] exactly as god gave it and loves and
[40:46] obeys it
[40:46] the other tree is from the seed that is
[40:48] anti the word of god
[40:50] and changes it where it wants to now we
[40:53] see that even happening in the message
[40:56] how can you deny ephesians
[41:00] how can you deny not forsaking us
[41:03] assembling yourself together
[41:05] and how that you need apostles prophets
[41:07] pastors and teachers and evangelists for
[41:08] the perfecting the saints
[41:12] god don't change his word but the devil
[41:14] does
[41:17] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[41:19] as god gave it and loves and obeys it
[41:20] the other tree is from the seed that is
[41:22] anti the word of god and changes it
[41:25] where it wants to
[41:26] now we're talking about the
[41:27] denominational system also
[41:29] it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas
[41:32] for the living true word exactly as did
[41:35] cain who ended up killing abel
[41:39] but thank god for a prophet he says but
[41:41] fear not little flock
[41:43] stay with the word keep that word
[41:44] between you and the devil
[41:46] eve did not do that and she failed
[41:49] and watch this even and when the church
[41:52] lets down on the word she goes into the
[41:54] depths
[41:55] of the darkness of satan
[41:58] that's pretty powerful all right so now
[42:00] the next thing we want to
[42:02] highlight here is the law of
[42:04] reproduction remember
[42:06] genesis 1 verse 11 this is where satan
[42:09] gets his idea
[42:10] satan doesn't have a seed he can't
[42:11] create a seed but he can take him
[42:13] pervert a seed
[42:15] all right so now god's word is seed
[42:20] god has no other kind of seed amen
[42:24] his seed is his word and so is all these
[42:28] now if you plant
[42:30] that's what you're going to harvest the
[42:32] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[42:35] whose seed is in itself now remember
[42:40] adam at the beginning before the fall
[42:43] had the ability
[42:44] to speak the word right remember brother
[42:46] brown said move
[42:47] cloud move tree move he was he was
[42:50] designing the
[42:51] the whole that's why i said he he was
[42:53] god of the earth
[42:55] and he had god intelligence not serpent
[42:58] intelligence
[43:00] he had god intelligence all right
[43:02] everybody got that
[43:03] yes because every seed bring forth of
[43:06] his kind he came from god so did he
[43:12] but a byproduct though coming out of to
[43:15] help reproduce him but there was nowhere
[43:18] in the original um i'm trying to say
[43:21] this
[43:22] because the whole plan of god is is we
[43:23] came the way we did because he knew that
[43:25] but when he set up that genesis 1 26 man
[43:28] he wanted
[43:29] man to bring forth male and female
[43:31] created he them
[43:32] multiply and replenish the earth that
[43:34] was not by
[43:36] natural seed that was not by a woman and
[43:39] man in copulation or whatever you want
[43:41] to call it coming together
[43:42] sexually that was not in the original
[43:44] plan of god there is no sex in the plan
[43:46] of god
[43:47] but this had to be injected into the
[43:50] plan of god
[43:51] right to show his attribute of healer
[43:54] redeemer savior and all the different
[43:56] things
[43:57] god had to allow it because brother
[43:59] brown told us he said
[44:00] he said god knew when he put them in
[44:02] flesh they'd fall
[44:03] because they can't flesh in spirit
[44:05] because you can't procreate as a spirit
[44:08] sexually but you can spoken word
[44:12] amen is that all right spoken word
[44:15] because remember spoken word is the
[44:17] original seed
[44:19] everybody got that well i said we we may
[44:22] have to say some things and you might
[44:23] have to explain something to your kids
[44:24] but maybe about time you do
[44:27] whose seed is in itself after it's kind
[44:30] josh was in me sister astro was not
[44:33] that's why esther
[44:34] is not the same feature
[44:38] form as josh why because my dna
[44:41] through the bedding ground produced josh
[44:43] well now what the original plan of
[44:45] of god was remember adam had the book of
[44:49] life
[44:49] adam had the book to what
[44:53] reproduce god bring his children
[44:58] through the spoken word not through the
[45:01] other part
[45:02] everybody got that then when hell then
[45:04] when all the
[45:05] fall happened god took the book from
[45:08] adam because
[45:09] now you have to go and you have a
[45:12] natural polluted wound but eve's mind
[45:14] was polluted first you got to keep
[45:16] remembering that
[45:18] adam's mind i mean eve's mind was so
[45:21] polluted first she believed
[45:23] she was doing the right thing yes she
[45:26] still does
[45:27] that's right go over there to listen i
[45:29] i'm not belittling any denomination but
[45:31] going to baptist church today they
[45:34] believe
[45:35] they're worshiping jesus christ
[45:39] when they're really worshiping the
[45:41] system
[45:42] of the devil amen that's how deceived it
[45:46] is
[45:46] right could it happen here too
[45:50] because the framework of the christian
[45:52] church
[45:53] is where satan is at now so he's just
[45:56] he's trying to deceive this bride
[45:59] he's already got them but that's how bad
[46:03] it is see so that's that's the deception
[46:06] eve thought she and the beast were doing
[46:08] what god told them to do
[46:11] or she wouldn't have done it
[46:14] but she was so deceived by his what
[46:17] by his speaking to her by his preaching
[46:20] to her
[46:21] by his soft speaking to eve and
[46:25] eve just thought man this is the way
[46:26] it's supposed to be
[46:28] i'll read it to you in a few minutes
[46:30] where brother brown said
[46:31] she lifted the holy ghost veil
[46:35] to take a lust veil she did it
[46:39] all right because remember we're all
[46:42] free moral agents
[46:44] she knew they were going to fall i mean
[46:46] god knew they were going to fall
[46:48] he knew what she would do but he
[46:50] couldn't stop her from doing it
[46:52] he put everything he could out there he
[46:54] told him don't eat of that tree
[46:56] one thing he told him not to do one
[46:59] thing
[47:01] and she broke that vow
[47:05] of chastity to her husband
[47:08] here first and then the act was just
[47:11] what developed after you get it up here
[47:13] all right we'll talk about that in a
[47:14] minute because there was a question on
[47:15] that all right so the law of
[47:17] reproduction is every seed brings forth
[47:18] of its kind
[47:19] so you and i were born by our mom and
[47:21] daddy bisexual birth
[47:23] and we have a dna that connects us to
[47:25] our parents but when we got born again
[47:27] it's like brother brown said he i'm not
[47:28] the son of charles and elle branham he
[47:30] said i'm a son of god
[47:31] why because his gene had been changed on
[47:34] the inside guy
[47:36] his genetic makeup paul tells us
[47:39] that through regeneration or regening
[47:42] our inside is being changed
[47:45] what into the image of that genesis 1 26
[47:47] man
[47:49] that before there was a fall that's the
[47:50] way we were supposed to come spoken word
[47:52] seed
[47:55] if not how else are you going to make it
[47:58] because there was no sex involved in the
[48:00] human being
[48:02] in the plan of god in the perfect plan
[48:04] of god you know why because what we're
[48:05] doing we're going right back to the
[48:07] garden of eden
[48:08] where brother brown said a man and a
[48:09] woman can hug their self hug
[48:11] each other and it not be a sensation he
[48:13] just proved that by what he was talking
[48:15] to
[48:15] about here on on the tape when he went
[48:17] across the curtain of time
[48:20] they were brothers and sisters all right
[48:23] so that's what but what's got to happen
[48:25] is that's what i was thinking were you
[48:27] thinking this
[48:28] you and i are involved in what he went
[48:30] over there and saw
[48:33] because they're because he's over there
[48:35] now
[48:37] he's over there in that sixth dimension
[48:38] now and you and i
[48:41] are involved in getting him back into
[48:43] this dimension
[48:44] amen if we don't pass away we're going
[48:47] to be right here
[48:50] and we're being right here we're going
[48:51] to call them through that dimension back
[48:53] into this dimension
[48:56] but death has got to be destroyed first
[48:58] right here
[48:59] all right all right so let's go to
[49:00] genesis 1 26
[49:02] and god said let us make man in our own
[49:04] image and after our likeness
[49:06] and let them have dominion over the fish
[49:07] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[49:10] and over the cattle and over all the
[49:11] earth and over every creeping thing that
[49:13] creepeth upon the earth
[49:14] so god created man in his own image and
[49:17] the image of god created in him male and
[49:19] female
[49:21] created he them and god blessed them
[49:24] so he didn't just bless one he blessed
[49:26] both and god blessed them
[49:29] and said be fruitful and multiply and
[49:32] replenish the earth
[49:33] and subdue it and have dominion over the
[49:35] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[49:37] air and over every living thing
[49:38] that moveth upon the earth that's god's
[49:42] children
[49:43] that's the progeny or the genetics of
[49:46] god
[49:47] that's not man that's
[49:51] god man that's god's children and look
[49:55] god had to wait because because adam was
[49:57] the son of god we read it
[49:58] we read it in the in the uh in the
[50:00] genealogy adam was the son of god
[50:03] eve was a daughter of god
[50:07] but then when god had to take that book
[50:08] away from adam so that he couldn't
[50:10] couldn't bring the children forth
[50:12] because what minds got polluted first
[50:15] so he had to wait till the day of
[50:17] pentecost when he come back
[50:19] as jesus christ and lived those three
[50:22] and a half year message and gave it to
[50:23] paul and i mean to peter and james and
[50:25] john
[50:26] and he kept telling them go to jerusalem
[50:29] and wait till you be endued with power
[50:31] from on high because i'll be with you
[50:33] even in you
[50:34] he couldn't say that to abraham he
[50:36] couldn't say that to isaac jacob joseph
[50:39] and all those old testament saints
[50:41] he had to wait all that time 2 000 years
[50:44] so he could bring the bride that he
[50:46] always wanted what born by the breath of
[50:48] god
[50:48] born by the spoken word of god because
[50:50] remember before jesus left the earth
[50:53] he breathed on them and said receive ye
[50:55] the holy ghost now they didn't receive
[50:57] it right then you know that
[50:58] brother brown tells us that was showing
[51:01] what was going to happen on the day of
[51:02] pentecost
[51:04] what a rushing mighty wind was going to
[51:06] come and it was going to what
[51:08] go into the believer not on the believer
[51:10] but inside the believer
[51:11] and see that's what satan can't do
[51:13] that's right satan can anoint you he can
[51:16] get on
[51:16] in your memories and constant effects
[51:19] and imagination
[51:20] but if you're born again he cannot get
[51:21] in your soul
[51:23] your soul is that genesis 1 26 man
[51:26] that's going to reproduce god
[51:28] absolutely not natural children
[51:31] everybody okay with that those of you
[51:34] there to sleep didn't know what i just
[51:36] said genesis 5 verse 1
[51:40] this is the book of the generations of
[51:42] adam and the day that god created man in
[51:44] the likeness of god made him him
[51:46] you know god went i i just brother bob
[51:49] you just gotta go
[51:50] go with me here god's walking through
[51:53] the garden of eden
[51:54] and he finds adam and eve and they're
[51:56] not afraid at this point in time
[51:58] and he says hey son and i believe oh eve
[52:01] just kind of
[52:02] he just kind of looks over and says he
[52:04] looks like you
[52:07] god said yeah he's my son okay
[52:10] that's my son they kind of looked they
[52:12] it was the same genealogy where did adam
[52:15] come
[52:15] come straight from god amen
[52:18] male and female created he them and
[52:20] blessed them
[52:21] and called their name adam remember her
[52:23] name was not evil after the fall
[52:26] in the day when they were created
[52:27] remember adam called her woman the man
[52:29] with the womb
[52:30] all right to reproduce
[52:34] adam so now let's go to number three now
[52:37] i believe that jesus christ is the same
[52:38] yesterday today and forever
[52:40] and i believe that in the beginning god
[52:42] made man in his own image and god is a
[52:44] spirit
[52:45] and god made man spirit man then he made
[52:48] him in the dust of the earth we'll get
[52:50] into genesis 2 7. now believe that man
[52:52] in the beginning well
[52:53] led the animals of the earth like the
[52:55] holy spirit ought to be leaving or
[52:57] leading the church today so let's go to
[53:00] genesis 2 7.
[53:02] we've been through this but this is
[53:03] where god puts man
[53:05] on earth and someone was asking about
[53:07] what how did that creation happen
[53:09] brother madam explains it he said it
[53:11] looks just like
[53:13] adam is standing with roots like tree
[53:15] roots into the ground
[53:17] because he brought him up i mean he's a
[53:18] master potter have you ever not have you
[53:20] ever went to a potter
[53:21] who's doing pottery now somebody these
[53:24] these
[53:24] these uh children of brother bob and
[53:26] sister monica
[53:28] the young ones the smart ones they're uh
[53:31] they're doing pottery
[53:33] and what do you do girls you take
[53:35] something that looks like nothing but a
[53:37] but just a round piece of clay i grew up
[53:41] working in a pottery place so i know
[53:42] they built thousands of them things and
[53:44] i had to put them in the kill and bring
[53:46] them out
[53:47] but they slap that thing on the wheel
[53:48] and what does the master potter do he
[53:50] makes whatever
[53:51] is in his mind he can make that pot
[53:54] right there
[53:55] or whatever he he makes well what about
[53:57] almighty god same thing with adam
[53:59] he threw some potash and 8 16 elements
[54:02] of the earth
[54:02] and he just formed adam out of the dust
[54:04] of the earth that's what the bible says
[54:06] and the lord god formed what do you form
[54:10] it around
[54:11] he formed it around that genesis 1 26
[54:14] man
[54:15] because adam didn't look different when
[54:17] he was a spirit man when he was a flesh
[54:18] man
[54:21] and he wasn't old he didn't start
[54:24] getting old
[54:24] after the fall hello what are we going
[54:28] back to
[54:29] young men and women and the lord god for
[54:32] a man of the dust of the ground
[54:33] and breathed into his nostrils the
[54:35] breath of life and man became a living
[54:37] soul
[54:39] all right then remember he put that
[54:40] genesis 1 26 man inside of adam
[54:43] and give him eternal life according to
[54:45] blasphemous names
[54:47] and the lord god planted a garden
[54:48] eastward of eden and there he put the
[54:49] man whom he informed and out of the
[54:51] ground
[54:52] made he the lord to grow every tree what
[54:54] that is pleasants of sight
[54:56] good for food there's that colon
[54:59] the tree of life also in the midst of
[55:01] the garden and the tree of the knowledge
[55:02] of good and evil now god didn't plant
[55:03] those two trees
[55:06] he was one of them he was the tree of
[55:08] life
[55:09] but he knew that that other guy was down
[55:11] there with him because he kicked him out
[55:13] of heaven so he knew where satan was
[55:14] satan was right there in the garden with
[55:15] him
[55:16] tree of knowledge was good and evil is
[55:17] everybody right with that
[55:20] genesis 2 15 and the lord took the man
[55:23] and put him in the garden of eden to
[55:24] dress and then to keep it
[55:26] and the lord god commanded the man
[55:28] saying
[55:32] of every tree of the garden thou mayest
[55:33] freely eat
[55:35] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[55:37] evil thou shalt not eat of it
[55:40] or what partake of it for in the day now
[55:44] there's a question
[55:47] that we need to answer right here one of
[55:49] the sister another sister asked this
[55:50] question good question
[55:52] because we were talking about god
[55:54] creating light
[55:56] everybody with me even those of you with
[55:59] your eyes closed are you with me
[56:00] i know you're just resting your eyes
[56:06] just don't choke it says thou shalt not
[56:09] eat of it for in the day
[56:10] now the question was is the bible says
[56:13] the evening in the morning was the first
[56:14] day
[56:15] when he created light
[56:18] but not the sun and the moon well now
[56:21] you've got to remember
[56:24] brother branham stops right here
[56:27] for in the day that thou eatest thereof
[56:29] thou shalt surely die now eve didn't die
[56:32] the day she did what she did the 24-hour
[56:36] day
[56:37] because there wasn't that but where did
[56:40] she sin
[56:40] she sinned in the day of the lord
[56:45] because remember brother brown said a
[56:46] thousand years is a day in a day a
[56:48] thousand years
[56:49] several times in the in in the
[56:52] the message brother brown talks about
[56:54] creation was six thousand years
[56:56] not just six days but remember
[57:00] john goes to the isle of patmos and he's
[57:02] on what
[57:03] the lord's day now brother brown said
[57:05] that was not a 24-hour day that wasn't
[57:07] sunday
[57:08] it was the lord's day you know jesus
[57:12] tells us to pray give us this day our
[57:13] daily bread and i don't think of a
[57:15] 24-hour day
[57:16] i think of the day of the lord you and i
[57:18] are in the day of the lord
[57:19] amen all right so that for the day that
[57:22] thou shalt eat thou shalt surely die now
[57:24] what happened
[57:25] why do we have to have a millennium to
[57:27] prove that day
[57:30] thousand year day has been taken up
[57:33] because a day is a thousand years and
[57:34] thousand years a day so to me
[57:37] god when he said the evening in the
[57:38] morning was the first day that could
[57:40] have been a thousand years
[57:43] that's what brother brown said i've been
[57:44] reading it several times he said it
[57:45] could've been a thousand years each day
[57:47] was a thousand years
[57:48] but it set in motion to where you and i
[57:51] well kind of strange the way it happens
[57:54] you know you and i go from morning
[57:59] to night right
[58:02] that's our day from morning you got it
[58:04] from morning
[58:06] tonight and the evening time it shall be
[58:08] light
[58:11] israel takes the evening
[58:15] and the morning as their first day
[58:19] when god gets finished with his day of
[58:21] the gentiles in the evening time about
[58:23] six o'clock in the afternoon
[58:26] he's going to take us out of here and
[58:28] then he's going to be
[58:30] the day with israel the three and a half
[58:33] year day
[58:34] that they're going to get from the
[58:35] evening in the morning is going to be
[58:37] the first day maybe you'll understand
[58:38] that a little bit later
[58:39] but you see how perfect god is he brings
[58:41] the gentiles up and gives us morning and
[58:43] evening gives them
[58:44] evening and morning we have light in the
[58:46] evening time we get ready to get out of
[58:48] here when we do the first thing he does
[58:49] the first day
[58:50] he goes over to israel in their day
[58:54] and what does he do to them he raptures
[58:56] them out
[58:58] from the evening and the morning being
[59:00] the first day
[59:02] so to me that would be
[59:05] god is sho he's setting up days but when
[59:08] and the the question was true
[59:10] there was no moon and stars and
[59:13] sun to divide it but remember he did
[59:16] divide the darkness from the light
[59:18] when he created that light we were
[59:19] talking about that wasn't just a
[59:21] creation it was just a
[59:22] it was just creation happening it was
[59:25] the light of the world it was god
[59:27] almighty creating and atoms bursting and
[59:29] all these different things
[59:31] so the lord god said it's not good that
[59:33] man should be alone i'll make him a help
[59:34] meat for him
[59:36] now the ground the lord god formed every
[59:37] beast of the field and never found the
[59:39] air and brought unto him
[59:40] adam to see what he would call them now
[59:43] remember
[59:45] where's eve where's woman
[59:50] she's right there she's inside of adam
[59:53] everybody got that say amen if this is
[59:56] boring y'all need to go find your ball
[59:58] game
[1:00:00] and you'll be left here when we get out
[1:00:01] of here you can stay in that stadium all
[1:00:03] you want to
[1:00:04] and out of the ground the lord lord
[1:00:06] formed every beast
[1:00:08] of the field never found the air and
[1:00:09] brought them unto adam to see what he
[1:00:11] would call them
[1:00:12] and whatsoever adam called him he never
[1:00:14] had to correct adam
[1:00:16] god never had to create correct jesus
[1:00:19] christ because that's who he was
[1:00:21] but adam was so close to god he had the
[1:00:23] mind of god
[1:00:24] that's why i'm telling you he wasn't
[1:00:26] deceived he knew and had to do what he
[1:00:28] did
[1:00:30] to preserve life just like jesus christ
[1:00:34] did what he had to do he realized in his
[1:00:36] journey here
[1:00:37] that he was going to have to die so that
[1:00:40] his second bride could come out
[1:00:43] so he took what sin with his eyes wide
[1:00:46] open listen he knew the whole plan
[1:00:48] he said before abraham was i am
[1:00:54] everybody okay with that
[1:00:57] he knew he had to die to get that eve
[1:00:59] out of him
[1:01:00] now this adam didn't have to die
[1:01:03] god knew he needed to help me so he took
[1:01:07] her out
[1:01:10] so adam named all the creatures and adam
[1:01:12] gave names all the cattle foul the air
[1:01:13] every beast of the field but for adam
[1:01:15] there was not found and helped me for
[1:01:16] him
[1:01:17] in other words he made male cat female
[1:01:19] cat he made male elephant female
[1:01:21] elephant
[1:01:22] he made male and female
[1:01:25] to reproduce sexually
[1:01:28] but they don't have a carnal mind
[1:01:30] brother brown explains all that marriage
[1:01:32] in divorce he tells you that
[1:01:33] you know we call a dog a for doing
[1:01:36] what she does
[1:01:38] and he says she's got more morals than
[1:01:40] most women because you know what
[1:01:42] they don't know any better they're doing
[1:01:45] what
[1:01:45] nature intended for them to do
[1:01:49] okay that's why brother brown said a
[1:01:51] woman can be worse because she can take
[1:01:53] any time we'll talk about that in a
[1:01:55] minute because that's the deception part
[1:01:57] that come with eve and the lord god
[1:02:00] caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam
[1:02:01] and he slapped and took one of his ribs
[1:02:03] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[1:02:05] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[1:02:07] from man made he a woman
[1:02:09] and brought her unto the man and adam
[1:02:11] said this is
[1:02:12] now bone of my bone
[1:02:16] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[1:02:19] called woman
[1:02:21] because she was taken out of man now
[1:02:22] look
[1:02:24] if we by the new birth are heirs of god
[1:02:26] and joint heirs with christ
[1:02:28] according to romans 8
[1:02:32] she was an heir and a joint heir with
[1:02:34] adam
[1:02:35] coequal before the fall she was not a
[1:02:39] or a whatever you want to call it
[1:02:41] she
[1:02:41] she was pure she had she had
[1:02:44] what she needed to be the wife of
[1:02:48] of adam the man she was to help meet
[1:02:51] to be the wife of adam she had
[1:02:53] everything she needed she had she had
[1:02:54] love
[1:02:55] because we're going to talk about in a
[1:02:56] minute because remember brother brown
[1:02:58] watch what he says
[1:02:58] and you have to put these pieces
[1:03:00] together brother mom tells us he said
[1:03:02] there's agape love
[1:03:04] which is the love of god that has no sex
[1:03:05] involved no lust involved
[1:03:07] but then he said you start rolling down
[1:03:09] he said you go what to that to lust to
[1:03:12] this to that all the way down
[1:03:14] to just rottenness all right see that's
[1:03:16] what satan
[1:03:18] got eve to do if she would have stayed
[1:03:19] in her place
[1:03:21] why you and i we get in our place you
[1:03:24] and i are being females in the bride of
[1:03:26] christ
[1:03:29] we have a lover we have a mate we have a
[1:03:30] husband it's jesus christ
[1:03:33] so let's don't talk about the females
[1:03:35] being some low form because then god can
[1:03:37] talk about you about being
[1:03:38] you being a low form us males right
[1:03:42] because as you treat your wife is how
[1:03:44] god's going to treat you
[1:03:46] that ought to shake your bones and adam
[1:03:49] said this is now bone of my bone and
[1:03:51] flesh of my flesh
[1:03:52] she shall be called woman because she
[1:03:54] was taken out of man
[1:03:56] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:03:57] and mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:03:58] wife and they shall be one flesh
[1:04:00] and they were both naked the man and his
[1:04:02] wife and were not ashamed brother brown
[1:04:04] said they had a holy ghost
[1:04:06] veil over them
[1:04:10] covering them now what it wasn't a veil
[1:04:15] you understand what i mean where did
[1:04:17] that holy ghost veil come from
[1:04:21] right here not a veil because remember
[1:04:25] they substituted that with their own
[1:04:27] veils when they did what they did they
[1:04:28] went and sold fig leaves and here they
[1:04:30] go
[1:04:30] they start covering everything up right
[1:04:34] right they didn't have to before
[1:04:37] and they could touch they could hug i'm
[1:04:39] sure adam and didn't set over and today
[1:04:40] if you stay over there because
[1:04:42] no holy ghost veil they were
[1:04:46] won amen
[1:04:49] they were both naked the man and his
[1:04:50] wife and were not
[1:04:53] all right genesis 3 1
[1:04:56] here we're going through here now we
[1:04:58] know this is the fall
[1:05:00] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:05:03] beast of the field what the lord god had
[1:05:04] made so
[1:05:05] remember this was an upright walking
[1:05:07] creature this was not a snake he was
[1:05:09] made a snake after the fall
[1:05:11] to do what to cover it up because there
[1:05:13] is no snake bone that looks like a man
[1:05:16] there are different ones like brother
[1:05:18] brad said a bear and a different one you
[1:05:20] skin a bear looks like a little young
[1:05:21] child
[1:05:22] but a snake there is nothing in a snake
[1:05:26] that looks like a man's bone that's why
[1:05:27] god hid that
[1:05:28] and made him crawl on the ground now the
[1:05:31] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[1:05:33] of the field which the lord god had made
[1:05:34] and he said unto woman
[1:05:36] yeah god said you shall not even ever
[1:05:37] tree of the garden he's asking her a
[1:05:39] question
[1:05:40] and the woman said unto the serpent let
[1:05:42] me go get my husband
[1:05:44] and i'll have him explain it to you no
[1:05:48] he trapped her right there
[1:05:51] he trapped her right there she answered
[1:05:55] and interpreted the word for herself
[1:05:58] you know what gets us in trouble and now
[1:06:00] what gets the woman the
[1:06:02] church in trouble now instead of going
[1:06:05] to our head ship
[1:06:06] brother brown said she had to come out
[1:06:08] from under headship to do what she did
[1:06:10] same way with you and me and the woman
[1:06:11] said unto the serpent we may eat of the
[1:06:13] fruit of the trees of the garden but of
[1:06:15] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:06:16] midst of the garden
[1:06:18] god has said ye shall not eat of it
[1:06:20] neither shall you
[1:06:21] touch it lest you die
[1:06:25] and the serpent said to the woman ye
[1:06:27] shall
[1:06:29] not surely die
[1:06:32] for god hath now he didn't stop right
[1:06:35] there
[1:06:36] because she's going to throw him another
[1:06:38] question but he brings god into the deal
[1:06:43] he says for god doth no now how does
[1:06:46] satan know that god knows
[1:06:49] because satan's standing there watching
[1:06:51] god through the whole plan
[1:06:53] amen and he knows the knowledge of the
[1:06:55] principles of life he know that god he
[1:06:57] knew that god set in motion that every
[1:06:58] seed was to bring forth of its kind
[1:07:00] and if two if a female dog and a and a
[1:07:03] male dog gets together and
[1:07:05] six months later there's a six or eight
[1:07:07] puppies and then they get together and
[1:07:08] there's six or eight more puppies and
[1:07:09] you do all
[1:07:10] he knew that don't you think adam knew
[1:07:13] that
[1:07:14] adam and eve both knew that they were
[1:07:15] watching it
[1:07:17] but they had a holy ghost veil up here
[1:07:21] to keep them from going from what agape
[1:07:24] love
[1:07:24] to lust all right because brother brown
[1:07:27] said when she took that holy ghost veil
[1:07:29] off
[1:07:30] she took on a lust veil and that's
[1:07:32] what's covering us today folks that's
[1:07:34] why we're all
[1:07:34] we got kids sorry
[1:07:39] we're made to procreate but we were not
[1:07:41] made to procreate sexually we're made to
[1:07:43] pro
[1:07:44] procreate just like what i'm saying
[1:07:46] brother dale
[1:07:47] preaches you catch the seed word of god
[1:07:51] here first drops down to here
[1:07:54] and god births you
[1:07:57] by that seed
[1:08:01] spoken word seed
[1:08:04] and you become that genesis 1 26 man
[1:08:08] satan just didn't realize he thought he
[1:08:10] had stopped the whole plan when he did
[1:08:12] what he did with eve
[1:08:13] but god's like i knew you were going to
[1:08:16] do that
[1:08:18] so here i got a little provision over
[1:08:20] here called grace
[1:08:24] i got a provision here called the lamb
[1:08:27] and satan believe it or not i'm going to
[1:08:29] go die for them people you won't but i
[1:08:31] will
[1:08:33] i'll go die for him and satan's like i
[1:08:35] ain't dying for him
[1:08:37] and that what he said when he come up to
[1:08:38] the at to be the the
[1:08:40] near kinsman and the boaz and ruth and
[1:08:43] he's oh yeah i'll do it and then boaz
[1:08:44] said well you got to take all this other
[1:08:46] and he said no i don't want to do that
[1:08:49] in other words you got to go to calvary
[1:08:51] satan you got to give your life
[1:08:53] he's like nah ain't going to do it
[1:08:57] what a beautiful picture though what god
[1:08:59] did
[1:09:01] it's a perfect plan it was an almighty
[1:09:04] god that's
[1:09:04] only one that could come up with that
[1:09:06] plan is perfect it can't be changed
[1:09:10] it's like i said before this 66 books of
[1:09:13] the bible and those 1100 sermons that we
[1:09:15] listen to
[1:09:16] is god speaking to us perfect
[1:09:20] it cannot be changed
[1:09:24] man has changed it is what's got us in
[1:09:26] this trouble
[1:09:28] for god doesn't know that in the day you
[1:09:31] eat thereof or partake
[1:09:34] then you're what she can see
[1:09:37] she can see already she's seeing him
[1:09:40] standing there
[1:09:41] the beast talking to her then your eyes
[1:09:46] what eyes this eye
[1:09:49] not these eyes this eye we
[1:09:52] sing open the eyes of my heart lord
[1:09:56] are we blind yes spiritually we could be
[1:09:59] blind
[1:10:00] so what happened is when he said you
[1:10:02] should not surely die and when she
[1:10:04] started partaking of that
[1:10:05] remember what i'll read you you meant
[1:10:07] she pulled that holy ghost veil off
[1:10:09] stepped into a lust veil and she thought
[1:10:11] she was doing exactly what god told her
[1:10:13] to do
[1:10:15] still brother brown says she still
[1:10:17] thinks she's doing the right thing
[1:10:19] after 6 000 or more years she still
[1:10:22] thinks she's doing the right thing
[1:10:24] that other eve i'll read it to you a
[1:10:28] minute
[1:10:30] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[1:10:33] shall be as gods
[1:10:35] knowing good and evil
[1:10:39] and when the woman saw that the tree
[1:10:42] and boy you can get into this because i
[1:10:45] even brother branham in
[1:10:46] marriage and divorce
[1:10:50] if you're a man and a woman today that's
[1:10:52] been married you understand what all
[1:10:53] these
[1:10:54] symbols are a snake is a phallic symbol
[1:10:57] a tree is the same thing you understand
[1:10:59] what i'm saying
[1:10:59] so this is why moses is when he's
[1:11:03] writing this he's not going to write
[1:11:04] this
[1:11:07] in a form to where everybody's going to
[1:11:09] understand it he's got to write it in
[1:11:11] the form so that me and you can
[1:11:12] understand it
[1:11:13] the spiritual application of it but we
[1:11:15] know what happened literally
[1:11:17] yes and listen i want to stop right here
[1:11:20] just real quick
[1:11:23] because remember she was deceived listen
[1:11:26] this
[1:11:26] and and i hope i don't offend no sister
[1:11:28] in this church
[1:11:29] but when you start asking questions
[1:11:33] and you ask them like it's kind of like
[1:11:36] you think that the
[1:11:37] the beast and eve
[1:11:43] it was some kind of
[1:11:46] and i don't want to say it like the
[1:11:47] world would say it a romp in the hay
[1:11:49] you understand what i'm saying it was
[1:11:51] not some sensual
[1:11:54] um no she thought she was doing what god
[1:11:58] said to do and then it just happened
[1:12:03] sure it was a sexual affair sure it was
[1:12:05] something that threw us all into chaos
[1:12:07] but it wasn't some lustful now we know
[1:12:10] it worked its way into that
[1:12:13] but she thought she was doing the right
[1:12:14] thing like i said it wasn't some dirty
[1:12:16] something and that's what i hope
[1:12:18] we all as brothers and sisters when she
[1:12:21] was deceived
[1:12:22] that meant she thought she was doing the
[1:12:23] right thing
[1:12:25] having relations with a animal
[1:12:29] look how deceiving that is with an
[1:12:33] animal
[1:12:35] and then she's so deceived she goes to
[1:12:37] adam and says
[1:12:38] i got this new revelation
[1:12:42] and it wasn't some like i said before
[1:12:45] it's not it wasn't some
[1:12:47] lust-filled encounter
[1:12:51] he thought she was doing what god said
[1:12:53] to do so she laid down and did exactly
[1:12:55] what she's been watching the
[1:12:57] animals do thinking that that would
[1:13:00] produce
[1:13:02] what god said you know what the
[1:13:04] denominations are doing and what anybody
[1:13:06] that's deceived is doing they're trying
[1:13:07] to do the right thing because we're
[1:13:08] going to read it right here in a minute
[1:13:10] now look when the woman saw the tree was
[1:13:12] good for food
[1:13:14] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[1:13:16] that it was pleasant to the eye now look
[1:13:18] that word up pleasant
[1:13:19] that pleasant word pleasant means
[1:13:22] lustful
[1:13:25] because remember she's getting red she's
[1:13:26] taking that veil off
[1:13:30] all right because i'm going to tell you
[1:13:32] something
[1:13:34] when she approached adam and told adam
[1:13:37] what she did
[1:13:39] most of us
[1:13:43] would have never touched our wife ever
[1:13:46] again
[1:13:48] amen you understand what i'm saying
[1:13:49] adults
[1:13:52] but why did he do it he still had agape
[1:13:54] love
[1:13:56] it couldn't have been lustful love that
[1:13:59] told him to do what he did no because
[1:14:01] remember
[1:14:02] he wasn't deceived he knew what he was
[1:14:05] doing
[1:14:07] see jesus christ didn't come down here
[1:14:09] with a lustful veil he came down here
[1:14:11] with a holy ghost vow
[1:14:13] which kept him pure he knew though that
[1:14:16] brother brown says that
[1:14:17] jesus christ was so human he could have
[1:14:19] had children
[1:14:21] amen but that's not why he came he came
[1:14:24] to destroy that
[1:14:25] yes amen and to bring a bride by the
[1:14:28] spoken word of god go to jerusalem
[1:14:30] and i'm going to give you the holy ghost
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:36] she took of the fruit thereof in other
[1:14:38] words she did the act
[1:14:39] and did eat what did partake and also
[1:14:43] gay and also unto her husband with her
[1:14:45] and he did eat
[1:14:47] and here was one of the questions one of
[1:14:48] the questions is is when the woman
[1:14:50] partook with the beast why wasn't her
[1:14:52] eyes open first
[1:14:54] she was deceived
[1:14:57] her eyes were not open i don't believe
[1:14:59] until she took it to adam and adam said
[1:15:02] what did you do this is what you done
[1:15:08] and then i believe adam had to step out
[1:15:10] with her
[1:15:12] what brother brown said i'll prove it to
[1:15:13] you right here in just a second i'll
[1:15:14] read it
[1:15:16] and the eyes of them both were open and
[1:15:19] they knew that they were naked
[1:15:22] and they sowed fig leaves together and
[1:15:25] made themselves aprons
[1:15:27] and brother brown tells us in this end
[1:15:29] time now look at brother branham here he
[1:15:31] is in the 60s
[1:15:34] women wear shorts to here down maybe
[1:15:36] they enter them little
[1:15:37] knickerbocker things or whatever pedal
[1:15:39] pushers he calls them
[1:15:40] and their bikinis had enough clothes on
[1:15:42] them to be
[1:15:44] halfway modest look at today
[1:15:48] but brother brown said it's a lush
[1:15:50] spirit that tells them women to put on
[1:15:52] shorts and she can go out there and cut
[1:15:54] grass in her shorts and her tank top or
[1:15:56] whatever it was
[1:15:57] and she thinks she's okay
[1:16:00] so what's the same thing it's the same
[1:16:02] devil
[1:16:04] what do you do in the beginning he said
[1:16:06] eve you're fine
[1:16:08] this is producing the plan of god
[1:16:11] he told you to multiply and replenish
[1:16:13] the earth i heard him
[1:16:16] if they're doing it in the animal
[1:16:18] kingdom
[1:16:19] why not you oh and by the way i'm here
[1:16:23] to help
[1:16:24] and that's what the devil is he shows up
[1:16:26] and he says i'm here to help
[1:16:28] i'll help you yeah right you better stay
[1:16:30] away from that slicker brother i'm
[1:16:31] saying
[1:16:32] but it's that lush veil that's on us
[1:16:34] again showing us
[1:16:36] it's like what brother brown said he
[1:16:38] said you think you've got the holy ghost
[1:16:39] and you can take off more clothes
[1:16:44] he said getting the baptism of the holy
[1:16:45] ghost shows that you are were naked
[1:16:47] and that you need to put on clothes amen
[1:16:51] the eyes of them both were open and they
[1:16:53] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[1:16:54] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:16:57] aprons let's go to first timothy 2 verse
[1:16:59] 12 to prove our point
[1:17:01] but i suffered not a woman to teach nor
[1:17:02] worship authority over the man to
[1:17:05] be in silence now why that was set up
[1:17:07] because
[1:17:08] in genesis 3 god had to put it where
[1:17:12] man was the head over the woman before
[1:17:15] the fall remember they were equal
[1:17:17] but because of what she did because of
[1:17:20] her transgression
[1:17:24] but i suffered not a woman to teach
[1:17:25] worship authority over the man
[1:17:27] but to be in silence for adam was first
[1:17:30] formed
[1:17:31] then eve and adam was not deceived
[1:17:35] brother brown said he went into it i'll
[1:17:36] read it that went into it white with his
[1:17:38] eyes
[1:17:38] wide open and adam was not deceived but
[1:17:43] the woman being
[1:17:44] deceived was in the transgression now
[1:17:47] let's look at that word to see
[1:17:49] the word deceived means look watch this
[1:17:51] to cause
[1:17:52] to accept now what did eve accept
[1:17:56] she accepted a seed from the serpent
[1:18:00] before they did the natural act she
[1:18:02] accepted a seed in here
[1:18:06] that she was right
[1:18:09] so then the other part just happened
[1:18:11] behind it
[1:18:14] and this is where i want you sisters and
[1:18:15] brothers i want you to realize this
[1:18:17] those of you that are adults
[1:18:19] where does everything begin right here
[1:18:23] right here even in your husband and wife
[1:18:26] relationship it starts right here
[1:18:30] amen right here is where it all begins
[1:18:32] right here
[1:18:33] all right to cause to accept as true or
[1:18:37] valid what is false or invalid
[1:18:40] so she accepted as truth
[1:18:44] what the b said when
[1:18:47] in originality it was false or invalid
[1:18:52] so that's what deception or deceive
[1:18:54] means
[1:18:55] and remember
[1:18:59] she had to accept it so to me and you
[1:19:03] god's not listen i love and and i keep
[1:19:06] bringing it out i want you to realize
[1:19:07] this brother brown said
[1:19:08] the holy ghost is a timid spirit
[1:19:13] remember i've said many times before you
[1:19:15] know if it was me if i was the holy
[1:19:17] spirit and you had a door closed you
[1:19:18] know i'd be over there kicking the thing
[1:19:19] down
[1:19:20] you know why because that's my human i
[1:19:22] want to know what's behind behind what
[1:19:23] you're hiding
[1:19:24] but brother brown said he'll walk into
[1:19:26] your house remember the
[1:19:27] doors and doors and this is after the
[1:19:30] new birth this is after you get the new
[1:19:32] birth he
[1:19:33] you let him in your house but you got
[1:19:36] this door closed
[1:19:37] you got this door closed and he's not
[1:19:39] going to go over there and even snoop
[1:19:42] he's just going to politely say can i go
[1:19:44] in that door
[1:19:46] and you can say that's what that statue
[1:19:48] of a perfect man is folks that's
[1:19:50] that's the doors that we have to work on
[1:19:52] and god's not going to kick the door
[1:19:54] down
[1:19:55] god didn't kick the door down in the
[1:19:57] garden of eden right
[1:19:59] first thing you've done he come down
[1:20:00] there looking for adam he can come down
[1:20:02] there and just wipe the whole thing off
[1:20:04] and start again
[1:20:05] did he no he knew what they were going
[1:20:07] to do
[1:20:09] to cause to accept as true or valid
[1:20:12] what is false are invalid so
[1:20:16] eve in everything she had
[1:20:19] she totally denied whatever that wasn't
[1:20:22] deep down inside of her
[1:20:24] and produced what she did with the beast
[1:20:28] everybody got that
[1:20:32] pretty deceiving isn't it so that was
[1:20:35] the question when the woman partook with
[1:20:36] the beast why was
[1:20:37] her eyes open then when she gave to adam
[1:20:40] both were open
[1:20:42] she as soon when she walked up and told
[1:20:44] adam what she did and this was her new
[1:20:46] revelation i'll read it to you in a
[1:20:47] minute where brother brown says
[1:20:49] she brought a new revelation to adam
[1:20:52] well see adam
[1:20:57] looked at her and said what have you
[1:20:59] done
[1:21:00] because see god asked adam what he done
[1:21:04] so he asked his wife what have you done
[1:21:06] he said oh i got
[1:21:07] i'm i'm i'm going to produce what you're
[1:21:10] supposed to be producing
[1:21:14] i'm trying to get i'm trying to get this
[1:21:15] genesis 1 26 thing started here
[1:21:18] uh that beast preached me a sermon and i
[1:21:22] and he said oh my lord
[1:21:25] oh my lord what have you done listen to
[1:21:27] this number four position of a believer
[1:21:29] in christ
[1:21:31] but the misunderstanding was they
[1:21:33] thought that i said that adam never
[1:21:35] sinned but adam did sin
[1:21:37] because remember eve was deceived adam
[1:21:40] knew what he was doing
[1:21:43] but he did it with his eyes wide open
[1:21:46] and instead in timothy 3 it is said that
[1:21:49] adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:21:50] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:21:52] see
[1:21:53] eve actually thought she was
[1:21:57] right but satan deceived her
[1:22:01] but he didn't deceive adam he knew it
[1:22:04] was wrong
[1:22:04] but because of the love for his wife
[1:22:07] that's not filial love
[1:22:11] that's agape love knowing that that
[1:22:13] woman that even though she did what she
[1:22:15] did because you know what jesus christ
[1:22:16] didn't
[1:22:19] he saved us he didn't destroy us he
[1:22:23] saved us
[1:22:25] let us come this way but he saved us
[1:22:27] same way
[1:22:28] that's why he couldn't destroy eve
[1:22:31] he knew it was wrong but because of the
[1:22:33] love for his wife what that way
[1:22:35] back that agape love christ remember
[1:22:39] first adam is what
[1:22:40] the first christ or the first first
[1:22:42] person first adam the bible says
[1:22:45] but he was earthy why because he had to
[1:22:48] come down here and put him in flesh
[1:22:50] but he didn't deceive adam he knew it
[1:22:52] was wrong but because of the love for
[1:22:53] his wife
[1:22:54] he represented himself with that sin
[1:22:57] that she did
[1:22:59] and was condemned by the same and cast
[1:23:02] out of the garden of eden
[1:23:03] my thoughts on that is is adam literally
[1:23:06] thought he could save eve
[1:23:07] like christ saved the bride because he
[1:23:09] had that same
[1:23:11] he had that same thought process as god
[1:23:14] did
[1:23:14] but remember he was a human being he was
[1:23:18] an almighty god he couldn't
[1:23:19] transfer his life to save his wife
[1:23:24] jesus christ can transfer his life
[1:23:27] because he's god almighty
[1:23:29] he is that genesis 1 26 man okay
[1:23:32] we're just a part of that so he could
[1:23:35] fulfill it but adam couldn't that's why
[1:23:36] brother brown said adam went out with
[1:23:38] leave but couldn't come back
[1:23:40] he had to partake of the sin of eve but
[1:23:42] he couldn't take her back in the garden
[1:23:44] of eden
[1:23:46] but christ can
[1:23:49] and he wasn't deceived either amen
[1:23:53] so watch and cast out of the garden of
[1:23:56] eden
[1:23:57] listen i wrote myself a note we'll read
[1:23:59] that leave it right there
[1:24:00] but remember adam was not a common man
[1:24:03] he was a ruler of the earth he had
[1:24:06] god-like qualities
[1:24:09] i believe he knew that what is put into
[1:24:12] motion
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:14] he couldn't reverse because god said
[1:24:17] whatever seed was planted that
[1:24:18] seed would bring forth of its kind right
[1:24:21] he knew that she was pregnanted by the
[1:24:23] beast and he couldn't reverse that
[1:24:27] and that's why he went ahead and did
[1:24:29] what he did with her to make sure that
[1:24:31] his genealogy
[1:24:32] was con would continue down the line
[1:24:35] because he was son of god
[1:24:37] he knew if he didn't do something that
[1:24:39] it would just be
[1:24:41] a beast and he'd have to destroy her but
[1:24:43] he what he took her
[1:24:44] but remember it wasn't never
[1:24:47] never never was adam's natural seed
[1:24:51] ever to come out of his body
[1:24:58] sorry to be plain but that wasn't the
[1:25:01] original plan
[1:25:03] it was spoken word but when he did what
[1:25:06] he did he knew the same principles of
[1:25:08] life as the same thing as
[1:25:10] as satan did he knew what he had that he
[1:25:12] could use
[1:25:15] but look what's the thing brother
[1:25:17] branham god is looking and trying and
[1:25:19] moving and begging and persuading to
[1:25:20] find a little heart
[1:25:21] that he can come into and coo and make
[1:25:23] love to
[1:25:24] remember how he took adam and eve before
[1:25:26] the world before sin came into the world
[1:25:28] look at adam what a beautiful type adam
[1:25:30] and eve was the type of christ in the
[1:25:32] church
[1:25:33] have i got that now remember
[1:25:36] eve did not sin adam sinned
[1:25:40] adam's one that sold us out folks that's
[1:25:43] why the second adam had to
[1:25:44] bring us back now remember eve did not
[1:25:48] sin
[1:25:48] adam's sin that's right not eve adam's
[1:25:51] sin
[1:25:52] not eve she was the one who did the act
[1:25:54] but adam done the sinning
[1:25:57] whew
[1:26:00] i'm reading quotes the woman was
[1:26:04] deceived keep going
[1:26:07] the bible said she was deceived she
[1:26:10] thought she was right now keep that in
[1:26:12] your mind
[1:26:12] sisters brothers she thought
[1:26:16] she was doing exactly what god told him
[1:26:18] to do and i'll read you a quote in a
[1:26:22] minute where he says she still is now
[1:26:25] it's not in this one i don't think
[1:26:27] she thought she was right but adam
[1:26:29] knowed it was wrong
[1:26:30] and now look when adam saw eve had
[1:26:32] sinned and had done wrong
[1:26:34] adam walked right out not deceived but
[1:26:37] with both
[1:26:38] eyes open but he so loved eve
[1:26:42] agape love not filial though because
[1:26:44] what happened when they take the holy
[1:26:45] ghost bell off
[1:26:46] it comes into filial love agape love is
[1:26:49] what come into you at the new birth
[1:26:52] inside you adam walks right out
[1:26:56] but he so loved eve that he took her
[1:26:57] place in death with her
[1:26:59] and walked out with her you know that
[1:27:03] number six here it is right here
[1:27:06] now women must bring forth this germ of
[1:27:08] life hurry man together by connection we
[1:27:11] won't go into that because you certainly
[1:27:12] disagree with me it's talking about what
[1:27:14] happened in the garden
[1:27:15] but it wasn't apples they taken in the
[1:27:16] garden of eden so then when
[1:27:18] when they did let it be what it made
[1:27:21] bless brother brown's heart
[1:27:22] he knew that he was discerning people
[1:27:24] thinking it was still apples you know he
[1:27:25] said you believe whatever you want to
[1:27:28] but it wasn't apples they'd taken in the
[1:27:30] garden so then when the
[1:27:32] when they did let it be what it may
[1:27:34] woman's sin
[1:27:35] man never sinned and then he corrects
[1:27:37] himself i mean
[1:27:38] man sin woman never sinned the woman was
[1:27:41] actually deceived
[1:27:43] adam was not deceived he knowed what he
[1:27:44] was doing
[1:27:46] eve actually thought she was right how
[1:27:48] many times we got to say that
[1:27:50] she was getting some new light
[1:27:54] because remember satan is an angel of
[1:27:56] light transformed into an agent
[1:27:58] agent or an angel of life that satan was
[1:28:00] giving her
[1:28:01] he's still giving her new
[1:28:05] light he's still
[1:28:08] giving her new light stay with the bible
[1:28:12] that's it the same i wrote myself a note
[1:28:15] it's the same sermons that's preached in
[1:28:17] the garden is being preached today
[1:28:20] by the devil and god puts his word out
[1:28:24] there and he said
[1:28:24] believe what i said amen kind of simple
[1:28:28] to believe that
[1:28:30] but it's kind of profound look at number
[1:28:32] seven here
[1:28:33] it's kind of long but i'm going to read
[1:28:35] it i was only 11 39. we're good
[1:28:37] lord i thought this would take a while
[1:28:39] notice
[1:28:40] she pulled off the holy veil to see what
[1:28:43] sex
[1:28:43] really was now this is satan's eating
[1:28:45] 1965.
[1:28:46] compare that what lust really would do
[1:28:50] she pulled the veil from off her eyes
[1:28:52] the holy thing that god had put
[1:28:54] over her eyes she wanted knowledge
[1:28:58] to know what it was all about so she
[1:29:01] pulled the veil
[1:29:02] off to see what it was all about
[1:29:05] that's why a woman can be deceived more
[1:29:07] than the man her feelings takes her
[1:29:09] toward that
[1:29:10] sorry she listened to the devil
[1:29:15] and noticed what a place it put her in
[1:29:18] they had done the same thing
[1:29:20] in each age thereafter boy he's coming
[1:29:22] up now in the church ages
[1:29:24] they have done the same thing in each
[1:29:26] age thereafter always taken the
[1:29:28] intellectual side
[1:29:30] and has now built a kingdom of satan
[1:29:33] knowledge
[1:29:34] his seed that he sowed and has taken the
[1:29:37] world to be an eden
[1:29:40] of death keep going now notice now look
[1:29:43] at revelations 3 the loudest in church
[1:29:45] age
[1:29:46] you think it in your mind now notice she
[1:29:49] eve is satan's queen see satan the
[1:29:53] serpent
[1:29:53] got to eve before adam got to her see
[1:29:56] that's right
[1:29:57] so he beguiled her see so satan the
[1:30:00] serpent was the husband of eve before
[1:30:02] adam
[1:30:03] ever knew everybody understand that see
[1:30:06] he beguiled her the bible said he did
[1:30:08] and she knowed that she was naked
[1:30:10] then now look at the the layout of
[1:30:14] seeing church age she
[1:30:15] eve is sitting as satan's queen what the
[1:30:18] whole world's being deceived i'm talking
[1:30:19] about the whole church world
[1:30:21] i'm not talking about the drunks and i'm
[1:30:22] talking about the church world
[1:30:24] it's being deceived by that same lie
[1:30:28] she is rich worldly goods blind naked
[1:30:31] again and don't know it just like it was
[1:30:32] in god's eden but
[1:30:34] now not because the holy veil is over
[1:30:37] her face but the lust veil
[1:30:39] that she took off god's holy veil and
[1:30:41] put on a veil of knowledge for lust
[1:30:44] and now she has a lust veil that she is
[1:30:46] blind to it
[1:30:48] being sin she's blind to it being sin
[1:30:52] because listen if you get the truth told
[1:30:55] to you
[1:30:57] of water baptism of the trinitarian doc
[1:31:00] all these different things if you're
[1:31:01] told that
[1:31:02] and you deny it then what are you you're
[1:31:05] blind
[1:31:06] to that sin that you're in that's why
[1:31:08] we're all blinded
[1:31:10] we were blinded by what satan's lie she
[1:31:13] is naked on the street
[1:31:15] and don't know it see
[1:31:18] naked and don't know it now look at
[1:31:20] genesis 4
[1:31:22] verse 1. look how deceived
[1:31:26] eve was even after all this
[1:31:31] and adam knew eve his wife and she
[1:31:32] conceived and bear cain and said i have
[1:31:34] gotten a man
[1:31:36] from the lord she still thought that
[1:31:38] plan was going to work somehow
[1:31:41] she still thought and we know that god
[1:31:42] had to give cain life
[1:31:44] because of what because of what he said
[1:31:46] in genesis
[1:31:48] 1 verse 4 or 5 and there where said
[1:31:50] every seed has to bring forth of its
[1:31:51] kind
[1:31:52] all right so let's stop right there and
[1:31:55] i've got some more quotes that you don't
[1:31:56] have
[1:31:57] but i want to read them to you and this
[1:31:59] will help
[1:32:01] because as many people
[1:32:05] in this message of pull-up number a now
[1:32:06] you don't have them in yours but you
[1:32:08] just have to read them off of here
[1:32:12] watch what happened now look there's a
[1:32:15] lot of people
[1:32:16] in this message believe that adam
[1:32:20] had to have sex with eve to save her
[1:32:25] now it's it's well known everybody most
[1:32:27] of the ministers are shaking their head
[1:32:28] we know who preaches it
[1:32:31] but to me that's not right adam's
[1:32:34] natural seed is what destroyed this
[1:32:37] world
[1:32:38] not made it better he couldn't save eve
[1:32:42] that was the problem
[1:32:45] adam saved no one adam couldn't save
[1:32:48] himself
[1:32:50] they still needed a lamb abel needed a
[1:32:52] lamb even
[1:32:53] righteous abel the bible says in genesis
[1:32:55] i mean in hebrews 11
[1:32:57] abel's righteousness though
[1:33:01] was that lamb that he took for a
[1:33:04] sacrifice
[1:33:05] amen let's read this right here just
[1:33:08] couldn't wait
[1:33:09] so the sperm of eve never happened
[1:33:12] hybrid to satan's lie
[1:33:14] his lovely bride become polluted and so
[1:33:16] has crossbride
[1:33:18] the bride what made her become polluted
[1:33:21] adam's bride
[1:33:22] now question because she never stayed
[1:33:24] with god's word god's word was not to
[1:33:26] create sexually it was to create by the
[1:33:27] spoken word of god
[1:33:29] okay has everybody got that i asked now
[1:33:32] if it's not so don't say it
[1:33:34] but if it's so say it the reason that
[1:33:36] god's the reason that adam's bride
[1:33:38] there's the three adam christ
[1:33:42] god the reason that adam's bride never
[1:33:45] did
[1:33:45] bear right the life child
[1:33:52] it's because she disbelieved god's word
[1:33:55] she took in other words she didn't take
[1:33:56] on a spiritual atmosphere she took on a
[1:33:59] natural atmosphere and took on a natural
[1:34:01] seed
[1:34:02] everybody got that right but now what
[1:34:04] did what was that natural seed one was
[1:34:06] from the beast and one was from adam
[1:34:09] they both were born dead okay
[1:34:12] is that right say amen congregation says
[1:34:14] amen the reason that jehovah's wife
[1:34:16] was put away what in the old testament
[1:34:19] god had a bride called israel
[1:34:25] all right the reason that jehovah's wife
[1:34:27] put was put away what
[1:34:30] she went out what not prostituting so
[1:34:33] much her body
[1:34:35] children of israel didn't just become a
[1:34:36] bunch of natural
[1:34:40] it was what they did spiritually they
[1:34:43] went after idols
[1:34:44] they went after all these different
[1:34:46] things that god told them not to do
[1:34:48] they went after him and what did he do
[1:34:50] he put her away
[1:34:52] the reason that jehovah's wife was put
[1:34:53] away or his bride was because that she
[1:34:56] rejected god's word
[1:34:57] the prophet that right tell amen the
[1:35:00] reason that christ's bride is put away
[1:35:02] in divorcement nicaea
[1:35:06] this is getting up to us now it's
[1:35:09] because that she rejected the word of
[1:35:11] god
[1:35:12] what took on a trinity took on a water
[1:35:14] baptism that was false
[1:35:16] like eve did like the rest of them did
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:20] exactly now i'm just reading all
[1:35:25] all polluted their husband couldn't get
[1:35:27] to them
[1:35:29] they was already pregnanted before their
[1:35:31] husband got to them
[1:35:33] oh god if that ain't a pitiful sight
[1:35:36] think of a young man coming to a woman
[1:35:37] and find her with seed of some other man
[1:35:39] in her what a thing
[1:35:40] that's what god has done that's what
[1:35:43] adam done
[1:35:45] that's what christ has done so let's
[1:35:47] read number b
[1:35:48] this is in the breach
[1:35:51] now if if adam's seed was just some of
[1:35:53] this wonderful thing
[1:35:55] let's read what the prophet said because
[1:35:58] remember
[1:35:58] nowhere in adam's experience was he
[1:36:02] supposed to have
[1:36:03] uh natural relations with eve
[1:36:07] right i mean isn't that true
[1:36:10] because that's what got him in trouble
[1:36:12] you got to do the reverse
[1:36:15] now couldn't we stop here just a minute
[1:36:16] and get our real sermon oh then if the
[1:36:19] blood has cleansed it back what about
[1:36:20] now
[1:36:21] look what that son of god the second
[1:36:23] adam did said the works that i do shall
[1:36:26] you do also
[1:36:26] see adam lost his inheritance
[1:36:31] the earth now it passed from his hand to
[1:36:34] the one he sold it out to
[1:36:35] satan because remember this is the god
[1:36:37] of the evil age the siblings he sold his
[1:36:39] faith in god
[1:36:41] to satan's reasoning therefore his
[1:36:43] eternal life his right to the tree of
[1:36:44] life his right to the earth belonged to
[1:36:46] him
[1:36:47] and he forfeited it every bit to the
[1:36:48] hands of satan now i want to explain
[1:36:50] something right here
[1:36:52] he didn't lose the eternal life that was
[1:36:53] in his soul
[1:36:55] he was the son of god he comes straight
[1:36:57] from god
[1:36:58] he was part of that genesis 1 26 man it
[1:37:01] was just that his
[1:37:02] now his body had to die and just think
[1:37:05] how strong though that body is you read
[1:37:07] how many they
[1:37:08] live 900 can you imagine living sister
[1:37:10] cletus 91
[1:37:11] 2 1 8 no 7 35
[1:37:14] but could you imagine living 900 years
[1:37:17] 900 years
[1:37:19] that's how strong their body was that
[1:37:21] god give them in the garden give them
[1:37:23] good food to eat even though he cursed
[1:37:24] the ground
[1:37:26] 969 years can you go back 900 years
[1:37:29] you'd be back in what
[1:37:32] good grief you'd be back in the 1400
[1:37:35] you'd be back in 1100
[1:37:37] a.d could you imagine living from there
[1:37:39] till today
[1:37:41] i mean even my dad at 80 years old he's
[1:37:43] seen go from a horse in a buggy
[1:37:45] to a to an astronaut in his life just in
[1:37:48] his short lifetime what do you think
[1:37:49] about that
[1:37:51] but they eventually died yes
[1:37:55] why because they denied what was in the
[1:37:57] garden of eden
[1:37:59] they denied the tree of life look
[1:38:01] therefore his eternal life his right to
[1:38:03] the tree of life his right to the earth
[1:38:05] belonged to him
[1:38:06] and he forfeited every bit to the hands
[1:38:08] of satan he passed it from his hand
[1:38:10] to satan and we're going to read that
[1:38:13] next sunday in genesis 3. we'll actually
[1:38:15] start with genesis
[1:38:16] 3 again where god condemned all this but
[1:38:18] i had to cover this because of the
[1:38:20] deception
[1:38:21] that i want us to be aware that you know
[1:38:23] what you and i are still deceived until
[1:38:25] we get to the body change
[1:38:29] there's a small part of deception
[1:38:30] there's a part of us in us right now
[1:38:32] sorry that's being worked out
[1:38:36] out of us that we're just gonna have to
[1:38:39] die
[1:38:40] we can't make it we can't do this i'm
[1:38:42] getting old
[1:38:43] abraham never had that in his vocabulary
[1:38:47] abraham said god you promised it you're
[1:38:49] going to have to make it come to pass
[1:38:51] that's what we got to depend on we can't
[1:38:52] depend on yeah we depend on doctors we
[1:38:54] depend on taking vitamins we depend on
[1:38:56] losing weight we depend on doing these
[1:38:58] things
[1:38:58] but you know what you can lose in one
[1:39:01] second
[1:39:03] but you can't lose your eternal life if
[1:39:04] you get it inside here
[1:39:07] you're just as eternal as god is
[1:39:09] therefore now it has been watch this it
[1:39:11] returned
[1:39:12] and has been polluted now look the seed
[1:39:15] of adam
[1:39:16] natural the natural the seed of adam has
[1:39:20] destroyed the inheritance
[1:39:22] that adam should have had when he did
[1:39:25] what he did with eve to take on her sin
[1:39:28] he destroyed brother brown see he
[1:39:29] destroyed everything
[1:39:33] that adam should have had that's the
[1:39:35] earth that's right the seed of adam
[1:39:37] let's go to number c and then we'll be
[1:39:38] done
[1:39:40] prophet god this is still in the breach
[1:39:41] this is paragraph 111 now what happened
[1:39:44] the polluted seed of adam natural
[1:39:51] has polluted and absolutely destroyed
[1:39:54] this land
[1:39:56] so we put all of that on eve oh at least
[1:39:58] if i eat was this eve with this big
[1:40:00] well you know what
[1:40:02] eve was deceived she thought she was
[1:40:04] doing the exact thing god
[1:40:06] said and the prophet of god says she's
[1:40:10] still deceived today
[1:40:12] look how strong that deception is but it
[1:40:15] was the polluted seed of adam when he
[1:40:17] did what he wasn't supposed to do
[1:40:19] to bring children forth sure adam was i
[1:40:22] mean eve was a part of it because
[1:40:24] remember they were one
[1:40:26] that's why i believe that agape love
[1:40:28] took over adam
[1:40:31] so he couldn't kill her he loved her so
[1:40:34] much i just read you the quote he loved
[1:40:36] her so much he couldn't see or destroyed
[1:40:37] so he had to keep going in the plan of
[1:40:39] god
[1:40:40] to keep his seed line going because
[1:40:43] there was going to be a natural bee seed
[1:40:46] and we'll talk about that next sunday
[1:40:48] there's a natural bee
[1:40:49] seed that went out and then there was a
[1:40:50] natural seed of adam that went out in
[1:40:52] the beginning
[1:40:53] no doubt cain was not from adam
[1:40:56] cain was from the wicked one abel was
[1:40:58] from adam seth was from adam
[1:41:01] and everything else cain was
[1:41:04] basically by himself he didn't have a
[1:41:06] daddy he didn't look like adam
[1:41:10] he looked like his daddy that god had
[1:41:11] destroyed before he was even born
[1:41:14] you ever thought about that so he was
[1:41:17] born a bigger guy a hairy guy or maybe
[1:41:19] something like that
[1:41:21] now what happened the polluted seed of
[1:41:22] adam has polluted and absolutely
[1:41:23] destroyed the land so see there's
[1:41:25] nothing righteous in that adam
[1:41:28] except what he did to top christ by
[1:41:30] taking the bride and saying god
[1:41:33] what did what did brother ryan say adam
[1:41:35] did i mean abraham did
[1:41:37] god couldn't kill abraham i couldn't
[1:41:39] kill sarah when sarah laughed at god and
[1:41:42] lied to god
[1:41:44] what did brother brown say he said god
[1:41:46] would have destroyed sarah if it hadn't
[1:41:49] been for abraham
[1:41:51] why because she was a part of him and
[1:41:53] god honored that well guess what same
[1:41:55] thing eve was a part of adam and god
[1:41:57] honored that
[1:42:02] and because that he has did this
[1:42:07] the polluted seed of adam god will
[1:42:09] destroy them what the natural
[1:42:11] polluted seed of adam god's going to
[1:42:14] destroy
[1:42:16] you want to read this let's see i got it
[1:42:18] wrote down here turn to revelations 11
[1:42:19] and we'll find out get over in
[1:42:21] revelation 11th chapter we'll see that
[1:42:22] god said about them
[1:42:24] who's destroying the earth which is
[1:42:26] there in revelation 11.
[1:42:28] but we put a lot on
[1:42:32] on eve and but you know if you're if
[1:42:35] you're standing
[1:42:36] in the garden of eden and
[1:42:39] especially with moses watching what's
[1:42:41] going on
[1:42:43] then you got a prophet in the end time
[1:42:44] the prophet in the end time tells us
[1:42:46] says
[1:42:47] eve was deceived the bible says evil is
[1:42:49] the see and deception i told you i read
[1:42:50] you the
[1:42:51] i read you the definition of deception
[1:42:54] or deceived
[1:42:55] it's doing something thinking you're
[1:42:56] right so she did that
[1:42:59] she never in any part of that what she
[1:43:02] did
[1:43:03] satan so deceived her she walked right
[1:43:05] into it walked right
[1:43:07] to it through it and to adam before i
[1:43:11] believe
[1:43:11] her eyes were opened when adam said what
[1:43:13] have you done and she explained it and
[1:43:15] he's like
[1:43:16] oh
[1:43:20] because what did he do he had questioned
[1:43:22] her but what did god do when god came
[1:43:23] down in the garden of eden he walks to
[1:43:25] the garden of eden
[1:43:26] he said adam who art adam said i was
[1:43:28] afraid
[1:43:29] god said what have you done remember the
[1:43:32] bible says what have you done
[1:43:35] there's something there's something
[1:43:36] going on here you me and you used to be
[1:43:38] able to talk while you back in there in
[1:43:40] the bushes with them fig leaves over
[1:43:41] your
[1:43:42] over who told you you were naked what
[1:43:44] the bible said who told you you were
[1:43:46] naked we'll read that next week
[1:43:48] who told you you were naked he said the
[1:43:49] woman you gave me that revelation
[1:43:52] that she brought to adam
[1:43:57] god said what have you done
[1:44:01] right she said the serpent
[1:44:05] beguiled me and i did eat and partake
[1:44:09] so what did god do he didn't destroy his
[1:44:12] look how awful that was
[1:44:14] think about it folks me and you all the
[1:44:16] awful stupid stuff we do
[1:44:19] there's adam and eve standing there and
[1:44:21] god knows there's going to be a fall
[1:44:22] afterwards
[1:44:23] he knows well he knew what was going to
[1:44:25] happen but what did he do never cursed
[1:44:27] them
[1:44:28] sure he cursed eve's womb we know about
[1:44:31] that
[1:44:32] but he never cursed at him he what he
[1:44:34] cursed uh he cursed the beast first
[1:44:38] then he cursed eve's womb then he cursed
[1:44:41] the ground he come right up the way it
[1:44:42] went down he came right up
[1:44:45] because the beast started it with eve
[1:44:47] eve took it to adam
[1:44:49] then he said all right wait a minute i
[1:44:50] got to destroy this god said
[1:44:53] off goes your feet on your belly you'll
[1:44:55] go dust you'll eat for the rest of your
[1:44:57] life
[1:44:57] and in other words kind of funny
[1:45:00] yesterday
[1:45:01] i've been thinking about all this and
[1:45:02] yesterday my daughter hannah come let's
[1:45:05] stand
[1:45:05] the musicians come we were i was inside
[1:45:09] the house and
[1:45:10] i just got off from work and i come in
[1:45:12] and
[1:45:13] hannah was walking her dog she come in
[1:45:15] screaming like a child
[1:45:17] and i thought that the dog maybe got run
[1:45:19] over but we've got a little friend that
[1:45:21] hangs around with us he's about
[1:45:22] almost six feet long
[1:45:25] he's as long as i am at least and he's
[1:45:27] about that big around
[1:45:29] and it's a black snake and richard's
[1:45:32] seen one down at the
[1:45:33] this is not the one that stays down at
[1:45:35] the at the barn
[1:45:37] but we keep them around because they eat
[1:45:40] um poisonous snakes and keeps poisoning
[1:45:42] the snakes out of the way
[1:45:44] but it was just the fear that was
[1:45:45] instilled in my daughter to see the fear
[1:45:48] in her eyes when she walked outside to
[1:45:49] take the dog out
[1:45:50] and there laid stretched out underneath
[1:45:53] my plum tree was that snake
[1:45:55] well see that's a fear now that snake's
[1:45:57] not going to bother you
[1:46:00] but it's just the fear that's instilled
[1:46:01] how many times have you walked up on a
[1:46:03] snake
[1:46:04] now you walk up on a little a little
[1:46:06] bunny rabbit or you walk up on a little
[1:46:08] maybe a little squirrel or something
[1:46:10] that don't scare you but you walk up on
[1:46:12] a snake
[1:46:13] i don't care folks i've seen a man melt
[1:46:16] at a little green snake about that long
[1:46:19] why it's what happened
[1:46:22] in the garden and god said i'm going to
[1:46:25] throw it every bit in that right there
[1:46:27] i'm going to throw it in that snake and
[1:46:30] there's going to be fear
[1:46:32] and there's going to be nothing pleasant
[1:46:36] about that thing right there these
[1:46:38] people handle these snakes
[1:46:45] but remember my whole point today
[1:46:48] we are all in some sort of deception
[1:46:52] until god takes us out of it
[1:46:55] until our second adam comes to us
[1:46:58] and says darling look what you're about
[1:47:01] to do how many times have god done that
[1:47:03] to us
[1:47:04] but how many times have we went ahead
[1:47:05] and done it
[1:47:08] and how much trouble have we been in
[1:47:10] right but if we'll listen to our husband
[1:47:12] that's why that they had to be set up
[1:47:14] headship between
[1:47:15] christ and the bride adam and eve christ
[1:47:18] in the bride when she got out from under
[1:47:20] her headship she thought she was doing
[1:47:22] what
[1:47:22] brother brown said look what i got this
[1:47:24] new revelation that i've got
[1:47:28] if we get revelation from the bible
[1:47:32] connected it to our spirit man that was
[1:47:35] not born of man or woman
[1:47:37] that's what makes it perfect all right
[1:47:41] but our problem is is we look at eye
[1:47:44] with eyes
[1:47:46] denominational eyes trinitarian eyes
[1:47:49] whatever eyes you don't need to go to
[1:47:51] church just listen to tape eyes that's
[1:47:53] just as bad
[1:47:54] because you can't deny the bible folks
[1:47:57] i'm saying it i i don't care who hears
[1:47:59] it
[1:48:00] the bible can't be changed brother brown
[1:48:03] did not come to change his bible
[1:48:06] he came to make us look into it more
[1:48:09] than we ever have before
[1:48:11] and we being the second eve he said she
[1:48:14] won't be deceived like the first one
[1:48:16] why because we've got the second adam
[1:48:18] not somewhere in the garden
[1:48:22] we got the second adam right here
[1:48:25] in the midst of me and you
[1:48:29] he's not just around us he's in us folks
[1:48:33] and being in us he's going to cause us
[1:48:36] if we'll yield to him the second eve is
[1:48:39] going to cause us
[1:48:40] to be the spoken word children of god
[1:48:43] just like had there not been a fall
[1:48:46] so we brother louise we're this is
[1:48:49] our mandate to destroy the effects
[1:48:53] of that fall right here
[1:48:58] we're going to a second eden no doubt
[1:49:00] we're actually going to go to a
[1:49:02] millennium that's not even ours it's
[1:49:03] just going to prove that the
[1:49:04] sin curse has been lifted because a man
[1:49:06] lives a thousand years over a thousand
[1:49:08] years
[1:49:09] but that's not ours either we're going
[1:49:12] to go walk
[1:49:13] walk out into the out in the realms of
[1:49:15] the of wherever you want to stay you say
[1:49:17] well how can you do that in a glorified
[1:49:18] body you can do whatever you want
[1:49:22] we're going to go out upon the breath of
[1:49:23] the earth and god's just going to take
[1:49:24] his hand and he's just going to
[1:49:27] wipe every bit of this off with a holy
[1:49:30] fire
[1:49:31] and you know what's gonna happen let
[1:49:33] there be light
[1:49:35] let there be trees let there be animals
[1:49:39] let there be a city and you and i
[1:49:43] are going to live in that city we're
[1:49:45] going back
[1:49:47] to where it all started amen
[1:49:50] do you believe that yes but there's
[1:49:53] bumps in the way there's bruises in the
[1:49:55] way there's
[1:49:56] toils and trials and tribulations in the
[1:49:58] way but you know what
[1:50:02] that didn't bother abraham abram got
[1:50:06] changed to abraham and he just kept
[1:50:07] getting older
[1:50:08] and older and older and older but he
[1:50:12] said god you promised it
[1:50:15] god does not mind folks if you get up or
[1:50:17] if you're having trouble you get up in
[1:50:18] the morning all the things you say god
[1:50:21] you promised you promised that we could
[1:50:25] go
[1:50:25] boldly before the throne of grace and
[1:50:27] whatever we ask for
[1:50:30] you give it to us if we ask the right
[1:50:32] way
[1:50:33] brother brown said we've got to ask the
[1:50:34] right way
[1:50:37] are we doing that like i said before we
[1:50:39] got the slate clean
[1:50:41] have we got the road clean in our life
[1:50:44] everything out of there and let god move
[1:50:48] in
[1:50:49] because you know what he wants to he's
[1:50:51] standing there at the door
[1:50:55] he said brother i'm already born again
[1:50:57] i've been born again 30 years he's still
[1:50:58] standing at some door
[1:51:02] because there's doors indoors he's
[1:51:04] knocking at a door saying can i get in
[1:51:06] there please
[1:51:06] i'll help you if you'll let me in all
[1:51:08] you gotta do is open the door
[1:51:10] you don't have to tear it down you don't
[1:51:11] have to rebuild another one just open it
[1:51:14] and let god in let's sing a song god
[1:51:16] bless you but deception remember we're
[1:51:19] all in deception until our eyes are open

[1:52:55] you say i'm not deceived
[1:52:59] you're deceived there's
[1:53:02] honey in the rock for you
[1:53:06] because that's what you got to do you
[1:53:07] just say god i'm deceived
[1:53:12] when you get in some kind of trouble you
[1:53:13] are deceived you you've walked into a
[1:53:16] deception
[1:53:18] and there's only one deceiver god will
[1:53:20] never deceive you
[1:53:22] god is a receiver not a deceiver
[1:53:26] satan just wants you to be as messed up
[1:53:30] as eve was in the garden because that
[1:53:32] same devil that was doing that is right
[1:53:35] here today
[1:53:37] he said well it worked one time it's
[1:53:40] actually worked in jehovah's bride i got
[1:53:42] into israel and made them do what they
[1:53:44] did
[1:53:45] i got into the real bride and i see and
[1:53:47] i changed their whole attitude
[1:53:50] i made them i made them baptized in
[1:53:52] something that ain't him in the bible
[1:53:55] i mean i made them believe in a
[1:53:57] trinitarian doctrine
[1:53:58] that has no truth at all
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:03] and he said i can do it again but no
[1:54:06] god sent us a prophet to say now
[1:54:11] the son of man's here just like he was 2
[1:54:14] 000 years ago
[1:54:15] he's god in human flesh and me and you
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] if you have a problem just go to your
[1:54:23] husband
[1:54:25] that one just go to your husband
[1:54:29] say god i don't want to be in deception
[1:54:34] i want to be right and if you're sincere
[1:54:38] god will give you
[1:54:39] what is right whether it be your healing
[1:54:42] whether it be
[1:54:43] anything in the scripture whether it be
[1:54:45] a question in your mind
[1:54:46] whether it even be how to how to
[1:54:50] you know take your kids and and make
[1:54:52] them you know not make them but teach
[1:54:54] them to do things
[1:54:56] all that god's in all that folks listen
[1:54:58] god is in his children
[1:55:02] he's in all of us just as he was in
[1:55:07] jesus christ he's in us
[1:55:10] he was jesus christ and there's not a
[1:55:13] separate spirit in us
[1:55:14] [Music]
[1:55:16] but see has satan said no you're kind of
[1:55:19] like god
[1:55:22] see that's what he wants you to believe
[1:55:24] that's what he got eve to believe oh
[1:55:26] you'll be
[1:55:26] you'll be a god she should have told him
[1:55:28] and said look
[1:55:29] if you were back there in genesis 1 when
[1:55:31] i was i think god called me a god
[1:55:35] because i'm part of god amen
[1:55:39] is that too strong no we got to realize
[1:55:43] that what god put us on this earth for
[1:55:47] if the second adam was put here to bring
[1:55:49] us back where is that second adam
[1:55:52] he's right here he's right there
[1:55:55] he's inside of you it's the problem is
[1:55:58] is satan is deceiving us in our memory
[1:56:01] reason conscious affection and
[1:56:02] imagination
[1:56:04] look at that all those five words satan
[1:56:07] can play with
[1:56:08] as many times as you let him play
[1:56:12] so get out of that there's no reasoning
[1:56:15] in that middle man
[1:56:17] you're either faith or doubt right there
[1:56:21] so go to god pray for your pastor
[1:56:25] pray for everybody and around the
[1:56:27] country
[1:56:28] pray for your president that's okay
[1:56:31] brother brown did
[1:56:32] i don't care how bad you hate him or
[1:56:34] some of you but
[1:56:35] he's a human being that's got a job to
[1:56:38] do and guess what
[1:56:39] you need to pray for him you need to
[1:56:41] pray for each other though
[1:56:43] that god will deliver every one of us
[1:56:45] from this and we'll get it out of here
[1:56:47] and we can come back it's good to see
[1:56:49] every most of you back
[1:56:50] downstairs is pretty much full so god
[1:56:53] bless you thank you for everything with
[1:56:55] no second service
[1:56:56] so god go with you we'll be here
[1:56:59] wednesday night brother louise will be
[1:57:01] preaching
[1:57:02] we'll keep you updated about brother
[1:57:03] dale um
[1:57:06] we were talking to me and brother bob or
[1:57:08] somebody was talking about that
[1:57:09] or brother joe that seventh or eighth
[1:57:11] day is going to be rough and this is his
[1:57:13] seventh
[1:57:13] or eighth day so
[1:57:16] listen it's his body
[1:57:21] realize this your body can only get rid
[1:57:24] of something now god can take it away
[1:57:25] but your body naturally gets rid of it
[1:57:27] by fever
[1:57:29] and it either has to come out here or
[1:57:32] you understand
[1:57:34] so it's got to get out if it got in it's
[1:57:36] got to get out
[1:57:37] so we're going to pray that that thing
[1:57:39] gets out
[1:57:40] same way all of you yeah we all got
[1:57:42] health issues that we're looking at
[1:57:45] but it's the same god he don't have a
[1:57:48] a list up here that that's tough for god
[1:57:52] and a list that's not so tough no no
[1:57:54] it's not tough at all
[1:57:57] because god is the healer
[1:58:00] and we have not come this far in this
[1:58:03] journey for god to walk away from us and
[1:58:04] leave us alone
[1:58:07] he'll stay he's closer now than he was
[1:58:10] back then
[1:58:11] because he knows the devil's closer
[1:58:16] believe folks believe hebrews 11 go back
[1:58:21] and read hebrews 11.
[1:58:22] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:58:24] for the evidence of things not seen
[1:58:27] oh i don't see it
[1:58:31] maybe your eyes are blinded like these
[1:58:35] have god pull them scales off of your
[1:58:36] eyes and just look down at the word of
[1:58:38] god and say god you said it
[1:58:40] i believe it and that's it
[1:58:43] you love the lord all mine's clear
[1:58:46] pray for brother dale we'll keep you
[1:58:47] updated on him he's fine he'll be okay
[1:58:49] so let's buy our hands

[1:58:52] that you give us thank you

[1:59:12] us the word of god to keep us

[1:59:21] not born of a sexual birth it was not
[1:59:23] born of a carnal mind
[1:59:24] that inside man by the new birth was
[1:59:26] born from the breath of god back in
[1:59:28] genesis 1 26 before the foundation of
