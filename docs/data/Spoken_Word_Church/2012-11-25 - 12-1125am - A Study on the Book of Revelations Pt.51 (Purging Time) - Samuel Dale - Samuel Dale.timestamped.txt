[6:11] this morning with everybody being out
[6:14] remember each
[6:16] one W and Junes now W preaching for
[6:19] brother U Jo Hughes this morning so
[6:22] remember that they be traveling back
[6:24] late this afternoon let's just read our
[6:26] scripture that we've always we've read
[6:29] each one
[6:31] says verse one says the revelation of
[6:33] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[6:35] show unto his servants things which must
[6:37] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[6:40] signified it by his Angel unto his
[6:42] servant John who by record of the word
[6:45] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[6:47] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[6:50] he that readeth and they that hear the
[6:52] words of this prophecy and keep those
[6:54] things which are written therein for the
[6:57] time is at hand what the time to
[7:01] understand all right chap
[7:04] 6:12 and when he had opened the six seal
[7:07] and lo there was a great earthquake and
[7:08] the sun became black as sackcloth of ha
[7:11] and the moon became as blood and the
[7:14] stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even
[7:16] as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs
[7:19] when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and
[7:22] the heaven departed as a scroll and it
[7:24] rolled away and every mountain and
[7:26] Island were moved out of their places
[7:28] and the kingdoms of the this Earth SK
[7:31] excuse me and the kings of this earth
[7:33] and the great men and the rich men and
[7:35] the chief captains and the Mighty Men
[7:37] And every bondman and every
[7:40] Freeman hid themselves in the dens and
[7:42] in the rocks of the mountains and said
[7:44] to the mountains and rocks fall on us
[7:46] and hide us from the face of him that
[7:49] sth on the throne and from the Wrath of
[7:51] the lamb for the great day of his wrath
[7:54] is come and who shall be able to stand
[7:57] you may be seated the Lord at is
[7:59] blessing to the reading of the word now
[8:04] I want to read I didn't give it to them
[8:06] but I want to read
[8:09] Matthew uh
[8:14] 24 and read
[8:17] verse 29 and 30 which is where around
[8:21] said this is where the the seals are
[8:23] that in Matthew 24 said immediately
[8:27] after the tribulation of those days
[8:28] shall the son be darkened and the moon
[8:31] shall not give her light and the Stars
[8:33] shall fall from Heaven and the powers of
[8:36] the heavens shall be
[8:37] shaken and then shall appear the sign of
[8:40] the son of man in heaven and then shall
[8:42] all the tribes of the earth mourn and
[8:44] they shall see the son of man coming in
[8:47] the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[8:50] great Glory all right and we'll try to
[8:53] get to that point after a while if we
[8:57] can but we've been talking about the
[9:00] seals and we want to relate back to make
[9:03] sure that we don't lose our
[9:06] thought because four seals first four
[9:09] seals covers the Earthly journey of
[9:12] mankind all right the four seal winding
[9:15] up being at
[9:18] Armageddon which would be the
[9:20] termination of forces you know coming
[9:23] forth there in
[9:24] Armageddon and then in doing that then
[9:28] we see that this six seal that we've
[9:31] been talking about that that six seal
[9:34] will take place during that time of the
[9:39] purging of Israel the setting aside and
[9:41] getting ready and we'll be at the uh
[9:46] Armageddon because that will be the see
[9:49] you you just lay that seal right back
[9:51] there just like you take the fifth seal
[9:54] and you go through the Earthly journey
[9:57] and you see that it winds up at
[9:59] Armageddon as we said but the fifth seal
[10:02] goes back and shows you the Jews from
[10:05] Calvary up until the Rapture of the
[10:08] church all right then that way you can
[10:11] follow it through the word so then the
[10:13] six
[10:15] seal takes place TimeWise upon the Earth
[10:19] during the time of what we would call
[10:22] the fourth seal dealing with
[10:26] Armageddon because that will be you know
[10:28] Armageddon Edon will be at the end of
[10:31] the 3 and 1/2 years of the ministry of
[10:35] the two witnesses to Israel and they
[10:38] will be at that time in what we've been
[10:41] talking about calling it the uh Jacob's
[10:45] trouble or the time of understanding of
[10:48] the purging of Israel to uh see where
[10:52] we're at all right and it's during that
[10:55] time as we've tried to cover that uh
[10:59] those two prophets wrestle with God
[11:02] until they pull out 144,000 we read that
[11:06] from the from the six seal of paragraph
[11:09] 264 we're going to jump down a couple
[11:11] and just quote them but this is time of
[11:15] the tribulation period is known as
[11:17] Jacob's trouble because Jacob wrestled
[11:21] with the angel of the Lord you know and
[11:23] was their uh name changed from Jacob to
[11:27] Israel and if you'll get over in the
[11:30] seventh seal and read right before he
[11:34] starts into the seventh seal he says
[11:39] that this you know this is the purging
[11:43] time or the setting aside of Israel and
[11:46] he says now we'll go into the seventh
[11:49] seal so he uses that and then we'll drop
[11:52] back and maybe this afternoon pick up
[11:55] why he's speaking those things but you
[11:58] understand what I'm trying to say
[12:00] say this six seal is the Tribulation
[12:04] period all right we covered this past
[12:06] Wednesday and I hope everybody will
[12:08] listen to the tape of what we tried to
[12:11] preach on this past Wednesday of the six
[12:14] seal being the Judgment seal of the word
[12:18] all right that would be found in
[12:20] paragraph 144 through 146 of the six
[12:24] seal it has nothing to do with the bride
[12:27] he says because she's already gone but
[12:30] this is the Judgment seal of the word
[12:33] it's the Judgment upon the
[12:36] church you know the foolish virgin form
[12:39] Church further rejecting or you know not
[12:43] accepting or maybe not hearing uh the
[12:46] message or maybe been blinded by false
[12:50] Shepherds and those are quotes from the
[12:52] prophet of what that would deal with but
[12:56] it's after the Rapture of the bride and
[12:58] this is the the time of the Jews that
[13:02] will there will be 144,000 called
[13:06] out and as they're called out then there
[13:10] has to be as what we want to take up in
[13:12] a minute and just go on through because
[13:15] Wednesday night I just took a little
[13:16] part of what I want you to see and
[13:19] talking about the Judgment seal of the
[13:22] word how that you and
[13:25] I we must judge ourselves right
[13:31] the Bible says examine yourself to see
[13:34] whether you're in the faith or
[13:36] not right see then we're being judged by
[13:39] the word that we hear
[13:42] amen you say but but brother Dale I
[13:44] believe the word that's all
[13:46] right but the word that we hear is
[13:49] judging us and that's the only way we
[13:52] can come up the stature of a perfect man
[13:54] amen right that was what I was trying to
[13:57] get across Wednesday night was that it's
[14:00] a judgment
[14:03] seal and in the communion there you know
[14:06] it says we judge
[14:07] ourselves then we won't be judged right
[14:11] see then we better get down serious
[14:14] because it's a late
[14:17] hour we talk about the End of Time the
[14:19] end of this or that or the other
[14:21] everything looking bad
[14:24] yeah so we better judge ourselves to see
[14:27] whether we're in the word or not
[14:30] right that's what the sick seal has to
[14:33] do with you and
[14:34] I because it's a purging time we covered
[14:38] then that
[14:39] sanctification is a purging of the
[14:42] individual amen you know to bring us to
[14:45] a place all right then watch that now as
[14:49] we read about
[14:51] Israel the world and the things but
[14:54] watch it
[14:56] as you know us
[15:00] now remember that's what I've been
[15:01] asking you to do is read the seal book
[15:04] to find
[15:06] yourself in each seal even though we're
[15:10] not over there where the sick seal takes
[15:12] place we know that but we're not over
[15:15] there where the first seal takes place
[15:18] when a man of sin sits in the temple of
[15:19] God showing himself to be as God we're
[15:23] in the part that's leading up to
[15:27] that because all of these seals is after
[15:30] the Rapture going to
[15:32] Israel but see we can see ourselves then
[15:35] see their Plan of Redemption see our
[15:38] Plan of
[15:41] Redemption we see they are going to be
[15:44] the 144,000 going to be in the
[15:47] Millennium well how did they get
[15:50] there that's the plan of redemption
[15:53] right all right now the Lord willing
[15:56] next Sunday I want to if I can now I
[16:01] want to preach just a
[16:04] message may quote a lot but not giving
[16:07] notes and things but just preach on the
[16:12] Plan of
[16:14] Redemption I've been aiming to do that
[16:16] since we started on this but I I I
[16:19] believe it'll be time to the Lord
[16:21] willing next Sunday so you know make
[16:24] sure you at least hear the message
[16:26] you're not going to be present then try
[16:28] try to hear the message cuz I want to
[16:30] put into one message what I believe
[16:34] about Redemption all right and for all
[16:37] peoples and all like that all right now
[16:41] then we we got up to the point talking
[16:43] about
[16:46] the
[16:48] Judgment seal of the
[16:52] word Jesus Christ was
[16:55] judged right for you and I amen
[16:59] M hanging on Calvary M all
[17:04] right he took our
[17:08] place he was purged more than anybody
[17:11] ever had been purged if you want to talk
[17:14] about a beating uh uh things happening
[17:18] in his
[17:19] life for you and
[17:22] I all right well then all we got to do
[17:25] is accept what he says yes Lord and
[17:29] believe it yes Lord you see Israel will
[17:33] have to go through the
[17:34] tribulation
[17:37] 144,000 for their purging the foolish
[17:41] virgins must be placed there for their
[17:44] purging all right right their
[17:49] judgment we see you and I have got to be
[17:52] purged by the word amen
[17:55] Washed by the Water of the word right
[18:00] then if we purge ourselves we won't have
[18:02] to be purged you get it if we judge
[18:06] ourselves and find ourselves
[18:08] guilty and cry out to God he can cleanse
[18:13] us and do as we talked about on
[18:16] sanctification because that means to be
[18:20] cleansed and set aside for service amen
[18:24] twofold part of that doing see purging
[18:27] us and set
[18:29] soci all right now you find a lot that
[18:33] the prophet would say about purging how
[18:36] that Jesus Christ was so purged so
[18:42] judged until he
[18:45] died that you and I don't have to
[18:49] be see this six seal shows the
[18:54] purging it'll show the purging of the
[18:57] foolish virgins the purging of
[19:02] the fifth seal Jew goes in parts of it
[19:05] because they're
[19:07] represented cuz they've gone through
[19:09] theirs down through time of being
[19:12] killed now I use the word the way I
[19:15] wanted it
[19:17] represented you see later why I'm using
[19:20] that because you you got your
[19:24] 144,000 to be purged in the tribulation
[19:29] with Dan and
[19:31] Ephraim
[19:33] missing
[19:35] right but in the Millennium Dan and
[19:37] Ephraim will be
[19:40] present so what about your other
[19:47] 24,000 it'll have to be done by
[19:52] representation right John went up in
[19:55] Revelation
[19:57] 41 right as
[19:59] what a
[20:01] representation or type
[20:05] example of the bride of
[20:07] Christ right see then Jesus Christ was
[20:13] purged for you and
[20:17] I all those horrible things we think
[20:19] about happening to him was because of
[20:23] you and
[20:25] me so then our representation
[20:34] we must believe it that's
[20:38] right not well brother Dale maybe he was
[20:42] just purged a little bit for me then
[20:44] you're the one that needed the purging
[20:47] right okay you get those goody goody
[20:50] ideas that you didn't need
[20:52] purging you got a
[20:55] problem with the word of God and the
[20:59] Judgment seal of the word will strike
[21:00] you that's what I'm hoping will happen
[21:03] to all of us that we'll see these things
[21:05] and recognize
[21:08] ourselves and see what's going on in our
[21:10] own lives right instead of just looking
[21:13] at what's happening to
[21:15] Israel to see them over there and see
[21:17] what takes
[21:18] place but see a purging this is a
[21:21] purging
[21:24] time see something has to happen for you
[21:27] and I to be able to go up through the
[21:28] statue of a perfect man that's
[21:32] right and I preached to you for many
[21:34] years what that is it's the revealing of
[21:38] God's
[21:39] word all right that's the only way I
[21:43] know those virtues can come they're not
[21:45] an automatic process that we just lay
[21:47] back and take it easy and everything
[21:49] come forth amen right so then in that we
[21:53] must as the word is being revealed
[21:59] every time God reveals something to me
[22:01] it don't make my head big you better
[22:04] believe it makes me smaller than ever
[22:08] before to think that he would reveal to
[22:13] me his word yes see then that's a
[22:18] purging if you don't get nothing out of
[22:20] the message today get that part
[22:22] now if we talk about them being purged
[22:26] remember
[22:29] the opening of the word is doing the
[22:30] same to you and
[22:32] I it's purging us I said the opening of
[22:35] the word not because we have it in our
[22:38] possession not because we believe the
[22:40] message but when the message is
[22:44] revealed that's why it's the Judgment
[22:46] seal of the
[22:50] word so it's shown all the way through
[22:52] the
[22:53] word how that things are made correct
[22:57] remember the judgment comes because
[22:59] something went wrong right right every
[23:03] time the children of Israel would turn
[23:05] away from
[23:07] God he put them into captivity right yes
[23:12] sir things would happen what to purge
[23:17] him that's right because they had went
[23:20] into
[23:23] sin till then every time that we turn
[23:26] around the word is facing us
[23:30] to cleanse us right Purge
[23:34] us to set us
[23:39] free and if we don't repent we W have to
[23:42] answer for it that's
[23:44] right you say what's born again
[23:47] Christian yeah because there is a
[23:49] judgment of the Deeds Done in the body
[23:51] whether good or
[23:53] bad if we don't get rid of it here by
[23:56] cleansing
[23:58] it's going to be purged somewhere that's
[24:02] right you know what that purging going
[24:04] to
[24:06] be you think you get by with it
[24:09] here well I don't want to stand up and
[24:11] tell the church I've done this or that
[24:13] or the
[24:16] other one day you're going to stand
[24:18] before the entire body of Jesus
[24:23] Christ right that's right not a judgment
[24:27] of whether or not you receive eternal
[24:28] life
[24:32] no so the six
[24:34] seal goes on down through
[24:39] time you're going to have to answer for
[24:42] the Deeds Done in the body whether good
[24:43] or bad and we're going to have to do
[24:45] that before all of our brothers and
[24:47] sisters that's
[24:49] right so how much should we want to get
[24:51] rid of these
[24:53] things instead of just allowing them to
[24:56] go on and think we got f with it
[25:00] we're get to Dan and Ephraim in this
[25:02] afternoon the Lord with
[25:04] him you know they thought they got by
[25:07] with
[25:15] it when Dan and Ephraim was taken out
[25:18] did they think they
[25:21] had been taking out
[25:30] don't you think about
[25:32] that did they even consider they had
[25:34] been taken
[25:38] out don't they right on being Dan and
[25:42] ephra
[25:44] right thinking it was
[25:48] right all right then a
[25:53] purging a setting aside getting us ready
[25:58] and the studying of the seal to see
[26:02] ourselves all right let's start off on
[26:04] what we got on the notes then let's go
[26:06] to the number three
[26:09] brother I told him I just quote the
[26:11] first two look what he
[26:15] says 6 Co par paragraph
[26:18] 3:21 in Israel let's take this I mean
[26:21] excuse me Isaiah let's take this Isaiah
[26:24] the prophet seen this sick seal open and
[26:26] spoke of it
[26:32] no he said well how did he see this sick
[26:35] seal
[26:42] open cuz he was a
[26:47] prophet the Bible says that the things
[26:50] that were done unto
[26:51] them were not for
[26:54] them but for us that's right is that
[26:58] Bible right yes all right now so Isaiah
[27:03] the prophet seen it open just like
[27:05] Daniel heard the
[27:16] Thunders see Daniel saw the whole
[27:21] thing see Isaiah was looking forward to
[27:24] seeing it but seeing what was taking
[27:27] place in his life then or the day they
[27:29] were
[27:31] in as I said a minute ago then he could
[27:34] see that when they would do wrong they
[27:36] would go into
[27:39] judgment and he would see it and Isaiah
[27:43] would see as we'll get to it later
[27:45] Isaiah would see all the way over to the
[27:46] cleansing of the
[27:49] world right that's
[27:52] right so then when the prophet would say
[27:54] he seen it in his time or you know
[27:58] that seal was all the way back
[28:01] there
[28:03] right one seal out the Bible get it
[28:06] right entire
[28:08] Bible so they don't get into confusion
[28:11] well how in the world Isaiah see the six
[28:16] seal he wrote about
[28:20] it we must have seen
[28:25] it Isaiah 65 that's
[28:32] right
[28:34] right look at down a minute to that and
[28:37] you'll see but don't just get hung up on
[28:39] something how did Isaiah see
[28:43] that that six seal was the way down here
[28:46] it was spoke of all the way through the
[28:49] word first seal was spoke of all the way
[28:52] through the word second third fourth
[28:54] fifth that's what I've been trying to
[28:55] get you to
[28:57] see it was spoke of throughout the
[29:01] word and now remember we seen Jesus saw
[29:09] it now
[29:13] Isaiah seen it and spoke of
[29:17] it Isaiah 65 we'll get to it in a little
[29:21] while Jesus saw it in Matthew 24
[29:26] right I saw it
[29:34] and then we find others that saw it we
[29:37] find it tyed out in Jacob we find it
[29:38] tyed out in
[29:40] Egypt we see it tyed out at the
[29:44] cross don't get what it's being
[29:47] said Isaiah saw it Jesus saw it and
[29:52] spoke of it all right but Jesus didn't
[29:55] just speak of it
[29:58] he had to partake of it right for you
[30:01] and I not for himself right so now let's
[30:05] let's go on and just read a you go ahead
[30:07] and on
[30:08] for paragraph
[30:11] 327 6 watch this six opening here now
[30:15] Plum back here 730 years before Christ
[30:20] come in Christ
[30:23] come he's
[30:24] been he's been 2,000 years that'd be
[30:28] about about 2700 years ago Isaiah seen
[30:32] this sealed hanging
[30:35] there Isaiah looked and saw
[30:39] it he saw a purging of
[30:45] Israel and come on do do we need to
[30:47] bring this one where brother said that
[30:48] Isaiah wrote a complete
[30:54] book where Isaiah saw the beginning
[30:59] then he saw the coming of John the
[31:00] Baptist and Jesus coming
[31:04] right and see the
[31:07] cross Isaiah
[31:09] 53 Isaiah
[31:13] 65 he covers
[31:19] the created a new Heaven and a new
[31:24] Earth so he saw it
[31:29] mankind down through there has seen
[31:30] these
[31:31] things
[31:36] okay now what about it in the end
[31:42] time go ahead with the next
[31:46] one 3:11 3126
[31:49] heal and we he was about to deliver his
[31:52] only begotten son which was his only
[31:54] begotten Jacob is his son but this is
[31:56] his only begotten Matthew 27 let's see
[31:59] what he did there Matthew the 27th
[32:02] chapter now remember his son had been
[32:04] beaten he had been troubled and they had
[32:06] made fun of him and he was now hanging
[32:09] on the cross at 3:00 on Good Friday
[32:12] afternoon just about to take place
[32:15] Matthew 27 chapter of Matthew in the
[32:20] 45th verse I believe it is all right and
[32:23] watch what he goes on
[32:24] to he goes straight from the sick now
[32:27] then sixth hour there was Darkness over
[32:30] the land until the night that's in
[32:33] Matthew right now he goes to revelation
[32:36] behold when it opened the sixth Hill
[32:38] there was a great earthquake the sun in
[32:39] the darkness no Blackness see it was
[32:43] spoke of all the way through the word
[32:45] and you come down to Moses in
[32:50] Egypt T out at the cross Moses in Egypt
[32:54] coming out Blackness darkness and things
[32:58] spoke of all the way through the Bible a
[33:02] purging when you see a purging going
[33:06] on you realize that there's something
[33:08] about that
[33:14] seal and they spoke of
[33:17] it Isaiah spoke of it Jesus spoke of it
[33:21] Moses and his doings tyed it out amen
[33:28] that's why you can come over the end
[33:29] time and close the
[33:33] heavens CU it already done it
[33:37] once and what one of the two witnesses
[33:40] will be what in the spirit and the power
[33:42] of Moses to bring down the plagues to
[33:47] purge he knows how to do it cuz he's
[33:49] done it
[33:50] before but Jesus Christ at
[33:54] Calvary didn't just speak of it
[33:59] he partook of it
[34:04] right
[34:06] right the reason he partook of it was
[34:09] because of you and I that's right amen
[34:12] are you following
[34:14] me to speak of it is one thing to write
[34:17] of it is one
[34:19] thing but to live
[34:23] it Jesus didn't just speak of it he did
[34:26] in Matthew 24 sure
[34:29] but then he went forth and made
[34:32] manifest because the Judgment of all
[34:35] things came upon
[34:42] him the Judgment of every sin that has
[34:46] ever been
[34:47] committed or ever will
[34:49] be was placed on
[34:53] him but he took that mainly for you and
[34:56] I
[34:59] come on
[35:01] church because even that some words got
[35:04] to be reckoned with about the things
[35:07] that have
[35:11] happened through
[35:16] then there'll have to be a
[35:20] day that he'll judged the or
[35:24] purged the foolish virgin
[35:28] you purged
[35:32] 144,000 he has to purge
[35:34] Israel
[35:37] right then he has to purge the
[35:41] world right
[35:45] amen that's what Isaiah was speaking
[35:48] of the world has got to be cleansed
[35:51] there can't be a millennial Reign
[35:52] without a
[35:53] purging right so there's you six seal
[35:58] amen the purging of all
[36:13] things trying to cut down on some that
[36:15] where won't be so
[36:17] much going over to number seven which is
[36:20] paragraph 141 of the S
[36:23] seal and we open get to the seal did you
[36:27] know no that we first we start out now
[36:32] Israel then we see the first
[36:36] church not the bride the pur Church by
[36:40] tribulation remember the church goes
[36:42] through the tribulation the bride don't
[36:44] go through the tribulation right all
[36:47] right he sees them coming up where
[36:50] Revelation
[36:52] 7 a great number of real sinere hearts
[36:56] have come up the Great tribul the church
[36:58] and gone the bride Andes the church word
[37:01] Israel to be purged the church is to be
[37:04] purged and you see them in chapter
[37:10] 7 that they're
[37:12] purged but not the
[37:17] bride you understand what I was trying
[37:19] to get to a minute
[37:21] ago Jesus just didn't speak of
[37:25] it that was great mhm
[37:29] Isaiah he spoke of it right but he never
[37:33] what would be the word or he never
[37:36] experienced it or participated in
[37:42] it sure in his day he lived and was
[37:45] hunted I mean was persecuted and
[37:46] everything for what he
[37:49] said but not what he saw under that six
[37:53] seal purging
[37:58] he saw they' have to be a new Heaven and
[38:02] a new
[38:04] Earth right Jesus spoke of it in Matthew
[38:09] 24 but then he went on to experience
[38:13] it
[38:15] right a
[38:18] purging the
[38:22] calvary but if he hadn't done that you
[38:24] and I wouldn't be
[38:26] here I hope you're following me I keep
[38:29] repeating myself because I find out a
[38:31] lot of times if I don't repeat myself
[38:34] people will say you said so and so but
[38:37] if I repeat it two or three times I've
[38:40] got very few people to come and say you
[38:42] said so and
[38:44] so all right Jesus actually had to
[38:49] experience
[38:50] it he had to live through it
[38:57] for you and me amen
[39:00] right but see then we can't be just left
[39:02] out of it that's
[39:04] why you must be
[39:07] justified yes sir and
[39:11] Sanctified cleansed and set aside
[39:16] purged judge yourself
[39:22] unworthy and die to yourself that's
[39:25] right right we've got to experience it
[39:29] not the six seal Judgment of the
[39:31] tribulation of the wrath of God poured
[39:33] out
[39:35] no we don't go there the reason we don't
[39:38] go there is because we judge ourselves
[39:41] that's
[39:43] right we pray for
[39:46] forgiveness Amen to purge
[39:48] ourselves
[39:50] right brother R said now here's a quote
[39:54] you need to look up but I'll you find it
[39:56] for you he said I I believe in a
[40:03] Purgatory wait a minute
[40:07] now well he said
[40:09] it he said because our purging is going
[40:13] on now that's
[40:16] right he said that's the kind of
[40:18] purgatory I believe in a purging now M
[40:23] right right a cleansing now amen you
[40:26] realize try to get to it in a minute to
[40:28] where we see that this world has got to
[40:30] be so
[40:34] cleansed until they can't be any
[40:41] sin the
[40:43] world and we know it's not going on over
[40:46] to the Future home because this is only
[40:48] speaking of it that's why we when you
[40:51] get into
[40:52] Isaiah 65 you you find a a little
[40:56] problem
[40:59] it's not a problem to me because I know
[41:01] what he's talking
[41:03] about but all it spoke of in Isaiah
[41:07] 65 is a millennial
[41:13] Reign but the prophet uses it for the
[41:15] future
[41:19] harm there's going to be a drastic
[41:22] purging over there later right that's
[41:25] right right
[41:27] we got to get this thing clean enough
[41:29] for where the Millennium can take place
[41:32] that's right
[41:33] amen and I said that the way I wanted to
[41:36] we got to get this time
[41:40] right the reason Israel is going to be
[41:43] qualified to go into the Millennium the
[41:46] 144,000 is because they're going to be
[41:49] purged
[41:53] right if you and I are not Purge we
[41:56] we're not qualified right
[41:59] right if we're not Sanctified cleanse
[42:02] and set
[42:03] aside then we don't have the new birth
[42:06] that's right
[42:09] amen you can't bypass the the processes
[42:12] and get the new birth then go back and
[42:13] get
[42:15] Sanctified it doesn't work that way
[42:19] now I don't believe when we get to
[42:21] heaven we're going to be good
[42:22] people we're going to be what we are
[42:24] here that's right right
[42:28] it only changes our dwelling
[42:32] place so now Jesus actually had to
[42:35] experience
[42:37] it but it wasn't for
[42:40] himself
[42:43] right he didn't have to be
[42:46] purged
[42:49] amen he's
[42:51] perfect that's
[42:53] right you didn't have to be cleansed
[42:59] but he said I set myself
[43:04] aside he judged himself the fact that he
[43:07] knew he must
[43:12] die take all of that
[43:15] punishment and even go to
[43:18] hell for you and I
[43:24] amen a pury
[43:29] that's why you and I we go through
[43:31] processes
[43:33] here we go through a
[43:39] justification a
[43:42] repentance
[43:45] you then we go through
[43:49] sanctification to be cleansed and set
[43:53] aside but then we have to have the
[43:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:58] or we're not qualified for the
[43:59] Millennium that's
[44:01] right we're not
[44:05] Israel we're not somebody that is given
[44:08] because that he blinded
[44:10] them right we're blind we're lost that's
[44:14] right
[44:16] amen so we better start judging
[44:19] ourselves that's
[44:21] right to find out whether or not we're
[44:23] born
[44:25] again go remember remember he done that
[44:28] for you and I he experienced a a
[44:31] cleansing a
[44:33] purging for you and
[44:35] I not that he needed
[44:39] it but we must have it
[44:43] amen then not only do we have to have
[44:46] the new
[44:50] birth you know the fiery baptism of the
[44:53] Holy Ghost coming in to purge out all
[44:55] things to where he can live in our heart
[44:58] our
[45:00] soul we must have a
[45:03] daily sanctification like Paul said I
[45:05] Die daily
[45:09] amen but then there's got to be somebody
[45:11] in the end time that's going to be so
[45:13] purged by the
[45:15] word yes sir believe that God can come
[45:19] and live in US amen the way he wants to
[45:23] amen
[45:27] so cleansed until there's no
[45:30] sin what do you mean Brother D I got
[45:32] born again I ain't sin since then you
[45:34] are
[45:35] liar and a
[45:37] hypocrite that's good enough you want
[45:40] other word
[45:42] sharper the Bible says we sin the
[45:45] prophet said we sin every day right
[45:47] right right so don't go into the garbage
[45:50] cans with
[45:54] it cuz you'll never get anywhere with
[45:56] cleansing if you don't admit you got
[45:58] something you need to be cleansed from
[46:00] that's right amen
[46:06] amen so Isaiah could speak of
[46:10] it Moses could speak of
[46:13] it the prophets could speak
[46:19] on a purging that would have to come one
[46:22] day
[46:27] we good to it to this afternoon where
[46:29] that Moses and the Dan and Ephraim taken
[46:36] out their names will be put
[46:43] back so they going to have to be
[46:49] purged their names will never was taken
[46:52] off the book of
[46:55] life but you and I our names removed
[46:57] we're
[47:00] lost what about it
[47:02] church we the reason we don't have to go
[47:05] through these
[47:07] things in regardless if that 144,000
[47:11] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:13] white
[47:14] robes the F seal Jew gets white
[47:19] robes the Old Testament Saints will have
[47:21] to get white
[47:24] robes but yet they still never went
[47:26] through the
[47:29] experience that's right while it was
[47:31] alive that's
[47:33] right you said well the the 144,000 do
[47:37] yeah but they doesn't turn down sunship
[47:40] so they can't come
[47:44] in but I want you to think of
[47:49] something that
[47:52] 144,000
[47:55] represents all
[47:59] Israel if not how you going to get them
[48:05] there that's for later it's the
[48:08] statement I'd write that down and think
[48:10] on
[48:12] it you got to have a
[48:23] representation you don't have any
[48:26] statements like we used to
[48:30] think that maybe they' go to the white
[48:32] drone cuz that's what I used to
[48:35] think until I find out they get white
[48:39] robes before the 144,000 are
[48:47] killed you said but now wait just a
[48:50] minute got you trapped just in case
[48:52] somebody wants to figure it out later
[48:54] I'll get back to it I'll just say it you
[48:56] think you got it trapped but you better
[48:58] hold
[48:59] on the prophet explained Revelation
[49:05] 7 it's not all after the opening of the
[49:13] seals it's all in the opening of the
[49:16] SE get back to that look
[49:20] listen go down to number 10 because we
[49:24] talk about the seventh seal being in a
[49:25] three-fold manner
[49:28] sorry about that yes get up H to every
[49:31] time I move so I quit trying to
[49:35] move so look what he
[49:39] says this is on the seventh seal
[49:41] paragraph
[49:42] 386
[49:44] 388 through there and we find out in
[49:48] this that the six seal now being opened
[49:51] it was for a three-fold purpose now here
[49:54] was the purposes the first
[49:57] was that the sleeping
[49:59] virgin had to go through the tribulation
[50:02] period for
[50:06] purification
[50:08] now their purification don't give them
[50:11] eternal
[50:13] life it only makes them
[50:20] qualified thank with me their
[50:23] purification don't give them eternal
[50:25] life they got to go to the white WR to
[50:27] get eternal
[50:29] life
[50:31] right don't tie Israel in there now
[50:34] because we'll get back to
[50:36] that see the first was as sleeping
[50:38] virgin had to go through the tribulation
[50:40] period for purification she had to be
[50:42] purged for sins of unbelief and
[50:45] rejecting the
[50:48] message R said over in the message
[50:51] somewhere that is talking about those
[50:53] who never heard the message or those who
[50:56] are blinded by false
[50:59] Shepherds but by rejecting the message
[51:02] look what you
[51:07] do well I just don't believe in that old
[51:09] stuff y'all talk about and all that hair
[51:11] and dress
[51:13] and well the word says
[51:17] it that's
[51:20] right word
[51:23] says we used to preach that before we
[51:26] heard of a prophet on back about 50
[51:29] years ago or 60 there was a lot of
[51:31] preaching about that and all the
[51:33] denominations used to preach it and you
[51:35] know it cuz you some of you was there
[51:36] and you're old enough to remember it and
[51:39] you remember none of those women would
[51:40] come to church without a hat
[51:44] on my mother-in-law would have never
[51:46] darted into a church without a hat
[51:50] on why they knew they had to have a
[51:54] covering right and somebody told him it
[51:57] was a
[51:59] hat instead of the
[52:03] word right to their hir that they have
[52:07] but watch J be Pur of her sins of
[52:09] unbelief and rejecting the
[52:11] mission this was done in the tribulation
[52:13] period we see they wind up over here in
[52:16] Revelation
[52:17] [Music]
[52:18] 7 between the 6th and the 7th chapter
[52:21] here and she's first and she's been
[52:23] given her robes all right they will get
[52:27] white
[52:28] robes remember where to get it now she's
[52:31] not the bride but it's the church the
[52:33] pure people that that didn't have the
[52:35] opportunity maybe to receive the message
[52:36] or in some way were blinded by the false
[52:38] prophets there heard the rest of the
[52:40] quote they didn't get a chance and they
[52:43] yet they're really sincere people and
[52:44] God knows their heart in near their
[52:46] Purge during this
[52:49] time
[52:53] now I want to preach on that
[52:55] representation but I'm trying to keep
[52:57] from
[52:58] it
[53:00] because is it only the end time that has
[53:03] foolish
[53:06] virgins and brother R said this virgin
[53:08] foolish virgins never ate I can show you
[53:11] a quote where he said it would pointed
[53:12] down to the end time yeah but he said
[53:16] there foolish virgins in never age when
[53:20] another foolish virgins in time passed
[53:29] where's their

[56:19] seal
[56:21] now everything
[56:27] there got any sin to it going to be
[56:30] purged during the sick
[56:37] seal remember one
[56:39] thing this evening's
[56:42] message there's only six
[56:44] seals written in the word of God you
[56:48] said well wait a minute there's seven no
[56:50] it says silence in
[56:51] [Music]
[56:54] heaven Jesus never spoke of it in

[57:02] don't go off and run me in the wrong
[57:04] way what will be that seventh
[57:06] [Music]
[57:08] seal if there's only six seals so in the
[57:12] Plan of
[57:14] Redemption
[57:16] okay so the whole earth is to be
[57:20] purged everything is to get ready
[57:25] why number
[57:27] 11 as you call
[57:30] look paragraph 32 63 423
[57:35] 428 I just finished a series of services
[57:38] on the last seven seal and finding in
[57:41] this Sixth Seal that there was a great
[57:43] interruption in in nature the moon the
[57:46] stars the Earth belts the church is
[57:47] purged Israel is church purged and
[57:50] everything is purged under that seventh
[57:52] seal it's the seventh seal yeah CU it's
[57:55] the end of all things
[57:58] good it ends a purging okay we got any
[58:02] problem why is it have to be purged so
[58:05] that the Millennium can start
[58:10] in you can't have a millennial Reign
[58:13] without the
[58:14] purging you reading on down that's what
[58:16] the church today listen to you and I and
[58:20] what I want to point to you that we need
[58:22] a cleansing before anything can begin
[58:26] from God we got to have a
[58:29] purging right and when we look and see
[58:33] these things that is now under the
[58:36] present condition ex just in the way
[58:37] they are we can see that we got in got
[58:40] to have something to happen before God
[58:43] can continue his program and a
[58:49] purging continue his
[58:52] program without a purgy that's talking
[58:55] about me and you that's not talking
[58:57] about over there right he's talking
[59:00] about me and
[59:02] you you want a
[59:09] Revival then start
[59:11] repent what it
[59:14] is start praying for a purging no I want
[59:18] to
[59:20] Revival Revival don't come without a
[59:24] purging rapture won't come without a
[59:28] purging M that's why brother Brandon
[59:31] made the
[59:32] statement he said the church does better
[59:35] under
[59:37] persecution
[59:40] right
[59:42] right brother Dale you want persecution
[59:45] I want a Rapture and if that's what it
[59:47] takes to bring it amen yes
[59:52] sir what do you
[59:54] want well I I want ride out of here on
[59:56] fire b
[1:00:00] e
[1:00:02] well hasn't been done before
[1:00:05] right but before the Millennium can
[1:00:08] start there has to be a cleansing
[1:00:11] first and that's what the church
[1:00:14] today and I want to point to you that we
[1:00:17] need a cleans
[1:00:20] him you remember his first wife and
[1:00:23] child was taken from him because of
[1:00:27] Disobedience
[1:00:33] true he was praying one day he said you
[1:00:38] purged me one time
[1:00:41] Lord he's talking about the death of his
[1:00:44] wife and
[1:00:45] daughter and the problems of things he
[1:00:49] said Purge me
[1:00:51] again when I see next in your mind go
[1:00:54] what he wanted his wife to be killed in
[1:00:55] this
[1:00:56] boy I quit being
[1:01:01] stupid that wasn't what he
[1:01:03] wanted right he wanted whatever God
[1:01:11] wanted
[1:01:13] right what was the reason that his wife
[1:01:16] and daughter was
[1:01:18] taken cuz he listened to his wife about
[1:01:22] her mother Y and he would not go to the
[1:01:25] world
[1:01:28] world and be an
[1:01:34] evangelist brother R said we let our
[1:01:38] families we let the preacher we let
[1:01:41] everybody get in the way chur you
[1:01:48] know what about a purge
[1:01:52] you he wanted to be
[1:01:54] so s side for
[1:01:59] God until whatever it cost
[1:02:01] him
[1:02:03] right he goes on in the message looking
[1:02:07] there in the message but it's paragraph
[1:02:11] 256 he's talking about Israel and look
[1:02:13] what he
[1:02:15] says she's got everything she's Israel
[1:02:17] what she's there ready for the
[1:02:22] purging that God will take that 144,000
[1:02:25] from it
[1:02:27] Israel today is dire for a
[1:02:30] purging got to be in the
[1:02:33] Homeland right right you and I got to be
[1:02:36] in the Homeland what is the Homeland for
[1:02:39] you and I the message of the hour that's
[1:02:42] right amen
[1:02:44] amen but how many are reading it our
[1:02:46] love story magazines
[1:02:56] have you ever read a love story
[1:03:00] magazine everything in it is beautiful
[1:03:02] isn't
[1:03:04] it there's not a dab of Truth in it at
[1:03:08] all cuz reality don't live like that
[1:03:14] right you go to work every day and the
[1:03:17] people around you smell so
[1:03:19] good and they're neatly dressed
[1:03:30] right but do you think they live like
[1:03:32] that all the
[1:03:35] time you got a
[1:03:40] problem so you read Love Story magazines
[1:03:43] to try to figure out how to be something
[1:03:45] why not just be a Christian
[1:03:50] amen and then out way we take the ups
[1:03:52] and the Downs don't we right
[1:04:00] okay but see we live in a fantasy
[1:04:08] world
[1:04:10] right but listen church he said Israel
[1:04:14] was ready for a
[1:04:16] purging are you and I ready for
[1:04:19] one that's
[1:04:24] right yeah it could have already be at
[1:04:26] the White House
[1:04:28] outy that you don't get another
[1:04:31] check and you know what in this church
[1:04:35] it would really be a
[1:04:37] whacko cuz there's a lot of us drawing
[1:04:40] from the
[1:04:48] government one stroke of the pen and all
[1:04:51] your money in the bank is no
[1:04:54] good you complain all you want to they
[1:04:58] can't do that to me I'm an American
[1:05:02] citizen about
[1:05:05] that Castro changed the money down in
[1:05:07] Cuba he didn't ask him if they citizens
[1:05:10] that's right he just changed the
[1:05:16] money Brother D you think we're going I
[1:05:19] don't know what we're going
[1:05:21] through go when we get it figured out
[1:05:24] that's what we're going through it ain't
[1:05:25] going to be what we're going going
[1:05:26] through right so quit trying to figure
[1:05:29] it out just live day by day and forget
[1:05:32] it
[1:05:34] right but I would tell you you to put
[1:05:37] your a can of beans up in the closet
[1:05:39] somewhere you may need it one day
[1:05:43] right no Brother D when I need it go to
[1:05:46] be
[1:05:52] there the children of Israel thought
[1:05:54] that about God
[1:05:57] but he sent them through many times of
[1:06:00] purging because of their
[1:06:08] unbelief lot of people don't believe in
[1:06:10] the persecution I don't believe in a
[1:06:11] tribulation for the bride no
[1:06:13] way but they sure a lot of things would
[1:06:16] brother around said you could have been
[1:06:17] physically
[1:06:24] barff right
[1:06:26] well I don't think he'll do that to the
[1:06:30] bride what's he going to do when we need
[1:06:37] persecution come
[1:06:39] on if we won't judge ourselves he's
[1:06:41] going to have to judge us right that's
[1:06:44] right is that true that's right that's
[1:06:48] right okay go ahead and live
[1:06:53] in well I'm going to be there anyway day
[1:06:55] don't matter what it
[1:06:59] do you know where you're headed when
[1:07:01] you're talking like
[1:07:03] that you're headed to the tribulation
[1:07:06] period right without any hopes of being
[1:07:10] a foolish
[1:07:12] virgin because when you're talking like
[1:07:14] that you're admitting you
[1:07:16] believe if you admit you believe you
[1:07:18] can't qualify for a foolish
[1:07:22] virgin you mean brother Dale there's no
[1:07:24] hope for me being a foolish Virg
[1:07:26] I don't believe for myself I just honest
[1:07:28] it's either Rapture or Hell busting wide
[1:07:31] open for
[1:07:34] me cuz you see I judged myself on that
[1:07:36] one time this message is right right I
[1:07:41] don't have no extra money laying over in
[1:07:43] the Swiss bank
[1:07:45] account just in case it don't work
[1:07:57] see a purging for the bride yeah but but
[1:07:59] we're but we're pure and holy
[1:08:05] C we're pure holy and clean if
[1:08:09] we thought it
[1:08:11] correctly we
[1:08:14] repent we don't repent we ain't pure and
[1:08:16] holy
[1:08:18] right come on you give an account of the
[1:08:20] Deeds Done in the body whether good or
[1:08:22] bad you don't believe that right
[1:08:26] that's not a decision of whether or not
[1:08:28] you get eternal
[1:08:32] life you have eternal life we do but
[1:08:35] we'll answer for the Deeds Done in the
[1:08:37] body amen well I know I tell you what I
[1:08:40] can't understand you because you preach
[1:08:41] one time we're pure as a l you preach
[1:08:44] the next time we're Sinners that's
[1:08:46] exactly right both of them is right
[1:08:47] that's right right According to which
[1:08:49] one we qualify for
[1:08:57] but
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:01] listen I got a whole lot of quotes here
[1:09:03] but I don't want to get into it so let
[1:09:05] me preach a little
[1:09:09] bit in Matthew
[1:09:13] 24 there of verse one 2 and
[1:09:20] three Jesus had made a
[1:09:23] statement and he said one of these days
[1:09:25] it won't be one stone left on another
[1:09:27] out
[1:09:30] here so they got together that afternoon
[1:09:33] and sat down with him and they
[1:09:37] said you made a statement about they
[1:09:39] won't be one stone or
[1:09:42] another said when will that
[1:09:46] be and what will be the sign of thy
[1:09:51] coming and of the end of the world
[1:09:56] they asked him three questions brother
[1:09:58] around said he answered three
[1:10:01] questions all
[1:10:04] right question number
[1:10:07] one when will it be that there won't be
[1:10:09] one stone left on another Titus and
[1:10:12] 870 I got the quote Cay here if you want
[1:10:15] it from the
[1:10:17] prophet Titus and
[1:10:21] ad70 but have you really thought about
[1:10:24] what was asked in and what he
[1:10:29] said remember it was in Matthew
[1:10:34] 24 that he answered those three
[1:10:38] questions in Matthew 24 is
[1:10:42] the six
[1:10:47] seals
[1:10:49] right now you're supposed to be reading
[1:10:51] the
[1:10:52] book you know to understand
[1:10:56] Matthew 24 is the six
[1:11:01] seals ver seal
[1:11:04] is verse four and Jesus answered and
[1:11:07] said unto them take heed that no man
[1:11:10] deceive you for many shall come in my
[1:11:13] name saying I am Christ and shall
[1:11:16] deceive many amen for seal right white
[1:11:20] horse
[1:11:23] rider second seal is verse
[1:11:28] 6 you hear wars and rumors of
[1:11:33] wars ends not
[1:11:38] yet third
[1:11:40] seal verse 7 Nations shall rise against
[1:11:44] Nations and Kingdom against Kingdom be
[1:11:46] pestilence earthquakes and dark all
[1:11:48] these things are the beginning of
[1:11:50] Sorrow verse 9 for seal and they shall
[1:11:54] deliver you up and to be afflicted and
[1:11:57] shall kill you and you shall be hated of
[1:11:59] all
[1:12:03] Nations the many false prophets shall
[1:12:06] rise and deceive
[1:12:10] many but now
[1:12:13] listen three
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:17] questions when will it be that there
[1:12:19] won't be one stone left on
[1:12:23] another when will it be
[1:12:25] it or what will be the sign of thy
[1:12:30] coming and the end of the
[1:12:33] world he answered of in six
[1:12:39] seals he answered their questions in six
[1:12:44] seals right the first is Titus
[1:12:49] right 8070 let's see I'll give you that
[1:12:52] where be on
[1:12:59] people might argue about that
[1:13:01] point I'll get to it in a
[1:13:03] second where he says it's Titus yeah all
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:08] uh paragraph 30 of the unfailing words
[1:13:12] of
[1:13:13] promised he talks about
[1:13:16] 8070 and that's when it would be one
[1:13:18] stone left on another
[1:13:20] okay but he answers three questions
[1:13:28] what will be the
[1:13:29] sign of thy
[1:13:36] coming it's the coming of the son of
[1:13:39] man right is that what we've been in in
[1:13:42] the seal or and
[1:13:45] thing what about the end of the world
[1:13:47] blood
[1:13:50] ROM will it be the end of the world
[1:13:55] number
[1:13:59] 13 I jumped up and down so if it takes
[1:14:01] him a little
[1:14:04] time paragraph 425 The Sixth
[1:14:07] Seal he's talking about the seal watch
[1:14:09] the next thing he said now learn a
[1:14:12] parable and learn a parable is not in
[1:14:15] verse one or 2 three or four learn a
[1:14:17] parable is verse 30 or 31 31 somewhere
[1:14:20] in
[1:14:21] there so it's all coming together then
[1:14:25] he starts on
[1:14:27] Parables these things will be he's
[1:14:29] answering them three questions they're
[1:14:32] so particular about busting up this new
[1:14:34] part of the message to change
[1:14:37] paragraphs I I wish I could help them a
[1:14:40] little bit cuz that should
[1:14:42] be made another
[1:14:44] paragraph cuz it changed his
[1:14:48] thought then he starts on
[1:14:51] Parables that's one thought then when
[1:14:55] these things be he said these things
[1:14:56] will he's answering them three questions
[1:15:00] what will be the three sign these signs
[1:15:03] and what will be the sign of your coming
[1:15:05] what will be the sign of the end of the
[1:15:07] world and the six one there was the end
[1:15:10] of the
[1:15:14] world now brother
[1:15:18] brand the sixth
[1:15:20] one he said is the end of the world
[1:15:28] what does your mind think of when you
[1:15:30] think of end of the
[1:15:35] world when there's never a
[1:15:39] time in eternity or
[1:15:43] anywhere that the world has done away

[1:16:06] mean what did Jesus mean when he
[1:16:10] said and they ask him what will be the
[1:16:13] end of the
[1:16:15] world when that sick seal BL forth the
[1:16:19] Armageddon and the cleansing and the

[1:19:15] old I don't understand that I don't
[1:19:18] that's a millennium but to S being 100
[1:19:20] years

[1:19:41] enjoy the work of their hands they shall
[1:19:44] not labor in vain nor bring forth or
[1:19:46] trouble for they are the seed of the
[1:19:48] bless of the Lord and their offspring
[1:19:51] with them they shall come to pass before

[1:20:09] destroy in my Holy Mountain sayth the
[1:20:12] Lord that's a millennium
[1:20:15] right that's a
[1:20:19] millennium but notice what he said go
[1:20:22] back up to verse 177
[1:20:30] behold I create new
[1:20:32] Heavens in A New
[1:20:36] Earth now this is not the future home
[1:20:38] this is a
[1:20:39] millennium
[1:20:41] right if you want that you can go on
[1:20:44] down
[1:20:45] to I'll give it minut the future home or
[1:20:49] at
[1:20:50] 60 but look
[1:20:54] going down to number
[1:21:01] 18 now remember over here it
[1:21:05] says I create new
[1:21:07] heavens and earth Isaiah
[1:21:10] 21 say and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[1:21:13] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[1:21:16] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:21:18] more
[1:21:20] seed now that's why brother R said it
[1:21:22] looks like everything is annihilated
[1:21:26] what is the first
[1:21:27] Heaven most of you know right cuz you
[1:21:30] studied the message what is the first
[1:21:33] Heaven what you saw you have for the
[1:21:35] first Heaven and the first Earth go to
[1:21:38] the next
[1:21:43] one Satan's eating paragraph
[1:21:47] 167 he talking about descending from God
[1:21:50] out of Heaven he's talking about the
[1:21:51] future home
[1:21:53] right there no more sea the first Heaven
[1:21:56] and the first Earth was passed
[1:21:58] away what was our first
[1:22:03] Heavens was the
[1:22:05] Millennium Millennium is going to be
[1:22:07] first
[1:22:10] Heaven you said the heavens is the sky
[1:22:12] and I was the first Heaven the Bible was
[1:22:15] talking about where he said I
[1:22:17] create Isaiah said I
[1:22:20] create a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:22:24] the millennial Reign is going to be
[1:22:27] Heaven ruling over
[1:22:30] Earth what was our first Heavens there a
[1:22:34] millennium what's the first Earth this
[1:22:39] now so what's going to happen in the
[1:22:42] future
[1:22:45] home in the future
[1:22:47] home all is going to be made
[1:22:51] new right
[1:22:55] because the first Heaven and the first
[1:22:56] Earth is the millennial Reign and what's
[1:22:58] taking place right now upon this
[1:23:02] Earth so he said I create a new
[1:23:12] Heaven he's going to bring the
[1:23:14] Millennium into being
[1:23:16] right
[1:23:20] right one of these days he going to
[1:23:22] create a new Earth
[1:23:24] right not another
[1:23:28] Earth that's where our minds are
[1:23:33] Tangled he's going to use this Earth but
[1:23:36] make it
[1:23:37] new we're not going to get a new body
[1:23:39] we're going to get this body redeemed
[1:23:42] right the world's not going to be blown
[1:23:44] away it's going to be
[1:23:46] redeemed proving it because the
[1:23:50] Millennium can come forth which is the
[1:23:54] first tell
[1:23:56] him now brother in the SKU and around
[1:24:00] and said if I was taken up to the Paul
[1:24:04] was taken up to the third
[1:24:08] heaven he said I believe I at least went
[1:24:10] to the
[1:24:12] first you need that
[1:24:16] quote he said Paul said he went to the
[1:24:18] third he said I at least went to the
[1:24:21] first so where' brother around go beyond
[1:24:23] the curtain of time he say well that's
[1:24:25] up to you you say well did he go in the
[1:24:27] Millennium it sound like he said he
[1:24:31] did I know we went beyond the curtain of
[1:24:36] time now I know whatever is beyond that
[1:24:38] curtain of time right now where he's at
[1:24:42] is going to be in the
[1:24:44] Millennium
[1:24:47] amen you agree right do when he said I
[1:24:50] create a new Heaven
[1:24:55] he made a place for us to go yes he did
[1:24:58] the millennial rain
[1:25:01] am the 144,000 going to be in that
[1:25:05] Millennial
[1:25:08] rign as Unix to the
[1:25:11] bride they won't be
[1:25:14] upset but neither will we be smart eics
[1:25:17] and the Lord's
[1:25:20] over will understand and so will they
[1:25:24] they'll understand then that they turn
[1:25:26] down the Plan of
[1:25:30] Redemption but we receiv received
[1:25:34] it what a wonderful thing to think
[1:25:38] about that God just didn't leave the
[1:25:40] world as he does in Isaiah but r c he
[1:25:43] starts off at the beginning ends up into
[1:25:45] the millennial
[1:25:48] Reign but you better remember what he
[1:25:51] was doing in that speaking of the
[1:25:52] millennial reign
[1:25:54] is a
[1:25:57] type brother said what we'll have in the
[1:26:00] Millennium won't go into the future
[1:26:02] home what he
[1:26:04] say there's going to be some things that
[1:26:07] won't go into the future
[1:26:09] home but remember Satan is only bound
[1:26:12] right for a thousand years I don't
[1:26:15] understand that where a child she'll die
[1:26:17] at
[1:26:18] 100 and a 100y old man will die curse I
[1:26:21] don't understand that cuz there can't be
[1:26:22] any death in the millennium
[1:26:29] come on Satan's bound can't be any death
[1:26:31] in the
[1:26:32] Millennium
[1:26:34] right maybe one of these days the Lord
[1:26:36] will show us you say well that would be
[1:26:38] the last year or two that you lived in
[1:26:40] the Millennium and then they could die
[1:26:42] this I don't
[1:26:45] know I just know one
[1:26:49] thing the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:55] will
[1:26:57] experience such a
[1:27:00] cleansing until she be
[1:27:02] qualified
[1:27:04] Amen to go to the
[1:27:07] Millennium thank you Lord why because of
[1:27:11] 144,000 are going to be
[1:27:14] cleansed so cleansed until they be
[1:27:18] qualified they going to the
[1:27:22] Millennium we don't have any scripture
