of the lord this afternoon amen um you might have your seats for just a moment i want to i want to just want to bring in a little update if the brothers in the back can can bring up the slides i don't know if y'all can see that can you all see that in the back okay all right um if you remember about two months ago i had asked for the church to if they could support i asked brother dale if he could support give a little offering to this family who had lost well just to make a long story short they had lost their child last year in november all year long the child was sick and it passed away in november and so because of them having to be at the hospital constantly and things like that they had to leave their home a lot and when they would get back to their house their house was was the people would have come in thieves would come in and taken their things their belongings not only that they even took even parts of the house as well so the brother when they got back after the the the death of their little one-year-old um he wanted to just move the family elsewhere he thought it was a dangerous area so um he wanted to build in this area so i felt in my heart to just see if we could get him a little home so i uh when we got the money i know uh you know several of the brothers they they contributed and of course the church supported a good portion of it um i sent the money about just a few days later and about two weeks later they started building the the little house so here so i told the brother i said just send me pictures and mainly i'm just i'm just interested in the final project but he just wanted to send me pictures and things during the whole process so i just wanted to show you all this this is uh as they were building um so you can see there next and so here this is where they they started uh continuing next and here they're making progress now i honestly i thought that they you know it was going to take them maybe at least a month month and a half two months to build brothers build this chair this this little their little house in like three weeks he was desperate i mean they were pretty much homeless they were pretty much homeless so that he had he had help from some family members and uh and they got down to it next here's they got the the windows up this is the brother right here next this is their little bathroom right there next all right so this is the family now they've moved in into the little the little home now next that's them it would have been four of them but they lost their little one-year-old son next foreign is there's nothing that they can say or do to to to give you the thanks for what god has uh put on your hearts there's no way to repay you and then this is just another little video um it's silent so this is what they can get for forty two hundred dollars and they're happy there it's only like two bedrooms he says now we have a little bed we he said brother luis now we have a little guest room so that when you come you can stay there take me to i'd rather be somewhere like this than any palace in the world because that that that to me is love amen amen so they they just send their thanks and i just appreciate each and every one of you for helping to contribute to that um you didn't have to but there's the fruits of it and who knows who knows maybe later on down the road that home or that that that deed could could be used for something else greater amen who knows what might come out of that out of that lineage a preacher or somebody you see and you help contribute to that and i just thank thank each and every one of you thank god most and foremost thank you brother dale for for for wanting to to help and sister peggy appreciate each and every one of you and and uh appreciate everything

amen without deacons without trustees without the ministry without without the the piano player without the ones in the back amen amen it all functions because we're all working together amen and i thank god for that and and if we put christ in the center then it all works out amen praise the lord jesus amen praise god well let's stand to our feet i don't want to forget those that cleaned the church too yeah well if we didn't have the ones that cleaned the church my where would we be [Laughter] be like going into a bathroom that smells like a truck stop all the time but we don't have to because there's some people that that help clean up and we appreciate that amen praise god let's let's uh let's just read the let's just read this scripture and then we're gonna well let's just let's just have a word of prayer before we get started our heavenly father we thank you lord jesus once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word we appreciate lord god almighty what you're doing in our midst father we thank you lord that you helped provide this little home for the brother mario and his family lord god and and certainly lord jesus they they were in in hard times father and especially after the death of their little loved loved one their father a little baby lord father but lord you made it all work out for them lord jesus and we just thank you for that father lord we commit the rest of the service into your hands we ask that you would help us to receive something lord god tonight that would uplift our faith encourage us lord to move forward lord and lord jesus may you be the speaker tonight lord god help me to yield myself to you lord god only say father god what you'd want me to say and lord you just bless your people tonight we commit this time into your hands now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen praise the lord amen we want to read here in in in mark chapter 10 mark chapter 10 starting at verse 46 very familiar scripture i just felt led to go this route amen and uh just talk about blind bartimaeus tonight amen and just kind of go in a little bit detail and sometimes we just kind of read skim over and and uh but let's let's look at bartimaeus's life a little bit more and see if we can find amen it's good that we look at ourselves at the through you know through the characters of the bible amen that's the reason why the word was written amen not just that's a that's a character on its own and that's the history of it but there's reasons why god put things in the word amen and so that's the reason why the word is a mirror amen so that you can look at it and then see yourself through that amen and see where you're failing see what you need to do see where what you need to to stop amen so so let's let's just read this verse 46 and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me we'll just stop right there and you may take your seats tonight okay there amen praise the lord amen we want to and we want to touch a little bit on faith tonight amen i'll do my best not not to keep you all out that's not my intention tonight i'm really trying to get you all early tonight amen so i want to title this tonight keep your faith on the prize amen keep your faith on the prize amen you know we hear that phrase keep your eyes on the prize amen but in this case i want you to think about it keep your faith on the prize amen because bartimaeus amen didn't have eyes he had eyes but he was blind all he had was faith and the faith was what led him to the prize amen and you amen tonight with eyes with ears with all your members intact and sometimes we whine and cry when we're supposed to have faith in god amen praise god amen so we just want to take it uh verse by verse you know i was reading um a little story about a woman named florence chadwick how many heard of florence chadwick she was a she was a swimmer in the 1940s and 1950s uh and she broke world records she was the first woman to swim across the english channel from uh from england to france and it's about 24 miles 24 miles each one way and she swim it back so she's for whatever 24-24 is 48. 48 she swam 48 miles broke broke a world record and and so she decided one day that she was gonna swim from uh uh what's called there's an island right off the coast of california and they called catalina island and so she decided she was gonna swim this eye from that from that island to the coast of california where los angeles and all that so she started one day and she got in she started swimming and the waters if you get in those waters they get they're pretty chilly and so she started swimming she started swimming and she got to i don't know maybe the it's about 22 miles from that island to to to the to california coast there she got to maybe the 17th 18th mile and she couldn't go any further she told the reporters they asked her why did you stop she said there was a there was a fog that came and she she didn't know where she was where she was going but they took her over to the to the other side to the to the land and so she got there but she decided that one day she was going to do it again and when she did it when she tried it again she finally she got it that time and they asked her and they said well why what made you what made you continue she said well i faced the same the same obstacles the same fog the same chilly water everything amen but she knew that there was land on the other side and that's what made her continue amen to pursue that goal amen and not only did she pursue it she beat the world record at that time which was a man by two hours it was because she knew that there was land on the other side amen and that's what motivates each and every one of us saints amen to continue moving forward amen above all obstacles above all fog of the devil about anything that may come into your life amen chilly waters spiritual things amen anything that might come into your life amen it's because we have a land on the other side amen we have something on the other side that's awaiting just better than every every problem anything that amen that that you can face today amen this is our land this is our land amen get that land in you praise god amen there's no obstacle amen that could face you amen oh the obstacles will come no doubt jesus didn't promise flowery bed of ease for any of his any of his followers as a matter of fact when you become a christian you sign up for hardships you sign up for for things and problems in your life amen and things that you uh uh there is there no way to avoid them but it's what you do it's your mindset it's your faith and the word that you believe amen that's gonna take you across you through that through that through those cold uh waters or through that fog amen because satan is blowing his poison breath for sure he's blowing his poison breath foggy everywhere uncertain times we've been facing uncertain times we've been facing things in the last year and a half and we don't know where things are going some say this some say that some say this amen but if we stay on the prize if we know that there's land on the other side amen amen then god will lead us through praise god and so in looking at this uh uh that example i want to to look here at uh blind bartimaeus and let's just start at verse 46 there and he says and they came to jericho and who is they it was jesus and his entourage right if you don't know what the word entourage means then yeah there you go google it yeah and his disciples and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people the bible says there was a lot of people there now jericho was one of the most popular cities at that time amen and and it was probably during this time that there was a i believe it might have been uh one of the feast days here and so there was probably a lot of people coming from a lot of from different areas amen and and there was a lot of noise i'm sure i mean you give somebody uh uh together in in a stadium or something like that there's a lot of noise you hear a lot of you you hear a lot of noise and so that's what there was it was a great number of people the bible says and blind bartimaeus the bible says they're the son of timaeus set by the side by the highway side begging amen he sat by the highway side begging amen and and it's very interesting that that it says there that uh that he was the son of timaeus usually in the bible amen when somebody uh when they say that they're the son of such and such that means that they they came maybe from uh from a from from an important type of family or or their family had some sort of influence in in in the community now we don't know a lot about bartimaeus's uh background we don't know a lot about his i mean we know some things brother branham mentioned some things regarding bartimaeus and the lamb uh but even him himself he says he's not sure if those things were true or not so we don't know too much about blind bartimaeus the only thing we know is that he was blind bartimaeus he was blind he could not see and that he was a beggar amen and and you know sometimes amen in our lives sayings we we we might be in tough situations amen where we think we don't know if there's going to be an out amen blind bartemaeus didn't know he he was god he just got accustomed to living this way amen he's got accustomed to living here's my tattered garment right here i'm just gonna pretend i'm blind bartimaeus this is all i could find around the house i'm coming back to my props again blind bartimaeus and all he had was his little garment that it's tattered i mean you see there's holes in it but here he was this is all he knew oh he knew let's just sit down a little bit arms arms and you know he'd hear that that that familiar that familiar uh sound you know somebody would feel sorry for him you know and and uh they would drop that you know that that's that sound of dropping coin you know not an eye airpod case that didn't have that but you know he'd hear that sound of of of of of coins you know and that's all he knew you know and you know what he got accustomed he he grew accustomed to that yeah he grew accustomed to this sound to this sound and coins dropping in there amen now i want to ask you a question are you accustomed to the way you're living are you accustomed to the lifestyle that you that you have amen because sometimes we have blind spots in our lives we don't see ourselves we don't see the problems that we have a man we sometimes young people especially young people see themselves through how others see them and that's why that's why they they want to you know look their best they want it there's a time and then you know at some point you just don't care anymore especially when you get married you just don't care anymore but at that time you know when you're young you know you're trying to find a husband trying to find a wife and it's all right it's no problem yeah and you're and you and you get you know you're insecure but you see blind bartimaeus was that way and all he had was just his coat you know all he had and and you know and you and all he had was just this is this was his security and he got accustomed to living that way every coin that would go in there every coin would just remind him and let him know this is all i have this is what i'm always going to be this is this is i'm never going to get out of this this is not how satan talks to us satan's talked to each and every one of us just like that amen amen and and and and and that coin amen comes through in your life that noise it's just satan you're not ever getting out of that you're never you're you're never getting married you're never going to have you're never going to get the holy ghost you're never going to get healed um i'm never i'm never going to get out of this situation i'm never getting out of the situation amen let's just continue reading here amen praise god and then verse 47 and it says and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out i want you to notice something here that it was when he heard right amen because remember he couldn't see yeah and so maybe brother branham he says it like this he said maybe there was a a kind little lady that told him they told him he might was asking who is it who what's going on something's going on he heard footsteps that were different something was different amen there was something in the air amen amen right yeah amen and he met he asked and somebody a little a kind lady might have said well that's jesus of nazareth he's passing by and you know what he's the messiah that that that was promised in the in the in in in isaiah and as soon as he heard that something sparked in him as soon as he heard that that was the messiah because he was jewish he was jew himself and he knew he was waiting for the messiah as well amen but when he heard amen that that was jesus of nazareth amen something sparked in his heart amen amen and the bible says here in verse 47 he began to cry out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me jesus thou son of david have mercy on me jesus he probably was sending him that cup jesus thou son of david have mercy on me have mercy on me because he recognized he knew he didn't see the messiah right but something told them that's the messiah amen that's the messiah i knew this thing was not going to stay on me i just amen so he began to scream jesus thou son of david have mercy amen amen amen you know what saints jesus is only going to pass by maybe once twice uh uh uh yeah you're right jesus you know we need to take advantage of the opportunities when jesus is passing by all right see blind bartimaeus he he he knew that he needed to take advantage of that opportunity but well i mean what what wha what was he gonna lose he was already blind all he had was a coat that maybe he used for a pillow every now and then or uh and that was his comfort zone that was his comfort zone and so what else is going to lose and start screaming jesus thou son of david have mercy on me amen he referred to him exactly the way he needed to refer to him because he was jewish amen right he was son of david to them amen and so he referred to him in that way so what he did is that he heard and he thought and then you know he took action he took action sometimes saints you know we hear and uh it goes in one ear and it comes out the other yeah right brother when we lease we need to take action process it you know what a thought is amen what is the word the being the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen but before it becomes a word become before it becomes a word it has to be a thought right amen god amen he had his thoughts amen but when then he spoke them amen they be they became they became into fruition amen praise god and so that's exactly what happened with blind bartimaeus here remember he didn't see he could not see so all this was being processed in his head he could still hear he could still he could still scream he could steal he still had a voice and so everything was being processed in his head amen he used what he could use at the time he could not use his seeing he could not see but he used what he had available to him amen and that's the thing with you and i saying saying sometimes we think well i'm not a good singer i'm not i'm not good at this i i can't do that i'm not this amen but just use what god has given you what you have at the moment amen to advance to the kingdom of god to advance to the next level in your life amen amen to put your faith on the prize amen amen he heard what the prize was now he put his faith in action amen praise god jesus thou son of david have mercy on me amen then you know that the bible says that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen praise god amen he you know the bible talks about the day of visitation he didn't miss his day of visitation he took advantage of his day of visitation praise god verse 48 and it says and many charged him that he should hold his peace many everybody that was going by was probably even putting coins maybe in his thing to just be quiet coin he probably probably filled up you know so many coins he had just for him to be quiet he was so loud jesus thou son of david have mercy on me be quiet shut up don't you see the master speaking don't you see the master we need to be reverence oh yeah we do it at our church this way we don't sing like that around here we don't act like that around here we do it like this so be quiet but barter mess was there to get a get his healing he didn't care how it was done at church he didn't care what happened amen he he was waiting for a miracle he didn't care what needed to happen amen he was there to get his blessing amen because he already saw it he didn't see him physically but he saw it in his by faith amen praise god and so the bible says and man he charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal in other words his screaming got louder jesus thou son of david have mercy on me be quiet jesus now son of david have mercy on me and he kept going amen do you cry out like that yeah amen somebody satan comes around you amen and tells you you're not gonna get healed you're not gonna your son or your daughter ain't gonna get saved amen you you you're not you're not going to get anywhere in life amen you're going to keep that depression in your life it's still going to be there amen you're not going to there's nothing nothing going to happen brother brother how's going to continue that way amen nothing's going to happen amen all kinds of things that he tells each and every one of us but all you got to keep screaming is jesus thou son of david have mercy on me jesus now son of david hammer hang under hang in there because the blessing is just around the corner i mean jesus was already on the scene all you got to do is just persevere stand with what you got keep continuing going to church keep reading the word amen keep staying faithful amen amen because jesus is in that scene jesus is jesus is in sight no pun intended but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me amen satan satan sometimes amen he might use people amen to squash that faith in your life too maybe through a fence or maybe through something amen somebody might say something to you amen and it just deflates you amen you got to keep going you got to keep moving on amen praise god thank you lord young people sometimes amen god god will allow you to go through situations in life amen not to not not for you to to become a lesser christian amen not to you for you to become worse amen those are stepping stones for you to get better amen everything the the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord the bible says right you believe that american amen amen do you know that jesus is passing by right or are you comfortable with the cup in your hand amen man this this reminded you this constantly keeps you reminding you of your of your problems amen people contributing into your life and throwing problems into your life and telling you satan amen he keeps contributing in your life telling you you're not getting anywhere you're not amen but jesus is on the scene brother branham says here the brothers could bring this quote up i like what he says he says in the message desperation he says desperation calls for a subject and when the subject no matter how faint it is it's if it's received it's believed right then because faith catches when desperation is pushing it i like that see and then if you mix love in there loving their mixes with it with it and brings it to it and man desperation does it and then he says blind bartimaeus caught that vision quickly amen did he want to waste any time he didn't care what everybody else was saying he didn't care what any everybody said is that all you do is just go to church is that all you do is just read the word he is that all you do amen is just pray amen every time i see you i find you reading the bible why aren't you why aren't you on on on on instagram why aren't you doing this that or the other amen it's because jesus is on the scene jesus came into my life amen jesus is in jesus is the one i'm looking for amen praise god and we look at also at the woman uh the woman with the issue of blood amen she had the same thing that that blind bottom is what else could she lose do you realize that in the bible there was nowhere written that if we touched the ham of his garment that i would be healed right it's not it was written it wasn't written anywhere in the bible but something amen a faith sparked in her amen that made it that cost her to say if i could just touch the hem of his garment i know that i would be healed i know that i would receive my blessing amen praise god and she just took action faith always puts you into action amen true faith amen true faith always puts you into action amen amen praise god let's continue in verse verse 49 and jesus watched jesus and jesus stood still amen amen and commanded him to be called so the people that were telling him to be quiet people here that were trying to shut him up were the ones that jesus used to to bring him to him was the ones that jesus used to try to bring him to jesus you see sometimes amen somebody might come in and bring a fence in your life but you don't understand sometimes god uses that person amen to bring you closer to god bring you closer to the price amen yeah well i don't know my brother or that sister offended me oh well yeah the bible says that there will be many offenses jesus promised that in a christian's life there's gonna be many offenses it's what you do with the offense is how you it's how you continue amen if you're gonna carry through and win what you what you need to get or not amen it's our attitude towards things you see it's our attitude and jesus stood still and commanded him commanded him so he commanded the devils he commands the devils to come and serve [Laughter] when they're sitting there trying to torment you commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee yeah so their their whole demeanor now changed because jesus said that you can come after they were berating him and telling boy we're trying to listen to the word now it's okay yeah jesus is calling jesus amen because when he speaks amen things change situations change amen praise god saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee amen praise god you know the bible the bible god allows amen he he'll make your enemies footstools amen and he'll allow them to just be stepping stones in your life amen praise god and watch verse 50. and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and you notice that it's verse 50. i like that it's a jubilee i don't think that's there for for for just the coincidence amen amen he's got this garment all all over him amen and and and and they told him you know they they they told him they said you know he calleth for thee come come and he he he didn't sit there he didn't sit there and and and and and wonder well should i or should i not yeah doubting i mean he didn't even even hear jesus saying it he didn't even hear jesus's voice saying it amen he just heard the people that were telling him to be quiet telling him to shut up amen we're the ones that told him and he didn't waste any time amen he quickly amen he took off that garment and the bible says and he casting away his garment amen rose and came to jesus amen amen i wonder if each and every one of us amen whatever problem that we have in our life if that's what we got to do with it just cast that thing away don't worry about it don't even think twice if god said it in his word do you believe it that settles it i'm moving forward amen i am not going to lose my opportunity amen the bible says that i will have my family amen i will receive my healing i will receive what i want amen then you just go ahead and cast that garment and receive it well my daughter or my son amen they've been lost in the world amen for years cast that garment amen praise god just cast it amen it's yours jesus is passing through amen praise god you know that coat that that blind man threw off amen it could represent a besetting sin maybe a habit in your life oh do we have habits am i the only one hey man pick brother wade has a habit [Laughter] [Applause] i'm picking on i'm picking on you again not just making y'all laugh but whatever the habit may be you know god knows yeah amen and you think i'm never going to get rid of this in my life that's right amen jesus is the only one that could take it away if you stop if you just just by faith just rise amen right rise from your comfort zone rise from that spot amen rise from that from that amen get away from that amen and just let him handle it he may just go to jesus just do what you're supposed to do amen and he will take care of the issue right there and there it could be a habit maybe it's a relationship that you're putting all hopes on amen and it doesn't work out let it go amen god has something better for you amen maybe it's a doctrine some pet doctrine that you just can't let go amen you're not gonna advance with christ if you don't let go amen maybe it's a man you know yeah man sometimes we put our hopes and trust on a man too much sometimes we put our hopes and trust on a pastor too much amen maybe it's your pastor yeah we respect our pastor we have confidence that he was he's going to see us through but he's not god right right he's not god amen or maybe he's a book in your life you see something something some something amen might be hindering you from getting up out of your out of your situation to cast that thing out and go to jesus amen you know what it is amen in verse 51 and jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that i should do unto thee now jesus knew you know that he knew what what was his problem he just passed right by him of course he saw what he did and of course he knew what he who he was amen jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that i should do unto thee in other words he wanted but he wanted blind barter mice to tell him what he wanted him to do amen sometimes we need to be detailed amen specific amen specific in what we want god to do in our lives you see oh god knows god already knows yeah god already knows but how much are you willing to invest amen in your time and your effort amen in prayer and and supplication amen and fasting yeah amen to really get the lord's attention the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight he wasn't there amen he knew exactly what he wanted right verse 32 and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith had made thee whole now when you look at that word uh i believe it's the word whole there is the greek word zozo and when you look at that greek word zozo it means physical healing but it also means healing of the soul spiritual as a spiritual healing right amen because because remember blind bartimaeus he he put jesus amen his faith amen turned up turned up because he recognized that that was the messiah that was the salvation that the jews were to receive in that day by them recognizing that that was the messiah but blind bartimaeus was was was a was a step up because he had never even seen jesus he had only heard about him and that rose his faith up even more and it was this was the same thing that jesus told the woman with the issue of blood why because it wasn't just about healing it was on who she recognized that he was and see blind bartimaeus he recognized that jesus was the messiah was the savior before he could recognize that he was his healer right you see and that's the reason why he was made whole amen that word zozo if you look it up in the greek and immediately he received his sight and watched and followed jesus in the way do you think he went back to his little corner do you think he went back him into his little cup i'm following jesus with my cup still this is how we do sometimes yeah jesus i'm following you but i still got my habit i still i still i still got my my problem with me i i can't let go i still got my pet doctrine from the baptist church i still i can't let it go yeah and jesus wanted you to just leave all that aside just let it go and follow let it go and just follow seek ye first the kingdom of god young people and all those other things that you want shall be added unto you you want a husband you want a a wife amen seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all those other things shall be added unto you you know it wasn't it it wasn't uh until you get desperate with god oh god amen and when you mean business with god that god will mean business with you man sometimes we stay in our condition and we just we just this is my life this is how it's all going to be and you don't understand god has a greater vision a greater purpose for you amen than what you think yeah you know i it reminds me one time i was in lima peru in the country of peru and i was there with brother burley one time and uh we were in the in the in the in the square there and it was cobblestones and there was catholic churches around the area and there was one catholic church it was an old catholic church and there was a lot of beggars sitting around that catholic church that's where they most of the time they congregate around you know because that's how it is you know birds of a feather flock together you know the the the the the uh the ones who had leprosy in the in the in the bible they had to hang out together because they were ousted from society they couldn't be with society so therefore they hung they hung with each other a lot of beggars as well they hung out together and you see and then they feed off each other and that's all you're going to get you're feeding off of just of of your poor miserable situation and you're never going to get past that you're never going to advance in your life spiritually or physically if all you do is here with just the ones that that's in the same situation that you are right amen get out of your comfort zone amen talk with other people amen somebody has some i believe we can learn something from everybody you know it's not just for us for and no more we can learn something from everybody but we don't want to get out of our comfort zone hey we're just so happy with right with our tattered garment yeah amen i got these coins spread all over the place but nobody can have any because they're canadian coins and coins from nicaragua [Laughter] yes anyways we were there in lima peru and so there was all these beggars are sitting around the catholic church there and uh brother burley just really felt compelled he we looked at this one one lady an older lady i mean she she had her you know she i mean she was literally you know looked just like this you know just like that and you could just look in her eyes and you could tell that she's just been through a lot you know a lady had a rough has has seen some rough days and so brother burley just felt led he said uh right next to the church there was a mcdonald's believe it or not yeah mcdonald's right next to you know they have mcdonald's but when i go to lima peru or those kinds of countries i'm not looking to eat mcdonald's i want to eat their food i get all the mcdonald's here anyway so we went into the mcdonald's and ordered a cheeseburger i think it was something for that because we wanted to give her something to eat and when i went to when i went to give it to her brother burley wanted me to interpret to her something i went to give it to her and she literally she pushed it away she pushed it aside she got up and ran and ran away from us she didn't want it and you know what happened the other beggars that were around they're like yeah we're taking that and they started they started fighting for the for the for the bag yeah and they took it and i thought brother burly and me we just looked at each other and i thought my goodness here you are you want to go help somebody and they're so they're so accustomed to their situation to their condition that when help comes along the way they don't want to receive it because it looks it doesn't look the way they think it needs to look right it looks totally different they think it needs to come a certain way then i'll receive it and what they needed at that moment came totally different she needed some food she needed some help but she didn't want it the way we wanted to give it to her yeah it was the same thing i had to mention last time when i preached the same thing with the jewish people amen they wanted the messiah but they didn't want to receive it the way god sent it to him and a lot of them missed their blessing their visitation for their day but not blind bartimaeus not blind but but the priests in the in the temple he missed the visitation amen but a blind beggar amen on the side of the road amen who never seen jesus christ physically he got his he what he was looking for amen and the lady just ran i thought what a sad situation i wonder if if us spiritually amen if that's how we are we need help we need somebody to come minister the word to us do something say something to us do something and it comes and you're like i don't know yeah that's not what i was looking for god can't do anything else for you i i wasn't going to go down brother brilliant me wasn't going to go down and chase after that lady that's what she wanted to do yeah brother dale all he can do is preach the word the minister's here all we can do is preach the word you decide what you want to do with the word it's up to you amen all we do is throw the net praise god brother amen what a sad situation it is that people don't want to leave their situation amen you know in in in the bible if uh it looks like this this same scenario is in luke if you read in luke you can also read in luke chapter 18 verses 35 through 43. that was blind bartimaeus says well we're not going to read it it's the same thing but i like what it says there the last verse after jesus gave him his his sight in verse 42 the brothers could scroll up it says it says and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee and verse 43 says and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god amen amen so all the people that were persecuting him all the people were telling to be quiet they got all nice and then when they saw the miracle they all began to praise god amen you might be going through a problem in your life somebody said something that maybe you didn't like amen but eventually it's all for the glory of god amen it's all to bring glory to and praise unto god amen it's all for his glory amen praise the lord praise god the righteous in job 17 9 the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger i like that amen praise the lord don't let yesterday use up too much of today yeah brother amen amen don't don't be dwelling about the past all the time don't do all about what what god you know this your your past situations amen just let them go amen i like this here too it says you can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one you're never going to finish the book you're never going to finish the book right amen you want to finish the book this book all this word must be fulfilled but it's got to be fulfilled through a people amen amen you being you and me be that that people amen but let amen don't let don't let the satan amen get you comfortable in your situation if you know that you can advance further in the kingdom of god my goodness i have lent in my in my mouth i wonder why yeah that's old tattered garment if you know that say you you can advance in your situation saying say man and just get up amen just a man just go you know what you're supposed to do that's right i like what i always always that always stuck to me what brother branham said he said wherever you left jesus that's where you'll find him again amen you know where you left jesus you know many times in my life it's been prayer amen and studying reading the word right i believe i i i maybe i'm the only one but you know i always say it's it sounds simple but yet it's the hardest things for us to christians to do because satan will do everything he can for you to continue your netflix to continue your instagram to continue doing other things in your life that will won't help you grow they will not help you grow i don't see how how instagram and how and how those things are going to help you get better be a better christian right man amen that's fine if you have them in your life but sometimes you know when you get into it and you realize man this is just time consuming right now you get back to prayer you come back you you you get back to believing the word you get back to doing what you're supposed to do in sincerity and you'll see things change in your life amen they happen for blind bartimaeus i know they can happen for you amen you love the lord amen amen let's enter our
