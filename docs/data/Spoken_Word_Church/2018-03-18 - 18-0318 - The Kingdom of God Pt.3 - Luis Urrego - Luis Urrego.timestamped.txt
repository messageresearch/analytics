[0:01] everybody hope everybody's doing okay
[0:07] yeah
[0:09] just for the record I'm not going to
[0:11] Afghanistan for three years
[0:13] no lady messed up my haircut so yeah
[0:21] yeah there's nothing the thing was it
[0:30] was a man's barbershop the place of the
[0:32] name of the place of demands demands
[0:34] place man's room and it all women in
[0:38] there it's not like man there's
[0:46] everything's manly I mean they got deer
[0:48] antlers coming from the wall everything
[0:50] but it was all women so she thought you
[0:53] needed that well I was wanting to go for
[0:56] a fade but not this much of a face and
[0:59] she she I showed her a picture and she's
[1:02] like well we can do something similar
[1:04] and there but but she was doing am i I
[1:06] was thinking oh she's doing what the
[1:07] pictures doing what time I looked in the
[1:09] mirror she had already gone all right
[1:20] let's let's continue with the speaking
[1:24] about the kingdom of God and also I
[1:28] wanted to uh I wanted to apologize
[1:31] lately the last two services or the last
[1:35] two Sunday School lessons I've been
[1:38] saying 3 2 1 1 2 3 what it's bothering
[1:42] me and some people some people just cuz
[1:45] I use the word heck
[1:48] so that's not that I just this just to
[1:53] me it wasn't anything bad but I know it
[1:55] could be bad for some people so I just
[1:58] wanted to apologize for that so maybe
[2:01] it's better just when the world is
[2:03] bothering me all right so we're speaking
[2:06] about the kingdom of God and we we were
[2:08] reading this Sunday this is where we
[2:10] kind of stopped that we read Romans
[2:12] chapter 14 and and so the kingdom of God
[2:16] so we're speaking about is the kingdom
[2:18] got external because we know it's not an
[2:20] external thing even though people make
[2:22] it out to be
[2:23] an external thing right but that's all
[2:26] the kingdom of God is so we read Romans
[2:28] 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not meat
[2:31] and drink these are external things your
[2:34] flesh your body means meat and drink
[2:36] right but that's why I think God is just
[2:40] above it's not meat and drink or
[2:42] physical things but righteousness and
[2:44] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's
[2:47] right that's the key point because
[2:48] without the holy ghost there's no
[2:50] kingdom of God yes right not for the
[2:53] with without without the Holy Ghost
[2:56] there's no peace there's no joy there's
[2:58] no true joy and peace and righteousness
[3:00] it's all temporary and how many of us
[3:03] you know we get caught up and you get
[3:05] caught up with the things of this world
[3:06] and you think this will give me pleasure
[3:08] this will give me pleasure this will
[3:10] give me pleasure and it's only temporary
[3:12] so all right so let's let's read these
[3:17] quotes brother Branham said in a message
[3:20] the token God's God's blood bound
[3:22] promises makes us free from sin and
[3:24] shame and different from the rest of the
[3:26] world you don't have to dress different
[3:28] anybody can dress different you have to
[3:31] be on the inside different the life is
[3:34] on the inside not dressing wearing
[3:36] the kingdom of God is not meat and drink
[3:38] or wearing of apparel but it's the
[3:41] long-suffering goodness generalizations
[3:43] in the Holy Ghost
[3:44] so ability brother Brendan the brother
[3:47] Brendan think it was all about hair and
[3:49] dress and all that stuff like a lot of
[3:51] people in the message may get off the
[3:52] beat that's part of it but the thing is
[3:55] is that but you don't have to tell the
[3:58] true point again Christian Oh sister or
[4:00] brother for that sake to dress properly
[4:03] the Holy Ghost in them will teach him
[4:05] how to because he's all about modesty
[4:07] right amen
[4:10] that's why we different with the Baptist
[4:13] Methodist so-called Calvinists they
[4:15] think of people but Calvinism is right
[4:16] then we're going to come over on the
[4:18] Armenian side what did they do it works
[4:20] what's the holiness groups works bless
[4:22] God I'll let my hair grow out the women
[4:25] and oh praise God I won't even wear a
[4:26] short sleeve shirt the man will and so
[4:29] forth like that that has nothing to do
[4:31] with the kingdom others Rama says no sir
[4:34] you can let your hair grow long you can
[4:36] wear dresses whatever you want to or you
[4:38] can do this that or the other and they
[4:40] won't have nothing at all to do with it
[4:42] you're not safe because of your clothes
[4:45] if so God would just have made some
[4:48] patterns of such everybody would just
[4:52] the brother Dale would just give out
[4:53] patterns for everybody to dress exactly
[4:55] alike and that's not Jesus wouldn't have
[5:00] have to die it was all about dressing
[5:03] him in my long hair and all that right
[5:06] right you're safe because that God saved
[5:10] you by grace and you do these things
[5:12] just an appreciation for common decency
[5:16] will tell you that you do those things
[5:19] in a preacher
[5:20] many men it's a pretty clear alright so
[5:27] now we're going to speak about being not
[5:30] far from the kingdom of God now this is
[5:33] not exactly in the kingdom of God but
[5:36] but you're not far from the kingdom of
[5:39] God I will read here mark chapter 12 and
[5:41] one of the scribes came and haven't
[5:43] heard them reasoning together and
[5:45] perceiving that he had answered them
[5:47] well asked him which is the first
[5:49] commandment of all and jesus answered
[5:52] said the first of all the commandments
[5:54] is hear o Israel the Lord God is one
[5:56] Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[5:59] God with all thy heart and with all thy
[6:01] soul and with all thy mind and with all
[6:03] thy strength this is the first
[6:04] commandment and the second is like
[6:06] namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor
[6:08] as thyself
[6:14] no matter how annoying your neighbor I'm
[6:21] not talking about just your next-door
[6:22] neighbor I'm talking about your neighbor
[6:24] at church yeah there is none other
[6:27] commandment greater than these and the
[6:30] scribe said unto Him well master thou
[6:32] has said the truth not to know this
[6:34] while he replies and describes how until
[6:36] well master thou has said the truth so
[6:39] he was agreeing with the word right for
[6:42] there is one God and there is none other
[6:44] but he so he wasn't disputing what Jesus
[6:47] was saying was correct he was agreeing
[6:49] with what Jesus was saying Jesus being
[6:51] the word he was agreeing with the word
[6:53] right and Jesus bringing the word
[6:55] agreeing with the word it was always so
[6:57] in verse 33 and to love him with all the
[7:01] heart and he continues added to this to
[7:04] this the scrub and with to love him with
[7:06] all the heart and with all the
[7:07] understanding and with all the soul and
[7:09] with all the strength and to love his
[7:12] neighbor as himself is more than all
[7:14] whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
[7:18] and watch what these replies and when
[7:19] Jesus saw that he answered discreetly he
[7:22] said unto Him thou art not far from the
[7:24] kingdom of God Ava amen
[7:26] now he wasn't in the kingdom of God
[7:28] right you know he had they had the
[7:32] scribes that the scribes knew that led
[7:34] the letter mm-hmm back and forth I mean
[7:36] they knew really well yes but that
[7:39] wasn't part of the kingdom although some
[7:41] a lot of them would think you know I
[7:42] know this word I know this by the letter
[7:44] but I'm not about just knowing the
[7:46] letter it's about knowing the life amen
[7:47] behind a letter amen
[7:49] and so jesus answered him because he
[7:53] agreed with that word you know he was he
[7:55] said are not far from the kingdom of God
[7:57] he he didn't take the the attitude like
[8:01] a lot of the other Pharisees and the
[8:03] people who would contradict Jesus you
[8:05] know and who was against Jesus he saw
[8:07] that this man had a head of country you
[8:10] know type of spirit you know like a more
[8:12] humble type spirit moon he said that
[8:15] were not far from the kingdom of God now
[8:17] brother Ben says here look I know this
[8:20] is kind of long but just bear with me
[8:22] and the letter not the little nurse came
[8:24] in to the bedside where I was reading
[8:26] the Bible and she was a new nurse on the
[8:28] floor she said how do you do she said I
[8:30] believe that your Reverend Branham here
[8:33] for a physical checkup I said I am and
[8:35] she said may I rub your back make you
[8:37] feel a little better with the alcohol
[8:38] and I said you may do it and while she
[8:41] was rubbing on my back she said what
[8:43] denomination of church do you belong to
[8:45] now people probably already stumbled
[8:47] around that first point company where he
[8:52] was standing he took it and she's a
[8:54] nurse you know woman
[8:59] you know but that's fine that that's
[9:01] okay again remember what's bad for you
[9:03] may not be back for another forever
[9:05] system you see what I'm saying hi
[9:07] brother Brenda knew where he was
[9:09] standing right all right just I was just
[9:12] wanted I'll take that back to her come
[9:14] on that Sunday mmm and while she was
[9:17] running long back she said what
[9:18] denomination of church do you belong to
[9:19] and said oh I belong to the oldest
[9:21] denomination there is and she said what
[9:23] denomination is that I said it's the one
[9:25] that was organized before the world was
[9:27] ever organized oh she said what I don't
[9:30] know I don't believe I know just that
[9:31] she said I belong to a certain church is
[9:33] that organization I said no ma'am that
[9:36] was only about 200 years ago that
[9:38] organization but this organization was
[9:40] started when the morning stars sang
[9:41] together and the sons of God shouted for
[9:43] joy when they seen the coming of a
[9:45] savior to redeem mankind and she just
[9:47] stopped rubbing my back and I was
[9:49] stopped a little over this way so the
[9:52] lady could rub it she was from near
[9:54] cordon down here and we got to talking
[9:56] and she said sir
[9:57] now this how much she replied sir I've
[9:59] always believed that if God was ever God
[10:02] he still got today just like he was in
[10:04] the old days she said though my church
[10:07] flatly denies that but I believe that is
[10:11] the truth now compared to what that that
[10:14] scribe my tech scribe replied to to
[10:16] Jesus you see she was agreeing with what
[10:18] brother Branham was saying and brother
[10:20] and sis and I said you're not far from
[10:21] the kingdom of God young woman she said
[10:24] if he ever was a healer isn't he still
[10:26] healing I said he most certainly is my
[10:28] sister so I'm just showing you these
[10:32] that your approach to the word so I'm
[10:36] gonna Center out here the way he
[10:37] approaches the word the you know
[10:40] determines how close he is or she
[10:42] the kingdom of God you know that's very
[10:44] important your attitude towards the word
[10:46] bless God I won't believe I don't
[10:48] believe that well there's no blessing
[10:51] for you then you're not close to the
[10:54] kingdom of God and you just stomp out
[10:58] another example the day after our
[11:00] meetings at Phoenix there's a little
[11:02] lady came up and said brother Branham
[11:03] since the meeting said I let my hair
[11:05] grow I said you're not far from the
[11:07] kingdom now
[11:08] she said my sister had a wheelbarrow
[11:10] full of these shorts and things she was
[11:12] going to throw them in the garbage can
[11:13] in the next sister come along and got
[11:16] them and said she wasn't finished with
[11:17] those things I said so I said that's all
[11:19] right I believe the church will come
[11:20] back to its feet someday keeps going
[11:22] like that it'll get all right I met a
[11:24] man not long ago that said why don't you
[11:26] leave off those women said well I don't
[11:28] know he said people regard you as a
[11:30] prophet I said I'm not he said but they
[11:32] regard me that why don't you teach them
[11:33] these things I received these spiritual
[11:35] gifts I said how can you teach them out
[11:37] or when they won't believe their ABCs
[11:39] you know what ABC stands for all right
[11:40] list that's the first ABCs
[11:43] lets them learn how to do and we'll
[11:45] teach them something with it you know
[11:46] and so when we get that why we're coming
[11:48] pretty close to the king okay so there's
[11:52] a sister here that because she saw
[11:54] something she wanted to get closer amen
[11:58] to the Lord she did something and might
[12:00] I might not been the new birth you see
[12:03] what I'm saying but because she said
[12:05] brother Branham I was convicted by that
[12:07] I let my hair
[12:08] he said never sir you're not parking the
[12:11] kingdom but that's not the new birth
[12:12] right that's not that's not that that
[12:15] doesn't mean that the sister was safe
[12:16] right but she might have still needed
[12:19] the new birth but she was too far from
[12:20] the kingdom and that's one here now I'm
[12:22] not a de a latter-day I'm just your
[12:26] brother I don't care whether your first
[12:27] reign second ring middle reign all rain
[12:29] or no rain it don't make these
[12:31] difference to me I love you just the
[12:33] same and we are brothers he said well
[12:35] said all this big church that our best
[12:36] members went over there I said they did
[12:38] I said what they go for us said that man
[12:40] came over and pulled him away dying to
[12:43] save us goes down
[12:45] now that's right I don't care if he
[12:47] don't know his ABCs or split peas from
[12:50] coffee let me tell you brother as long
[12:51] as he knows Jesus Christ he may talk
[12:54] through his nose and holler and now here
[12:57] he was speaking to up to a brother and
[13:00] this is what he was telling me I'd
[13:02] rather have that than all the phd's of
[13:04] denominational person and everything as
[13:06] I say I want to know God in the power of
[13:08] his resurrection that's right he said I
[13:10] guess you're about right this is what
[13:11] the person would plug back to brother
[13:12] Brown so program said you're not far
[13:15] from the kingdom now
[13:19] all right so you can you can be close to
[13:23] the kingdom but not in the king or in
[13:26] this case is the kingdom of God you see
[13:29] and then so easy for us as as as as as
[13:36] humans you know to to think that because
[13:39] this has happening in my life or that
[13:41] I'm going through this that I must be in
[13:43] the kingdom I must being in the kingdom
[13:46] but you have to be born but everything
[13:48] human spirit amen
[13:50] praise God now you know brother grandpa
[13:53] brother Dale he's been speaking about
[13:55] the new birth so how do you enter it
[13:56] into this kingdom John chapter 3 there
[14:00] was a man of the Pharisees named
[14:02] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[14:04] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[14:07] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[14:10] come from God for no man can do these
[14:12] miracles that thou doest except God be
[14:15] with him now you take you take the
[14:17] attitude that Nicodemus had towards
[14:19] Jesus could you say that he was close to
[14:22] the kingdom of God I believe he was i
[14:26] standing right in front of the kingdom
[14:29] absolutely because of the way he was
[14:32] approached I mean he he said no man can
[14:36] do these miracles God be with him
[14:37] right right and jesus answered insulting
[14:41] him he said you know he kind of didn't
[14:45] regard what he said that right there but
[14:48] he said Jesus and something fairly rare
[14:50] I sent to thee except a man be born
[14:52] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[14:55] and when you look at that word see it
[14:59] means to understand there's different
[15:01] different different uh I meant to put
[15:05] them here on the slide but different
[15:09] definitions for and things are very
[15:11] interesting to see to understand - you
[15:16] have expound expounding to you you know
[15:19] just different things so
[15:23] except a man be born again I meant so
[15:25] without the newborn birth you can't even
[15:27] understand the word you can probe at it
[15:32] you can put this scripture here with
[15:35] this scripture here and and you may
[15:37] understand it intellectually and I've
[15:40] always said this Malachi 4 came you know
[15:44] not to turn the heads but to turn the
[15:48] hearts like a lot of people have had
[15:50] their heads turned but not their hearts
[15:52] that's the reason why you see people
[15:54] leaving their head they always
[15:56] intellectual you know things that you
[16:00] know you can know this message
[16:02] intellectually you can know the Word of
[16:04] God intellectually but that has nothing
[16:06] to do with the universe it's got to be a
[16:08] revelation is right now a man mm-hmm
[16:11] it's got to be a revelation team you
[16:14] know when I when I came to the Lord and
[16:15] when I came to this messaging I really
[16:19] appreciate you know the series that
[16:21] brother Dale's been bringing upstairs
[16:23] because it's led me on about you but
[16:26] it's let me looked at my life at what
[16:29] I've experienced in the last 15 20
[16:31] almost 20 years that I've been in this
[16:33] message and in kind of pinpoint where I
[16:36] was born again where were my salvation
[16:39] took place before I reach this statue of
[16:42] the perfect man and I had never I knew
[16:45] that I experienced those things but I
[16:47] never could pinpoint it till brother
[16:49] down I just think I don't know about you
[16:52] you might think oh brother those you
[16:54] know it's just boring or dug into
[16:58] believer that's not boring
[17:04] anymore no more of that Kingdom
[17:08] a man they could demon said unto Him how
[17:10] can a man be born when he is old so
[17:13] Nicodemus is thinking that he's talking
[17:14] about natural things can he enter into
[17:17] the second time into his mother's womb
[17:18] and be born jesus answered verily verily
[17:21] I say unto thee except a man be born of
[17:24] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[17:28] into the kingdom of God now up here he
[17:30] says that man cannot even see the key
[17:32] man of God here he's I mean I cannot
[17:34] even enter into the kingdom of God right
[17:37] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[17:40] and that which is born of the Spirit is
[17:41] spirit my will not that I said unto thee
[17:43] you must be born again the wind bloweth
[17:46] where it listeth and thou hearest the
[17:47] sound thereof but canst not tell whence
[17:49] it cometh and whither it goeth so is
[17:52] every one that is born of the Spirit
[17:55] amen
[17:56] praise God so Jesus made it clear that
[18:00] in order for you to even and see or
[18:03] enter the kingdom of God you must be
[18:06] born again right and I know we do we
[18:09] know all these things but sometimes in
[18:14] our human thinking we think we could
[18:15] just kind of bypass some things just
[18:18] kind of take shortcuts you know and it
[18:23] doesn't work that way does anybody have
[18:29] any questions or anything is the only
[18:37] revelation that is in
[18:39] I don't think so is that considered a
[18:46] revelation I mean yeah they born again I
[18:51] believe so yeah I mean especially if you
[18:55] I mean because what the new birth it can
[19:00] be different for everybody
[19:01] you see I mean it I has to be by the
[19:05] word but a specific revelation that was
[19:09] specific to you you see so you know ma I
[19:16] believe I was born again in Colombia
[19:18] South America reading the message across
[19:21] the mystery of God revealed I believe I
[19:25] was the surface beginning of money birth
[19:27] and so but then to other people and then
[19:32] of course you know to other people who
[19:34] came through Pentecost you know their
[19:37] new birth was a physical experience
[19:40] right right yeah the way I think what
[19:43] she's trying to say it's gonna break and
[19:45] get a revelation if you don't say you're
[19:46] not warning you you can the other
[19:49] knowledge because at 14 years old I had
[19:52] a knowledge of my brother Brennan said
[19:54] it was just you could read and see that
[19:57] it was an apple you could read and see
[19:59] it and what an Father Son Holy Ones
[20:00] baptism well the true revelation is
[20:02] though when it takes that and it's like
[20:04] that roman candle issued you're saying
[20:06] you know we just because him prophet no
[20:10] eternal hell no father you know that's
[20:13] just a repeat of what unit in what you
[20:15] read physically but when I was born
[20:18] again in 98 all that came alive if it
[20:23] wasn't dead letter anymore because what
[20:26] it was doing even though I realize what
[20:28] it was it was condemning me Yeah right
[20:31] it was condemning me this is what was
[20:33] condemning me but the true revelation
[20:35] when I got the new birth the true
[20:36] revelation came is what I had held all
[20:39] those years came right back up just like
[20:42] the
[20:42] examples they listen to what Jesus said
[20:46] no they didn't help they weren't privy
[20:47] to have a book to have an end they just
[20:50] had to go by their memory of what they
[20:51] heard for three and a half years but on
[20:54] the neighbors and they were sinners but
[20:57] on that day of Pentecost when you guys
[20:59] save their soul changed them all that
[21:02] came back that good word that was on the
[21:06] pages I am Alive right now that was a
[21:09] revelation so you can have a knowledge
[21:12] and be a sinner
[21:13] that's what's happening now with these
[21:15] people that are preaching been preaching
[21:17] the message for thirty years right and
[21:19] now good night and just say it was wrong
[21:22] and say now they can't they couldn't
[21:26] have been born again now they could have
[21:27] been in the same spot condition and now
[21:29] the Holy Ghost annoying I probably have
[21:32] to worry about never worry about an
[21:33] anointing you feel an anointing and that
[21:35] you're born again even brother Branham
[21:37] Warner so parents but anointing ones at
[21:39] the end time is the true anointing of
[21:40] the Holy Ghost
[21:41] well now by knowing it'll hold of those
[21:42] will help you preach the word but your
[21:46] data insides don't always agree with the
[21:48] word
[21:48] I tried but then B no that's Olaf they
[21:51] never they were centers I think they're
[21:53] centers now if it wasn't there fenders
[21:55] now yeah they let that unclean spirit go
[21:57] out and then come right back
[21:59] make them religious but somewhere down
[22:02] the line some brother Dale gonna sit
[22:03] somewhere down the line you're gonna
[22:05] meet that one checkpoint that you can't
[22:08] get through and when you don't meet that
[22:10] J point then they go off and and don't
[22:12] just go into false doctrine they
[22:14] completely deny the message and do often
[22:16] you know out the world whatever else so
[22:19] you know one thing for sure they didn't
[22:21] have that Kingdom in their soul they
[22:24] might have walked in they might've
[22:26] walked close like Nicodemus you know sir
[22:29] and Jesus man said you're not far from
[22:31] the kingdom
[22:32] but now that didn't mean any born again
[22:35] even who wasn't when Paul went up
[22:38] against them
[22:40] what was his name we need the one it
[22:44] says you almost convert me Paul a great
[22:47] breakfast a great was a Jew
[22:49] Paul new vessel he addressed the
[22:51] Griffith Gribble of the Jew he knew all
[22:52] the Jewish tradition and then when Paul
[22:54] expounded them on what God had done for
[22:56] him
[22:57] I'm grateful said Paul you almost
[23:00] convert me Caldwell you know Paul could
[23:02] have said you're not far from the
[23:03] kingdom Michael he did everything the
[23:05] Jewish people told him if you know the
[23:07] tradition don't you today and that's the
[23:09] way we are we we're just traditionalist
[23:11] until the good morning that's enough
[23:13] we just have a tradition a message
[23:15] tradition long hair like you just say
[23:17] long hair long dress don't do this don't
[23:19] do that don't do this don't do that
[23:21] so a sinner cannot read the word to get
[23:24] revelation but the sinner can can read
[23:26] the word and get it an anointing but
[23:29] until they're born again they know they
[23:30] don't get it true that roman candle
[23:33] firing off revelation that all this
[23:35] comes together this yes that's true
[23:37] appreciate you clearing that up
[23:39] don't wait because no no I mean it thank
[23:41] you no you're right no not my turn but
[23:47] not because I mean when you look at the
[23:49] disciples when they went up and received
[23:52] that word that Jesus spoke to them came
[23:54] alive there in the upper room and then
[23:56] what did Peter start doing started
[23:58] putting word with word hey you know
[24:02] putting the word together and not only
[24:04] that but it gave them a boldness to
[24:07] you'll go out they were scared in the
[24:09] upper room it's right someone that may
[24:11] want to go out because they were afraid
[24:12] of the actions of Jews outside of what
[24:14] they would do but they never let the
[24:16] boldness and so the new birth will
[24:19] change you right right at the same time
[24:24] I think a a sinner like you said where
[24:27] the weight can be sanctified sure can be
[24:29] they can they can clean themselves up
[24:31] there are some there are some people out
[24:33] here in this world that have just as a
[24:35] longer hair some of the
[24:38] and dress even nicer and more cleaner
[24:40] than but uh you know that doesn't mean
[24:43] that there have the new Barbie stands
[24:44] right just cleaned up sinners right now
[24:54] alright so the word is both water and
[24:58] spirit we'll just touch on this here his
[25:00] home and Ephesians chapter five verse
[25:02] twenty six husbands love your wives even
[25:04] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[25:06] himself for it that he might sanctify
[25:09] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[25:10] by the word and now this is this is
[25:12] going back to what Jesus said if except
[25:14] a man be born of water and of the Spirit
[25:17] right the water in the spirit is both
[25:20] the same thing it's the Word of God
[25:22] right and and cleanse it with the
[25:26] washing of the water of the word amen
[25:30] John 6:63 it is the spirit that
[25:34] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[25:36] the words that I speak unto you they are
[25:39] spirit and they are life
[25:40] so Jesus clearly you know telling us
[25:44] that his words are spirit and they are
[25:46] life and they were watched by the watch
[25:48] so wherever you see a lot of places in
[25:50] the scripture where you see water and
[25:51] spirit you know wherever you see the
[25:54] water you usually see the spirit there
[25:56] or a spirit and water all tied together
[25:58] amen because you know you look at you
[26:03] look at a physical birth you know and
[26:05] there has to be water right and then
[26:08] that in that that water you know when it
[26:10] breaks that means of birth is taking
[26:13] place right wife is looking at me right
[26:18] now but we had an experience with Bella
[26:21] seen Christine we that we decided to use
[26:25] a midwife for both of our children and
[26:28] and say it was real as as real good
[26:31] no it was no she wasn't asleep I
[26:35] witnessed sleep I was there helping and
[26:38] and when we got there to the to that to
[26:42] that up to the birthing place the the
[26:46] the lady the Midwife said all right
[26:48] Lewis this things about to burst and
[26:51] just as soon as she said that mean that
[26:54] water burst it got all over Marla but
[27:23] you need to have both that water and
[27:25] that spirit that drive a man that that
[27:31] word needs to be there and so when you
[27:33] have a physical birth that water is
[27:34] there it needs to burst it needs to
[27:36] break open a meant to give way up to to
[27:39] to the life amen once the baby is born
[27:42] but you see once the baby comes out then
[27:45] the the breath of life can come into it
[27:47] right and and then you know the actual
[27:51] birth is it's the birth right you know
[27:54] that's the new birth right but then it's
[27:57] like brother Dale said says you know
[27:59] then the crying and all that that takes
[28:01] place the emotion that can take place
[28:04] after and then it's justified it's good
[28:06] because I don't know of a Christian who
[28:08] hasn't received any bird that hasn't
[28:11] experienced an emotional time in their
[28:13] life doesn't necessarily mean that you
[28:16] spoke in tongues and prophesied and run
[28:19] around the church and all that and all
[28:21] that is very good and if the Lord deals
[28:23] with you
[28:24] way you need to continue having the Lord
[28:26] deal with you that way because it helps
[28:29] us with some of us starchy people right
[28:31] and but you know when but I don't know
[28:38] of a Christian who hasn't got down to
[28:39] cry crying before the Lord and asking
[28:42] that and one in desire more variety and
[28:44] not fully understand what's going on in
[28:47] his or her life and say lord please
[28:49] explain to me and show me you know what
[28:52] it is and just crying and travailing for
[28:54] God right but but at the sinner
[28:59] you know the sinner just you know cries
[29:01] and all that - I see asking the Lord to
[29:03] forgive them you see but if that crown
[29:08] isn't the new birth all right man so
[29:13] John 664 case of Jesus continued sin but
[29:17] there are some of you that believe not
[29:18] for jesus knew from the beginning who
[29:20] they were that believe not minutia
[29:22] pretreatments and he said therefore
[29:24] sound to you that no man come can come
[29:27] unto me except it were given unto him of
[29:29] my father a man in that place I said no
[29:32] man can come to me unless the father
[29:33] draws him first from that time many of
[29:36] his disciples went back and walked with
[29:38] him no more now I wanted to leave this
[29:41] here because those disciples see Jesus
[29:44] have more than motorcycle yet cetera and
[29:50] all of them heard word only 12 stayed
[29:54] with him right after Jesus has preached
[29:57] food to the to the people if you don't
[29:59] drink my flesh to eat my flesh and drink
[30:01] my blood you have no part in me and
[30:03] these in these up these other 70 they
[30:05] thought this thing is too hard for us to
[30:07] understand so they walked away from it
[30:09] and and so the verse 16 Simon Peter
[30:16] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[30:17] thou hast the words of eternal ask them
[30:21] are you gonna go to and and we believe
[30:25] and are sure that thou art the Christ
[30:27] the Son of the Living God
[30:30] so not just believe but they were sure
[30:32] that
[30:33] I put that didn't state that me why that
[30:35] was in there no that's right they can be
[30:37] born again thank you truck that was
[30:39] confirmed in them at in the in the upper
[30:42] room I mean that was really I mean it
[30:44] was not just Jesus with them but it was
[30:46] Jesus in the man amen yeah he jesus
[30:51] answered them have not I chosen you
[30:53] twelve and one of you doesn't just have
[30:56] a devil but is it that way we know he's
[31:01] talking about Judas he spake of Judas
[31:04] Iscariot the son of Simon for he was the
[31:06] one she betrayed being one of the twelve
[31:08] amen so you can I mean these people
[31:12] right here these 70 disciples like just
[31:15] like but message believers that come to
[31:17] the message and he'll be there for three
[31:18] five six seven ten years 15 years in
[31:21] them but then almost suddens I just
[31:22] they'll hear something something that
[31:25] you know that they come out sail along
[31:27] or something so I'll say one thing one
[31:30] thing one thing one phrase so maybe it's
[31:34] a brief something and they just can't
[31:36] get it they leave or they're looking for
[31:39] something otherwise or they're looking
[31:40] for something and just to give em an
[31:43] excuse because some people don't want to
[31:46] give up certain lifestyle certain things
[31:48] in their life and so they'll take
[31:50] they'll use and something like this to
[31:53] justifiable like I came in you know I'm
[31:55] gonna continue this life moveable Saints
[31:57] the word attains you from the inside out
[32:00] Israel amen that's right you may still
[32:02] have you may still be struggling right
[32:05] mr. Luke because we're still in this
[32:06] flesh we're still pressing amen into
[32:10] this kingdom right we're still pressing
[32:12] because this thing is not born again but
[32:15] the desire of not wanting to is any but
[32:18] right now whatever it is it doesn't
[32:20] matter what you struggle with or whether
[32:21] you know we all have some sort of be
[32:23] settings in whether it's laziness or
[32:25] whatever it is right but but but the
[32:28] desire God's already put that desire and
[32:30] you do not want to that's right and
[32:32] you're not looking you're looking when
[32:34] that ministers up there preaching you're
[32:36] looking you're saying Lord changed me
[32:37] through your word that's a desirable
[32:39] Holy Ghost field Christian I want your
[32:41] word to changement but the critic the
[32:43] one who's just got mental knowledge let
[32:45] me see what I can do to criticize you
[32:47] know yeah that's that case but uh you
[33:08] know the Lord be the judge of those
[33:09] things that's wrong so amen all right
[33:18] and we'll finish with this one some more
[33:21] examples of what being the word meaning
[33:23] water I just had to have these four
[33:27] Isaiah 55 for as the rain coming down
[33:29] and the snow from heaven and return
[33:32] earth not thither but water it the earth
[33:35] and make it bring forth and bug that it
[33:37] may give seed to the sower and bread to
[33:40] the eater so shall my word be that goeth
[33:44] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[33:45] return unto me void but it shall
[33:48] accomplish that which I please and it
[33:51] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[33:52] sent any man
[33:54] that word that that was placed in the
[33:58] disciples a man was three and a half
[34:00] years and they came to fruition on pea
[34:04] Pentecost amen
[34:05] all right and same thing you know I
[34:08] really believe that in my life in my
[34:11] case my wife she grew up in the message
[34:14] right I I did I think I experienced the
[34:18] world I experienced the nomination I got
[34:21] said I've went through seven Church ages
[34:22] of different churches I know what the
[34:25] cuts the Catholics talk about I've been
[34:27] in the Jehovah's Witness I've been on
[34:29] all those things because I was with mom
[34:31] and dad so I had to follow everything
[34:32] wherever they went
[34:33] you were good yeah I was drugged good
[34:36] not because I'm Colombian that's right
[34:43] but and so the things that brother Dale
[34:47] speaks about when using the Baptist
[34:48] Church I'm familiar with those things
[34:50] because I went through the Baptist
[34:52] Church I know what they believe and I
[34:54] like what the brother Ernie said last
[34:55] night and I think another thing I heard
[34:57] you say that before
[34:58] but that is so true they believe in
[35:00] praying for the sick yeah but they
[35:02] better not get well I don't believe in a
[35:05] miracle they believe us they don't
[35:06] believe in them they did not believe in
[35:09] miracles I mean you go to a Baptist
[35:10] Church at the church that I went to
[35:12] now some Baptists they'll they believe
[35:14] in clapping your hands when you're
[35:16] singing in and things like that it's
[35:17] more of the free practice you know it
[35:21] but the church that Baptist Church I
[35:23] went it was fundamental Baptist they're
[35:25] tied in with Bob Jones University
[35:27] they don't believe a blessing everyone
[35:32] telling University there was that so we
[35:35] have known University graduates up oh
[35:38] really yeah till they set their life
[35:39] just like that and so it was strange for
[35:46] me you know when I came to Pentecost
[35:49] came into the message to see things like
[35:53] this on the wall people clapping their
[35:57] hands and and being happy and shouting
[35:59] and things like that it was a whole
[36:01] strange for me sure
[36:02] and we thought my goodness these people
[36:04] are going straight to hell yeah I mean
[36:12] that's what we thought my mom and dad
[36:14] and we thought you know but then as as
[36:16] you start seeing things more clear in
[36:18] the word and you start seeing you know
[36:20] this this is part of the kingdom you
[36:23] know the kingdom of God is it's not a
[36:25] starchy opera opera room they don't you
[36:31] say you may not have emotion right now
[36:32] but I believe you'll have emotion at
[36:34] some point yeah you might as well just
[36:37] start getting happy now yeah I'm excited
[36:40] in the word I mean because and I know
[36:43] brother Dale you know he's used to you
[36:45] know and the way we Minister the word
[36:49] here it's in the teaching form so we
[36:51] want to pay attention we want to listen
[36:53] there's times where we
[36:55] we should just let the spirits where I
[36:57] am at be happy because I'm in theirs
[37:00] it has to be a balance a viewer has to
[37:02] be a balance oh no no I just so much
[37:04] start you nicely and but there has to be
[37:07] a balance you know just bring that
[37:09] together I'm in would be a super Church
[37:13] I'm not saying that you know I'm not
[37:15] trying to be critical but I'm in you
[37:18] know at the Baptist Church you get a
[37:20] little bit excited and people would just
[37:21] look back at ya the same thing in some
[37:24] message churches so anyways should we
[37:29] get going good I'm not throwing anything
[37:34] all right but uh
[37:37] all right so we'll just stop we'll just
[37:40] leave it there anybody have anything you
[37:42] say and before we go we gotta do some
[37:49] scheduling adjustment brother Jones
