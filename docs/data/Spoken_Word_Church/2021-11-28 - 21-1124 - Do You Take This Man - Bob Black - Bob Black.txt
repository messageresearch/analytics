want to see him tonight you come expecting tonight i want to take a little topic from romans chapter 7. of verses 1 to 6. it's good to be in the house of the lord in the almost the middle of the week and since we're almost i we're almost at a thanksgiving i i've been meditating on a little a little uh sermon that brother brown preached and and then realized that he preached it at thanksgiving so it all it all kind of fits in together we've got a lot to be thankful for and i think one of the one of the most things that we've got to be thankful for is that we've heard a message that takes us straight to christ that we can look into the bible know what we're reading about right so let's read well before we read let's go to the author in prayer lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather around and and look into your word lord and and read the the things that have been written about you lord jesus and i pray god that lord that you'll just give our give our open our eyes of understanding tonight lord jesus and give us something to fight this battle with lord something to strengthen us with lord god that when we leave this place lord we'll we'll we'll know a little bit more about what we're doing here and where we're going and and and what our purpose is lord jesus and granted lord jesus said you'll just bless your people now as we read read your word be with us this after this tonight or we pray in the name of the lord jesus so romans chapter 7 says now now this is maybe a strange topic but i'm going to preach on do you take this man and you can continue the phrase do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband do you take this man and maybe just uh you know every every uh when there's a wedding ceremony conducted there's there's always a minister doing the the wedding and and maybe just kind of setting your mind uh thinking about a wedding ceremony tonight and romans chapter 7 verses 1 to 6 says know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth as long as he lives but if he's dead then he's the law doesn't have dominion over him anymore for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth should be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she'd be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god so who we're getting married to we're getting married to christ for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be said to see to the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now thinking of about thanksgiving and everything and you know thanksgiving started off with it it was kind of an institution that began with the pilgrim fathers coming over from the new world and the reason they came over was because they they they came from a front came from another land where that was restricting the way that they worshipped the the king of england would put in restrictions about how they could do things and and they were they began to be held accountable for treason and began to be accused of not worshiping right because of they didn't worship according to the way that the government wanted them to worship and so they got on some ships and they set sail for a new world and then you could think about all of the the travel and all of the seasickness and coming over to a new world and looking back and thinking i'm never going back and to them that world that they left was dead and they were they were never going back the people that they left the families that they left even if you if you wrote a letter you might never hear from the people again it might not even be a way to write a letter you couldn't make a phone call back then or get on the internet and send an email and so it was it was it was gone to them they were going to a new world and now brother branham said he said the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their newfound way of life being separated from the old english denominations and creed and they could marry now think about this now the topic do you take this man they could marry to the new anointed word for their age because when they came over now they had liberty to worship in whatever way god wanted him to worship they could they were free you think think about the liberty that we have with the message that that there's no governing body over us there's no there's no somebody that we have to report to there's no gov there's nothing that dictates how we worship the only thing that dictates how we worship in the message is the guidance of the holy spirit we're under the freedom to worship and the way that god wants us to worship we don't have to report to nobody we don't have to give a report of this or that but we're under freedom we have the freedom like the pilgrims did when they left everything their old man was dead and they came to a new land to worship in the way that god wanted them to he said they can marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word of their age for their day so can we be thankful as pilgrims like abraham separated ourself from the things of the world all of our associates we've left it all behind it's all become dead to us everything our old way of life our old nature it's gone and now we can become married to christ and he said abraham was a pilgrim he said god has separated us all from the dead religions i'm speaking across the nation now all the dead creeds and to what separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day and he said they could marry that new anointed word and now we are at that same place where we can become united with that word now you think about a marriage ceremony you think about now when the minister's up there mary and the couple and the couple the groom and the the bride and the bridegroom they're up there and they're they're in a little doing the ceremony but there's a lot of things that happened to bring them to that place there was that was the first time that that couple met that was the first time that that man met that woman and he said and and they they began to start a relationship you want to go on a date with me you want to go out and and and get some food or whatever and they begin to the relationship began to evolve and there might have been some disagreements and things and but you see it was a process something something happened until one day it came to a place where the man got down on his knees and says will you marry me and she said she'd say yes she had she had the opportunity to either say yes or no and if she said yes then that started a process that wound up with them two there standing before the minister and the minister will well as over the course of the ceremony he'll ask for all these different things is your old do you have any living husband do you and if all the requirements are met if every requirement is met then he'll ask for a token and he'll slip it on her finger and then pronounce him married and he all these things all these requirements of the marriage ceremony brother branham outlined that those things the marriage certificate and the token and the ring and the requirements of the old man being dead all of those things are being played out in your life you see it now a marriage a marriage is a union now i'm talking about a real marriage we know that there's a lot of times in the natural when a man and a wife will come up and they'll want to be married and everybody's looking at that marriage ceremony thinking people in the congregation think well i know he he's cheating around on her and i know all kinds of things and that's not the kind of marriage that i'm talking about i'm talking about where where they're where they come and and they're standing before the minister and they're they have confidence in one another now see there's there's where you got a real marriage union a real union where the wife can look with the husband and she's got trust in him she believes that he's going to provide for her that he's going to be a good provider that he's going to take care of her and he's looking at her with confidence that she's going to have a character of a good christian woman and know that that she's going to raise up the right kind of a children then you've got a real union now a real union in the spiritual though a real union and talking about the spiritual is where the bride and the groom are not they're so united that they're not even one word off they're so united that he can look at her with trust and she can look at him with trusts because they're so united that they believe the same thing they're thinking the same thing they're doing the same thing they have become so united until they're one there's not one word off that's the kind of union that is an invisible union a union that you can't see with your natural eyes but something invisible has taken place where god is uniting himself with his bride that's why jesus said brother brown said jesus answered him saying it is written in luke chapter four it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god every word of god is where we get our life from our sustenance from and that's where the bride will get her life from us from by every word of god every word of god and brother random said i hope you don't mind that i'd like to quote brother brown i believe that god has given us the gift of a man in this last stage that god could speak through and i'm not ashamed to quote things from what he said because everything that he spoke to us you could take it straight back to the bible and identify it with the bible we're not we're not quoting from a man that just made up stuff but the things that he spoke of you could take it back to ii peter and first peter and ephesians 4 and revelation 10 and mark malachi 4 and take it out run it all the way through the bible because we haven't heard a message from jeffersonville we've heard a message straight from the throne of god and i'm not ashamed to quote from the bible from the message tonight and he said there will be a bride there will be a bride to prove to satan that she is not like eve there's going to be a bride to prove to satan that that eve was not able to go she was not able to just stand on every word but she doubted it where did she fall she doubted hebrews 13 8 that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever but brother brahma said that there's going to be a bride that's going to prove that she is not y'all excuse me she is not that type of a woman he said she will be tried by his word the bride is adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride do you realize why we're called the bride because the bride the bride is going to be married to the groom it's it's going to be a a union together that you it's a wedding that's being performed a wedding where the bride and the groom are coming together you're being married to christ how are you being married because you fulfill all the requirements the old man is dead it's all is every requirement has been met and brother said she has come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word not just denominational truth not just part truth not just not just some man's idea some man that you got to go report back to the to the to the overseer of the methodist church of the overseer of the presbyterian church to find out what you believe or the pope or some some man to find out what you believe but we get our word direct from the bible that's what we believe every word straight from the bible in the beginning of the bible man was given the word of god to live by one word misinterpreted by a man called satan and a person of an animal called the serpent satan and this person could talk to eve and miss it that's that's straight out of the bible that that beast came and talked to eve satan in this person could talk to eve and misinterpreted the word to her was lost see it must be every word and christ is going to have a bride he's going to have a bride that takes the word over the world takes the word over everything else takes the word over her own ideas takes the word over everything that you can throw at her now see paul here in romans chapter 7 has given an illustration in our scripture brother brown said about the law about law and grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce now he said now i'm not don't get nervous here i'm not preaching on marriage and divorce but he said it pertains to like marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce that we as a church cannot can no more be married to the world and to christ we can no more be married to the world and to christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it than it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband if you want to be completely united with christ it's time for all that to die away listen all of the hollywood all of your all of your old desires your own nature all of the things that you used to believe all of the denominational idea all the things that you used to think in your own mind as you study the message all of that thing that was wrong has got to be dead that you can be united with christ he said it's given an illustration but i believe brother branham said i believe also is to my belief that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of prophecy what mystery could that be as paul was preaching here in romans 7 7 about being married what mystery could it be now you know you know when a normal wedding when when everything's set in a ray nobody sees the bride until it's time it's time for the marriage to to take place and the minister's standing up there and the and the and the bridegroom stands there and and everybody all the congregation is laid out and then they begin to play look we'll say a trumpet blows a trumpet blows and here comes the bride to be presented now you could take that back to joel in joel chapter 2 verse 15 and 16. it says blow the trumpet in zion we quote that scripture a lot do do you remember why it says blow the trumpet in zion blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly now now again i'm talking about this mystery he said it unfolds one of the great mysteries of prophecy in joel chapter 2 it says blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people gather the people to the wedding sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breasts everybody's come to see something happen and what's happening he said let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her claws it it's time for the mystery to be revealed it's time for the bride to come forth out of her closet we know that maybe nobody knew what was happening something secret something mysterious but then all of a sudden the bride begins to come marching down the aisle why because the trumpet has been blown the trumpet has been blown that something's taken place what is it it's the union of the pride of the bridegroom now but when brother branham was preaching this sermon the invisible union of the bride of christ he began to he began to he shifts gears in his spots and he begins to talk about he begins to talk about dwight moody going and he's talking about he was reading about romans 7 the same verse the same chapter that i just read about and he began to read about law and grace and he ran down in the street and the first man he met he said do you know grace that why was brother branham saying that do you know grace because he's talking about a person he's talking about the bride he said do you know grace he said the man replied grace who and he said the grace of god the grace of god applied do you make what does that make you it makes you mrs grace and he starts talking about do you know mrs grace the elect lady there's a lady that grace has been applied to a lady that didn't do it by our own works but the grace of god has been applied to her and here she comes walking down the aisle to be united with her husband he said it's so thrilled and when he's seen what how grace had separated from us from the law and what part grace played for us by grace we are saved not by what we can do what we can whatever we do is not counted to us grace is what saves us by grace are you saved through faith it was grace grace crack the word of the lord and his room will grace grace to the headstone it's been graced all the way grace is going to unite you grace is what saved you and he said may i add to this woman grace may i place her in the bible also is called the elect lady this misgrace i'm going to talk about no the bible declares said to the elect lady that if you notice elect come from the word elected lady one lady amongst all the other ladies was elected like the virgin was to bring forth the body of god on the earth she was an elected woman god chose mary and also god has chose an elected lady which is his bride we're talking about us do you know grace and i'm looking at grace now i'm looking at the effect that grace has had on people's lives i'm looking at something that you didn't do by yourself you didn't deliver yourself from all that stuff of your old life all that that's now dead but it was grace the grace of god applied to your life and romans 7 takes an illustration of how she was brought to him and where she would come from how she was brought to him how she wound up at the platform how she wound up the altar there before the minister in the marriage ceremony where she come from you think you think about where she come from matters you think about that story of isaac and rebecca there where she finally met him but she came from somewhere she came from a place where she heard the messenger the messenger gave her a word and said will you follow me and she watered the camels she watered the thing that was going to take her to her isaac and she got on the camels and she rode and rose through the desert where you come from and how you were brought to it matters you've come through a journey just like any bride and any bridegroom you've come through a journey and now it's the uniting time and invisible unions something taking place rebecca had listened to the messenger she watered the camels and she left everything behind it was dead to her she left everything behind just like the pilgrims when they landed on plymouth rock she left everything behind just like every other type in the bible ruth in the bible all the types that you could go through leaving everything behind and you left everything behind the only way that you can be united to christ as if you leave everything behind leave it all day and bury it in the ground bury it so it when you poke at it and pry it it ain't coming up again it's got to be dead romans 7 let's read it again wherefore my brother and you also become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who was raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the moses of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve a newness of spirit and not an oldness of the letter do you know what it means to be delivered from the law the law is the judge you're judged constantly the finger pointer saying you broke it you broke it here you messed up you broke it but you've been delivered by the law because the by the new birth by the grace of god you've been made perfect you've been made perfect that nobody can point a finger at you because if they do he's looking at you through the blood and you've been made perfect by his grace his grace is what makes you perfect and she went on a voyage rebecca went on a forge and she didn't give up she didn't give up she didn't surrender she stayed on that voice she stayed on that cam and camel that she had watered until she got to the end of the journey where she met isaac and by the time rebecca met isaac she knew him she knew who she was going to meet she knew him but by the time she got to him she knew about his characteristics about his makeup what he liked and what he didn't like but she like knew whether he liked coffee or tea what she what he liked in his drink what all the things about him she knew because she knew he she had been taught and she had been instructed and this bride the spiritual bride will be no different by the time we see him in the air we'll know him so perfectly we'll know him because we've we've learned about him it's been revealed to us we've heard about it we've heard by a messenger and we know who we're going to be joined to we know our god like rebecca knew isaac we are not worshiping in the altar of some unknown mysterious god but we know our god we know in whom we have believed we know who we serve you know if god wants you to worship him if god wants you to worship him he'll make known to you where you've got to worship him at he'll tell you how to worship him what's your worship and he'll make himself known to you if you'll let him and brother i'm in the feast of trumpets he said and how the people that's believing in them know it unless they're constantly in the words how in the word how will you know him unless you're constantly in the word to know what he is to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god now now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed husband the revealed word that's why this has to happen now he said the church here in illustration that we got in view is illustrated by a woman which a woman is always the type of the church because the church is considered a bride and god will have a bride that is in subjection to his headship could you imagine could you imagine i know there's a lot of cases where this is true could you imagine a woman that was not in agreement with her husband there's a lot of cases in the in the world where that this is true that we know just observing your friends and the family and and people at work and think we know that there's what a sad thing for a man and a woman to get married and constantly be fighting every decision that has to be made you're constantly constantly at odds whether or not to have one bank account or have separate many times people have divide up their bank accounts because they just can't become they just can't be become in agreement i'm i'm speaking spiritual now i know this kind of hits it in in the natural realm a little bit but i'm talking about spiritual how can how can christ and his bride they can't be in union if they're a disagreement if they're in disrespect you've got to be in agreement with the word when you look into the bible and you wonder i i i wonder if this is true that how can god be united with you if you wonder if his word is true if you wonder if the message is true if you wonder if what the preacher is preaching about if you're if you're not in subjection to the word a woman a a man that's trying to set a standard for his home and he says that we've we've got to dress like this we're going to church on sunday and his wife is constantly well i'm not going to church they're not in union they're not in unity and why because she's not in subjection to the word a real christian woman is going to be in subjection to a real christian husband because she's going to be in subjection to the word to the word now a man tries to set a standard and you see what that's what exactly what happened in the garden of eden the serpent came around and it began to betray eve began to slip away from the trust that she had in her husband and she began to think that maybe her husband wasn't telling her everything maybe he wasn't telling her the whole story and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god nothing no then the day ye thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil wow i'm gonna know more i'm gonna know more than everybody else that sounds like a great plan a great idea to know more than everybody else to not be in subjection look at look at the characteristics of that woman brother branham said look at the characteristics she thought she was right she thought she was right how many people in the world today think they're right and they're going around into delusion and he said he began to explain how you can't tell people you can't tell anybody anymore because they think they're right a woman that thinks she's right well i know i know i'm right i'm not going to church i'm not i'm not doing i'm not submitting to the standard that god's word requires i'm not going to do that she's not in subjection to the word and if you're not in subjection to your husband you're not in subjection to the word i said i'm talking about godly husband i'm not talking about a bunch of trash like driving home driving home one night do i do i have permission to get a drink do i have permission to get a bag of doritos i'm hungry that's a bunch of tommy rod i'm talking about the truth i'm talking about real real christian submission and subjection where you're in subjection because you love one another because you have trust in one another because you trust your husband that's the kind of subjection i'm talking about when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise tree to be desired to make one know something more more than everybody else she took of the fruit thereof and then eaten gave also to under her husband with her and he did eat how many times have we seen that kind of that played out a woman that wants to tell tell her husband how he should be running in his affairs and tell her tell him tell him how he should be how she should be conducting his spiritual life well i don't believe we should go to church over there i think we should go to church over there and he runs along with her like a like a little dog on a leash because she's not in subjection to the word let a man be have a rulership over his house listen this ain't politically correct but it's biblical biblically correct and i believe in the truth of the gospel if we know the truth we are obligated to preach the truth we're obligated to speak the truth we have the truth and let's live the truth how can you be united to your husband if you're not united every word one word often sometimes it might hurt and scald a little bit but it's still the truth and it'll do you good it's still good medicine even if it hurts going down he said she stepped out this is what eve did she stepped out from behind the protection of the word she was no longer in subjection to the word first peter chapter 3 says for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands and subject that's how they adorn themselves you see a good christian lady in subjection to her husband she's not even really in subjection to his maybe maybe strange ideas and the strange political views and all that but a godly woman is going to be in subjection to the word the standard of the word that her husband is trying to set forth he said even as sarah obeyed abraham calling them lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement subjection what how how do we subject yourself what are we subjecting ourselves to we're subjecting ourselves to the word to this bible when the bible says something we it might hurt it might scald us a little bit but we yield ourselves to it and we lay our own will down at the altar like like christ himself did in the garden of gethsemane and said father not my will be done father not my will but thine be done thy will be done we're looking for his will we're looking to lay down our own will and obey what he said that's what subjection is there at the altar of the marriage union the woman is in subjection to the husband subject subject to us to subject oneself to obey to submit to one's control to yield to one's admonition or advice to obey to be subject subject to a godly man that's what i'm talking about i'm not talking about a man that's like a neanderthal with a great big old forehead going around i bless god i i know what i'm doing and doing all sorts of sorts of strange things bless god i i know we need i know we need to put the kids through school but i'm going to spend everything every bit of money we got on a big old giant truck bless god making all sorts of strange decisions listen we're talking about the word being said is subject to the word subject where the wife can say well if a woman says i i don't understand why she go why we should go to church i don't understand why what i'm wearing matters i don't see the problem with that i don't understand why this and i don't understand why that you see that's not being unders in subjection you see what's happening to us as we've received the word at first we didn't understand and maybe we pushed back it a little bit maybe we argued with it a little bit i don't i don't understand why this i don't understand why we need to understand the statue of a perfect man how about this i don't understand why we need to know daniel two weeks i don't understand why all these things are important i don't understand what adoption is about i don't understand but one day as you kept feeding you begin to understand why because the word is claiming your life it's taking you over it's uniting him with yourself it's uniting it's uniting you with christ subjection what is subjection subjection is understanding it's understanding and when you don't understand subjection is trust when you can trust your husband knowing i'm talking spiritually now when you can trust your husband knowing that even if you take somebody out of your life and they die to go in the grave before their time you're trusting him even if you don't understand even when you get sick and you don't understand why you got those problems in your and your in your belly and in your feet and your hips you're trusting him even if you don't understand that's what subjection is subjection and eve stepped out from subjection to the word eve stepped out what is subjection my husband is my protector he means what he says i've got confidence in him he's reliable and faithful to do all that he promised i know that his word is true i believe that whatever god says is true and i'm clinging to his promises even if i don't yet see them manifested that's what subjection is abraham was in subjection when he was promised a child and he walked and he walked and he didn't see that child but yet he had trust in god that god was going to bring it to pass he was in subjection to the word he was in subjection when he took isaac up on the mountain and he offered him he was ready to bring that knife down because he was a subjection to the word subject you see we're not in we're not we're not preaching something where you've got to be you you've got to be like some kind of a prisoner or something it's a it's a prison of love we're we're changeable just like a man and a woman there at the altar she's in subjection to him because she loves him because she believes him because she trusts him because she understands him that's what brings subjection i'm talking about a real godly subjection not all this tommy rock that's been preached for years but a godly loving subjection he stepped out from subjection to the word and what did it do it threw her into nakedness and debauchery and carnality it threw the whole earth into sin and all the while the whole while she believed that she was right she believed she was right and genesis 4 1 says i and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten i have gotten a man from the lord and we know that all life comes from god but i believe that there's an underlying meaning there she was preached he was preaching something she was crowing a little bit you see all this has happened y'all thought i was wrong but really really now i have gotten a man from the lord see all this time y'all thought that it wouldn't work out right but it did didn't noah did she even even even in that sinful condition that she was living in were hurt now she recognized she knew she was naked which before she had been covered by covered by a veil of god and all that look look at the world today where people living in nakedness and living in debaltry and they don't recognize that they don't recognize that there's something wrong and they think that they're right we've got to be in submission to our husbands a woman that's not in submission to her husband i'm gonna read this this is scalding hey thank you brother louise is your life worthy of the gospel brother braham said i was preaching the other night somewhere about women to obey their husband that went out of the marriage ritual a long time ago but they ain't going to do that no sir it's went out of the marriage ritual because people have gotten so wound up in what's politically right what's what's modern what's correct what's correct and what's correct now is nobody needs to be offended everybody's right nobody will be offended and he said they live in america and they let you know so they're not going to obey they ain't gonna obey but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a christian because you're not right now you think about that a woman that will not be in subjection to her husband i'm talking about the the word the word over her house that won't be in subjection to her husband is not a christian he said i don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of god out of the will of god i hope i hope i'm preaching this with a balance tonight i i'm not preaching some kind of tommy right where your husband's gotta like hold an anvil over your head constantly threatening to drop it if you don't do everything he says but i'm talking i'm talking about i'm talking about holding the word of god the word of god over your home you've got to be in subject to that when the man says we're going to church when the man says let's pray when the man says we're going to we're going to have we're going to put god first in everything we do when the man says let's turn the tv off when the man says let's kick the tv out and the woman's not in subjection there's something wrong the man this is this is a preaching to the men too what where is the man in the message where is a man that'll set a standard for your home set a standard where you're gonna put god first over everything else that's that's the way to have a real christian home is to put god first over your children over your ch of your wife to love god more than you even love your wife to love god more than everything else put him over you you even think about us ministers when we go to study we've got to devote ourselves to the word of god and prayer we can't we don't have time to be to be attending to every need and every everything that maybe our wife wants us to do because we're laboring to bring something to the church we're putting god first you've got to put god first to this might bore you and put you to sleep a little bit but it's still the truth now he said he said watch the conditions and the conduct of women and you'll see where the church is watch the conditions of the conduct of women and you'll see where the church is you watch everything in the natural how it's happening in nature and watch it it sure runs with the spiritual also now if you'll see the conduct of women in the world today watch the conduct of the worldly church today just watch of course now there's the conduct of the spiritual bride the church see watch that also they see watch the character the character when you see women going on the rampage just doing anything they want to do watch the churches doing the same thing and you can look out on the in the world and see women women are just dressing anyway thinking anything doing whatever and the church the church is doing the same thing the church world has begun to do the same thing where they preach whatever they don't they're not concerned with truth they're just concerned whatever whatever matches up with their denominational idea they don't and you can't tell them he said you can't tell a woman of the world you can't tell the religious church world we see the church natural in your intellectual gospel going further and further away from the word we find that the women of the world on the streets members of such is carrying themselves in the same atmosphere and you can't tell them they've lost all sense of common decency that people have do you realize what a great gift it is to even to be able to receive any any kind of correction because the world can't receive correction anymore you tell somebody why don't you go to church what don't you don't you need know that you need to you need jesus nobody wants correction anymore nobody even wants correction in the natural he said it's got plenty to eat plenty to wear fine churches big places find educated ministers and so they don't need nothing else but you don't know the scripture said you are naked miserable blind and don't know it don't know it and you can't tell them no different he said in investments what if you met such a person as that and they would turn around to you and tell you to tend to your own business they don't even know that they're in that condition now if you're that way and know it it's not too bad if you know you're in that condition you can do something about it but when you are that way and don't know it that's the bad part you can't tell them people that you can't tell the church world that you can't tell women that you can't tell but the spiritual church the spiritual church is somebody that can be told told by the word told by a minister preaching the truth told by the word because the real bride is going to line up with the word the lamb's wife is going to be lined up with the word he said watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word what kind of a revival people were looking for a revival or ever the whole building is in it just in a great uproar and people running down the aisles but this kind of revival is a different kind of revival it's a revival where the individual is lining up with the word in an invisible union something invisible taking place a revival a personal revival think about that a personal revival where you could be having a revival and the person next to you don't even know what's taking place the word begin to quicken in somebody's heart and something something something's happening a personal what is it you're getting under headship subjection to the word a word revival which is why joel in joel chapter 2 said the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the i'm going to restore you shall eat plenty and be satisfied you're going to eat in plenty because it's a word revival everything that you have need of you can just eat and eat and eat and what what happens what's the effect of that revival you begin to line up with the word you begin to line up why does brother brown say all this kind of stuff let me just pause so so you don't get tired on me why was he talking about lining up because as you line up things are dying things are leaving and when things are dying right when things are leaving your your life then you're you're uniting more and more with him he said you notice when the people begin to try line with the word there comes a fresh message from the word of the word of god right straight to the people and they catch that message they catch that word and they line up in luther's day they lined up with this message and wesley he preached a message of sanctification and they lined up with that and pentecost come with the restoration of the gifts and they lined up with that well what when the message the message that reveals the full bible from end to end the fullness the headship what are we going to do with that we're going to line up with it we're going to receive it we believe it and we're going to line up with it the elect of that day and then faded away went right back off into nominationalism and went right out with the rest of them all of them right down the line but the church lined up with it the bride lined up with it god has sent us a message of full restoration to give us power what power is his word he's given us his word the power to line up to line up totally and completely with his word so that we can be united with him because if her old husband if a woman's old husband if her old husband is dead her old life her old nature her old desires her old beliefs all that is gone if all if she's in total subjection and all that old life is dead there's nothing there's no impediment to a lawful marriage the bride and the bridegroom standing there ready to be married and the minister says in this holy state these two persons come to be joined if there is anyone here that can show a just cause while they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony do you now speak or from here for here after forever hold your peace is there any reason why these two cannot be joined together is there a living spouse is there in other words if there's anything that's still alive in that person's life they can't be joined together the old nature's got to be dead the prophet paul here saying that a woman can't remarry until her first husband is dead she cannot remarry as long as her first husband is living she by no circumstances at all she must remain single as long as her husband is living she can't be married to a denomination and be the bride of christ at the same time she's got to be dead to one or the other the law says so here he said there's plenty of laws in god's word and that's his law paul's speaking the same thing here she cannot be married to a church of worldly creed and be the bride of christ because one is contrary to the other she can't be married to her old idea she can't be married she said say well we believe this but we don't believe that if you're married to christ christ is the word of god i hope tonight that this brings you confidence that something's taken place in your life that you can look back and see parts and pieces falling away dead in your life and you're as you're going along like maybe rebecca looking back and as she was riding those camels and realizing that there's a change taking place in her life until when she finally met isaac she was in harmony with him she was in unity with him he said if you're married to christ christ is the word christ was the living word he always was the word he is still the word and you can be joined with that word you've got to be dead you say it's fine for me to come to party on saturday go to party on saturday and come to church on sunday oh something's something's not dead something's not as long as i as long as this feel as long as i can feel his presence i'm all right now well now there's something quite not right there that oh the doctrine of one god isn't so important it is not so important well something's not dead yet it's important it matters what you believe oh the doctrine of baptism in jesus name isn't so important or how about this i i went fishing with brother branham so i know i'm all right see all these old ideas you got to lay down those old that's got to be dead i went fishing i know i know people that hung out with brother branham well that's got to be dead because you've got to know christ there's no there's no other absolute outside of christ you can't even have and you're absolutely not even the things that you read off the page it's got to be revealed to you unders you say understand i understand why revelation ain't so important i don't why do i need a revelation something's not dead yet something not and you see you come to church and you get poked out a little bit by the preaching of the gospel and something rises up that shows that it's not dead yet when you poke at it and it rises up and flares up well you can't tell me you're not in subjection yet you're not in subjection to your husband you got to come to a place where you're not saying you can't tell me what i can believe you can't tell me what i got to do you got to be in subjection and then you can be united with your husband you say it don't matter what i do as long as i say i believe but it does matter you see there's something that ain't quite dead yet you got to be dead you got to lay that old man in the ground cause you got to be dead because it can't meet you can't mix the old man and the new man it won't mix you can't hybridize it you can't mix denomination creed with the word because they're too contrary one to the other that's why jesus taught that parable he said the lord said if you had faith as a mustard grain of mustard seed a grain of mustard seed and brother ryan said mustard seed cannot be hybridized it can't be hybridized it's faith that ain't mixed with nothing else let's sit on that for a little bit now that's what believed the signs said they they did all their research in the on believe the sign website they said they said well that brother ram was wrong there because we found a type of mustard seed that can be hybridized well i was reading online this brother that was on facebook he got and he did some research on it and come to find out that that mustard seed that they found out could be hybridized was a genetically modified mustard seed that they got in there and tweaked the jeans a little bit so that it could be hybridized but real original mustard seed cannot be hybridized now you see that's what the website's like i'm gonna hit that a little bit the website's like that like believe the sign are like that because they put a bunch of nonsense out there that that if you just really sit down if you've got the time and the common sense and and the effort and you want to put the effort into it you can easily prove out point by point i i got to read i sat down one one day and i just began to read through all the stuff on believe the sign and i went through i said well that's easy to say to disprove that's easy because if you know what you're talking if you understand if you know you're god then that stuff ain't going to shake you i'm sorry it's not going to shake you if you know you're god you remember when jesus asked the question of his disciples he said who do you say that i the son of man and and they all i well some say this and some say that but then he turned to peter and peter knew so you see sometimes if you want to get the right answer you need to find somebody that knows what they're talking about and maybe this sounds a little bit arrogant and boastful but i believe there's people in the message today that know what they're talking about and if you want to find out the truth hold one of these people out go to ask them some questions and some of the tomfoolery that you'll find out on facebook and you'll get a real answer you'll get a real answer like jesus got back from peter when he said thou the christ the son of the living god if you ask somebody that knows what they're talking about you get an answer he said that's what creed has done tonight denominations separated the people from the word of god didn't jesus say when he said when he come you through your tradition have made the commandments of god of no effect to the people we have separated the people so by denomination that they cannot have a chance to see it that's what exactly what satan tried to do with his intellectual concepted eve he said see we said we so many times we try to figure it out with our intellectual conception we try to reason it out and that's exactly what believe the sign is trying to target in that ironic that it's called believe the sign we believe the sign and then we go we go stumble across that website and it says believe the sign and we think well they believe the sign but what they're hypocrites they don't even represent the very thing that their their domain name says about them they say they believe the sign but they don't believe nothing they become a faithless and a perverse generation given over to their carnal lust and their carnal desires they don't even know what they stand for their stan they know what they stand against but they don't know they don't know nothing he said now she is a woman if she is married to christ the word she cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time for she's bound by it for she cannot live with both husbands at the same time one's got to be dead to have the other and if she tries to mix them she shall be called an adulteress if you mix it up you're an adulteress what adulteress can enter heaven and brother brown said what adulteress can enter heaven would god marry an adulteress would god marry an adulteress somebody that's this that doesn't want to believe all his word somebody that well i don't know if i can trust you i don't know about that you say the word is what's going to change me i don't know about that i i i i'd rather have a good feeling than sit and listen to the word clean me out and the word sanctify me i'd i'd rather just have a good feeling than to go home and and and roll around in the muck and the wire of the word marriage is the oldest institution in the world brotherhood said marriage was performed first and instituted in the garden of eden right and marriage requires certain things y'all doing all right i i feel like he said a woman is entrusted with sir i know i know this is a little bit we're waiting on deep water for a wednesday night uh or tuesday night but it's all right a woman he said a woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile and you know he lines them out he outlines them all she got to have character she's got to be a subjection to her husband i'm gonna just kind of skim through these requirements she's got to have character that she protects she protects her character what what kind of we're talking about we're talking about character the statue of a perfect man is character so when you come to be married you got to have character and not our own character but his character and you got to have what matters is your children what kind of children is a godly woman we're going to raise what kind of a child is this kind of woman going to raise children that's born out there in the denomination of quagmire are children that come forth screaming and shouting born of a new birth born by the word that's the kind of a children that the bride of christ produces children that are born real born again children that's the kind of children that she produces and a woman that's in subjection to her husband trusted him and believing in him he said a woman a woman's got to protect that virtue because she's a betting ground for life and that's why you've got to protect your christian ver i'm talking about spiritually now spiritually you don't go listening to every every every every kind of strange doctrine because you're protecting that betting ground the bettinger the word the seeds got to come through the body and that's how life comes forth that's why a preacher that's not preaching the truth how can life come forth but when the but when the word of god when that character is protected that virtue is protected you haven't been listening to a bunch of nonsense and tomfoolery then life can come forth life will come forth through the body believers the character of a woman the character of a christian woman the strength of this christian woman somebody that will be in subjection to her to her to her husband and bring forth children bring forth real children he said in the spoken word as the original seed the seed of christ must come through his body not through the nomination but through a born-again seed of the word must come through how does my seed come through through my body how does the apple tree seed come through through the body seed is through the body and the church is the body of christ which is why it's got to be protected it matters what you believe and when that woman that bride comes before comes before the minister to be married she's got before if she's all that stuff in her life all that past that she's done she's got to confess any wrong she's got to confess otherwise you can't be joined in matrimony you can't be joined together she's got a sacred trust of virtue committed to her by her lord a certain virtue the same as the church that was married to the law has to come also before christ before the second marriage she's got to confess that how are we going to be married to christ if we don't confess all of the things that we believed that was wrong all of the things i i i think that should throw us all to to to desire to repent desire to make things right because it's got to be confessed he said that's committed to her sacred virtue sacred womanhood and then sacred motherhood honor her husband husband she's been given this sacred trust that she must not break of womanhood have her character her character raise her children her children's got to be born right and raised up right that's the kind of bride that christ is going to have the bride that's going to preach the gospel children are going to be born right raised up right ephesians 4 11 and 12 fulfilled that in that body five full ministry is going to be preaching the word so that the children are raised upright be honorable to her husband and how are you honorable to your husband you don't you don't go standing up there at that altar in front of in front of the minister uh a woman think about a woman thinking about one the the best man or or you know thinking about somebody in the congregation or something like casting their eyes hither and yawn you see brother brandon said look look at what hollywood has done it's turned the whole thing into just a big adulterous mess where where girls don't even know how to act right because their their parents have got the hollywood on the tv with all that kissing and slopping and all that stuff going around and and what does that produce it produces an adulterous generation where there's no there's no confidence between one another there's he said the church is just as bad right committing adultery with everything and she's no business to be going into she should stay with the word because you've got a sacred trust a sacred trust to your husband what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she's the type of the church how you how you know how can you identify the bride he said look at her love her watch her love her watch what she's in love with watch what kind of children she's bearing watch whether her children are wanting to stay away from the world and and live right and do right and actually be born right born by the word what kind of a children what kind of children is she born at bearing is she bearing children like galatians 4 6 that says you come forth crying out by father crying after your father crying knowing your father and crying after him we we need to have a wedding ceremony we need to be married to christ but you got to separate yourself by death from your first denominational husband you must be dead to your first husband now you go you go back and listen to that sermon and find out how many times brother brown repeats that over and over it almost sounds like a broken record you got to be dead you got to be dead to your first tusman what does dead mean jesus you know jesus actually let lazarus die he didn't go back so that he could die why did he let him die so that his resurrection power could be made manifest in his life he let him die and that's what we've got to do we've got to die to our first husband we've got to die to everything that we used to be he said if you're united to christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulteress you are laodicea we're following jesus christ the word to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of god and as long as you hold a man's tradition of denominations you are called and god's word and adulterous as long as you're a denominational creed seeker belonging to a denominational church that denies the word you are an adulteress what the bible says why would that make you an adulteress because you're not staying with what the bible said the bible said you need to be baptized in the name of jesus in acts 2 38. the bible said that there will be malacca in malachi 4 5 6 that god would send somebody to turn our hearts back in this last day he said you can't be a virtuous bible believing christian and so you associate yourself and the denominational affair you just can't do it at the same time one has got to be dead and let the other one live how could a preacher look at acts 2 38 and see that there's not a person in the bible ever baptizing those titles and then still say he's pregnant with the word of god telling you a lie he sold his birthright he's committed adultery against the very thing that he said he's put away in divorce god is going to have a virtuous church just exactly a bride now that's if that's an adulterous church what would it be to be preaching the truth saying exactly what brother branham said a a a preacher a ministry that will preach exactly what brother brahma said god is going to have a virtuous bride you look at how you go back and read this message and brother brown he brings it down holds it down so so narrow he says in one place there's going to be very very very very few saved very few that will actually go all the way so it's examining time time to examine yourself he said now take a look at a good look for a moment with your own spiritual insight at your soul look at yourself for a few minutes you say that message you're preaching brother branham is wrong look at yourself a little bit let the holy spirit search your minds with the word you'll agree with the message if you'll just listen to the holy spirit you'll agree with the message let christ the anointed word search out your own conscience let him get in let him get into you see if that's right or not amen you can't preach luther's message today you can't preach wesley's message you can't peace to preach the pentecostal message there's a message today that's being preached that is the true unadulterated word of god that will unite the bride and christ together it proves that we're the end times i'm skipping again i'm i'm trying to trying to find a place to close look in this that in this hour and i'll close in just a minute here the bride the bride knows where she stands now now you know in a marriage ceremony there's all these things that go into it there's there's there's the the marriage certificate there's the token that has to be given there's the the minister doing his part there's all through the bible the the minister was the one that introduced the bride to the groom the eliezer introducing uh rebecca to isaac and and you've got all these parts that are played and so you know when all these parts come together it builds up your confidence and your faith that something is actually taking place in your life and you can look at that evidence that there's a union taking place like for example after the marriage ceremony you can you can wave that marriage certificate around you take it you look at it it's got it's got the signature of the signat of the efficient it's got your signature it's got the bride signature everybody's signed it it's got the stamp it's got the seal and you can take that and you can look at it and say yup we're married and you can see with confidence that you're married and you see you can't get that marriage certificate though until all the requirements have been met that minister standing up there ain't going to marry nobody if you've still got a living husband he's not going to go through all that but when you get that marriage certificate that proves that the old man is dead now see and the marriage certificate is the book and so that's why the bible in the revelation it talks about the open the book is opened up so you open up that book and you can see that it's the proof that you've been married when you when the book is opened up and you look into it and now he said brother ram said now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life with the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate so the marriage certificate is the book that you look in the lamb's book of life it's opened up why did john take the book because he's taken his marriage certificate he's taken it and he ate it up and he know it's revealed to him it's not something that we can physically hold in our hand necessarily but we we we believe it and by faith we can see our name in the book we can see that we're actually just like you look at the marriage certificate there's my name there's the groom's name there's the stamp there's the seal it's all been sealed and you can look with confidence and recognize that the marriage has been completed you look in the book and that book brother adam in one place he said it's like your natural life grew up grew up until it came to a place where it could be joined with eternal life and that eternal life is your book and you're looking at eternal life and you recognize that you always were eternal not your natural life but that that eternal life that now you're connected to so you the book opens up and you look back to genesis 1 26 27 that says so god created a man in his own image and the image of god created him male and female created to them and there's your marriage certificate now now you see you grew up you grew up through your natural life and then you came to a place where you could be knighted with that and even then you grow and grow until you become one and then you can look you recognize that's why you got to be birthed into these you're you're you're even birthed into understanding of predestination when that final birth that i recognize that i always was eternal you're birthed into that now you can see where you come from and you recognize you recognize you're married you recognize that the marriage certificate has been opened up and you can see now now what does that marriage certificate say he said now he said it says where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold he said now you're not only forgiven but you're justified glory just you see what justification i mean you grew up that natural all growing up until you come you join together with that eternal life and then you can really say not that you're forgiven but you never did it to begin with you're justified yeah romans 5 1 said therefore being justified by faith look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven what is justified now this is this is not no little baby justification we're talking about where your sins are chopped off and this is not even a little maybe step above that but you it says though you never did it but the real you never did it and that kind of justification means the real you never disbelieved god's word the real you never struggled with the word the real you never told a lie the real you never stole you never spoke against your brother you never murdered you you never were jealous you never disbelieved the real you never did why because the real you always was going back to genesis 1 26 the real union and the old union that old man that's what paul was talking about in romans chapter 7 the old man is dead the old union is in the sea of god for god's forgetfulness you weren't married to it to begin with he bore your shame himself for you and your place he took your place for you we're predestinated for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world brother bob this is a little bit deep but i i think it's time for a wedding it's time for marriage now now listen he said how did you how did you come to this how did you how did you come how how did you get here before the minister with the bride and the bridegroom how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after eve who committed adultery that's the reason he was born an adulteress but but he redeemed you he took you from being an adulteress to being somebody that he was willing to be married to well you talk about grace that's why you're mrs grace because the grace of god has been given to you that he he took you from plucked you up from the ditch and and put you in the king's palace he said you was deceived into it you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world god put your name in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate you look at that marriage certificate and you recognize well here's what he said you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning he said this is my message to the church now you are standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every tittle where you're standing you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place talk about a thanksgiving talk about a thanksgiving that's something to be thankful for he said i'm more thankful for that than any i know of you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place he said you are perfect i i think that that that'll knock down all this idea like how can we be perfect how can we i've i've heard that so much it just might makes me want to vomit how can we perfect god gave us a way to be perfect god gave us the the recipe he gave us the the avenue he gave us the power to be perfect his power is his word why because he took my place he took my place and he made a way you see there's a marriage taking place there's an invisible union taking place where where christ and his bride are being united with the word how can she be united because all the requirements have been met that old man he said god let it die you know what that means god let it die it means it means when you know when abraham first started on his journey god told him to go this way and he started going in that direction and before long he looked back and all the idols and stuff he used to make it was gone it was dead what did that god let it die he let it die how he he took you on a journey you went on a journey and you began to put one foot in front of the other and god let it die it wasn't you that took away all that all that all that natural desire the things of the world it was it was god god's word claim in your life and as he claimed you and moved you from point a to point b god let it die [Applause] which means your first wedding that abraham down there in in the in the fertile crescent uh making all them idols that first wedding was a knoll he said you never done it in the first place there's only one thing to do it that would be god come down himself and took your place in the form of son of god jesus christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the water of the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how are you going to be washed you're still as spotted as eve was what made eve spotted she wouldn't stand and let the word cleaner she wouldn't believe she wouldn't put all be in complete subjection to the word but if you're in complete subjection of the word you're standing completely you never sinned in the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestined to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and is dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god why because the bride has met the requirements all the requirements have been met her old husband is dead she's clothed herself in the wedding garments she's made herself ready she is in subjection and she's got the marriage license as proof now what's the next thing in the marriage i don't don't get all hung up on the order here i know after the wedding then you sign the marriage license and everything but now when when at the end of the marriage ceremony the marriage ceremony the minister will say i require a token i got to have a token to show something's something's been done the man takes that token and he slips it on he slips that token on her on her hand to show that they're married so so she can show it's actually on display so that everybody can see it she can when she's going to buy groceries at the store she can show that token that she's married so if you're going to a wedding in the sky you're wearing the wedding band brother brown said of predestinated unmerited grace a wedding band of grace unmerited of your own amen god did it himself he give you the holy ghost he's to the true baptism of the holy ghost the token that you did you didn't do anything to get it all you did was be in subjection to him all you did was say i believe what you say in subjection and that in fact full obedience to the word of god entitles you to the token full of beingness what's full obedience the bible says you need to be born again and you were born again the bible says you need to climb the statue of perfect man and you did it the bible says you need to believe god's word and you did it that's obedience obedience is subjection not doing something that you work up with your own self but you god did it himself he knew before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on the book the musicians can come forward i'm going to close on that what a thanksgiving he said hallelujah praise our god amen amen when you fully obey the word in full surrender to her you're entitled to the token what grace that god has given to us in this hour isn't he wonderful to be separated from all all the old of the old man denomination all the fields and things of this world and all those things that kept you in man-made creeds and to be joined to christ that's something to be thankful for tonight let's stand to our feet and just and worship the lord you love him tonight saints [Music] there's a

you're released you're free that's that's another sermon yes preach on binding and loosing because you know what you know what our sins bound our husband to calvary he had to go but he went for me and you because he was bound to it right he was bound to die so that me and you don't have to so he could kill your old husband amen so give that brother a good hand again good job good job i may steal

sister monica hmm esther has a testimony well she has a microphone i didn't see her raise her hand but that's okay come on no just come on you come over here you can stand there what you want to do come around here come on um this is just gonna be really quick but he is right about all the traffic and all the people going fast for thanksgiving and stuff um just so y'all know i'm not a bad driver or anything some i disagree but i was at a stop sign on my way to work this morning and i was gonna turn left i looked both ways there were no cars i looked both ways like five times okay no cars i did not see a single car so i was like okay coast is clear i'm just gonna go so um as i was going uh there was some in my head that said stop and it was so sudden i just like slammed on my brakes and it was in the middle i was in the middle of this first lane before you go in the second lane and there was a car that came out of nowhere and i didn't see it at all it just came out of nowhere and if i wouldn't have heard that voice i would have hit it or it would have hit me and it was going like really fast i probably would have died or been ended up in the hospital so i just thank god that he was watching over me sometimes we don't know where them cars come from they just come out of nowhere how many of that happened to all of us where you have a time though where you pull up to a place though and and something says don't go right now that's right stop had it happen several several times and then all of a sudden you see that car go by that you didn't see when you look five times you're right you know so it's the grace of god it's like brother bob said this thing all this is built on grace by the grace of god we get up in the morning by the grace of god we live by the grace of god we have our being is what the bible says then we're going to end this thing up with grace statue your perfect man you have something sis alicia okay okay you were just praising the lord okay jim we do need to know that's correct that's right so for those of you that didn't hear this on the internet maybe on december the 12th we're only going to have one service then sister waiving is going to get married at two o'clock here at the church so we'll have to get all of everything ready for that and then at six o'clock there'll be a reception all right in gainesville that's being put on by some of her friends so like i said you don't have to bring anything but if you want to go eat she needs to know so there'll be a sign up sheet downstairs we'll have the wedding at two it'll be over whatever time three o'clock or so and then we go to gainesville at six o'clock and there'll be a reception and she's invited everybody to come that wants to come but she needs to know an amount of people that will come from here from the church everybody got that so let just if you just sign your name up said yes we will be there if you're not going to come just don't put your name down okay so let's bow our heads dear lord jesus thank you for this day that you give us truly as brother bob was reading directly from those quotes from the invisible union that was preached on thanksgiving day 11 25 1965. just a month before you took the prophet off the scene he preached an invisible union what a message what a wonderful time lord to have a thanksgiving when the pilgrims came across here lord to a new world as brother bob said there was a new word it was a new world but there was a new word that come forth they came out of and went into the united states into a new land lord i pray that we get out of this old land that we're in and get into a new land lord the message of the hour becomes more personal to each one of us lord that new land they they cherish the land that they were on out uh they had a thanksgiving day with the indians and all the different people they were giving thanks that they had made it alive to this new world well father we're going to a new world but lord you give us a piece of it now that we can understand and enjoy a thanksgiving every day of our life but lord i pray that you'd be with each one that's on the highways lord coming up these next few days that a lot of people be traveling the devil would love to interrupt our lives and i pray in the name of the lord jesus that the guardian angels will be with each one of us and it'll bring them back safely home lord and they'll have a good time or a thanksgiving lord just bless each one be with our pastor keep him strong lord continue to heal his body be with the ones lord that are not with us tonight lord that are sick just lord you're the healer that's all we know you're the healer you're the great physician you're the one that will dissolve the prophet said all of our doubts so i pray lord that you'll do that so that we'll be bound to you father bless us and be with us until we come back together lord sunday in your name the name of the lord jesus christ amen you're dismissed god bless you [Music] are you ready
