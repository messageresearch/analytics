[0:12] back for more so praise the
[0:15] Lord by the grace of the lord we were
[0:18] going to talk about financial Jubilee
[0:20] and talking about
[0:23] conform and um you know certainly as
[0:27] we've been talking about financial
[0:28] Jubilee you know I I trust by God's
[0:31] grace that you you're making progress
[0:33] you know in your life wherever you are
[0:35] whatever season whatever point you are
[0:37] in your life and um you know often I I I
[0:40] want to talk about practical things
[0:43] things literal things you could do but
[0:45] it's very important we understand why
[0:47] you know because you could be motivated
[0:48] you could be charged up and I'm I got it
[0:52] but if you don't know why it's going to
[0:55] eventually evaporate so it's very
[0:58] important to know why why why is this
[1:00] important why is this important even the
[1:02] word of God that we've been hearing for
[1:03] so many years you why why and um
[1:07] hopefully by the grace of the lord we
[1:08] can throw some practical things in here
[1:09] as well but let's just go to the Lord in
[1:11] prayer Lord Jesus we thank you this
[1:14] morning Lord once again to together in
[1:16] your name father with your people Lord
[1:17] Jesus we don't take it for granted and
[1:19] we pray Lord God that you just bless
[1:21] this little Sunday school teaching Lord
[1:23] God may it go to the Heart Lord God may
[1:25] it produce results Lord Jesus oh God in
[1:28] all of our Lives Lord Jesus Lord God may
[1:30] we be able to see it Lord Jesus as a
[1:32] just a map Lord God to help us with the
[1:35] the more precious promises Lord that you
[1:37] have for all of us father we commit this
[1:39] day into your hands bless the entire
[1:40] service Lord Jesus we commit it in your
[1:42] hands in Jesus Christ's name amen praise
[1:45] the lord we go to the next
[1:47] slide so always remember no matter how
[1:50] long they had been in bondage or how
[1:52] long they were supposed to stay there
[1:54] when the Year of Jubilee when the year
[1:56] come of Jubilee when the trumpet sounded
[1:58] every man could go free if he wanted to
[2:01] go free so you can see right there if if
[2:05] it depends on what we want to do if we
[2:08] want to go free if we want these
[2:10] promises then we can we just need to
[2:13] understand we need to understand and we
[2:14] need to have that fight that we talked
[2:16] about we got to have that strength to
[2:17] keep fighting to keep pressing every day
[2:20] it doesn't stop no matter what season of
[2:23] life we're in you continue fighting and
[2:25] learning what God wants us to learn then
[2:28] we can be a good example to those under
[2:30] us that's coming up so continue to fight
[2:33] next slide so when we talk about conform
[2:35] conform it means with the word con means
[2:39] with together mean basically to adopt
[2:41] the form of those around us to be
[2:44] similar or identical to be in agreement
[2:47] or Harmony to be obedient or compliant
[2:51] usually used with to conform to
[2:54] another's wishes to act in accordance
[2:57] with prevailing standards or customs
[3:00] basically it means you go with the flow
[3:03] that's the easy way to say it I'm going
[3:04] with the flow and that's exactly what
[3:07] water does water goes wherever is the
[3:09] easiest path it flows right in it'll fit
[3:13] whatever container whatever mold you
[3:15] decide to put it in it will
[3:18] fit and certainly you know coming up
[3:20] with financial Jubilee with me I mean
[3:21] that's what I did I mean although I was
[3:23] born again God changed my life in 1999 I
[3:27] was born again but with finances I
[3:30] didn't know I just didn't know I wasn't
[3:33] taught I I didn't understand it so I was
[3:36] just going with the flow of the world
[3:38] and I was learning so many things that
[3:40] the world has a lot to teach you now
[3:42] believe me it'll teach you all kind of
[3:44] tricks to the trade and my goodness I
[3:47] thought I was just going with it but
[3:50] truly what I was used to I was just used
[3:52] to the form used to the normal flow of
[3:54] the world what they did you know if they
[3:56] happen to have a little money what did
[3:58] they do they spend everything that comes
[3:59] in and so I was doing the same thing I
[4:02] was used to thinking that way I was used
[4:04] to applying my life that way you know
[4:06] just like if you think about a slave and
[4:08] that's typically what the world wants us
[4:10] to be with finances to be just slaves to
[4:12] the world just flow with it don't
[4:14] challenge it don't question it hey if
[4:16] you can get a house with a mortgage
[4:18] praise God thank God you got that loan
[4:21] that's what you Lord I got approved
[4:22] praise the Lord don't matter what the
[4:24] interest rate is you know that's that's
[4:26] thinking like the world that's what it
[4:29] does I can pay all my bills well have
[4:31] you looked at your bills have you
[4:33] questioned them have you said Lord God
[4:35] is this what you want me to be doing so
[4:37] thinking and challenging that getting
[4:39] out of just the form but I was used to
[4:41] that thinking like a slave of course
[4:44] until as brother Louis brought out until
[4:47] God set me up amen he set me up and this
[4:50] is why I'm here today because he set me
[4:52] up and I was just going we were happy oh
[4:56] praise God going with it and then God
[4:59] told me me know let's go to the next
[5:01] Slide the word of God as we talked about
[5:04] conform you can't help but see this
[5:05] scripture and it says and be not
[5:07] conformed to this world but be ye
[5:10] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[5:14] that you may prove what is that good and
[5:17] acceptable and perfect will of God so we
[5:21] know conform means just to go with the
[5:22] flow but there is an intense pressure in
[5:26] this day to conform period doesn't
[5:28] matter what age you are it doesn't
[5:30] matter who you are doesn't matter if
[5:31] you're born again there is a pressure to
[5:34] conform it's so strong you have people
[5:36] with intelligent minds they will call
[5:39] black white white black a girl a boy a
[5:42] boy a girl anything that's the pressure
[5:45] such an intense
[5:47] pressure and and and that's what we will
[5:49] we will just go with the flow but God is
[5:52] saying we have to be transformed in
[5:54] order to get these principles in order
[5:57] for us to get up that statue of a
[5:58] perfect man we have to to be transformed
[6:00] in our minds that mean we have to be
[6:02] changed a different form that picture on
[6:05] the previous slide you saw water there
[6:07] was Water Ice and there was steam so we
[6:10] have to be changed completely in how
[6:13] we're thinking about our finances
[6:15] thinking oh Lord this is just a little
[6:18] map of the greater promises that you
[6:20] have Lord this is where it's a part that
[6:23] I have to do and it's a part that you do
[6:26] Lord you provide my needs but you're
[6:28] asking me to be a steward of this Lord
[6:31] God you have given me these precious
[6:33] promises but it's me I have to be
[6:35] diligent I have to pray and read my
[6:37] Bible every day I have to continue doing
[6:40] that there's a part that you have to
[6:42] play and as we pay play that part then
[6:44] you see God start to move you start
[6:47] understanding oh Lord this is what
[6:48] you're doing and the Devil he's so
[6:51] tricky that's why I have that yes and
[6:53] no because the devil he is like a yes
[6:58] yes seems good and God is like
[7:04] no and that's a shock it's a shock to
[7:07] your system that God will say
[7:11] no no you can't have it no you're not
[7:15] ready for it no you don't need
[7:19] it and the Devil comes along and says
[7:22] well yes you can
[7:25] sure I have a way for you and he's been
[7:29] doing that from the very beginning
[7:31] something as simple as just to know the
[7:33] Garden of Eden there you go God said no
[7:36] you can't eat of that tree the devil
[7:39] says well you can you can do it you
[7:42] actually
[7:44] can there you go then Cain and
[7:47] Abel you know Cain says hey this is what
[7:50] I want this is what I want to
[7:52] offer Satan says if can you do it the
[7:55] best you can God said no no I'm not
[7:56] accepting that that that's a rejection
[7:59] it's like Brother Lou brought I just
[8:01] like no why is he saying no and it's the
[8:04] same thing today you could directly
[8:06] apply that to finances if you don't have
[8:08] the money if you don't have the money
[8:10] and you feel in urged to borrow that is
[8:12] God's way of saying no you're not ready
[8:16] you're not ready for it why don't you
[8:17] have the money CU I'm just telling you
[8:19] no you're not ready but the devil's
[8:21] going to come along and says yes you can
[8:24] there's many ways you can do it many
[8:26] ways you can do it you see and we go
[8:30] down that path it's easy and then we
[8:32] start conforming thank the Lord for this
[8:34] loan and you hear brother say that you
[8:37] hear sisters say that you're like well
[8:38] I'm going go apply for my loan thank the
[8:39] Lord the Lord is good we conforming in
[8:42] the church everybody's just getting
[8:43] their loans we just happy celebrating
[8:45] with our loans conforming just going
[8:48] with it not even thinking about it and
[8:51] that's exactly what was happening in my
[8:52] life just going with the flow just not
[8:54] even thinking about it the devil saying
[8:56] yes you can yes you got it
[8:59] Oh my he is something and he's always
[9:03] applied that and no gets really deep no
[9:06] gets really deep I was talking with my
[9:08] wife just driving in you know it gets so
[9:11] deep that it can break your faith if
[9:14] you're not
[9:15] careful you know we have expectations of
[9:18] what we think things should happen
[9:20] things should be this way things should
[9:22] go according to my plan my I remember
[9:25] raising kids and before we had kids and
[9:28] we would see the other couples with
[9:29] their little kids and we're like soon as
[9:30] we get our kids our kids going to listen
[9:32] they going to sit still we got this I'm
[9:36] telling you how can they let their kids
[9:38] keep slamming the door we're like what
[9:39] in the world our kids going and I would
[9:42] hold somebody else kid like see I held
[9:44] him quiet for 3 minutes I got this I'm
[9:47] telling you when my kids come along my
[9:51] goodness and I you know I man I thought
[9:53] I was good even when they became
[9:55] teenagers I'm like I got we I know if I
[9:57] just talk right they're gonna get it the
[10:01] Lord like uhuh no I'mma keep you on your
[10:05] knees period you know and that's what he
[10:08] does we have expectations who might be
[10:10] your friend who might not be friendly
[10:13] even when we pray we have expectations
[10:15] like Lord You're Going to heal them
[10:17] you're going to do it God says no no no
[10:19] no no no no no not this time why because
[10:23] he has a plan he has a greater plan he's
[10:25] writing a story he's writing a strip as
[10:28] our brother brought out he's writing a
[10:30] play so he has to say no to his children
[10:33] so we can go along and fit his plan
[10:36] right so he says no and all we have to
[10:39] do is realize just as our brother
[10:41] brought out like Lord you just have
[10:43] something greater for me help me to keep
[10:46] that Faith Lord and in every area he's
[10:50] trying to do that but finances is just a
[10:52] area that he's given us that we can
[10:54] start looking at it he says no to
[10:57] something because you don't have the
[10:58] money that doesn't mean go away
[11:00] disappointed said Lord all right Lord
[11:03] then you must have something better you
[11:04] must have a better plan Lord help me to
[11:07] stay there and keep walking and you'll
[11:08] see what he
[11:10] does but the devil has done so much to
[11:13] just get us locked in and as we talk
[11:15] about Conformity of course you got the
[11:17] internet it's just loaded with
[11:20] conforming and pressuring us to conform
[11:23] I was reading something about the
[11:24] internet it said you know what happens
[11:27] we get an idea in our minds and all of
[11:29] the social media comes in right and it
[11:32] entrenches you into your very idea it
[11:35] locks you into your idea so it's harder
[11:38] for you to come out just like ice you
[11:41] fit it in and then you freeze it and
[11:42] that's what he's trying to do freeze our
[11:44] thoughts you want this car he'll show
[11:46] you all kind of images of it bo bo Boop
[11:48] popping up you search once now you got
[11:50] it every moment here's the same car you
[11:52] know you want it hey next thing you know
[11:54] you're get an advertisement for a loan
[11:55] everything just oh my God he's just
[11:57] pouring it and he's always done this but
[11:59] now he's just doing it in Greater
[12:01] intensity greater intensity because he
[12:04] wants to entrench us lock us into a
[12:06] certain
[12:07] form go to the next slide as I said you
[12:11] know this was me this was was a standard
[12:14] and I I we set out by God's grace I
[12:16] shared a little bit of the testimony
[12:17] last last time how you know we were
[12:20] going to nor normal going with the flow
[12:22] and um my goodness you know all the
[12:24] money came in I started saying how much
[12:26] house can I get to the max
[12:29] and uh we got that 40-year loan and uh
[12:32] should have been in bondage just
[12:34] thinking about my brother we the the
[12:36] road that we lived on was called bond
[12:37] avenue that should have told me
[12:41] something bond avenue yes we were locked
[12:45] in for 40 years it was supposed to be
[12:48] that's why Jubilee doesn't matter how
[12:50] long you're supposed to be I was
[12:52] supposed to be in bondage for 40 years
[12:56] but God set me up that business we were
[12:58] were doing great the first house we sold
[13:00] my brother and I you know we were just
[13:02] smart we got $1,000 about $10,000 profit
[13:06] oh man we were like yes praise God I was
[13:09] really imagining Lord you the next one
[13:12] you're going to bless me I'm going to be
[13:13] able to pay cash for a car cuz you're
[13:15] going to bless me while we were
[13:17] borrowing money we had access to borrow
[13:19] a whole bunch of money for these
[13:20] properties and man I was thought Lord
[13:22] this is how you going to work it out
[13:23] Lord you're so wonderful lord said nope
[13:26] no no matter of fact I'm going to say
[13:28] the entire economy in real estate Just
[13:30] For You John my goodness we started
[13:34] seeing that economy go down my goodness
[13:36] money going out the door my my my but we
[13:40] turned around and said Lord you must
[13:42] have something better because Lord I
[13:44] have paid my tithes I have not tried to
[13:46] do anything wrong and I started seeking
[13:48] God and as I sought God we started
[13:51] focusing all we lost ton of money paid
[13:54] it off but as I started learning the
[13:57] principles of God I started questioning
[14:00] what I had done Lord this house I
[14:03] question it I paid off all that business
[14:07] debt accepted that challenge paid it off
[14:10] and I started looking at our house and
[14:11] challenging myself like Lord something
[14:13] something's wrong and this is when I
[14:15] started looking at okay man I borrowed
[14:17] two loans for the house we owed about
[14:20] 300 something thousand but if I just
[14:21] paid that 40 years it's going to cost me
[14:24] $800,000 I did not sign up for that so
[14:27] we challenged that we started taking
[14:29] God's principles and applying them as we
[14:32] read it in the Bible I mean and we would
[14:34] be up I would just be looking at I start
[14:35] talking to my wife about it like I I
[14:38] didn't know these things I didn't know
[14:40] these things I I didn't know but Lord
[14:44] God since I had paid off that business
[14:46] loan I started seeing Lord if I just
[14:48] took what you taught me there and I just
[14:51] applied it directly to my house now now
[14:54] when I'm saying apply it that means
[14:56] there's sacrifices there's things that
[14:57] are happening I'm not going with the
[14:59] flow anymore it's hard we every Sunday
[15:02] we be out to eat every I mean that this
[15:05] was us you know we would just buy
[15:07] whatever we want to we didn't think
[15:08] about it you said but now I started
[15:11] pausing like hold on wait a second
[15:13] what's going on and I took the
[15:15] principles of God so we're going to
[15:16] bring out the principles once again
[15:18] let's go to the next slide so I started
[15:21] learning all right God owns it all the
[15:24] 10% tides are his and the 90% okay
[15:27] that's another no if if you're not
[15:28] hearing it that means a 90% is not yours
[15:30] to say yes to everything it's no it
[15:33] don't belong to you just like your
[15:35] tithes you need to ask God lord what
[15:37] would you have me to do with this father
[15:39] what do you want me to do with it don't
[15:41] go with the world the world will say hey
[15:42] you got 90% especially the younger
[15:43] people leverage that do this do that do
[15:45] this now you better ask God lord what
[15:47] would you have me to do with it manage
[15:50] his resources diligent you have to be
[15:52] diligent you can't just go like water
[15:54] flow with it God has given you money for
[15:57] a reason right a reason you have a job
[16:01] you have assets you have this for a
[16:04] reason you have to manage his
[16:07] resources and it doesn't have to be deep
[16:10] you can take anything to start managing
[16:11] his resources start somewhere write it
[16:14] down on a napkin a piece of paper what
[16:17] am I spending every month today is the
[16:19] end of the month right at it you got a
[16:21] whole month of May write down what you
[16:22] think your expenses are what do you
[16:25] think you're going to spend you know you
[16:27] got rent or bills you electric gas you
[16:30] know how much do you think you spend on
[16:31] food write that down that'll give you an
[16:33] idea okay Lord you given me $3,000 to to
[16:37] take care of my myself for this month I
[16:39] know I make
[16:41] 4,000 you know okay I do I got my ties
[16:44] and things like that Lord I I really if
[16:46] I do this month at the end of next month
[16:48] I should have
[16:51] $500 that means I got my food I got this
[16:54] I should have $500 left at the end of
[16:56] next month and see what happens
[16:59] now if you write it down and you're like
[17:02] Lord look like I'm going to be short
[17:06] 2,000 then you might want to pause and
[17:08] say Lord okay let let me really think
[17:09] about what's going to happen next month
[17:11] can I cut out something doesn't have to
[17:13] be fancy you're just asking God to help
[17:16] you and he will continue to build on it
[17:19] that's what he's doing he's building on
[17:20] the promises that we have step by step
[17:23] so take that be
[17:25] diligent remember money is still your
[17:28] time you're working if you throw that
[17:29] hour away D it's like you're taking your
[17:31] life for granted you're taking it for
[17:34] granted so it should be worth something
[17:36] to
[17:38] you remember patience we got to learn to
[17:41] wait that is so important learn to wait
[17:43] God just has something better he doesn't
[17:45] want you to rush out just because you
[17:48] have it don't mean you rush out to it
[17:50] some of those older ones you're retired
[17:52] you got money you may have more assets
[17:54] through life that means you may have to
[17:56] wait on for your grandchild a little bit
[17:58] longer you know I'm not going to do it
[17:59] right away let me see how this little
[18:01] girl is acting or how this little boy is
[18:03] acting you know is he acting good
[18:07] remember those parents are raising those
[18:09] grandchildren you know they know you
[18:12] know that child may be walking around
[18:13] like I get whatever I want granddad's
[18:15] going to get it for me you know you
[18:17] might need to put a little plug Granddad
[18:19] just give it a little time you know we
[18:21] know it's a season you get to enjoy
[18:24] remember they're in a season as well and
[18:25] they're in a terrible season with ton of
[18:28] influence and they do live in a society
[18:30] where they think it's all yes all yes
[18:33] you tell them no they'll say hey there's
[18:35] a way that's just for you daddy that's
[18:37] just for you Mom but there is a yes for
[18:39] me and so we have to make sure we're
[18:42] laid we're showing them how to wait
[18:43] because God is going to ask us to wait
[18:46] and God is going to say no why because
[18:49] it's not our plan it's not my plan he
[18:51] has a plan so he's going to say no to
[18:54] them and we don't want his no to cause
[18:56] them to walk away from the faith that's
[18:58] right amen so that's so important that
[19:01] we help them to understand like no and
[19:03] hold to those no I know it's hard I got
[19:05] kids you know we've been blessed you
[19:08] know we've been really blessed I know it
[19:09] by the grace of the Lord you know but I
[19:12] know God we got to help him we can say
[19:15] yes to every single thing that they want
[19:17] and whatever they want we saying yes yes
[19:19] yes no it's like Lord they got to hear
[19:21] from you if they think that then they're
[19:23] going to feel entitled and the minute
[19:25] God says no to them they're going to say
[19:26] well see the devil got me he has me he
[19:29] going to take care of me and they're
[19:30] going to go that
[19:32] route next Slide the blessings of the
[19:35] Lord it maketh the rich and he had is no
[19:37] sorrow to it that is nothing but the
[19:39] truth avoid debt avoid it God wants to
[19:43] bless us he wants to do it but we got to
[19:45] do it in his time and we got to learn to
[19:47] wait he is a good father believe me he
[19:50] will hold to his no he really will and
[19:53] he'll let you pay the price if you
[19:54] decide to do it that's a good father for
[19:57] you save for the winter remember it's
[20:00] coming save don't spend everything you
[20:02] got that's God saying just because you
[20:04] got it don't mean you give it all out
[20:06] today save a little bit of that look at
[20:09] the ant he's saying no you can't spend
[20:12] it all the best investment is giving
[20:14] giving that's some of that he wants you
[20:16] to give we know our tithes but it's also
[20:18] more than that it's giving and of course
[20:20] it's learning contentment that means you
[20:23] start learning how to say no yourself to
[20:26] yourself you start learning how to say
[20:28] no like Lord I'm going to say no next
[20:32] Slide by the grace of the Lord as I said
[20:35] when we paid off that debt and this is
[20:38] just to me I I believe this with no
[20:40] doubt after we paid that debt it was
[20:43] 2016
[20:45] 2015 that's when I you know I got some
[20:47] money I got a little bonus on the job
[20:49] after we paid off that debt and I didn't
[20:51] just buy what I wanted I knew we had
[20:53] that debt so I took that money I threw
[20:54] it on our mortgage and I started getting
[20:56] little chunks out of it like okay thank
[20:59] God and a little bit after that contined
[21:02] did that in 205 2015 paid a little bit
[21:05] more things started happening at the job
[21:07] they say okay we're going to let you
[21:08] start traveling
[21:09] internationally went overseas on my
[21:12] birthday 2016 lot more of the house was
[21:15] going I was feeling the momentum they
[21:16] said hey we're closing down to Maryland
[21:20] 2017 when we paid off that house it was
[21:22] 5 months later this is the truck that
[21:24] pulled up with the eagle on the side
[21:26] that packed us from Maryland to Georgia
[21:28] we were debt free by the grace of the
[21:33] Lord so had I waited for 40 years would
[21:36] I be coming down here in
[21:39] 47247 so praise God he has a plan for
[21:42] all of this but he by his grace on those
[21:45] e Eagle wings I like to say brought us
[21:48] down here after we were debt free praise
[21:51] the Lord Jesus next
[21:53] slide that's why I think our Prophet
[21:55] says it so much and I hope as you're
[21:57] hearing debt we talk about debt but it's
[21:59] really about cleaning up your lives it's
[22:01] cleaning your lives up it's handling
[22:03] your life like Joseph just being
[22:06] organized diligent about what's
[22:08] happening in your life and our Prophet
[22:10] says clean your lives up pay your debts
[22:13] oh no man Jesus said get all things off
[22:15] your hand get everything right Make
[22:17] Ready Get Ready remember in the name of
[22:20] the Lord something is fixing to happen
[22:24] my my my that is the word of God spoken
[22:26] to us by that prophet in 19
[22:28] 1965 think about how long that has been
[22:32] for us to have these words so it's clean
[22:35] your lives up let's get everything right
[22:37] that's what God is saying get it right
[22:39] he's waiting on us he is waiting on us
[22:43] to get ready so by God's grace let's
[22:46] take these little practical things and
[22:47] apply them to our life right above that
[22:50] before he said this he said and what are
[22:54] we coming here for what are we doing are
[22:55] we coming here playing a game are we
[22:57] coming here here meeting as a lodge it's
[23:01] Christ it's it's Christ can't come until
[23:04] the church is perfectly right he's
[23:06] waiting on us that's verse 283 so you
[23:10] can see what it means clean up your
[23:12] lives right in there he's saying get it
[23:14] right get organized make ready we are
[23:18] God has gifted us with the talents to do
[23:20] all these things and we can do it by the
[23:22] grace of the Lord Jesus just start
[23:25] somewhere start somewhere he will add to
[23:27] to
[23:30] it next
[23:32] slide let's keep going to the next one
[23:36] so yes and no Prophet just said so many
[23:38] words he said don't you see where the
[23:39] commercial word had commercial world has
[23:41] your nose to the Grind wheel said don't

[23:50] people fall for such as that and if the
[23:53] American people fall for such as that
