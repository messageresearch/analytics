[0:00] our Lord open the eyes of man I want to
[0:08] see you I want to see you amen I want to
[0:36] see you high and shining in the light of
[0:49] your glory for hours to power and
[1:01] [Music]
[1:08] shining in a lot of power and a nanny
[1:47] they meant I want to see him don't you
[1:49] good to see about in the house the Lord
[1:51] if you like to turn in your scriptures
[1:53] turn to first Peter one that we're not
[1:58] going to get on to going up the pyramid
[2:02] in the statue of a perfect man yet but
[2:04] we're using part of the scripture
[2:05] alright but I encourage you ask if you
[2:10] will for the next a couple of services
[2:13] if you'll do your studying or your
[2:16] thoughts or your reading and do it to
[2:19] the basis of the stature of a perfect
[2:22] man you know if you listen to the tape
[2:26] read the book stay especially in the
[2:28] first part where he's talking about
[2:32] faith how faith and be born again you
[2:36] want to get into that now so I don't
[2:38] know where to be Sunday morning
[2:40] Wednesday but pretty quick okay remember
[2:43] now the fellowship meeting will be the
[2:44] third Saturday which is a what to 17th
[2:47] remember brother Ernie Villanueva will
[2:50] be with us ministering for the weekend
[2:53] so keep these in mind keep all of the
[2:55] people that are sick and all of the
[2:57] things and I sent a message and said she
[3:00] has strep and double ear infection and a
[3:04] sinus infection
[3:06] so she's got a full dose of it you just
[3:08] remember her in your prayers and didn't
[3:11] do it I wish you would remember my nice
[3:13] one Terrence was requesting about
[3:15] because it's kind of an odd thing he's
[3:18] five years difference between us I'm her
[3:20] uncle but I'm only five years older than
[3:23] she is she was the first one of the
[3:25] nieces and nephews but she is kind of
[3:29] the medicine is affecting her to where
[3:32] that she thinks she's somewheres else
[3:35] and she thinks he's here thinks she's
[3:37] there and and everything and it was kind
[3:40] of funny but I did ask her I could
[3:42] always kid with her a lot I said if you
[3:45] write all this down we'll we'll make a
[3:47] book out of this thing
[3:48] and I said now you tell them next time
[3:50] they give you some medicine because
[3:52] that's what's doing it said tell them to
[3:54] give you some it's in Technicolor where
[3:56] you dreams and weird things or be
[3:59] different you know this is something the
[4:01] kid would pray for because she thinks
[4:04] that they've trying to put her into a
[4:06] nursing home you know when I told her
[4:08] day after don't you worry about it
[4:09] yeah you know I'll keep up with it and
[4:11] everything don't you worry about it you
[4:14] know in other words I'll go tell her
[4:16] today they tell me they're gonna put her
[4:17] in a nursing home but until then you
[4:21] just prayed she'd be all right I thought
[4:23] she's 7d what would that be 72 and
[4:26] that's you know she's having a lot of
[4:28] trouble with the medication so remember
[4:30] that first Peter 1:18 through 23 father
[4:39] we thank you for this day in your grace
[4:41] thank you for your love thank you for
[4:44] understanding thank you for you and we
[4:47] pray that you would just bless us now as
[4:49] we try to minister your word and open
[4:52] the eyes that we may walk therein and
[4:55] father lead us forgive our sins bless
[4:58] those that are sick among us never enter
[5:00] their Lord in all this trouble and never
[5:03] Richards got a lot of it in the
[5:04] different ones Lord and remember the
[5:06] cornesfamily they're in the loss of the
[5:08] loved one just remember all of these
[5:10] things father and let your love be with
[5:12] us we love you we thank you in Jesus
[5:14] name
[5:15] they meant hmm president much as you
[5:23] know that you were not redeemed with
[5:25] corruptible things as silver and gold
[5:28] from your vain conversation received by
[5:31] tradition from your father's now so you
[5:34] were the reason I'm picking this is
[5:36] we're trying to come in now to the new
[5:38] birth getting in to the day of Pentecost
[5:41] and in Paulus telling them you know all
[5:45] that Old Testament is fine but it didn't
[5:49] produce now we have to come to something
[5:52] that is anchoring it and getting more
[5:54] sure than what that was see in the
[5:58] understanding all right so you wouldn't
[6:02] redeem with that see all right but with
[6:04] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[6:06] lamb without blemish and without spot
[6:08] who've early was foreordained before the
[6:10] foundation of the world but was manifest
[6:12] in these last times for you who by him
[6:16] do believe in God that raised him up
[6:19] from the dead and gave him give him
[6:22] glory in your faith and hope might be it
[6:25] that's your faith and hope might be in
[6:27] God seeing you have purified your souls
[6:30] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[6:33] unto unfeigned that means there's white
[6:35] height as you can get in other words
[6:37] your your experience in Christ love of
[6:41] the Brethren see that you love one
[6:43] another with a pure heart fervently
[6:45] being born again not of corruptible seed
[6:48] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[6:51] which liveth and abideth for ever you
[6:54] may be seated
[6:55] Lord that is blessing now we're going to
[6:59] be using this as a title for the next
[7:02] few messages of being born again alright
[7:07] now we're going to be using it coming up
[7:11] to the born-again experience because
[7:13] that's what you're doing and remember
[7:16] you you're your new birth starts when
[7:21] you believe alright so if you truly
[7:24] believe now and that new birth starts it
[7:27] doesn't mean it's in too real
[7:29] it doesn't mean it's fully grown or
[7:31] anything it just means it starts alright
[7:34] so from that time on if it continues
[7:37] then all the way through your whole
[7:39] experience you are being born again then
[7:44] we'll get into the pyramid and pick up C
[7:46] of the things that we need of being born
[7:50] again of that basis but let's hold it to
[7:53] this part too to give understanding now
[7:58] we've tried to express something I have
[8:02] to Yemen review just a tad bit that to
[8:07] make sure we follow where we were
[8:09] talking about from salvation to
[8:11] Redemption and all of the message on
[8:14] salvation we saw that God as brother
[8:18] hood a brother in red green but the
[8:21] Henry Green would quote I think it's a
[8:23] quote pretty close but anyhow he would
[8:27] quote that God started his church the
[8:29] way he wanted it he wanted he wants his
[8:32] church the way he started it so that's
[8:35] that's the truth of where it was and we
[8:38] saw that that God started his children
[8:41] on earth in the basis of Adam and Eve
[8:44] and God giving them according to
[8:46] blasphemous names giving them eternal
[8:49] life in their soul all right but their
[8:53] body in their spirit was not eternal and
[8:56] it was in in the time bracket of not
[9:00] counting days and all like that for a
[9:02] while but then it developed into the
[9:05] being days and times all right but that
[9:08] was his children and that was the way
[9:10] God wanted his children Adam especially
[9:14] we use Adam called we don't want to see
[9:15] we don't want to get Eve because there's
[9:18] too much thinking about her but remember
[9:21] she was a child of God now are you gonna
[9:26] say she wasn't are you gonna say that
[9:27] Adam was but he wasn't then you're in
[9:31] trouble because remember the same one
[9:34] that put life into Adam put life into
[9:37] Eve alright so then we have to go with
[9:42] that the heavy eternal life in their
[9:44] body and that was the way God intended
[9:46] for it to be he meant for all of us to
[9:49] come that away without sin without any
[9:53] problems or insight that we would have
[9:55] come into being all right our body our
[9:59] soul would have been eternal with our
[10:01] body and our spirit would not been
[10:03] eternal and then we could go because it
[10:05] was already dire in the garden the tree
[10:08] of life was there for mankind to go eat
[10:11] of that tree and it would have produced
[10:14] the glorification or whatever you want
[10:17] to call it into our bodies you know but
[10:19] we know we didn't come that away but
[10:21] that's the way God wanted it that was
[10:23] his example now we're going to read a
[10:25] quote if we get over far enough in the
[10:27] message where brother Adam says to be
[10:29] born of the word in spirit is to take
[10:32] you back like you should have been in
[10:36] the beginning no to be born to the word
[10:41] espírita to take you back to that so
[10:43] that's a promise if he started his
[10:46] church our people you know we want to
[10:49] call it children more than saying church
[10:51] because we don't want to use church back
[10:53] dark so we he started his family with
[10:57] eternal life in their soul a body and a
[11:01] spirit that needed it and the sin came
[11:04] it came through the point of Eve and her
[11:07] memory reason causes sometimes that
[11:10] Satan could penetrate and bring it to
[11:13] the wrong place alright so we've had to
[11:15] battle ever since we covered that in a
[11:18] lot of messages trying to get down to a
[11:21] point to word that we could talk about
[11:23] the new birth all right now see then
[11:27] that's what God wants okay the new birth
[11:33] brings eternal life to you in your soul
[11:40] all right what's your body and spirit is
[11:43] still of the world right but your soul
[11:47] is eternal
[11:48] now what did Adam fall from he never
[11:52] fell from eternal life as we try to make
[11:54] it
[11:56] if he did he died and went to hell so
[11:57] you'd be in bad shape he fell from the
[12:01] point that he never brought forth an
[12:03] eternal body her manifestation could
[12:07] come forth in his body all right
[12:09] so what is the redemptive plan that you
[12:12] talk about in the seals
[12:14] I thought we believe that the Prophet
[12:18] said everything Adam lost all right he
[12:24] said Jesus regained all right it's going
[12:29] to be restored right it's going to be
[12:33] brought to that seat in the redemptive
[12:35] plan that when it's finished then it
[12:38] will go back like it was because we'll
[12:42] be in eternity
[12:43] you have the Millennium is kind of a
[12:45] stopover that you'll be there with
[12:47] eternal the bride now with eternal life
[12:51] living in body spirit and soul in the
[12:54] millennial reign all right Lisi didn't
[12:57] step into the future home all right so
[13:00] then it shows by going to the future
[13:02] home that God had more in his plan and
[13:05] purpose than to just bring us into this
[13:09] world and even just to bring us and let
[13:13] us come to eternal life in body spirit
[13:15] and so he's going to take us to an
[13:17] eternity where we can get a message the
[13:19] Prophet said appear down through the
[13:22] ages after this world is over all right
[13:26] so it's gonna listen want something to
[13:29] look forward to
[13:30] okay so now as I said now get the point
[13:33] then the way God wanted it he started it
[13:37] we ought to return back to the way it
[13:39] was when he started it then we can go
[13:43] from there own and we can talk about
[13:46] Redemption in that way all right
[13:51] see when we get to that point okay now
[13:53] follow it then so then we come down to a
[13:56] position now and we were talking about
[13:58] it the last couple of messages of
[14:01] talking about
[14:04] that eternal life begins when you
[14:06] believe the same way your new birth
[14:10] begins when you believe it's not in full
[14:14] reality
[14:16] maybe you that's not the word for it I
[14:19] don't understand it ain't market but I
[14:21] know it ain't in manifestation until you
[14:23] receive it all right see then when it
[14:27] comes in to receiving it then you can
[14:29] believe all right now we'll get back to
[14:32] it in a minute and go back through it of
[14:34] what the new birth really is but now see
[14:39] I want to make these statements so
[14:41] you'll follow the point I believe the
[14:44] Bible and the prophet of God they taught
[14:50] the new birth taught it correctly all
[14:56] right I've got a quote laying here from
[14:57] the will read it in a minute from the
[14:59] future home that were he from the
[15:03] beginning from the beginning he said I
[15:09] never changed yet we say this and we say
[15:13] that and we go this way he said he never
[15:15] changed he said he'd never changed one
[15:19] hour older and doctrine all right now do
[15:22] we believe that see I believe that this
[15:26] as well as I believe John 3:16 I believe
[15:29] that just as well as I believe Malachi 4
[15:31] Luke 17 30 revelations Tim 7 you said
[15:39] yeah no no no I went over that with you
[15:42] and over and over it come and show me
[15:45] where he changed his doctrine now not
[15:48] made human mistakes error speeches or
[15:51] doings or towns or counties let's show
[15:54] me where he changed his doctrine because
[15:58] if you showed me where he changed his
[15:59] doctrine then we don't need to follow
[16:03] him
[16:08] Oh your your your I know but I'm an odd
[16:11] person but I believe that but that's who
[16:14] I believe I don't believe he changed his
[16:15] doctor my whole life is based on the
[16:19] fact that he didn't see then that away
[16:23] then I know how I'm not gonna argue with
[16:25] nobody about what they think he miss
[16:28] here he done that way no no I'm gonna
[16:32] believe exactly what I've always
[16:34] believed the messenger the human being
[16:38] had human errors in things as a human
[16:43] being but the message is the word of God
[16:51] it can't be tampered with the message
[16:54] now the message you get on over there
[16:57] and you'll try to quote it but just I'll
[16:59] run ahead we see then you get over you
[17:01] say but the message in the messenger one
[17:03] now how are you gonna make that if
[17:07] you're saying that the wrong way you've
[17:09] got the message in the messenger is one
[17:11] you gotta bread around being God so you
[17:15] say get it right the messenger could
[17:19] make human errors the human man the
[17:23] messenger but the message he brought is
[17:26] perfect and like I said there the other
[17:29] day on her emphasizing it you said yeah
[17:31] but he talked to a white horse rider
[17:34] nobody know where that ever preached the
[17:40] truth about the white horse rider it was
[17:43] sealed up in the Word of God and God
[17:46] winked at man's ignorance who tried to
[17:48] play around to try to figure it out
[17:51] learn accursed Larkin actually taught
[17:54] the white horse rider was the Antichrist
[17:57] before brother Branham ever come along
[18:00] but he wouldn't know prophet he didn't
[18:02] have no message to bring you except what
[18:05] Sean Cho said did he have a message well
[18:08] it's brother over here he's got signed
[18:09] what did he have a message he said
[18:11] silent world what did the Prophet say he
[18:14] said if you take it don't matter what
[18:16] happened now I'm trying to get this in
[18:18] my memory he said it doesn't matter what
[18:19] happens or
[18:21] goes on or whatever they claim if
[18:23] they'll come forth with the same old
[18:25] message then what would you say yeah but
[18:32] you're trying to get to the same old
[18:33] message now listen to what he's saying
[18:35] you try to bring the same you come out
[18:38] and try to preach Luther's message as
[18:40] the rapture you can't do it so then
[18:45] let's get it in the right order to
[18:47] understand okay now see then that's why
[18:51] I believe that the Bible and the
[18:55] prophets message declares that the new
[18:59] birth is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[19:05] that puts you into the body of Christ
[19:09] which is what Jesus taught in John 3
[19:14] that you must be born again and is
[19:17] exactly what took place on the depth in
[19:20] the column now that's a bold statement
[19:25] to make in there but I conclude that's
[19:28] right yeah but I brother I can read you
[19:30] where he said if I agreed or he said
[19:32] then just remember he's the Prophet I'm
[19:37] not you're not so you know we take words
[19:44] we take the word he and say I can give
[19:47] you a verbatim yeah but if it ain't of
[19:56] Revelation what is it okay and we're
[20:00] gonna get down to the revelation in a
[20:02] minute no that's I was intending to keep
[20:04] on going in a line I had to draw back
[20:07] all right so bear with me a little bit
[20:09] and see to be born again I believe
[20:14] according to the prophets message and
[20:16] the Bible that it emphatically declares
[20:19] that you must go through justification
[20:25] sanctification and the baptism of the
[20:29] Holy Spirit
[20:31] to be in the body of Christ to have
[20:35] eternal life and we're not talking about
[20:41] foolish virgins to get it later when I
[20:44] told my dad we're talking about here now
[20:45] ok so don't run out we'll see all right
[20:49] now see then you must go through the
[20:52] three steps of grace and by going
[20:56] through those three steps butter brown
[21:00] and set it on the future home yeah I got
[21:04] one we won't jump over a little bit so
[21:06] we want to get this point then we'll
[21:08] back up to something in the scriptures
[21:11] that I want you to read with me okay but
[21:16] listen go to number one be so you can
[21:19] see when I put a 1 a 1 B that means I
[21:22] got on this 1 2 3 4 and then something
[21:25] happens and I get this and where am I
[21:26] gonna put it
[21:27] I have to go rewrite all them ones and
[21:29] threes and threes so I just go to a 1 a
[21:31] 1 B 1 C you know just take that away
[21:34] sorry but listen to what he says now
[21:38] because we claim to believe that he's
[21:41] the Prophet all right so let's just get
[21:45] what he's a saying and he says here
[21:49] starting on paragraph 86 of the future
[21:52] home I live that title I've heard very
[21:56] little priests about it in the line that
[21:58] it's written
[21:59] that's an odd title the future home of
[22:02] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[22:06] bride oh but we're not earthly we're up
[22:10] in heaven we always was eternally come
[22:14] on notice how God makes it plain to us
[22:18] and if that wasn't a great confirmation
[22:21] of a good confirmation a good a great
[22:24] loving blessing from God when I seen
[22:27] this and see that since the boy first
[22:30] time ever Christ dealt with me
[22:32] I've always talked those three stages of
[22:35] grace
[22:38] you see yeah but I can show you where he
[22:40] said this here or he said this here that
[22:44] was 1964 okay I've got another one
[22:49] didn't bring it for them too but on
[22:52] paragraph 28 of the seeds he'll not be
[22:56] hired with a shook 1965 he said I never
[22:59] changed one iota in my doctrine now I've
[23:07] told you I believe he growed in grace
[23:13] and knowledge
[23:14] I believe he groped an understanding of
[23:16] the doctrine well yet he never changed
[23:19] the doctrine called you can't have a
[23:21] growth development I'd be like a baby
[23:23] you feeding as a baby and then when he
[23:25] gives about 10 or 12 year old it jumps
[23:27] off it becomes a monkey or a dog or a
[23:29] cat you'd be changing what you're trying
[23:32] to raise see don't don't do that with
[23:34] the gospel now watch what he says now
[23:37] the first step is repentance toward God
[23:39] then followers that is water baptism
[23:42] water baptism repent and be baptized in
[23:44] the name of Jesus Christ see water
[23:46] baptism Fowler's showing that repentance
[23:49] was genuine are to remit our our PI sins
[23:53] that has nothing to do with the future
[23:56] sin justification shuts off you PI sins
[24:00] that's nothing to do your future it just
[24:04] cuts the scene though all right now
[24:06] getting the point of what I'm saying
[24:08] getting the point that he always talked
[24:10] the three stages so he always told
[24:14] justification sanctification and the
[24:18] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[24:20] okay you say yeah but he said just now
[24:24] you're the one that's correcting me
[24:27] you don't get that I say something I'm
[24:31] tell you to read it this way and then
[24:33] you come up but I got there well you're
[24:34] the one that's correcting him and you're
[24:38] accusing me of correction him okay sorry
[24:44] nothing to do with the future you know
[24:47] the remains repentantly about two
[24:48] thousand times Jesus cried what for a
[24:50] remission taking away of PI sins has
[24:52] nothing to do with the future just your
[24:54] sins has been chopped off what you did
[24:57] you can't repent for what item done you
[25:00] never done it Adam did you just get
[25:03] forgiveness for what you've done the old
[25:06] nature is still dire even though you've
[25:10] repented you've asked God to forgive you
[25:13] no sins are gone but the old nature is
[25:19] still there so see there's for the
[25:23] problem with people they come to the
[25:25] altar they repent of their sins it chops
[25:28] off their PI sin they think they got
[25:30] everything and they're not talked it's
[25:36] got to get it something else look he
[25:44] talks to get some bright board and watch
[25:45] what he said I'm a long ways from being
[25:47] an artist here's a human heart here's a
[25:49] human heart now I would say only one
[25:51] thing
[25:52] right there you say yeah but you're
[25:54] gonna know I'm gonna tell you what I
[25:55] believe I believe that's the same human
[25:57] heart that he drugged it's in two stages
[26:00] one of them shows that the heart and the
[26:02] snake the other one shows the Dove your
[26:05] race is just out of this over here it's
[26:08] all taken care of
[26:09] you come forth with the dog that's the
[26:11] only thing and I'll tell you there's
[26:13] always been my thought to that you have
[26:17] your so it's alright here's the human
[26:19] heart here's the human heart now this
[26:20] one over here has a snake in it that's
[26:23] sin he has his life this one over here
[26:26] has a dove in it which is the Holy
[26:28] Spirit here he has life well this one
[26:31] here he has malice hatred in
[26:34] that's what is causing it it is this is
[26:37] this fella here well you see there's
[26:40] something else causing the doing so
[26:42] watch it now
[26:44] well this one over here has love and joy
[26:47] and long-suffering that's what does it
[26:49] down here then when you are asked are
[26:52] your forgiven of your sins you only done
[26:56] this taking that away right now you can
[27:00] take the snake out if you want to our
[27:01] lines of sin we can draw it out and do
[27:03] this it takes out sin but the old root
[27:07] of evil still there that's what we're
[27:11] going to get to read them bringing this
[27:12] but when you're asked you're forgiven
[27:14] you they send you only done that's taken
[27:16] that away but the thing that made you do
[27:19] it is still here still that that's the
[27:22] old root of evil it's still there notice
[27:26] then you repent and are baptized in the
[27:28] name of Jesus Christ if he gave you of
[27:31] your sin notice right then secondly
[27:33] comes sanctification which sets our mind
[27:37] in order for holiness to think right
[27:40] taking away sanctification is a Greek
[27:43] compound Greek word which means cleanse
[27:45] and set aside for service then the next
[27:48] comes the baptism mother
[27:49] fire and the Holy Ghost that God might
[27:52] dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses
[27:55] our hearts from sin and puts the Holy
[27:58] Ghost inside then you bring forth the
[28:00] same life that this is because that's it
[28:03] all right
[28:04] now once notice in the natural birth
[28:06] when a woman gives birth to a baby the
[28:09] natural life types of spiritual life
[28:12] then a woman gives birth to a baby the
[28:14] natural the first thing happens it's
[28:16] breaking the water in blood
[28:18] then spirit the life in the door grab
[28:20] the little feller spanking her run claps
[28:22] his hands and and the way he goes
[28:24] screaming water blood spirit now when a
[28:27] baby is born into the kingdom of God he
[28:31] comes the same way water blood spirit
[28:35] okay
[28:36] now he said that justification chops off
[28:43] you pi sins but what caused you to do it
[28:47] still
[28:48] which is the old root of evil right the
[28:51] old root of evil goes out of you okay
[28:56] now you can have these two if you want
[28:57] them then pull them up faced with a
[28:59] message called dedication which would be
[29:03] one see it in that heart still desires
[29:06] the root of evil to do wrong because the
[29:11] trees just cut down the root of evil is
[29:16] there how does it go out he can he can
[29:24] only be forgiven for what he done not
[29:27] what Adam done and on the aspergillus
[29:29] now what does it come to sanctification
[29:32] comes and cleans cleanses that heart
[29:38] from sin and roots out ever element of
[29:42] sin you remember Jesus the unclean
[29:45] spirit goes out of a man it walked in my
[29:47] place is secret wrath trying to find the
[29:49] unclean spirit goes out at
[29:50] sanctification come on
[29:56] one day we'll just read it questions and
[29:58] answers on the older ghosts he talking
[30:00] about Martin Luther the thing he
[30:01] preached that it's all right but you've
[30:04] got to be sanctified cleanse the root of
[30:07] evil taken out of you by the blood of
[30:09] Jesus Christ all right so now that
[30:14] unclean spirit goes out at
[30:16] sanctification but what kind of an
[30:19] individual are you jesus said it you
[30:23] find he comes he finds a house swept and
[30:25] garnished then he comes back in the what
[30:33] when out comes back in and it's worse
[30:35] because you don't the prophet covered it
[30:37] then the reason it's worse of seven
[30:40] times worse it becomes a religious demon
[30:42] and what is a religious demon he tells
[30:45] you you're saved I repented I baptized
[30:50] I've done well said I'm sanctified I
[30:53] quit this now quit that I don't do this
[30:55] and don't do that all that's gone from
[30:57] me
[30:59] I don't know about that Holy Ghost in
[31:02] time what's happened something come back
[31:08] in and is speaking back out
[31:11] be careful what you do in that situation
[31:14] because I contend and believe that
[31:18] that's where the biggest portion of the
[31:19] world is or the religious world is today
[31:24] they're certainly not at the new birth I
[31:27] mean we're not throwing off on how many
[31:30] of you are here what's over there that's
[31:31] group over here I don't preach like that
[31:33] and you know better I preach here but
[31:37] you know yourself the biggest portion of
[31:38] the world of the millions and millions
[31:42] and billions of so-called Christians
[31:45] that they're not born again well that's
[31:51] you and you go talk to them and just
[31:58] talk a little bit and see what they're
[32:00] born again or not
[32:01] it ain't no bother to make oh they don't
[32:03] matter it's not anything to me I'm not
[32:04] talking to them out there I'm talking
[32:07] here
[32:07] I won't mean you to understand we've got
[32:10] to go through justification
[32:12] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[32:14] Ghost which puts the life of God inside
[32:16] of us and run around them even covers in
[32:18] future home you just think about it you
[32:21] think about a person that's justified
[32:23] and sanctified we just read a statement
[32:26] did you notice it but a random says the
[32:29] Holy Ghost and fire comes and burns out
[32:32] oh that's left if you're repetitive he
[32:38] sins if the root of evil is going out
[32:41] what's left you is that enough
[32:46] you me what's left us right that's it
[32:53] don't want to go along with the word
[32:56] don't want to follow the rest of it all
[33:00] right come on yeah
[33:03] but that should be enough to let you
[33:05] know where I stand on that part all
[33:08] right and get it to the base is then
[33:11] that you can follow
[33:12] I never noticed it I want to I want them
[33:16] to pull up number one hey I had read
[33:22] this read this of John three
[33:31] I've always contended that Abraham that
[33:38] Nicodemus and Jesus didn't have a
[33:40] five-minute conversation they came
[33:45] together and they discussed things and
[33:48] as they were discussing Dining's then
[33:54] Jesus says you must be born again so
[34:00] evidently Nicodemus wanted to know what
[34:03] he talked right we know that you're a
[34:08] teacher come from God no man can do
[34:09] these things except God be with him
[34:11] right all right but think about it he
[34:16] wouldn't have five minute sermon it was
[34:21] over quite a period of time that's no
[34:24] problem I'm just trying to make a point
[34:26] to you then we think he run in and said
[34:30] well Jesus what do you believe you must
[34:31] be born again I don't understand Jesus
[34:37] told him exactly how to be born again
[34:46] when he said you must be born again he
[34:49] told him how like no I said the other
[34:51] day now he told him that where it
[34:53] couldn't even happen because there was
[34:54] no way it could happen at that time he
[34:56] had to go die but that's what Jesus was
[34:58] telling him let's read it and see
[35:02] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[35:04] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[35:06] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[35:08] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[35:10] come from God
[35:11] where no man can do these miracles that
[35:13] thou doest except God be with it pretty
[35:15] good
[35:17] pretty good discussion right a pretty
[35:19] good point that he's making he gave him
[35:22] the height to the teachers he gave him
[35:24] the height of knowing that God had to be
[35:27] with him he just didn't say you must be
[35:31] born again and cut him off that's what I
[35:32] want you to read jesus answered and said
[35:36] unto Him verily verily I say unto thee
[35:38] except a man be born again he cannot see
[35:42] the kingdom of God
[35:43] Nicodemus answered to him how can a man
[35:46] be born when he's old
[35:47] in the end of the second time into his
[35:50] mother's wound and be born jesus
[35:52] answered verily verily I say unto thee
[35:55] except a man be born of water and of the
[35:59] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[36:02] of God that which is born of the flesh
[36:05] is flesh and that which is born of the
[36:08] Spirit is spirit he's explaining to
[36:14] Nicodemus what he needs to go through to
[36:20] be born again
[36:21] now listen Marvel not that I said unto
[36:26] thee you must be born again the wind
[36:29] bloweth where it listeth and thou
[36:31] hearest the sound thereof but canst not
[36:34] tell whence it cometh and whither it
[36:36] goes so he's every one that is born of
[36:39] the Spirit Nicodemus answered and said
[36:46] unto him how can these things be jesus
[36:50] answered and said unto Him art thou
[36:52] master of Israel no it's not these
[36:55] things now if you understand what I'm
[36:59] getting at now Jesus is gonna tell him
[37:03] exactly what he needs to do and tell him
[37:06] what he's gonna do
[37:08] cause this is Nicodemus is still talking
[37:13] John 3 was the Lord Jesus talking to
[37:18] Nicodemus not to your name to Nicodemus
[37:23] but come on you asked him we couldn't do
[37:28] jesus saith unto Him are there a master
[37:30] of Israel no it's not these things
[37:31] verily verily I say unto thee we speak
[37:34] that we do know and testify that we have
[37:39] seen and you receive not our witness and
[37:42] what you if I've told you earthly things
[37:46] and you believe not how sure you believe
[37:50] if I tell you of heavenly thought
[37:53] talking to Nicodemus no man has ascended
[37:57] up to heaven look what he said but he
[37:59] that came down from heaven even the Son
[38:01] of Man which is in heaven he's still
[38:04] talking to Nicodemus as Moses lifted up
[38:07] the serpent in the wilderness even so
[38:09] must the Son of Man be lifted up
[38:11] what's he explaining he's telling him
[38:14] what he come to do and what it's going
[38:16] to take
[38:16] he's gonna take his death the one from
[38:19] heaven to come to earth and die for
[38:21] mankind he tells me more about the new
[38:24] birth than just to say you must be
[38:26] warned again I never never put that
[38:29] together never saw it - no - that night
[38:31] there brother faughn he was bringing the
[38:33] scripture and I said oh that's Nicodemus
[38:37] he explained it to Nicodemus whosoever
[38:42] now watch him and his Moses lifted
[38:44] serpent in the wilderness even so much
[38:46] the Son of Man be lifted up that
[38:47] whosoever believeth in him should not
[38:54] perish but have eternal life
[38:59] then he's telling him he needs to be
[39:02] born again and he's telling him what he
[39:05] needs to do is believe on him right
[39:09] watch him for God so loved the world
[39:12] anybody else has quoted that scripture
[39:15] but did we ever thank he's quoting it to
[39:17] Nicodemus
[39:19] you've coating it he's telling Nicodemus
[39:22] or our God so loved the world that He
[39:24] gave His only begotten Son that
[39:27] whosoever believeth in him should not
[39:29] perish but have everlasting life
[39:32] that's it our God sent not his son into
[39:35] the world to condemn the world was it
[39:39] the world through him might be saved he
[39:44] that believeth on him is not condemned
[39:48] but he that believeth not is condemned
[39:52] already why because he had not believed
[39:55] in the name of the only begotten Son of
[39:58] God
[39:59] a couple more verses go down below there
[40:02] who was he talking to who was the great
[40:06] scripture that says for God so loved the
[40:08] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[40:10] was to Nicodemus Nicodemus couldn't
[40:14] understand it right but he plainly tells
[40:20] him of his birth his life and why that
[40:28] he would even say God must be with you
[40:34] Nicodemus recognized every bit of that
[40:38] but then he told him what's he got
[40:42] sitting out his son into the world to
[40:44] condemn the world went to the world
[40:45] through him might be say he that
[40:47] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[40:52] that believeth not is condemned already
[40:54] because he didn't believe that Jesus
[40:59] Christ was Almighty God they come to die
[41:02] for the sins of mankind that was -
[41:06] Nicodemus there wasn't no five minute
[41:09] sermon was over a long period of time
[41:16] maybe hours they said and discussed and
[41:22] he explained to him what he come to do
[41:24] Nicodemus winds up and gets up walks out
[41:27] because he can't understand
[41:31] do we understand do we understand search
[41:41] this was preaching to Nicodemus giving
[41:45] him a change giving him a change but he
[41:53] couldn't follow it I never thought about
[42:00] it where he said for God so loved the
[42:01] world he gave you don't about I thought
[42:03] it hasn't been it to me and you and it
[42:05] is come on that's to you and me but who
[42:09] was it
[42:09] talking to to start with to the man that
[42:13] come to talk to him and he couldn't
[42:17] understand it
[42:20] Nicodemus was the teacher the greatest
[42:27] of all of them it can't be understood by
[42:30] intellectual conception what about
[42:36] Nicodemus getting all of that put before
[42:38] him and offered all of that but turned
[42:40] it down and Peter that couldn't even
[42:42] sign his own name accepted it what was
[42:47] the difference won by an intellectual
[42:52] conception was following in doing which
[42:56] was Nicodemus a great man but a render
[42:59] said he would be given eternal life for
[43:00] the standard he took for the Lord Jesus
[43:04] Nicodemus in Khmer used to delegate
[43:07] eternal life but you're not can't depend
[43:13] on the fact that waiting for eternal
[43:14] life you know saying well hope we hope
[43:18] we gotta get settled here it's gonna be
[43:22] on this side where we get it settled
[43:23] then if there's anything there that's
[43:25] left up to him all right but do you get
[43:28] it
[43:32] now the new birth the baptism of the
[43:36] Holy Ghost and being born again is the
[43:38] one in the same it is an individual
[43:44] being baptized into the body of Jesus
[43:46] Christ and giving him eternal life now
[43:55] we get to it and it to three weeks it'll
[43:58] be a thought that we've got to pick up
[44:01] well why would brother Branham say
[44:02] certain things why would he explain
[44:08] things in a way that sounds like it's
[44:11] totally contrary to the other statements
[44:15] that he's made Nicodemus is a perfect
[44:23] example he said right there listen to
[44:25] every bit of it and Jesus said how don't
[44:28] you know I mean and he's seen enough
[44:30] babies born and you seen the fact that
[44:33] water blood spirit brings a life
[44:35] anything in your own to know what I'm
[44:38] doing and I'm here teaching this is my
[44:40] doctrine my doctrine is you must be born
[44:44] again
[44:48] they said but I just can't understand
[44:50] how you do that we can't be done by
[44:56] Emelec all right now let's pick it up
[45:01] see then by the prophets message the
[45:04] Bible in a statement I might want to go
[45:07] then by putting them all together I
[45:10] believe the new birth the baptism of the
[45:12] Holy Ghost and the morning any
[45:13] experience is the one on the side All
[45:19] Right see you take it and you'll say
[45:20] yeah but I believe it's an uber starts
[45:22] this way then this comes in this way go
[45:25] a little further and they go through the
[45:26] further you can't use it that way you
[45:30] can use a growth development but not
[45:33] change something to make this to be one
[45:36] thing in this to be the psycho thing and
[45:39] this to be the third time
[45:42] you can't do that you got to come to it
[45:44] like it is
[45:45] all right listen so we read it will read
[45:50] it again going at the number one now
[45:53] we'll get started on her one notes
[45:55] instead of the way the NC and D and
[45:59] listen to what cuz we read this over and
[46:01] over this is out of the church age book
[46:03] page 144 some learning church age which
[46:06] is the church age book he explains where
[46:10] people misunderstands him when he gives
[46:12] an altar call for people to come I I
[46:16] cast the net to respond to the people I
[46:19] asked him to come forward and receive
[46:21] the Holy Spirit he says my Pentecostal
[46:24] friends upon hearing me say that believe
[46:26] that I am inviting people to come
[46:28] forward to be baptized with the Holy
[46:30] Ghost because they are already born
[46:32] again so when I fight those who are
[46:35] spirit filled to come and deal with
[46:37] those who have answered the invitation
[46:39] to receive the spirit these dear ones
[46:42] surge forward to deal with the people in
[46:45] such matter as to encourage them to
[46:47] yield to God and believe to speaking in
[46:50] to speak in tongues okay well because he
[46:54] doesn't went through one thing they
[46:55] gotta go over to another thing okay they
[46:58] don't teach justification is speaking in
[47:00] tongues they teach the baptism of the
[47:04] holy ghost he's speaking in tongue I saw
[47:09] one the other day that I'd never seen
[47:10] you ever heard run around and say this
[47:12] he said the Baptist believe in water
[47:14] babblers water baptism unto regeneration
[47:19] that's power phrase anybody very close I
[47:24] told you something all the time over and
[47:28] over cuz were coming from go find you a
[47:32] Baptist and talk to them you can go from
[47:36] Baptist Church to a Methodist Church
[47:37] they accept your baptism you go to
[47:40] Baptist to anywhere that but if you go
[47:43] from a Methodist to the Baptist you're
[47:44] going to get baptized
[47:50] they don't matter father son Holy Ghost
[47:52] ain't got nothing do with it
[47:54] so when brother round said and I said
[47:56] Lord I've always wondered was that the
[47:59] way it was he said they're actually
[48:03] believing that's the water baptism under
[48:06] regeneration I said well okay well could
[48:15] we believe and what did they try to get
[48:23] him to speak in tongues this has caused
[48:24] a great deal of confusion and I want to
[48:27] tell you exactly what I mean I mean for
[48:30] the sinner to come forward and be born
[48:33] again which is to be baptized into the
[48:36] body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which
[48:39] is exactly what took place now look at
[48:42] all you exactly's exactly what took
[48:44] place at Pentecost when the church was
[48:49] launched in other words to be born of
[48:54] the Spirit of God is to be truly
[48:56] baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one
[48:58] in the same so there's your new birth
[49:05] baptism I mean new birth you know
[49:08] baptism in the Holy Ghost and born-again
[49:10] experience put together one time he said
[49:14] that's what took place at penny college
[49:17] I've taught you that over and over and
[49:20] over those disciples for three and a
[49:22] half years went through justification of
[49:24] sanctification but they never received
[49:27] the baptism in the Holy Spirit until the
[49:30] upper room you can talk about being born
[49:39] again and start out and brother Adam
[49:41] does I gave you these he says your new
[49:44] birth begins when you believe I believe
[49:50] and he got him to do with the answer to
[49:52] the question the question is while he
[49:54] will get on over later and say I can
[49:57] prove that you're born into the body I
[50:00] that you're you I could prove that
[50:02] you're born again I believed it and said
[50:05] baptized into the body for the gift that
[50:08] sounds contrary but the answer is that
[50:14] it'll be taken care of it'll be there
[50:18] and you'll see how simple it is
[50:19] but listen so how many times we went
[50:23] over this statement what is the new
[50:27] birth then brother Brandon what is the
[50:32] new birth you say well brother Brandon
[50:40] what is a new birth it is the revelation
[50:43] of Jesus Christ personally to you not
[50:51] you shook her hand join the church done
[50:53] something different seda Creed promised
[50:58] to say about Kota its Christ in you that
[51:02] is the revelation that the church was
[51:05] built upon now in a minute we're gonna
[51:07] get to something that we're gonna put
[51:10] two things together the Lord willing so
[51:14] he goes on in Christ the mystery he says
[51:17] what is it it's Christ being revealed
[51:19] and he is the word and when the word is
[51:24] revealed it expresses itself the new
[51:29] burns reveals this he says the new birth
[51:32] is Christ is a revelation that God has
[51:35] to reveal to you this great mystery and
[51:39] that's when you earth great mystery and
[51:44] that's the new birth God is known by
[51:50] simplicity and revelation of Jesus
[51:53] Christ to the most illiterate person
[51:57] we went through that we've been over
[52:03] this statement from Patmos vision
[52:04] they've got these and they're put on the
[52:07] Internet where people can read them even
[52:09] if they don't use them here but they'll
[52:10] catch up and you can read it and he says
[52:15] while you're talking on Revelation ask
[52:17] him to give you a revelation of it where
[52:20] it can only be known by revelation now
[52:24] watch all these scriptures appear and
[52:26] you can only be saved by revelation well
[52:31] brother Dale I didn't get no revelation
[52:33] when I got saved you didn't for some
[52:41] reason come to the altar I've tried to
[52:44] make it so simple you didn't for some
[52:47] reason come to the altar and said I want
[52:49] to be saved
[52:50] something's dealing with me well
[52:54] something is revealing to you that you
[52:57] need to be saved
[53:01] why don't you take it that way you don't
[53:05] have that word or I didn't get the seals
[53:07] when I got born again no no you won't
[53:15] I've said it and I mean it and I've
[53:18] stuck with it for 50 years every person
[53:21] in the world hypothetical statement but
[53:24] every person in the world could stand it
[53:26] to faith in the father's and they'd
[53:30] still be no change of the body until the
[53:33] message would come for that to take
[53:35] place your wonderful world to live in
[53:41] but a staff stages it's got to be
[53:44] developed so you can only be known and
[53:49] you can only be saved you have knowledge
[53:51] of it intellectually but you can't be
[53:53] saved until it's reveal to you what no
[53:57] man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[53:59] the Holy Ghost now how did we cover that
[54:04] we gave you a lot of them I had a lot
[54:06] more to read the no man can say that
[54:08] jesus is a crop no man can call Jesus
[54:11] the crop
[54:12] without the Holy Ghost without the
[54:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost then it's not
[54:16] you saying that Jesus is the Christ it's
[54:20] the father speaking out of you to say it
[54:24] because it's my revelation then that's
[54:28] what I mean you have a knowledge of it
[54:32] intellectually but you can't be saved
[54:34] into it's revealed to you
[54:35] no man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[54:38] the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible
[54:40] says no man can say Jesus is the Christ
[54:44] until he has received the Holy Ghost
[54:54] you don't know it yourself until the
[54:58] Holy Spirit has revealed it to you and
[55:02] he's becoming you no man can call Jesus
[55:06] the Christ no man could call Jesus the
[55:14] Christ without a revelation
[55:18] then we went through those others I want
[55:22] you to read this one so pull up number
[55:24] six now you know what will be saved by
[55:26] Revelation so now what is the new birth
[55:32] this is from spoken words of regional
[55:34] seed now for the birth of the word is
[55:38] Christ not have polluted our
[55:42] denominations the early church no
[55:45] denomination is just the word and spirit
[55:47] irrigated what happened Jesus sowed the
[55:50] word right the disciples went to the
[55:54] upper room the word had been sown the
[55:58] Holy Ghost came and irrigated the word
[56:00] they got certain things like Peter
[56:03] saying thou art the Christ God could
[56:06] reveal that to him but that was not a
[56:10] born again new birth experience he could
[56:17] say to the like a little woman touch the
[56:19] hem of his garment
[56:21] names could be revealed to mankind it
[56:25] was revealed to Mary he said be it unto
[56:28] me according to thy word but they never
[56:32] brought the new birth right so now look
[56:39] just a word and spirit irrigated brother
[56:43] God laid the word down like that and the
[56:47] Holy Spirit irrigated it and there she
[56:50] went she brought forth children what is
[56:56] the new birth it's the birth of the word
[56:59] what is the baptism when the Holy Ghost
[57:01] the fulfillment of the word it was spoke
[57:07] of all the way through he came to birth
[57:09] in a group of people she just told him
[57:14] you to receive power after the Holy
[57:16] Ghost is come upon you all those things
[57:21] would happen so now what's he saying
[57:25] look at number 7 you must be born again
[57:30] now folks teachers will bring folks
[57:33] verse true prophets will bring the birth
[57:36] bring the word the birth of the word
[57:40] Christ false prophets will bring false
[57:43] birth the birth of churches and that
[57:51] birth of the word what is the new birth
[57:58] read your simple parable of the sower of
[58:02] the seed the son of man was a sort of
[58:03] the seat I preached this for 40 years to
[58:06] the son of man is the only sower of the
[58:12] seed now you want to go in for ours in
[58:17] the Bible with that and take every
[58:19] parable and relate to it that Jesus
[58:22] Christ sowed and if that parable is
[58:25] talking about you and me and we must
[58:28] believe it is as we are the children of
[58:30] the kingdom right then if it is that
[58:33] parable is speaking of the fact of you
[58:36] and I becoming the children of God
[58:43] there was a God's a whole plan and
[58:45] purpose all right now think about it
[58:49] look at this when I was spoken word go
[58:52] to number 8 Oh God's sons must be the
[58:59] same yes sir to be born of the word and
[59:04] spirit brings us back to the spoken word
[59:09] again like in John 3 the new birth to
[59:15] ever person that made them a son of God
[59:18] brought them to John 3:6 3 and that you
[59:24] must be born again don't stop reading to
[59:31] be born of the water and spirit what
[59:34] does it do then it brings you right back
[59:38] again unto the place of where you should
[59:43] have been at the beginning now do you
[59:49] remember what I said while ago you
[59:53] remember what I said start with God
[59:57] started his church with Adam and Eve
[1:00:00] with eternal life and their soul body
[1:00:02] and spirit not eternal okay now the new
[1:00:06] birth brings you to want back like you
[1:00:08] should have been at the beginning which
[1:00:09] is what eternal life in your soul
[1:00:12] body and spirit still of the world now
[1:00:17] he can come on the scene to start
[1:00:19] dealing with the redemption of the body
[1:00:22] and the spirit realm the cleansing
[1:00:25] thought what are you reading see that's
[1:00:28] the reason Christ died bring us right
[1:00:31] back again to were sons of God because
[1:00:40] right back to sons and daughters of a
[1:00:42] living God the new birth brings that and
[1:00:48] don't bring the growth development to
[1:00:50] Adam handed ad in the garden know that
[1:00:53] rose with a statue of a perfect man
[1:00:54] we've got a long ways to go but we got
[1:00:56] to get at the bottom of the pyramid does
[1:00:57] ever start cuz if you don't you're gonna
[1:01:00] be like most of the people of the
[1:01:01] message like one brother said he said
[1:01:03] see there it says Holy Spirit right up
[1:01:05] here and said if you believe that that's
[1:01:08] the new work you got to turn it upside
[1:01:09] down that was what was that I'm sorry I
[1:01:18] kind of like what happened the other day
[1:01:24] even some of you said it his brother
[1:01:28] Dale used to tell us someone's hopes and
[1:01:30] now we believe it first
[1:01:31] hell don't you hurt it now listen
[1:01:43] so what is the new birth it's the word
[1:01:46] planted that you hear and the Holy Ghost
[1:01:50] it comes to irrigate that word or make
[1:01:52] it alive right it brings you to the new
[1:01:56] birth it brings you to a position of
[1:02:00] what faith faith brings you to a
[1:02:12] position of faith so we're gonna get
[1:02:17] we're just trying to get a little
[1:02:18] background to bring it down to faith
[1:02:21] then you're at the bottom of the pyramid
[1:02:23] we'll go up I asked you to read brother
[1:02:25] Branham you see him saying that's got to
[1:02:29] get to have faith you got to get born
[1:02:32] again now faith if you listen to rage
[1:02:35] you'll see what he's saying he's right
[1:02:37] in the beginning to where he starts now
[1:02:39] some of the statements is on over later
[1:02:41] so just listen to it read it I'm asking
[1:02:44] you I'm gonna try to get away from the
[1:02:50] sarcastic statements but I can't have it
[1:02:53] if you ain't got enough gumption to go
[1:02:56] read and listen don't come and tell me
[1:02:59] I'm wrong and for heaven's sake don't go
[1:03:04] tell somebody else I'm wrong if I'm
[1:03:07] right I asked you to read the book I
[1:03:13] give you the quotes but I'm accused of
[1:03:15] everything in the book out of it not one
[1:03:18] thing about it I'll fight for you till
[1:03:21] the day I die to try to get you the word
[1:03:25] to where you can see it you may not like
[1:03:28] me you may not understand me you may
[1:03:31] hate my ways it takes one thing about it
[1:03:33] come and show me where I'm wrong I don't
[1:03:36] mean that statement to be are sarcastic
[1:03:38] Reena
[1:03:39] if you're telling me and you show me I'm
[1:03:41] wrong I can be corrected but I'm not
[1:03:45] gonna listen to your system a little
[1:03:47] well brother random saying that we hear
[1:03:48] any better Adam said it over here you
[1:03:51] know all the message together because
[1:03:54] you got to remember one time I don't
[1:03:55] care what you quote
[1:03:56] run around and say it listen I don't
[1:03:59] care what you quote that he said a
[1:04:01] verbatim quote you can't make that
[1:04:04] contrary to worry said in the that we
[1:04:08] started on the future home then I talked
[1:04:11] three processes from the beginning and
[1:04:14] that I never changed in doctrine now you
[1:04:19] make them fit we know you don't see what
[1:04:25] I've done for the past month or so he's
[1:04:27] taking statements brother run and say it
[1:04:29] placing them in order and showing you
[1:04:31] you know the exactly what he's talking
[1:04:33] about
[1:04:33] he said you're no new birth begins when
[1:04:37] you believe that's exactly 100 percent
[1:04:40] correct it's not in the full
[1:04:43] manifestation he's like a child begotten
[1:04:50] let's talk about faith for a minute I
[1:04:54] think go to number nine
[1:04:58] henkle works his faith express and
[1:05:02] remember remember what we're saying
[1:05:05] back up you can't be saved without a
[1:05:09] revelation and it's the revelation of
[1:05:14] Jesus Christ personally to you not a
[1:05:17] revelation of you to you brother told me
[1:05:21] he said I see Who I am I said and
[1:05:24] brother for any quarter to other daily
[1:05:27] my brother said I see Who I am
[1:05:29] now baby I can see who Jesus is I said
[1:05:32] you're wrong that's sound good I said
[1:05:35] you're wrong you've got to see who Jesus
[1:05:37] is first cuz it's Jesus gonna make you
[1:05:41] what you are
[1:05:43] so it's Jesus first so what is a new
[1:05:47] birth the revelation not of you the
[1:05:50] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:05:53] you Joyce a revelation now let's get on
[1:05:58] this revelation to me now faith is a
[1:06:01] revelation from God that faith is a
[1:06:03] revelation that's where I want to stay
[1:06:05] or just a moment it's a revelation he
[1:06:07] has revealed it to you by His grace
[1:06:10] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[1:06:14] yourself up into faith listen you're a
[1:06:19] how faith is gift to you by the grace of
[1:06:22] God and God reveals it to you
[1:06:25] therefore faith is a revelation and the
[1:06:29] whole Church of God is built upon the
[1:06:32] revelation faith is a revelation okay
[1:06:38] wait a number-10 rapture but to the
[1:06:43] church the bride the rapture is a
[1:06:46] revelation to her it's been revealed its
[1:06:52] scuse me it's revealed to her and to
[1:06:55] Revelation the true Bride of Christ will
[1:06:57] be waiting for that revelation of the
[1:06:59] rapture I think we've waited 50 years
[1:07:03] don't you look there it is a revelation
[1:07:10] for the revelation is faith you cannot
[1:07:15] have a revelation without it being faith
[1:07:19] now get to statement then go to statue a
[1:07:26] very bland you cannot have a revelation
[1:07:29] without to be in faith so faith is the
[1:07:33] new birth which is a revelation of Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ personally to you faith is a
[1:07:44] revelation because it's something that's
[1:07:45] revealed to you who was revealed to Abel
[1:07:47] right come on faith is a revelation
[1:07:52] faith is something that has been
[1:07:53] revealed to you like it was to Abraham
[1:07:56] they could call anything contrary to
[1:07:59] what hid what had been revealed to him
[1:08:02] as though it wasn't sure now faith
[1:08:08] that's what faith is is the revelation
[1:08:11] of God the church is built upon the
[1:08:14] revelation the whole entire body okay
[1:08:19] now what does Hebrews 11:1 say let's see
[1:08:26] how sharor this new birth is let's find
[1:08:28] out how all of this all the years that
[1:08:32] people had just taught will the new
[1:08:34] birth the new birth is the new birth
[1:08:35] anew
[1:08:36] then you'll see why brother Brown said
[1:08:38] that's why the baptism when Holy Ghost
[1:08:40] been so incorrectly talk so if it's the
[1:08:43] baptism been incorrectly the new birth
[1:08:45] has been incorrectly taught the
[1:08:46] born-again experience has been
[1:08:48] incorrectly talk it's just something you
[1:08:50] believe something you do something you
[1:08:51] do
[1:08:51] shout you're speaking tongue what is the
[1:08:54] evidence of the Holy Ghost let's see if
[1:09:01] you can really hold on the one evidence
[1:09:04] from the Holy Ghost really is to look
[1:09:08] what he says on now faith is the
[1:09:11] substance of things hoped for the
[1:09:16] evidence those things not seen
[1:09:19] that's an evidence faith is an evidence
[1:09:22] we don't read the prophet mentioned
[1:09:24] don't worry about just hold on faith
[1:09:26] isn't evidence what is your evidence of
[1:09:30] the whole to go what is your evidence of
[1:09:36] the holy go I see how did I cried I
[1:09:38] spoke in tongues I believe the Prophet I
[1:09:40] did then words out in evidence words out
[1:09:44] of faith when Satan can impersonate
[1:09:46] every one of them you've got to have
[1:09:49] something in your experience that it's
[1:09:52] Satan cannot impersonate if not did you
[1:09:58] don't have a substance you got a
[1:10:01] flim-flam the idea of a mental
[1:10:03] conception sorry look what he says now
[1:10:08] speak to this mountain number two well
[1:10:16] he says now by God over our hearts to
[1:10:20] this understanding the faith is not a
[1:10:23] myth neither is it something that's a
[1:10:30] you just imagined faith is positive
[1:10:35] faith is the substance and doesn't say
[1:10:40] faith is a substance faith is the this
[1:10:45] I'm not an English part so don't worry
[1:10:47] about it but I know that D has a lot to
[1:10:50] do with it because I did know this in
[1:10:52] the Baptist Church
[1:10:53] John was called John the Baptist because
[1:10:55] they wasn't but one we know that in the
[1:10:58] Baptist Church that there was one John
[1:11:01] the Baptist so they mean singular right
[1:11:09] the faith is not a minute needed asepsis
[1:11:12] assume you're my party faith is a
[1:11:14] substance just the same as this glass is
[1:11:17] now where do we get to your substance
[1:11:20] and your experience being the same let's
[1:11:23] see if you can hold us that real see if
[1:11:25] your substance your faith and your
[1:11:28] experience will all turn out to be the
[1:11:30] same come on
[1:11:39] faith is the substance just the same as
[1:11:42] this Lyceus it's the same as this book
[1:11:45] is faith is the substance of things
[1:11:47] hoped for the evidence now how many how
[1:11:50] many quotes do you need some run around
[1:11:53] their faith is it positive something you
[1:11:56] have and he said it's even like this if
[1:11:59] you're hungry and want something to eat
[1:12:02] and I give you a quarter he said that's
[1:12:07] the purchasing power of the loaf of
[1:12:10] bread that's the substance that's how
[1:12:15] real a substance but you can't shorten
[1:12:17] nobody else go try to tell somebody
[1:12:22] about your revelation doses together
[1:12:28] let's talk go get you it now not
[1:12:31] throwing I want to go get you good
[1:12:33] Baptists or something and saying I want
[1:12:35] you to know Lord spoke to me one day and
[1:12:37] said he's real mmm might be to you and
[1:12:47] that's all it is to you
[1:12:48] it was to nobody else in the world that
[1:12:51] day if it was there was some personal to
[1:12:54] themselves okay let's go same as his
[1:13:02] vice role at home we ain't finished with
[1:13:04] 13 we got a good better read role 13
[1:13:08] yeah we just finished well okay well in
[1:13:10] 30 roll it up until we get to the read I
[1:13:13] give the regiment what my subject is how
[1:13:18] faith in God now we're tired of God's
[1:13:21] blessed word that faith comes by hearing
[1:13:23] and hearing by the word or of the word
[1:13:27] that's good in hearing by the word or
[1:13:30] other word now first there's also an
[1:13:33] experience
[1:13:39] what is your experience the faith is
[1:13:47] also an experience in many times faith
[1:13:49] is had listen by a former experience
[1:13:53] makes faith grow i believe that don't
[1:13:56] you
[1:13:57] former experience makes it grow so then
[1:14:02] you've got something to hold on to and
[1:14:03] you stand on that to get something else
[1:14:05] as it grows okay
[1:14:07] faith being the substance of things Oh
[1:14:10] far the evidence of things not seen
[1:14:13] so many people fail to find the real
[1:14:16] meaning of what faith is some people
[1:14:19] believe that faith is some sensation are
[1:14:22] some emotion
[1:14:23] I see how did that crying spoken tell me
[1:14:26] come on but the Bible said that faith is
[1:14:29] the substance of things hoped for now
[1:14:32] some things it's a mental conception of
[1:14:35] the word but that is not right faith is
[1:14:42] the substance that a mental conception
[1:14:45] don't you but that's not right faith is
[1:14:48] a substance faith is not a myth
[1:14:50] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:14:52] for the evidence now look to have an
[1:14:56] evidence it must be a substance if you
[1:15:08] got an evidence tonight
[1:15:10] and you can't make it in short as a
[1:15:12] substance then I have to say it I doubt
[1:15:15] your evidence I'm evil what are we gonna
[1:15:22] do to have an evidence you claiming
[1:15:29] evidence of something don't you the
[1:15:31] reason you're born again all right he's
[1:15:35] your evidence a substance
[1:15:39] if not why's your face get red when I
[1:15:42] say that you know what I mean
[1:15:49] can you say I have an evidence brother
[1:15:53] Dale
[1:15:53] that is a very substance of the gospel
[1:15:58] my evidence will fit ever born-again
[1:16:01] believer that's in the body of Jesus
[1:16:04] Christ will yours because my evidence is
[1:16:15] exactly what the Prophet said it's
[1:16:17] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[1:16:19] I love that wording agrees a lot of them
[1:16:23] agree but I do while they're agree stops
[1:16:26] and they don't agrees with word right to
[1:16:33] have an evidence they just land on my
[1:16:36] desk for about two months to have an
[1:16:39] evidence it must be a substance how sure
[1:16:44] is your evidence so it is not just
[1:16:50] something that you imagine in your mind
[1:16:52] it's something that absolutely you have
[1:16:57] it's something that you possess in your
[1:17:01] own being and what is it
[1:17:06] it's the evidence of things that you
[1:17:09] have hope for what is your hope I don't
[1:17:16] know them one hope that's in Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ now all the things he does I can
[1:17:25] have hoping but the first start I gotta
[1:17:26] have hope in Jesus Christ because I
[1:17:30] can't trust nothing else he's got to
[1:17:32] start in Jesus Christ that's why when
[1:17:34] you get the new birth you're only gonna
[1:17:35] be born again as an individual in the
[1:17:38] body of Christ now there's a group
[1:17:40] collective
[1:17:43] this is Gentiles it's evidence that you
[1:17:47] have hope for it's the evidence of
[1:17:49] things that you'd not do not have as yet
[1:17:54] I'm reading him cologne which you have
[1:17:57] the authority of God to say that you
[1:18:00] have it now how many years have you
[1:18:07] heard brother Dale preach this you got
[1:18:10] to confess it before you can get it
[1:18:15] nobody in the Bible ever received the
[1:18:18] new birth without hearing the word first
[1:18:19] show me Bible or anyone without hearing
[1:18:23] the word from somebody a statement from
[1:18:25] somebody mama said it daddy said short
[1:18:28] to me you say with the prophets I don't
[1:18:33] mind you going that way
[1:18:34] remember if he's a prophet prophet he
[1:18:38] connects his experience back to the
[1:18:42] Prophet before him so he's already hurt
[1:18:47] he said when I wasn't Elijah he never
[1:18:49] heard nobody I questioned that thought
[1:18:56] because God made contact with it he knew
[1:19:02] I loved him listen it's not something
[1:19:09] that you kindly push yourself to I've
[1:19:12] noticed so much of that in my meetings
[1:19:15] that people try to work themselves up
[1:19:17] into something to make them believe now
[1:19:20] you can't do that you're just beating
[1:19:23] the ire but faith is something that's
[1:19:25] just no no but faith is something that's
[1:19:32] just as calm and settle as it can be
[1:19:35] it's taking God at His Word and having
[1:19:39] assurance in your heart the God is able
[1:19:41] to keep what he has said that he would
[1:19:43] do and will perform everything that he
[1:19:45] said he would do I've noticed that many
[1:19:47] times people think they must be must be
[1:19:50] prayed for that's all right we should
[1:19:52] pray for each other or that their hands
[1:19:55] might be are some evangelists
[1:19:57] hands must be ministered that's alright
[1:20:01] that'll bring contacts and so forth of
[1:20:05] faith but real unadulterated faith is
[1:20:09] taking God and His Word real faith is
[1:20:16] taking God in his word
[1:20:25] what is your evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:30] now we're gonna say a little bit let's
[1:20:32] get it now your faith is the substance
[1:20:34] of the substance of things you hope for
[1:20:36] and it's an experience and don't you see
[1:20:40] what happened Jesus so do word they walk
[1:20:46] with him for three and a half years held
[1:20:49] in that position the unclean spirit
[1:20:50] drove out all the time had the ministry
[1:20:53] went out and heal the sick cast out
[1:20:55] Devils if ever but then they had to go
[1:21:02] to the Upper Room to wait I like their
[1:21:06] experience don't you pretty good
[1:21:10] experience just stayed for three and a
[1:21:11] half years he left mom and daddy look at
[1:21:15] Peter goes on their wife said honey I'll
[1:21:16] see you later
[1:21:17] where you going I don't know who are you
[1:21:18] going with I'm following this guy I mean
[1:21:22] you say you just making them all cry I'm
[1:21:23] not making a mockery I'm just telling
[1:21:25] God's honest truth that's what he done
[1:21:30] remember they didn't have no welfare
[1:21:32] take care of his wife while he was gone
[1:21:39] you hear him okay I'm silly but is it
[1:21:42] the truth look at what all of those
[1:21:46] apostles done and walked with him in the
[1:21:53] word one day that word was made alive
[1:22:00] neither Holy Ghost has come here bring
[1:22:02] your remembers whatsoever things I see
[1:22:05] it but rest it even teach you things to
[1:22:08] come what is your evidence is it faith
[1:22:14] if it is faith is the substance faith is
[1:22:17] the revealed Word of God
[1:22:21] right so my evidence has to be the
[1:22:25] revealed Word of God did you get my
[1:22:30] evidence
[1:22:32] of the Holy Ghost has to have to do with
[1:22:35] the word being revealed now you tell me
[1:22:40] what it is oh it's just believing the
[1:22:43] Prophet was a prophet the devil beat you
[1:22:48] go start that see that's one thing folks
[1:22:53] I wish you'd be with me I don't play
[1:22:56] with you in games I say it like it is
[1:23:02] faith is a substance the substance isn't
[1:23:06] evidence now you go to court you walk in
[1:23:11] the courtroom and you say and they'll
[1:23:15] say what's the evidence they don't say
[1:23:20] what's your faith right what's the
[1:23:22] evidence well I got evidence that
[1:23:25] so-and-so stole this from me because I
[1:23:27] went to their house and found it and I
[1:23:29] got I got evidence here now and we lay
[1:23:31] all this out it's ok but now watch it
[1:23:36] can't be what somebody else says
[1:23:37] remember no man called Jesus Christ it
[1:23:40] can't be that you don't go into court
[1:23:41] with hearsay evidence I only seen one
[1:23:45] time they've done that our life a told
[1:23:47] judge we're sitting on that jury and
[1:23:49] they kept throwing up things and
[1:23:51] throwing up things and you know he's got
[1:23:53] a right to do it's right why levy said
[1:23:54] y'all hold it a minute he said there
[1:23:56] were one of these to do it said let's
[1:23:58] just have fun
[1:23:58] said the floors open bring up all the
[1:24:01] circumstantial evidences you want a
[1:24:03] brain they shed them every one up
[1:24:08] circumstantial evidence won't do in the
[1:24:09] court neither will it doing God's Word
[1:24:13] yours experience must match your
[1:24:16] evidence that you've got right the
[1:24:21] evidence you've got is your faith that
[1:24:24] you have that's been revealed to you
[1:24:27] that Jesus is the Christ if they've been
[1:24:34] revealed to Jesus graph you don't have
[1:24:36] an evidence you have what somebody else
[1:24:39] says
[1:24:43] you never hear say forget what I'm
[1:24:50] saying get what the Prophet is saying if
[1:24:54] you've got a substance you've got an
[1:24:56] evidence you've got an evidence you've
[1:24:58] got a substance something this real
[1:25:04] something that you're not afraid you're
[1:25:09] not afraid to tell somebody what you
[1:25:11] believe well I'll tell you what you just
[1:25:14] wouldn't understand
[1:25:15] you wouldn't understand my my my my my
[1:25:17] ways and end times so I ain't only
[1:25:20] really don't need me me trying to
[1:25:21] explain to you because you wouldn't
[1:25:22] understand me I've always told you my
[1:25:28] evidence and it's never been on
[1:25:36] experiences of something that's happened
[1:25:39] he's never been the dead raised he's
[1:25:42] never been the sick healed
[1:25:45] he's never been God appear into me he's
[1:25:49] never been an angel three times in my
[1:25:51] home I don't mind telling you it's never
[1:25:56] been none of that none of that is my
[1:26:00] evidence because Satan can impersonate
[1:26:04] every one of them but there's one thing
[1:26:08] the Prophet said he can't do he can't
[1:26:11] bring the word word by word he can't be
[1:26:16] the revealed word he thinks he is but he
[1:26:21] can't be so what is your substance how
[1:26:25] real is your God
[1:26:29] is he a real substance or a myth is he
[1:26:35] somebody you can talk to in contrary to
[1:26:40] the people of the message that he can
[1:26:41] talk back to you
[1:26:43] is that contrary to most people they
[1:26:48] don't talk it I put that out I'm blunt
[1:26:51] the word come to the Prophet we talked
[1:26:53] about that we're talking about a house
[1:26:56] blowed away and God said get out of it
[1:26:57] we're talking about gifts and callings
[1:27:00] we're going to get into that in the
[1:27:02] point where brother Randall covers that
[1:27:05] when you're baptized into the body
[1:27:06] you're baptized into gifts cool but he
[1:27:13] says now you can talk about Satan and
[1:27:17] impersonation he says you can't have a
[1:27:22] gift without having the Holy Ghost then
[1:27:26] he talked about impersonators I know you
[1:27:32] cannot have a real genuine gift from God
[1:27:38] that causes him now you got that in the
[1:27:43] right order you hold if you don't you
[1:27:44] gonna run away right faith is the
[1:27:47] substance of things over everything I
[1:27:51] have a hope for is in this Bible and the
[1:27:57] message that has been brought to us in
[1:28:00] that I have a hope of an eternal life in
[1:28:04] the land beyond the rivers what I call
[1:28:06] it I have a hope and a change of these
[1:28:09] bodies I have a hope in this world even
[1:28:12] coming to a redemptive plan to be washed
[1:28:15] off and used of God at least I've got a
[1:28:18] hope
[1:28:23] you know Abraham had a hope his with a
[1:28:26] substance that okay you won't get on
[1:28:28] that off
[1:28:28] Abraham's hope was a substance it NoHo
[1:28:31] he didn't hope against hope like what
[1:28:36] brother Richard Wilson said that time
[1:28:37] better he said our Abraham was taking
[1:28:40] that boy up there to offer and said just
[1:28:43] remember when he burning me to have a
[1:28:45] spoonful of ashes he burned it he burned
[1:28:52] me to that smoother life
[1:28:54] he said that was morning headstart Lee
[1:28:58] right to start with he only had faith
[1:29:02] then he had at least a spoon of Isis
[1:29:06] that's some real faith is the substance
[1:29:10] of things hoped for the evidence of not
[1:29:17] things that you can't explain to nobody
[1:29:20] else but it's within you let it random
[1:29:26] did you keep your salvation when your
[1:29:29] wife died and your daughter died he said
[1:29:32] no he said my salvation kept me he had a
[1:29:40] substance if you have the new birth
[1:29:46] today you have the substance of the
[1:29:48] gospel dwelling within you the substance
[1:29:53] of the gospel itself living in you come
[1:30:04] on musicians come on
[1:30:09] faith we're gonna get to that that's
[1:30:12] what I asked you to read statue of a
[1:30:13] perfect man and listen to him real
[1:30:15] careful where he says you have have
[1:30:19] faith and be born again I've got one
[1:30:31] let's see what I do with it
[1:30:32] oh yeah Macy's called perfect faith 1963
[1:30:40] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:30:44] by faith
[1:30:45] I mean substance of faith listen to him
[1:30:50] he is isolated from the entire world he
[1:30:56] said well that's only brother Branham
[1:30:57] and all you know the prophets or
[1:30:59] something let's read what he says he is
[1:31:03] isolated from the world and becomes a
[1:31:06] new creature in Christ when you become a
[1:31:10] new creature in Christ you have a
[1:31:12] substance faith you have the substance
[1:31:18] of the gospel dwelling within you which
[1:31:21] is a revelation of faith he's asked the
[1:31:24] lady for the entire world and becomes a
[1:31:26] new creature in Christ that now darn now
[1:31:29] you're getting into bride material
[1:31:33] see you're getting into rapturing
[1:31:37] condition now that means for each one of
[1:31:40] us not just a pastor the Deacons
[1:31:43] trustees that means for the laity every
[1:31:48] individual walks in a world with God
[1:31:50] alone every individual walks in the
[1:31:55] world with God alone you're baptized
[1:31:59] into the kingdom and there there's
[1:32:01] nobody in there but you and God he gives
[1:32:07] the others orders and you pack him out
[1:32:12] whatever he said there's not a shadow of
[1:32:15] doubt no order you walk right on if the
[1:32:19] Lord says that there's nobody in the
[1:32:20] world can take you out of it you go
[1:32:24] right on just the same talk you out of
[1:32:27] this Q now you're coming into perfect
[1:32:30] faith perfect perfection that cannot
[1:32:35] fail the faith never failed yes he was a
[1:32:38] Miss mystic to them with his perfect
[1:32:41] faith and so is it now with those who
[1:32:45] have perfect faith are a mystic to
[1:32:50] others perfect faith well brother you
[1:32:55] believe you have perfect faith I believe
[1:32:57] I'm born again if I'm born again that's
[1:33:00] perfect faith now not what I want what I
[1:33:05] need no but what I got is perfect faith
[1:33:10] if you have the new birth what you got
[1:33:12] is perfect faith just hold on to it
