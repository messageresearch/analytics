[0:00] - ringing tones and interpretation well
[0:03] you ain't got a nice fish against those
[0:05] hand got these in the cup he said that's
[0:07] the last to give have you ever thought
[0:09] about wisdom Fame when he said knowledge
[0:11] healing healing miracles prophecy
[0:14] they're sick so and then the other ones
[0:18] come in there with you you go over those
[0:21] say what if you don't have speaking it
[0:22] know that any in it if you don't have
[0:24] the nine spiritual guess working now now
[0:27] keep ready to quote up there brother
[0:28] I've said you'd have to give an account
[0:30] as a church if you didn't have a name
[0:49] that's what we have to keep if we come
[0:52] to church with those and we don't get
[0:54] all taken care of
[0:54] you don't have to go to the altar that's
[0:57] going to do it but if you care that
[1:02] thing that we just keep getting working
[1:05] keep getting worse the wraps that you
[1:08] leave either better or worse service why
[1:10] because that's what judgment starts in
[1:12] house of God preacher says something and
[1:14] you might be saying that we're going
[1:17] somebody over there maybe you come today
[1:20] alright ain't no time this time okay it
[1:23] ain't your day ain't no fifteen minutes
[1:25] okay just sleep over it and wake up the
[1:27] national gun that's correct
[1:40] that child are you hindered sometimes
[1:43] you go here come back that's why that we
[1:47] try to reverse the house to God as much
[1:49] as we can there is times when you have
[1:53] to speak but brother Brown said they you
[1:55] know they hey brother I need to meet you
[1:56] outside that don't mean you stand in the
[1:58] car diction have a comfortable
[1:59] conversation when you can go outside and
[2:01] have it all right and you have to still
[2:04] with a lot of people they'll stop more
[2:06] top of somebody's day outside
[2:08] I mean wait five minutes if you can't
[2:12] wait five minutes you need to turn go
[2:14] back to the altar we can't wait a minute
[2:16] you know go go back that way
[2:18] right but he keeps order because
[2:21] remember brother Brown said the Holy
[2:23] Ghost is a very timid person you got to
[2:26] always remember that because remember
[2:27] you can grieve the Holy Spirit
[2:29] remember grieve not the Holy three of
[2:31] the gun brother Brown said that the Holy
[2:32] Ghost was well on a limb and sit there
[2:34] and wait for you to repent that I don't
[2:36] mean that
[2:37] now listen they don't mean that that's
[2:39] just an illustration that don't mean
[2:40] that if this is your Holy Ghost he goes
[2:43] over yonder and set somewhere no he just
[2:45] didn't pay today is a learning day I'm
[2:50] not going to give you any revelation
[2:52] you're gonna feel the worst you've ever
[2:53] felt in your life but when you take care
[2:55] of what you've just done I'll come back
[2:57] coughing Tommy basically that's what it
[2:59] did cuz you know what the whole dose is
[3:00] the person so he talks to you
[3:03] all right it's not a ghost it just flows
[3:05] through there no you the person he can't
[3:07] well well right right well it's that's
[3:12] one of it he's not in our spirit realm
[3:14] because the sins we have as Christians
[3:16] are in the spirit realm it's not in the
[3:18] soul you can't see them brother Brown
[3:20] said you can't send enough to be lost if
[3:22] you're born again so that inside man is
[3:25] so I mean he solid well you know why
[3:29] it's solid cuz he got no lesser person
[3:32] he's God
[3:34] [Music]
[3:35] jerk when it comes down to it
[3:40] [Music]
[3:42] at the end of the service
[3:45] my brother salmon spinach but yeah the
[3:48] segment is going on and he's still
[3:50] saying things that's the one
[3:52] we will pop up and they've got
[3:55] yeah well you know to me that part of
[3:59] the service right there what they need
[4:08] but yet all of this commotion is going
[4:11] on in women is that certainly strong
[4:14] it's distracting yeah I agree but you
[4:19] know that is though it's got to be the
[4:21] devil does that say no it's not god I'm
[4:24] doing that so and you know here we go
[4:29] we're human beings we've listened to an
[4:30] hour hour and 15 minute sermon we went
[4:35] through 30 minutes of limitary and
[4:37] that's when somebody to go to the
[4:39] bathroom that when all that you know
[4:40] let's stand to our feet
[4:42] yeah when you stand up yeah the copy
[4:44] agenda but as a human being just
[4:48] realized that you know if God's in that
[4:50] service you're staying there for a few
[4:51] more minutes just think I'm going to
[4:53] jump off you know just stand there for a
[4:55] little while longer
[4:56] you say well I'm about to fan well just
[4:58] stand there for a minute if it's a god
[5:00] you won't have to worry about it
[5:02] I have been in service and I'll be
[5:04] honest I've been in service when I'm
[5:06] drinking let's talking up there in the
[5:07] front and I need to go bad so back under
[5:10] so bad and I have to walk so far and
[5:11] that's like you said hold it now there's
[5:14] a couple times like that but now you got
[5:16] it you gods in it though ever go away
[5:19] and you want even when you come
[5:20] downstairs you'll you'll finally eat
[5:22] your lunch and then you'll go outside
[5:23] you go two hours later
[5:27] so let's happen to me several times yeah
[5:29] so just trust in God but you know God
[5:32] can help us more than we want to be
[5:34] helped you say well that's kind of free
[5:37] kind of frivolous god help me you don't
[5:39] have to well you know what Lane nothing
[5:42] there's nothing in the scripture that
[5:44] says now they had a few things I'm not
[5:46] gonna help y'all with no he said I'm a
[5:48] guard to heals all your diseases and
[5:49] that is a disease that's all that went
[5:52] to go
[5:58] and he'll help you through but really
[6:03] I'll have that happen if you'll just
[6:05] hang on a little bit and if God's
[6:06] working in the service you'll forget
[6:08] about it
[6:08] you're really well and you'll just being
[6:10] you and your enter into the worship
[6:12] service a little bit more mm-hmm yeah by
[6:14] a new and living way which is
[6:16] consecrated for us through the veil that
[6:18] is to say his flesh and having a high
[6:20] priest over the house of God let us draw
[6:23] near with a true heart in full assurance
[6:25] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[6:27] from an evil conscience now our heart
[6:30] would you like I said that very center
[6:32] realm you cannot stand in that center
[6:34] realm if you are born again if not it's
[6:38] the seat of sin but then what's they
[6:41] does if he moves out into that outer
[6:43] realm memory reason conscious of it
[6:46] listen in fact if your memory doesn't
[6:48] bother you you're just not human you're
[6:53] on drugs yeah you're lying thank you now
[6:56] I can go say it but thank you thank you
[6:59] you're lying to yourself mainly memory
[7:03] reason conscious of face imagination now
[7:06] look I'm using those the soda SAT but
[7:09] now remember what brother Dale was
[7:11] trying to get us to see that if we don't
[7:14] free the journey of a Christian but
[7:16] through justification sanctification
[7:18] something truly justified you're already
[7:20] glorified in God's eyes not yours
[7:22] he knows what are you going to go on
[7:24] with the baptism there's a lot of people
[7:26] get justified because remember you don't
[7:30] get justified by being in a message
[7:32] Church you can be standing out on the
[7:34] street corner and the Bible says believe
[7:36] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
[7:38] be safe and that's what brother Tim was
[7:41] getting back on with his people trying
[7:43] to get him believe crying oh look he's
[7:45] even taking he had some pictures of
[7:47] brother Branham that was on the wall
[7:48] behind the pulpit don't fall down he
[7:51] said when I want people to raise their
[7:52] hands he said Oh
[7:53] see Christ I don't want to see another
[7:55] way so and we have to leave took it all
[7:58] that down and he's trying to get the
[8:00] people to get back the way and that's
[8:02] what brother Graham says you know I've
[8:04] getting them to Christ we're getting up
[8:06] to an idea and he was telling them
[8:08] because of the denomination well now
[8:10] here we are 2020 all motion and are we
[8:16] doing the same thing let's just fill up
[8:18] a message Church let's just make sure
[8:20] you don't wear dress company don't wear
[8:21] pants them mean you don't and you don't
[8:23] and you don't any you get on the cross
[8:30] thank them all back then we didn't get
[8:33] bench so Lily we'll start right here
[8:35] somewhere how about right there no force
[8:38] a clean they stand laying yourself
[8:39] together as the manner of some is and so
[8:48] much more as the day approaches okay I
[8:52] don't just like brother Dale if you need
[8:54] time to church morning you did when you
[8:56] started a born-again Bible you Tuesday
[9:02] morning in India verb
[9:05] that's where I start alright 950 let's
[9:18] go do it
[9:19] hi dildo well the law having a shadow of
[9:23] good things to come and not the very
[9:24] image of the Lincoln never we're gonna
[9:26] miss kind of we didn't get down too far
[9:28] sunny but we'll back up just a little
[9:31] bit and finish this chapter but the law
[9:33] having a shadow good things to come and
[9:35] not the very image of the thing so
[9:37] always remember the law was a shadow of
[9:41] good things to come but not the very
[9:43] image so you can't take in the Old
[9:45] Testament like we talked before you
[9:47] cannot take and tight everything in the
[9:51] Old Testament simply because David was a
[9:56] murderer in the Old Testament he was an
[10:00] adulterer first a murderer and he tried
[10:04] to cover it up so you know what if that
[10:06] was today he wouldn't be not just guilty
[10:09] a murder he'd been guilty of capital
[10:10] murder because he tried to cover it up
[10:13] right bad yes it wouldn't be good and
[10:17] then you take all the other people you
[10:19] take brother Keith Reed now we're
[10:20] talking about Abraham the father of our
[10:23] faith who Paul said strong in faith
[10:27] never weak that's not what's written in
[10:31] the Bible from getting away his wife
[10:35] twice even if you type that giving his
[10:38] wife away twice he gave her away as
[10:40] Abram and then he gave her away as
[10:42] Abraham okay so even in his journey as
[10:46] he progressed he was still human and he
[10:49] was under the law and there was nothing
[10:51] inside of him there was no there was no
[10:53] there was a moral accomplice but it
[10:56] wasn't God so much taking over and
[10:59] living the life the way
[11:00] with Abraham living his life now he
[11:02] lived close enough to God but I'm
[11:04] telling you you look at Abraham Abraham
[11:06] didn't just giggle in his heart like
[11:08] Sarah did when God told Abraham he was
[11:11] going to have the baby
[11:13] he got on the ground the Bible says with
[11:17] his face of the ground and lack now to
[11:19] me that would be way worse than Sarah
[11:21] giggling in her heart Sam huh I mean
[11:24] that pleasure with my husband a little
[11:25] more time with other words that's been
[11:26] 97 years old and brother after God would
[11:29] kill her for that if it hadn't been for
[11:31] every minute okay
[11:32] so these things we don't understand so
[11:35] they have a shadow then you go then you
[11:37] got a guy telling the Prophet to go
[11:38] marry prostitute then she leaves him
[11:41] comes back maybe they have more coming
[11:43] is that you can't type that in the Bible
[11:45] but God typed it to help Israel you got
[11:48] to remember God topped it to help Israel
[11:50] and then the type we take is we don't
[11:54] see the shadow anymore we don't take the
[11:56] shadow as gospel we take the very image
[11:59] of the things what when Christ come but
[12:03] we'll talk about a little bit today
[12:04] Christ is the Anointed Messiah all right
[12:08] he was not in the Old Testament in a
[12:10] person all of the earth everybody got
[12:14] that because now he is in a person on
[12:18] the earth and people called a bride
[12:20] there was an Old Testament bride but it
[12:23] what he had to put them away and we've
[12:26] covered that many many times so but it
[12:28] had a shadow of good things to come but
[12:30] not the very image of the things can
[12:32] never with those sacrifices which they
[12:34] offered year by year continually make
[12:36] the comers thereunto perfect I see you
[12:39] and I sure we have sins but we don't
[12:43] have sin okay we have sins we think
[12:48] things wrong we look at something maybe
[12:49] we shouldn't look I mean things are in
[12:51] front of us all the time we have to say
[12:53] God forgive me but now the things the
[12:55] back we don't go back to the bottom we
[12:57] back to them and we don't go back you
[12:59] know make your own laundry list whatever
[13:01] you smoking drinking gambling cousin
[13:03] running around all the things we'll see
[13:04] that's behind us because the perfections
[13:07] now inside of us because David I don't
[13:10] believe David with the new birth would
[13:12] have ever ever committed adultery with
[13:14] Bathsheba his his moral compass kind of
[13:18] got a little skewed when he in other
[13:20] words his his spirit realm took over to
[13:24] go get Bathsheba where God would control
[13:26] it more now I hope we don't have the
[13:28] problem with the baptism was all ago
[13:30] something one thing but he did have that
[13:32] problem and see that is an example of
[13:37] what God has done now in the New
[13:40] Testament he's come inside of us and
[13:42] it's not just a moral compass
[13:44] it's God living inside of us his his
[13:46] compass being lived up to us all right
[13:50] cook because that sacrifices didn't make
[13:54] them perfect that will come back last
[13:55] Sunday somebody comes up his ham I stole
[13:58] from my neighbor I want to offer this
[14:00] lamb will see that stealing nature was
[14:03] still in that guy he come back to next
[14:07] year he said oh I'm sorry I stole
[14:08] something else you know you just keep
[14:10] why because the sacrifice was just an
[14:12] offering to what to cover our to capo or
[14:17] cover what we're doing and even now we
[14:21] have that blood still on us for us and
[14:23] for us the little things we do as human
[14:26] beings but remember we better Bend of
[14:28] the throne we've entered boldly before
[14:30] the throne where they can't even go
[14:31] kicking down their door they make any
[14:33] touching
[14:41] come back from back-to-back-to-back for
[14:43] the same thing well they never never say
[14:46] it in the Bible because it even says
[14:48] here since Cain never with those
[14:49] sacrifices which they offered year by
[14:52] year so they offered them for the same
[14:53] thing year by year Mather comer they're
[14:57] into perfect Bela folks there's a lot of
[15:01] people that were thieves in the Old
[15:03] Testament that never did a sacrifice
[15:05] just like now there's people out here
[15:07] that are just rent center okay and there
[15:11] was people there not everybody in Israel
[15:13] walked up with a lamb just the ones that
[15:16] was trying to do better they were trying
[15:19] to live a good what we say Christian
[15:22] life they tried I'm reading it if you
[15:25] look I tell you what a healthy read
[15:27] first Chronicles and second it
[15:30] chronicles or writes down all the kings
[15:33] that were in Israel the ones that do
[15:35] good and once it did back the ones that
[15:38] did good God blessed that whole place
[15:40] the ones that did get bad dr. sacani
[15:42] told him he said as long as you keep me
[15:44] as your guide I'll bless you if you
[15:46] start going after these other gods
[15:48] you're gonna have trouble any would and
[15:50] I mean you see many times you looking
[15:52] Josiah was the king he was eight years
[15:54] old I know your own boy was a king but
[15:57] he did the right things and the eyes of
[15:59] God and when he turned 14 years old i
[16:01] Freedman yesterday when he turned 14
[16:03] years old he had they said it had never
[16:06] the Passover had never been celebrated
[16:12] like he celebrated it that one year I
[16:14] mean the whole of Israel based on five
[16:16] thousands upon thousands of animals and
[16:20] God blessed Joseph from 8 years old to
[16:22] 50 something years ago beerain 40
[16:24] something years and in Israel got killed
[16:26] in a battle but you have to remember you
[16:29] look at some of these has a cop
[16:31] different ones they'll start out good
[16:33] and then they'll turn to people or you
[16:35] know yeah just I'm saying journey with
[16:37] us right ain't God will bless those then
[16:40] what they keep God as their God okay
[16:46] but remember it's not Old Testament go
[16:50] back to them Ten Commandments or the you
[16:53] know doesn't don't because you got to
[16:56] get really real with some of this stuff
[16:57] but don't mean the Bible tells you don't
[16:59] wear wool with cotton you know all these
[17:02] things just and you know some of them
[17:04] are if some of them did Rome they shave
[17:06] their head or they would what they call
[17:09] it board their something they would call
[17:11] it they do something to do beer it's you
[17:13] yeah so I mean you know things like that
[17:15] you say well that's not it's still in
[17:18] the model but remember if we have an
[17:20] updated revelation that that that we
[17:24] don't have time to do them well the
[17:26] update of Revelation is we know that God
[17:28] down won't tell a prophet to go marry
[17:31] prostitute he won't tell you to go marry
[17:33] a prostitute he can't do that not with
[17:35] the blood of Jesus Christ being in you
[17:37] not just covering you alright so he's
[17:40] not going to tell you to go marry a
[17:42] prostitute but he told deliver that
[17:44] wasn't the back cut or somebody could
[17:47] Nick that was out there
[17:48] Hosea could go man prostitute now say
[17:51] that's totally against even the Old
[17:53] Testament but God told him to do it as
[17:56] an example right so in any battle it's
[17:59] not for us that free Israel that was not
[18:02] budge how did he change if you don't
[18:09] change but he's just not gonna tell
[18:12] anybody else to do it that way well in
[18:17] what you know he's never gonna tell
[18:19] someone else to do that okay he didn't
[18:23] change he didn't change he never told
[18:25] anybody else to do it that way again he
[18:28] just never said don't do it
[18:29] we just know not to do it he don't even
[18:32] say in the Old Testament don't marry
[18:34] prosecute you know what who was that
[18:39] Rosella brother Brown when I cross with
[18:44] you right here prostitute she married
[18:47] after she got converted she married and
[18:49] went out
[18:50] - fine so since you got married well
[18:54] brother Brown sure told she was a good
[18:56] Christian lady but stuff like that say
[18:59] about something yeah well you got
[19:11] listened you know that imagine divorce
[19:13] you gotta go back because if you called
[19:14] your wife commits adultery you're as
[19:17] guilty she is right we don't talk about
[19:19] that you know so and if you want those
[19:26] who commits adultery you're legally able
[19:28] to put her away marry again just like
[19:29] she did like today because you did you
[19:31] can't take them back you're not supposed
[19:32] to even a minister no ain't all that
[19:36] Minister go way out here
[19:38] wait on that yeah no no no no no we are
[19:43] uh we're a little bit different but God
[19:49] didn't change his mind we just don't do
[19:53] that no more when Christ came on earth
[19:54] he didn't say that I'm gonna do away
[19:57] with the Old Testament what did the
[19:58] Bible say he was born under the law to
[20:01] bring us out from under the law but he
[20:04] didn't destroy the law he magnified no
[20:08] where's he made it livable where we can
[20:09] live that and then he'll never ask
[20:13] another person that he wouldn't never
[20:15] ask another person to do that so
[20:18] therefore you don't change if he changed
[20:20] then he come back and said well you're
[20:22] not supposed to but listen Christ is
[20:23] living in us we're hearing from God
[20:26] inside of us okay I go I got a little
[20:31] bit on that later on the one man one do
[20:33] it's me for then would they not have
[20:36] ceased to be offered if it made a
[20:38] perfect one time they didn't need off
[20:40] from the more right because that the
[20:43] worshiper once purged or what done away
[20:45] with should have had no more conscience
[20:47] of sin now see now let's cover this just
[20:50] for a second because I want to cover
[20:51] this conscious memory reason conscious
[20:54] affects an imaginary
[20:55] that's your five realms in the middle
[20:58] and that's the whole problem now your
[21:01] conscience tells you of all the sin that
[21:02] you do and it ain't done okay
[21:07] but if your wife's purse you should have
[21:10] no more conscious of those things now
[21:12] when you main conscious sure we're
[21:14] conscious that where we did things wrong
[21:16] but we've got to come to a place that
[21:18] brother I don't say oh really you didn't
[21:20] do that the real you did not do those
[21:22] things that you did back then because
[21:25] Christ didn't do them and crisis in you
[21:27] now so he didn't do it
[21:29] therefore when we got to come to the
[21:32] place that we see this thing doesn't sin
[21:33] we stand in our consciousness knocked
[21:36] our body our body just revealed what our
[21:39] conscious was thinking okay and they
[21:42] didn't have a moral accomplished I mean
[21:43] they had a moral compass but not a guide
[21:45] that was close enough to say don't do
[21:48] that enough cuz remember he told him not
[21:50] to do those things he said no no but
[21:53] they wouldn't do them anyway and you
[21:55] know what they're gonna there's a lot of
[21:56] them gonna be in heaven not as bright
[21:59] but they're gonna be in heaven as Old
[22:01] Testament Saints goes remember they
[22:03] musta went to paradise so that's where
[22:05] all the Old Testament Saints went that
[22:07] works what we today Christians in the
[22:10] Old Testament because when Jesus died he
[22:12] went to paradise program didn't picked
[22:14] up the Saints that were in fair enough
[22:15] so there must have been a bunch so that
[22:18] was just a few there's a lot of people
[22:21] that's gonna be remembered oh that's
[22:24] imparted eternal life that's not eternal
[22:26] life while they were here if I got that
[22:29] right there was no way God could enter
[22:32] in a soul under the sacrifice and
[22:35] offerings didn't do that but remember
[22:37] we're gonna finish this maybe today but
[22:40] then when they would have ceased to be
[22:41] offered because it works who wants
[22:43] virtue there's no more conscious thing
[22:44] but in those sacrifices were remembered
[22:46] every year at the time of the Day of
[22:49] Atonement
[22:50] all Israel knew that because they were
[22:53] depending on that one priest to go in
[22:55] there and cover the sins of his
[22:58] for that year but they had to go back to
[22:59] next year then you have to go back the
[23:01] next year right remember something every
[23:04] year where it is not possible from here
[23:07] just here's your your Paul has given us
[23:10] right here where it is not possible that
[23:13] the blood of bulls and of goats should
[23:14] take away sin so they just continually
[23:17] have their sandwich okay in the Old
[23:19] Testament where for when he cometh into
[23:22] the world he says sacrifice and
[23:24] offerings that would it's not in other
[23:26] words did not desire because remember
[23:35] God really was thing about this other
[23:39] thing God knew the end from the
[23:41] beginning he knew how all this he knew
[23:43] what was gonna come about the day he
[23:44] knew who was gonna fall away he knew was
[23:46] gonna come in he knew all this to the
[23:47] very beginning but I think still when
[23:49] you do something right I think he's like
[23:52] that's my boy
[23:54] that's my girl even though he knew you
[23:56] were gonna do it before the foundation
[23:58] of the world yeah you come to the place
[24:00] you do it here and you go and then
[24:01] sometimes they'll come to remember what
[24:03] brother Brown said brother I've said the
[24:04] Holy Spirit would go back to God not to
[24:06] people but it's it's that mediator that
[24:09] position the Holy Ghost goes back said
[24:11] boy you sons acting good are your son's
[24:13] acting bad so so we still have these
[24:16] things on ice I thought well you know
[24:19] what brought the thought it was is that
[24:22] if I knew every move I made from now
[24:26] till the body change it probably scare
[24:31] me to death number one here you turn
[24:33] that tail but if we knew we were going
[24:37] to the body change and we saw herself
[24:38] with the body change we'd be so lakhs of
[24:40] days ago we'd be stuff we just be human
[24:43] let's see God let us live our day to day
[24:45] life not really knowing a lot what's
[24:48] going on ahead of time but giving us
[24:51] morning
[24:51] showing us things in the Bible and then
[24:53] to me that's the journey me and brother
[24:55] Keith was talking about that you gotta
[24:56] have a journey because the Bible says
[24:58] those who is justified he's already
[25:00] glorified if you justified today truly
[25:02] justified and went to the new birth then
[25:05] you're already horrified but you're
[25:08] still gonna live that life
[25:10] that's the journey of justification is
[25:14] that petition baptism okay therefore
[25:16] when he comes to the world says
[25:17] sacrifice and offerings down wouldest
[25:19] not know words he didn't want that to
[25:21] happen he knew it was going to happen
[25:22] but he don't want that to happen he
[25:24] wanted us to all come just like Adam but
[25:27] you know what that would have took away
[25:28] a lot of things a lot of attributes of
[25:30] dying listen folks this is the way God
[25:32] saw it or ain't done no surprises this
[25:37] is the whole plan brother Graham said he
[25:39] had a plan and the purpose in Christ
[25:40] inventions are revealed
[25:41] God had a plan and a purpose and he was
[25:43] going to see the chief mean you don't
[25:44] leave him home please see our plans
[25:46] already we're happy when we do but most
[25:50] of our plans from the beginning to the
[25:52] end is written in pencil you know but
[25:58] here's your drinking blood and then
[25:59] don't change amen so we just depend on
[26:02] him but the body has now prepared me
[26:05] that's what he's always wanting God has
[26:07] always wanted children in human flesh to
[26:10] live with him you know why cuz that's
[26:13] how he started his first man his first
[26:16] family with Adam and Eve in the Garden
[26:18] of Eden and that's what we're going back
[26:21] to when he had to come as a body yet
[26:24] becomes a body a human body to be the
[26:29] sacrifice right come from ever and I'll
[26:33] give you this not next honey but the
[26:35] next honey I want to back up to that
[26:37] want to bring me something out of Isaiah
[26:39] 53 where the Bible says he gave he gave
[26:42] his soul an offering for sin offering
[26:46] here at some his self he gave his soul
[26:49] or ransom
[26:50] did say anything about the body he gave
[26:52] his soul Lorenza
[26:54] they'll see his body's not what came
[26:55] back into you at the new birth it was
[26:57] his salt but he did have a body a body
[27:00] has that one prepared me now you can
[27:02] take that as dual meaning because who is
[27:06] his body today we are a body since acts
[27:10] 2:38 the body hast thou prepared me what
[27:13] we're preparing this body for God
[27:15] because we're the only body on the earth
[27:17] if you'll ever have until he comes back
[27:20] with us in the Millennium this is the
[27:22] only body they hit that he's gonna have
[27:23] this is the body of Christ can you touch
[27:25] the body
[27:31] [Music]
[27:35] the body of the soundhole used in the
[27:37] very wide application literally or
[27:42] figuratively see that body is a figure a
[27:45] body both of men and animals identified
[27:47] here court with him on that the living
[27:49] body of animals the body planets body
[27:51] stars through it
[27:58] mystical body how many times brother
[28:00] Graham looked at word of the ethical
[28:02] program calls us the mystical body of
[28:04] Christ wrote in the New Testament of the
[28:06] church so Strong's had enough of us had
[28:11] enough for me from a from his revelation
[28:15] to know that that body just didn't mean
[28:17] Jesus's natural body it's his natural
[28:20] body had to come but he was building
[28:21] another body on the day of Pentecost
[28:23] excuse me called a bride in burnt
[28:26] offerings and sacrifices for sin that
[28:28] was had no pleasure then said hello I
[28:31] come watch interpolating because
[28:36] remember take that out and all he would
[28:38] say it low
[28:39] they said lo I come to do thy will O God
[28:41] go that is the scripture back in the Old
[28:43] Testament but Paul interpolation tells
[28:46] you where it's coming from in the volume
[28:48] of the book it is written of me what
[28:50] book the Bible the Torah whatever you
[28:53] want to say brother Brown said that the
[28:57] Jews thought they got got in letter for
[28:58] I mean they got the Book of Ruth but
[29:00] they got God in letter form that's why I
[29:03] said today then since it but today you
[29:05] got to remember today is not the written
[29:07] word that written were to kill you as
[29:11] long as it stays there but if that comes
[29:14] in here okay then makes a big difference
[29:20] okay conditional condemn you always but
[29:24] if you become the word we've become the
[29:26] workers we received the word we don't
[29:28] become typewritten letters right no no
[29:32] if there was a big top Ryder no he just
[29:34] told you what he wanted to live in a
[29:37] Bonnie
[29:38] [Music]
[29:41] but a bunny you want to live in a human
[29:45] body
[29:46] the Bible has become flesh and when we
[29:54] see that more and more we will take a
[29:56] body change because that's where your
[29:57] body changes it's in this portrait in
[30:00] this word right here where your body
[30:02] changes right so this is the word made
[30:04] flesh
[30:06] [Music]
[30:09] yeah that's not life
[30:11] now that inside of you is love but
[30:14] that's not a lot of work that's well
[30:17] that's I tell you what it is that's
[30:19] that's a man compiling words but God
[30:24] giving the thought that can put them in
[30:26] there but God's got to reveal this cuz
[30:28] remember every time a small church this
[30:33] day it's probably reading a body Donna
[30:35] has prepared me where the bride of Jesus
[30:37] Christ but remember God's not didn't
[30:40] love church today okay
[30:42] he's an individual but he's not in that
[30:43] church system anymore let me put it that
[30:45] way
[30:45] God's not add a church system okay he is
[30:49] not in the badness system then he can be
[30:51] in the people but else preaching that
[30:53] would mean brother we went to vote in
[30:57] him and we stayed over Wednesday night
[30:59] the brother Brown
[31:06] said we're not getting people to Christ
[31:08] we're getting them to what we've just
[31:10] been getting them for 50 years we've
[31:12] been getting them to books and tapes and
[31:16] up and you look what brother they'll
[31:18] freeze and he's going around buying
[31:19] freaks and simple salvation why because
[31:21] if you're not born again that is just
[31:23] this is just words in dudes and don't
[31:25] this is no more than a tent no let me
[31:26] say something about that this is the 10
[31:29] commandments to the bride just like he
[31:31] killed is rule that's gonna kill us I'm
[31:33] talking about the books in the tape okay
[31:35] we've dealt with hand grass and all that
[31:38] stuff for 50 something years but that's
[31:39] not what this message is about this
[31:42] message is Christ and when you get
[31:44] people to Christ and you get a
[31:45] born-again the right way I'm glad other
[31:47] preachers are seeing it besides us real
[31:50] and wrote III blue piece of it is is one
[31:53] of the most guilt off subject still six
[31:55] years after brother brown made a quote
[31:57] in lasting 59 that we're not the new
[32:02] birth is one of the most deal taught
[32:03] subject we've heard sermon after sermon
[32:08] don't you believe the message can we
[32:10] believe the message do you cut your hair
[32:11] no do you wear pants no well you must be
[32:14] born again
[32:14] well now that's a lot right that's a lot
[32:17] and you know we're last come from God
[32:22] hey the Prophet thank
[32:24] comes from the devil himself he is a
[32:27] liar and if he tells you something
[32:30] contrary the word it's a lot of did come
[32:31] from God alright I've come to do that
[32:35] well in the volume of the book is
[32:36] written now see we have to get it out of
[32:38] the Bible
[32:38] don't get me wrong don't throw the
[32:40] bottle away don't throw books away
[32:42] we have to get it out of there but if
[32:46] it's just a cloak that's why we've been
[32:51] here this long
[32:52] above when he said sacrifice and offered
[32:55] to burn opened an office in that what is
[32:56] none neither hash pleasure there in
[32:59] which are offered by the law so you have
[33:01] no pleasure in that he didn't want to
[33:03] see all those animals died because of
[33:05] the sin of man but you don't want that's
[33:06] the way it came to that the way he
[33:08] accepted that sacrifice point but
[33:10] remember we're coming down to the place
[33:12] where he accept one sacrifice he gave
[33:16] itself he gave his soul a ransom so he
[33:19] could see a sea which is you and I right
[33:23] because the body was a sacrifice the
[33:27] soul is what Satan was looking at and
[33:29] say it wanted that soul he wants your
[33:31] soul right by which will I'm sorry this
[33:36] study though I come to do that little
[33:37] guy he taketh away the first now
[33:40] remember he didn't take it away and all
[33:42] right we don't read Old Testament no
[33:43] it's nobody said because we remember
[33:46] Paul didn't have a New Testament he was
[33:48] writing it so he was looking back in the
[33:51] Old Testament and got all this new
[33:54] revelation and the haircut he said look
[33:57] he taketh away the first what sacrifice
[34:00] and offering that he may establish
[34:02] decided which is who himself Christ by
[34:06] the which will we are sanctified through
[34:09] the offering of the body of Christ once
[34:11] for all
[34:11] all right does not have to get up on the
[34:14] cross again and die every time we need
[34:16] something but now remember to do brother
[34:19] rhythm preach the indictment he indicted
[34:22] this generation for the second
[34:25] crucifixion of Christ
[34:26] going back to Matthew 17 where he'd come
[34:30] off the mountain he said television of
[34:32] no one till the Son of Man be risen
[34:33] again they killed the son of man put him
[34:36] on cross and he killed him again to the
[34:38] denomination like this he's to be
[34:40] resurrected beginning me and you amen
[34:43] all right the Son of Man which is what
[34:46] God in human flesh and that's what we
[34:48] are now working
[34:49] you play and every priest stands daily
[34:53] ministering offering oftentimes the same
[34:55] sacrifices which can never take away
[34:58] sins but this man after he had offered
[35:00] one sacrifice for sins forever sat down
[35:03] on the right hand with God from went
[35:05] forth expecting until his enemies be
[35:10] made as let's do now how is he doing
[35:12] that through a bride remember you have
[35:17] to have a foot put on the stoop for it
[35:20] to be a foot stood and the only foot
[35:22] he's got down here is us alright so
[35:28] there's a body sticking with the speed
[35:30] on the footstool so it's the body of
[35:31] Christ that's here on the earth today
[35:33] comes remember and the enemies will be
[35:36] made as footstool and remember Paul said
[35:38] the last enemy to be destroyed is what
[35:40] dad alright so now you and I have a
[35:46] scripture that says we which are alive
[35:48] and remain we're gonna read it again
[35:50] this afternoon that's specific to me and
[35:53] you that's our scripture but we're not
[35:55] leaving up next on this is our scripture
[35:57] to use usually instumental we what
[36:00] you're allowing their length for by one
[36:05] offering if perfected forever them
[36:09] dinner sanctified usual I still have
[36:14] problem well you the one that happened
[36:17] not good you doing this guy not him but
[36:22] he just told you right here when we
[36:24] gonna start believing the Bible by one
[36:26] offering he has perfected forever them
[36:32] all right scuse me
[36:33] we're of the Holy Ghost also is a
[36:36] witness to us for after that he has said
[36:40] before this is the Covenant that I will
[36:41] make with them after those days says the
[36:44] Lord as he wrote this this is an Old
[36:46] Testament Paul quotes the Old Testament
[36:48] if you got Scofield Bible you can run
[36:51] your references every time Paul says
[36:53] something like that it'll reference back
[36:54] he's actually quoting the Old Testament
[36:57] just like brother Branham come Paul here
[37:00] comes as a prophet in the first days
[37:01] quoting the Old Testament most of this
[37:04] sermon is the Old Testament don't even
[37:06] got a New Testament then you got another
[37:07] ground come on the earth and most of the
[37:09] time even in during his preaching he's
[37:11] quote scripture about 90% of the time
[37:15] he's quoting scripture not verbatim but
[37:17] he's weaving in English into a sermon
[37:19] alright because you can't get anything
[37:21] outside of the Bible that's what our
[37:23] problem is everybody thinks like we were
[37:25] talking about the Seventh Seal everybody
[37:27] thinks it's this and that and did so
[37:28] younger than him coming back in the tent
[37:30] and go ride a horse you got killed there
[37:32] and got to do this and to do that that's
[37:34] the Seventh Seal
[37:35] that's what the Bible said okay and then
[37:39] brother realm is said revealing Christ
[37:41] so where's Christ will reiterate that
[37:45] this afternoon this is the comment that
[37:47] I'll make with them after those days
[37:49] saith the Lord I will put my laws into
[37:51] their hearts
[37:52] remember Ezekiel I'll give you a new
[37:54] heart and in their minds will I write
[37:57] them and their sins and iniquities will
[38:01] I remember no I say believe it's done
[38:06] this you got to believe that now we're a
[38:10] remission of this is there's no more
[38:12] offering percent
[38:13] be baptized for the remission
[38:17] having therefore brethren boldness to
[38:20] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[38:23] Jesus by a new and living way see the
[38:26] common man couldn't approach God in the
[38:28] Old Testament he had to go to the priest
[38:30] and then the priest when did the
[38:31] offering not now you can as brother
[38:34] Keith was preaching here any person I
[38:37] think pretty much is brother brother
[38:38] Tim's dick then we all have gifts in the
[38:41] body not spiritual gift doesn't just
[38:43] work in the Paco memory you've got a
[38:45] knife here you've got not spiritual gift
[38:47] ok what is them your sisters gonna have
[38:50] wisdom wisdom prophecy all these
[38:54] different things you can have they send
[38:56] the body it's not just in five whole
[38:57] minutes I send the whole body but yet
[39:06] all that they send the body not just in
[39:08] five whole ministry what what everybody
[39:10] pretty much is blade pretty much on the
[39:12] ministry to do that no well we it's like

[39:25] Hampton we made her online well a minor
[39:27] or the life
