========================================

good morning good morning thankful to the Lord to be here again today we want to wish our mothers Happy Mother's Day May the God bless you and give you strength I um often to thank my mother to you know and mothers have ways of doing things that we just don't understand how they do them and why they do them but they're special and uh when other people doubt you mother still love you and have confidence in you and uh so never give up so I think you know they said if a child is a mass murderer head to the gas chamber the mother still that loving him when others don't so you know we just love all of you too amen we're going to read this morning from Psalm 23 just sure this morning I stopped in McDonald's to get a little breakfast and had a little girl there I must have been a first customer when I tried to order because I didn't know it was on the menu strictly she had a hard time trying to order just something that's not a number one or number two she couldn't put the get the coffee right or nothing but you know I said just just remember to to pray for her that she'll get over that nervous condition that she had and be able to keep a job that's right amen let's pray Heavenly Father we are grateful God for this food that we are going to receive this morning low rest that you would bless it that's right that it was strengthened and nourish our bodies love we know there's many things and many needs that we have in this life God but you're willing to give them all unto us Lord we will yield ourselves to your holy word Lord and understand and accept it God this day as we walk let us walk hand in hand with you Lord interesting and believing all of your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen psalm 23. the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake thou prepareth the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointeth my head with all my cup runneth over surely in goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen God bless you Open the Eyes my heart why I will say you yes Open the Eyes pour out your power and love as we sing amen shining in the light of your glory or out your power and love as we sing thank you yes you're holy holy holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen I want to honest don't you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Ephesians 1 and Ephesians 2 will try to continue on where we were this past Wednesday and I would invite all of you the ones especially who did not hear the message Wednesday I would ask that you would listen to it I think it would be very helpful and very valuable to understand uh where we're at and what we're doing and I just ask you to if you would to listen to it that way we'll try to review a higher this morning but we won't put too much in now we know for Surety today is Mother's Day and we always honor all of the mothers and potential mothers and that's why that we have a point of saying uh you know that we were going to give a little gift today to all of the marriage sisters and the mothers now the reason we're saying it that way because a married sister no matter where you are if you're 90 years old you're a potential mother uh Abraham and Sarah okay all right so we're not saying well this one can't and that one can't because it don't but you know I still believe in God can do miracles all right so we have a little gift for you we always take all of the brothers or or we don't pay all expenses but we you know we kind of handle expenses to allow the brothers to go on a Father's Day and we don't lay that down as fathers only you know we we say to all of the men of the church that they're welcome to come and be with us and we have a good time fishing together and fellowshipping together for two or three days there so you know we want to do this for the for the uh Sisters of the church all right and we thank each one of you let's give our all of the mothers a good hand all right and the potential mothers because they are wonderful things as the old Feller said if there wasn't no Mudders it wouldn't be no fodders so that's That's the basis of it I've I've always taught you and believed it Abraham was I mean Adam was capable of a lot of things but you know that Adam couldn't bring four children without Eve and I honestly believed that he would not have brought him forth in a spoken creation I'm honest because if it was in our you know and I don't mean that wrong it could have been anything I mean he I believe he would have spoke him into existence but he's going to speak them through Eve I believe that I believe that Eve would have been the mother but it wound up being the wrong mother right but we appreciate all of the true mothers all right here on Mother's Day we have a little thank you note from from Brother Hank and sister Martha black they say thanks everyone of this church for caring for me and my wife and thank you very much we love you amen so we appreciate that all right we're going to try to take up as I said where we left off Wednesday so we'll read Ephesians all right remember now this coming weekend is the fellowship meeting you know to to be here to church and so we pray that you would get everything ready together for it and and all of the cookings and the doings and have everything right and then we'll have a good time in the Lord Brother Douglas is going to be with us preaching brother Ernie could not brother villain Nueva could not come and be with us because of his problems with his feet so we remember him and keep him in your prayers that the Lord would bless him all right so remember that Ephesians 1 and Ephesians 2. Lord Jesus we thank you for all things and we Praise Your Great Name we just ask you Lord that you would just be with each and every one of us and bless in God that your love may be made manifest through each one of us we love you and we thank you and we commit everything into your hands believing that you will honor your word because you put it there for us and we read it and we lord all we have to do is remind you of what you say it and Lord what a wonderful thing it is to have a father that would care for each and every one of us we love you and we commit everything into your hands now in Jesus name amen we'll read from Ephesians 1. 15. run so much off in the back Ephesians 1 and Ephesians 2. we'll get up in a minute but we'll read the scripture there we go now listen to what the Apostle Paul has to say wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand or in Heavenly places far above all principalities and powers and might and Dominion in every name his name not only in the world but also in that which is to come Ephesians 2. now remember that's him he was raised up to Heavenly places all right now then watch what he does to us on Ephesians 2 and verse 5. even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by Grace you're saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try to just pick up because I kind of got the Lord kind of changed things that are Wednesday and I kind of went into a little different way to express you know what was on my heart and I pray that you enjoyed that and as I said I would like for you if you would to go back and view that for a moment you know sometimes when you get a chance because I was trying to explain to me you know I I gave the illustration like Paul we'll read it in a little bit said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout Morse of an archangel and a trumpet all right that's been a mystery that man has made it this way and he's made it that way and he's made it this way and he's made a holler out of it or made a great big Angel descending out and it's happening or a great big to do to do trumpet and uh all of those things and trying to figure out what is meant but I asked a question and made the thought see if you come over to where brother Brandon was at and brother Brandon would say you know what Paul said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout before someone Archangel trumpet and you said Paul what do you mean he said I meant the Lord and would descend from heaven with a shout right because that's what Paul was saying all right well what was he really saying it bringing it down to the prophet he said that Jesus does all three of these things in his descending we'll get more on that this afternoon maybe but see the point was that Paul saw it you remember Wednesday I was trying to explain when a prophet says something when Paul saw that he said in other words he was looking at it and to him he could see it my spiritual Revelation and he'll said with Jesus the Lord you know whatever Jesus Will descend from heaven with a shout divorce of an archangels or trumpet that's what Paul was saying brother random put it in human terminologies for us to just say that Jesus done all three of those things in his descending all right now we'll get back as I said I want to try to bring this thought in but we'll get back more this afternoon on the point of thinking about that remember if Jesus does all three and he's descending well that's coming here we've always looked at Rapture is going there right see we look at going up that way the Bible looks at coming this way so that's the mass confusion right in other words we're we're the ones that are wrong why couldn't we read when it says you know in other words why didn't we read the Bible because I know we wouldn't prophets we're not prophets that's the reason we didn't read it that way but brother Brandon when he read it he says Jesus does all three of these in his descending you know what that's simple to him but you know what when Paul said it he saw it like I said about Naaman seeing charius Johnson in the streets he saw Cadillacs and Buicks and things running into each other on the highways and with lightning with headlights on we didn't know how to describe that so when he spoke it it automatically became sealed to the unbeliever right but you know what and Iman saw it I believe Paul saw the Lord Jesus Christ descending from heaven with a shout and abortion were knocking on trumpet but you know what once he spoke it he was the only one there that knew what that was right right and once he spoke it it automatically became a prophecy a prophecy is speaking of a future event or things are doing what do you follow what I mean see then when brother Branham came along and him being the prophet God could tell him what that was so he said Jesus does all three of these in his descending you know what he saw it I believe the prophet of this end time saw the end of all the Rapture etc etc I believe he saw that all right but you know as quick as he said it it became a human uh knowledge to you and I that Paul was actually saying that it would not be until the end time then it would be that Jesus would descend from heaven with a shout the voice of Archangel trumpet all right you know what it became as quick as the prophet spoke it a prophecy because nobody didn't know what he was saying right oh but I read that I was sitting there when he said that okay I'm not going to argue with you I'm just gonna leave it in your lap but I'm going to give you an illustration then I'll get onto the message have you ever read the message the Bible and think and you see something so clear right it is so clear to you I mean you want everybody to see it right and you run over to somebody yeah and you start to tell them and oh you know what because once you speak it it's a prophecy when you've seen it it was reality right you remember the little boy that that said that time were about you know that you sitting there and he's telling someone he said well then I I know something nobody knows it but Daddy and me he said me and Daddy's all the one that knows this a little bit actually what's the matter he said now Daddy's the only one that knows it because he'd forgot all right see once brother random spoke this message if you understand what I'm getting at yes it automatically is sealed up no brother damn it was unveiled in our day oh how carnal we read the Bible when it said the Lord confess to understand from heaven with a shout and we had to to do to do and the horns blowing and the sound into this and to do another that and some great big something happened in the sky and an archangel come down and we don't want to talk about them days do we right we don't want to talk about them days now do we see once this message is revealed it's no longer a prophecy I've tried to preach that for 40 something years when this message is revealed it's no longer prophecy but it's only revealed to an individual it's not revealed to a group of people we're not Jews we're not dealing with that but even to the Jews when they come in it'll still come as individuals that will make up to 144 000. you see the prophet said it that's a revelation the Bible said it the Bible never said baptized father son Holy Ghost that's how carnal you are Matthew 28 19 says Lord Jesus Christ right so I know we go oh forget my theatrical expressions and get the point we had the Bible but it was only a prophecy that's right once this Prophet began to expound upon it the only thing we have right now I don't care how long you've been in the message I don't care if your family you know what I mean by that the kids are the prophet the wife of the Prophet the thing the daughters it's got to be revealed amen if it ain't revealed it's only words right but once it's revealed that a random said you want him as long as it's laying on the pages of this book it can be questioned he said but said once it's revealed it can't be questioned you mean somebody could talk you out of water baptism now you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know when you followed 40 years and then somebody talk you out and show you it was really supposed to be father son Holy Ghost yeah and our Revelation to start with come on they can't deprogram somebody in the message that's what tickles me they'll take people in the message and deprogram them with a trinity now boy that's something man um I'll get off of that okay but just remember I think you agree with one point I just made you try to explain something to somebody that is so beautifully marvelously revealed to you and then when you start to try to explain that it's just like it's gone why your words is making it a prophecy according to page 45 I believe it is Christ the mystery God revealed right around and said the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word couldn't reveal the word he could only speak upon the things until the Holy Ghost could speak back to you and I and that's the only thing anybody can do all right are you following me amen see once you speak it once the prophet spoke it it was sealed up you know you want a scripture for that according to over the Book of Daniel that said seal up the things that have been spoken you know they had been spoken you know that brother random said Daniel heard the Thunder come on come on he said Daniel heard the Thunders but he was told to seal it up right how did he seal it up by writing it come on be sensible once he pinned it he could not put it to her what was in his mind then it takes the same one it wrote it to be in there to interpret it to you and I all right that's what I was trying to get out Wednesday night but listen think about it now we read from Paul and we tried to cover a little our Wednesday and then we'll take up right here and Paul said to the Ephesians that Jesus Christ was raised up to the right hand of the father right and that he was sitting right says to you and I the next chapter second chapter that by the new birth now not just because we hear it and but by the new birth when you're born again that raises you out of natural carnality into the spiritual revelation and when you're born again you are sitting in Heavenly places and what did the prophet say the Heavenly places was Christ of Mr God revealed he said the believer's position in Christ you know you've got a position the day you was born again you got a position well I don't know my position what what are you supposed to be I mean you women know you're not supposed to preach so it takes that position out which you do know you can testify that puts that position in you do know you have a family to preach to your kids right but you know what silliness we are see we're so silly and so uh great Revelations that we have until we'll say now no woman ain't supposed to teach a boy when the boy gets to be about 12 30 and they don't here we don't allow that we believe that a woman's not supposed to teach the kids you know but you're going to say that she's not supposed to teach her family now you've gone into dumb stupidity just because that kid is 30 years old you mean mama can't tell him something but don't put her over the teaching the class we know the order well everyone says you sisters has got your pulpit it's your family and you know that's what gets to a problem with the people of the message then the man's wife will try to tell the husband something in the head of this house you can't tell me nothing well that's true you can't tell them nobody can it's kind of odd one time in a situation with sister meedy that she would wind up with a growth because of saying something but in other situations when she would correct him like he was saying ain't nothing but three great men you know one year now that one out of Kentucky and she says bill that's not right well you know what she didn't get a growth out of that one you see what I mean we got it all figured out boy we got oh man we yeah I got the quote what is the believer's position but around it's his position in Christ all right amen now we get in that position and we're in Heavenly places and you know what the day you got born again that Soul entered into an eternal state right by the new birth now does it come back out and you ain't in Heavenly places no no no no no no no there's something wrong with your thinking I didn't know eternal life come in and out but I do admit that a lot of times physically we're not in spiritual we're not in the Heavenly places don't you huh people who say the Lord told me to say that it might be true and if it is true you're all right but if it ain't true you're wrong all right but think about it the believer's position now this was the point I wanted to get across because we about page 15 of the church age book let's see if we can find it go ahead I believe it's number four let me just read this I believe it's right now going down to go to number nine I've got so many notes on the point you know but on here you him brother Brown was talking about one thing that I want to get to in a minute for certain he says we're living away below our privileges living below our privileges running that on your computer sometimes to see how many times he said that that we live below our privileges but you know what he says we do he said we were losing our inheritance excuse me brother and I'm sorry pull back up number four let's just read it I try to get ahead and everything and I lose and then so they'll get it I mean pull number four up which you hear you him E43 hell no that's uh number six come on I'm looking down at my notes and I've got them number six well go get it don't worry about it don't nobody leave I'll get my mind back together right a while okay well look what he did and I think that's just where our churches are getting we're children of God but we're losing our inheritance by our conduct the things that we do and the things that we permit to be done and the way that we live and act and so forth all right now that's easy to understand that part that's us and that's our conducts and our ways and our manners of doing that's making us live below our privileges right but the rest of it is what I want you to read we're living millions of miles below our privilege now watch and then someone can see the work of God being done and Dr so and so Dr Jones says it's it's this and the other doctor says it's this and we believe it instead of looking into the word now could I paraphrase that just a little bit you know may I remember a vision that brother Branham had and he had a vision of a woman that he saw and a man standing there with a three-cornered stick and said every time that woman would raise up you remember he'd hit her with that three-quartered stick well while he got upset and he told him he said now you gotta do that again and it went away he said then the interpretation came that the church as it would try to raise up he said then that Trinity comes along and knocks him back down yep well you know see we think about well brother Dale I ain't never heard nobody talk about your Trinity my preacher Don't Preach the Trinity what are you talking about if he preaches anything contrary to Hebrews 13 18 he's preaching the trinity even if he's preaching Oneness Oneness just goes over the other way and it's still trinitarianism come on but you see what happens to you and I we start trying to raise up I've watched that for 40 something years I preached it for 40 something years to try to get you to see something and I'd see it start rising up and a few start catching on to what I was doing and what I was trying to preach and then all at once I see the devil come in and flop and try to take it away well you know they don't have to say a lot you say well that might be right in a way now he's either Hebrews 13 later he's not brother Reynolds said now that's he said it's not in a way he said the mule is the one that says is in a way so now you want to listen to The Mule we had a brother come here one time years ago that he saw the pillar of fire up here at the front you remember the story and he saw that Pillar of Fire and I believe he did but then after a while you know it was okay because we're seeing the pillar of fire everybody's kind of well a filler of fire we send a pillar of fire you know and then one day he saw it again and he said it come off the platform and went out in the congregation so this one brother he had the great idea he said we need to put the purify to come back into the building called us leaving out I get up here right here and told him I said I don't agree with him you remember it's on tape I said because the pillar of fire up here to me is one thing but that ain't gonna do you no good I said I believe the purifier left here because I wanted to leave here you know what I mean I don't want to go away from me I wanted to go out back where you're at of course did they change the brother's thoughts no no you still talk to Bill if I went out the door well some of you you know sympathize with that and you thought it went out the door do you understand what I'm getting at you understand what the prophet's saying Dr Jones Dr so-and-so doctor or this that or the other since well maybe in a way the biggest hindrance we have is the preachers in this message I've said that 40 something years ago and I don't back off today who's the ones that stirring up all the stuff what is that catch the believe the sign go home run any computer find out how many is turned against the message now preachers they said there's one resigned today there was one just the other day you know he he wanted to vacation and his church told him just to go ahead and leave I didn't tell you the name of that they can tell it to you now later on ain't none of our business it's just a point of what I'm trying to get if you say brother random was wrong like a brother said he said I ain't having one of them one of them pictures of the cloud that's going down the stairs used to be up here but that he said having one of them in my church well I would get my church my seal book and and I would go burn it if that's the way I believed but yet he preached the seals well I thought that was were that the angel of the Lord met the prophet to tell him about to come back to Jeffersonville and the seals would be broke you see what we do a congregation amen poor people yeah okay come on but when it happens somebody just comes along and plants a little seed well you know brother Dale I believe what he was talking about he said when he said so and so that's all you've done I've Illustrated it right and I can go say you know brother Carly minus Wade seems like he don't oh forget it forget it I went and I brought it up or not I brought it up now in the court of law that's what you call uh things to get attention it's not allowed right and the judge will tell you in a hurry jury smike that from your thinking it's done been said now welcome well what's it called against me you see how easy it is to be deceived but he said we're living below our privileges why because we're allowing people to shift from us the truth of the message or the hour and yet they're claim to believe it right believe in the Lord privileges now we'll go to number nine okay which is a revelation of Jesus Christ Church age book page 15. very familiar with all of us and remember now watch Christ into church is a continuation in the book of Acts I don't see the book right words at church just got it where Silver and Gold Have I None but in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk huh I've heard preachers say that preachers That was supposed to be preaching faith now his brother ran right or wrong I'm going to say what he says you're just going to do what you want to he says this is a continuation of the book of Acts so the book of Acts never left the Holy Ghost was in every Church age right with the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it watch making it lukewarm formal and Powerless now how does he do that The Book of Revelation exposes Satan revealing his Works what is it attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows now listen to him that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works come on and watch what will it be by God's spirit come on let's go back she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits now what two Spirits are you talking about within the framework of the Christian church I only know two spirits one is God the others the devil now if you've got anything in between it's got to be in one of those categories all right so God wants us to believe it Satan wants us to doubt it right the two spirits were within the framework of the Christian church can I can I read it this way spirits in Lula Georgia see I don't mind talking but I'm trying to say sold I ain't trying to build buildings and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit how do you withstand a spirit boy you got a bad spirit I detect that bad Spirit that's a bad spiritual guy amen well I got discernment how do you discern a spirit the only way I know is by the word whether it agrees with the word or difference with the word of course you got the middle in between you know maybe in a way I'm you look Satan will be powerless before her he'll be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood is every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with a true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we'll Prevail over them look how simple a prophet could make it that we're living before below our privileges what is living before below our privileges what is living before your privilege he's not knowing who you are right right when you don't know who you are you're living below your privilege you know I mean somebody come along and tell me say hey Mr Dale we got some records of course all this has to be false because I my daddy was poorer than I am would you say your daddy left you a hundred million dollars all you gotta do is collect it no and I'd say no way my daddy didn't have no money died poor you know what I'm doing I'm living below my privilege right good only got to do is go collect it but instead of doing it I'm letting some human interpretation block me away from what God is trying to say to me like I've always said to you we people will say oh if Lula had more signs and wonder how many churches can you save it's got six cases of the Dead raised I'm not throwing off on nobody but you know what let somebody over in Africa some of these big name guys hear of some church and you know what I believe it I believe that lady over there was getting that meal up and cooking it and it was appearing right back in the barrel I believe that you know why because I'm a Believer but compile meal in a barrel to dead raised come on Church we've seen the word spoken we don't have to back down it's on record but the main thing is whether or not we stayed with the word and I don't agree with your attitude in your ways your way of saying things you're just so sure it's fine with me I got to deal with those things myself you show me where you can turn down the word just because it I look at you and say you're ugly right give an illustration you know said the other day brother Colin say he's ugly and then he looked back at me and said you're ugly and I am well I'd agree with him we see people think well that's but what about the word what does the word say well I don't know whether that's the word or not you've been in this message how long and you don't know what the word says well you've been reading a lot of Greer's Almanac maybe a few Playboy magazines in between now you're getting okay listen discrediting of God's word that's why we're living below our privileges and we'd like to get this next one look at number 10. I probably ain't gonna get done this morning again this is what I had Wednesday night to bring and I okay look what he says in Israel and church 1953. I truly believe before the church can have the rapture now that what we've been talking about Rapture called away you know it's got to have Rapture and faith not watching we can't even have faith for Divine Healing let alone Rapture in faith but you know what how many people read the rest of it come on how many sermons have you ever heard of we live below our privileges how many preachers have you ever heard say we ain't got enough faith for Divine Healing how can we be raptured and that's all they say right right come on you didn't listen come on Doc I said the other day you picked me to death about the things I say why don't you pick these others you listen to you know what I'm saying the truth the preachers are saying it we ain't got enough faith for Divine Healing sermon I had a sermon how are we gonna have fight for a rapture you never hear how to have faith you only hear what you ain't got right right I know it I'm sarcastic an old dude that's it forget it but what is the truth look what he says sure we can't even have faith for Divine Healing that's wonderful I believe it but we've seen healing now what do you want to talk about we've seen the dead Rays now what do you want to talk about well because it don't happen in your church and your group or your people you don't believe it that's what I told you I used to pray for that brother that used to come here wrote all over the country I pray that God would not do nothing when he's here why because people back then will start running now you can have the dead race every day in this church and it wouldn't add one person to this building oh yeah you get these Great Signs and want to start out we'll get to it later in the message when the signs and wonder starts happening and people see it's going to start happening over in that Baptist Church too I can quote wrote a random remember come on I thought brother random said the third pool was for the bride and the church and to the totally long but do we quote him no we quote what we want oh how can we have we don't have Divine hate and how long can we outrage and fight how can we have faith to be changed the quicker this body be taken away look I believe there's a church on this road tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning amen and the church is coming out not a psychological it's everybody pronounce that word not some of this put on make-believe but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out Church 53. not the earliest thing find but that's pretty early isn't it brought around was looking forward to that okay now we're going to read a few and I know what most people are thinking is at that point where Jim seals he he was talking about them Shields then would one day be open I've got a bunch in here if I got time to read if I don't want to get up this evening a worried after the seals he's talking about a great church if it was the sealed why is he talking about it later I believe in the seals come on folks I believe it's part of it all right look what he says here on 1953 God's commissioning Moses go ahead number that's number 11. there you go I have a great faith to believe that one day before the coming of the Lord and our little differences will be settled God may have to let communism sweep us together but something will take place that'll make us all one heart in one Accord now if you don't look around now and see the way this economy is in situations is going exactly and don't see that he looked back there and saw this here I mean you blind if we can't have faith now for healing see there that's all they quote on this one the little quote we can't have fight now for healing and we're going to have a Rapture in faith hmm we've got to have faith for the little things first amen right before the great thing what does the Bible say you can't keep up with the footman what about when the Horseman get here if you can't do good in the times of what is plenty what in the swell in the Jordan or whatever there's another scripture in there what do you see so there will be something that'll cause that's on that's in God's Providence so it must be if it's a Providence means it's planned set forth and going to take place right I do not know but I've seen her this demonstration of it recently you know it's probably referring beyond the curtain of time I don't know none of my business we'll look at the next one this is taken from now these are 53 53 53 I've received that daughter Prophet John and oh God grant today that when we can all come together and see all those nine spiritual gifts moving through the church operating the whole church body then we have the then we'll have the rapture yeah there's the simple things coming into the Rapture right then it'll be called out you're reading it there's evidently a culling coming you know because it's gonna be cold out and the way we used to do was culling things as we we used to raise potatoes and you take your sweet potatoes and you burn them in the ground and and you you make sure you put good potatoes there with no scars or broken places some of these older ones remember because if you put one in there with a rotten spot or a place that could cable rotten you know what it's going to do rotten every one of them you've heard the old story about the rotten apple you know one in the barrel Roger whole Lane so he's evidently going to call it out then it'll be cold out and we'll have the rapture remember he's prophesying are you with me if we can't have faith for Divine Healing how are we going to have faith for rapturing faith the church has got a ways to go yet well that's where we're stopped amen we got all that well we just meet the people to death you ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing but what did he say but I believe God will do it evidently he's looking forward to it look at the next one 13. these are still in 53. he said it off the message um God talked to Moses huh I believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal whatever I used to pronounce it the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders it's great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days and that's the thing that'll bring Faith into the people that'll take a Rapture in faith they'll take the church into Glory he believed it back there look the next one let's see we're going up 54 I think on this one he's going to have his provided way now we're moving right in right on into another great age he was looking forward to something wasn't it coming of the Rapture of the church and this we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts they stumbled many of the big fine churches and sent nazareness backwards it made Fanatics out of a lot of Pentecost but just the same God's moving right on bringing in the rap string faith for his church that's right so tonight I represent that faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints in the way of a Divine Healing gift look at the next one 59. what was the Holy Ghost given for if you feel the least tug don't turn it away what is the Holy Ghost God in you what's it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together to bring a church to a place in this day far beyond the Lutheran methodists and Pentecostals into a place to an adopt a adoption and a Rapture in Grace that when this part of the church and watch them is down there come up Laura when the spirit moves into this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth bringing forth all of the redeemed let's touch that spirit old Lutheran that stood for the truth is going to raise why because something's going to happen to you and I let me read five all right look at the next one is this the sign of the end sir look what he says you remember what that was you remember this is the time of the end that's when all of the visions and the things happened and he was to go west and connect and come back is that really them seven Thunders fixing to utter out something that's a little group that is gathered together will receive a rapturing faith and go in the rapture when he comes and there's your lord descended from heaven with a shout we'll get to that in about two more messages down the road or we'll be changed as quick as those angels come and we know the Thunder's the voice of God when the seals broke to the prophet and him preaching and so we don't have no problems right now let's get one into seal book go to the next one 17 in the first seal paragraph 75. I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for Rapture and faith all right because what we got right now we wouldn't able to be able to do it I agree with that quote but don't take out all of this and this and just read that quote that's right you're killing the people look there's something we've got to step father we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment to be swept up out of this Earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing find where it's written all right now let's go after the CEOs in case you're thinking that all of the things brother Brown and was looking forward in his early Ministry was just the opening of them seals but what was he looking forward to after the seals broke let's read Feist look once more 63 11 17. after the seals broke Lord Jesus Great Master Of Life The Shepherd of the sheep come forth Lord these people are hungering they're thirsting Lord years I've wanted to see this happen maybe it will just once more Lord one more great move of the spirit One More Time Lord and the church might receive the rapturing faith to go in granted Lord make known that you are with us and we will praise thee for it in Jesus name we ask it just once more Lord look the next one three kinds of Believers three 63 12 24. now what kind of sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace God promised him brother Dale are you looking forward to a great baptism of the Holy Spirit from Heaven always have since I read the prophet well you don't believe it's all back there with him no because this is after the seals broke he said he didn't care I'm a scientist sometimes there is a heaven and there is a literal Jesus Christ the Earth that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth God said it that's that's what Believers believe go to the next one the token 1963 11 28. I'm looking for a time of a breaking forth of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that and I believe that we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence I believe that the time to lay us out our Creeds and our thoughts and come back to the work what is the rapture it's an excellent spiritual food and due season 65. I want you to get built up now in the this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of the hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age or this has to be Rapture and Faith be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard and the word that you have heard preached the signs and the Wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if that be God or not okay after the seals broke okay two more or what else we'll go we'll leave that you remember when we used it in the message the other week or what faith really is according to Hebrews 11. he said it's the substance of things so far and I tried my best to explain as the prophet has explained it that the varieties we're supposed to be built on Revelation we're supposed to be built under thus saith the Lord the revealed word we're supposed to seek God for a revelation more than anything else how many of those are those are quotes right but on the rep Rapture message and he said but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that Revelation on the rapture that's paragraphed 65 because it is of the rapture the right is to be waiting for the revelation of the rapture you know if you're waiting for a bus don't go to the train station go to the bus depot you take it wait for the bus right you said I'm ready I'm at the bus station you got your ticket no I don't think I need you I'll get it when he gets here Bush might pull up and run off without you 40 something years we've had time of preparation for God to do something I want to read this last one which is taken from Oneness number 23 brother at 189 I want to just read this what is it you got to get with the word get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost nobody received just we we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place that we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything now is that what you've heard preach basically all of your life since you've been in the message foreign fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely dead to yourself or to your thinking just to surrender in God till his words just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word our life see you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it's life my words are life say Jesus he's placed it with them teachers believe in the Bible prophets that say the truth that say show the same prophecy that they always did down through the age what's he done he's showing himself among them confirming his word and his word is the kingdom of God is God's word made Power we're looking for something but do we know what we're looking for right like I said we'll pick up this afternoon a little talk that remember Jesus does all three of these things the shout divorce of Archangel Trump as he's descending and Paul in Thessalonians his dealing with being caught up Paul in Thessalonians does not use the word change that's in Corinthians so then the Lord can do all three and it's right here and we ain't got to change yet it could be right here right now waiting on you and I to see it by revelation waiting on you and I to recognize Who We Are right brother Carly it is he that hath made us where the college said that years ago and it really stuck with me is he that hath made us and not we are sales we are his people sheep of his pastor whatever we are he's made us it's not something we've done we're not goody goodies and we were brought in the message not we're batty baddies because that's where we are the Baddie Baddie Gods is the one comes into the message the goody goodies don't need the message come on right so we don't glory in the Baddie baddies but we're glory in the baddies make goody okay because it's what he does with us what about taking a bunch of garbage cans and making a beautiful wife oh wonderful God's Great Jewel what do you think about it sitting in Heavenly places you know what I can say this without one ounce of remorse or talk involved in it that ever since I've been in this message I've been in a rapture how many of you have ever seen me really down and out don't say I hadn't been down and out I said how many of you have seen it my wife is the closest one she'll tell you in a hurry that I'll get over it and it doesn't stop me in the word of God when things start going rough I start studying more I start reading more I start praying more brother now you don't like me when I'm down and out I'm just down and out I don't feel like praying and saying what do you feel like doing whoopee you know I mean watch the whole world supposed to quit because you're down and out and came to see me and he used to go to church with us and he'd heard I've got sick and just after we left the Baptist Church and he'd heard it I was sick you know me if I was at home from work and doing things and in the bed you know I sick and he came in and we sat down and we started talking after a while he said I thought I'd come over here because you're sick I've had days until his brother Gary wrote that song from the bottom looking up that I couldn't even say I was at the bottom it was way below there but I never let you know it why because I'm not supposed to let you know it I'll go through the house and reach up in the medicine cabinet and very rare but sometimes I'll take a aspirin my wife immediately when she comes through and sees she said what's wrong with you that's how I got a little headache she even gets on to me when I go to the doctor so when I go into the doctor and he said how you doing I'm doing wonderful she said well what are you doing at the doctor if you're going to tell him how wonderful you are so I developed the way of saying it I said he's how you doing I said I'm doing wonderful but I got a bad cold can you get me over this or help me why because I'm sure they sit there and look at you if it's God's doing fine what's he doing here do you understand but yet we've got that pity party oh everybody's against us don't nobody love me all right you know to have friends you must be friendly right to have a happy attitude you need to have a happy attitude let your face know it you know I've always said I'm sorry I'm comical hey I know the quotes was listening to take the other night it's preaching 62 so we should go listen to it you know everybody's always said don't be cutting up Ryan said don't cut up is that a quote don't cut up don't do this I'll find you the name of the tape but it's in 62. he said you know what he said these people around here got a little sense of humor he said you remember old brother Bosworth said he had a sense of humor he said you know what I found one day he said God's got a sense of humor but you don't ever hear that it's always don't be happy well he spoke to me I'm happy folks we're letting our conduct is that what we read one ago tear us down we come in here and we talk about healing and signs and wonders and things happening Among Us and God has done those things and you go back outside in the I'm going to go to the doctor said I got so and so there's nothing wrong going to the doctor no we're going to doctor we believe in it but who's the Healer the doctor which one you folks brag on the most of course before you get out of the building you'll be doing that you'll be talking about how bad you are I thought we were resurrected sitting come on musician I thought we were resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus why don't we live like Heavenly places and act like Heavenly places right well us trying a song now what we're going to sing well ain't none of us got nothing and we're all right get that tune up brother give me give me tune on that well all in bad shape and we'll see well see I never heard a song when I do like that of you but you know the kind of songs we like is I know I got a memory and I'm sorry I remember years ago there was a guy wrote a song and I can't think of the name of it or nothing about it the old country music guy and he sung a song and when he finished the song Some of you probably know the song and tell me the name but when he finished he sent it in to be recorded and they sent it back to him and said we don't record songs like that because there's no murder no rape no killings no lying no cheating No Stealing none of those things is in your song he sat down and rewrote the song and said Grandma got killed granddaughter when she was a drunk you know what made a hit right that's what everybody wants to hear how bad you are I've told you this and I mean it there's more crime solved because of the loudmouth people who've done the crimes can't keep their mouth shut they gotta go tell somebody what they've done because it's hard to live in a shell when nobody's as bad as you are so you want to find somebody as bad as you are tell them how bad you are and you don't want nobody like me to say that's down and out you ought to quit that you wanna well we all have problems hey I don't have to read minds I don't have to discernment I read faces I preach something around here and say something about something I know what you're thinking you know what you're thinking brother Dale you'll not be picking on them people truth is truth what we got let's stand 138 138 responsible my hope is built on nothing less anybody learn about it you have a need a deliverer a savior I believe the Rapture is in process if he don't come here we don't go there I am resting things you just don't give us that sweetness and all the other fruits the mother free days make us sweet and feel good all right take a piece of ice and do that what about the word what do you think about the word about his feet he's had a lot of problems with his feet right so let's believe let's believe what not that now listen listen to her not that he'll get better that's why we stop then he starts feeling better and we quit praying let's pray until he's totally delivered you heard it taped the other during the last night when you listen brother random called out uh who was it Banks Woods boy that was crippled and he was in a meeting in uh captains I think anyhow he called his name David I think he said David come out here and show the people he had Polio he couldn't walk their life and try I guess if I was David I know what I'd have been doing when you I said I feel good I believe in total livers don't you father in the name of Jesus Christ our brother come up with a desire in his heart yeah we all join together in our prayers and believe in in expecting a total Deliverance not just feeling better that's wonderful but to be delivered to be totally delivered and we believe it and we don't quit until then because we believe your words in the name of Jesus Christ we count itself anybody else before we go thank you Lord don't fall or shine shine father believers ounds rest in his righteousness it's hard for somebody else our Lord someone has got hurt and needs a touch from you Lord so we just send our prayers to that person Lord and you reach down and you touch them and deliver them and may we hear the testimonies that all is well because we believe you father in Jesus name anybody else before we go amen what is your desire I just got a message from his way he's got a message from her son that he's broke down on the highway so let's just pray that the Lord will fix the car why not expect a miracle you know he said well now we're just wait well no no I I I want to see a miracle take place amen and then we can walk into the rest of it so let's believe it we believe it all right if the initial is done it's a finished product it's what we believe father we thank you Lord for this day and your love unto us and we thank you we ask you that you would just go with us now as we go and eat natural meals and then
