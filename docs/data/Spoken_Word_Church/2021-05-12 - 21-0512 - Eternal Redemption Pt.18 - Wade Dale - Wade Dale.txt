brown said one time try his face try his faith talk to him sometimes say lord i need i need some gas in my vehicle brother who was it brother uh yes you're right you did and so did brother um brother harris did one time remember on the side of the interstate and he said lord ain't got no money and i don't have a way to get it and he said he got in that car and fired up and drove it home on empty so amen [Applause] god knew god knew what we need for the foundational world he just wanted you to ask for it you got little you got a little something to do yourself hey man good to be in the house of the lord good to see you sister lois back there with us tonight you knew i was going to say that didn't you it's good to see her smiling face miss her family pray for her mom and dad all the time there so uh good to see y'all also uh remember that uh june the 16th through the 18th we're having our father's day fishing trip where brother ronnie long and brother chris long will be with us also the sisters will be going to pigeon forge so uh we need to start getting that together it's getting about a month away so boy time flying also july the third and fourth we're having our annual meeting well it won't be annual be our first 50th anniversary meeting third and fourth bill jule40 he is excited to be there he called me uh sunday morning and he's ready to go so good and brother mike oltek will be with us that sunday and just keep those senior prayers good to see the young folks up here now that's a good idea whoever come up with that idea and needs to bail us that she came up with that idea she's the sh no she's not shy but yes that's good a lot of churches you go to the kids are made to set up on the front two rows so uh i appreciate y'all doing it on your own and uh and you'll get more if you sit up there amen hey man a little bit of a generational change i was telling them before service usually the older folks were sitting right there in that little spot and and that generation is moving on and a new generation is coming in so that's the way god works he doesn't leave a generation out amen amen he doesn't leave he doesn't skip a generation god never skips a generation i'll remember too that brother dutch said to tell you hello and god bless you and um that uh he we had a good time this weekend on mother's day with them and something i hadn't seen in a long time and i want to say this for the glory of the lord but a lot of times we we think well maybe during the song service we need to you know be you know getting getting it ready and getting everything ready to go and maybe the spirit's gonna fall and maybe somebody will shout and the bible tells me that that the preaching of the word is what always brought this kind of glory down it wasn't the singing now the singing was to set the tone we know that but we were we were preaching just on justification sanctification of baptism the holy ghost of brother duchess and the spirit of the lord fell in the middle of that service and i wasn't i wasn't i was at the end of the down at the aisle preaching away but i mean man that was one sister got to shout and then another couple of sisters got to crying and praising the lord and you know what it was just a wonderful service and but and leading into that we're going to uh brother bob you're going to change send another one out here we're we're developing this plan we're not like god he has an eternal plan never changes ours is not eternal and it does change so if you pull it up on the screen here this is what we're going to be doing starting sunday up here it's been changed just a little bit y'all did great sunday so leave everything where it's at if you're downstairs so but upstairs 9 30 to 9 45 you're gonna have brother brown pre-service that's we do that anyway all right now from 9 45 to 10 15. brother terrence is going to have to take prayer requests and then i'm going to come up and teach sunday school for about 20 or so minutes and i was praying on the way up to illinois sunday and the lord just kind of spoke to me and said just don't take a subject take up one word and me and sister jim got talking about one word prayer then we'll take another word redemption then we'll take another word grace and then we'll take another word something else and we'll talk about it but brother brown was talking about prayer but the bible tells us as was talking about brother dutch is the bible tells us many many times in the book of acts that as the preaching was going on the holy ghost would fall on the people fill them with the holy ghost and they would be you know they'd have a good service so that's kind of what we want to look at that but we'll have prayer reque request adult sunday school class from 9 45 to 10 15. all right that will be up here you downstairs this has nothing to do with you okay you're doing what you normally do then from 10 15 what i'll do is is i'll tell the musicians to start coming up when i wind it down and then brother joe will take his service of songs taking up the the tithes and offerings and have responsive reading to 10 40 and then brother dale will be in the pulpit or whoever's preaching that sunday so everybody got that just a little bit of shift we were gonna we were gonna do it in two parts this is the sunday school format it stays the same so this just basically tells you who's going what the classes are um sister monica will be gone this coming sunday right sister lisa can you swap over and do hers thank you ma'am and but the rest of them will be the same and then the adult sunday school class will be up here from 9 45 to 10 15. so it's just changed a little bit from what you all got and i appreciate brother bob and brother joe sending those out but we had discussed it actually brother aaron came up with this idea and dad and i discussed it and thought that maybe this would give more continuity to the service instead of having songs and doing stuff here and then stopping and having sunday school and then starting it all over again to just go ahead and do first sunday school and then get into the song service we don't want to take away from the song servers but we don't want to take away from the word i mean because the word's most important thing but you do need the song service it has to be a balance so that's what we're going to be doing starting this coming sunday amen also remember that uh brother aaron will be preaching next he's not here next wednesday night so i think that's about got it so let's bow our heads we're going to continue on eternal redemption we're going to bring out a little thought tonight we're talking about generations but there's a man that came on earth that was cut off from his generation amen and we'll read that in isaiah once we get the background done and we'll try to hurry through this on wednesday night so let's bow our heads the heavenly father we pray that you'd be with us tonight sanctify us lord you know what we want to speak to the people but father if it's not according to what you want lord just erase it and you do the speaking father be with the ones lord that are sick and not here be with the ones on the highways lord just let this gas shortage be done and over with and even if it is lord you said you'd take care of your little bride lord so we'll be able to find gas when maybe other people will not and i lord we depend on you that's what you're asking us it too is to depend on you not to depend on man or depend on the uh some kind of computer program but depend on you lord because you're we're the bride and you said you'd take care of us lord father forgive us of our sins bless us and take care of us in this service may we be attentive and listen to you father in jesus name we pray amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building now that's we're going to talk about christ here in just a little bit because he's the he's the he's the the center center of this whole plan all right he's the center person of this whole plan and he really came comes right in the center of the plan amen so he comes in to where he can take the old testament bring them in and then what become the the mediator the bible says but he's the new testator that's that we are living under now which is the new testament not doing away with the old testament but just bringing it to the new testament and we'll touch on that just a little bit out of isaiah neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered him once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us let's read first john 4 verse 16. i still hadn't gotten away and we really had a good time we we kind of weaved in a little bit of this eternal redemption in the service we were speaking on who is worthy how that we come from where we're not worthy in revelations 5 about verse 1 and 2 to where revelations 10 were kings and priests so somewhere we became worthy amen that's the same thing with this eternal redemption there wasn't a time in the mind of god that we weren't worthy you hear what i said in the mind of god the eternal part the genesis 1 26 always was eternal that genesis 1 26 never had a a bad day never was lost but we got lost and then that genesis 1 26 brother bryan said you heard from your theophany you heard from that genesis 1 26 man and then you connected to that genesis 1 26 man and that made you worthy because if he's worthy you're worthy as we were speaking before heirs and joint heirs with christ and then john first there in the book of john where jesus says lord i pray that we be one as me and you are one i pray to us and the people on the earth be one or his children be one and we are one but he had to pray the prayer of intercession that's what we're going to get into sunday there's an interceding there by prayer that we have to have but remember one thing let me throw you a little thought prayer is not eternal we won't pray when we get to the new city there'll be nothing to pray for when we take a glorified body there's nothing for us to pray for it's done it's finished but it's put there though for a temporary because remember in the bible i'm going to start on sunday service in the bible though adam spoke to god lip to ear face to face right but then the bible tells us that when seth was born then man began to call on the name of the lord that's when prayer comes and being instituted all right so just keep that in your mind for this weekend and we have known and believed the love that god has to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him hearing there's our love made perfect see our love is not perfect i feel your love but we're if you have the baptism of the holy ghost you have agape love amen which is perfect because he is so we in this world there is no fear in love a perfect love casteth out fear because fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us we couldn't be lovable we wouldn't know how to love without him being inside of us showing us how to love if a man say i love god and hate us his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now let's go ahead and continue with ephesians one and get these scriptures read not to get them out of the way but to to make sure that we stu we've got our background in ephesians four says according he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world this whole plan hinged on that it was over before it got started it was over before it got started in the mind of god but in order for it to be a plan something had to happen for it to be a plan it's like brother brown said he said now that's why you see that we we've harped so much on for knowledge and on predestination because if it was just you know signed sealed and delivered why would he why would we need to fall why didn't he just bring us here the way we are no he had attributes that he had to display there was a part of god that was not known and that was a savior so in order for someone to have a savior as brother whis read that quote several weeks ago he had to become flesh to save us or to redeem us because the blood of bulls and goats we know can't take away sin it only covered sin but we know that he's according it has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world look that we should be holy and without blame before him in love that's what i was trying to get the people over there to see that you know what the devil's going to beat you we know that the devil that's his job he's never going to listen he's never going to not be around you he's not going to take a vacation but as long as he's here i like what brother schrader said many years ago he said all right devil if you're going to play around in my mind and you're going to look through my eyes we going to read the bible amen we go we're going to read the bible that's the best way to get rid of the devil start reading the bible start praying start reading the message of the hour he hates this bible he hates this word of god because he says look he sees this he says hmm holy and without blame before him in love ah why they do this and they do that and they have these bad thoughts and they have this this and they have their that and their death that's all he is is accuser of the brethren he but what is he accusing you for nothing that god sees that's why i want you to see we have been made worthy by the baptism of the holy ghost and not more worthy as we go up the statue of perfect man but it is more of god being closer to us than he's ever been close to anybody before you say even paul even i'm just saying i believe paul was was up that pyramid because he had a lot of things but now he never had the body change that you and i are looking to and we're looking at the body change and we're looking at something that no one even jesus didn't have a body change without death so see we're looking at this and but we're never going to get anywhere if we can't believe what he's already said that we should be holy and without blame before him in love all right having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ i was telling them over there i said look first thing you got to do is know that you're a child of god you've got to get in the family first that's our problem not ours but a lot of people's problems they say i'm in the message and i i think i'm you know it's kind of like the the cousin you had never met before comes to church you know and then they just start showing up a little more and a little more well you know you need to be in the family you need to be sons and daughters of god heading toward adoption whether you're there or not that's okay but heading toward it we have so we god is in motion like some of y'all are not this don't excite you i don't know what's going to make you happy having predestinated us into the adoption of children so listen he's going to have a bride he is going to have a family listen genesis 1 26 prove that he's going to have a family now and then there's a plan that's woven into that to know that we were he knew we were going to fall and he knew that he was going to redeem us back to that place not another place brother brown said redemption is not replacement but if you drop this on the ground and it was right here and you drop it on the ground and you put it over here that's not replacement right that's just putting it in another place you got to bring it back to where he said let us create man in our own image that's what we got to see see everybody else you know you may be redeemed but you may be over here somewhere we got to get redeemed back to where we started from amen i agree with i agree with the message of the hour you always was eternal but there was a time you were not or this plan doesn't work in order for this plan to work somebody had to be lost somebody had to fall look in verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood why'd he come and do all he did with it and and then we just don't need it because we always was no we needed that man we needed that god to become flesh to create a blood cell as we're going to read here in just a minute he made his own blessing to make sure that the plan was going to work he was the plan but you and i are the ones that are connected to it amen but now remember though as we were talking about sunday remember at the quote i read you where brother mom said now jesus didn't come down here to bring you your inheritance does everybody understand what brother i'm saying because what's happening is is he goes on in in the uh in the quote because i've met people that said that jesus that god of course they were trinitarians god sent jesus to earth makes to see if somebody feels sorry for him and he died for them because they're going to feel sorry for him well now brother brown said i wouldn't run my business like that and god don't run his business like that he came down here to get who he'd already sworn you but he had to come down here because the bible says he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and he was slain for the whole world but there's only a group of people in john 17 that's why i like john 17 that's our prayer because he's praying for his kids he's not praying for the devil's kids he's not praying for the world that's what he said he said i'm not praying for the world he said i'm praying for the ones that are in the world amen because we're in this world and then we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence look having made known unto us the mystery of his will talk to people outside they're the most confused people in the world i mean from christians all the way down to centers this whole world's got them confused come out of a kobe 19 and survive that now you can't get out of the house cause you can't drive a car you ain't gonna gas the devil's like a pinball he's bouncing us all around everywhere i don't like being a pinball amen having made known under that's the mystery of his will well listen when we're going to start realizing that we're not we're not becoming worthy we're already worthy if you got the baptism of the holy ghost and like i said before use what you already got and if you don't got it get it that's pretty simple if you don't got it get it and once you get it i was reading a quote just a few minutes ago brother bob said the reason your prayer life's off the reason all these things are off in your life he said get the baptism of the holy ghost he said it will change your life i was listening to you all sunday and brother dale brother bob wonderful job always but i heard all the clapping well i guess y'all don't want to say a man loud enough and shout and praise the lord so you just let your hands be happy and that's okay as long as you make some kind of noise it keeps some of you awake yes and then we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to look to the riches of his grace having made known unto us the mystery of his will let's go down to verse 10 then in the dispensation of the fullness of times i want you to really get this before we go any further this is for you and you only right when brother branham stood there in in 1963 and preaching the seals he said this is for my people only he was not just saying the people that were sitting in that congregation because he had just told them before about a year later or year before in the seals that it's not even for you but they got a blanket let me put it this way they got a grace of marriage and divorce for the people that were there we understand that but it's not for the whole world he said these are to my followers only well this message is to to the followers of brother adam alone it's not to anybody else they can't understand us they and i was talking to somebody the other day um it wasn't us talking to him but anyway we were talking about something i said you know they can accept a prophet that they call the prophet the world calls a prophet john hagee and all the different ones and i'm going to call names because they're they can be christian people nominal christian people benny hen all these different ones they re revere him and they listen to his tapes and they watch his sermons and they read his literature but when you say god's saying that's the prophet william brown don't like you know why because he's not like those other ones he's out of the norm all these others like joel osteen doesn't preach on sin no wonder he's got 15 000 people if you quit preaching on sin everybody's going to come to church but they listen to him and they revere him and they talk they put his name up on you know on a pedestal but when we talk about god sending us a a word prophet right out of the bible right out of the bible they go no no no it's he just wasn't he might have been okay but he got wrong and you know why because his doctrine was different all the mother doctrines are pretty much you can put them all in a in a soup bowl and and uh yeah put them in a box it kind of reminds me remember when elisha met those sons of the prophets they had went out and collected some what wild gourds some wild doctrines and they come back in and said man this is it this is let's eat this right here let's eat this word because it's gonna and elijah walks in and goes if you eat that it's gonna kill you so we had an elijah in this day to come and he throw some meal into the pot what my pot in your pot to get us out of those denominational ideas so that we can live and that pot will sustain us and not kill us because we were dying out there in the world we were dying out there in the denominations that in the dispensation the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven which on earth even in him and him also we have obtained an inheritance well it doesn't sound like we just got something we inherited we haven't obtained you got to go get it you had to john john said give me the book give me the book angel you can't have it got to give it to me amen being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the council of his own will let's read quote number one tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there ever was a time in history that the manifest the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the old testament you see right there brother brown tells us it wasn't any holy ghost poured out in the old testament and no new birth now the holy ghost was anointing the people but they weren't heading on your birth on down there there couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things now look you think brother branham have you not ever read exodus talk about manifestation god took a nation bigger than the united states and drove them to their knees with manifestation of the power of god he's not talking about that kind of manifestation he's talking about manifestation of the word of god in a group of people not just anointed because look he brings in this little word it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone there's your body changed the rest of them didn't have that to the manifestation of sons and god coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men not one man these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ so they'll join him and his church together amen amen wow it'll join what back to that genesis 1 26 man where adam and eve were literally one person and god and adam was one person god and adam and eve was one person and that's what he was praying in john 17 that they the bride be one as you and my father are one now how many is that there's only one god and the manifestation of god in the end time is the bride so we're totally a part of this plan outside of everything else just like i said before this is just to the bride we're the only ones now brother brown said we're the only ones that'll have perfect love we're the only ones that we have his potential right and we will do his will we will do what the bible says we will do what and i don't say we'll do what the message says because that's killed a lot of people doing just what the message says let's do what the word of god says it will direct us to the message amen if we'll get that right to start with we'll get born again get the people to christ get make sure you're justified make sure you're sanctified make sure you're filled with the holy ghost not just have an anointing of this message because an anointing of this message is just going to kill you look at these people that's been preaching we were talking about this sunday 30 or 40 years people have been preaching with a true anointing because they preached truth some of them preached good truth but somewhere they didn't go all the way that anointing is going to have to lift off of them eventually but listen with me and you as the bride of jesus christ that anointing never lifts off of us that's what's going to change our body that's what's going to take us in a rapture is that anointing that is on us which is the headstone anointing that no one else has got jesus was the headstone we are the anointing of the headstone which makes us still won it's real simple we talk about headstone we talk about these different things you know maybe some of the young people don't understand but when you have a headstone some people think about headstones and having a gray on the grave but there's a headstone that and they call it the keystone or the headstone that the ark goes up and there's a stone that sits right up in the middle of that right man everybody got that and it's usually like a pyramid some of them upside down but anyway the door is held up basically by that they call it the keystone if you pull that thing out it collapses well see you and i we we know one thing's for sure paul and ireneus and all them they are part of that but the key to get them out of the ground is me and you the plan that we're talking about here that there is a generation that was cut off during the church ages and all you and and not be little no one folks we listen but they without us can't be made perfect whatever they got they're waiting on the last piece or they're waiting on the headstone we had a prophet come and bring us that headstone message the seven seals that told us all these things we couldn't listen how in the world can you we preach what we preach and not know have a background of the message of the hour you're just presuming you're just out talking right because where are you going to take clarence larkin who you going to take you're going to take john hagee he's pretty good john mccarthy he's pretty good guy i like to listen to him i just i admit it he's got some good points but he's not the one i listen to to get what i listen to with a message amen because they do have some good points clarence locker must have some pretty good points because brother brown used some of his points he used some of scofield's points but see there's a piece missing in their message the piece of scofield that's missing in the message was he's a trinitarian so that knocked him out of any of the headstone message everybody got that that not john hagee and all the different ones they're all trinitarians so they have a brother they have a loose end or they have a flaw that can't get them connected like you and i are connected because jesus was the connection and i just read you a quote where brother brown said these men so perfect till their massive message will be so close like christ till it'll join him and his church together and that was the opening of the seals but now see but then when once the old book note once the seals were open you got 14 different versions of what the seventh seal is polygamy we're already in the millennium do whatever you want to because we're you know it doesn't matter what this guy does oh come on people it don't matter what this thing does but you're gonna show what's inside of there that's making that thing do what it's doing amen that's what we're looking at it's the inside guy that makes the outside guy work look at number two how can i take a huckleberry and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it's because inside that kuckerberg has been transmitted from a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cocker burn it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right because there has been a life of wheat put in that cucumber i want us to get that down you have to have eternal life given to you down here in these first three dimensions before you get born again you can't get born again without your soul being burnt out that new nature put in burn your nature out and and then the bible tells us that we're a new creation we're a new creature brother brown uses the word vulcanize are you vulcanized you can't be wood and rubber and vulcanized so what vulcanizes you saying well i'm just a sinner yeah but before the foundation of the world god cut a piece of that tire off and he preserved that piece of that tire you came down here with a hole in it i know you went with and you were flat right you loved the world and the things of the world but god had that patch ready for you so he could bring it down to you and guess what fire puts them two together and then you cannot separate them because you take rubber you take genesis 1 26 you take the theophany of god and you put him in yours and you seal it together and god listen god can't even pull it apart oh that's what makes me happy god can't even pull it apart much less the stinky old devil he heard me say that but we live in these first three dimensions we have to because jesus even tells us in john 17 i don't have it there just i'm going to try to quote it he says in other words i don't want to take them out of this world that would be too easy he said but i'm going to pray for him that they'll stay in this world but in other words be preserved because you know what jesus was almighty god he was walking around in a pretty sinful place amen that's the same way me and you we're walking around in a sinful place and we're god almighty and human flesh hello we're god almighty and human flesh not going to be we are we've just got to realize wake that thing up listen there's a butterfly in there somewhere but you gotta die caterpillar you gotta die caterpillar and then you gotta do what free virtue knowledge right oh let's get wait a minute please temper temp come on home come on come and help me temper patience godliness but you know what when that butterfly works its way out my little bees they told us a long time ago they said do not help those bees and you know what you're not supposed to help a chicken or anything come out of its shell you're supposed to let it peck its way out the bees are stronger and live longer when they peck their self or eat their way out of their cocoon or their sh cell or shell same way with anything that's the same way with me and you we got to have trials we got to have tribulations we got to have things in this life light time and matter that's not going to matter when we get done with this thing amen the devil it's just going to all be burned up amen but we have to live here to what for a testimony it's part of the plan and then he give us a fourth dimension of science and the tree of knowledge of good and evil the fifth dimension we know where that is that's hell but it's not burning remember it's not a burning place it is a place of judgment waiting judgment thank god we don't have to do that amen have you ever really just sat down and thought about and you read in revelations what's going to happen that men and women are going to literally cry for the rocks to fall on them to die and they can't right and that birds will eat your flesh while you're still alive i'm not trying to scare you in to be a christian i'm just telling you what's up what you're going to be up against if you don't make this thing and i'm not telling you a fable it's in the bible amen it's in the bible that's what's going to happen after we leave after the grace of god is gone from this place and what is the grace of god we're going to get into that the bride is the grace of god millions of people are going to get eternal life just because you walked in front of them just because you were what part of their economy and they were good to you they're going to get eternal life just because of that besides all the other besides all the spiritual birth that brother dale's give us all yeah you gotta have a pastor didn't it did somebody preach on that sunday i think somewhere we gotta have a pastor and he's the one to lead us through amen i was talking to the guy last night when we came back from illinois he's trying to be a nominal christian the guy that we that we uh live in his man cave um and we hunt up there brett just remembering your prayer he's having a battle but he's trying to be good he's like kind of like jim's dad he's trying to good his way into heaven you can't do that you can't do that the rich young ruler rich rich young ruler he didn't make it but now look i told brett i said look you can be a good samaritan that's fine but i said if you're a christian you're a sheep and sheep is a hurt animal and listen what happens when the sheep gets away from the herd that's the first one that the wolves we've seen it many times you watch those national geographic the slowest one the sick the sickly one and the one they can cut out from the herd becomes food for the nation for the for the coyotes or the jackals or whatever you want that's the same way with god with god you stay in the herd but you get out away from the herd the devil's the first one is going to pick you up listen we need to be together we need we're herd animals we're sheep we have to have a what a shepherd sure you say well i've got god i can stay home now that's not what the bible said you got to go back to the plan the plan says we need a five-fold ministry and a pastor to lead us or a shepherd to take that hook every once in a while and pull us back in amen but he does it by this next thing he does it by what perfect love we talked about paradise we know what happened there but perfect love brother brown he went across the curtain of time this is perfect love that's god love god's love isn't that what you spoke the holy ghost was i said yes this is perfect love let's go to number four now watch the first is perfect love that's god love pure and unadulterated the next coming there is filial love see see god give us filial love to be in the first three dimensions and be able to live and love and have a family love your wife love your kids love your most of your in-laws and most of your relatives no the bible says we need to love the ones that hate us okay okay i'm gonna read it sunday it says pray for those who despise you wow despise you the first is perfect love that's god love pure adultery the next comes in there is filial love that's love that you have for your wife and your children the next drop after that is lustful love the next is ungodly love and just goes on down till it's filth just keeps on perverting perverting now remember but we go back the other way and if you have agape love you can't have agape love without not having the new birth but now watch let's go to number six go through here real quick from that time in in oregon brother brown said look i'll say this with the faith that i have in that vision he's talking about going across the curtain of time whatever it was i'll speak in the name of the lord except you have that perfect love you'll never be there because nothing could ever be there without it your spirit would be out of place there and that's why that's what i tell you happens in a church service you don't need to have discernment just start preaching the word of god and you'll watch people squirm and then they'll do this and then they'll then they'll try to go outside and they'll try to get away from it why there's an anointing there that's going out and it's beating up against that what that other spirit that's here amen but what spirit wins the one you let win the one you that win is the one that wins what what the chief saying now in me black dog white dog that's even being after being a christian you're still sitting there and you're fighting white dog black dog black dog sleep white dog awake amen anyway let's go to number eight it's that anointed anointed with the real spirit see that holy spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germ that germ is the word see and how i don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love there's that's one of the inlets to spirit you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love god and still not be listen you can't you can't love god with agape love without having that agape love already inside you i'm not going to say that again i might be able to say it but without a god be love it's just filial love and there's a lot of people sit in this message and love god in their spirit it's showing look but the bible tells us even when we talk about what we want the manifestation of the sons of god we want the manifestation of the word well comes the manifestation of the word and manifestation of the sons of god is going to push the other ones out because they're going to be manifested also whatever spirit they have whatever spirit we have is going to manifest itself because listen you're not going to carry an evil spirit to that next dimension that we're going to the sixth dimension if you pass away or even if they come here in this dimension then we go back to that dimension with a body change like i said before your spirit's got to be familiar do we walk in church and do we do we pray do we read our bible because our spirit is familiar with that act or is it uncomfortable for us to read our bible and to study the word of god is it uncomfortable for us to come to church am i talking to somebody is it uncomfortable for us to come to church it should be the most comfortable place listen this should be a place to where when that priest walked into that holy of holies and that i could i can hear it i can hear that curtain go and he's standing in a place with nobody but him and god amen nobody but him and god he's he's he and he's standing there on the foundation that everything god had told him to do that he did it because if one thing was wrong he wasn't in there very long they had to drag him out and send another one in but there you're in the shekinah glory well now what about what about now folks that's your kind of glory's not you don't have to go into it if you're born again you're already in it you're just living in the shekinah glory you're living in the the curtain falling behind you and it's you and god alone let's read number nine real quick i shortened this one down perfect faith brother brown said real genuine love will create a confidence in his word see now we tell we we say well now that was i hope john hagee doesn't hear me because he's a pretty nice guy but if john haley was to say this they'd print it in the book they'd put it all over the country and then the voice of the martyr or somewhere boy john hagee said real genuine love will create a confidence in his word but if you say william brown said that let's go okay to me that just sums everything up right real genuine what agape love will create a confidence in his word listen folks that's the only thing's going to get us out of here it's the confidence in what's already been wrote i think the problem is is we're waiting for something new to happen we're waiting for some new book or some new tape or some new book of maccabees is going to be authenticated by the prophet well no the prophet's gone he authenticated the bible 66 books of the bible we ain't got to hunt no other book nowhere else let's read number 10 position of a believer in christ under the law under the shadow they entered in under the shed of shedding of blood of goats and bulls which we went through which could not take away sin i wish people could believe that and see that the the new birth that was known you birthed in the old testament to save those people because it was a life of an animal how can that little lamb's life listen if that little lamb's life come back in you yes what you do you go outside and eat grass and walk on all fours and man cause you're gonna be the life that's inside of you that's why we act like the devil because he's inside of us that's why we act like christ cause he's inside of us but the blood of bulls and goats couldn't make us act like that that's right that's pretty simple to me it was the life of an animal how could the life and spirit of a dead animal coming out of the blood of life the cell of life breaking forth the blood that was shed ever that life ever returned back into an animal or a man the life of a lamb a heifer goat or an animal that's been sacrificed that's our problem we get a spirit of a goat butt but but but it's been sacrificed after the blood has been broken for our sins look that's why it never returns back and having anything to do with a human being it could not but god before the foundation of the world foreordained that jesus would come the perfect lamb of god into a perfect cell that god himself created to bring blood into the world to offer that blood he brought his own blood listen he saw this plan to the end gloria and he acted it out because he's the one that wrote it he's the one that saw it so let's put our confidence in that and he keeps on going if you turn him down in this hour i don't want to get into that please don't turn him down but look the very nature of god is in you you're still subjected to mistakes but god can't see it because it's covered by his blood and when you it's covered by his blood it's not just covered it's eradicated amen because it's covered by the blood god can't see through the blood every time he looks through the blood it looks white he looks through the blood it looks white so now let's talk just a minute about let's pull the chart up just a second if you will brothers tada because here jesus christ thank you there you go that's for the older people the bigger fonts for the older ones just the laws don't laugh it'll happen if you just it'll what can you see that you can't see it honey we got some somebody got so hand her something don't we have some of these back here somewhere oh here we go you want one huh no well forget it then so anyway now you can see it now look they're making it bigger but look we come here and we know that this is life like matter but i want to show you something here here's jesus christ like i said he's the he's the the center of this whole plan right because this same man that we're going to talk about in just a minute in isaiah this same man was standing back here creating so he can't get it wrong there's no miscommunication our problem is we have miscommunication if i told brother dale something by the time he got back over here to brother zach it'd be zero what i said because we're humans we hear sometimes what we want to hear and so does god but he has the he has to go by what the word says because he wrote it so this same man that we're going to talk about that was and i tried to pull up a few scriptures but i mean my heavens if 400 scriptures were fulfilled just at the crucifixion how many other hundreds spoke of him coming right amen i have him getting here and the birth of jesus and the birth of this messiah the birth of this savior and then we're going to see in a few more weeks that 90 percent no 99 of the world didn't believe he was who he was right so here you weigh down to like one percent really believe that that was jesus christ now it got better as it went on down to the church ages but back this way right here from the birth of jesus to the death of jesus they didn't nobody believe who he was he had 12 and one of them was the devil now surely he had 120 in the upper room but that was after he come back and went into the people how can you deny something when he's inside of you you can't deny it hey i didn't deny i had the devil inside of me you know why because i manifested exactly what he wanted me to manifest but now you see the creation and you see the seventh dimension which is eternity that the seventh dimension is up here but when man fell we came down here into time and so time is going to run all the way we're going to talk about it later but not now then you come down and raise this up just here thank you we see that now that death came abel was the first person to die and he was put into paradise everybody with me blood of animals covered sin did not eradicate it the two tables of stone were put in the ark and that's what that's what that brother brown said they died believing that the messiah was coming or that jehovah was coming but they didn't see it but they were believing many i got many uh scriptures in there that i was looking at today all those prophets when they all came they prayed they prayed moses prayed for the people elijah elisha nehemiah jeremiah all the different major prophets in the old testament they prayed for the people but what did they do when they prayed for the people the people killed him isaiah was a boy and they tore him completely asunder cut his legs off his arms off and everything because he was a prophet that's why jesus stood right here and she said i know why you don't believe me because you put them in the grave you're polishing isaiah's tomb and you're the one that put him in there what a bunch of hypocrites so here we go we go through time and we see that there was prophets all down through the ages and there were seven church ages in the old testament seven church ages in the new testament but remember the old testament was continued all the way down to here all the way down to pentecost so they got the old testament paradise was emptied out when jesus went and preached to the souls in hell but you know what happened he left them down here they didn't come out with him if you were down here those who turned god down in other words those who turned the atonement down who turned down the word of god for their time all right so they stayed down here jesus preached to the ones who turned god down and they're going to be there until the white throne judgment they're going to be dead for a long time so paradise was right here and then when jesus died he came down here he didn't empty none of this out he testified to him come back up here picked up paradise took it up man i like that can you move it with my finger and then the sixth dimension begins and that's what we've been talking about that's where the born-again believer this is where brother branham went into this sixth dimension where the first martyr was who stephen stephen was the first martyr and then all the ones that died after that they're in that sixth dimension but now you and i are still right here we're still in time but we believe that this man came the birth of jesus according to luke 2 7. but i want you to see something about that man remember jesus christ never had any children physical children but he could he was a man he was ever wet man but he was ever with god all right so let's listen leave that up if you don't mind isaiah 7 14 it says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel matthew 1 verse 19 then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel the lord appeared on him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her as of the holy ghost and i love brother brown uses that example he talks about people saying well who you know is give me your trinitarian idea well you got a father and a son and the holy ghost and you say well now wait a minute who's who was jesus's father well jesus said father what's the father dummy well brother i'm reading this reads this scripture right here and he says now the bible says that the holy ghost was his daddy right here says he was that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his savior's people from their sins and all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall con be with child and bring forth a son and they shall call his name immanuel which being interpreted is god with us folks that was almighty god know we believe that but he was the very essence of god he's he's the very for three and a half years see we only got a three and a half year impact from this from this man sure he showed up at 13 years old and he showed up at nine or he showed up at a little child somewhere but his message is what even all of christendom even all of the world that is part of christianity believes that that man somehow some way either being the second person of the trinity or being almighty god himself but that person had to come and die for us but now listen if he came as a second person then then he told us that he was going to send a comforter back and he's going to be sent in his name it is confusing to the scholars i'm sure but if you'll just take what god said he said right there he said i'm going to send a baby that's going to be born a virgin and he's going to be emmanuel god with us if he created his own body the egg and if he created his own blood the germ sperm and he put it in the womb of mary you see this plan cannot ever fail sometimes we may scratch our head about something that we do but god's not scratching his head he he wrote every how many hundreds of times in the old testament how he was going to come and then when he actually came they called him everything but almighty god and he said show me where i didn't come the way that the prophets told me and that's basically what they said they said well we have moses we have abraham who are you well let's read in isaiah 53. let's see what this guy did for us this commoner this man that spoke a common language this man that was an outcast to the regular world let's go and pull that up if you don't mind brothers isaiah 53. i preached the sermon years ago on who shall declare his generation so let's look at that and see because remember this man jesus see that's what the pharisees they were looking at a man that had never been married and he's sitting there declaring that he's going to have a church he's going to have a people he's going to have a bride he's going to have a group that's going to that's going to emanate from him that's going to come forth from him and he's and they're like you don't even have a wife they just didn't know he was creating his own wife hmm in the bride a wife he was creating his own wife it was just the secret coming it wasn't something that ma'am is going to look out because watch this right here who hath believed our report see they did not and to whom is the arm or the strength of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant he's talking about jesus christ and as a root now this is isaiah the one that killed when he was a little boy because they thought he was crazy and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form or commonness he didn't get up and do his hair every day may not took a bath every day he was a common man but he was almighty god you say what does god look like prophet told us that's the closest we're going to get at the moment amen listen to this because see there's two things that jesus did this man jesus number one he came in human flesh to be our brother to be our boaz but remember in the story of boaz there's a person in between all that right and that's the devil or that other kinsman that's closer that was closer than boaz so even god i hate to say this but it's the only way i'm determined is god had to bow himself down into human flesh and let the devil beat on him because he looked he was 50 years look 50 years old he was only 33 years old but listen to this but there was two things that this man did because he had a body and he had a soul everybody got that then we'll close was only 8 19. he had a body and he had a soul but now he couldn't give his body a ransom it was human that body can't come back on me in you we're his body but the literal body can't come back on me or you but he can do one thing he can do this right here listen to this we shall see and there's no beauty that we should desire him in other words he'd fit in in a crowd and you'd never know who he was he is despised and rejected of men that proved that even and now who rejected him and despised him the most the religious people of the world a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it was our face from him and he was despised and we isaiah says we esteemed him not in other words the world said no this is not who this is surely he hath borne our grief and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted when he was hanging on the cross it didn't look like he was very much right but listen to this but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised see there's the body the body had to come to be the sacrifice because the lamb the flesh of the lamb had to be thrown up on the on the altar amen it had to be killed and then but remember it had a life in it but that life couldn't come back on the believer and even the killing of that animal couldn't heal you no but watch this but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed that body looked like hamburger meat he took on everything you and i took home all we like sheep have gone astray in other words they scattered at calvary we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all right he was oppressed and he was afflicted boy it sounded like he's having a good time on earth yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth remember when he took him into pilots hall they were trying to get him to to to say something to disprove all this rumor but he knew what he had to do he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation he died without having kids see i have kids i have a generation you have kids you have a generation you're part of a generation backwards going back the other way you're part of a generation he was not but he came for a purpose who shall declare his generation so the bible's declaring he has a generation but who's going to declare his generation because i'll promise you folks listen when when they took jesus and and and took him and put him on the cross except for the 11 everybody else just went back to doing what they'd been doing he was just a part of you know like they they the the portrayal in one of the movies is they just took the two thieves after they died and there was a place behind cal behind golgotha it's just a ditch and they just throw them over in the ditch but they didn't throw jesus in the ditch because joseph or armathea took his body and put him in a tomb like the bible said he was supposed to do but to everybody else they just and they just forgot about him never to remember him again caiaphas and him was like man i'm glad we got rid of that guy now it'll be quiet around here all the different religious people but when they when they walked back in that temple and they looked up and they saw the holy of holies they had to turn their head and they had to walk backwards and sew that thing back up because god had rent that temple apart or the curtain apart why testifying who this man was but he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we were healed now watch verse 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living he was cut off in the three dimensions that we live in he was cut off there was no way he could have progeny or a generation because he did not have children they did not come forth from the loins of jesus christ everybody got them he had no children in the land of the living right for the transgression of my people was he stricken now remember the body was a sacrifice the sacrificial lamb behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world the body took the stripes so did paul so did different ones here comes the whole deal right here listen and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin then he'll see his progeny he shall see his seed because remember he was the sore of the seed he was the son of man but it was not sown by the loins of man that's why this thing is secret nobody can understand except a true believer how this man was cut off among the land of the living he did not have any children in other words he just wasted away somewhere they think now you know they think back then they took the body and threw it out in the desert and then they took the body and they eat it that was one story or the disciples stole it and put it wherever when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the what travail of his soul listen that man hanging on calvary did not die he gave his life up into thy hands i commend my soul my spirit so the body could die he was in complete control there's nobody could hang for three hours and took what he took because he what that soul was almighty god and that body had to hang there for me and you as a sacrifice but the soul is what cleanses me and you folks if he hadn't went to hell if he hadn't went to paradise if he had to come back on the day of pentecost then we it was for nothing he shall see the travail of his soul john 17 brother brown said now john 17 was written right at the moment they were leaving the upper room going into the garden everybody understand that if you didn't know that you know it now he prayed that prayer but when he got into gethsemane he was praying for himself that this cup would pass from me and all brother brown said there's where he fought it out not at calvary he fought it out in the garden he just went to calvary to show that he was almighty god and had complete control of everything yet it pleased the lord to bruise him but he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will it i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil romans 8 verse 14 through 16 heirs and joint heirs with christ he went to calvary so you don't have to he died so you don't have to therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death he didn't die he poured out his soul unto death brother brown said played the part of death and he was numbered with the transgressors why he was there with the two thieves and he bear the scent of many and made intercession you see the lamb regular lambs and goats and bulls could not make intercession they couldn't make personal intercession but jesus christ makes personal intercession he's the one that intercedes for me and you he's the one that he's look he's the kingpin of the whole thing if he hadn't come and died and gave his soul a ransom that soul's what went to hell and paid your price not the body the body was there though for your healing musicians come the body was there for your healing he took those stripes for me and you looked like hamburger meat the prophet that god said but that soul was what was gonna save you listen we're not saved by the blood of god we're kept saved by the blood of god we're saved by the life that was in that blood let's stand to our feet that life that was in that blood is what proved because that body just laid there brother brown said the word the body laid there in a tomb dead and cold but where was his soul where was his soul his soul was working for me and you his soul was getting us out of the prison house his soul was coming back on the day of pentecost or resurrecting and then coming back on the day of pentecost he said i'm not going to send a third person he said i'm coming back and i'm going to take you out of here amen you love the lord you got to love what jesus did for you because that same one that said let there be light is that same man that went to hell you see all the brother well all that brother brown said i read you the many quotes your brother brown said jesus went down and knocked on the door opened the door in paradise and abraham said there's a man we fed the calf to amen isaiah said oh that's the man i talked about that's the virgin amen jeremiah ezekiel said oh that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel they knew him in his revelation but listen it was a man standing there it was king theophany the man that could give you eternal life and not just keep it all for yourself let's sing a song god bless you number three they come amen but who shall declare his generation who shall declare a generation you will they come from the land to feast with our king to dine as his guests have blessed these people [Applause] behold a glowing life then [Applause] bless partakers of his grace as james free and he set you free tonight if he has nothing don't leave this place i

they just don't know the bride has the real one you and i have the real holy of holies but they're looking for a box that god's already left that box but all he'll go back to him but he won't go back to him as a box he'll go back and say you miss me you're the one that put me on the cross but i had to blind your eyes so i could get a gentile bride and we're already gone by then all of our troubles

us to go forward now we're going to have we're going to backslide [Music] we backslide every day okay but i want us to be in prayer for the services when they come up i want us to be in prayer for even our normal regular services that come in you pray for the pastor you pray for the people that that that teach you the word of god your teachers and even you the little ones that sister rachel and some of them you know it's trying with with with younger people to get their attention you know but but the bible says raise them up according to the word of the lord and all they may do like me and just you know go out in the world but the bible says when they're older [Music] they'll return why because you give them a foundation that's why i appreciate our sunday school teachers i appreciate the ones that do that because it's a foundation amen it's a foundation even the preaching of the gospel as some we have foundations and then we have uh listen we can't all be foundation builders you'd never have a house you have to call the electrician in you have to call the plumber in you have to call the roofer in you have to call all these different ones well that's the same way with the five-fold ministry you've got these different offices that brother dale's been preaching about to put the house together because listen folks god's going to have a mature bride you can sit there just like brother brown said you can sit there tonight all night long and say the sun's not coming up in the morning the sun is not coming up in the morning and it's going to just shine sobriety in the morning because god's already said that's what's going to happen so there's going to be a bride there's going to be a mature bride you got to decide whether you want to be it or not you got to decide whether you want to put forth the effort and look at calvary first and foremost above everything look what that man did for us and then as we were talking about in brother ray's funeral that's where you got to start at but then as you start there you got you're going to come to a place that malachi 4 is going to mean something to you because god sends you elijah the prophet with the spirit of jesus christ of that same one that says believe on the lord and thou shalt be saved that same jesus is going to direct you to the true word of god he can't direct you to something false man actually overrides jesus talking to him to take a trinitarian doctrine because jesus never come to nobody said you need to be baptized in the name of father zone holy ghost he never said now you need to make sure you remember those three of us up here no but see somewhere in that communication the devil has took over and that's what we're wanting to get rid of is that gap of communication that's why the five-fold ministry that's why good deacons and elders and different ones they're they're bridging that gap to where you don't have to believe all you believe all this you don't believe all the other stuff amen young kids we're praying for you amen keep that shield up amen the devil wants you the devil don't want you more than god does but you got to want god more than the devil won't you hey man because you got to make the choice you're the one making that choice you're the one in the election you vote for jesus or you vote for the devil pretty simple so god bless you love you with the love of the lord let's bow our heads and dismiss come back together sunday remember 9 45 will be all sunday's good classes just go where you're supposed to go and then we'll have one here um after we uh brother terrence does the prayer request then i'll come up and and have a little sunday school teaching and then we'll start into the end of the service so god bless you pray that that that it won't hinder pray that it'll work pray that it'll work for the glory of the lord so let's buy our heads dear lord jesus thank you for this day thanks for the word that you've given us tonight lord we pray that you just sanctify each one of us for this journey and lord i truly pray that there won't be any gas shortage for you bride lord that we'll find gas to go do our work or come to church and do the things lord we got to start depending on you not depending on man we've got and you're doing these little things i believe you're allowing these things to happen so that you'll see that we'll see what we're depending on is man or you lord let us depend on you father whether it be from the local god that just gives you gas that doesn't matter lord any way that we can that we can come together and assemble you told us that if we assemble together where two or three are gathered in your name that there you'll be in the midst father just be with us sunday lord as we come together and we try this this different part that we're going to try lord may you be may you be the active one that does it lord and then you'll get all the praise and honor and glory for it father forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are sick thank you for the ones that are watching in listening in lord we pray that you touch their heart and bless the lord each one of us as we go to work tomorrow and do the different things lord that we have to do that you will be the center and that we'll look to calvary and know that you gave your soul not just your body you gave your soul a ransom so that you could buy us back father we thank you for that thank you for that grace that you give us lord just bless us now and take care of us in jesus name amen god bless you you're dismissed oh jesus is coming
