again yes we're gonna sing it acapella for those of you that are asleep because somebody said their brother was Ruth said that she really enjoyed brother Aaron didn't say anybody is preaching but she said she enjoyed him there making it him making everybody stand out in the middle of services happy birthday but we may do that remember by way of announcements good to make you know brother John and sister Alicia I didn't want you to go there wants you to go then want you to go obviously God didn't either so so who do the will the Lord that he'll work out something somehow and he's good brother Bobby preaching for us Wednesday night Bible studies next Saturday at 6 o'clock and what we were kind of announcing and working on and we're gonna see about doing it is the children that are eight and below somewhere in there we're gonna be showing a video in my Sunday School class on the big screen for them for entertainment because as we were talking several weeks ago about this is kind of a submarine deal we're all living in this tube you know so while we're having Bible study I know you parents want to listen to Bible study but a lot of times your kids get really loud and get distracted but they're kids they're they're kids they do what and I tell these people into when I go deliver a package and the dog starts barking and ground they said all be clapping Clyde I said it's a dog that's what he does leave him alone just keep him away from me but leave him alone but same way with kids they like to play and so we're going to take them in my Sunday School class back there in the back and and show them a vegetales or some kind of a really good eight and below movie during the time we have Bible studies so that we will be calm in that middle rooms and thank God all you are coming I mean we're having 40 and 45 people every Bible study now and that's not counting the kids so the middle yeah some of you other ones ought to try it anyway Bible study next Saturday but we will be doing that and we're going to try it for the little kids and I brought two I had a kind of a suggestion to do that so my sister and I so we'll see if we can do that with the eight and below keep their attention for a little while and and then let them the ones in the Bible study have time for Bible study so also brother Ernie I'll be here next mm-hmm not just coming weekend but the next February the night our Valentine's banquet February the 15th make sure you sign up downstairs that will be at Loretta the same place we've had it for three or four years you okay back there I told him into go out to make some noise just do something she went thank you February 23rd I'll be at brother Dutch Scots March the seventh will be the youth banquet are the youth questions and answers and then the 8th will be the Sunday that will have the youth take over the second service so just keep all that in your prayers my ways of a way of announcement brother Joey usually has them downstairs on the on the little board and they're always pretty much on line if you want to look see that also remember you know being today's my birthday so junior and I are gonna take off after second service and and we rented a cabin in the mountains so we're gonna take a couple days of R&R so we'll go up there and just we're gonna map out our next 60 years if no it won't take very long here right won't take very long we'll nap in between and then we'll get back up and do it again so thank God for a wife that stuck with me for over now eighty seventy five percent of my life she's been with me solo so thank God for that she gets all the chicks yeah I would be single probably if it wasn't for her so revival revival part six and we're going to start again in songs but we're going to we're going to talk about a an atmosphere today and we're gonna get our keep our background and then we'll get to that because some of the things that brother Brown says it's like brother Dale saying though they without us should not be made perfect there wasn't a perfection they come to a completion for their age but there never was a perfection like you and I are coming to you because they went in the ground you and I are not going in the ground we're going to become fully mature fruit and then what we're gonna do we're gonna be harvested up not down and then so just keep that in you in your heart just pray for us and Lord bless all of these Psalms 138 verse eight - Heavenly Father we thank you for this evening this afternoon you give us a time Lord set aside to speak about you we pray this you would just be with each one we were the ones Lord that are in the sanctuary here that need prayer that may be sick Lord we know that there's in our bodies there's different things that are going on and we pray that you would just give us supernatural strength Lord - to handle the pressure of the day father you told us through the Prophet that we were astronauts we're in the astronaut age so we're able to to take the pressure of the time lord but lord we pray to that as the pressure comes you said is we're going to speak in a minute that you lifted up a standard or to take care of these things and we pray Lord that you will do that in this time that we need you father more than anything in the world probably give us this day our daily bread forgive our sins be with the ones Lord that are not here that are steak the ones watching in the ones that are that are getting a little older Lord we pray that you just bless them father and give them supernatural strength father just bless the ones Lord in the foreign fields giving them fruit for their labor just give us today Lord our daily bread we ask these things in Jesus name Amen I also be praying with me I I talked to brother Keith Reed the other day and he wants me to go to Africa with him so you just pray we'll see I don't know though I walk in the midst of trouble they'll wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me the Lord will perfect that which concerning me just like I said this morning and we're starting a study on revelations and we started right there in revelations 1 you know John was so confident I want us to be so confident because John was so confident because when Jesus was on earth he said there'll be one among you that will not die until you see my kingdom coming remember then the then the the the story or the rumor went out that that Jesus was coming back before one of them was going to die well that was not what he's actually what was gonna happen but what happened was every when all of the twelve except John died a martyr's death never lived to be I think John lived to be like 96 years old so he was an old guy but he lived to go to the Isle of Patmos and John said I was on the Isle of Patmos and then God told him to take what he saw and take it to the church so see there's another promise John knew he was gonna get off the island because they want no tax no what no email had to be handwritten and had to be hand-delivered so he says what take what you see John and deliver it to the churches so you see those those are just real simple promises but I believe John took those promises is that hey I'm not gonna die until this happens what did Simeon say Simeon said the Lord has told me I'll not die until I see the Lord's Christ what kind of promise should me and you take out of the Bible that we can't die because we're in a certain time in a certain era in a certain age that we can take the promises of God and we can be as John and see not just prophesy about the coming of the Lord actually physically see because the Book of Revelations is being unfolded daily all these things that are happening in the Book of Revelations we're seeing it happen in the physical world we're living what John saw amen and remember what did John John top the entire bride so whatever he saw and done and was a part of it was what you're going through amen so the Lord bless you the Lord will perfect that which concerns me now mercy O Lord endureth forever for Satan not the works of thine own hand let's go to Psalms 85 1 turn this oh god of our salvation and cause that anger toward us to cease wilt thou be angry with us forever without draw out thine anger to all generations wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice indeed you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now let's read this first quote because it's the same prayer we've been reading but I believe it's just full of all kind of vitamins it's full of all kind of things that you and I need and if we'll just do what this one paragraph says do what this one paragraph says you'll be a lot better off amen and I hope it's creating a revival I hope some and it's going to be remember it's going to be a piecemeal revival it's going to be a word revival but it's going to what if something's gonna spark in your heart because I can't bring it see that's why if you'll understand what brother Devils been saying he said I've been in a revival for 50 years but remember according to the Prophet and according to the Bible a preacher can't bring the revival so he's been waiting all night just as God's waiting on us our pastors been waiting on us to start a revival not a whooping and hollering like we're gonna say in in a minute but but a word revival what do what the word says it's really easy but it's very hard to do what the word says God created me a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst created me Lord that which is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgiving the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press toward the mark of high calling of Christ amen so I believe that just as just as a sunday-school teacher and also just as a song leader they said an atmosphere they set a place for you to get under or get in so that you can hear from God all right then the minister has a lot less tough time bringing this message if everybody does their job down the line and then and it starts number one with and I want to tell you a revival enough in me is for sister Monica to come up to me this morning and say everybody showed up on time yeah hey hey do this and go really that's a change in anything anybody thinking oh yeah that's a change that you've made that's something you've decided to do you know why you decided cuz the door's locked that's an ultimatum but you know what sometimes God does know that right here says look in the first though I walk in the midst of trouble that will revive me thou it stretch forth thine hand the Lord will perfect that which concerning me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever for Satan up the works of thine own hand and you and I are the work of God's hands he's been waiting on us and I'll steal that quote from brother Dale he's been waiting on us adoption time work with God he's waiting on me in you you said no wait a minute well go back to brother Chris long sermon about the conflict between God and Satan there is no conflict how can you be in conflict with a creator there is no opponent but the only thing is is you standing in the middle you're the battleground he's already beat the devil according to the Bible he's already beat the devil amen and he's who is he's Victor he's he's never lost he's never lost the battle so here you are standing in the middle the greatest balance ever fought the conflict between God and Satan amen you ever thought about that you're the conflict you're the one holding this thing up you do this you're the one that's holding it up amen we like to blame Aaron we like to bring this for another let's blame herself but it will do what the word says it will it will it will have to cause a revival you can't sit still as what we're going to talk about today getting under a Holy Ghost atmosphere to where the word can because the Holy Ghost was given so the full word can work okay everybody got that I didn't bring water out here let's get me some water I'm 60 years old remember I said I'm 60 years old remember remember it gets worse Danny don't say that Sharon it's worth it so Sharon's thank goodness you showed up for my birthday I couldn't have her with us today he's always listen I love I love to see anybody so I didn't want to directly I just I just love seeing them we all feel that way so let's read now coke number two we'll get started here man that clock is pretty precise oh wait a minute Anderson that's an atomic clock okay I hope it doesn't go off maybe you'll create a little radiation in here and when you see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean we're Bible now we've been through that by just what that's just a gathering but a revival is when the people get really right with God and that's what we're gonna talk about today a Holy Ghost atmosphere will get you right with God no question that's what it was sent for was to get us in condition to hear from God and pray through and starts a revival throughout the city and everything you see they put away Sam put away their iniquity turn to God turn around and start back again in other words start down the road all right let's read number three we realize there's no new doctrine that we got to come up with listen this is a word revival of the word that is eternal that's always been there always been there the words always been there so always had power alright but brother I feel good about it anyway what this church needs today is a good revival not a new doctrine a new order just a stirring up of what you already know about all right so what was the Holy Ghost will read it in a few minutes what was it given for lead you and guide you into all truth and to what teach you things to come teach it's a teacher all right so we'll see that in just a minute so we're not looking for a new doctrine we're not looking for some we've had three or four different preachers coming here and just write on the same line of what of what's already been here so the reason you cannot tell them brother Aaron the reason that that the Liberty is is here it's because the Liberty is out there there's no question mark there's no you know you can you don't even say well I've heard it before because we had everything brother Aaron the priest we'd we'd all preached on Genesis one all the different things but it was a different angle that God came through to maybe helped you more not a different doctrine the same doctrine brought in a little different Avenue there's many ways to get to New York right but you all but you get to New York so there's many ways to bring the message to let to help you know it may help Susan one day and it may help brother Bob the different ones we can't be so narrow-minded that that you only listen to us because it gets a little mundane sometimes that's why you have a fivefold ministry five different things to be brought in and five different ways to get to New York but it's still getting in New York there was no false brought in there so and if there was you could quickly realize it like brother Dale said this point you could quickly realize it why because the Holy Ghost only feeds on the pure unadulterated I'm getting a little head of my sermon unadulterated Word of God he can't feed off of negativism he can't feed off a false doctrine there's no way God can feed off of off dr. that's just the way it is the Holy Ghost is pure and true all right now let's read number four now Minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival mmm he doesn't pack it with him and the only thing you can do is just be loyal to God and His Word and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now revival isn't adding new members to the church is reviving that what we've already got to revive means to bring back or let me say to bring things back to your memory that you've locked inside of your brain I'm sure that that when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost there was Peter James and John and then heard for three and a half years what Jesus had said and all of a sudden it was just like fireworks going off well that's why he said that well that's why he said that well that's why the scripture says that well that's why Jesus had to come it just kept firing off that's the way it's supposed to be when the Holy Ghost comes it falls on it can't fall on it can fall on ground but that grounds gotta have a seed in it to bring forth something you got to have a seed planted in the ground so we got to have the word planted that's why I believe it's just my sauce everybody's looking for the last seed the last one and they're going out to the highways and hedges I believe we ought to get everybody born again in the building first we get everybody born again in the building first then we might can go look for the last seed but the last seed could be sitting here for 10 15 20 years under sanctification and finally somebody preached a sermon and it quick and what they've got inside that's why that levinthal worker got the same amount cuz he had it Pat he had to pack in one hour he had to learn in one hour what it took them 10 hours to learn the rest of the time all right their training was really fast hey bye all right say Amen all right number five testimony on the seat then we begin to find out miracles isn't taking place in the more like we they were the Citgo homesick it isn't because of God it's because of the lack of the revival among the people there is no revival they sit and listen go home and say well I guess that was pretty good mm-hmm see there's not that zeal now we looked up that word and that word means fervor our passion we've lost maybe the passion that we had before of remember when you everybody remember when you first got born again I don't care how old you are listen we're human but when you were born the first time you were born again when you were born again you couldn't wait for the doors to open to get in church you wanted to put on a tape every time there was a gap in your time you wanted to read a book well now we've come 20 30 years down the road where's the fervor where's the passion I promise you the Holy Ghost will not go backwards can't go backwards because remember you're for combat beasts in Ezekiel and all those different ones the Bible says they never went backwards they always went forward all right so that's the way with you and I if we don't keep good we got to keep going forward but we got to realize we're maybe in a stalemate we got to realize we're maybe in a the old world word for it is in them and just a mess kind of a foggy you know how you get kind of foggy sometimes you know you work all day and you do all kind of oh your sisters doing you take care of the kids and yadda yadda yadda all these different things and sometimes you just get a little fog well why you're burdened with all the things of the world you know just step out some time and say God thank you for letting me be alive thank you for letting me live thank you for letting me take care of my husband thank you ever let me take you the kids and thank you God for saving my soul I have to do that I have to say thank you God for saving my soul you say why it's reminding God note reminded me of what he's done for me all right because we do get that brother brad says we get that weight of the world the Bible tells us we get the weight of the world on us and and we get all the different things that and you know what though we're pressurized for it we can take we're supposed to be able to take it alright number six we will see Jesus that enthusiasm the church today lost this enthusiasm why because this got out of the vine and it's no more energy being energized by the spirit that's what we're going to talk about a Holy Ghost atmosphere or an energizing wells of water bubbling up into everlasting life they've lost that zeal something's missing God remains the same Christ remains the same but his church has disassociated itself with his connection divine the spirit let me bring a little something to you real quick when you have a plant when you have a peach or pear or pecan or well anything that produces fruit the ultimate goal of that whole plant is to make sure that fruit comes to maturity okay and even in stunting the growth of the tree hear what I'm saying every bit of the life is pushed out to that outside limb where that fruit is because if that fruit doesn't mature there's nothing left for the next generation all right cuz they tell you and you know from being a beekeeper and all these different things you you see these you see a field of clover and you see all this white out there well that's good but the plant is stunted because it has put every bit of its energy into their doing making the seed so if you'll go out there and just cut it down for about two weeks two weeks from that you'll get triple a crop because you've given time to get the roots settle back again to get the to get to leave settle back again and then they'll pop up with some more fruits honey that's what God's been doing through the church ages he's we've had people come to fruition in each church age but not full fruition they had to be cut down or put into the grave because the full fruit is for this hour this is the hour that the bride tree is to produce fruit that will go up like I said and not draw down on the ground and rot and why how by listing you at by this atmosphere I don't I want to say new it's not a new atmosphere started on dead Pentecost but they didn't have enough word there wasn't enough word that's why this word revival has to come to a place of full fruition full word every word not part word not your idea or my idea it's got to be the full word just like it was when Jesus spoke it you see it can't happen I'll read you a quote in just a minute it's gonna have to happen I told you before Jesus never had a problem with his father Jesus never walked out one day in the synagogue and said when I'm in me and Daddy were fighting in the back and I was gonna tell y'all something else and he told me to tell you all this I don't believe it but I'm gonna tell you anyway now that becomes sorry wouldn't it I wouldn't want to serve a god like that I want a God that when Jesus said I only do that what the father shows me in other words what the father spoke he spoke and it was straight from the eternal that's your and mine that's our mandate for this in time right if we're gonna be as brother Dale said if the bride is going to be the son of man in the end time we have got to speak the same thing he spoke with no error you sure you can't keep it together no we can't but God can we just haven't yielded ourselves to him as much as we should let's go to joel 2:23 this is where we were talking about liens day night for those of you that weren't here right where we were gonna start speaking brother Branham was already in the spoken words original seed and he was reading he was actually quoting the quote before before I got out here so it was kind of easy Wednesday night so we're gonna go back to it just for a second read Joel 2:23 be glad then your children of Zion who's the children of Zion who's the children of line you and I we're the children the daughters of thine and rejoice in the Lord your God for have given you the former rain moderately not what is to form a rain it's mo WR eh or teaching rain now brother Browne said and I'll read it to you just a minute where rain means revival so let's read it like this and he shall give you the former revival moderately and he will cause to come down for you the revival may be revival comes from heaven down to here the former revival and the latter revival in the first month that's gonna happen real quick cuz that's right here at the end time God said two thousand years to get a bride ready but he's only got a short period of time in this life stage brother Browne said it was the shortest age but we've got to get the most word we got to get two thousand years plus we've got to get what they had in Ephesians eight but brother Brian said this message amount come forward there's two things not only restores back to that but give us something that no one has ever got before as I said last Wednesday night we hate to be exclusive but God has made us exclusive listen I don't hate only having one bride I love having only one bride I don't know what these people do with least three and four and five brides natural so God's not gonna have them spiritually he's gonna have one bride bride's brides churches brides but they'll come one all the other brides they're waiting on us to bring this thing to fruition with this last I believe that's last revival because there is no other revival the only other revival that this world is ever gonna get is when we're not here two witnesses they're gonna get a revival like you wouldn't believe but it's not to us not for us but it will be caused because it will be because we have left and we have already had our individual revival and our revival takes us up and takes us out into another two mentioned so that God can go to work with Israel and boy will they have a revival amen so more rain is teaching rain are teaching to maturity he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain the latter rain in the first month the floor shall be full of wheat and the fast shall overflow with what wine and oil what does that represent the holy goat all right and I will restore so there was a falling away there was a seed had to go into the ground we know that by the Bible even in the dark ages they're handing one go in the ground of a group of people going to ground so that Luther and Wesley and Pentecost could come back up is that right but remember they didn't have fruit oh they had fruits of the spirit but they weren't the full mature grain God wasn't looking at the Pentecostal Church and say there's my wheat there's my seed no that was shuck that was protecting what was growing on the inside that's why brother Branham says when the bride begins to say the bride the true seed word begins to say I and my father are just like that seed I only say what the father tells me to say the shuck which is already dead to life going out of it the shucks gonna pull away and you see that happening now that's not Pentecost now brother rap called the Pentecostal show and we can say that as a doctrinal wise it is Pentecost has been pulled away doctrine penticoff we're speaking in tongues and all these other things or you got to come to my church you got to believe my doctrine that's just as Pentecostal as it was when somebody stood in 40 years ago and said you got speaking tongues out of the Holy Ghost that same devil standing behind a pulpit saying if you don't come to this church you don't listen to my message if you don't believe when I'm preached that's the same devil same devil listen I'm not trying to narrow this thing down God is narrowing it down that thing gets more narrow as we get to the headship it's only for a certain group and they all got to be alive it can't be dead the floor shall be full of wheat in the fat shall overflow wine oil and I will restore to who you he's still talking about the children of thine I will restore to you the years the two thousand years go to the seals folks go to the seals and put this in the seals the four horse riders locus cankerworm pommel worm caterpillar four horsemen they eat the word down the false vine but thank God he's given us a promise I will restore it to you so he's not gonna restore the world he's not gonna restore the denomination's how you can't they have no foundation they have no foundation to restore from what this foundation was a pure Holy Ghost atmosphere foundation for God to stack all the promises on top of it there's a standard been raised and we'll read in just a second and you shall eat implanting listen guys we got a seven course meal it's the books open John didn't pick and choose a salad and his dessert in Revelation is 10 to eat the whole book he didn't leave any of it laying down on the ground heat the whole thing you disappeared were to disappear in John so where's the book today by the baptism of Holy Ghost system it's disappeared in you so what you do you eat the word and brother Brown said the Holy Ghost inside of you is waiting for you to bring the word faith doesn't come by eating it comes by hearing so you got to hear it this is where it's got to go first it's got to be what faith cometh by hearing but then what do we do we eat it we eat the book we might have to do like the cows do you what go cows out in Terrance's pasture you know they'll they'll walk around and they'll eat for two hours and never raise her head then they'll go over and lay down somewhere they'll go what they're bringing it back up and eating it again that's called a room and airy they have 5 stomachs if you want to know what all that is they keep it there and that's what you know that's what we're doing we keep it in there and then when a preacher comes like brother Aaron or brother Dale and different ones that preach here what do they do they bring back to your remembrance what you've already heard and then what do you do you chew on it a little bit more and then it becomes part of you but thank God for that Isaiah 59 19 let's move on so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and its glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up or revive a standard against him a standard away an atmosphere it's already there how do you fight water with water fight water with water it's like I said before Jesus told us it if you if you were the light you can't be put out what puts you out is is you're not the light and you look at it and it blinds you but we can't be blinded the bride type of the moon but thank God he put it in the Bible this supernatural happening that the Moon is going to be seven times brighter moon is who the bride we're gonna be seven times higher hotter brighter in this age because the Bible tells us the Bible says if that lighting you be darkness you think it's light those people think it's like maybe some people sitting in here think you've got all the light in the world and if you think it's light and it's not it's the greatest darkness that will ever be is to walk in like brother Brown said about being blind rich and miserable and naked but the board and I were talking like this a few minutes ago they that's the denominational people they were so blinded they have zero clothes on the program said that's insanity if you see somebody with no clothes on walking down the street blind wretched and miserable naked and don't know it now to know it is different but to not know it and think you're fully clothed well I'm going in because I'm a Baptist you're naked you have nothing to cover you with that's horrible but thank God he give us a standard he gave us a standard to go by and we can always go by it will never change it's not this way in this time in this way no no it's always been the Word of God alright let's read right here in Hosea come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us now there's you promise in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord and his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain or as the revival as the latter and former revival unto the earth so now we've had the teaching rain we've been under this teaching rain for all this time now the latter rain is didn't falling brother branham's time he told him it wasn't going to fall he told them nonsense you haven't had the former yet but we're living folks we're not living now sure there is a former rain as far as your teaching but we got it there's gonna be a time when it's got to come to me that fruit right here not to not the bark not to leave not to not the SAP not it it's got to be that fruit that original fruit that made the tree I mean look you can graph the our engine an apple or an orange and a lemon tree and it'll grow but you can't take that orange seed plant it right there were and think you're gonna get lemons you're not you're gonna get oranges cuz it's the life is what's in the tree we've got to get back to the original life the original life its original seed the original word is what I believe stand up on your feet we're gonna sing that song the original live the original scene the original word hey y'all made it thirty minutes what I believe the son of mine is reveal the Seventh Seal is unveil the original I the original see for some yellow just woke up the original the original see the original words don't be fun it's what I believe the Son of Man is revealed the Seventh Seal isn't them the original the original seen you can be seated that wasn't in my notes after two days after thirty minutes we're gonna revive again better now yeah all right let's read number seven broken cistern it don't need no filter no strainer no pumping no jerking no nothing's talked about that little that little bubbling brook that he came upon there in the woods it's just dire bubbling up it don't have to depend on local rains to fill it up rains or revivals where that fountain that's at that fountain of life where the carcass is the Eagles will gather we don't have to pump up a revival you don't have to pump up nothing only thing you have to do is just come to it it's always full of good fresh water and there is no end to it it just keeps on bubbling number eight that's the way you get a revivalist when you really get in the spirit of revival now we're talking about going to get an atmosphere we're talking about getting in the spirit of something all right people get in the spirit of different things road rage is one ball games and all these different things they get there's a spirit involved with that all right so we're gonna get in the spirit of revival Lord bring back to my memory what I've already heard and then teach me things to come then help me Lord how many times you listen here's a real good teaching moment if you're sitting there today or any other day and a preacher is up here preaching and you say I don't understand that have you ever stopped and just said lord I don't understand what that meant saying please somewhere reveal it to me he will have to do it don't go away and say I can't understand it in three days later say I can't understand it in ten days the Holy Ghost is not listening I'm not gonna say in this that the Holy Ghost is not dumb the Holy Ghost is extremely godly intelligent and if you have him inside of you he's got to do what he said he's got to bring you the truth not whooping it up or something but by praying it down where does water come from comes down where the revival come comes down on you until there's a revival start strikes your heart into all the logs of Ecclesiastes and blogs of families fanaticism all the logs of systems logs of unbelief flow out then the water of God comes falling down upon you there you are that's why the that's why they dream such a shepherd's dream what was it it was water water coming down into the box and what was coming out trash trash it was having a revival I'll guarantee you I'll promise you you'll have a revival if you'll start getting the trash out name whatever the tranche is doesn't matter just name it because we all got it my trash god picks up on Monday I tried to get him out on Sunday my trash that didn't go over well anyway my natural trash goes out on Monday I try to get my trash out on Sunday let me say it one more time I'm done but look that's the way you get a revival by praying it down the waters of God comes falling down upon you there you are listen it brother bored we were talking about baptism now we believe in water baptism not sprinkle aim because sprinkling may not hit a spot but me and brother Dale when we baptize you we try not to leave not one dry place on you because they might be a spot for the devil to get but when we put you in that icy water because I promise you if they bury you out here in the in a cemetery they're not gonna bury you with a hand sticking up they gonna make sure you six foot under we're gonna make sure that the old you is gone we have done what we what God told us to do now it's time for you to do what you're supposed to do but baptize if the water comes flowing down upon you there you are now look we're gonna go to number nine and I want to probably next Sunday still under I was gonna finish today we revival but something struck me yesterday once you start thinking about this now the power of God wake up the power of God will do this every five minutes we'll never get finished the power of God never changes it's just this constant it's more constant than anything it's constant the power of God is there and brother Graham said is to create a world and go live on it if you if you weren't what if it wasn't Harvard or bard in you you could create a world and go live one cut why cut the Creator the one who stood one day and said let there be he's inside of you if you're born again all right but something had to change the power didn't change the Holy Ghost didn't change nobody got that same em so there had to be somewhere a transfer of power we're gonna speak on that maybe next Sunday because there had to be a transfer cause remember this man that what brother Aaron was talking about and what in the beginning there's this all-powerful all-knowing all-seeing eternal being standing where there's nothing and when he says let there be this thing we're standing on is created what a power but he didn't want to keep it he did not want to keep that power if you kept that power he'd be hello him he'd be self-existing which he still was but he's not stuff existing anymore why he chose not to be you believe God makes choices I do brother Brown said he had a plan and a purpose he chose a plan and guess why it's perfect it's a perfect plan this couldn't happen no other way that's why I rest on whether I look at things and I go what in the world God made it this way we just have to attach ourselves to that plan all right everybody got that so there's a transfer but we'll talk about that in the Sunday but watch what happens during the time I read this look at verse looking up verse 9 look at the quote number nine on the third seal now that's the reason today because remember we went when we first started this we went through revivals this one had a revival Wesley luther Sankey Calvin Finney all those had revivals and there was a cycle of that revival and it was good for the time it was good for the time but it wasn't the full mature fruit time it was the Holy Ghost to do it but something had it funneled down or narrowed and what was that man's ideas but we'll look at that in just a second the right now what's the reason today that the revivals that were supposed to have that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring Lord that's 1963 that's been the seal is open he's been through the greatest campaign of healing that ever struck the face of the earth and he said we're in the wrong revival that's reason they the revivals that were supposed to have dot dot dot he stops we have because I believe he picked up their thought and he stuff well we've had denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't now why cuz it's 1963 the seals is broke he's moving over into another revival he's moving into that second phase of Malachi for that number one to restore the restores back to the faith of the fathers now he's moving into another revival bringing another not another word not another word not outside the Bible he's bringing lights on what's already there because we remember a revival it's not bringing a brand-new book per se words but a brand new way to look at it everybody got that same in so watch don't think we have revivals we haven't we have it all we got millions and millions of church members remember they come up with a slogan million more than 44 and all these different things but not a revival nowhere now look listen to me just a second they weren't they weren't revivals that didn't bring results they were people born again under those revivals mooney Sankey Feeny Calvin Hall there was people born again that were bribed but there were not what he's talking about not what he's talking about full fruition to the fruit aisle at the end of the out at the end of the branch but not a revival nowhere no no now if stopped it right there we'd be in trouble but he said the bride the bride hasn't had a revival yet remember in the in the sealed book he finally steps out one day and says I now call you bride he had separated the church from the bride because there is a difference the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it so whatever he promised right it's here whatever it is you want to think it's here he promised it something had to change there had to be a transfer of power from being it's okay me and brother but what was talking to men ago about God winking at the ignorance of men because the Holy Ghost never never developed a father son Holy Ghost baptism brother brems didn't come from the pits of hell Wow but God winked at the ignorance of man and let him do it down through the church ages and let him keep doing it Wesley was a Trinitarian baptized father son Holy Ghost he's a bride I told you a long time ago when we get to the new city there's only going to be a small microcosm of people that are born that were baptized the right way maybe the first two Church ages and half of the third and our age that's it everybody else is going to come under follow us and hold those why God winked at the ignorance of that way of baptism but he never the hot seat so look so the Holy Ghost couldn't work in that area I hope you get what I'm saying the Holy Ghost could not work in a false baptism but he went that the ignorance of man just enough to get them what in the bride tree but not the full fruit something had to change though from the administration of coming out to where Brenda Brown said I this our God through the Prophet said this it's what it is you don't baptize in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost no more that thing come from Hell that doctrine because it didn't come from God there's only two places there's only two powers really the devil don't have any God gives it to him power was given power was given power was given you know who gives you the power everybody take your hand raise it up cuz that's the person that gives it to him sadly to say but you know what we're coming into something though we're coming into something you say something different brother wait I don't like to use that word different but it is different than what people have seen before it is different than what a denomination it is even different for what people that come up in the first part of the message it is it's a transfer of power alright listen number 10 but that's the way God does he he humiliates us in our educational system not as I'm trying to support ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the difference education can never bring life it takes the Spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just an intellectual revival it's got to come out of the Bible word revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and look when it falls falls rain when it falls the day and quickens you get the same results as you did in acts 2 it always has it always will be because it's the Spirit of God look that conditions the atmosphere Wow now atmosphere is all the way around the world I believe he's talking about your atmosphere the one you create the atmosphere you create brother brems did you create an atmosphere but let me ask you a question do you create a holy spirit atmosphere do we create a holy spirit atmosphere but it's got to come out of the Bible it's got um it's going to be a word revival that words the saint will not fail and when it falls or when it rains or when we get start this revival and it quickens what does it do let me just give me an example you look at yourself and going through your Christian this parish there's a lot of things that you didn't understand when you first got born again right but now you had the full Holy Ghost inside of you you didn't have just what while they got the know you got the Holy Ghost you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got God taking out the old nature putting his nature in and there you are cleans you up kills the old you not your soul not just soul or you're dead but he cleans it out listen in sanctification you ought to know what God does the unclean spirit goes out of a man but if you'll put the Holy Spirit in nothing else to get back in remember the one sealed up when you get pregnant sisters what happens you own cells up can't take anything else same way with God when God comes in and plants the seed word and it quickens and starts coming to life nothing else can get in that soul but it's that old spirit guy that we got to deal with and that's what we're dealing with now because we're we're not just now bringing our soul under a Holy Spirit atmosphere could it loves the word listen if you've got the baptismal though it is the word it's not a different word it is the word the same one that said let there be light it's now residing in your soul brother Brown says you and him in there as a person amen could you still got the outside got to deal with sorry we still got the outside got to deal with but we need to put it under a Holy Ghost atmosphere so that this revival because it's a word revival word has to compare with word all right everybody got that same man now listen now watch this right here pergamene church age number 11 how can you tell the spirits apart just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one whoa brother branham come on now I'm just telling you what he's there my brother Aaron said we need to separate ourselves from evil God told us to separate ourselves a total separation from unbelief all right as the evil one deceived the first two Brides he will try to deceive the bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creed's are just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her everybody got that say ma'am watch this wake up listen but God never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when Elijah told the woman to bake him a cake first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said that's why sometimes we look around we wonder why God's not what not giving us signs well are we in the word when she did as the word said the proper son came huh come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit energized atmosphere is energized it you know you look at these places and you if you ever watch a go to a sporting event or something I'm I've been to a thumb and the most y'all have to but there's an energy there why they create an atmosphere they want to win and they'll rip their shirts off for 12 degrees below zero and paint their favorite football team on their chest and we think they're crazy they're anointed they're energized by the spirit that's inside of them now I'm not advocating any of y'all doing that we can be civilized and still be energized okay but it would help every once in a while somebody go thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord some of y'all ought to try that sometime the seed word is energized by the spirit I wrote myself a note this is where I take all energy in the plant it's put to getting the fruit out not to grow more no you prune limbs remember the Bible even tells the pruner goes in and prunes what dead limbs are the suckers that we have in our life because you won't every bit of that energy to go toward that apple or orange or whatever fruit that you're gonna listen I've learned this with the apple tree in the plum tree you can say oh man the more limbs the more the more the more that ain't right even the Bible tells you all right you got to go in and prune it if it proves that if you prune it it brings more fruit why the energy to make them limbs are cut off and then that energy is diverted to what make a bigger apple make a bigger fruit make a bigger whatever you got that same way with God we all got suckers in our life don't look over to your husband Susan did that's why I said that but if we get rid of the suckers listen the whole energy of God what he did from when he stood and said let there be light his whole intention was this hour right here if the Bible said that all prophets look to this day Jesus pointed to this day John pointed this day everything in the Bible is pointing to right now well where is his energy now the energy to produce this fruit is in every bit of you jesus said in John 14 I'll if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the Father and we're gonna have an argument no he said I will pray the father and he shall gladly give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever listen to this even the Spirit of Truth not error whom the world cannot receive see there's an exclusive right there we're an exclusive group of people whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not or may I say understand this him not because we don't physically see Jesus we see men as people we see his works we see the things he does right that's why Jesus stood one day and said the world is gonna not gonna see me anymore but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age all right whom the world cannot receive now that we got to have a Holy Ghost atmosphere because it says him not neither knoweth him in other words have an intimate relationship with him and bring all things to your remembrance there's you promise bring all things to your remembrance but the comforter that right you got it which is the whole it let's go back up to verse 17 I mean verse 17 of John 14 I skipped that and sorry go back to there I'm not finished with that one even the Spirit of Truth you're fine whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you how you gonna lose John 14 25 it a little bit further he keeps saying these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name that's why that that quickened in Peters brain he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins for you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because it's in his name if we never get people to see the name father's not a name Sons on her name Holy Ghost is not a name it's a title to the name Jesus Christ our Lord we don't just baptize cold acts 2:38 says - where'd that come from if you ever get a revelation of the name you'll have to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man whether it was in whether it was in there or not but he's plainly in there Peter said I've heard him say in John 14 of course it was written it's time but Peter says I heard him say whom the father will send in my name will then brothers and sisters we got to get baptized in that name and that's exactly what Jesus was saying he was saying something different he said baptized in my name what is the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you then that wasn't just a promise for the first church age to me old man the message since brother Branham was alive that's good you should have a lot of memory and this holy ghost person said he'll bring that all back to your memory you say I have a hard problem with that brother way check up time maybe you don't have the whole go and like brother Dale said if you if you decide or realize you don't have it you're sitting in a good place to get it cuz I just told you the promise repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ with the mission says and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for what this promise that's the promise brother Dale was online this morning that's in the Bible they didn't receive the promise what is the promise the promise is unto you the promise of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Greek lexicon watch what it says right here about the comforter will be finished right here real quick I may not get them all but we'll get the rest of it next Sunday Parakletos are an advocate one who pleads and others calls before a judge a Pleader counsel for the defense legal assistant an advocate one who pleads another's cause you know it was wonderful that God sent us a prophet to tell us that Jesus is the is the defense lawyer he's the attorney he's the judge he's the Advocate he's the jury how can you lose how can you lose it's good to know somebody walked into place myself with my young son standing back yonder sitting back under and it was good to have all Jerry Riley standing right there with her because you know what daddy saved his life when he was located from drowning and he was a solicitor general the whole county and I felt pretty good I had some prestige beside me but what about the King of glory inside of you not beside you that man's inside of you that advocate is inside the one who pleads and others cause with one an intercessor so if Christ in is the exaltation to God's right hand pleading with God the Father for the pardon of our sins now watch this one in the widest sense the helper Itzik or an aider an assistant so if the Holy Spirit destined to take the place of Christ with the Apostles and he was because Jesus said I'll go away and I'm gonna send you a comforter I'm going away in my body for I'm going away but I'm coming back I'm not gonna leave you comfortless I'm not gonna leave you alone I'm gonna send you some help I like what this says here after his ascension to the Father to lead them who the Apostles so if the whole show of the Holy Spirit destined to take the place of Christ with the Apostles to lead them to a deeper knowledge of the gospel truth and give them divine strength needed to enable them to undergo trials and persecutions on behalf of the divine kingdom that's what you and I have to have the Holy Ghost every day to overcome every day every day but being a full word revival what's this John 16 Saint John 16 verse 12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you can't bear them now what you can't bear them now I got a lot to say to you but I'm gonna just wait and I'm gonna tell them in a different way I'm not gonna be here anymore but I'm gonna send somebody that's going to reside in you and then if you start when you start hearing hearing the Word of God it's going to quicken what you have howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth there has never been a false doctrine come from God never have been a false doctrine come from God it's always come from the devil God Kame bring the fox doctor he attains nothing fault in him for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come show you revelation but remember they all had the right Holy Ghost there's not a wrong Holy Ghost since the day of Pentecost there's been the right Holy Ghost fall on the people amen but it's not been in the full word revival until today because God had to work through a narrow path especially in the dark ages brother Graham said it was just death for you to say you believed in the Lord Jesus Christ right then you come up into Luther well now Luther was Luther was a mostly all Catholic even when he got converted he ought to kill the Jews he smoked pipe great now the Holy Ghost didn't work in that the Holy Ghost can tell you to go smoke a pipe and drink a beer that was Luther but he had a word that says the just shall live by faith that was a narrow place that God had to work but it was the real Holy Ghost that was working through there then it got a little bit bigger with Wesley the stream got a little bit bigger then Pentecost the stream got just a little bit bigger same Holy Ghost but they only had a certain amount of word to work through you and I don't have that excuse God cannot and will not wink at our ignorance now listen to this quote right here real quick and we'll we'll be finished we got to get out of here go rest a little bit enjoyed yourself today I have being in church I enjoy myself anyway seeing you number 12 let's look at spoken words original seed we just heard this message Adams bride rejected to bring life she brought death we're her product our bodies this is a product of Satan and Eve this is we all die look at us you can see Jehovah's bride died he divorced her spiritually and he took the people out of the Gentiles for his name is that right his name like a woman takes a man's name the bride now what she done the same thing they did the other time denominated herself polluted here's my point but in every generation every revival brings forth some prophet of God so as this last revival this is it for us there had to be a prophet come on the scene at this revival time to bring what bring the pure word revival not a sinking not a fini not a moody they were fine took people in the kingdom but they were all Trinitarians everyone I'm work so there's that part of God that he can't work in he can only work in pure unadulterated word I'll read it to you right here in just a second but in every generation every revival brings forth some prophet of God a prophet is a preacher true preacher on the word that stays with the word and they bring forth the revival that gathers that elect out of that generation but now watch then she goes into seed then God will never use it again not not full word seed denominational see because this hybridized that can't come back up again I ask any theologian any historian to tell me one time that the denomination ever rose up she never did she died when she denominated and there's where she laid let's go to endtime seed sign number thirteen but in the face of all that there is a real bride that God is bringing forth and has a little bit out of each each time there's been a Reformation there's been so much looks much of the word spread forth not all of it so much of the word spread forth and each generation gets its time did you ever notice there'll be a man of God come along that will strike fire with God and there'll be a great revival sweep the lamb and what happens immediately after that they take that man's idea and denominated brother brother said you won't denominator this message but they'll organize it in the letters see that's what they're doing now immediately after that they take that man's ideas and denominator and bring in Creed's and mix with it there she dies and never rises again always has been always will be every time but each generation what does it get look at this its opportunity at the fresh word of God fresh word of God each time like Lutheran and justification that was fresh they've never been preached before that was fresh started a revival then Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostals move under the baptism of the Holy Spirit see each one gets its chance then what does the men do that follows those great reformers denominated organize it mix it with Creed's mix in Creed's with it a little bit hearing a little bit layer a new bunch of school scholars comes along with a bunch of psychology just the same as the Eve was trying to find some new light that's why we're not this revivals not trying to find some new light we need to revive the light we got mix it up with the word of God death her ideas with the word of guns death a way with the organization and died spiritually that's exactly right that's the way it always always been till God had to send us a prophet not like any of the other prophets this is the end time prophet this prophet preached the message to get us to that full mature a shanaar maturing of the fruit everybody got that say man all right let's go to number 14 we'll get finished with this a couple more quotes that all right look God in his body Christ what we're going to talk about transfer power next Sunday God in his body Christ Christ in his body the bride oh my god made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and it's bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed no sir but she is coming back with the pure don't tell us we can't do this don't tell us we can't do this I'm talking about all of us don't tell us we can't do this don't tell us we can't get this thing right she's coming back with the pure unadulterated Word of God being manifested I hope that every man that hears this tape and every woman will start a revival will understand it because if you understand it it will start a revival she is the second Eve but she is not breaking and spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband she'll stay with his word regardless of what anybody says you can have all the ecumenical moves you want to and all the affiliations I belong to this one I listen to this one online and I that's all right Pfister pure unadulterated word but it just makes you feel good and don't make you live right it's worthless number 15 this is one I wanted to get to right here in town seed seats on priests in Tifton Georgia right here down south then I mean that's the south as you can get without going to Florida but watch what he says and I believe that these latter days signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together to show that Christ is ready to come for his bride listen to this as God in his word no become by a word revival as God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man who's he talking about Christ so is God and His Word coming again and making himself manifested in a bride not will do like Eve did highbreed it to something else but the unadulterated Word of God will be born into that church I'll clap that's mean you and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did coalmine do what with his spirit anointing in his word amen I believe it's the announcement now 1962 March the 19th brother Branham was announcing that something there was a shifting of power coming right here amen I believe it's the announcement now now what did brother Branham do he he came to give us the pure unadulterated Word of God apart from any Creed apart from anything that anybody can say out there in the denominational world this is the ministry of Jesus Christ just like it was three and a half years of when he was alive if it's not then it's false Luther had part of it sure Wesley had part of it but they could no one preach the pure unadulterated word like this prophet in the end time because that was the anointing that was on that prophet and this end time to what give us a Holy Ghost atmosphere to get us out of here not to put us in the grave let me prove that let's go to job 33 this is one of my favorite scriptures we read a long time ago but I want you to see how what job taught about this job dirty job 33:23 if there'd be a messenger what Joe was looking for somebody that's Lee this is our Hugh talking to job and Elihu is who Christ if there be a messenger with him and interpreter what among a thousand I say one among a million ten million to show unto man his uprightness listen brother Brahm came to condemn the people that turned his message down but he came to tell me and you that we're perfect show unto man his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and says deliver him from going down to the pit I have found that word if you look in your Scofield Bible that word ransom means atonement I have found
