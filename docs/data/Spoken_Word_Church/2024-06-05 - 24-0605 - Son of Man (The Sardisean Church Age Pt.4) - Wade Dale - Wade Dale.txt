sisters and brothers for for cooking and taking care of the trash and and um and doing all the things you need to do that I know some of you new ones here don't know brother Richard and brother uh Harris they had U they had went on and started their own churches when some of y'all before yall some of y'all got here but that preaching you heard Sunday is a kind of preaching I grew up with so if that stumbled you guess what about another month or two you going to get same thing cuz I'm coming with it when we start on that when we start on that last Church age when we get into the son of man ministry that's what you're going to hear you're going to hear about the third pool you're going to hear about these different things you're going to hear about adoption headship and all these things you're going to hear about all that all right so that's what's coming that look okay black screen behind or you'd rather have white because I don't know how it got the black so so we'll just we'll just keep it there Josh I don't know what happened but huh is that okay if that's not all right let me know cuz I'm going to leave it there that okay okay all right well we'll leave it there then praise the Lord good to be in the house of the Lord but again thank y'all so much for this weekend it meant a whole whole lot to me um seeing them back again that I was raised with Brother Richard Brother Richard was was kind of like my second dad when we first came in message in 1968 I think we met Brother Richard and them after we had started this church so it was probably 72 73 him and brother Woodby his brother-in-law was a a pastor of the church there where brother Andre is now in Irwin and we made many many trips there and they made many many trips here and uh the preaching like you heard Sunday that's the kind of preaching we grew up with so um it's powerful it's it's I was listening to a brother uh brother Chad Lamb um yesterday and he he said it's easy but it's hard it's simple but it's complicated it's what you make out of it if you want the complicated to become simple ask God cuz he said he never he's not going to confuse us the only confusion is as devil gets involved and says oh you can't really understand that well listen if brother Brandon preached it if it's on tape then we're privileged to it and we're privileged to preach it and he said he preached a big nugget so that we can break it down into little nuggets so we can really understand the word of God and I sure appreciate those two brothers we're going to get brother Harris to come preach for us in a couple of months and also brother Steven Wilson his brother Richard son is a mighty good preacher too so um I appreciate them U coming and doing what they did and U I hope you enjoyed it cuz I sure did St Augustine said faith is to believe what you do not see the reward for this faith is to see what you believe faith is to believe what you do not see the reward of this faith is to see what you believe think about that Amen brother Lise remember them I think they've already landed in Canada or they're getting close and brother Michael and sister Nyla will be with them this Sunday will'll be communion in foot washing brother Luis will be gone for a little while we stopped by to see brother Donnie he's doing a lot better and uh he was up out of the bed and into a chair so just uh if you go talk to him just don't tell a lot of jokes don't get make me laugh cuz with eight broke ribs ain't fun but remember that brother Daryl W to be here in a couple of weeks and remember that the sisters are getting ready for the Saturday meal also remember that we've got the July meeting coming up and also now downstairs there's a sign up sheet if you want want to go to brother uh Andre's it'll be the Friday Saturday and Sunday just like it was last year for all of y'all that went it'll be the exact same format it'll be youth service on Saturday brother um Brown Joel Brown will be preaching for us same just like did last last year and then I'll be doing a service at brother Andre's on Sunday so and we will call off Services here so we will not have service here we'll probably just live stream so from there to to your home if you if you can't go but I really really would appreciate if all of you would go we had a real good time last year got to meet a lot of um a lot of new people that come to church there since we had visited with them so we sure appreciate brother Andre we love his ministry too he's preaching for us October the 6th he'll be with us on that day June's doing a lot better we took her to the doctor today and doctor said go for it you know just just go for it slow all right we get older that's what you do anyway you go for it you just go for it a little bit slower than you used to but just remember in prayer and all these ones that are sick so I think that's got all the announcements I got one scribbled down here and I can't remember what it is so um let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this evening you've give us thank you for a group of people that that long to hear from you Lord not from a a certain individual or a favorite preacher but Lord to hear straight from you father that it go soul to soul your your soul is going to be preached tonight if if it's the truth Lord and it goes to the to the people here sitting today and the ones out on the internet and Lord I pray that that would sink deep into our hearts Lord that we'll understand Lord more about you the as the song says understand it better by and by well the way we're going to understand it is we can't be sitting at home we got to be listening studying doing due diligence coming to church doing the things we're supposed to do and then we will as Brother Richard said we're going to take a Rapture one day and I believe we're part of those that group of people there's not another group coming this is it so father just be with us forgive us of our sins and bless in Jesus name amen all right sard Ean Church age we might get to it tonight part four let's read Revelations 1 through 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day it doesn't look good over on this side but is it okay over there oh that's cuz of a glare okay saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send into the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus th Sardis Philadelphia and L out of sin Let me just add something real quick as Brother Richard was talking this weekend we're in the we're in the open book we know that right all right we're in the open book age we're in the book where the lamb takes the book and he breaks the seals well now the lamb is there to speak to these groups of people Ephesus all all the way through but as Brother Richard was saying they don't get the son of man Revelation like we do all right now we've been over Son of God Son of Man son of David we'll go over it again but the Son of God is the Holy Ghost that's what I've been preaching for the past through all the church ages all you're going to see is a Son of God all right that's all you're going to see is the Son of God working in a group of people amen don't get quiet it's just Wednesday night but the headstone was rejected Ed and was taken off the scene and by the by the slight of the devil he corrupted the word so much through denominational ideas we'll read it today till he called her the great and the great had harlots God hates that thing he hates it but he allowed somebody like Martin Luther to come up in it we'll look at that in just a minute but these are working under get Born Again live a good Christian Life do do the things that a messenger under their messenger and then die and wait in the sixth Dimension but now you and I and Lea we've been called out of that age and you and I are in a different time if you're in Leia you're still in time but if you are born again tonight you have been caught up out of Leota and you are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now listen don't say that to your flesh say that to that guy that's on the inside I'm sitting in Heavenly places tonight I'm exactly where I want to be maybe y or not and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks which are The Seven Ages and when he looked he looked one like unto the son of man which was what the son of man is God in a human flesh now remember the Son of God is a spirit God it still is this theophany it who God is but he's revealing himself in a different way he's allowing Martin Luther under that Son of God Revelation to be able to to preach a father son Holy Ghost baptism to preach that there's an eternal hell to preach the he's allowing that to happen why because he said the corn of wheat's got to fall on the ground and then it's got to come back to the original as Brother Richard was talking about the Alpha and Omega the book ends the son of man the son of man closed out the Old Testament son of man's got to close out the new test which is standing here today there is no other way no other form he's going to be in all right and in the midst of the seven candle sticks one liken the son of man clothed with the Garment down to the foot and gird back the PS with the golden girdle you can be seated the Lord as his Blessing to the reading the word now let's read about Sardis and then we'll back up just a minute because I want to cover something until the angel of the Church of Sardis write these things sayith he that has the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name look thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead all right is everybody with me all right Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found th found thy works perfect before God in other words coming out of this into this church age there's going to be doctrines that God a going to like but as brother R said he winked at their ignorance that there wasn't enough word for them to get out of that cuz remember we're going to read in Revelations where the Bible tells us to come out of her who's her who's her you got to know where you come out of to make sure you're separated from it so her is the great the great had harlot's denominations sorry but that's the truth all right I I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead listen father son Holy Ghost is not names they're titles to a name that baptism is false it's not even in the Bible you say oh yeah it is Jesus said it he was telling us how to do it cuz Peter did exactly what Jesus said right cuz he had the keys to the kingdom right for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent now here he is again every Church age God says you're doing this wrong repent you're doing this wrong repent if you'll do this I'll do this so repentance means a lot if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled my name a few names in Sardis there was a group of people that still believed that the Lord Jesus Christ was the name of almighty God not the second person of a trinity which is not even in the Bible has anybody read that n in book Nia book Nia nian counsel if you hadn't I'll give you the book and you can read it but we going to check it out like a library book and I'm going to charge you if you don't get it back in a month or two my daddy a long time ago he said don't ever give somebody a book and they tell you they're going to give it back usually they don't they have a few names even in start which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with men white for they are worthy there is a bride in every Church age doesn't matter how bad it is doesn't matter how bad it looks how dark it looks there is a group of people that takes the message of the hour and lives it he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment well there you go and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life CU we're going to read about that in just for a second but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath near let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches so real quick here's the here's the chart and you're going to see part of it but we're going to get right here to Luther that's where we're at the sardian church age went from 1520 to 1750 and during that time from from 1520 to 1906 which is the man anointing according to the Bible we'll read that in just a minute right there is your uh heading into 190 six is you're an industrial age but all the print and presses and all the things I got a whole list of things steam turbine telescopes thermometers knitting machines Water Wheels pocket watches microscope submarines believe that adding machines pressure cookers pianis steam engine dictionary steam ship bifocal glasses thank God parachutes bicycles gas lighting cotton genin small poox vaccine batteries Tesla really appreciated that but the first print press was in that was put together the first print and press that was that was I guess used was in 1440 but it was very crude and and and horribly built but in 1634 which is about what in the middle of the sardian church age 1634 the first PR and press started producing written letters and and paper and um newspapers I guess you might say and things like that was in 1634 so this is considered the man age which is the intelligence man is intelligent all right it's the intelligence but it's also remember the intelligence of God the intelligence of God comes first and then what happens is man man perverts it always but from Columba we're going to look at it back in just a second Columba to Luther the the the 16006 606 to 1520 was 900 years of nothing but horrible Catholic rule 68 million Christians were killed according to the Catholic Church they said that so this is not hearsay this is not something that we had to get from a prophet it was in a book form already all right because they killed people by not believing their Doctrine okay all right thereby with me so that was a time of of of Darkness that was never before it was called the Dark Ages so let's look right back just for a second in the th tyan church I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and patience and thy Works he keeps talking about about works the last to be more than the first and I will kill her children with death now who's he talking about let's back up here a minute we've been studying this for a couple weeks who is that her that's any church idea contrary to the word of God and God's going to kill her by her own words by her own if she takes on a false Doctrine which is death he's going to let her die remember the Bible tells us that God's going to give a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by God knows that it doesn't matter now this is something that you got to realize when you talk about predestination and and for knowledge we know for a fact forn knowledge comes first and we know that everybody in this building and all over the world has a choice because we are a free moral agent everybody with me but by for knowledge God being so knowledgeable for knowledge before this ever began he knew that if he'd give Hitler if he'd give any of these people uh Constantine he gave them a million years to live he knew that they would never come to repentance so therefore he doesn't have to put them in a book he can put them in a different place and he can also let them kill theirself amen they took on a doctrine that killed them but the doctrine was death to begin with with that's why we got to get our Doctrine right that's why God had to send a prophet in the end time to get this thing straighten back out to get the right baptism to get the right way to receive the Holy Ghost to get the right way of of believing there's no eternal hell and all these different things that was contrary to the word of God and I will kill her children with death and all the churches see churches children listen her as a church everybody with me her I will kill her and her children we're going to read this in just a minute Book of Revelations but he's going to give you uh your reward according to your works and he that overcometh and keepeth my works there's got to be a works that we look in the Bible and see that there's a works of God that we've got to do that he's already set the Precedence we got to do it right it's not guessing it's not maybe it's a fact it's written in the Bible and brother Richard said this is all we got to go on this is it right here if anything comes outside of this Bible it's wrong amen and it's what it's death so cuz what you think that you're reading if it's contrary to the word of God that wrote it it's death because many people will read a father son Holy Ghost baptism because they said that's what Jesus said well you got to look by Revelation he said in the name father's not a name son's not a name Holy Ghost is not a name there is a name behind that and it's connected to my new birth I don't know about yours but mine I'm connected to a family called Dale not by father my name's Wade not son cuz if you say son we got there sons all in this place but when you say brother way Dale who do you look at you look at me so when we say n we're going to baptize in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost we're doing exactly what Jesus said we're we put a name to it because the Bible says every family in Heaven and Earth got one name Jesus Christ that's Bible so the ox AG is an age of works just to get right through that but let's look at this real quick I inserted this June asked me we're going to get actually going to get into sardian church age I said yes sweetheart we will and until I sat in there and pulled out about four more quotes and three more scriptures so we may not but we'll get to it sometime but the reason I want you to see this is the reason I'm backing up into this into this tharan church age look what Martin Luther came out of he came out of a soup of tar pitched devil darkness that rued for not 9 years not 20 years not 200 years it Ru for 900 years and the Bible in Revelations calls her a great plain and that had harlots or daughters and God's going to throw them all to bed we'll read in just a minute but we look and see that it started in Ephesus with what man man worshiping a woman Diana all right a goddess the tharan age was a propheus didn't call her name but she sat on a three-leg stool and and she prophesied well she was false then the sardian church age we get to in just a minute her name was sael and it was Father's I mean it was son F son Mama son worship and now it's going to turn into just mother worship and I'm telling you it's real slick how they pulled off bringing that mother worship of Mary over Jesus I mean her resurrecting and ascending and the mother of God and they pray to her cuz she's nicer than Jesus is or more nice you think it's bad they believe that they put their life on that do we put our life on what we believe are we sufficiently impressed as I said before that this is the truth can you be shaken from this truth Right Here If You Can Be Shaken from this truth you got to get the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth not just going up and shaking a hand not just filling out a letter not filling out a form we're not getting a job we're getting eternal life amen and it will pull the old you out and put another person inside there called Jesus Christ the life that I now live says I live by the faith of Jesus Christ so our ra though is a great and her daughters so this is where I inserted I pulled it up just a few minutes ago Revelation 17 verse one now Watch What Happens here this is that dark age is develop everything has to develop from a baby form to a mature form even you in Christianity you start as a baby all right everybody with me you start as a baby you make mistakes you fall but you keep eating and you make yourself bigger or you get stronger and you get more um knowledgeable about how to handle things same way in Christianity if you look at your life you can tell how Christianity is don't look at your life at the center I mean look at your life as a human being that goes from a baby sucking a bottle to a person eating food and then knowing what food we like knowing F what food we can get and later in the Years knowing what food we can't eat cuz you ain't got no teeth so anyway and there came this is Revelation 17 now watch this is the now the development this is the this is the Apex but the development of it was right there in Columba and Luther's time all right is everybody with me they had to start somewhere and Satan started so slick it took him 900 years to develop just one thing and that was the merry worship and the Indulgence es and the novenas you know your your your your son's in purgatory he's burning right now if you'll pay a couple thousand dollars or whatever it was back then we'll get him out that's how they got rich that's why they have the filth Rich of the world they got all the gold listen Rome will rule this whole world for a short period of time but God says what he's going to do to her and there came out one of the seven Angels which had the seven bows and talk with me saying unto me come hither I will show thee unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters and we know Waters is what people we know Catholicism rules about what over half of the whole world is is Catholic all right so three and a half b no four billion now since it's 8 billion people four billion people believe what I'm telling you right here all right and they're sincere people don't get me wrong but you can be sincerely wrong you can get caught in the wrong thing with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication listen Biden don't rule nothing and if if watch his face gets in he ain't going to rule nothing Putin don't rule nothing the Catholic Church rules it all why we even get on the line and look say oh I think I think Trump the God's going to get us out of here no Trump's just a pawn Biden's just a pawn Biden may not know it but he's B he has a few gaps in his memory every once in a while but the pope is always going to be there the pope is going to be the one that's going to take this world and totally rule it when we're gone but he's starting it right now and he's been starting it for years with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication do you know back in the 60s brother Jimmy Harris has got a book and he studied up on a lot of that about the Jesuits and the black pope and all the things like that that we don't know about that we haven't studied and if you want to study this okay but the Catholic Church put a put a couple it's true story all over the country and put them in churches Baptist methodists different places to corrupt the church hello and they got found out about it later on but they would put a couple the man and a woman that wasn't even married put them in they come into a church like they were married they'd start with this all different idea and then they'll start getting involved and they really didn't get involved then they got involved with the men and the women tore the church up so they said well let's go over to this place and what was it it was Catholic so with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication now this is Kings of the Earth are committing fornication with whoever this person is whoever the great is and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk try to tell somebody that's a Catholic that the Catholic church is wrong and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting Upon A Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy and having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scar color and decked with gold precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand look not full of prayers there's another one that has prayers that are going up to the Saints because they're sainted people this is a cup of a hand in her hand full of Abominations and fil in it listen that's not that's not worldly people that's churchgoers hello I'm going to be playing tonight that's churchgoers everybody with me having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots so what is the mother mother is the the harlots are the kids daughters daughters are churches women all right so she's got the head Church which is Rome we know that and then she got there all the little bitty ones and I you know you can call it whatever you want it want to call it but they're all drinking it's all going to come under one rule you can be a Baptist Methodist Pentecostal what brand m whatever you want to be but there's going to come a time when we leave this Earth when the Holy Ghost Le this Earth with the bride that she's going to rule the world and guess what she's going to tell the Baptist what to preach she's going to tell the Pentecostals what to preach and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus now here's your situation where we're looking in this staran church age they killed 68 million Christians who the great and the harlots and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her look now watch John John hear John's writing what he saw everybody with me John's writing what he saw he sees this scene and he wondered with great admiration brother R said he looked at it and wondered at it like this thing's so nice the angel had to smack him upside the head and said hey John why do you Marvel at this this is dead this is Devils this is lies this is the blood of your people and the angel said unto me wherefore Dost thou Marvel why you look even look at this I will tell theee the mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carrieth her which ha the seven heads and 10 horns now we don't get into all that but we'll cover this right here the Beast that thou sawest was and is not now what does that mean one Pope dies another Pope comes into Power one Pope dies another Pope comes into power they back with me now brother Brown taught this forever now it's exactly what it is the Beast that sawest that thou sawest was and is not and shall sin out of the bottomless pit and go to predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world all right when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is in other words one Pop die one Pope dies another one takes over listen they literally think that God just dropped himself right into that poke right when they put all that stuff on him and walk him out there they said that's God ain't that right and sister an was here she tell you exactly what it was he's God he's a viker bious filad that's the name on that triple crown which adds up in Roman in the N um old Roman numbers 666 exactly I even saw it on Facebook today that somebody posted it not from the message but from somewhere else that that vicarious Philly idea if you move over to the AES and the and Adam all up it adds number 666 wow 1 Timothy 5:6 but she that liveth in pleaser is dead while she liveth all through that church age they thought they were alive they thought they were doing something for God they thought they was you know cleansing the world doesn't that sound familiar ain't that what Hitler did he thought he was cleansing the world it was that same devil they just the devil the listen if people die devil don't devil just moves over into another being that will what yield itself to him like Hitler did in different ones so in the th Church age brother R said look what will the punishment of the Harlot and her children well it's going to be twofold first he said I'll cast her into a bed according to the verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or the Great Tribulation and I've said many times and I tell you if you're born again tonight if you're born again tonight you don't have to go through any kind of tribulation why in the world would would God put his own wife through tribulation that is another false Doctrine hello somebody I'm just happy that Revelation come to me I don't have to go through that I listen brother John it makes me ill reading it what people's got to go through the Bible says the birds will eat you while you're still alive your skin will fall off what nuclear your skin will fall off of your bones while you're still alive what a horrible thing listen get into Christ if you get into Christ he'll take us out of here before that happened he'll never put his wife through that would you put your wife through a tribulation no these little minor things we're going through now is nothing compared to when we get out of here amen amen cuz Rome's going to rule the world she's going to do exactly what she did to try to kill those 68 million she's going to try to kill the people that want to stay the foolish virgin the on that wants to stay try to be stay in white and try to be good and try to not be a part of that system she's going to kill them all secondly it says it will kill them with death or as literal translation said let them be put to death with death they open their services with the same Bible we do I mean there's written in Latin and you can't understand it but it's still the same Bible this is where we get the Latin Vulgate is where we get the Bible from the Catholic Church preserved it enough so they could write the book The Bible Martin Luther and different ones tale and all them to put the book together well they had it the Catholic Church preserved it praise God for that let them be put to death this is a strange thing by hanging and electrocution and I hope you caught some of that what Brother Richard was talking about when we come to and start looking at the thing called a third pull which some a lot of you may not be familiar with that brother Ram had the three visions and and what basically what the third pull is is that we are coming to a place to where death is destroyed to where we are not under false Doctrine death can't touch us but see if you take on a false Doctrine death has already not touched you it's already got you amen it's already got you don't fall into that let's don't be put to death by death let us what eat of the Tree of Life y'all see an 85 year old man 86 year old man get happy Brother Richard got happy this weekend at 86 years old why because we've been what we have been changed from Death to life we have been brought out of Darkness we all were had the different ideas we all had these denominational ideas till we started reading the Bible like it was supposed to be read and not by a Catholic or by a priest or a pope or whatever you want to call it Bishop Elder so spiritual death came in you can be just as alive and just as happy and just praise God and be as dead as a doornail if you take on a false Doctrine all right death became a resident where shortly before only life reigned as the original Eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization has brought death it's the product of a double corruptor nanism bism propagated by what Always by a woman what was Samson's downfall Delila Always by a woman so it's always going to be by a church so the word death means that separation natural or violent of the soul and Body by which the life on Earth is ended now we know that one is that one is is pretty obvious we go to a funeral we see him put the body in the ground the soul goes somewhere and we don't see them anymore but what about a group of people that's walking around dead as that or worse and going to work every day playing the stock market doing all the different thing you know doing the worldly things and they're just as dead while they're living so now let's look this is something else I want to bring out for just a minute we were talking about the first two the seals now let me explain something real quick quick about the seals if we go to Revelation 6 there is a there is a scene in heaven that there is a seven sealed book a rolled scroll not a book like this all right we'll get into it later on but something rolled up like this and it's got all right a seal on it so that's what John saw all right so John saw the lamb take a book in Revelations 5 all right then in Revelation 6 he said he said let's we'll read it in just a minute we're right here Revelation 6 verse one and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so so can you see what's inside of that now there's something written some of my notes but if it's sealed with that you can't read it but it's in there and it's good for you amen but so it takes something to open the seal to show these great little quotes that I got but it was always in there brother Gary it was always there but it was sealed up what because Daniel 12 said seal it up Daniel until when the time of the end which is right now because this is what me and you need to get out of her my people right so what is the opening of a seal it's the loosing of a Ministry it's something never before been seen or been looked at by man but it's always been in there when the Seal's open it's the Bible when the seal was open it wasn't something mysterious and God had to write another book it came out of this book right here but what did it do John had to eat that book so he ate the seals and then what happened brother Bob he prophesied he opened a Ministry there was a Ministry that was loosed well listen when the lamb opened of the seals and I heard it word the noise of Thunder one of the four L Beast the lion he opened the ministry Paul ireneus Martin he opened the ministry and then what happened here comes the devil behind it with his ministry cuz if it Loos the good one Satan's going to loose a bad one cuz remember he's a copycat he's not an originator he can't originate anything whatever he does he perverts what God's already made amen and I saw and behold a white horse now look the lion said come and see he opened the seal opened the lamb opened the SE and said hey this is what it says inside that's why I love you know you you take Brother Richard said many many times and we'll cover that brother R said here tonight stands a lamb with a book in his hand Christ had come to Earth you can say what you want to brother Ram's not God not even close to God but he's closer to God than anything else you'll ever see and God used used him to pull that seal open and say right here is where you going to get it from right here is a ministry that's going to be loosed that people for 60 years now we preach the same message well most have and I saw and behold a white horse oh beautiful he that sat on him was somebody sitting on it had a bow but he didn't have any arrows and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer that's what we just read in Revelations we see that that it didn't become a Roman Catholic Church until we talked about it when church and state under Constantine come together he put Rome he put papal Rome which was a floundering religion that didn't have many didn't have many synagogues at all Constantine said hey I kind of like them people I'm going to give them power I'm going to take church and state and put them together give them land give them power give them wealth and a way to gain wealth and then we all going to get wealthy all right but he had a bow and no arrows so he's a bluff he bluffed himself through those first three ages he bluffed his way into the true white righteous Church in other words the doctrine that when that seal opened the doctrine of Paul arenius and Martin it was pure Paul wrote 80% of the New Testament that's the pure word of God that's what we go by I can't understand why people say oh you just got this man this Prophet that you quote him all the time we quote Paul all the time we quote Peter all the time y'all like to quote we not y'all but people quote Billy Graham all the time he's dead and gone I like to quote a messenger that's Vindicated by the word of God what he was who he was and who he was to you can say Amen or sit there if you want to it excites my soul that we had somebody come and tell us the truth but Satan bluffed his way and got himself into those people Bluff them right out of the true word of God and give them formalities give them took down Jupiter and put up Peter took down uh Zeus or whatever and put up Paul it's just paganism from one place to the other it's just now under Catholicism or the Catholic church till the first three ages they did have a concrete Ministry there was a Ministry loosened by Paul irenius and Martin it was true there wasn't any there wasn't any error in what they preached now there was error coming y baby form there was Era coming baby form but in that fourth Church age is when church and state came together that middle age Tara came together and power was given but what was that power God loosed another ministry under Columba they called the church to repentance they called the church to do things right they called the church to do things according to the Bible the Bible was just just getting ready to get put together so when he had opened the second seal who the lamb listen who is the Lamb the Lamb's that man standing there with seven stars and seven candles and standing in the midst of the candlesticks he got the Stars that's the son of man that's Christ Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost same person not three and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast what I heard the second beast so somewhere there was a power in that second beast or the ox to say come and see God released a Ministry of works we just read that he loose the ministry but what well what did Satan do he said well thing work so can I I'm going to work on Constantine I'm going work on Austine of Hippo I'm going to work on these great people see Satan always tries to work on the great glamorous people I want to take the people that that I want to meet the people that was under Columba that he preached and died and they still picked his message up and they still took it through the age and they still took it to the Gallows they still took it to the to the arena and died for what they believed in that's who I want to meet amen we're not going to meet them other guys except judging them at the day of judgment Constantine was not a Christian sorry about that and His holy war was pretty Unholy and then went out another horse that was red what power was given now to bring a message of works and Grace and slow development Ox AG but there was also a red horse and power was given him to take peace from the earth Constantine says put everything together in have peace hello he tried to put every well he did he put everything together well it's going to be peaceful now we ain't going to have all this shouting acts 238 group of people hello somebody we ain't going to have none of that noise but what he done was he took peace from the earth and turned it into a war that lasts 900 years between Christians and Catholicism don't you believe that horse is not red it was red with the blood of Martyrs during that church age and that they should kill one another what I'm a Christian I'm a Christian who you going to believe well you're going to believe you know what if you were standing watching you'd believe the ones that had the power cuz we'd be deceived if we didn't have the Holy Ghost but if you had the Holy Ghost You' say put me in the arena with them that's the ones I want to be associated with like today we're Outcast we're different praise God God's a separator look and there was given unto him listen in the first three Church ages Satan was given a bow with no arrows he had no power to shoot with he could just deceive but in the in the third and going toward the fourth Church age he was given a sword which is what it's a word he was given a word to live by then and to make others live by but it was read and it was wrong but God had a word in Columba that fit into those people's lives that gave their life for what they believed in brother B said look now let's go to the second seal when the when the Risen lamb opened it and the second calf like Beast said come see what the seal mystery in other words see what this ministry is all about now we get it the lamb you remember has to open every seal and the second beast if you notice in the routine of where we just went through with the church ages he's referring back to the church ages the first was a lion all right everybody with me the first three Ages was the lion l i o n that was the that was the the call of the age that went out and then Satan sent his man right after him a white righteous Church all right he won't look different Saint don't want to look different but God does God wants you to look different that's why we're different you see and this Beast said come see not coming and wonder come and look at what's fixing to happen now and when the lamb opened the seal and then went to seea and when he walked in what happened let's see what he found come see there's a mystery sealed up remember the mystery was sealed up that's been now for 2,000 years let's see what it is now we find here he saw what a red horse go forward in the th tyan Church age why because there's killing 68 million the population of California and Texas the two largest states one of the two because of Alaska Alaska don't have nobody in it but if you took California and you took Texas took everybody in it and killed every one of them that's how many of the Catholic Church killed during those 900 years now notice that sure shows they should kill one another they should kill kill each other his bow had no arrows at first you can't kill somebody now you might Whack Him over the head with a bow but if you arrows you can kill somebody with it all right but his great sword did he done his killing later changed from a white horse to a red horse the same exact Devil with his sword what Jesus say Jesus said they that take the sword will perish by it don't fight back it Jesus that night told Peter said put your sword up man now now remember he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding a red horse waiting through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now the difference in that and me and you if you got the Holy Ghost tonight you say father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing father they're blind they've not been the seals have not been open to them the lamb has not been shown to them like the Lamb's been shown to me and you that's a true Christian instead of Revenge Revenge that's all they wanted Revenge now do you understand it how many understood what that seal is now we'll get to them later we'll just skimming over it now they that take the sword will perish by it now watch this riter and all this Kingdom subjects that are slain down through the age that's drawn all this Blood of the martyrs of the Saints will be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes that's what we're talking about here in Revelations they that took the sword to be slain by it they took the sword of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the real true worshippers all down Through the Ages by the millions and when Christ comes with his sword for it is his word that proceeded out of his mouth he will slay every enemy that is before him you believe that he's going to K let them kill theirself with death but he's the Bible tells us don't be afraid of the first death you better be afraid of the second death you better be afraid of what's coming on you if you don't get the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost you going to die again it won't be an eternal death hell's not Eternal if hell's Eternal God's got to be there ain't but one there ain't but one Eternal and that's God Satan ain't Eternal and hell was created so it's got to be done away with what did Jesus say he that takes the sword all right look you you might have killed 68 million of them down through these ages maybe more but Jesus said he that taketh the sword will perish by it brother R said one time before he said 68 million they killed with a sword no telling how many other Millions by their Doctrine cuz the doctrine will kill you as the Impostors against the word of God and because they wouldn't agree and this thing Satan placed look Satan placed United political and spiritual power which he held together and made a church that sweeps into every nation he put Millions times Millions after he jumped off his White Horse got on his red horse he took his sword and went forth but God said with the same thing he perverted or tried the false teaching that same word will rise in power coming forth from the lips of Jesus Christ and it shall slay him and everything before it that's the second seal do you love him oh my that's thus sayith the Lord let's continue just a minute oh what was he given then first he had a bow he didn't have any arrows but now he's got a mighty sword in his hand he can do something now he jumps off his White Horse the white horse rides on out and he straddles a red horse blood blood red he really rides that one see he's giving great power and a sword to kill then he rides his blood red horse we see from the second seal that was broke last night he took peace from the earth and did kill one another and his own martyrology of the Roman Catholic church if you read Fox's book of Martyrs I think Daddy's got a copy in there if not he's got one at home and you can get them anywhere you want to they agree that they killed 68 million people 68 million Protestants to death from a time of St hippo of Augustine of Hippo until 1580 68 million Smucker's great reform if you want to read it glorious Reformation are Fox's book of Martyrs too 68 million recorded on a mar martyrology when one of their so-called Saints got the Revelation that anybody disagree with the Roman Catholic Church would die heretic they just sent him around them boy went to spilling blood he jumped on his White Horse and his red horse went riding now his great power now watch he was made viker of heaven and worshiped as God ruler of the Earth by uniting the church and state Together made him ruler on Earth give him a crown over that he could pray the souls out of purgatory he could also uh I think that's brother B was going to say intercede he was just like God on Earth instead of God together he had great power now let me back up just a minute if you were listening to what Brother Richard said if you are if you are a child of God if you're a son and daughter of God if you come to The Headstone you're God but you've come to the right God you've come through the right channels God said you are Gods I want you to be that way but I want you to be that way because of me I don't want you to be that way because of the devil and the devil's saying Hey I want to be incarnate too I want to be able to do the thing well he will be he'll be incarnate in a pope when we leave out of here Satan is going to enter that Pope and he's going to start killing again do not get caught in the tribulation right and I'm sorry but I think we're even us that are of older age if we don't get out of here in a Rapture you're going to go through it me and brother Harris was talking the other day talking about sister Christa trying to do right trying to do things right trying to do things right I said brother Jimmy I said God told me showed me a long time ago why a lot of people are dying before their time cuz see sister Christa if she didn't become a become bride she's not going to have to go through the tribulation period And I believe like brother Jimmy God said he give you the desire of your heart and if you desire your kids you hang on you hang on Amen you sure what that look circumstances but she I believe she gave her heart to the Lord she was trying to do better there was certain things that he was telling me testifying that she was trying to get better and and uh if she wasn't bride she'd be giv eternal life she for being good to the bride or or whatever that's not my choice but at least God sealed her a way where she does not have to go through tribulation how many of you Associates I've had several that just drop over dead but they're the best people they helped you cuz I remember scripture brother he was adamant he said read that scripture what Jesus said a cup of water in my name will not be forgotten here or forget forgotten over there all right let's don't try to live like the devil though and give a cup of water to Brother John dared I don't think that's going to happen bride all right that's Premed that's that's iniquity but there's going to be people like I said before there's going to be people that change your tire open the door for you let you you know done something for you in life that don't care a thing about God I just believe in grace God said he give it to you and you remind God on the day of judgment hey this guy changed my tire on the middle of the interstate he didn't have to but he helped me he said hey because you've done it to me when the Bible said when did you do it to me remember they had the parable he said when did you do it he said you did it to me because right here you did it to me because right here if he changed your attire and you're God in human flesh hello somebody I hope you can swallow real good if you're God in human flesh called The Bride then who's he doing it to this Jesse who's he doing it to he's doing it to God he's doing it to Jesus cuz that's what's inside you so God won't forget that he said hey dude may I say dude but enter into the joy of the Lord because of this person right here God may be Southern he may say dude I don't know he said hey brother you did that unto me and you know probably the man's going to go I don't I've never met you I never gave my heart to you he said well come here Rebecca Atkins which he'll say you did it for her oh I remember I changed her Tire something inside of me said turn around and go back hello something inside of me he said help this person and because of her he'll receive eternal life that's the God I serve but let's don't depend on that or let's don't depend on deathbed confessions especially if you're sitting here tonight all right sorry more is what more is given more is required all right everybody with me all right State can't say nothing he's head of it so they die by the millions all them little churches Brothers was busted up killed murdered fed to lions and everything else the dragon Rome give him his seed and Authority the Bible said so so he wrote his typed red horse through human blood till it became a red horse and this is the church that 4 billion people worship today all their little Trinkets and all their little hail mares and all their little beads they got to Matthew 6 says for where your treasure is there will your heart be also the Light of the body is the eye therefore th eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness and if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness Martin Luther look Martin Luther came he stepped out of that Darkness he got a revelation that the just shall live by not Penance the just shall live by the faith of God and he turned around and said if that light that's in you it's killing you it's making you dark come out of her my people and be not partaker of what her plagues plagues her church I'm going scream till I can't scream it anymore come out of her whatever you're in he said come out of her my people he didn't say Devil's people so we got caught in that mess maybe you're caught in that mess now but get out of it get out of it get in the truth I'm talking about all of us we got error all of us got error I I listen I want God to say come out of her every day every hour come out of that get up stop that it ain't got to be a church building with doors and Steeples the things we do wrong that's what God Said come out of that all right now we're on the sardan church age it's all right just for a few minutes I did you and I got it glad you're on a cane now you can't get up here and hit me with that big old thing you used to have and to the angel of the church in Sardis right these things sayith he that hath the seven spirits of God now all seriousness that was a horrible age we just talked about the the all the doctrines that that are killing people now that all developed and it didn't just developed it came to a head and started speaking it was a deed don't you think Jesus wasn't God I I don't know if that man was God I saw him cry I I don't he he went to the bathroom that can't be God well that little saying started then you come over all the way to the Catholic church and says no he's like God he's a he's another person you ought to see in that book some of those images that the Catholic Church come up with they're hideous it's a three-headed man a father a son and a holy ghost three-headed figure three different persons in the godhead that came from Zeus and Thor it didn't come from God behold oh Israel the Lord thy God is one Why Can't We Believe see that's so simple that's so simple Jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father sure he was in another form he had on flesh but that was God inside of him the father was in him and when you look in Revelation you see one sitting on a throne not three you don't see three personalities sitting on a throne you see one God is one now God like Brother Richard said it was really great he said now he's not one like your finger like he just stands still no he has many manifestations like I am a father a son I'm a spirit I'm a postal worker I'm a this I'm a that the other but I'm just one guy but if I was God and I was omnip ENT I'm I'm the present knew everything knew where to be I could be there and still be standing here talking to you hello hello CU if the Holy Ghost is talking to you tonight and if he's over there in Ron Spencer's church and he's talking it's the same Holy Ghost but God can do that and we can't stop it you can try to stop it all you want to you will not stop the sovereignty of God that's why like brother Ernie says we need to attach oursel to something Eternal Eternal and I believe we have we've attached oursel to the Eternal God and before the foundation of the world sure sure we were in the mind of God the Eternal section but we had to come here to be lost to have him to develop him into a what a savior A Healer a redeemer I Know Thy works that thou has a name that you liveth now this is sardian church age and are dead be careful Be watchful strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God he didn't say I was doing away with you he said I just don't there's not some things you're doing I don't like but I'm going to read to you in a quote just a few minutes where brother R said God was pleased to be in that age pleased now if God's pleased he can't change his mind all right he was pleased to be in that church age all that they went through we read it a minute ago so the combat Beast the living creature was what it was a man it was from 1520 to 1750 and I read to you pocket watch water wheel knitting machine microscope U small poxs vaccine the cotton gin gas lights bifocal glasses parachutes lightning rods you know who did that everybody know who who created a lightning rod don't you brother Ryan who created light Rod who he's on your $50 bill Benjamin Franklin remember he was flying his kite y'all don't remember history he was flying his kite and had a had a key on it and when the thing hit it it well he C no really he created lightning rods from that he started putting them on people's houses and the house didn't get burned down because he knew that thing if it struck it it would go in the ground it actually went into him the first time read about that okay so let's go somewhere else in the 1700s a piano steam engine dictionary steamship bicycles you see the difference even Martin Luther he rode a horse John Wesley rode a horse but they were coming into play here with bicycles this was in the 1700s gas lights the cotton genen the cotton genen Revol revolutionized almost the whole world cu the cotton Jin you had to sit there and put pick those seeds out of the cotton you had to have hundreds of people picking just a little at a time that cotton Jin who who who invented it yes and that in that right Ireland Eli Whitney okay but but look I'm saying is God moved from what the Dark Ages into an age of now things were becoming more because look the cotton genin is now what you see up there at um at New Holland It's a cotton mill they're doing Millions an hour where they were doing Millions a year with that cotton genin cuz it was just one but that all developed what are you saying the word began to be developed under Martin Luther the just shall live by faith Wesley sanctification live a good holy life te doesn't have any uh tea doesn't have you know he because he was an English he was an Englishman and they drank tea remember they had their tea time they drank their tea spot of tea he said it don't have any value to it why are you stopping and drinking tea for go to work the man preached 4,000 sermons in one year 15,000 I think I read to in his whole lifetime what a guy so the church age now is the sardian church age we're going to see right here what Sardis Sardis means the escaped ones they couldn't escape in the th tyan age but they were beginning to escape they were beginning to come out of her my people with a man called Martin Luther which was in that Catholic Church part of the Catholic church and he was was reading the Bible as it was being put together he's reading the Bible and he said oh it says the judge shall live by faith and guess what happened a Ministry was loosed there was a Ministry a man Ministry the third the third Beast which was a man said come see and that seal was open t loose the just shall live by faith we'll get into that later on the religion of that time was siel and her son which is Theo all right that was at first then during the rest of the church ages watch what brother Ram said of that age he was a son God she was a moon God he was the Lord of Heaven she was the Queen of Heaven he was a revealer of goodness and Truth she was the gentleness and mercy he's the mediator she's a mediatrix he with the key that opens and shuts the gates of invis invisible world and she with an identical key doing likewise now look this is not the church all right this is this is uh um what would you say witchcraft or whatever they use or all that he was the judge she was standing at his side he being killed raised and ascended into heaven she carried there bodily by the son watch how that develops now in Rome this same God is given the title of Our Lord he's called the Son of God while she is called the mother of God now that is what we find back there in the other two ages where the mother and son concept took on such TR tremendous proportion but now notice that even as it was back in Babylon that the worship of the son began to lose out in favor of the worship of the mother it's called mariology if you want to look it up they put Mary above Jesus because she's nicer more nice she's sweet to you let's pray to her let's don't pray to Jesus cuz he's mean but now notice that even as it was back in Babylon that the worship of the son began to lose out in favor of the worship of of the mother so she literally began to take the place of the son we see in this age that the Pagan worship of sardus was the worship of the woman it was sail alone not sail and deas at the end the mother has literally taken the place of the son endowed with the merits of godhead now listen the the spirit in that Catholic Church which was evil the devil saw that saw the people in Sardis enjoyed that saw that they took to that and what would they start doing they inserted marry and Jesus in there this whole Catholic Church It Ain't Nothing But The Devil sure there's good people in there there sincere people in there but every Doctrine they have is a madeup lie all one needs to do is go over her various titles and recall the lovely attributes accorded Mary by the Roman Church to understand where the religion of this age came from the that this is the age of the first real break with Papa Rome that actually flourished what what you doing Martin Luther Martin Luther is a reformer right he's and he's a Protestant he's protesting the Catholic Church all right he was in it for all the time but watch no doubt caused the Jezebel prophetess to consolidate and emphasize her doctrine of mariolatry in decided opposition to the Protestants who denied her any part in the Plan of Salvation apart from her favor with God in other words as be in the oven Mary was the oven Mary was the womb that brought Jesus that's it cuz Mary had to be saved Mary had to go to Pentecost to get born again but they said she died and resurrected went to heaven just like Jesus as Luther crystallized the doctr of justification by faith they held to Works Penance prayers and other unscriptural means and as the freed Christians glorified the son the Roman Catholics increased their deification of Mary see how Satan God said hey you go that way and I'm going this way the Roman Catholics increased their deification of Mary until the 20th century now watch this is now the 20th century saw in opposition to most high ranking Roman the theologians now this is they opposed it Pope P literally exalted Mary to glorification in a resurrected body there's only one God there's only one empty tomb it's not Mary's sister Julie and brother Gary were there close by so I believe that she's probably still in there the body of it is anyway that Doctrine is absolutely the babylonius one of the son carrying the mother bodily into heaven all right let's talk about Martin Luther he was born in 1483 and we'll stop right here he died in 1546 he was 62 years old he was a little bit sickly later on in his years but Martin Luther was a German but now remember before we get started here's where you're going to look at like brother Chad Lamb said it's it's simple to see this but yet it's going to be hard to see this it's going to be simple to see that Martin Luther was led by God that he was a born again Christian and his age but you going to see some things over here that he did that didn't look very good but he was a man but he was remember he was a reformer he wasn't a restorer we needed a restorer we didn't need a reformer here in this age Jesus no wait a minute the Bible says I will reform what the k go no he said I will restore whatever was eat I'm going to restore it so that's why like brother Wilson said if the if they eat him down in the old at the end of the Old Testament they killed Jesus amen he resurrected was Son of God through the church Ages was happy to be in Martin Luther even though Martin Luther had some problems but he had to come over here in the end time and raise it all back up to see it again because the seed's what went in the ground all right everybody with me so let's read a minute on him just a second he was a German priest theologian author he wrote hymns he was a professor and an augustinian frier Luther was the seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation and his theological beliefs formed the B basis of Lutheranism he is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in Western and Christian history brother R said the same thing he's very important man he was one of the most popular ones why because he started the reformations he started the protesting of the cath listen people were scared to do it they were scared to death literally to death to even say anything against the priest that's why those priests could have listen that those priests they had women they had boys they did whatever they wanted to demon possessed but called it priesthood because they were under the ospice of the Catholic Church Luther was ordained to the priesthood in 1507 he came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church in particular he disputed The View on indulgences Luther attempted to resolve these differences amicably remember brother Dell told us many years ago the way you read Martin Luther Martin Luther sure he protested sure he was he was wanting to bring the the church he didn't want he didn't want to do away with the Catholic Church though he still brought some of their Doctrine now this age that we're in now the Resto St he didn't bring any of them doctrines out with him he cut them down Luther attempted to resolve these differences amicably first proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulges in his 95 thesis which he authored in 1517 I believe it was in October in 1520 though the pope gets involved he demanded that Luther renounce all of his writings and I'm I'm going to read to you what he wrote back to the to the priest I mean to the to the pope uh to to their God he demanded that Luther renounced all of his writings and when Luther refused to do it he was excommunicated in January 1521 later that year Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV condemned Luther as an outlaw when Luther died in 1546 Pope Leo the 10th excommunication was still in effect do you know they sent people to kill him and they couldn't do it the Roman Catholic Church sent people to kill Martin Luther like a007 thing you know couldn't do it he always get out from under listen you ain't going to go to God's ready for you to go his ministry wasn't over actually just been started Jo he condemned Luther as an outlaw Luther taught that salvation and consequently eternal life are not earned by Good Deeds rather they are received only as the free gift of God's grace through the believer believer faith in Jesus Christ listen this was not known for 900 years believe the pope believe your priest believe in indulgences believe in purgatory believe that we can pray you out believe that we can pray you into heaven and for a man to stand up one man to stand up and say that ain't right none of that's right wow all right listen what stand do we make for this gospel we're preaching now that's right eternal life are not earned by Good Deeds rather they are received only as the free gift of God's grace through the believer's faith in Jesus Christ who is the sole Redeemer from sin not mother Mary not not no not your P not your priest not your not your pope Luther's theology challenged the authority and Office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source he's getting in trouble now the only source of divinely revealed knowledge Luther's translation of the Bible in dejour from Latin made the Bible vastly more accessible to the letin now this is where they were trying to kill him they didn't want that Bible to be translated from Latin so that people can understand it right which had a tremendous impact on both the church and German culture it fostered the development of a standard version of the German Lang language added several principles to the art of translation and influenced the writing of an English translation the tendale Bible and remember what they did to tendale they drag him through the street till he till he died because of putting the Bible together his hymns influenced the development of singing in Protestant churches his marriage to Catherine vonora a former nun set a model for the practice of clerical marriage now look he was a he was a a um uh he was what was he he was a like a monk he couldn't you you didn't get married in the Catholic Church men didn't get didn't didn't have wives well they did but you wern't supposed to but Martin Luther comes out and says I'm going to marry this girl it was a friend of his if you'll read all the history it was a friend of his married her she was a former nun and then after that he began to preach a o in Protestants to marry so he developed that too where for 900 years they couldn't do that and twoo later works Luther expressed anti- judaistic now here's where it gets a little antsy calling for the expulsion of Jews and the burning of synagogues these works also targeted Roman Catholics anabaptist and non-trinitarian Christians based upon his teachings despite the fact that Luther did not Advocate the murdering of Jews some historians contend that his rhetoric now remember he was German his rhetoric contributed to the development of anti-Semitism in Germany and the emergence centuries later of the Nazi party that's history Luther dedicated himself to the augustinian order devoted himself to fasting long hours in prayer pilgrimage and frequent confessions Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair now watch what he said he said I lost tou with Christ the Savior and comforter and made of him the Jailer and hangman of my poor soul that was under Catholicism cuz that's what he does he was condemned condemned condemned condemned condemned and he's telling us that Christ is the Healer the Savior the comforter and I made him a Jailer of my poor soul here's a letter to the Pope I enjoyed the reading this his letter to the pope now listen he's writing a letter to the pope now he's writing a letter to God well so the what they said the first and chief article is this Jesus Christ Our God and Lord died for our sins and was raised again for our justification Romans 3:4 he alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world well that made him mad to begin with and God has laid on him the iniquity of us all not penen not indulgences all have sinned and are Justified freely without their own works and merits by his grace gra through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus in his blood Romans 3:23 this is necessary to believe this cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work law or Merit therefore it is clear and certain that this that this faith alone justifies us nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered even though Heaven and Earth and everything else Falls and the pope read that P read that and that's when he excommunicated him now here's a letter to his followers now watch this we'll close right here in these sermons he hammered home the premacy of core Christian values such as love patience charity freedom and reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change do you know that the devil what the devil thinks when he sees men use vience to propagate the gospel he sits with his folded arms behind the fire of hell and says with malignant looks and frightful grin ah how wise these man men are to play my game let them go on I shall reap the benefit I Delight in it but when he sees the word running and contending alone on the battlefield he shutters and shakes for fear so Martin Luther was a reformer brother says look he was a mighty preacher and a teacher of the word and insisted especially in his first years of public Eminence that the word was the sole Criterium thus he was against works as a means of Salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he taught the mediation of Christ apart from man was as was the original and Pentecostal concept he was a man given to much prayer and had learned that the more work he had to do the more sorely he was pressed for time the more of his time he gave to God In Prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results he knew what it was to battle with the devil and it said that Satan one day visibly appeared to him and he flung an in inell at him bidding him to go another time two Fanatics came to him to induce him to join with them in banishing all priests and bibles he discerned the spirit within them and sent them off it is recorded of Dr Martin Luther in Sour's history that he was a Prophet evangelist speaker in tongues interpreter in one person he was endowed with all nine gifts of the Spirit what stirred his heart by the Holy Ghost In which was the little green shoot that signified that truth was coming back to the church see that's what's important truth was coming back to the church but it looked just like two little shoes it wasn't the stock it wasn't the tassel it wasn't the seed it was two little shoes as it was known at Pentecost was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace apart from works I recognize that d Dr Luther did not believe only and preach only justification but that his major theme as indeed it had to be for it was the basic doctrine of the truth of the word he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of God who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith surely we admit that he knew and did teach that we are to go from Faith to Faith His Marvelous understanding of sovereignty election predestination and other truth show him to be a great man in the word yet I say again as do historians God used him to bring to the people God's standard against works the just shall live by faith when you become a Christian that's what you got to realize that you're justified by faith and actually he wrote in one of his Bibles his one of his U uh copies of the Bible he wrote alone justified by faith alone now watch they'll do this then we'll close musicians come on now as I mentioned already this age was been called by the historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it was it had to be that for Martin Luther was a reformer not a prophet so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth and would be a man like the Apostle Paul who was both Apostle and Prophet the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age let's stand but it was not the best that could be said was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing my yes there certainly was this age had justification but it missed sanctification and the baptism with the Holy Ghost that is what God's original plan was that is what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost while listen to me the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is the reason there is a church it's the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did came back upon the church at Pentecost so that they did the works that he did this age did not have those work watch all they had the written word but not the revealed word only a revealed word comes by what a prophet a prophet is a Divine revealer of the word of God that's why we had to have a prophet in the end time according to Malachi 4 to turn our hearts back oh they had the written word but not the revealed word this was the Reformation period but fear not little flock God said I will restore and this reform was going to be the start of it he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depth of Satan in the dark ages to the depth of God that they had at Pentecost and in the first few years of the existence of the church now be careful and get this in the second verse I read for I have not found thy Work perfect before God do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it's unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it just start it was just the start of getting back that is why said the Bible called it Reformation that's going down here it was wonderfully good but God had said 1500 years before Luther you're going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to later hallelujah our god reth he knows the end from the beginning yes Luther was his messenger it didn't look like it as We examined the flaws but there was a man called Jonah he had flaws in his life too he was a prophet though you and I might not want to say so and the basis of how he acted now this was an unfulfilled age it was an age of reformation but that is how God wanted it so you don't condemn that's how God wanted it he wanted it to he want listen God will make a mistake I know you've heard that before so what he started he's going to finish the only reason and way that you and I can develop what we call the born again or New Birth experience is start by justification knowing that it's not your Works knowing that is being justified by faith in Jesus Christ gets you started on your journey period nothing else you can work yourself to death and die and go to hell but you truly Justified the Bible says what he who is Justified he's already glorified true justification listen to me true justification leads to true glorification and it had to start in a man called Martin Luther who hated the Jews he started an Insurrection that killed thousand people didn't read that one he had a lot of flaws you know what so did Moses Moses was a great man right what' Moses do he killed a guy he was a murderer everybody with me Paul what' Paul do Paul was one of the greatest Messengers he ever was what'd he do he caused Christians to die caused them to blaspheme but God still used them you know what all I see is Grace thank God for Grace Grace and Martin Luther he's going to be there you going to be able to sit down beside of him and say hey tell me how it was he's going to say no you tell me how it was in yours yours is horrible mine was getting out of the I know he understood he doesn't now what he was doing he was pulling at people come out of her my people get out of that thing and then here in the last end time you and I are to come to a full re Revelation where he had part Revelation he was a reformer you and I have come under a message of restoration restored back to the faith of the fathers way back in Paul's day God bless you that's exactly what God wanted done God is pleased with what he put in motion you and I sometimes put things in motion and we're not really pleased at it but when God put something in motion he steps out listen if he drop eternal life in Martin Luther's Soul it's the same Holy Ghost you got the only difference is is he had this word to work with you and I have got the unsealed word to work with not just partial but the whole unsealed word according to Revelations 5 then we go to Revelations 10 where the lamb came down with a book in his hand open it was an open book let's sing a song God bless you we'll finish the rest of this a little bit later I looked over and what did I see Coming For To Carry Me Home it was a b of angels coming after me Coming For To Carry Me Home sing

down amen he's here he's here not to reform he's here to restore he's not here to reform anymore sure you start in justification into sanctification into the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he's want to take us deeper he's give us the most word of anybody's ever been even from the Apostle Paul till today you and I no more than Paul knew as far as the opening of the seals he didn't speak any of the son of man you and I speak son of man and we know what we're talking about he didn't say anything hardly at all about the son of man but we had a little Prophet coming the end time they caught the mind of God they said let's go back in the back part of God's mind let's go back into the vision part of the mind and then today I'm going to tell you why I preached all this as Brother Richard said that's one that's his favorite book Christ the mystery God revealed he's wore that book out three or four times but it's one ful book it tells you what he was talking about in the seals if you'll just
