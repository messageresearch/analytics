here that's all right uh for the wonderful messages come to this church i would think that anybody here at any time can be called on to full of duty that they should do and and honor the lord and just being blessed being a very small group of people around the world folks we're different by what we know we're different and we should be thank you lord because we know the truth and we've heard it so this morning before we go to the word i just want myself few words and thank the author if you don't mind let's pray precious heavenly father we thank you for this day you've given us come together around your word and my heart shouts hallelujah lord to your word coming to us forgive me father i just you know how i feel about you i love you and i thank you for this day you've given us to come and gather around your word be with us in these troubled times and bother you many times you woke us up during the middle of the night to pray and our pastors taught us it's okay just go ahead and pray he'll put you back to sleep but i tell you what father your word is here and it's strong and it is life and it will not be shunned it will be heard and it will be lived just like you said it would be in a group of people a little group that we're here lord and we ask father that you just bless those that couldn't be here this morning whatever the hinderer says lord you know what it is be with each one of them and bless them lord and bring them back into the fold father where they belong because we can't leave without them and we ask father you just bless the word here today bless

comes from that heart that you've placed those words upon we ask these things now father and bless the opening and reading of your word here this day we asked it in your name amen we're going to read this morning in proverbs 16 16. i was studying a little bit through proverbs and and through the bible period because it's all god's word but uh i went back over proverbs and i'll tell you i've been blessed being here to hear the word that has been taught and i'm gonna tell you i was blessed to set in brother wade sunday school class and to hear brother dale you can't get any better okay two teachers and the nut didn't fall far from the tree back there brother wade i'll tell you that but i went back over proverbs and i was amazed at how much the lord just opened up to me and said this is about wisdom you need wisdom you got to have wisdom hope don't get it by itself but you got to get in that word and become part of it now as we read proverbs 16 16 how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver pride goeth before destruction and unhaughty spirit before fall he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and whoso trust us in the lord happy is he the sweetness of the lips increases learning understanding is a wellspring of life and to him that hath it but the instruction of fools is folly pleasant words are as in honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones he that laboreth labeth for himself for his mouth craveth it of a him man soul strife and a whisper separate chief friends separate cheap he friends his eyes to the device to devise forward things moving his lips he bringeth evil to passion he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city the lot is cast into the lap but the whole dispersion thereof is of the lord amen you may be seated thank you this morning as we get ready to take up our ties and offerings get brother johnson help us

to me lord [Music] my mind keeps going back to that scripture said he he sent his word and he healed them and he delivered them from their destructions where would we be without his word amen he's sending his word to us [Music] this thing opened the eyes of my heart this morning as brother chris long comes open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to sing i want to sing

[Music] shining in the light of your glory oh lord pour out your power and love as we sing holy [Music] be holy holy oh holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see you [Music] yes isn't that our desire this morning amen do you really want to see him why just turn around and shake your brother or sister's hand that's the plan of god i just know it is amen we'll read about it in first corinthians 12 if you give me a chance says god bless you god bless your brother amen thank you it's a pleasure to be here it's uh it's always good like i say to be home with that's a favorite part of the holidays for me i mean i know there's this a lot of controversy and conflict over what we call christmas christmas is not the to me it's not the exchanging of gifts it's the fellowship that you get to have with friends and family and of course the food we like to sit around the table don't we so let's sit around the table this morning and you know if if you're not real hungry just just get some finger food but if you're starving to death there's prime rib available and if you're a vegetarian eat all the vegetables you want it's all good for you amen you love the lord amen amen it's a pleasure to be in the house the lord would you just sit down for just a second i want to uh it came to me as the brother was mentioning and i i think i heard this right it's the b team is the b team here june sister june are you here as a b team i think the b team is considered a derogatory remark but but but wait a minute wait a minute god's word fixes that right up you think the b team is second string right well let's see what the prophet said i didn't give this one to anderson because it come to me when the brother said that straight is the gate 3 1 of 59 started in the paragraph 58 brother brown says lot didn't think watch the a and the b team now lot didn't think that he was going to backslide but he went to looking towards sodom where things were easy and there's many times that we look towards the easy way i'll join this certain certain church and you see nobody will say anything against it because it's the biggest church in the city the easy way i mean it's interesting why the way he's defining the easy way many times we do that when we're wrong he says now this is going to make more sense in this paragraph here in just a second remember if you follow christ you'll be hated by people for all that live godly in christ jesus suffer persecutions and if you come to christ you'll not come by any church or any denomination or any creed you'll come by the blood that's the only avenue in you cannot bring no one with you'll come alone stand on your own confession and your own faith you'll not ride in on the pastor or on your mother's faith you'll come as an individual when you come to god and many times we make those foolish choices ooh you you may not realize that but i'm getting to the b team what if lot when he's seen everything easy he saw where there was much money and much popularity because he'd be a stranger and a smart man educated a lot of psychology and he could do certain things and yet maintain his religion he thought i've got faith in god so i'll just go down into sodom and i'll make some extra money and i'll become a great man maybe a wonderful preacher see you have to make a choice you have a choice to make and the lady has a choice to make the lady is you folks i'll go down to this certain church there oh everybody in town thinks this is the most why the mayor but he's not the mayor of lula so we can't we're not we're not reputing the mayor why the mayor of the city belongs to this church now he could belong to a church that was really good what's wrong with the one we're at but still you have to judge that church and its people by the scriptures sometimes they go because it's a popular way that people dress better they go to a certain places and there's where we make a fatal mistake now notice this here's the a and the b team watch how god looks at the b team and abraham the only thing he could do was take second choice and sometimes the second choice is better than first if it's took like that unquote i've i've i've known about this portion of the message in this quote since oh way way way back in the early 90s because something happened to me and i i i was thinking about how the lord deals with his children and and then god had me put on a series and i believe that this straight is the gate may be found in the series israel in the church or one of those or the church one not the church but okay and i heard that statement and i said with second choice ain't that bad because abraham here is being forced to make a choice now abraham could have took sodom and the fertile valley and the flowing river and the green pastures and if you've ever watched any dramas that the hollywood has produced about abraham when he makes the turn away from sodom they suffer it's dry as a bone it's there's no water anywhere there's no food the animals are dying and people are starting to question abraham are you sure god said you're being presented with the same question this morning so am i so i just thought brother i'd mention that so let's go bt come on amen let's go and i'm not into sports anymore but you know who was a second stringer until the first stringer got hurt tom brady probably the greatest quarterback of all time and i'm not a tom brady fan so nobody get upset i'm just i just have the knowledge that that's how it worked out that's right it was sitting there all the time waiting for the opportunity and brothers and sisters guess what the presentation of god's word for the hour we live in is is granting to you personally the opportunity now to do something about what you've been given but you didn't get it two years ago or five not 10 or 12 or 50. you got it before the foundation of the world but god is waiting till this time for it to be manifested and i believe he wants us to do that job so with that if you'd stand for the reading of the word i think we will go to first corinthians 12 if and so that way i can read out of ephesians while you're seated everybody knows this scripture i quote it we repeat it we know it but i'd like to put some emphasis on it today if we could along with other things in the scripture so first corinthians 12 and we'll start with verse 12. we'll read down to verse 20. all right is everybody feeling all right if anybody's not feeling well come on up we'll pray for you before we start preaching and by the time we get done you'll be all right for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we are be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body well it is and if the ear shall say because i am not the i i am not of the body is that therefore not of the body no if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing okay i want you to get this okay if the whole we're hearing where were the smelling but now have god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet one body let's pray father we are so grateful and thankful i am so grateful and thankful lord that you've given us another opportunity lord for we've been told by prophecy father that there will come a time and it seems like we're just so close lord where they'll want to close the doors of places like this where people come to receive from you lord because the powers that will be in charge don't think you exist and father it makes perfect sense to me because there is no explanation for you lord no mortal man could come close to being able to explain you as a being who had no beginning it's almost impossible for us to think lord how that could be and we'll have no end but father you've invited us this morning into you and once lord we come to the realization that there's a place at the table for us lord and you've placed our name there father and it's in you lord then while we know in our uh body lord of time that we would think well we had a beginning we can have no end if we'll just get in you bless your children for their efforts lord for being here this morning i pray father that you'd give revelation also to those father on the on the stream lord out there in the in in the world father of the church lord i pray that you'd help us this morning father sometimes second choice is better we've made it this morning father we're here we give you all the praise and the honor and the glory and the wonderful and in the precious name of jesus christ amen god bless you may be seated now i could preach on every syllable there but i want you to uh come to an understanding as we move into this morning's message and again i'm i'm not straying off of where we were at on friday night i'm just going to continue to move forward if you remember we were quoting out of revelations 5 how that how that uh nobody could see that there was no man worthy and and john or no one could see how it was going to be possible and then of course uh uh one one of the elders cries out uh god's got this behold the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed right he's he's prevailed he prevailed means overcome now we have to overcome ourselves can i read can i say that again brother boyd got it we have to overcome ourselves because we are our greatest enemy and by overcoming ourselves we are the true overcomer of the day we live in in revelations 3 21 gives us the recipe to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also am overcome and sat down with my father and his throne how many thrones we got well we know that the first throne was in heaven the second throne was in christ and the third throne is in the heart of man but as we mentioned on friday it could be a throne and it was made to be a throne room but who's sitting on it because you know the god of this evil age has tried to set this up to be satan's eden and he wants to sit in that chair but it's god's chair that's why in thessalonians he says i'm going to oh i'm going to be like i'm all raised up higher than god i'm going to be i'm going to get higher than the stars it says in isaiah i'm going to be god good luck because it ain't happening but where do you and i come in seems like a battle that's between god and satan well there's a conflict remember i've preached that here before between god and satan god's here on the right this would be your right satan's here on your left and if there's a conflict between god and satan who is it it's you it's me we're the ones in between and god has set up man's heart to be a throne room now you say well god can take that throne he's a gentleman it is his throne room he brought it into existence but he's made you and i a free moral agent amen so there's a chair a throne is a place of power and authority there's a place in you designated by god of power and authority but you choose as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and so is he who rules and reigns on that throne god's word is seemingly completely contrary to the world we live in prove it there's where the contrariness comes in you can't prove god you believe god faith is something that you believe in which there's no proof that's the dictionary i'm just quoting the dictionary to you now so that's why abraham seemed to be a stumbling block wait a minute i thought you said god talk to you did i not hear something mentioned about a land flowing with milken abraham look where we're at but abraham believed god and if we're going to be the royal seed of abraham amen we're going to believe god no matter what your eyeballs see no matter what your ears hear or your tongue tastes amen and here paul in first corinthians 12 is addressing the body and and if you're really focused on every word that paul gave there you'd understand that paul is trying to convey that this should not be and it was not meant to be a a body that that is uh out of joint a body that's conflicted a body that is confused but paul is reading into it how it becomes confusing to people because they begin to misunderstand the body and its use i hear you brother yeah but you're not all ears some people like me are but i can see what you mean but we're not all eyes now i think it's particularly interesting the way paul in first corinthians 12 was inspired by god to lay it out and then the day you and i live in we're being told that there are only two important parts of the body the mouth that god spoke through and your ears that you should hear him in but paul says wait a minute that's not all there is to this body this body needs to be complete you're still with me all right so then on friday if you remember i put some emphasis just for a foundation for this morning and this afternoon's message of the location no man was worthy is that right what does the bible say let's go to revelations 5 that way i can paraphrase it but let's read it the way it is it'll become important here in just a second revelations 5 1 it says and i saw on the right hand what does right hand mean a position a particular position of power all right and i also want you to know that it also means confidence you see if you have a right hand man you have one in the world we live in because you can put confidence in that man and you believe that whatever needs to be done that man or that woman ever how you want to put it that person is going to get the job done that's why they've become the right hand man and they've been given the authority to to carry out the job now i saw in the right hand brother ram says god don't have a right hand like you're thinking of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals a straw i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book loose the seals thereof no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth so i'm going to stop right there location because there is a man worthy he's just not located in these three places okay because you see john without the revelation that you and i have heard the same thing that we just read and he said oh no no man's worthy but john didn't have the revelation delivered to him that you and i have to pay attention to the location because we found out there was and there is and there always will be a man that's worthy but that man that's worthy came in the form of a lamb unassuming gentle meek nearly powerless to the natural eye but nobody can stop a lamb from producing wool oh they might shave it off every time it gets a half inch long but they can't stop that lamb you see so we look at this meek and this gentle and this awkward and this uh unassuming and and and and vulnerable creature that's not a man see see how we define things but this was the man behold the man but he came in such a way where people stumbled over him they missed the whole point of him being here and what he was doing oh when he was breaking the fishes and the loaves buddy they were lining up at the buffet table coming back for more and there was plenty left over so everybody was contently fed physically then he began to be used by god who was in him to heal the sick now he spoke to the people all along the way they didn't realize that his words were the words that brought everything into existence they had creative power they were only bound by the ears of the here so here paul talking about a body don't worry i'm going to launch into the message i'm just warming up i'm asking the lord to help move me around now i'm gonna do something that i've done here before and i do it all the time at home i feel comfortable i feel like i'm at home so i feel like i can do it here are you okay with that i'm gonna i'm i don't need to read the whole thing even though i love to read it because it makes perfect sense to me but there is a portion of she already had it ready of a statement that brother branham makes and i i know i've read it to you i'm going to emphasize it i want you to get it i think i heard brother black speak about book and names and so forth in the revelation of jesus christ 12 4 60 and the book of revelation has more symbols in it and you know why i read this over and over because of the age we live in this this paragraph here wouldn't make hardly any sense to anybody else but it's the day we live in it's the age we live in it's the time we live in so we're being given something now this statement that i'm going to read to you could have been in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but until god deemed it this statement that was in his mind to be purposeful it wouldn't have made that much difference but the release of the thoughts of god in their due time is the difference maker and then those who were put there by god to receive those statements makes all the difference in the world brothers and sisters the book of revelation has more symbols in it what's a symbol a symbol is a token of identity verified by comparing its other half so the word symbol requires two parts an a team and a b team i don't mind being second string i really don't mind at all to the sadducees and pharisees and the religious figures and the political leaders of the day jesus was down at the end of the bench and he was god the book of revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the bible it has more symbols because it is a book of prophecy that means it's a book that was written for the future now god delivered these this information to john the revelator to saint john on the alapatmos 2000 years ago or so right but at some point brothers and sisters prophecy has to come to pass because it was meant for the future i know this sounds crazy but hollywood gets its inspiration from the creator so we're going back to the future that's real that's reality it's not a movie with a crazy doctor and a car that never worked good it's not they grab that inspiration and and all that hollywood displays all that the film industry displays they got that inspiration you say well they got it from the devil where'd he get it from he's not a creator he had to fetch it from somewhere now i'm gonna ask you a personal question which i ask myself all the time where do you get your inspiration from many times we have to say lord i'm sorry i didn't mean to think that that's not me after a while you you you begin to understand that the thoughts that come to you that start to attack you wherever you're weak or your weaknesses are it's not you and you keep telling them thoughts that's not me that's not me but you've got to mean it and then at some point the overcoming of those thoughts requires not just a statement that's not me requires boldness it requires you the inside man or woman to stand up and say okay i'm ready to fight now because that's not me come on devil i'll take you on what do you mean come on devil you're your own worst enemy i'm my own worst you're not my enemy i'm my own worst enemy i i i see the conflict between god and satan but god has made a way god has has has his own pharmacy my wife uses the term big pharma because it's on the but you understand that's part of the control and you say well wait a minute god's controlling but the way he goes about it is not forced god has afforded you and i the opportunity to be able to look into him into him because he and his word are one in the beginning was the word see now it begins should begin to make sense and the word was with god and the word was god and then here's the key this is the part that the devil don't want to happen the word was made flesh and dwelt among us but once it's made flesh now he has an object an entity a tangible thing that he can try to manipulate that's where you and i come in to him that overcometh amen you're looking at an overcomer and i'm looking at overcomers but guess what we're one body that's why we're not overcoming each other but god knows what he's doing he's put all kinds of people in your way no not so you can overcome them so you can overcome yourself [Laughter] they have their own overcoming to do the bible says they have to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling study thine own self to be approved that doesn't mean you become a theologian necessarily god has to place a person you say well i'm insignificant the janitor is especially in the day we live in is not insignificant they're busy wiping everything down and you know disinfecting everything they seemed insignificant a few years ago but they're not now king david said i'd rather be the gatekeeper than to sit in the seats of the ungodly lord god's prophet to us even revealed it better i'd like to be the doormat you say ain't no way you're there if you're the doormat you're there and guess what he's no respecter of persons remember when jesus went just and any any and brother branham preached about simon and how they didn't wash his feet and then the woman showed up and washed his feet with their alabaster box and her tears and dried it with her hair and brother brandon preached message foot wash flunky who was the foot wash flunky jesus he was the one who inspired her to do what she did so brothers and sisters don't look down upon somebody who doesn't have the stature or the importance or the finance you understand or the position in this material world it's harder for a rich man to go to heaven oh then nobody's going to be saved i didn't say that all things are possible with god all right but don't make it too hard on yourself let me continue to read it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood did you realize it's going to be understood now i think i heard the brother reading out of proverbs and just this last week i saw a little uh plaque that said understanding is better than knowledge it said you may know me but do you understand me so in that case that's why i repeated to you what brother branham said about a man putting upon him you don't know your bible what that man was saying is you don't have no knowledge and when brother branham answered him back i may not but i know the author real well brother branham was stating but i've got understanding see i know the person who wrote the book and that's the most important person to know it's the only reason you and i brothers and sisters can come to any understanding of the book of revelation which is a book of prophecy which is the for the future because it's a prophetic book and it has to be understood by a prophetic class so don't fret i don't understand it i'm gonna i'm gonna be blunt you mean you don't believe it because once you begin to really believe in something for which there is no proof i want you to think about the greatest inventions of all time the inventors of the things that you and i take for granted so casually most of them had a vision it wasn't a vision like god showing them a vision like they were prophets but they saw something that could be done that could work better that could propel could help or could save and they began to work on that vision to them it was prophetic to them it wasn't listen careful the future it was the present but they hadn't attained yet that which they were trying to perform paul even mentions that what i would do good the evils always when i when i would that i could not and i wouldn't you understand paul knew paul knew that there was a future but there's not a thing you can do about it you must live in the present but brothers and sisters you and i have come to a point in time where the present is that future you say you mean the future of humanity the future of the world the future of freedom the future no the future of the body of christ that's how important you are you may feel insignificant and you may think you're not getting it but god has placed you in the age where you are of the utmost importance it just hasn't been revealed to you yet what your job is i'm going to tell you what it is it's to be a prophetic class it's not a job like a title and a name tag and a position that pays a salary this is without money and without price here's what you get out of this deal eternal life no pain no suffering you don't have to worry about your subconscious battling with your conscience you don't have to worry about your mind warring with itself or with me it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class the book is not meant for everybody that's not politically correct but i'm going to tell you that it's been offered to everybody the opportunity has been offered to every man woman and child there's nobody can understand it hardly this book is made for a certain class of people the carnal mind cannot understand them great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them but the ones who are lovers of the word of god that's who the book was written to to the church right okay and i'm going to start moving are you still with me i didn't get up here to bore you to death that's for sure now i'm going to read to you out of the first seal page 110 i know the brother might be able to get that up there now i'm going to start with on 110 brother paragraph 43 now the seven seal rolled book is now being released by the lamb is now being released by the lamb remember this book was kept sealed and a seal is to protect a seal is to keep something bound under lock and key so that unauthorized hands and eyes and ears cannot manipulate it he says now we believe that or let me being released by the lamb we approach that place tonight god help us as the seals are broken and released the mysteries of the book are revealed we're going to find out what this book is here in a minute this this prophetic book this book of symbols he says now you see this is a sealed book now we believe that do we not congregation says amen we believe that it is a sealed book now we never knowed this before but it's sealed with seven seals that is on the back of the book the book is sealed with seven seals he if he was talking watch i'm gonna hold this up about this kind of book it would be like putting strap across it seven straps but it isn't this kind of book why says it is we read in revelations that it uses the word be double okay but it's symbols this object that i have in my hand stands for or represents something other than itself that's the definition and in order to be able to come to an understanding of the true meaning of the symbol another half is required oh not another half of the book but the reality of the definition this is a symbol it says book where did they get the idea for that well of course me i just go to the dictionary now this is what we think when we hear the word book a set of written sheets or paper a set of written printed or blank sheets bound together in a volume watch now watch as we move into the definition of the word book and where this symbol this object that you and i call a book found its roots because if we could find the root of what this symbol is we will have the other half and then it will be fully defined it won't be just a symbol anymore it'll still be called a book and it may still look like one but we'll know its intent right right right we'll know why it's called a book and you may not think it's important but it will be because it's a book of prophecy prophecy is the future but what happens to to us creatures of time is you and i can't see the future we don't really know what tomorrow holds but we should have confidence in who holds tomorrow and it ain't the governments and it ain't the churches and it ain't science they change their mind every five minutes that's their business amen we need to put our confidence in an unmoving unchangeable unalterable object of worship amen god himself so we find as we begin to look into the meaning of the symbol and we get a little deeper into the definition it says something that yields knowledge or understanding that's what books were written for now some of them could be fairy tales some of them could be just just figments of the imagination of the writer some of them could be science fiction as we call it but even in that the writer's intent the author of that work put down in this form what they wanted to convey from themselves is that right in other words let me give you a better definition for it it becomes an attribute it becomes listen now a child of theirs and a good author has lots of children the best author has lots of children right that's right but only one body only one source just like the author of a series of books that they turn into theatrical and everybody spends all kinds of money and then they allow because your eyes are the gate to your soul they allow that information to be disseminated into themselves through their eyes and look at the world we live in it's mad it's crazy it's falling apart brothers and sisters there's only one hope for this world only one it's got to be cleaned off that's not our responsibility our responsibility is to fulfill god's word and by fulfilling god's word he's made a way of escape now if you're trying to escape the destruction of the earth you may have the wrong motive and objective [Laughter] you might find yourself in the room and the bible says how do you get in here you don't have the appropriate garment on [Music] you're not wearing that portion of covering that i ordained for those who find safety in this place take him bind him cast them into outer darkness and there would be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth why because that person fought they were in and do you know what the mistake was that they made they thought right because his understanding is not ours his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his thoughts are not so we have to come clean we have to empty out we have to find ourselves to a place where we realize that we're a wretched sinful character now sin is unbelief it doesn't mean you have to be an alcoholic or a drug addict or a most of the time as i was before i got saved you get to a very low point you've tried all of the of the things that the world has to offer in the form of of drugs and so forth and music and whatever and you find yourself slipping into a darker and darker and darker less light and less light and less light but you think you're happy you're not happy i can tell by the look on your face and you won't let me look into your eyes i've been there i was born in sin shaped and iniquity coming to the world speaking lies full of trouble and shortage age just like everybody else but let me keep going we'll be here all day amen because god's word is wonderful and and like i said you all know me in the beginning i'm a pretty short-winded fella but god's word has made a change in my life so in such a dramatic way that i can't stop loving his word but i thank you listen now as we get closer to the other half of what this symbol is and i just got this out of the dictionary you can go buy the dictionary that i'm using it's not special let's go a little further inside information or analysis oh now we're getting a little intellectual a little scientific also uh dictionary not me but i can see now why god allowed the terminology that is in this bible to be put in there in the form of words not by mistake not happenstance not carelessly but he put them in there so that at some point in time there would be a group of people which i believe we constitute a portion of that body who would be interested enough and going well gee all the denominations use the same book oh christianity uses the same book what makes us different i'll tell you what makes us different is because god has put something in you that transcends the symbol i see it's a book i can read it's a book but we found out that the right hand isn't a hand that's right it's an exact and specific position of authority and confidence wouldn't you love wouldn't you love to have god's book in your right hand amen that means he puts confidence in you brother that means he's given you all recognition of authority to know what to do with it how to handle it and notice as long as it's located in his right hand it's sealed because i can't give you this i can preach until the cows come home and i can't give you revelation flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you peter but my father which is in heaven revealed it to you and on that rock i'm going to build my church and the gates of hell will come against them but they will not they cannot prevail and they've come against they're coming against some of us are standing with them wide open going which way should i go well we read about lot you choose you'll choose which direction you'll go in you do not have to go through those gates because you'll have to fight your way out brother bram says we fight our way to hell it's a free gift the message of the hour you want to talk about brothers and sisters are you hearing me this is the most intricate the most interesting the most hidden work of literature there is no bro that's just the bible my mom and dad have had that laying in the house since i was born but now we've come to the point in time where god has decided to open up that bible you know that one that's been laying around there for decades and for eons and for centuries that's why god sent a prophet not so we could worship him not so we could quote his name not when you hear me reading out of these messages i believe this is god's word given to a man and and and if we don't believe that we're all sorry creatures if you don't believe the man behind the pulpit is an instrument that god is using to take what he's revealed and then put it together and make bread squeeze it it's the fruit of the vine you're wasting your time i'm wasting my time we're no better than the prophet called us a lodge a group of people that gather together under an inspiration for similar ideas this better not be a lodge because i'm no lodge member that's the only thing that will matter it's the only thing that will save us it's god's way of escape but he's been holding it back until a point in time where there's a group of people that are prepared to receive it you have to be ready you have to be willing you have to be able or it's just going to be a few hours of boring time and it's too hot in here and i'm sleepy and i'm hungry but according to the prophet's words when the revelation of jesus christ really takes a hold of you and you surrender yourself to it he said you can't wait till those doors are open because you're not coming here to hear the man and see the woman you're coming here because you're being fed from the soul something in you is crying out and craving now you don't know exactly what it is but he does so he's prepared that's right amen the right inoculation for that problem listen now the word book oh i'm just getting started the word book now remember this is in the hands of the creator i could read it to you but i'll paraphrase it when adam forfeited his rights to this book it could not fall into the hands of the devil satan himself lucifer why because it wasn't his right i'm going to tell you right now that the book that i'm speaking to you about lucifer's name's not in it oh his name's in this book but this is a symbol this is something that stands for or represents something else see you even have to have a revelation of who the devil is and he's obvious but some people i'd rather worship satan they say go for it it's in the book it says there will be people that will do that he was such a good preacher but he deceived angels that's right and he deceived those angels in such a way where the book of jude tells us they left their first estate god had given them property had given them rights god had given them the opportunity which is presented to you this morning to have a place in his kingdom and they rejected it because of some fancy pants preacher remember this is a book of prophecy forget your past i don't care how you've been put upon i don't care who's marred your life it's a book of prophecy it's for the future and it's for your future and your future could be today you don't know that you're not gonna be here tomorrow so today is the day of salvation listen to this but when we get down when we start boiling down the meaning of the symbol it gets down to something very simple it was god its root of the meanings that i read to you out of one word manifest i did make it up i just got out of the picture what is the whole world groaning and waiting paul says in romans it's the manifestation so what manifestation is is it's the life of the manifest and the word manifest finds its roots where's the book at mano hand do you see the connection do you see the symbol the hand has put names in something that it's willing to protect right amen sealed it up the devil can't get to it well neither can you and i as long as it's sealed no man on in but god has made a way amen that's right it's a secret it's a secret and a secret becomes a mystery what's that mean i can't tell you do you mean you can't tell me you mean you ain't got facebook can't tell you have to keep it to myself it's the very reason why when jesus would do a work that seemed like a mighty work let's take the woman at the well forgive me for taking so much time i'm just i want this to get to you even if i only get a sentence the woman at the well think of her life she had five husbands i know churches wouldn't let her in the door her skirt's not long enough her hair's chopped she got makeup on she'd be married five times that's just the one he came for he didn't come to save the righteous excuse me come for the likes of you and me and if you think you're righteous you've got self-righteousness and there's only one thing worse than self-righteousness it's self-humility oh i'm humble yeah i've seen you humble you know what i mean and humble doesn't mean you're you're just a something that the devil can kick around but when humanity wants to kick you around what do you do here go ahead here go ahead i'm not talking about defending your family if somebody's coming after your family you're going to give your life for them just like jesus the devil was coming after his family he said i got this i know exactly how to fix this problem amen i'll stand in the line of fire sin i'll hang on the cross and i'll reverse the effects of unbelief but somebody has to accept it he paid the price brother branham told us in the seals but he never claimed the possession i'll save that for this afternoon amen but you see where we're at brothers and sisters this is all about location amen where are you job who's not going to be deceived come on those whose names are written in a book amen oh man i'll take a little bit more time to break down a few more things amen amen because brothers and sisters this is not a science class this is not a literature class i'm no sunday school teacher but god is revealed through the message of the age what the other half of this is where were you how about your names they had to be located in the lamb's book of life says before the foundation of the world and where is that book it's not a book it's a manifest i want you to get that this is a symbol you know this is a symbol in so much i think you'll get this this is a symbol in so much that this is only a living word if it's in you you understand so once this is in you you no longer need the object you no longer need the symbol you are it you become it that's why they crucified the lord come on you being a man we don't crucify you for your good works we're crucifying you because you being a man are trying to imitate our book no i am the book i am the bread he said i am the wine i'm the i'm the manner i'm the truth on the line on the way and they go [Applause] no we read it in the book that's not the book we're talking about amen if you'll notice this book in revelations 5 is in the hand of the original owner in his right hand but when we get to revelations 10 and this book is open it shrinks it says and a little book was open what happened all the other stuff [Music] lucifer's name's not in it so that's out this is not in it that's out this is like brother branham said a man came to him one day and said we speak where the bible speaks we're silent with the bible silent brother brad said really ah judas hung himself will you do the same yeah oh what a what a simple but sublime statement you're going to do everything the bible says throw yourself off that cliff but it's also written the only way you'd know that is if the book was in you amen and you knew the author and how to apply what's in it that's what's happening we don't realize it but we're getting the full application of the thoughts hebrews 4 12 an intense amen you say yeah brother but it hurts of course it hurts it's a two-edged sword but god's two-edged sword cuts while it's going in and heals well it's coming out and and and you say well i got a scar praise the lord you want that scars for that's for your memory while you're here and you and you have a memory that fights you in a conscience and affection and those five gates you've got to have something that you can look to and go i once was lost but now i'm found i got a grandson i probably told you this was a little boy and there was going to be a full eclipse and he wanted to go outside and look i had a welder's mask so i went out there and i looked up and i said wow that's really cool he comes outside and he looks up and he says man i said boy don't you be looking at this it was somebody else but he said don't you be looking at that son that'll blind you watch a three-year-old you think he'd known the author he said that's all right daddy he said we sing it all the time in church amazing grace how sweet this sound saved a rich like me i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see that's what this three-year-old kid said he didn't understand he was going to be blind but he wasn't sweating because you know he said well he's just a little kid be his little children you see that's we're not supposed to be immature we're supposed to allow our faith to be so simple and unobstructed that whatever god says it's truth this fact will come to pass and all i'm doing brothers and sisters you may not realize it yet but i'm preaching to you so that you can come to a conclusion of where you're at in him because it's not just a book you see it's that's why they're stumbling it's not just a recording amen there's an intent in there that's exactly right brother and you're hearing it right now why because every man's voice is his word brother branham said and if a man is espousing god's word and god hath placed him he's the voice of god but not the way you think oh god thinks he's no that's the whole point if he's a real man of god he won't think anything of himself he'll think he's chiefest of sinners that's right and paul already took that spot so i'm in the tribe can't be the chief because paul took it and paul said if you preach any other gospel than what i preach and i say okay paul you understand that's there's nothing wrong with second string i kind of like the bt should i keep going i've been here a long time i think haven't i brother wade come on oh you give me five ten is that ten okay i know i know you're not thank you yeah i'm not here to bore you i felt led to come here to enlighten you we need enlightening and i'm only preaching to you those things which god has revealed to me in simplicity this is not difficult because if it was we'd be in trouble now some of us are pretty sharp so we probably could but see your intellectual conceptions will do you no good at the end of the run because if somebody can talk you into it i'm telling you right now devil's got somebody to talk out of it it's got to become a heartfelt soul-saving okay i'll go a little further i've only made it two paragraphs if he was talking about this kind of book it would be like putting a strap across it's seven straps but it isn't this kind of a book it's a scroll oh man you brother chris you just spent 30 minutes telling us that it wasn't a book and brother brown says it's a scroll well do you know what scroll means i'll take a little less time because i want to get to something before this afternoon oh yeah i just get the dictionary out hang on scroll this is what we see when we hear scroll that's a symbol has a much much deeper greater meaning than this rolled up piece of paper but because it appeared in the form of symbols in vision to john john could only express the words that he understood it looks like a scroll to me that's because god wanted him to see a scroll but god doesn't want you and i to see a scroll because he's given us something that goes beyond this recognition a scroll from the word roll r-o-l-l and then the dictionary says see the word escrow i'll save that for this afternoon so then it begins to give us the definition of what john saw in symbol form he a roll of parchment paper etc usually with writing or pictures on it the second definition says an ancient book in the form of a rolled listen to the words that's used in the dictionary manuscript that comes from the word hand location location location you know i remember when i was a young man ray kroc the the guy who started the mcdonald's restaurant chain said he doesn't open up hamburger joints this is in his book he says i buy real estate wait a minute this is the guy that owns the mcdonald's restaurant chain i don't open up hamburger stands he says i buy real estate what did he mean i'm going to tell you what he meant because you can read it in his biography or his autobiography he said i pick out the very best location in any town i go to i don't care how much that piece of property costs i've got a team of guys that'll go in there and buy that piece of property for what its value is over or under inflated when walt disney was going to open up disney world in florida he had a third party agent who didn't know who he was hired through a middle agent to go look for the land because as soon as somebody said walt disney's looking for land the price just tripled brother and then everybody around that area would triple the price of that it makes sense location this is the where the term came from for the real estate industry it came from ray kroc so well how do you figure it out how do you figure out which piece of property to put your mcdonald's on he said location location location i want the best location i want the one that's easiest to get in out of now that's changed even the location mentality changed why because he's passed away disney world has changed disneyland has changed you want to talk about a diabolical corrupt institution because it's not owned by walt disney i think it's owned by abc and espn and all them other outfits sony yeah i'm not telling you not to go to disneyland but i'll tell you when the founder of something that he thinks is good for the people makes a decision it usually starts out right maybe you don't know this and i'm not promoting this i just want you to understand the nuances of god's word but did you know that william branham the prophet of the age mentions walt disney did you know there's a place where he says he's one of us do you look it up you find it you read it it's in there but he calls it walt's place [Laughter] see brothers and sisters we get we get so uptight we get so legalistical and fundamentalist about things that we can't see the forest for the trees but it's all laid out right here the word scroll at the end of the day looks like a rolled manuscript and watch where they got the definition from listen now careful a list of names i didn't make this up it's in the dictionary it came from a root word why so if you think about it if you think about the word scroll came from a a an action that required a list of names oh what john saw was deadly accurate what he explained he saw was a scroll but anybody who understood what the scroll represented knew that it wasn't a scroll literally it was a symbol what did it stand for what's the other half of the meaning a list of names makes perfect sense it's a book it's the lamb's book it's got names in it wait until you hear what the word name means well my name's bill and my name's bob and my name's chris and my name's wade and my name's that's right but that was given to you by your earthly parents now names have a meaning because if the name is meant to define the character of the person don't change your name unless it's ricky or elvis that's what the prophet said because he understood something ricky nelson and elvis presley were not being put down by god through his prophet brother branham was trying to express something about names and then it was revealed that those individuals became defined or watched now their name defined them saul to paul see what i'm saying started changing names in the bible why because god wanted there was something hidden in that in the old testament and in the bible it's written and it looks obvious well that's because this name meant this and this name means this oh now we're getting somewhere don't worry so much about your natural name it's the one that god put in that book what is my name then brother well you'll have to look into the book to see and you'll have to reference where you're at in the book and then you'll have to come to an understanding of where you are in that book well that's the reason why i feel like a big shot that's not what your name defines let's take jesus it was specific listen mary that which is born of thee is of the holy ghost and i've given the holy ghost a name jesus you'll call him jesus hmm better go see what that name means now the angel had his own little dictionary savior so that's why jesus could in in luke 4 going to the temple priest handed him the book he opened the book it didn't look like his name but he gave the definition of it that's right in isaiah but then he only read watch now half of verse two and stopped wait a minute how come he only read half of verse 2 he's all the word but he knew there was a prophetic class that was coming he knew john was going to be on the isle of patmos and john was going to be seeing symbols in the form of a vision because john didn't really know what was going on amen and he knew the definition of symbol requires another half i remember when i first the lord first showed this to me you mean the word of god and we are always informed to quote all the word and to finish every sentence and and here is the word himself stopping in the middle of a sentence what did he do that for well he did it because of the definition symbol a token of identity verified by comparing its other half oh that makes perfect sense to me now did you know what the other half of the sentence and the scripture that jesus did not read it's the bride but it was the day of judgment and he wasn't here that day you understand 2000 years ago was not the day of judgment it was a day of salvation but when john turned and the elder said behold the lion of the tribe of judah that elder knew judgment was fixing to take place you and me everybody else but something happened and in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts to the lamb he'd been sitting you know john couldn't see him the prophet said he'd been sitting where was he the prophet said back in the eternities and then he rose from the dead and stood up and said i've paid the price i've conquered it listen now and only those whose names are in that book now remember me telling you about collateral benefactors you may not realize this brothers and sisters but did you know that you were put here for one reason because if you were in him before the foundation of the world he can't lose you the way you and i think of lost well i once was lost but now i'm found do you think really god didn't know where you were at but those words are put in there in the form of a symbol so you and i could come to an understanding of the plan of god and we were and some of us still are lost but not lost like where's my pocket knife where's my car keys where's my cell phone lost as in separated put off to a distance but god knew exactly where you were going to come up in history in time he knew when you were going to be born he knew he knows when we're going to die if we die he knows everything about what's going to happen and brothers and sisters if you want more time on your deathbed be careful because there's an instance in the bible where the prophet said you're going to die tonight oh god i can't i'm not ready my family's not ready god heard it prophet turn around a prophet just does what he's told he didn't argue with god wait a minute i just told him that he was going to be condemned and now you want me to turn around and go turn around go back and tell him i'm going to give him 15 more years but god knew that's why brother branham uses that example and does god ever change his mind about his word no but you keep antagonizing him and you keep badging him and he'll say go ahead play in the street i know you're going to get killed but go ahead and play in the street you say well that's not a very this is the god of life he's not worried about you dying he's worried about you living i think i better stop i'll finish oh well i'll get a little further you love him please stand i got two paragraphs in my brothers and sisters it's god's word see there's no end to this there's no end to it god is good all the time amen i think i like to sing that not sure what key you played in cis but go ahead god is good all the time he put a song of praise in this heart of mind god is good all his light will shine god is good [Music] yes he is [Applause] [Music] god amen god is good all the time let's give our brother a hand the word of god was spoke to us today amen by a servant that's the way it's supposed to come not gonna get it any other way but you're gonna go home and chew on it for a while and then let god talk to you a little bit more a little bit more what we were talking about this morning you know there's only 66 books in the bible but i thought it was the eternal word of god amen there's only 66 books it's not it's not library volumes of books right 66 books but inside that 66 it's awful i forgot to turn them inside that they can hear me inside that book is living people that's right and that's what makes it eternal that's what makes eternal life like brother chris said you you take the ans and the butts and the these and the lucifers and uh and kane and you take all these people and you start pulling them out of the book what you got left you got the bride that's right that's all you got left and is us you've got the bride amen god bless you we love you with the love of the lord if you have a need we're just going to raise our hands if you want if you need prayer and we'll just pray today as we dismiss and be back at two o'clock this afternoon and he can just preach all night if he wants to that's fine with me but we need to go get a little bite to eat and come back together be praying for him amen for this second service yes that will be better than the first amen amen dear heavenly father lord we thank you for this day that you give us thank you for your servant lord this come lord and pour his heart out to us lord we know one thing's for sure we are creatures of time here but lord when we get into eternity lord we're not ever gonna have to say goodbye never gonna have to say i'm hungry i need to go get something to eat we're gonna set and feast around the word of god for an eternity 66 books of of a bible but the bible is not going to be in heaven people are going to be in heaven and lord i pray that you would be with us be with the ones that's raised their hands lord be the ones that are sick the ones we called out this morning the ones that are on the prayer list lord we pray that you'd be with each one father as we go eat a meal lord that will continue lord to put you first in everything we do father just give us this day our daily bread in jesus name we pray amen this light will shine god is good all the time through the darkest night his light will shine god is good oh god is good all the time [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] you
