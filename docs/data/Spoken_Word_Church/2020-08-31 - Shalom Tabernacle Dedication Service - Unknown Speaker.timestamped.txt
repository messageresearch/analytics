[34:08] i mean i mean i was in my twenties
[34:14] i was young and i thought i wasn't gonna
[34:16] say i'm forgetting
[34:18] but sam he had really been a friend and
[34:20] then he's
[34:21] been a real pastor figure also he'd been
[34:25] a real father figure
[34:28] i told him i had two people i would have
[34:31] considered
[34:32] doing my dedication for if john key
[34:35] would have been living he was
[34:36] being considered to be one he'd been a
[34:39] father figure

[37:46] all of you are family
[37:58] that's what we've gathered here for
[37:59] today and it'll be a little odd thing i
[38:02] guess because i'm just never done
[38:03] anything
[38:04] on the right schedule you know i i never
[38:08] had no
[38:09] certain way of doing anything uh if you
[38:11] try to tie me down they tied me down the
[38:13] other day at a wedding and
[38:15] and you know i kind of got through real
[38:17] fast because when they tied me down
[38:19] that's what i'd done
[38:21] if they'd elected and i'll send letters
[38:22] that was a short wedding
[38:24] but see they tied me down they told me
[38:26] what they wanted done
[38:28] brother fournier hadn't told what he was
[38:30] done so uh eight o'clock tonight we'll
[38:33] try to get around to the dedication
[38:35] all right all right all right
[38:39] amen but let's just go to the lord in
[38:41] prayer and then we'll read
[38:43] one little scripture and going to
[38:45] hebrews 10
[38:46] 5. father we thank you
[38:51] for your love and your grace and thank
[38:54] you for an opportunity
[38:56] to come here with our brothers and
[38:57] sisters in my precious faith
[39:00] and come to do what we've always thought
[39:02] about we'd love to do and that would be
[39:04] to
[39:05] just dedicate our brother a church
[39:07] somewhere
[39:08] that he'd be working on it because you
[39:10] know he
[39:11] he's done his part on the field and
[39:13] things and now maybe it's time to slow
[39:15] down a little bit and just
[39:17] stay at home and some go out some but
[39:19] just stay around his people and
[39:21] have a family together in your loving
[39:25] grace we love you and we thank you just
[39:27] bless each one bless the church at home
[39:28] there today and
[39:30] the brothers is our ministry and we ask
[39:32] you to just guide each one
[39:34] forgive our sins and lead us in that
[39:36] understanding in jesus name
[39:39] just one short scripture hebrews 10 5.
[39:44] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[39:47] he saith
[39:48] sacrifice and offerings our word is not
[39:52] but a body can stop a pirate thing yeah
[39:55] you may be seated
[39:59] lead us into what safety to you because
[40:03] you know there's been many things and
[40:05] we'll cover some and then we'll go into
[40:08] it
[40:08] and i have some prayer claws here and
[40:10] see what i want to do is
[40:12] when we get around to the ending of it
[40:13] we'll uh put them over the door
[40:16] posts and things or take them here in
[40:18] the under because i i believe in that
[40:21] my son was in the chicken business and
[40:23] uh
[40:24] terrence and he he he would take prayer
[40:27] cloths and stick them around you know
[40:30] when they come time to tear out some of
[40:32] it and
[40:33] get done everybody was laughing because
[40:35] every time they pulled something down a
[40:37] little fluff
[40:38] a little thing had come floating down it
[40:40] was a prayer cloth
[40:42] you know what he's done good in his
[40:43] business he was retired his 40s
[40:48] that was all right i guess so we can do
[40:50] that but we'll do those things
[40:52] right and do it but now there's been
[40:55] many times in the bible
[40:57] time to era period time or whatever that
[41:01] uh a place was provided for god
[41:04] to dwell right all right in each one of
[41:08] those times
[41:08] he came down
[41:12] and he you know vindicated that what
[41:15] they were doing was right
[41:17] he was happy about it right moses built
[41:20] it out of
[41:21] badger skins and things like that made a
[41:24] place and
[41:25] god came down you know and so then you
[41:28] see
[41:28] solomon comes along david wanted to
[41:30] provide but he couldn't do it
[41:32] but his son solomon took over and he he
[41:34] uh
[41:35] you know uh dedicated a building for god
[41:38] to dwell in
[41:39] and god came down in that building
[41:42] and and showed and proved that he was
[41:45] satisfied with what they were doing but
[41:48] see that was still not right
[41:50] that was still not the uh the place god
[41:53] wanted even though he was happy about
[41:55] doing it and all the things
[41:57] it was still not the right one because
[41:59] it was not to be some kind of a building
[42:02] you know of wood or stone or water or
[42:05] anything like that
[42:06] it was not to be that anyway but yet he
[42:09] was satisfied for the time
[42:12] and he he did then he came down and
[42:15] proved
[42:16] to them in his glory in the building
[42:19] you know you know the story that they
[42:20] wasn't even able to minister in things
[42:22] because
[42:23] the glory of the lord had filled the
[42:24] building right but the thing i
[42:27] you know i you say well what are you
[42:29] going to do what are you going to say
[42:31] well you know we know
[42:34] what the real uh building god wants to
[42:37] dwell in
[42:39] and that's in the body of his bride
[42:49] [Music]
[42:52] i'm not saying that i'm just saying that
[42:54] he's not as satisfied with
[42:56] a building situation something tangible
[42:59] is he is into the person that has
[43:02] had those things and he they've come and
[43:05] dedicated themselves
[43:07] to the lord see then i do believe that
[43:09] when
[43:10] the bride today walks out the door god
[43:13] doesn't just sit down here and say well
[43:15] all the way to wednesday
[43:18] he doesn't he goes with the people he
[43:21] goes out
[43:22] and he lives and he he manifested
[43:25] himself
[43:26] you know through you out there
[43:29] really we are the building that he
[43:31] wanted to have built
[43:35] we were the positional situation where i
[43:37] wanted to be
[43:38] you know in his right order and one day
[43:41] see he came on earth to prove it was
[43:43] right
[43:43] he came on earth in the form of a body
[43:47] because it was provided for him uh
[43:50] they gave the old testament it took all
[43:53] of that time
[43:54] the brother branham says the the the
[43:56] prophets built the body
[43:58] you know john came to be the the neck
[44:00] and the parts and then jesus being the
[44:02] head
[44:03] and then to bring him into manifestation
[44:08] and in suing so when he was walking on
[44:10] the shores of galilee
[44:11] there was the body yeah
[44:14] that's why it says the body now has
[44:16] prepared me now we don't believe in
[44:18] trinitarianism we believe in one true
[44:20] living
[44:21] so it's not two gods it's not a father
[44:24] providing a body for a son
[44:27] see brother ren said it like this he
[44:30] said he didn't send a son
[44:33] [Music]
[44:34] he said
[44:39] [Music]
[44:48] see then that was the situation he was
[44:50] pleased to dwell
[44:52] in that body you know
[44:55] and that's what he says there when he
[44:56] was baptized and thanked
[44:58] and come up you know and this is my
[44:59] beloved son and police as well
[45:02] he was pleased to do that he he wasn't
[45:05] uh
[45:06] it wasn't something to just say well
[45:08] i'll live here for a while
[45:10] because he'll never separate himself
[45:12] from that bodily form
[45:14] i'll talk about the body of the lord
[45:15] jesus he will always have that form
[45:19] that when we get over there we're not
[45:21] going to see a father here and a son
[45:22] here i don't want to go here
[45:24] i think we've got to figure it out now
[45:26] we're going to see jesus
[45:27] you know who he is because that's the
[45:30] body that he chose
[45:32] to come and dwell in all right and and
[45:35] that's wonderful
[45:36] because that was he said i'm pleased to
[45:37] dwell but do you realize
[45:39] the day he gave you the baptism of the
[45:42] holy ghost
[45:44] he was pleased to dwell in you amen
[45:48] he took up his abode i mean you yeah
[45:52] now now we know that uh god is not like
[45:55] cutting up an apple giving it out and
[45:56] you run out of pieces you know
[45:58] stuff like that now the more i like to
[46:00] express it this way
[46:01] the more god gives out of himself
[46:04] through giving
[46:05] new birth to the pilgrims other people
[46:07] the more he gives out
[46:08] the greater he becomes american the more
[46:12] uh what would you call it more more um
[46:16] he just becomes greater with each one
[46:18] okay that way he's dwelling where he
[46:20] wanted to do it
[46:23] see then we've come here today to
[46:25] dedicate a building which we will do
[46:28] and we'll do the things and we'll do all
[46:30] of that and because that's what we
[46:32] we came to do but the main thing is
[46:36] is a church see
[46:40] is the body of christ
[46:43] by the new birth coming and dwelling in
[46:45] each one of us
[46:47] he comes to that and it becomes christ
[46:49] in you
[46:50] paul would say the whole glory all right
[46:53] and see then now he has what he's always
[46:57] wanted
[46:58] you following me he was okay with with
[47:01] moses
[47:02] that was great and he came down
[47:06] and he anointed the place and done all
[47:08] the things it was great with
[47:10] when it comes to solomon and he gets to
[47:13] that and we'll
[47:14] we'll get to those things in the
[47:15] scripture but when he got to that place
[47:17] he was satisfied and he'd
[47:19] come in and dwell among the people and
[47:22] they couldn't even minister because
[47:24] of the glory of the lord that was over
[47:26] the doing
[47:27] but still that was not the happy time
[47:30] the happy time was when naturally
[47:33] speaking now
[47:35] the beginning of the creation of god
[47:36] amen what was that when jesus become in
[47:38] human flesh
[47:39] that's right at the beginning of the
[47:41] creation of god
[47:42] god came down in human flesh amen to
[47:46] dwell in us
[47:46] as a baby amen and he was pleased to be
[47:50] that little baby
[47:51] yes and i love it the way the prophet
[47:53] said it he said
[47:55] he he was jehovah crying in the crate
[47:59] that's right he said he was jehovah with
[48:01] no teeth
[48:04] because he was thanking him like us
[48:08] because that was the way he came he had
[48:10] to dwell into that flesh
[48:12] and and to do that but there was a day
[48:14] came that he had to do more than just
[48:16] stay in that flesh he had to come out of
[48:19] that place
[48:20] and divide himself among
[48:23] amen his people and he's been doing that
[48:25] now for 2 000 years
[48:27] dividing it and and the house of god is
[48:30] being prepared
[48:31] because you are the household yeah
[48:34] look at it and just consider yourself
[48:36] sitting in there
[48:37] and it's growing in grace and knowledge
[48:39] right you know add to your faith birth
[48:40] your knowledge
[48:41] of god you know he's him coming in you
[48:45] and doing more so he's pleased to dwell
[48:49] that's what i like he pleased to dwell
[48:52] in his people
[48:53] that's where he wanted to dwell not to
[48:55] just dwell
[48:56] with his people in the basis of him
[48:59] being over here
[49:00] and that's over here and that's that's
[49:02] wonderful that would be great
[49:03] but the main thing is he's dwelling in
[49:06] us
[49:07] and it finishes this situation of life
[49:10] as you call it
[49:11] and we all go to glory and children see
[49:14] then you'll see him
[49:16] what you'll see is his bride yeah amen
[49:19] amen and you know what she'll be she'll
[49:21] be the church amen
[49:23] of the living god amen that is the
[49:26] dwelling place
[49:27] of almighty god it won't be a building
[49:32] it won't be a building there that would
[49:33] have to all go to and we go down and
[49:34] we'll get out and worship now
[49:36] no he'll be right there with you and i
[49:39] all through the glory of time or
[49:40] whatever eternity
[49:42] can be and he'll be doing that because
[49:44] that's what i was reading the scripture
[49:46] for
[49:46] a body balance for prayer david yes so
[49:49] he's now
[49:50] happy to live in that but it's to the
[49:53] point of what
[49:54] i want us to think about for a minute
[49:56] because i said we come to dedicate a
[49:57] building we will do this
[49:59] but what good is it to dedicate a
[50:02] building
[50:03] when the people is not dedicated
[50:09] what's the purpose what do you want to
[50:13] [Music]
[50:15] uh bill gates i remember reading one
[50:17] time something like
[50:18] that he built a house it was like 15
[50:20] million dollars
[50:22] and it showed this great monstrosity
[50:24] sitting out there you know
[50:25] well that's good but my little house is
[50:28] satisfactory to me
[50:29] yes stay there i don't know i don't need
[50:32] no
[50:33] multi-million dollar home to live in
[50:36] well that's well and good
[50:37] night which i think the purpose
[50:40] is to see that we dedicate these bodies
[50:45] see then that way you're as an
[50:46] individual it's not us just going to
[50:48] dedicate a building okay we dedicate
[50:50] this we didn't hate the drones we
[50:51] dedicate it we dedicated
[50:54] okay glory we'll do that that's what we
[50:56] do
[50:57] because that's the part of life right
[50:59] right but the main thing is
[51:02] for you to dedicate yourself
[51:05] all right and educate yourself
[51:08] to the living god to be his dwelling
[51:12] place
[51:13] and then that way you can do it from a
[51:14] child that comprehends
[51:16] we don't know about what the age of
[51:17] accountability is it can be whatever you
[51:20] know
[51:21] but the age of accountability to me is
[51:24] when you're accountable
[51:26] and when you have a knowledge enough to
[51:27] know that you are that so then you
[51:29] children here today
[51:31] you have your part of being the body of
[51:33] christ
[51:34] so you accept jesus christ as your
[51:36] savior and you let him come and dwell in
[51:38] you
[51:40] and then you will grow and grow and grow
[51:42] and
[51:43] see you have your part right that way
[51:45] it's not just
[51:47] an old age time you know it's not that
[51:50] it it's for
[51:51] everything from the bottom of it all
[51:54] right
[51:54] to do to what to just build a body
[51:58] for god to dwell in is what went
[52:01] for amen and to do that it is to
[52:04] dedicate yourself
[52:07] [Music]
[52:10] he doesn't expect a lot out of us
[52:14] i love him because of that i never get
[52:17] to know my dad he
[52:18] he passed away when i was about four
[52:20] years old and i never i didn't get to
[52:22] know him
[52:23] you know in this world but a lot of
[52:26] people tell me that
[52:27] my family tell me that i look like him
[52:30] and everything you know and i got his
[52:32] name his name was sam and i'm samuel so
[52:35] you know there's things connected to my
[52:37] dad but i just never did get to know him
[52:39] that well
[52:40] but you see one day i found my real day
[52:44] hey
[52:50] you know and see i hope that he was my
[52:53] dad's dad because
[52:54] you know that's up to him afterwards and
[52:57] god to be that part himself
[52:59] but yet all i want to do is just be what
[53:01] i'm supposed to do
[53:04] it's nothing i don't want it i could
[53:06] have riches i i had opportunities in
[53:08] life to do
[53:09] to take this job or that job or whatever
[53:12] i wanted you know
[53:13] and become uh you know uh maybe
[53:17] with money uh but that was not my choice
[53:20] right it was never my choice to do that
[53:23] right it was my choice to dedicate my
[53:26] life
[53:31] but you know what i asked the lord what
[53:32] he wanted me to do and he said
[53:34] um you know going back to work so i'd
[53:37] ask him how about working at general
[53:39] motors
[53:40] you know and uh he just told me going
[53:43] back to work
[53:44] well he didn't tell me what he's gonna
[53:45] do i was already
[53:47] involved in a situation of understanding
[53:50] a little bit about the message and
[53:52] hearing about it and things you know but
[53:53] it began to unfold
[53:56] as i begin to live in my life and commit
[53:59] my life to him
[54:01] my father began to take over and you
[54:03] know what he began to bring in different
[54:05] ones so he brought in a lot of the
[54:06] brothers from
[54:07] from the plant that we worked at he
[54:10] brought them into the message or the
[54:12] hour
[54:13] you know and they're there in the church
[54:16] today some have passed on
[54:17] and you know but yet they're they're
[54:20] they're part of the body of christ
[54:32] looking for god and you know that you're
[54:35] the only god they'll ever see yeah
[54:38] hey you know they're not going to see
[54:40] them out here
[54:41] but they ain't going to see them now you
[54:43] know what i'm saying they're not going
[54:44] to see them in these great big buildings
[54:45] right right
[54:46] right now oh that's well and good i mean
[54:48] they have a multi-million dollar church
[54:50] i could have with the church at lula
[54:53] could have been a
[54:55] places of a better situation than what
[54:57] we are
[54:58] and i like that we could have been to
[55:00] where that we could have a nice building
[55:02] we could have paid for it not but we
[55:04] chose to send our money out to
[55:06] help the missionaries and the things and
[55:09] to do a little bit for them you know
[55:11] instead of taking it and using it for
[55:13] ourselves right
[55:14] we'll see that i think that's what my
[55:16] father wanted us to do
[55:18] you know he wanted wants to go out and
[55:19] do all these other things right if he do
[55:21] this otherwise i praise god
[55:24] i have a wonderful time in my christian
[55:26] experience
[55:27] because i'm always as i did back when i
[55:30] was working at
[55:31] general motor and i was what they call
[55:32] an absentee replacement in other words
[55:35] you were
[55:35] you had a job but my job was not
[55:38] assigned
[55:39] but my job was to if you was out of work
[55:41] then i would run your job that day
[55:43] i was just announcing deal replacement
[55:45] well you know every day i'd say lord
[55:46] where am i going
[55:48] yeah i said okay now daddy what are we
[55:50] going to do today
[55:53] well some days it was just a normal day
[55:56] you know i just went through a day
[55:58] building cars
[55:59] putting on her putting on wheels putting
[56:01] on this and putting off
[56:03] all kinds of things and being done and
[56:05] uh setting motors taking swing it around
[56:07] set it down in the car
[56:08] bolt it down do that i do my job but
[56:11] then some days
[56:14] you know i start talking maybe like one
[56:17] guy did one day and he said
[56:19] if you believed in prophets me and you
[56:21] could talk today
[56:27] but he just made that mistake yeah
[56:30] that's right
[56:30] and he said we could talk today if you
[56:33] believe in prayer i said would you
[56:34] proceed i said i believe just a little
[56:36] bit
[56:38] so i didn't want to i didn't want to you
[56:41] know beat him too hard
[56:42] right
[56:45] and tell him i knew more about prophets
[56:47] than he'd ever think about
[56:49] but you know i didn't want to do that so
[56:50] i just said okay
[56:52] and my point is i would just say lord
[56:54] what do you want me to do
[57:01] bothered me about working it's always
[57:03] been part of my life
[57:04] let's see i was just trying to dedicate
[57:07] my life
[57:08] to be something you know that someone
[57:12] else would
[57:13] love to follow that or to you know
[57:16] walk in those footsteps because that's
[57:18] what you're doing when you're dedicating
[57:20] yourself
[57:21] i see children that's where you you
[57:23] you're dedicating yourself to just
[57:25] not to do nothing but just be yourself
[57:28] right let's not ask a lot
[57:29] right you're not asked a whole lot to do
[57:31] with children
[57:32] amen that's where i see the parents
[57:35] going wrong you know they try to make
[57:37] the children do right and they won't be
[57:38] right
[57:45] you know you want the kids to do right
[57:47] but you don't want to do right in front
[57:48] of them
[57:49] i've always believed let's just do it
[57:50] this way i've always felt
[57:52] that way you know the work that i didn't
[57:55] beat the kids about what they were doing
[57:57] i just tried to encourage them to do
[57:59] that and always encourage them
[58:01] uh our requirement was in life was the
[58:04] children were to get a high school
[58:05] education
[58:06] yes sir that was a requirement because
[58:08] you can't exist in this life without
[58:10] harassment
[58:11] and that was my my goal you know was to
[58:14] make sure they got a high school
[58:15] education
[58:16] but after that that's left up to them
[58:19] wade had an opportunity he was in
[58:20] college he could have went on
[58:22] kept going uh terence had a college
[58:24] offer to it
[58:25] anna wound up being a school teacher and
[58:28] you know and doing the different things
[58:29] and all
[58:30] and they were doing it but i wanted them
[58:32] to at least get that first part of the
[58:34] education because in my day you wouldn't
[58:37] understand it you're not old enough to
[58:39] understand i'm talking about the message
[58:40] people
[58:41] when i started in this message thing
[58:43] there was people that was making their
[58:45] kids
[58:45] take them out of school in georgia and
[58:47] send them to alabama
[58:53] [Music]
[58:55] well brother branham was against
[58:57] children getting an education
[59:03] i said best i can remember um
[59:06] brother perry green wound up meeting
[59:09] uh billy paul in college
[59:16] and you got time enough to talk a little
[59:18] bit about that
[59:20] denominational college and billy paul
[59:24] let his son go to a denomination
[59:30] check it out
[59:34] see he wanted him to get an education
[59:36] that's right he wasn't against us
[59:38] getting an education
[59:40] right let's see it's all part of our
[59:42] growing okay
[59:44] so then we've come today to do that one
[59:47] thing let's dedicate
[59:48] ourselves
[59:52] to the living god to
[59:56] to do what he wants us to do live the
[59:59] way he wants us to do
[1:00:01] and he's never asked nothing out of us
[1:00:03] that he wouldn't do himself
[1:00:06] that's one way you can find out what's
[1:00:08] true or not but if you think you
[1:00:10] if you think the lord is okay with you
[1:00:12] to do certain let's say to say some of
[1:00:14] your sisters and say well i think the
[1:00:15] lord says all right if we'd cut my heart
[1:00:17] we'll just go see me
[1:00:20] talking about him i'm talking about hope
[1:00:22] to see what he said about it in the
[1:00:23] world
[1:00:26] see it all comes out to where that we
[1:00:28] can follow him and walk
[1:00:30] in the line so then the first thing
[1:00:34] is for the church here together to
[1:00:37] dedicate
[1:00:38] themselves yes you have a pastor a
[1:00:41] wonderful brother
[1:00:43] and all and you just back him up
[1:00:46] you stand behind him and you you keep
[1:00:49] him
[1:00:50] in in your prayers constantly
[1:00:54] that's to do it he just he's in my
[1:00:57] prayer every day amen
[1:00:58] all of these sicknesses and we've prayed
[1:01:00] with him and been with him and
[1:01:02] associated and we still keep doing that
[1:01:04] you know because we pray for one another
[1:01:06] and say lord
[1:01:08] all right now you know what's needed and
[1:01:10] i i like this about the lord you know
[1:01:12] the lord he's i'm absent-minded okay i'm
[1:01:15] 80 years old i'm outside-minded
[1:01:19] all right but he's not
[1:01:23] you ever thought about i can pray for
[1:01:24] everybody in this building right here
[1:01:27] and the way i can praise it lord bless
[1:01:29] the church yes

[1:01:35] lord
[1:01:36] now you know what we need yes you know
[1:01:39] what it is and you know the situation
[1:01:41] so i don't have to but i do i go a lot
[1:01:44] of times at the church and i'll go down
[1:01:45] the pews
[1:01:46] i mean in my prayers i pray for
[1:01:49] everybody individually
[1:01:51] but a lot of times like this i'm like i
[1:01:54] remember seeing this one time and
[1:01:56] and uh a guy said well lord bless his
[1:01:58] food amen and of course that's that next
[1:02:00] thing he said
[1:02:01] hey that was a short prayer he said god
[1:02:03] knows i'm hungry
[1:02:07] sometimes i'm sleepy i'm worn out i'm
[1:02:09] tired
[1:02:10] that's the lord you know the children
[1:02:13] right then the next time i'll go down
[1:02:15] the aisle
[1:02:24] and that way that i keep my prayers
[1:02:26] constant
[1:02:27] to everybody and do it because i believe
[1:02:30] in it
[1:02:31] and that way we can do so you pray for
[1:02:33] your passion tonight

[1:05:08] saying how much happier could your
[1:05:10] father be
[1:05:12] for you to do out from
[1:05:15] from within your heart amen from with
[1:05:19] inside of you
[1:05:20] do you just say lord we're going to make
[1:05:23] this church work
[1:05:25] we're going to argue about what that's
[1:05:27] right
[1:05:30] where we come from what went on
[1:05:33] you know or what they're doing down
[1:05:34] there right you know brother
[1:05:37] can tell you where we're sitting at the
[1:05:38] church a hundred feet over is another
[1:05:41] church
[1:05:43] like just a hundred feet over is another
[1:05:45] church there's a church that's there
[1:05:47] you say well don't you
[1:05:53] going the other way i'd certainly rather
[1:05:56] just see a church there
[1:05:57] than to see if you're going yeah or
[1:05:59] anything
[1:06:00] but yet we get along we're happy
[1:06:02] together there you know
[1:06:03] and and all to do it because we're not
[1:06:06] trying to
[1:06:07] to do that i i i'm sorry i see
[1:06:11] that most ministers are trying to beat
[1:06:14] people into
[1:06:15] understanding salvation or trying to
[1:06:18] be a church or be whatever it is and
[1:06:21] they're trying to force you
[1:06:22] into it by their ways and means of their
[1:06:25] doing
[1:06:27] what does it matter what brother
[1:06:30] so-and-so does that's
[1:06:36] [Applause]
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:45] and i don't mean it's wrong because see
[1:06:47] you can take it and make a reflection
[1:06:48] so don't make nothing just tell me what
[1:06:50] i'm saying right you know that may be
[1:06:51] the
[1:06:51] the the the fact of what god wanted
[1:06:57] maybe he wanted brother pawnee out here
[1:06:59] with just a small amount of people
[1:07:02] compared to where he come out of a
[1:07:04] church with a lot of people
[1:07:07] and see that may be god's word
[1:07:10] that's right yes all right you know we
[1:07:14] at the church we we've dedicated
[1:07:16] churches and things to them
[1:07:17] and we did well in tennessee one time
[1:07:19] and dedicated a church
[1:07:21] and turned around and there was one two
[1:07:23] three preachers
[1:07:24] and uh about 10 or 12 15 maybe
[1:07:28] people and and the thing that i said see
[1:07:30] they were driving down
[1:07:31] to the church blue and i told them i
[1:07:34] said listen
[1:07:35] as of this day i am not your pastor
[1:07:39] i sit down to this day
[1:07:42] this brother here is your pastor i said
[1:07:45] because i'm turning you
[1:07:47] over to him you know i mean for you
[1:07:50] to come back here and have it there's no
[1:07:52] need to drive in 200 miles
[1:07:55] you know one way to just get to come to
[1:07:56] church with us you just come here
[1:08:00] we'll see you i didn't mean i i hope
[1:08:03] that you didn't think i was running the
[1:08:04] ball
[1:08:05] you know but i hope they didn't think i
[1:08:06] was trying to win them either
[1:08:09] and that's the way brother forney is he
[1:08:11] just just
[1:08:12] stay with him and watch him and just
[1:08:15] walk behind him
[1:08:17] and just follow his footsteps and
[1:08:20] watching his wives are doing and seeing
[1:08:21] it he don't throw off one of these
[1:08:23] people down here
[1:08:24] he don't throw up on these other
[1:08:25] churches he just tries to be what he's
[1:08:28] supposed to be man
[1:08:30] that's the servant of god amen that's
[1:08:32] someone who has dedicated their life
[1:08:34] to almighty god to be what he wants him
[1:08:37] to be
[1:08:39] and then i know brother forney well
[1:08:41] enough to know that if one of those
[1:08:42] brothers or somebody that maybe has done
[1:08:44] this
[1:08:45] if they wanted to come over talk to him
[1:08:47] he'd be glad to have him do anything
[1:08:50] because that's just that's just for
[1:08:51] another people yeah because that's what
[1:08:53] we're supposed to be
[1:08:55] you know we're supposed to be the body
[1:08:58] of christ

[1:10:07] forward
[1:10:09] just hear the prayers of your people
[1:10:13] solomon got there to the point
[1:10:16] that we'll read in just a second that he
[1:10:19] he got to a point and he said lord
[1:10:25] if you're people anywhere yes sir
[1:10:28] get in any kind of trouble anything
[1:10:32] the lord you hear from this temple here
[1:10:35] they they turn their eyes yes
[1:10:39] and look at you yeah and they're old
[1:10:44] jonah in the belly of the whale he
[1:10:46] didn't know what was right left or
[1:10:48] whatever it was
[1:10:50] but he was just thinking in his mind and
[1:10:52] he said
[1:10:53] i'm in a problem he said but solomon
[1:10:57] said
[1:10:57] if i turn my eyes towards that table
[1:11:01] that you would hear yeah
[1:11:04] he turned his eyes and he said in the
[1:11:05] direction and he said he's right that
[1:11:07] away
[1:11:09] and he was delivered he was set free
[1:11:12] because he done what you said you heard
[1:11:15] from that temple
[1:11:18] and you directed him to safety
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:22] we dedicate these people here to your
[1:11:24] lord
[1:11:34] just dedicate themselves to you
[1:11:38] lord and you accept that dedication
[1:11:42] and you just have your way and you make
[1:11:44] it to be a church sitting on a little
[1:11:46] hill
[1:11:47] there's a lot for the world they can see
[1:11:49] you
[1:11:50] we'll all be together on that day we
[1:11:54] thank you
[1:11:55] we committed to you now father in jesus
[1:11:58] name
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:02] or whatever because now we're going to
[1:12:04] dedicate a building because
[1:12:06] uh let's see let's read this
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:13] it's really taken from first kings
[1:12:16] 91 and it came to pass when solomon had
[1:12:21] finished the building of the house of
[1:12:24] the lord
[1:12:26] in the king's house and all the
[1:12:27] thanksgiving right
[1:12:30] all solomon's desire which he was
[1:12:32] pleased to do
[1:12:34] you know first kings nine and one
[1:12:39] then the lord appeared to solomon the
[1:12:41] second time as he had appeared unto
[1:12:43] him and gibeon and the lord said unto
[1:12:47] him
[1:12:48] i have heard thy prayer thy supplication
[1:12:53] the child is made before me i have
[1:12:57] hallowed this house
[1:12:58] which thou has built to put my name
[1:13:02] there
[1:13:04] forever and my eyes and my heart
[1:13:07] shall be there perpetually and he goes
[1:13:10] on to do as i said
[1:13:12] he says now lord
[1:13:16] i'm saying back to you
[1:13:20] if these people hear a prayer
[1:13:24] if they got a prayer and they're off in
[1:13:25] their own place or doing something wrong
[1:13:27] or
[1:13:27] in situations and they
[1:13:30] did you hear you here
[1:13:34] amen you answered their prayers
[1:13:37] and you come and fight their battles
[1:13:39] that's right
[1:13:40] you know that's what he did he said well
[1:13:43] do we have to look at a building well
[1:13:45] that's what i'm talking about right
[1:13:46] we're we're getting it in the wrong
[1:13:48] direction we think we've got to but they
[1:13:50] had to have a natural
[1:13:52] that's right but we're the spiritual
[1:13:55] building yeah
[1:13:56] you get in trouble just call
[1:14:01] my phone's never busy that way it's
[1:14:03] called you get in trouble just call your
[1:14:05] pastor and say that
[1:14:06] you're okay i've got a problem that's
[1:14:08] right
[1:14:10] he's promised when you hear and give an
[1:14:12] answer
[1:14:16] so let's just do a little dedication
[1:14:17] it's kind of an odd way i like to do
[1:14:19] but that's reason we've brought these we
[1:14:21] brought some prayer problems
[1:14:23] so i said my lord what are you going to
[1:14:24] do with all them i said well i ain't
[1:14:26] going to give
[1:14:27] everybody in the building one and but
[1:14:29] you can have them if you want them i
[1:14:30] mean
[1:14:31] we'll lay these up here and whatever is
[1:14:33] left over brother you can keep them and
[1:14:35] you know and if you want to if you want
[1:14:37] to pick up one of these prayer claws and
[1:14:39] put it your billfold i'd suggest
[1:14:44] uh our kids were uh set to one time wait
[1:14:49] he had a rat hole you know you know what
[1:14:51] a rat hole is to him
[1:14:52] you know for rats but he had a place in
[1:14:56] his billboard
[1:14:57] that we called her at home what that
[1:15:00] raffle was and he'll show you right now
[1:15:03] he's got some money sticking in that rat
[1:15:05] hole oh
[1:15:06] all right okay now see i always give it
[1:15:10] to him
[1:15:11] he said okay now here's you enough money
[1:15:14] 20 bucks i didn't get it
[1:15:19] give them a 20 bucks since they put it
[1:15:21] in a rat hole you get out on the road
[1:15:23] you can't get home
[1:15:27] you don't have to call me you got 20 to
[1:15:30] play somebody else
[1:15:44] you know now naturally when anna got
[1:15:46] along it was a little more natural yeah
[1:15:48] they like to rub us about that one but
[1:15:50] anna comes on up she gets a little
[1:15:52] different you know
[1:15:55] but anyhow my point is
[1:16:00] that's your prayer club yes sir he's
[1:16:03] taking one page made it up right
[1:16:11] that's generally the first thing that
[1:16:12] you're working with is built for
[1:16:15] i'd say if you want one take and pin it
[1:16:17] to your face
[1:16:19] if you're taking a look at the head of
[1:16:20] our bed you'll see a prayer bomb
[1:16:23] you go in there and i suggest you i do
[1:16:25] these things
[1:16:26] i'm honest tell you there's a prayer
[1:16:29] cloth
[1:16:31] stuck over our medicine cabinet
[1:16:37] why not sanctify your medicine
[1:16:46] put that prayer cloth in the medicine
[1:16:49] cabinet
[1:16:50] put it in your bible put it in
[1:16:53] absolutely
[1:16:54] and just say thank you lord amen
[1:16:58] you'll see we can tell testimonies of
[1:17:00] people
[1:17:01] you know all forms were that they'd say
[1:17:05] this i remember one years ago with these
[1:17:07] people
[1:17:08] this uh lady was in prison
[1:17:11] and uh somebody had sent her a prayer
[1:17:13] cloth
[1:17:15] well you know it was kind of rough in
[1:17:17] the prison and things
[1:17:18] and this other lady she said well i just
[1:17:20] can't sleep she said well i feel good
[1:17:22] said i i've got this prayer call
[1:17:24] he said let me let me borrow she
[1:17:27] borrowed a prayer claw put it on her
[1:17:28] went to bed once the sleeves left all
[1:17:30] night but you know what happened the one
[1:17:32] that gave the prayer call to it didn't
[1:17:33] sleep
[1:17:36] she just needed two of them i'm saying
[1:17:39] this about prayer club i believe in it
[1:17:42] i believe in prayer claws i believe in
[1:17:45] keeping them in my billfold
[1:17:47] keeping them in everything i've got and
[1:17:49] if you
[1:17:50] you know you do it put a prayer cloth
[1:17:52] back that's right
[1:17:55] pray and say thank you lord because
[1:17:58] that's what we're doing tomorrow
[1:17:59] so if you want to come by and do these
[1:18:01] if the brothers will some of them
[1:18:03] take two or three of these and and uh
[1:18:06] you know we don't have to you can annoy
[1:18:08] them with all if you want to because
[1:18:09] we've already been prayed over
[1:18:11] yes and they already have been anointed
[1:18:12] but if you would take them and
[1:18:14] and put them some way over the door
[1:18:16] brother one he could do that later or
[1:18:18] whatever
[1:18:19] and uh just put him up over the door the
[1:18:21] other day when that virus
[1:18:24] drove
[1:18:31] when that when that thing struck
[1:18:36] everybody was talking about this on the
[1:18:38] other the first thing i done is went to
[1:18:40] the prayer claw
[1:18:42] and i put one over these dope here
[1:18:47] i can tell you stories about the prayer
[1:18:48] clock we have a chiropractor that we go
[1:18:51] to
[1:18:51] and uh it's kind of hard to pray because
[1:18:53] you have to pray for somebody to get
[1:18:55] sick where the chiropractor can make
[1:18:56] living
[1:18:58] it's hard to pray sometimes but it's
[1:18:59] true but anyhow
[1:19:01] they told us that we're our business is
[1:19:04] really bad
[1:19:05] y'all pray for it i said okay i'll just
