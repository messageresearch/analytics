[2:14] crying loud spare night lift up that
[2:17] voice like a trumpet and show my people
[2:21] their transgressions and the house of
[2:23] jacob their sins
[2:30] [Music]
[2:43] wherefore have we fasted
[2:47] say they
[2:48] and thou she is not
[2:50] wherefore have we afflicted our souls
[2:53] and thou taketh no knowledge
[2:56] behold in the day
[2:58] of your faith we find pleasant pleasure
[3:01] and exalt
[3:02] all your labors
[3:07] and faith
[3:19] is such a fast that i have chosen a day
[3:23] for a man to afflict his soul
[3:26] is it to bow down your head and
[3:31] perish and know
[3:33] into space
[3:35] sack love and ashes
[3:37] unto him
[3:39] will thou be able to
[3:42] the lord
[3:53] and to let the oppressor free
[3:56] and that he break every
[3:58] hope is it not to deal thy bread to the
[4:03] hungry
[4:04] and that thou
[4:06] bring poor that are cast out of thy
[4:09] house
[4:10] when thou seeth the naked
[4:13] thou
[4:14] covet him
[4:16] and that thou
[4:18] had not
[4:20] thy self from thy own
[4:27] and flesh help shall spread forth
[4:29] speedingly and thy righteousness shall
[4:32] come before thee
[4:33] the glory of the lord shall be our
[4:36] reward
[4:38] then
[4:39] shall thou call the lord shall answer
[4:43] thou shalt cry and he shall hear
[4:47] and he shall say here i am if thou take
[4:50] away from the midst of
[4:52] thee seek the yoke
[4:55] of the putting forth of that finger and
[4:57] speaking vanity
[5:03] and satisfy the inflicted soul
[5:06] then shall the light
[5:08] rise and thy darkness
[5:10] [Music]
[5:13] and the lord shall guide thee
[5:16] continually
[5:17] and satisfy thy soul in drought
[5:21] and make fast the bone thou shall
[5:25] be like a watered garden and like a
[5:28] spring of water
[5:30] whose water fell not
[5:35] [Music]
[5:50] if thou turn away thy foot from the
[5:52] sabbath
[5:55] from doing thy pleasure of my holy day
[5:58] and call the sabbath a delight
[6:02] be holy of the lord
[6:04] honorable and thou
[6:07] and shall
[6:08] on him
[6:10] not doing thine own ways
[6:13] not finding
[6:15] that own pleasure not seeking that own
[6:18] words then shall thou delight thyself in
[6:22] the lord
[6:24] and i will call thee to rise upon the
[6:26] high places of the earth
[6:28] and feed thee inheritance not bring
[6:31] their father

[15:01] back up here okay
[15:03] man
[15:04] so um and i'd like to i'd like to read
[15:06] this quote i was thinking about it this
[15:08] morning
[15:10] in the smyrna church ages now they don't
[15:12] have it but i'm going to read it here
[15:13] for you it says all too little time is
[15:16] spent on laboring for the eternal
[15:17] rewards of god
[15:19] the recompense of god is too lightly
[15:21] esteemed
[15:22] if we believe in the reality of the
[15:25] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[15:27] kingdom of substance
[15:30] then we ought to lay up in heaven those
[15:32] good treasures that are available
[15:34] to the faithful saints
[15:36] that are available
[15:38] the treasure's already laid up a little
[15:41] too little time is spent on laboring for
[15:42] the eternal
[15:44] rewards of god so
[15:46] um just admonish you that
[15:48] um
[15:49] bible study is really good for you
[15:52] it's better for you than anything else
[15:53] you can be doing on saturday night amen
[15:56] so um i i and i've always said if you
[15:58] have a position in this church you ought
[16:01] to be at bible study
[16:03] that's the spiritual leadership of the
[16:05] church
[16:06] so if you have anything to do i admonish
[16:08] you to be here i know we don't have
[16:09] there's times when we can't come
[16:11] but some of y'all have never come
[16:13] so
[16:14] so you know you ought to make you're
[16:16] trying to make an effort
[16:17] because god's made it available
[16:19] god's gonna tell you one day he's to say
[16:21] look i made it available for you
[16:23] why are you crying
[16:24] why are you crying because you've not
[16:26] come to adoption why are you crying
[16:27] because you can't get what you need to
[16:28] get well let's do what god says
[16:31] try at least try
[16:33] to do what god says amen so let's just
[16:35] keep that in prayer bible studies every
[16:38] saturday i mean the first saturday of

[17:33] well it's a long time away well it's
[17:35] really not
[17:37] hey man october is here now too you
[17:38] remember so uh
[17:40] um we'll be announcing what's night
[17:42] service and we just got over announcing
[17:43] it just a few weeks ago i thought so
[17:46] we're going to speak today we're going
[17:47] to start a new subject i told you we
[17:49] were going to try to do this we're going
[17:50] to take our time but who is this son of
[17:53] man
[17:55] now we're going to have to we're going
[17:56] to have to background you know that
[17:57] we're going to have to background
[18:00] that's what we were kind of talking
[18:01] about in bible study last night
[18:04] we've had some real good background here
[18:06] so having good background here we can
[18:08] understand
[18:09] uh some of the people were talking about
[18:10] the statue of a perfect man and how to
[18:12] get the virtues and and
[18:15] you know sometimes
[18:16] sometimes i think
[18:18] remember god does it
[18:21] he reveals it
[18:23] and then he makes it manifest that's
[18:24] what the prophet of god said he does it
[18:26] so he's already doing a work in you
[18:28] don't think you're insignificant don't
[18:30] think you're not you know i mean it's a
[18:32] struggle we were talking about the
[18:33] kingdom of god is taken by force
[18:36] you got to press your way into this
[18:38] but in that we press our way into it we
[18:41] could be already in it listen how long
[18:43] was brother biscuit in that vision
[18:46] hours before he realized he was actually
[18:49] walking in the vision that brother
[18:51] branham had told him weeks before or a
[18:52] week before or a couple days before they
[18:54] start hunting he said to be a man of the
[18:56] green chicken shirt he took that shirt
[18:58] out and put it on he went hunting
[19:00] and he realized that he was already in
[19:03] the vision
[19:04] so let us i want god to show us
[19:07] that we either are in these virtues
[19:10] or we've already got in them but lord
[19:12] reveal to me where i'm at reveal to me
[19:15] what i'm already doing because he does
[19:17] it
[19:18] then he reveals it then he makes it
[19:20] manifest all right so he's got to do it
[19:22] in your life reveal it to you that he's
[19:25] done it and then make it manifest by you
[19:27] showing it out we were talking about
[19:28] virtue you know if you get a revelation
[19:30] today and you had a you had a question
[19:32] or you had a a thought that was contrary
[19:34] to god and then god gives you a
[19:36] revelation today
[19:38] that gives you that right there that
[19:40] gives you virtue and knowledge
[19:42] packed together because what you do it
[19:44] may it gives you strength and then you
[19:45] can what you can give it out to somebody
[19:47] else
[19:48] because that's what virtue is is
[19:49] strength not being a virgin and be a
[19:52] virgin every day in your life and die
[19:53] and go to hell but you can't have godly
[19:55] virtue
[19:57] because you got to have the new birth to
[19:58] get godly virtue amen so it puts you in
[20:00] the body of christ so just remember
[20:01] those things
[20:03] because that is the son of man right
[20:05] there
[20:07] that's the whole thing that's the
[20:08] headstone he is the son of man there he
[20:11] is there we know he came in the end time
[20:13] but we're going to try to walk our way
[20:15] through the bible
[20:16] because he started
[20:18] before the beginning of time
[20:21] and he's ending up now not ending but
[20:23] we're seeing the end of things that are
[20:26] being prophesied
[20:28] in the bible all right and and keep this
[20:31] in your mind that when we're even
[20:33] we talk about the old testament
[20:35] uh listen to me we thought we were
[20:37] talking about the old testament
[20:39] you say well that's jehovah
[20:42] but now listen all the old testament
[20:45] prophesied
[20:47] of the son of man
[20:49] it doesn't matter if it's jehovah or or
[20:52] or whatever you want to call it the
[20:54] father
[20:56] he every scripture how many scriptures
[20:58] did jesus fulfill he fulfilled all the
[21:01] old testament
[21:03] when he when he stood on earth as what
[21:05] the son of man so the whole old
[21:09] testament don't don't kick it out and
[21:11] say well when the son of man start well
[21:12] he started 2000 years ago in bethlehem
[21:15] no he started before the foundation of
[21:17] the world because we're going to read
[21:18] where brother brown says who is this son
[21:19] of man he says in the beginning
[21:22] in the beginning was the word amen so
[21:24] let's bow our heads
[21:27] as we get started just keep everybody in
[21:28] your prayers uh sister jim today she is
[21:31] uh
[21:32] um um our future daughter-in-law is
[21:35] having something um special at her
[21:37] church and she wanted they wanted the
[21:38] mother-in-law's there so our future
[21:40] mother-in-law so james at her church now
[21:43] with her so she has to do that so just
[21:44] keep him in prayer
[21:46] heavenly father we thank you lord to
[21:48] this day
[21:49] that you give us not just a day a 24
[21:51] hour day but do i do appreciate lord
[21:53] that you give us a time of day to set
[21:55] aside the first day of the week lord to
[21:57] honor the resurrection
[21:58] and lord may there be a resurrection in
[22:00] our heart lord and in our life and the
[22:02] ones lord that are standing here before
[22:03] us
[22:04] the ones lord that are watching in
[22:06] father we pray that you will just anoint
[22:07] each one lord for our journey
[22:09] we're on a special time now lord we're
[22:11] in a time where
[22:12] we're coming into the manifestation of
[22:15] the sons of god and we're not going to
[22:17] be children
[22:19] adopted
[22:21] children to begin with yes but now
[22:24] brother brown says maturity
[22:26] mature sons and daughters of god to know
[22:28] what god wants done with the word
[22:30] not being frivolous and not being a baby
[22:33] anymore lord but knowing what to do with
[22:34] this word lord that you give us
[22:36] father we pray that you'd be with each
[22:38] one thank you for helping our pastor
[22:40] lord strengthen him more and more and
[22:42] more and more lord that you'll touch his
[22:44] body lord
[22:45] and be with each one of us lord touch
[22:47] the body here the body of christ
[22:49] lord the ones that are sick father the
[22:51] ones that are not here the ones that are
[22:52] traveling ones that are coming in and
[22:54] going father we pray that you just bless
[22:56] each one we are truly a chosen elect
[22:58] group of people and i pray that you just
[23:00] give us lord the promises that you've
[23:02] told us you would give us
[23:04] and today we are here to receive them in
[23:06] the name of the lord jesus christ amen
[23:09] all right let's go john 1
[23:11] verse 1.
[23:12] everybody all right
[23:14] amen we're going to we're going to talk
[23:15] about the son of man but we got to talk
[23:17] about how it got started
[23:20] because what is the son of man bottom
[23:22] line
[23:23] it's the word made flesh
[23:26] okay the total now the son of man is the
[23:28] total word made flesh the headstone man
[23:31] not just us as a baby no it's the
[23:32] headstone man all right so in the
[23:34] beginning was the word
[23:37] the word was with god
[23:39] and the word was god so they're not
[23:41] separate
[23:42] the same was in the beginning with god
[23:46] all things were made by him
[23:50] all things
[23:51] were made by him and without him was not
[23:54] anything made that was made
[23:57] in him was life and the life was the
[23:59] light of men
[24:01] and the light shineth in darkness and
[24:02] the darkness comprehended not
[24:05] there was a man sent from god whose name
[24:06] was john
[24:08] now this is john the baptist
[24:10] the same came for a witness to bear
[24:11] witness of the light that all men
[24:14] through him might believe because see he
[24:16] introduced the son of man
[24:18] behold the lamb of god flesh
[24:21] that takes away the sin of the world so
[24:23] that was john's job he didn't come to he
[24:25] didn't come to announce the holy ghost
[24:29] he come to announce a man in human flesh
[24:31] that was going to take away the sin of
[24:32] the world that god was going to come
[24:34] down here and walk in human flesh behold
[24:37] the lamb of god so this john
[24:39] but now remember
[24:40] you got to keep them separate just like
[24:42] in the end time we got to keep these son
[24:43] of man separate from a son of man okay
[24:46] brother brown was not the son of man he
[24:48] was a son of man revealing the son of
[24:51] man same way with me and you there was a
[24:52] man sent from god whose name was john
[24:54] the same came for a witness to bear
[24:57] witness of the light
[24:58] he wasn't the light he was bearing
[25:00] witness of the light that all men
[25:02] through him might be might believe he
[25:04] was not that light
[25:06] so there you keep them separate
[25:08] because john was not virgin born
[25:11] john might have been born of two good
[25:13] parents and he might have been
[25:14] prophesied that he was going to come
[25:16] but he was born in sin just like
[25:18] everybody else right
[25:20] he was not that light but was sent to
[25:22] bear witness of that light
[25:24] that was the true light which lighteth
[25:27] every man that cometh into the world
[25:29] he was in the world and the world was
[25:31] made by him and the world knew him not
[25:35] now see listen
[25:36] the world
[25:38] in the old testament they had an
[25:40] understanding of jehovah because they
[25:42] knew there was only one god
[25:44] so they had an understanding of this
[25:45] jehovah person
[25:47] being spirit
[25:49] something you can't see
[25:50] something this far off and way up under
[25:52] somewhere
[25:54] but now it's telling us here he was in
[25:56] the world
[25:57] so somehow he got down here
[25:59] amen and the world was made by him and
[26:02] the world knew him not
[26:04] he came unto his own and his own
[26:06] received him not
[26:08] but as many as received him to them gave
[26:10] he power to become the sons of god
[26:13] even to them that believe on his name
[26:15] which were born not of blood we were
[26:17] talking about last night on my new birth
[26:19] not the will of the flesh nor the will
[26:20] of man but of god
[26:22] and the word was made flesh
[26:25] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[26:27] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[26:29] of the father
[26:30] full of grace
[26:33] and truth and then now john you can be
[26:35] seated john met that guy on isle of
[26:37] patmos
[26:40] right he was standing in the midst of
[26:41] the gold one like unto the white son of
[26:43] man
[26:44] standing in the midst of the golden
[26:46] candlesticks like unto the son of man
[26:48] which was in bride form which was gerd
[26:51] about the paps and also the bible study
[26:53] next um month is going to be about what
[26:56] is the holy ghost
[26:58] and
[26:59] what is the new birth so we're going to
[27:01] put them together but they are separate
[27:04] because remember you can have the
[27:05] baptism of the holy ghost every day of
[27:06] your life and die and go to hell but you
[27:08] can't be born again and die and go to
[27:10] hell
[27:11] right
[27:12] amen
[27:14] so if you get the new birth it is the
[27:15] holy ghost but it's not exactly what
[27:17] that is so we're going to try to bring
[27:18] that out
[27:20] the next bible study so
[27:24] we love to talk about the word of god
[27:27] it's something that
[27:29] that the world i i was talking we were
[27:32] talking last night and you know we have
[27:34] we have a purpose we have a we have a
[27:36] motive of being we we have a
[27:38] where somewhere to go
[27:41] somewhere like like brother john said
[27:44] it's something we don't have to nail up
[27:45] anymore boards and we don't have to
[27:47] paint it and we don't have to keep it up
[27:49] it's never going to grow old
[27:51] amen that's our future home but see the
[27:53] people of the earth
[27:55] i was listening last yesterday after the
[27:58] georgia game yeah i do listen to georgia
[28:00] games sorry about them
[28:01] but anyway after the georgia game this
[28:03] commentator said i don't know what i'm
[28:04] going to do tomorrow that's sunday
[28:08] he said i'm just going to sit and and
[28:10] and in other words soak up and and and
[28:13] just take this great victory in and and
[28:16] i don't know what i'm going to do but
[28:17] that's what i'm going to do
[28:20] god wasn't mentioned nowhere obviously
[28:22] he wasn't going to church
[28:24] amen
[28:26] that's the purpose of people having life
[28:27] they have no purpose at all just a revel
[28:30] in the fact that they're team one x y z
[28:32] whatever
[28:34] well why can't we have the same thing
[28:36] when we come to church on sunday morning
[28:38] why can't we revel or or or why can't we
[28:41] say hey we've won
[28:44] we're a victor
[28:46] our team won
[28:47] you read it in the bible
[28:49] that we've already won it's not
[28:51] something we've got to wait till the
[28:52] fourth quarter the two minutes left in
[28:53] the game to find out who's going to win
[28:54] the game
[28:56] we won when we got up
[28:58] amen
[28:59] all devils in hell started shaking when
[29:01] we got out of the bed you need to start
[29:02] believing that
[29:04] that's what that's what that spirit
[29:06] realm is looking at there's devils in
[29:08] that spirit realm but there's also god
[29:10] in that spirit realm amen there's the
[29:12] angels of god that are helping you when
[29:14] you get up out of the bed put your feet
[29:15] on the ground and say thank you god for
[29:17] giving me one more day
[29:19] thank you god for giving me one more day
[29:21] see because the
[29:23] when we talk about this son of man when
[29:25] we get toward the end of it sure we're
[29:26] going to separate it but when we bring
[29:28] this thing together it's going to it's
[29:29] going to overlap into you
[29:33] we're going to talk about this great
[29:34] being and this great
[29:36] creator and this great person that we're
[29:38] going to talk about but when we get to
[29:40] the end of this thing it's going to all
[29:42] melt together and he's not going to be
[29:43] able to tell from him
[29:45] to you
[29:48] because the bride of jesus christ will
[29:49] be the son of man in the end time not
[29:51] one man but all together we will be
[29:55] that headstone amen that's what i
[29:57] believe
[29:58] but let's read here in genesis
[30:01] we know this is a c chapter
[30:03] and right here's where we're going to
[30:04] get we're going to read a couple of this
[30:06] and then i'm going to a couple of
[30:07] scriptures they're gonna back up now in
[30:08] genesis 3 15
[30:10] now here is the promise this is god
[30:14] standing
[30:15] on the earth
[30:17] with two of his children that have
[30:18] sinned
[30:19] and the beast everybody got that
[30:23] and god
[30:25] at this moment
[30:27] is going to divide
[30:31] what he was going to do
[30:33] versus what he's doing now
[30:36] because remember he wouldn't all be
[30:38] saved he would all be he wanted adam and
[30:40] eve to produce
[30:42] the body for him to live in
[30:45] that's what the prophet of god said he
[30:46] was supposed to produce the body that
[30:48] jesus was to live in
[30:51] but at this point in time her natural
[30:54] womb was polluted with
[30:56] two seeds
[30:58] natural
[30:59] and god couldn't do that because her
[31:01] mind had already been messed up we were
[31:04] not supposed to come by sex we were not
[31:06] supposed to come the way we did but we
[31:08] had to
[31:09] in order for this eternal redemption
[31:11] that we've been preaching on for for
[31:13] months to come into being
[31:16] something had to fall
[31:18] for us to be redeemed
[31:21] all right
[31:22] because it was all it was always
[31:24] wonderful before and everything was fine
[31:26] and god knew this was going to happen
[31:29] but still he allowed all this to happen
[31:31] he couldn't he couldn't say well i'll
[31:32] choose this one i'll choose that one no
[31:34] he he let it play out by free moral
[31:36] agency by predestination we know that by
[31:38] foreign knowledge
[31:39] he had to let it play out because he had
[31:41] to be savior healer redeemer because
[31:44] before this scripture right here he was
[31:46] he was he had those attributes but he
[31:49] had no way to display them that's right
[31:50] right
[31:51] everybody got that he had the attributes
[31:54] he didn't gain any attributes prophet
[31:56] god in the church age book he didn't
[31:58] gain attributes as he came down here he
[32:00] was always the savior always the healer
[32:04] always the redeemer even when he was
[32:06] standing in the garden and told adam and
[32:08] eve he said if you eat of that tree
[32:10] you'll live if you eat of that tree
[32:12] you'll die well now he knew they were
[32:15] going to eat that tree
[32:17] but he had to give them the choice yes
[32:21] so that they could make the choice just
[32:23] like you do make your choice
[32:25] but there's a point in time when god
[32:26] says okay that's enough
[32:28] you broke your promise
[32:30] and i'm gonna have to do something and
[32:32] that's what he did in the garden
[32:35] and he didn't wipe adam and eve off the
[32:37] face of the earth
[32:42] he just said you broke the covenant so
[32:44] therefore you're gonna have to die as we
[32:45] were talking about the millennium
[32:47] a thousand years of the day in a
[32:48] thousand uh days a thousand years so god
[32:51] says i will put enmity
[32:54] or division between in other words what
[32:56] i was going to do
[32:59] if you hadn't if you had to eat off this
[33:01] tree of life
[33:02] this is what you would have done i
[33:03] already told you you'd live forever you
[33:05] wouldn't have any problems there'd be no
[33:07] death adam you'd rule the world and eve
[33:10] would rule it with you
[33:12] but since you did this there has to be a
[33:15] consequence because i am also a judge
[33:19] we love the savior and the healer and
[33:20] the redeemer hell we love that those
[33:22] attributes because it helps us but
[33:24] sometimes we don't like we got to
[33:25] remember he's a righteous judge also
[33:28] amen so he has to he has to give
[33:30] judgment where judgment is due so
[33:32] judgment is due here and like i said
[33:34] before though he didn't destroy his
[33:36] creation
[33:39] he just said from now on you're going to
[33:40] do this
[33:42] you're going to die
[33:43] you're going to chop you're going to
[33:45] bear children just like you are right
[33:46] now you're going to keep burying them
[33:48] for
[33:49] until the rapture takes place and i will
[33:52] put enmity a division between thee and
[33:56] the woman thee who the serpent he's
[33:58] fixing to put him on his belly the
[34:00] serpent is going to be gone serpent's
[34:01] not going to have anything to do as far
[34:03] as being the upright beast or the
[34:06] missing link he's going to have nothing
[34:08] to do anymore
[34:09] god's going to wipe him off and make him
[34:11] a snake
[34:12] so i'm going to put enmity between thee
[34:14] and the woman and between thy seed so he
[34:17] had a seed natural and her seed remember
[34:20] a woman doesn't have a seed so she has
[34:22] to be given one and this is speaking as
[34:24] the prophet of god tells us this is a
[34:26] great one of the greatest scriptures of
[34:28] promise that tells you that god's going
[34:29] to come down in a natural seed
[34:34] now he's spirit
[34:37] he's spirit
[34:38] but when he comes down into human flesh
[34:41] god has to create an egg and a germ and
[34:44] put it in the womb of mary
[34:45] and there is her seed she's given a seed
[34:49] right
[34:49] because remember even he says i was
[34:51] given another seed which was seth which
[34:53] was the type of christ coming
[34:55] after abel had died it shall bruise thy
[34:57] head
[34:58] and thou shalt bruise his heel in other
[35:00] words he's going to have to go to
[35:02] calvary
[35:03] and you know bruising your heel doesn't
[35:05] kill you
[35:07] right
[35:08] but now bruising your head does
[35:10] so the promise is it it what her seed
[35:13] shall bruise your head satan but now
[35:16] your that person is gonna have to go
[35:18] through sorrow and trials and
[35:20] tribulation and be made perfect you say
[35:22] the son of man yeah the son of man i'm
[35:24] gonna read you
[35:25] on down the road where he had to grow in
[35:28] grace and knowledge he suffered he
[35:30] became perfect by the things he suffered
[35:32] because he was in a human body he was a
[35:35] human being
[35:37] hungry tired sleepy brother brown said
[35:40] he could have had children if he wanted
[35:41] to have children he was that much man
[35:46] but he couldn't because see that would
[35:47] break his purpose
[35:49] his purpose was to get a spiritual group
[35:51] of people not a natural group of people
[35:53] amen but he's going to have to work
[35:55] through natural group of people to get
[35:56] the spiritual people
[35:59] because see we're going to read in just
[36:00] a little while that genesis 1 26 man
[36:02] that's before here that's the spiritual
[36:04] man that's the part we've talked about
[36:06] it many times but we're going to have to
[36:08] bring it out because listen that's where
[36:10] god began to unfold itself
[36:16] but he couldn't anymore like he wanted
[36:18] to
[36:19] from this point forward
[36:22] from this point back
[36:24] there was a chance that it could be by
[36:26] spoken word
[36:27] but now after they had done what they
[36:29] did by the physical
[36:31] there's no way that could happen anymore
[36:32] so god said okay i'm going to divide
[36:34] this thing up i'm going to i'm going to
[36:36] have my plan
[36:39] and there's going to be a human plan
[36:42] if i got that say amen because god is a
[36:44] spirit and they that worship him must
[36:45] worship him what spirit and truth but
[36:48] i'm going to work because satan said if
[36:50] i can get them divided
[36:52] i can work on this group he can't work
[36:55] on that genesis 1 26 man he can't work
[36:57] on god
[36:59] no
[37:00] he can't work on god but when god put
[37:02] that inside of this flesh man satan said
[37:05] i can work on that right i can work on
[37:08] because there's a weakness there
[37:10] it's not original
[37:13] all right
[37:15] i'll put enmity between them the woman
[37:17] in between thy seed and her seed and it
[37:18] shall bruise my head and thou shalt
[37:20] bruise his heel
[37:22] now there's one more scripture that
[37:23] basically tells us
[37:26] that god is going to have to come into
[37:28] human flesh
[37:30] to deliver a group of people amen
[37:33] now what is that
[37:35] let's go to deuteronomy
[37:37] 18 15.
[37:39] this is moses moses said the lord thy
[37:42] god
[37:42] will raise up unto thee
[37:46] a prophet
[37:48] from the midst of thee of their brethren
[37:51] like unto me now what was moses a human
[37:53] being
[37:54] now moses was a human being right
[37:57] he was anointed by god but he was a
[37:59] human being so he said the lord thy god
[38:01] will raise up up unto thee a prophet
[38:05] you see that's a capital p
[38:08] because see the son of man is a prophet
[38:10] we're going to read probably later on
[38:12] next week or a couple weeks
[38:14] ezekiel
[38:16] that was like 40 sometimes god called
[38:18] said son of man son of man son of man
[38:21] what it was it was somebody in human
[38:22] flesh and there was a prophetic voice
[38:25] that was speaking out and that's the son
[38:27] of man not the son of man but a son of
[38:29] man talking but we'll get into that
[38:30] because sometimes there's a capital s
[38:32] and sometimes there's a lower case s
[38:34] sometimes it's talking about ezekiel
[38:36] sometimes it's not talking about
[38:36] ezekiel's talk about what god's going to
[38:38] do
[38:39] through ezekiel
[38:41] because he he decided
[38:44] once that enmity came he if he would
[38:46] have decided to do something different
[38:48] he would have went ahead and just
[38:49] destroyed adam
[38:50] and destroyed eve and started over but
[38:53] no he used that whole process with adam
[38:56] being fallen now in flesh
[38:58] eve being fallen in flesh he's going to
[39:00] use that now
[39:02] as an example to bring us back because
[39:05] the first adam failed so the second adam
[39:07] is not going to fail
[39:09] the seed of the woman can't fail
[39:11] because the promise has already been
[39:12] made
[39:13] all right so moses said the lord thy god
[39:16] will raise up literally a prophet
[39:18] from the midst of thee of thy brethren
[39:22] boaz
[39:23] being a perfect type of that
[39:26] from thy brethren like unto me what was
[39:29] moses the prophet
[39:31] he was a human being but he was a
[39:33] prophet right
[39:34] like unto me unto him
[39:37] ye shall harken
[39:39] everybody got that
[39:40] all right so now let's go to matthew
[39:43] we read this many times before in the
[39:47] when we were
[39:48] on the eternal redemption but we got to
[39:49] cover this because see you're going to
[39:51] have to separate it because you can't
[39:53] see the son of man in the old testament
[39:56] without seeing the son of god first
[39:59] now i'll we'll get we'll get to that
[40:01] okay
[40:02] because remember the the son of man
[40:05] jesus christ didn't show up until 2000
[40:07] years ago in the physical form on this
[40:09] earth in this dimension everybody got
[40:11] that
[40:12] why are y'all sleeping already drink
[40:14] some coffee
[40:16] i ain't had coffee in two or three weeks
[40:18] because of my acid reflux i'll go to
[40:20] sleep
[40:22] drink some coffee don't drink no energy
[40:24] drinks though
[40:27] and i told y'all about that somebody
[40:29] sent me a message on email the other day
[40:30] and said i'll quit drinking my energy
[40:32] drinks i'm sorry
[40:34] so anyway
[40:38] when jesus came to the coast of caesarea
[40:40] philippi he asked his disciples saying
[40:42] whom do men
[40:45] now
[40:46] let's set the stage here
[40:48] jesus has been on earth for about 30
[40:50] something years at this time
[40:52] that's pretty long time
[40:54] how many of y'all are how many of y'all
[40:55] are 32 to 33 years old pretty close to
[40:57] boyd you're twice that
[40:59] plus
[41:01] so but janet may be close to that to
[41:03] that page but
[41:06] so who's nobody close to 30 years old
[41:08] i thought gaby you're
[41:10] close
[41:12] over 30.
[41:13] yeah okay okay you didn't have to tell
[41:15] everybody but since you did she's 32.
[41:19] but now but look now her but she's been
[41:21] on her 32 years
[41:24] somebody including her
[41:27] paternal parents or whoever the parent
[41:29] somebody
[41:30] probably should know who she is by now
[41:33] right
[41:34] they should know her they know she's
[41:36] married she's got four kids but they
[41:38] should know all the other little things
[41:39] and even ryan's been around her for for
[41:41] you know nine or ten years how long have
[41:43] you been man
[41:46] it's not a trick question
[41:50] he was gone
[41:52] 14 years then you know a lot about her
[41:55] cause the intimacy and you're there with
[41:57] her and you know her little quirks and
[41:58] all those things like that so what am i
[42:00] saying this man has been with them
[42:03] now he's only been with them for several
[42:04] years because he called them right
[42:07] he didn't call his disciples when he was
[42:08] 20. but this man has been developing
[42:11] himself on the earth he's the son of man
[42:14] now that's jesus when you see jesus
[42:17] that's the son of man so the son of man
[42:20] is talking
[42:23] all right whom do men
[42:25] say that i the son of man i am in other
[42:27] words what do i like what's going on am
[42:29] i this am i that
[42:31] because they're going to say and they
[42:33] said who's they the disciples that's
[42:34] been around him for a few years by now
[42:37] so oh some say you're john the baptist
[42:42] some say you're elijah
[42:45] because they knew elijah had to come
[42:46] before the but they didn't know who he
[42:48] was right
[42:50] really
[42:51] uh jeremiah
[42:53] or one of the prophets
[42:55] he saith unto them the people has been
[42:56] around him the most
[42:59] you see how the son of man listen
[43:02] let me throw a little point in right
[43:04] here a little bullet point
[43:06] and don't get me wrong but the son of
[43:07] god is a lot more easier to understand
[43:09] than the son of man
[43:13] son of god spirit god that's the holy
[43:15] ghost it works inside of you it ought to
[43:16] be worth it but when you talk about the
[43:18] son of man you got to have that in human
[43:20] flesh in its
[43:21] stature of a perfect man
[43:24] or
[43:24] adoption stages so that's a little bit
[43:27] hard to understand more than the son of
[43:28] god so he's on the earth as the son of
[43:31] man
[43:32] they think he's something else
[43:35] and even peter is going to say thou art
[43:38] this
[43:40] the son of god
[43:42] he didn't tell him who the son of man
[43:43] was
[43:44] he told him who the son of god was
[43:47] all right
[43:48] and he says unto them but whom say ye
[43:50] that i am in other words i'm not worried
[43:51] about them now you've been around me for
[43:53] a year or so who do you think i am
[43:56] simon peter said thou art the christ
[43:59] now the christ is the creator
[44:02] okay everybody got that the christ is
[44:04] the one that created
[44:06] the son of the living god
[44:09] in other words god made manifest in a
[44:11] son
[44:12] because i don't believe peter even
[44:14] before his conversion i don't because
[44:17] brother brown said the jews never
[44:18] believed in but one god
[44:22] that's why
[44:23] peter and them had a problem sometimes
[44:25] with that but the pharisees had a real
[44:28] bad problem with it because they were
[44:29] religious
[44:31] and they knew if he said if you call me
[44:33] the son of god
[44:34] or here i am the son of man they knew
[44:38] because of their spirituality
[44:40] even though it'd be wrong
[44:42] because they had their own thought but
[44:44] they knew that had to be god
[44:46] they knew
[44:48] if the messiah was to come he'd be god
[44:50] in human flesh and he would be on earth
[44:54] but they didn't like the way he came
[44:56] because he came different
[44:58] than their normal
[45:01] they wanted him to be this yes he came
[45:03] as this
[45:04] all right has everybody got that
[45:06] simon peter answered the dollar to
[45:08] christ the son of the living god and
[45:09] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[45:11] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[45:13] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[45:16] my father which is in heaven in other
[45:17] words he got a revelation
[45:20] from god
[45:21] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[45:23] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[45:25] so what's he going to build his church
[45:26] on the revelation of the son of god thou
[45:29] art the christ the creator god you are
[45:32] the holy ghost you are the one that that
[45:34] brooded over the earth you're the one
[45:36] that told adam what to do you're the one
[45:38] that went over and and and you know did
[45:40] all these things down through the old
[45:42] testament but they couldn't see that
[45:43] that flesh
[45:45] there was something that they couldn't
[45:47] understand
[45:49] listen folks the son of man is a mystery
[45:52] that is the greatest mystery in the
[45:54] bible is to find out who that guy is
[45:57] amen and know who he is in his fullness
[45:59] not just know that he's well that's
[46:01] jesus back younger
[46:03] that's jesus back younger he walked 2
[46:05] thousand years ago that's yeah he was a
[46:07] creator god somehow
[46:09] see that somehow he got back there and
[46:12] created the world and somehow now he's
[46:14] in human flesh
[46:15] no
[46:16] no there's a process and we're going to
[46:17] go through that process all the way down
[46:19] right
[46:21] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[46:24] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[46:26] against it and i will give unto thee the
[46:28] keys of the kingdom of heaven
[46:30] whatsoever thou bind on earth
[46:32] shall be bind in heaven and whatsoever
[46:34] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[46:36] loosed in heaven in other words what did
[46:40] what was jesus telling him
[46:43] you've got a foundation
[46:46] of me the son of god uh okay right here
[46:49] and i'm gonna be on my church on that
[46:52] and the gates of hell's not gonna
[46:53] prevail against it
[46:54] but it's going to take 2 000 years
[46:58] come on it's going to take 2 000 years
[47:01] though for you to understand this guy
[47:05] i'm going to build my church and
[47:07] establish my church on the spirit of god
[47:10] entering in on the day of pentecost and
[47:12] coming in a spirit form and entering
[47:15] into those people on the day of
[47:16] pentecost
[47:17] and making them sons and daughters of
[47:19] god
[47:21] but not in the fullness
[47:23] the fullness has got to be in the end
[47:24] time
[47:26] everybody got that
[47:27] amen
[47:29] y'all sure made a lot more noise when
[47:30] brother andrew was here last sunday
[47:32] i can't kick around and jump like he
[47:34] does i'm sorry
[47:37] i couldn't even try we'd be praying for
[47:39] the sick
[47:40] me
[47:42] louis you didn't have to amend that
[47:46] but i'm going to give you the keys of
[47:47] the kingdom of what
[47:49] the revelation
[47:50] of the son of god
[47:52] the foundation
[47:54] okay you've got this part
[47:57] but it's going to take you 2 000 years
[48:00] peter you got to go through these stages
[48:02] i got to come and go inside of you and
[48:04] you've got to stand up on the day of
[48:05] pentecost and say this is that
[48:09] but remember this is that spoken by joel
[48:11] that i'll pour out my spirit on all
[48:13] flesh
[48:15] that's why you can have the holy ghost
[48:18] anoint your spirit
[48:19] and die and go to hell and not be a
[48:21] born-again believer
[48:22] because he said i'll pour up my spirit
[48:24] on all flesh
[48:25] but i see that what in the son of man
[48:28] that was the son of god in human beings
[48:30] but he poured it out everywhere
[48:33] listen only a small group of people
[48:36] no one when the son of man was on the
[48:38] earth the first time no one knew who he
[48:41] was
[48:44] they were
[48:45] they were in line
[48:47] they were getting there
[48:50] i'm going to build my church on this
[48:51] revelation
[48:53] that you were lost yes
[48:56] you came the way you should not have
[48:58] come
[49:00] but i'm not going to leave you this way
[49:02] i'm going to send you a comforter
[49:05] remember that's what jesus already told
[49:06] me i'm going to send you a comforter and
[49:08] that comforter is going to come and he's
[49:11] going to take you and rearrange that
[49:13] problem that your
[49:15] adulterous adam and eve had in the
[49:18] beginning
[49:19] but i had to come
[49:21] i the son of man had to come
[49:24] to be the lamb of god to take away the
[49:26] sin of the world
[49:27] i couldn't just you know listen why
[49:30] have you ever thought like this why
[49:31] didn't god just send the holy ghost
[49:34] why didn't he just send down the spirit
[49:36] and just go inside of you and and make
[49:39] you a son and daughter of god and jesus
[49:41] wouldn't have died
[49:44] because of that genesis 3 15. that's
[49:46] right
[49:46] there's a division between god and man
[49:50] just like abraham and or um
[49:53] sorry lazarus and the rich young ruler
[49:55] there's a great gulf fix there's a chasm
[49:58] there
[49:58] that adam and eve dropped down to that
[50:01] god couldn't just say oh that's okay
[50:04] no they broke the promise of god
[50:07] they broke his word
[50:09] from the beginning even being a son and
[50:12] daughter of god
[50:13] the bible says adam was the son of god
[50:16] and boy i went back into blasphemous
[50:18] names and
[50:19] and read that when bob was talking about
[50:21] it wednesday night
[50:22] i went back and read it i got a lot more
[50:24] out of than i read the previous 14 or 15
[50:26] times
[50:27] you ever done that
[50:29] okay
[50:30] it's like they add pages in there and
[50:31] you and you'd say that wasn't in there
[50:33] before
[50:38] but see
[50:39] adam was a human being
[50:41] let's go right back to the daddy of all
[50:42] this adam was a human being
[50:44] right right
[50:46] he was the first physical
[50:48] human being
[50:50] now remember we're going to go back to
[50:51] genesis 1 26 don't worry because that
[50:53] was spirit man before he was put in the
[50:55] flesh but in genesis 2 7 there started
[50:57] the human race
[50:59] or the human people
[51:01] everybody got that
[51:04] amen and he was the son of god he had
[51:06] complete control
[51:09] and he did pretty much what he wanted to
[51:11] do
[51:13] because it's like brother brown said
[51:16] here adam you take care of the earth i'm
[51:18] going to go take care of the heavens
[51:21] i'm going to leave you alone
[51:23] you leave me alone i'm going to come
[51:24] down and talk to you in the cool today
[51:26] but when you call that thing an elephant
[51:27] an elephant that's what it's going to be
[51:29] i don't have to come down and judge that
[51:32] because you have my mind you have part
[51:34] of that genesis 1 26 man so whatever you
[51:37] say that's what it's going to be
[51:40] god didn't have a problem with that
[51:41] folks
[51:43] why should he have a problem now for
[51:45] that to happen
[51:47] he said well we don't need to be naming
[51:48] animals no but we can call things ask
[51:51] for things speak for things we got to
[51:54] come to adoption we're not going to ever
[51:56] speak people out of the grave until we
[51:58] can be able to speak
[51:59] and have things that we need amen i'm
[52:01] not talking about i'm not talking about
[52:04] physical things like temporal things but
[52:06] i am talking about healing
[52:08] salvation for you children amen sister
[52:11] hattie wright proved that she was just a
[52:13] little washed woman that was poor lady
[52:15] and she said i want the salvation of my
[52:17] two sons
[52:18] and god said you can have it amen
[52:21] now that was that was that was a son of
[52:24] man speaking
[52:25] but he was speaking under the authority
[52:28] because we're going to read in the bible
[52:30] because a lady comes to brother branham
[52:32] after the marriage in divorce and he
[52:33] says she says you forgive those people
[52:36] their sins
[52:38] he said is that too far off
[52:41] because we're going to read in the
[52:42] scripture in a few weeks in the book
[52:45] of luke i believe or matthew
[52:47] it says the son of man
[52:49] can forgive sins on the earth
[52:52] that's right remember he told that he
[52:54] told that guy that was laying there with
[52:56] a palsy he didn't say rise up and walk
[52:58] he said he said rise up your sins have
[53:01] been forgiven go home
[53:03] and then the pharisees says what do you
[53:05] mean
[53:06] what do you mean he forgive those sins
[53:08] he said okay is it better for me to say
[53:11] you're healed rise up and walk and go
[53:13] home
[53:14] so he was telling him he said what's the
[53:16] difference
[53:18] but he said you know he said i want you
[53:19] to know that the son of man has power to
[53:22] forgive sins on the earth amen
[53:25] that's why we had to have a glimpse of
[53:27] the son of man back here for marriage
[53:29] and divorce and all the different things
[53:30] that we needed when the prophet was
[53:32] standing here he was giving us grace it
[53:34] wasn't a prophet giving it to us it was
[53:36] god giving it to us
[53:37] but he was giving it to us in the form
[53:39] of him in human flesh i said a form
[53:42] because brother brown was not the son of
[53:44] man
[53:45] it was the son of man using a son of man
[53:48] to do what he was going to do
[53:51] in the scripture we'll talk about in a
[53:52] minute
[53:55] so let's read number one who is god
[54:01] all right
[54:02] so he first was god
[54:05] jehovah
[54:08] now what is jehovah god above us
[54:12] or or the existing one all right
[54:15] let's just picture now as a little drama
[54:17] so you can get it let's
[54:18] see coming out of space where there's
[54:20] nothing
[54:21] let's make it a little white light like
[54:22] a mystic light now remember we just read
[54:25] john 1 he's the creator
[54:28] and that creator was made flesh
[54:30] everybody got that
[54:32] we can't lose that string that we just
[54:34] we made a string now we got that string
[54:36] here
[54:37] can't break the string that's god
[54:39] that's all his attributes
[54:41] all right so it's not another person
[54:45] okay
[54:45] it's what
[54:47] it's an actor playing different parts
[54:50] all right we've been through this but i
[54:51] want to get this to where we can see
[54:53] because we got to come from seeing it's
[54:55] like i said before it's it's a little
[54:57] more easy to see the son of god than it
[54:58] is to see the son of man no i mean the
[55:00] son of man not a son of a man the son of
[55:02] man all right because brother brown said
[55:04] he's got to become visible among us
[55:09] not out there in us
[55:11] raise the dead and we're going to
[55:12] rapture
[55:14] because it's easy to see this
[55:16] it's easy to see that jesus died for my
[55:18] sins you see and it you say no it's hard
[55:21] well it is hard but it's easier once you
[55:23] see it to say okay that's the holy ghost
[55:25] and it come inside of me but can you see
[55:27] that that is developing the son of man
[55:30] just like it was two thousand years ago
[55:33] because that's the character that's why
[55:34] the statue of perfect man is so
[55:36] important
[55:37] it is the characteristics of the son of
[55:40] man
[55:41] amen
[55:44] listen we know god had patience and
[55:46] temperance and we're going to read here
[55:47] in just a minute where god said i've had
[55:49] enough of this i'm going to wipe it off
[55:51] that's what he said i've had enough of
[55:53] this i'm wiping this place off
[55:59] but when he came on earth
[56:02] he forgave those people
[56:05] through human eyes
[56:08] he gave them grace
[56:10] all right
[56:11] so let's now picture a little drama so
[56:13] you can get it
[56:14] let's see coming out of space where
[56:16] there's nothing
[56:17] let's make it a little white light like
[56:19] a mystic light now listen folks as we
[56:21] said before this is a drama
[56:24] god never was a blob of light
[56:30] if not i mean if he was then you and i
[56:33] have to be little blobs of light because
[56:34] we were made in his image we're going to
[56:36] see that in just a few minutes okay
[56:38] everybody got that
[56:39] what happens is listen it's a revelation
[56:42] because when moses walked up to the
[56:44] burning bush
[56:47] he wasn't talking to a burning bush
[56:51] burning bushes don't talk
[56:54] there was a god behind that
[56:59] that was a human man standing there but
[57:02] moses revelation wouldn't let him see
[57:04] that because moses revelation later
[57:09] same guy
[57:11] same guy you've been talking to for the
[57:12] whole time
[57:13] he said he said oh god i'd like to see
[57:15] you he said okay go stand in the cliff
[57:17] with rock well what walk by brother
[57:19] brown said jesus christ walked by before
[57:21] he was jesus that was the theophany of
[57:23] god walked by and what the bible said
[57:25] was it was a man
[57:28] so moses's revelation was
[57:31] that's a burning bush but don't don't
[57:32] tell me
[57:34] that moses went to pharaoh and pharaoh
[57:36] says well how are you going to take
[57:37] these people out well there was this
[57:38] bush
[57:43] he'd been smoking something pharaoh said
[57:46] there was this bush
[57:47] and it talked to me
[57:50] no he stood there and he said the god of
[57:52] abraham isaac and jacob
[57:56] sent me here
[57:57] to take over
[57:59] amen
[58:00] that's what his revelation was
[58:02] is that he wasn't talking to this this
[58:04] bush
[58:06] he was talking to god in the bush
[58:09] that's the same god that stood on the
[58:11] shores of galilee
[58:13] before abraham was i am
[58:16] all right so look now let's make it a
[58:17] little white light so once you see the
[58:19] white light what we're doing is we're
[58:20] projecting brother branham is making a
[58:23] projection that here comes this light
[58:25] because remember you can't see god at
[58:27] any time
[58:28] so he's got to be manifested in
[58:30] something yes
[58:32] so why not
[58:33] why not a light because remember that's
[58:35] that same light that stood over brother
[58:36] branham at the houston coliseum in 1950.
[58:41] amen and the same one that some of us
[58:43] have seen before in different things
[58:44] it's the same thing but it's jesus
[58:46] christ it's not of life it's not just
[58:48] this light
[58:49] it's god in that light
[58:52] like a mystic light like a halo
[58:55] now what'd that look like on brother
[58:56] brown's head
[58:57] like a halo
[58:59] right
[59:00] and that was the logos that went out of
[59:03] god in the beginning now
[59:05] now look that was the son of god
[59:09] remember brother dale asked a question
[59:11] 40 years ago
[59:13] put it up on the wall right here a lot
[59:15] of us weren't here and some of us
[59:16] weren't even born
[59:18] but he asked he said what do you think
[59:21] of
[59:22] when i say the son of god
[59:26] and most people
[59:28] said two thousand years ago
[59:31] no that's the son of man
[59:35] the creator god
[59:36] is the son of god that was before the
[59:38] foundation of the world
[59:41] amen look that was the son of god that
[59:43] came out of the bosom of the father now
[59:45] look it wasn't like
[59:47] god was standing here and all of a
[59:48] sudden
[59:49] what are those things that stick on the
[59:51] trees that kakedas
[59:53] you've seen them sticking on a tree and
[59:54] it looks like it's just a shell because
[59:56] they came out of it
[59:58] it's not like that
[59:59] god just moved over in another form so
[1:00:01] he could talk
[1:00:03] and we could understand him
[1:00:05] see look this is all for us it's not for
[1:00:07] god that's right
[1:00:08] this whole bible is not for god to show
[1:00:11] god that he's
[1:00:12] god the bible is there and the prophet's
[1:00:15] message is there to show where god is
[1:00:18] and who he is
[1:00:20] and what he's doing
[1:00:23] i thought we were supposed to see that
[1:00:24] which was which is and is to come
[1:00:27] that's god
[1:00:29] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:30] and forever
[1:00:32] and that was the logos that went out of
[1:00:33] god in the beginning in other words he
[1:00:35] stepped down condescended to man
[1:00:38] condescending toward man or towards
[1:00:40] something
[1:00:41] so that we could understand that now
[1:00:43] that
[1:00:45] being is going to start creating he's
[1:00:47] going to start saying something
[1:00:49] and when he's what he says
[1:00:52] comes to pass
[1:00:54] that's the revelation or that's the
[1:00:56] manifestation of who he is
[1:00:58] remember brother brown said he believed
[1:00:59] his own word
[1:01:01] amen you know you got to start believing
[1:01:03] that too
[1:01:05] not frivolous stuff you got to start
[1:01:07] believing your own word
[1:01:11] but you got to have power with character
[1:01:14] not power without character because
[1:01:16] remember that's satanic
[1:01:18] you don't use it listen you wouldn't use
[1:01:20] it to harm anybody
[1:01:22] you shouldn't use it to harm anybody
[1:01:24] right
[1:01:25] that was the son of god that came out of
[1:01:27] the bosom of the father
[1:01:28] that was what was in the beginning was
[1:01:30] the word
[1:01:32] and the word was with god
[1:01:34] and the word was god
[1:01:36] remember the bible was written before
[1:01:38] the foundation of the word world that's
[1:01:40] the word that's right
[1:01:43] the word's not just god saying things
[1:01:45] over and over again and this and that no
[1:01:47] it's got a purpose
[1:01:48] the only way we can understand him is by
[1:01:50] the bible how the bible give it to us is
[1:01:53] the only way we can understand god
[1:01:55] but then it took a prophet to give us
[1:01:57] the love letter part
[1:01:59] the in between the
[1:02:02] lines
[1:02:03] but see a lot of people tried to
[1:02:04] interpret between the lines
[1:02:07] and it didn't coincide with the top and
[1:02:09] it didn't coincide with the wa you know
[1:02:10] brother brian said whatever's in between
[1:02:12] the line has got to coincide with what
[1:02:14] the top is and what the bottom is in
[1:02:16] other words what is in between
[1:02:18] all right it can't be blue red blue it's
[1:02:21] got to be
[1:02:22] blue blue blue
[1:02:25] this has got to coincide whatever you
[1:02:26] stick in there
[1:02:28] has got to be the same thing as those
[1:02:30] two but it gives you a deeper meaning
[1:02:34] instead of just saying well the bible no
[1:02:36] it was god it was a human it was a
[1:02:38] person the word was god the word was
[1:02:39] what made flesh
[1:02:41] come down here and dwelt among us in the
[1:02:43] beginning was god
[1:02:45] and then look out of god came the logos
[1:02:48] a part of god that went out of god or
[1:02:51] the speech of god
[1:02:52] are something we can understand him more
[1:02:55] by
[1:02:56] as being the creator
[1:02:58] all right so now let's read number two
[1:03:03] am i all right
[1:03:05] we got to get to something here i didn't
[1:03:06] think i thought i'd be way short
[1:03:09] now if god created man in his own image
[1:03:11] now okay
[1:03:14] come over here with me open your eyes so
[1:03:16] you can see what i'm talking about
[1:03:19] okay
[1:03:20] so now if you got a halo of light
[1:03:24] if we're going to be if he's going to
[1:03:25] create something in his image whatever
[1:03:27] he creates he's got to be a halo of
[1:03:29] light if he was just a halo of light
[1:03:33] everybody got that
[1:03:35] now god created a man in his own image
[1:03:37] no what is an image when you look inside
[1:03:39] a mirror do you see her no i'm sorry
[1:03:42] y'all are twins do you see her when you
[1:03:44] look inside of a mirror who do you say
[1:03:46] oh
[1:03:49] why because that's your image
[1:03:51] we were created in the image of god
[1:03:54] the genesis 1 26
[1:03:56] man and if god created man in his own
[1:04:00] image and in his own likeness look what
[1:04:02] kind of man was he
[1:04:05] a spirit man
[1:04:07] not flesh yet
[1:04:09] okay remember genesis 2 7 is the flesh
[1:04:11] genesis 1 26 is not flesh i mean it's
[1:04:13] not flesh yet
[1:04:15] right
[1:04:16] anybody got that
[1:04:18] we've been through this 100 times
[1:04:23] that doesn't mean you can sleep through
[1:04:24] it
[1:04:26] now if you'll notice
[1:04:30] i'll tell you something later
[1:04:33] now if you'll notice after he had made
[1:04:35] all the creation look
[1:04:40] and i want to kind of give you a little
[1:04:41] something here this is not going to cost
[1:04:42] you any money i was talking to a
[1:04:43] preacher friend of mine
[1:04:45] and he thought that that genesis 1
[1:04:48] from genesis 1
[1:04:51] to the creation of man
[1:04:53] was a spiritual creation
[1:04:58] and then when god put
[1:05:02] the 126 man into the 2 7 man
[1:05:05] then boom everything become flesh i
[1:05:08] don't see that
[1:05:11] he made a physical creation
[1:05:15] them pigs and dogs and horses when he
[1:05:17] created them they were in flesh
[1:05:19] because they were already procreating
[1:05:21] before god even put the two seven man on
[1:05:23] earth if not then the lamb that he
[1:05:25] killed and thrown into the bushes for
[1:05:27] adam and eve he'd have killed either the
[1:05:29] the man or the girl
[1:05:31] and there'd be no more lambs
[1:05:33] they had to be procreating
[1:05:36] anyway but that and brother brown even
[1:05:38] tells you it's a finished physical
[1:05:40] creation when god finished the physical
[1:05:42] creation then he put the 270 or the 126
[1:05:45] man into the 2-7 man so that he could
[1:05:47] lead the earth i mean he was leading the
[1:05:49] earth but he could lead it by being on
[1:05:51] the earth now look
[1:05:53] but he had made all the creation and
[1:05:55] created a spirit man the close reading
[1:05:57] of this now to the one that asked the
[1:05:58] question we'll find this that god gave
[1:06:00] dominion of the cattle and the fish and
[1:06:02] everything to the man i told that
[1:06:04] brother i said how can a how can a fish
[1:06:06] be a spiritual fish and it be swimming
[1:06:13] ain't it happening
[1:06:15] and how can god tell them to eat grass
[1:06:19] be a spiritual
[1:06:20] something spiritual
[1:06:22] i just don't see that
[1:06:24] so anyway he called me back a few days
[1:06:26] later and he said i can see now what
[1:06:27] you're talking about so maybe it helped
[1:06:29] him a little bit
[1:06:30] but in his making up there he made man
[1:06:33] in his own image to lead the cattle now
[1:06:35] what does he mean by up there genesis 1
[1:06:36] 26
[1:06:38] all right
[1:06:39] he made man in his own image to lead the
[1:06:41] cattle lead the beast of the field just
[1:06:43] like the holy spirit leads the believer
[1:06:44] today
[1:06:45] he was in other words adam the first man
[1:06:48] in the lower creations of god
[1:06:50] the first creation was god himself now
[1:06:52] brother dale's been through this we've
[1:06:54] been through this
[1:06:55] god didn't create itself as you think he
[1:06:57] just said that the creation was is that
[1:06:59] we can understand him a little bit more
[1:07:02] he moved over into another form so we
[1:07:04] can understand him better okay all right
[1:07:07] first creation was god himself because
[1:07:09] seething out of the out of god came to
[1:07:12] logos
[1:07:14] which was the son of god which i just
[1:07:15] told you was the one that created the
[1:07:17] world
[1:07:17] everybody got that
[1:07:19] started speaking
[1:07:20] he spoke to genesis 1 26 man
[1:07:25] the first creation was god himself now
[1:07:27] of god came to logos which was the son
[1:07:29] of god
[1:07:31] 2 000 years ago no
[1:07:34] 6 000 years ago or even further than
[1:07:36] that
[1:07:37] it's when the son of god came into being
[1:07:41] then out of god came the logos which was
[1:07:43] the son of god
[1:07:46] which was the word
[1:07:48] in the beginning was the word where it
[1:07:49] was with god and the word was god and
[1:07:51] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:07:52] us look out of the logos came forth the
[1:07:56] man
[1:07:58] what man the genesis 1 26 man
[1:08:00] because the logo spoke and said
[1:08:03] let us make man in our own image
[1:08:06] all right have i got that so now let's
[1:08:07] read genesis 1 26
[1:08:11] which should be the next one
[1:08:13] god said okay let us make man in our own
[1:08:15] image after our likeness let them have
[1:08:18] dominion
[1:08:19] them plural dominion over the fish of
[1:08:21] the sea and over the fowl of the air i
[1:08:24] can't see a a spiritual bird flying
[1:08:26] somewhere this has to be a natural
[1:08:28] creation okay
[1:08:29] and over the cattle and over all the
[1:08:31] earth and over every creeping land that
[1:08:32] creepeth upon the earth so god created
[1:08:34] man in his own image
[1:08:37] so god must have looked
[1:08:39] right adam must look in the form just
[1:08:41] like god
[1:08:42] i said in the form just like god
[1:08:45] now what did he tell him now watch
[1:08:47] so god created man his own image
[1:08:50] and the image of god created in him male
[1:08:52] and female created he them
[1:08:55] he's setting up something here
[1:08:57] right and god blessed them
[1:09:04] do you know his children are already
[1:09:05] blessed before they even come
[1:09:08] before they even come to the earth
[1:09:10] see now that's predestination i'll go
[1:09:12] with you there that's the eternal part
[1:09:13] eternal security if you're in that part
[1:09:16] you always watch
[1:09:19] because that is eternal god
[1:09:21] that is him forming his children by the
[1:09:23] word of god
[1:09:25] born by the breath of god the prophet
[1:09:27] tells us in blasphemies names
[1:09:29] children god born by the breath of god
[1:09:32] that's why i could see
[1:09:34] where adam was a human being formed in
[1:09:37] genesis 2 7 and then god put eternal
[1:09:39] life in adam
[1:09:42] what he said in blasphemy's name brother
[1:09:43] dale's been preaching for years
[1:09:47] look adam just didn't get formed and god
[1:09:48] breathed eternal life into him no he was
[1:09:50] a human being first
[1:09:53] then especially into adam he breathed
[1:09:56] the breath of eternal life and sent
[1:09:57] blasphemous names that's a direct quote
[1:10:00] all right have everybody got that amen
[1:10:03] and god blessed them and god said unto
[1:10:05] them be fruitful and multiply
[1:10:08] multiply
[1:10:11] now wait a minute
[1:10:13] we're not supposed to be doing any
[1:10:14] hanky-panky
[1:10:17] right everybody knows how we get here
[1:10:18] now
[1:10:19] pretty much except for the real young
[1:10:21] ones
[1:10:22] you know how you got here
[1:10:24] that's not how you're supposed to got
[1:10:26] here
[1:10:28] but you're supposed to be fruitful and
[1:10:30] multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:10:31] subdue it and have dominion over the
[1:10:33] fish of the sea and found the air and
[1:10:34] over every living thing that moves upon
[1:10:36] the earth that's what god wanted he
[1:10:38] wanted people born by the word of god
[1:10:41] the spoken word of god from the
[1:10:43] beginning through here
[1:10:47] no sex involved
[1:10:49] that's why you got to see the serpent
[1:10:50] seed that how that's how it fell down to
[1:10:53] but god still said
[1:10:55] satan
[1:10:56] i'm way ahead of you buddy remember i
[1:10:58] created you i hope he says that one
[1:11:00] every once while i hope he loves the
[1:11:01] devil said remember i created you
[1:11:05] i hope he does
[1:11:07] i credited you buddy
[1:11:09] cause satan was standing here watching
[1:11:10] this the same thing
[1:11:12] lucifer was right here be fruitful and
[1:11:15] multiply and replenish the earth because
[1:11:16] see that's what he told eve he said eve
[1:11:18] god told you to multiply
[1:11:21] god told you to replenish the earth look
[1:11:23] at all these animals how they're
[1:11:24] creating procreating
[1:11:28] because the beast was procreating also
[1:11:32] he had a mrs beast
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:37] so god said be fruit but now look it's
[1:11:39] what god said now what satan said
[1:11:42] god said be fruitful multiply and
[1:11:43] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[1:11:45] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:11:46] and foul the air so that genesis 1 26
[1:11:48] man before it was ever put in flesh was
[1:11:50] supposed to procreate
[1:11:54] the children of god were supposed to
[1:11:55] develop
[1:11:57] let's just put it this way in the garden
[1:11:58] of eden under perfect condition
[1:12:00] god set this in motion
[1:12:02] adam and eve by the spoken word of god
[1:12:04] was supposed to bring all these children
[1:12:06] one right after the other
[1:12:08] ever how you want to say it i don't care
[1:12:11] but it's a spiritual birth not a natural
[1:12:13] birth
[1:12:14] natural birth is what's killing us
[1:12:18] why did jesus say you must be born again
[1:12:20] we'll talk about last night what's the
[1:12:21] first thing nicodemus said
[1:12:24] the great teacher that actually read
[1:12:26] this
[1:12:27] out of genesis 1. they had the old
[1:12:30] testament nicodemus was a teacher
[1:12:33] amen
[1:12:34] he said a master teacher you are
[1:12:36] nicodemus and you and nicodemus said
[1:12:39] have i got to go back and get in my
[1:12:41] natural mother's womb and be born jesus
[1:12:43] said no that's what's killing you now
[1:12:45] son
[1:12:46] you got to be born from above
[1:12:48] but he never understood it okay
[1:12:52] so now
[1:12:53] let's go to the next we only got just a
[1:12:54] minute here let's go to
[1:12:57] brother brown says let's close our eyes
[1:12:59] to our imagination for a few moments
[1:13:03] go way back before there was anything
[1:13:06] the great fountain of all eternity was
[1:13:08] that spirit of love joy that spirit of
[1:13:10] honesty
[1:13:11] that spirit of trueness in this
[1:13:12] perfection and then out of the existence
[1:13:15] of the father went to logos which was
[1:13:16] the sun which was the theophany
[1:13:19] which was the body of great jehovah in
[1:13:21] other words somebody we could see
[1:13:24] somebody we could see
[1:13:26] all right even brother branham said if
[1:13:28] you if you're looking at it it's like a
[1:13:29] father with a child playing at the door
[1:13:31] well he could see something it was an
[1:13:32] image
[1:13:33] right
[1:13:34] but it's not two people it's just god
[1:13:36] stepping forward closer to us so that we
[1:13:39] can understand him right right
[1:13:42] because how can you understand somebody
[1:13:43] that never had a beginning
[1:13:46] we'll never have an end
[1:13:49] you can't
[1:13:50] but if you can say
[1:13:52] through the bible and through the
[1:13:53] prophet's message that god was there by
[1:13:55] itself and then this halo of light went
[1:13:58] out or this revelation goes out and
[1:14:00] there's a man standing there
[1:14:04] and let's create in our image
[1:14:06] because i'm a man
[1:14:08] and i'm going to start talking and
[1:14:09] things are going to start coming to bend
[1:14:11] now see that's where i can understand
[1:14:13] right
[1:14:14] i can't understand that he covered all
[1:14:16] space time and eternity i can't
[1:14:17] understand he never had a beginning
[1:14:19] if you tried it
[1:14:21] go back 10 b
[1:14:25] there's not a beginning there
[1:14:27] but when i can see that he once started
[1:14:29] talking
[1:14:32] and i could understand because when he
[1:14:33] said let there be
[1:14:35] let there be let there be an earth we
[1:14:37] see the physical manifestation of what
[1:14:40] that word said
[1:14:41] because we're standing on it
[1:14:44] and we see it at night the stars the
[1:14:46] moon and all the different things so we
[1:14:48] see that that was great jehovah god went
[1:14:51] forth in a celestial body that's the
[1:14:53] logos that's a spirit
[1:14:56] everybody got that
[1:14:58] that's spirit form not flesh spirit form
[1:15:02] the word spoke out of them great
[1:15:04] fountains of life and went forth and
[1:15:06] there was the theophany which was god
[1:15:08] made into word
[1:15:11] do you know and i love that if you see
[1:15:13] it on we've got it right here and i
[1:15:15] think it's hanging up downstairs you see
[1:15:17] where the bible's laying open
[1:15:20] and the bible starts flipping the pages
[1:15:22] and when it does it's jesus
[1:15:24] stepping out of the pages of the bible
[1:15:26] and there's a human man
[1:15:28] because that's where he came from
[1:15:30] he came from that very word of god
[1:15:33] before the foundation of the world all
[1:15:35] right
[1:15:36] now but now what happened was there was
[1:15:38] a fall
[1:15:40] it didn't change the word of god it just
[1:15:41] made it more alive to me it may give
[1:15:43] more purpose
[1:15:45] like brother brown said more meaning and
[1:15:46] purpose
[1:15:47] in that he was a savior a healer a
[1:15:49] redeemer and all these different things
[1:15:50] all right so now let's read genesis 3
[1:15:53] 22.
[1:15:56] this is after the fall this is the way
[1:15:58] it is now i had to get us to the way it
[1:16:00] is now
[1:16:01] the way it is now
[1:16:03] man and woman gets together
[1:16:05] through a relationship
[1:16:07] and we have babies
[1:16:10] but then when you come to the age of
[1:16:12] accountability
[1:16:14] you got to decide
[1:16:16] whether you want to be a child of god or
[1:16:17] not everybody is that okay you didn't
[1:16:20] come here child of god
[1:16:22] you come here with a potential
[1:16:24] to be a child of god
[1:16:26] we were talking about that last night
[1:16:28] you come here with what representation
[1:16:30] you come here that god knowing that you
[1:16:32] would want it somewhere in your life you
[1:16:34] would want it
[1:16:36] because listen if you come here with
[1:16:37] something eternal in your soul
[1:16:41] come on i know the quotes we we talked
[1:16:43] about last night if you'd have been a
[1:16:44] bible study you wouldn't be standing
[1:16:45] where your eyes crossed
[1:16:48] because what are you going to do with
[1:16:49] salvation
[1:16:51] if you always was eternal what are you
[1:16:53] going to do with justification if you
[1:16:54] always if you came here with an eternal
[1:16:56] seed inside of you
[1:16:59] what are you going to do with jesus
[1:17:00] dying on cross he didn't need to
[1:17:03] you just needed to realize who you were
[1:17:07] listen even the woman at the well if you
[1:17:10] take the quotes of brother brown said
[1:17:11] see there that quickened her to eternal
[1:17:13] life there is no way
[1:17:16] now i'm not being contrary to brother
[1:17:17] branham i'm just telling you the truth
[1:17:18] there is no way that woman received
[1:17:20] eternal life in her soul
[1:17:22] standing there in front of the one that
[1:17:24] had eternal life
[1:17:26] because he had to release it she
[1:17:27] couldn't have got it before the
[1:17:28] disciples did
[1:17:31] how can a prostitute
[1:17:34] get eternal life in her soul before the
[1:17:37] people that uh
[1:17:38] peter had the keys to the kingdom she
[1:17:40] didn't
[1:17:42] so we didn't come that way
[1:17:44] she had to yeah it did the word
[1:17:47] quickened in her life she saw what god
[1:17:49] had already told her because remember
[1:17:50] she says we know
[1:17:53] when messiah comes
[1:17:54] she'd read the bible
[1:17:57] brother brown said maybe her mama read
[1:17:58] the bible to her
[1:18:00] and it quickened something she said oh
[1:18:02] we know when my son comes he'll do these
[1:18:04] things
[1:18:06] he said i am he well yeah that quickened
[1:18:08] something in her heart it quickened the
[1:18:09] desire
[1:18:11] to go tell somebody else
[1:18:14] but i'll promise you that girl had to go
[1:18:15] to the upper room to get the holy ghost
[1:18:19] you can't go contrary to the bible folks
[1:18:21] now you bring me 100 quotes
[1:18:23] i was the things i did in my life there
[1:18:26] was no eternal nothing inside of me
[1:18:29] it was all in the mind of god folks
[1:18:32] that's what brother adam was taking us
[1:18:34] into the mind of god
[1:18:37] because i'm going to tell you just like
[1:18:38] i told you before this is so simple
[1:18:40] god is a righteous judge
[1:18:44] if i get eternal life and i've already
[1:18:46] got it and i have to do nothing to get
[1:18:48] it and i'm just an eternal person
[1:18:50] because i got this seed laying inside of
[1:18:52] me
[1:18:53] but adolf hitler didn't
[1:18:57] now listen
[1:18:58] by predestination he didn't by
[1:19:00] predestination i did
[1:19:02] not by physical
[1:19:05] because when adolf hitler goes to the
[1:19:07] day of judgment when all things will be
[1:19:08] made known
[1:19:10] adolf hitler's going to say how can you
[1:19:12] judge that guy
[1:19:14] when you put something in him that you
[1:19:16] didn't put in me
[1:19:20] to me that's the simplest way to explain
[1:19:22] it
[1:19:22] we all came here lost
[1:19:25] we all came here brother brown said i
[1:19:27] was lost
[1:19:29] i would wash my car on sunday and watch
[1:19:32] people go to church
[1:19:35] i had to go to the woodshed or run down
[1:19:38] the um railroad tracks or wherever he
[1:19:40] received the holy ghost a prophet had to
[1:19:42] receive the holy ghost yes
[1:19:46] he didn't say something just quickened
[1:19:48] in my life he said no i had an
[1:19:50] experience
[1:19:54] one day i had an experience
[1:19:57] and i don't do the things i used to do
[1:20:02] so
[1:20:02] anyway and i know a lot of it's
[1:20:04] terminology but you got to really
[1:20:06] understand one thing if you just throw
[1:20:08] it out there and leave it that's what
[1:20:09] we're talking about last night you just
[1:20:10] throw a subject out there and just leave
[1:20:12] it
[1:20:13] then the people are going to get the
[1:20:14] idea that they were just something
[1:20:16] special when they were born and they got
[1:20:18] this eternal something that just stays
[1:20:20] in them and all of a sudden it goes i'm
[1:20:22] i'm saved
[1:20:24] no there's an explanation because you
[1:20:26] can't do away with calvary you can't do
[1:20:28] away with justification sanctification
[1:20:30] you can't do away with receipt why did
[1:20:32] what listen why
[1:20:34] i think i got it back there
[1:20:36] god
[1:20:38] after he was resurrected
[1:20:41] he meets the disciples
[1:20:44] and he breathes on him and says receive
[1:20:46] you the holy ghost
[1:20:48] now that was the word
[1:20:50] that didn't come from another preacher
[1:20:52] that was firsthand information
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:56] now why didn't if there was a seed
[1:20:57] laying in there why didn't it quicken
[1:20:59] right then they wouldn't have went to
[1:21:00] the upper room
[1:21:03] brother brown said that was what
[1:21:05] potential
[1:21:07] they had the potential because god saw
[1:21:09] they would go to the upper room that was
[1:21:11] in the mind of god and i believe jesus
[1:21:14] knew it and he was smiling when he said
[1:21:16] it
[1:21:17] but they had to go to the upper room 12
[1:21:18] or 11 days later on the day of pentecost
[1:21:21] to receive this lick of fire that
[1:21:24] brother brown said went in them
[1:21:26] why'd it have to go in them
[1:21:28] if it was already in them
[1:21:31] see what i mean folks
[1:21:33] just be careful we need to be careful
[1:21:35] and be
[1:21:36] not so much dogmatic but we need to
[1:21:37] watch what we're saying to people
[1:21:39] all right and the lord god said behold
[1:21:41] the man has become one of us to know
[1:21:43] good and evil
[1:21:46] and now lest he put forth his hand to
[1:21:47] take also the tree of life and eat and
[1:21:49] live forever therefore the lord god sent
[1:21:51] him forth out of the garden of eden to
[1:21:52] till the ground from whence he was taken
[1:21:55] so he drove out the man in other words
[1:21:56] he put him out of the garden
[1:22:00] and we've we've been out of the garden
[1:22:02] ever since
[1:22:03] that's right
[1:22:05] we're going we're trying to get back in
[1:22:06] the garden
[1:22:08] but we can't on this earth
[1:22:12] all right so he drove out the man and he
[1:22:14] placed at the east of the garden of eden
[1:22:16] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1:22:18] turned every way to keep the way
[1:22:21] of the tree of life
[1:22:23] now that was to keep them away brother
[1:22:25] brown said now since jesus christ died
[1:22:27] and went to calvary and opened all this
[1:22:29] back up again they're running us back to
[1:22:31] the tree of life
[1:22:33] because he is the tree of life it wasn't
[1:22:35] a tree standing there it was god it was
[1:22:38] christ
[1:22:40] it was the logos
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:44] genesis 6 5
[1:22:46] real quick and then we'll close right
[1:22:47] here
[1:22:49] i want to get to something look
[1:22:51] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[1:22:52] was great in the earth because we're
[1:22:54] going to skip all the way
[1:22:56] to
[1:22:57] noah
[1:22:58] because
[1:22:59] the bible says in luke that as it was in
[1:23:02] the days of noah so shall it be in the
[1:23:05] days of the son of man
[1:23:07] everybody got that all right
[1:23:09] so now remember
[1:23:10] when these son of man was standing on
[1:23:12] earth physical
[1:23:14] there wasn't a destruction afterwards
[1:23:16] anybody got that
[1:23:19] all right listen
[1:23:21] and it repented the lord that he had
[1:23:23] made man on the earth and it grieved him
[1:23:25] at his heart
[1:23:26] god's got a heart
[1:23:29] you know why because you got one
[1:23:32] because we were made in his image
[1:23:34] and it repented the lord that he had
[1:23:36] made man on the earth and it grieved him
[1:23:38] in his heart and the lord said i will
[1:23:40] destroy man whom i have created from the
[1:23:42] face of the earth isn't that what we're
[1:23:44] facing right now
[1:23:46] you know what we're facing when the son
[1:23:47] of man is revealed and we leave this
[1:23:49] earth there's going to be a destruction
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:53] same way when the son of man was
[1:23:54] revealed to abraham we'll get to it
[1:23:56] tonight this afternoon when the son of
[1:23:58] man was revealed to abraham in
[1:23:59] melchizedek what happened to sodom and
[1:24:02] gomorrah there was a destruction
[1:24:04] amen and the lord said i will destroy
[1:24:06] man whom i have created from the face of
[1:24:08] the earth both man and beast and
[1:24:09] creeping things and fowls of the air for
[1:24:11] it repenteth me that i have made them
[1:24:14] but noah
[1:24:16] found grace
[1:24:19] in the eyes of the lord
[1:24:21] that was one man
[1:24:23] and really remember now remember
[1:24:26] there was eight souls saved but that's
[1:24:28] not even talking about the bride
[1:24:30] enough was the type of the son of man
[1:24:35] and he was called up way before this
[1:24:38] okay
[1:24:39] all right so let's get into something
[1:24:40] just real quick luke 17 verse 26 and i
[1:24:43] got a few comments right here and it was
[1:24:45] in the days of noah or noe so shall that
[1:24:48] be in the days of the son of man that's
[1:24:52] us
[1:24:53] not back two thousand years ago he's
[1:24:55] talking about us because brother brown
[1:24:56] how many times did he quote luke 17 30.
[1:24:59] he said that's this day
[1:25:02] they did eat they drank they married
[1:25:03] wives they were given in marriage until
[1:25:05] the day that noah entered in the ark and
[1:25:08] the flood came and destroyed them all
[1:25:11] now let's look and see though
[1:25:13] what happens here because it's it's a
[1:25:16] type of hair because it says in the days
[1:25:17] of the son of man so i mean noah is to
[1:25:19] be in the son of man
[1:25:22] now remember there were three types of
[1:25:23] people in noah's age
[1:25:25] as we're going to talk about tonight
[1:25:26] there was three in lots time or in
[1:25:28] abraham's time but there was three in
[1:25:30] noah's time
[1:25:32] the center that didn't care what noah
[1:25:34] was talking about
[1:25:35] right right the mate believer that hung
[1:25:37] around the ark
[1:25:40] and and them the ones that talk to no no
[1:25:42] are you sure it's gonna rain
[1:25:44] listen they were seven billion people on
[1:25:45] the earth probably seven or six point
[1:25:47] eight of them didn't even know noah
[1:25:49] existed
[1:25:51] they probably just heard a little
[1:25:52] something you know there's an idiot down
[1:25:54] there making a boat it ain't never rain
[1:25:56] but there were some people that actually
[1:25:57] got close to noah and said noah what are
[1:25:59] you doing
[1:26:01] hey there's nothing up there
[1:26:03] it will rain he said
[1:26:06] 120 years the prophet of god said 120
[1:26:09] years
[1:26:10] god was so long suffering to get the
[1:26:12] elect in
[1:26:14] and only eight people were saved
[1:26:17] in 120 years of preaching
[1:26:19] eight people
[1:26:21] were saved
[1:26:22] and one of them was the devil
[1:26:26] ham
[1:26:27] brother brown said ham brought the you
[1:26:29] know across the ark the unbelief
[1:26:33] all right listen to this
[1:26:35] also
[1:26:37] yeah i'm done with the quotes that's
[1:26:38] okay listen to this
[1:26:42] remember what happened when noah
[1:26:43] finished preaching
[1:26:45] what happened
[1:26:47] god said go get in the ark
[1:26:50] right
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:52] and they were there seven days
[1:26:56] why seven days
[1:26:58] they were there for seven church ages
[1:27:02] there were seven church ages god called
[1:27:04] out a bride
[1:27:06] to save them
[1:27:08] and then god said i'm done
[1:27:12] shut the door
[1:27:15] now listen to
[1:27:16] this genesis 7 verse 4 they don't have
[1:27:20] it listen for yet seven days and i will
[1:27:22] cause it to rain upon the earth 40 days
[1:27:24] and 40 nights this is genesis 7 4
[1:27:27] and every living thing that i have made
[1:27:29] will i destroy
[1:27:31] from off of the face of the earth
[1:27:33] now what does rain mean
[1:27:36] rain means a message
[1:27:38] remember former rain
[1:27:40] former rain is a teaching rain ladder
[1:27:42] rain is a harvest rain
[1:27:46] see
[1:27:47] this day and time if it's as it was in
[1:27:49] the days of noah
[1:27:51] we get a seven seal
[1:27:54] rain
[1:27:56] in the end time we get a seven seal
[1:27:58] reign in the end time because it's
[1:28:01] coming to maturity
[1:28:04] that's the son of man that's why those
[1:28:06] two scriptures are connected why would
[1:28:07] it say in the days of noah
[1:28:09] as it was going to be in the days of the
[1:28:11] son of man as it wasn't days another
[1:28:12] there's got to be a connection
[1:28:14] now they didn't come to maturity but me
[1:28:17] and you are going to have to come to
[1:28:18] maturity to get out of here
[1:28:21] we got to have a seven seal rain
[1:28:23] something that's going to what harvest
[1:28:25] us off this earth
[1:28:27] and what is a harvest it's when you
[1:28:29] collect something and you take it
[1:28:31] and use it
[1:28:33] we're going to be harvested off this
[1:28:35] earth
[1:28:36] and then god's not going to flood the
[1:28:38] earth again because he promised he
[1:28:39] wasn't he's going to destroy it by fire
[1:28:42] so as it was in the days of the son of
[1:28:44] man we've listened we've listened we've
[1:28:46] read we've listened
[1:28:48] we're like i said before let's stand to
[1:28:50] our feet we're trying to do the things
[1:28:51] that we're doing
[1:28:53] just listen keep pressing keep trying
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:59] as we said last night
[1:29:01] listen
[1:29:02] it's only human
[1:29:06] listen to me now
[1:29:07] you're going to have to agree with me
[1:29:08] because it happens to all of us
[1:29:12] when you have a goal
[1:29:14] and you set a goal like dave ramsey
[1:29:19] when you set a goal
[1:29:21] and that goal's been set and then when
[1:29:24] that goal's been met what's the first
[1:29:26] thing you do humanly
[1:29:31] i did it
[1:29:33] right
[1:29:35] last night i said well we just fold it
[1:29:36] you know we do this put the little straw
[1:29:38] in our mouth and we
[1:29:40] you know
[1:29:41] i made it
[1:29:42] i got the holy ghost
[1:29:44] i fought i know i got the holy ghost
[1:29:47] and then humanly we go
[1:29:50] okay i'm done
[1:29:52] no
[1:29:54] that just starts to fight
[1:29:57] that just starts to fight
[1:30:00] you need to press your way through that
[1:30:03] thinking
[1:30:04] that you've got it and you're done
[1:30:07] sure you've got it you're done your seal
[1:30:08] but listen god doesn't want that
[1:30:11] he wants us to press paul said press
[1:30:13] toward the mark of the high calling push
[1:30:16] yes
[1:30:17] make the devil mad i believe we have
[1:30:21] make you mad
[1:30:23] listen if you're a child of god he can't
[1:30:25] harm you unless god let's him
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:28] so you got to put yourself behind the
[1:30:30] promises of god
[1:30:33] and listen see this son of man sure it's
[1:30:36] great to have the holy ghost it's great
[1:30:37] to come into the family of god and have
[1:30:40] the faith of god but you still got all
[1:30:42] that growing to do
[1:30:45] like i said
[1:30:46] before if they took little scarlet
[1:30:50] when she was born a year ago she's just
[1:30:52] a year older or the baby
[1:30:55] violet sorry violet scarlet violet okay
[1:30:58] violet's a year old now what if they
[1:31:00] would have all left a year ago buddy oh
[1:31:03] that we saw the picture
[1:31:05] oh hallelujah it's a baby it got here
[1:31:08] it's breathing
[1:31:10] it's a it's a human
[1:31:12] and it's a breathing human being
[1:31:14] now what if she took it and said well
[1:31:16] i'm done
[1:31:19] i'm done that my my job's done i birthed
[1:31:21] this thing
[1:31:23] mama i birthed this thing i'm done
[1:31:26] i got the baby here
[1:31:28] no that's just when the struggle begins
[1:31:33] everybody has kids say
[1:31:36] and it still happens even when they're
[1:31:38] 30 and 40 and all the way up that way so
[1:31:39] anyway
[1:31:41] but you know what you just keep going
[1:31:42] moms you ever quit loving your kids
[1:31:45] don't matter what they do you still love
[1:31:47] them god's the same way
[1:31:49] but god wants to feed you so you can
[1:31:51] grow up
[1:31:52] god don't want you to be a baby no more
[1:31:54] he loves that you become a baby because
[1:31:56] he saw that but he also wants you to
[1:31:58] grow
[1:32:00] and grow and how do you grow
[1:32:02] eat
[1:32:04] eat the word of god and you'll grow
