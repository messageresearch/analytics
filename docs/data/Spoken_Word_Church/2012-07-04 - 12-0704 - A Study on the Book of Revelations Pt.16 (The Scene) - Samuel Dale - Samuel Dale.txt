be leaving about 10:00 and and going up so remember that amen right you like turn in your scriptures turn in Revelations 1 where we've been reading and then we will go to it's Revelation 1 1-3 then we will go to 1 Peter 1 verse 9-13 amen our precious Lord and our savior Our Redeemer our all in all and Jesus Jesus is your name thank you for your loving grace unto us father thank you for you and the hour that we're living thank you for the word that you've revealed unto us and the time that you've given us the guidance you've been with us to take care of us Lord and and all the things that we're doing life and just being with us we thank you we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence tonight and speak to our hearts that we may Lord convey your message to your people yes Lord because we look forward to you we love you and we thank you and guide us now and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and let's go over now to First Peter one starting at verse 9 receiving the end of your salvation even it's the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching are what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before him the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated to Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now this statement revelation of Jesus Christ appears three times in the Bible it's in Galatians 1 uh verse 12 by the revelation of Jesus Christ we read here in First Peter it says at the revelation of Jesus Christ and then in Revelations 1:1 we read the revelation of Jesus Christ now that's what we've been talking about it's not a u idea or thought it's a revelation and it must be revealed unto each one of our hearts and our lives all right now we took a lot of reading Sunday in the uh trying to read a lot Sunday afternoon of chapter 5 not reading the the U scripture part but reading the things brother brandom was saying about chapter 5 and U then we come to the point and we'll read it again in a minute where brother BR said this is the a scene it's not a verse by verse right all right so then we'll get down to it in a minute to see why it comes out to be that way but we tried to cover it and we read a lot now tonight we only have like four quotes So what I want to do is basically just uh speak about it and you know and and maybe help us to understand uh what we're talking about now we've been Revelations 5 verse1 and that's all in the right hand of him him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals now we're not going to be dealing with the part word that it's written within on the back side of the book Etc we'll take that up the Lord withing Sunday all we want to talk about tonight is one thing of what we we went through and go ahead and pull up number one on the notes brother and let's get these out of the way and then we can just speak on these things this is taken from uh Revelation 5 part 2 1961 618 paragraphs 79 and 80 now we find in that this first beginning of the chapter we find the the fifth chapter is just a TI Block it's a diamond hitch in other words something that pulls together fisons uh you can use the word breach all right yep breach would be the same form but you got to have something to come across and tie together in a breach but it is the same wording to where that you can understand it and see what's going on Tai hits that Diamond hits that ties a life part of the church age of the third chapter why because the Rapture comes at the end of the third chapter Revelation 4:1 we go up in the Rapture all right the fourth chapter tells what John was taken up into heaven and the fifth is prepare preparing for these all right we went through the seven Church ages then John's lifted up in the fourth chapter in the fifth chapter he's just setting a scene here for the opening of The Seven Seals now the word seen means a place where some action or event occurs all right an action or event or it's all right it means any view or like a picture right all right it's actually the um it's actually a a single episode yeah of a play right is what a scene is cuz you got many scenes put together that makes a movie right right you don't say the whole movie is a scene you have a scene and then it breaks and you have a scene especially where you're dealing with like I was bringing out Sunday where you're dealing with like a stage act you you open the St stage and there's the actors you know in place and that's a scene well then that you act that part out they close the curtains and you open up and then another scene comes into view but I like this one and you'll see when we get to it in a minute a scene is a incident or situation in real life so remember that it's an incident or a situation in real life okay so now we we'll hold to that point but look what he's saying see all right he's just setting a scene here for the opening of The Seven Seals just as he did in the first chapter of Revelations what opening the way for the church ages now what happened there there he stands in the seven golden candlesticks Revelations 13 he needs to look upon his Jasper and sard of stone and he's preparing for those that seven golden County looks Upon A J is preparing for the seven Church ages all right right now now he's preparing for the opening of those Seven Seals of redemption see that's what the fifth chapter is that's the reason I think that's the reason I kind of read it and just take it from there and talk on it and give the other parts of the scriptures is because it isn't verse by verse something that's happening it's preparing for something to happen now watch it and if you get the preparation then you just you're ready for it then and That's the Way It Is by faith or anything else so anything we get needs a preparation right right right a a a thing to to be able to help us to understand all right now and see then we gave you where you don't have to pull up the number two but we gave you where brother brand talks about in the seal book in the breach where he said this Revelation chap 5 is the most Sublime scripture in the Bible right all right because it's explaining something but watch now is preparing for the opening now what does that mean to you the prophet said it's preparing for the opening what would that mean right now he said as we read there that in chapter one Jesus standing in the midst of seven golden Candlestick and you're actually pulling that over in Revelations 4 uh to pick up the Sardis Stone and and all like that is high two scripture together but he's used in Revelations one where he standing in the midst of seven golden Candlestick like unto the son of man that's a foundation he said or a preparation to be able to understand the church AG all right now so then the fifth chapter is a preparation to understand the opening of the seals right and like we've talking about Sunday and you know you you're preparing an event you you're getting ready for some kind of event a wedding or or whatever or some kind of a a doing the shower or something that your sisters do it takes a lot of preparation sure I mean it's not just well we'll see you well when you going to see me well I don't know we we're going to have a wedding well when you going to have it don't know we'll call you when everybody's ready now what kind of an event would that be amen did that would be just a halfhazard thought and that's what we do in our minds of the Bible and the prophet's message is we just halfhazard think about something you know we say well why is it so important for us to understand Revelations 4 and 5 and all just get over into and we really don't even need them sealed we just we just believe the prophet's message well I thought the prophet's message beun the seal amen I thought that's what he said right amen but you see that's the way we do things we do it just you know nonchalant now you don't do a wedding that way do you right so you set a date you prepare everything you get everything ready and the closer you get more you just working like everything to get it to a place to where that you can have this wedding all right now all of that is the preparation that's not the wedding right so now understand what he's saying here Revelation 5 is a preparing now there is a quote in here who said this is actually opening the seals but I'm holding that for a long time AR another message or two but than about it what is the preparing now I took quite a while in dealing with the fourth chapter of the Book of Revelations and inside of that I kept giving you quotes and I'd say write this down because it will be needful later some of you did a lot of you probably didn't because you didn't consider it to be important enough but I was actually preaching the sermon there within those things and trying to Enlighten our eyes to where that we could look at it but a scene preparing for the opening right now we look in Revelations 51 as we read and we see one sitting on the throne all right we see a book in his hand as I said we won't be dealing with that but that's identically the same thing that you see over in chapter 4 there right on verse two it says there a throne in heaven and one sitting on the throne all right now to me I don't believe you can understand chapter 5 until you fully understand chapter 4 and that was the reason for preaching uh 13 or so many sermons 14 or something 15 on the you know chapter 4 because chapter 4 is a verse by verse description then when you get into chapter 5 it's a scene see chapter 4 describes what's taking place chapter 5 it just opens up and when it opens up there you are a throne right and one sitting on the throne wrong right all right now see by doing that as I said I spent much time trying to get us to understand and to see what that Throne was we said well I it's just a throne sitting up there well that's that's all right but that's up in heaven right yep we found out from chapter 4 that this Throne was the father's Throne are the baptism of the Holy Ghost they come on the day of Pentecost in the new birth right right all right starting in the heart of man with the father's strong in our hearts and one day we will go to that throne and sit with him but if if we don't have it right here we're not going die that's right right if we don't match on Earth what is dark we're not going there that's right so where are we in we're in the preparation we're then the point of getting ready to be able to to see it all right now let me ask you a question a couple of messages down the road so I will jot this down will your Revelation produce a lamb for you right right simple question will your Revelation produce a lamb for you no I don't need to produce it brother they God produced it that's good but this is something personal that's right that's what I want you to see about the fifth chapter it is something personal that's taking place right now that's right that's right cuz if we're not in the preparation right then it'll never come forth in the right order right all right now you'll see why we've been around here 40 years in the time of preparation yeah instead of just saying well boy bless God we got it the prophet said it that's the way people are right that Prophet themselves broke to the prophet amen we got it work right still worse than all than any organized religion group of people right y still messed up and the people W even talk to each other fellowship or anything that's right but now think about it in Revelations CH 4 we started off talking about a throne in heaven right but we said that Throne as I said a moment ago had to be in our hearts right by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right or there wouldn't be a throne in heaven for us to go to so do you realize what I'm saying the baptism in of the Holy Ghost in your heart is making way for that throne in heaven it's not that throne in heaven making a way for us on Earth we're making a way here on Earth to that to be prepared right if we can go there if we don't see it we can't understand it we if it's not prepared for us all right now see then we read first Peter and he's talking about at the revelation of Jesus Christ right now the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ right not just the Book of Revelation right right we'll read this in a second the entire Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ right brother said if you read anywhere in the Bible and you don't see Christ he said go back and read it again because you missed it y right he said well there's a lot in the Bible about the things that happen this that and the other yeah and you see Christ in there we deal more Sunday about these things and try to get into a foundation right but if we don't understand chapter 4 and seeing the preparation and what has been taking place then chapter 5 means nothing to us it's just a double scene of what you saw in chapter 4 but now as I told you when I was doing that series then you'll see it it opens up all right you see a throne then you see one on the throne then you seen the 24 Elders then you seen the rainbow you seen the different things all right now chapter 5 is not a verse by verse The Prophet's not going to take it verse by verse but he is taking it verse by verse he's explaining it but he's already explained it in chapter 4 that's the point I want you to see so then it comes forth as a scene something that's actually happening and it's a preparing yeah right for these things to happen all right now at the revelation of Jesus Christ so then the entire book is that Revelation and Revelations 5 then is showing one picture a scene that covers all that took place in chapter 4 do you understand what I'm saying so then I could have brought it out and said well here because remember it says a picture y the scene is like a picture but see you could have dra out the throne one sitting on the throne and a book in his hand and you just stuck it up here and said there's the scene but how did you know that took place everything you read is a foundation right sure everything you study is a foundation that's why it's so vital to study if we don't get a foundation what are we going to do somebody just come out and preach a message and just run across it oh you get up in the spirit and rejoice with them Etc but then when it's finished you say what say I don't know but it's good message yeah but if you've had a foundation right then the preacher is not going to lose you right right see we've had years to lay Foundation to get ready for the things that God wants to do all right now see then you can't see Revelations five unless you understand Revelations 4 as being an explanation of what has taken place upon this Earth where did 24 Elders come from right here upon the Earth where's the one on the throne he's on the throne of your heart now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right so then you see in chapter 5 a scene of a throne and one sitting on the throne and a book in his hand and there's no way to understand chapter 6 until we get chapter 5 right are you following me yeah M all right in other words what was made known of the true revelation of Jesus Christ and the opening of the word was the preparing of the prophet to be able to speak right when it come to chapter six of the opening of the seals right see a lot of people say well brother Randon was wrong before the seals broke he was all messed up show it to me you have one thing that you can deal with and that's the white horse rider or you might make evidences of this and evidence but remember he's growing in Grace and knowledge too all right but you can deal with the or it's right but just remember no light had ever shined on that so it's not responsible even Jesus said if I hadn't come and spoke to you you would have had a covering for your sins right right but said I spoke to you now you have no covering Therefore your sins remain words he brought them out in the open he exposed him all right see then if the prophet wasn't right how could have God opened the word right how can a trinitarian concept understand any of the Bible right I mean any of it whatsoever how can you do it with a contrary with a concept of a trinitarianism because it's contrary to the Bible and the Antichrist Devil's teaching so are you saying that the devil has more understanding about God than God can bring not quite now folks see then a trinitarian concept can never see a true revelation of one God right it don't matter any Scripture talking about one Goden and truly when you come to the opening of the seals How would a trinitarian understand because the first seal said what the white horse rider rides out we see in the trinitarian concept you can just have one going this way and one going that way one going that way just all kind of things and you know that was the Holy Ghost with the little Aras of cupid shooting you know the hearts of the people and we think well now that's silly but you know that's what some people will believe her brother Randon wouldn't referred to it he had run into that Doctrine might have believed some of it himself when he first started you know we think he knowed everything but he said I used to think he in one of these quotes here that we'll get to in a second he said I used to think that that Jesus loved me and God hated me he said I found out it the same person then he begin to understand he couldn't be that way but now listen see I I just read through Sunday to get it laid down for a long you know good many messages but here's my point if brother randam was wrong you know before the seals broke when he come up to that place then there's no way that God could have come to him and that's right and give it to him amen he was standing there with the faith of the fathers reveal word of God and then God could open the word to him all right but now how can you and I do it you remember the word sing has to do with a personal experience that's where the trouble with people is see we take our own concept right and most of that is a hold over from the old religious ideas Y and then we try to understand God's word and how can that be done you see why that we need the background you see why we've needed 40 something years since the prophets Left Right amen we've needed it to get a background of preparing y now what if you went somewhere now give an illustration P you know preparing backgrounds Etc here we go you go somewhere and and you you was a trinitarian you was you know the old days and and you walk into a church and somebody preaches one God and you say amen that's right that's what I believe believe one God especially if you badst cuz that's their Doctrine one God then you say well now how do you explain that to me well what it is now it's God in three persons Blessed Trinity right now your background has been what come on your background has been God in three persons it's not been a revelation of one God or you wouldn't have made that statement it's like I told you that's what I told Brother Mo when he asked me I said one true and living God he said explain it I said God and three person well see when he said you're as much trinitarian as anybody else person's a personality personality an individual individual is a person right well it didn't take me no six months to figure that out I looked at and said I don't believe that no more now if you ask me said what do you believe I said well I don't really know exactly yet but I know I don't believe that right because I believe in progressive revelation I believe every day we must get a background that's why it says in the Bible give me this day my daily bread now you don't take a baby uh join Rachel he call said it'd be viewing in tonight and know because the little baby you know taking care of it and know but you know you don't take that baby and it's laying there you know just born and you handed a piece of chicken boy we're feeding that baby we want him to grow up right you know what I said the other day you got all these people that write books about raising kids and all Bachelors are old maids you ain't somebody that that's raised kids that writes a book but see they pervert people's Mind by telling you you not do this or not do that why we got raised and when they raised us by sticking the finger in the gravy and putting it in your mouth not too long after we were born and we lived you know but you see all of it now is is on you know don't do this don't do that trying to tell you how to do things well now about 6 months from now a year from later they'll rewrite the book right amen and then they'll tell you not to give them what you give them here well they might as well forget it but you understand what I'm trying to say that church if we don't have a background an understanding of preparation then somebody preaches one God to us we don't know whether it's right or not right amen right right I've heard preachers preach a sermon you know people would come out wouldn't that the greatest sermon you ever heard and you just got to bite your tongue and walk away because it was all false but to them it was the greatest thing that ever been heard well they preached one he said three times he believed in one God so does the Baptist you want to go right over there so was a Baptist they believe in one God but you see your background is where the thing is at if you and I don't have a background by now yeah we're in bad shape right right see because we're subject to all kind of errors and doctrines without your background first off you got to have a new birth right right that's what it's talking about in Revelations 4 it comes up to show in Revelations 5 that new birth in your heart's got to be there but then a background an understanding and God speaking personally to you because no matter how much background you got if God don't speak to you we're still messed up it don't matter how much we can say that was true and it could be true but what do we get out of it that's right you know what do we get out of the message do you get what I'm trying to say or are you getting the words I'm saying cuz I'm trying my best to explain one true and living God you'll see what I'm talking about because that's been the whole basis of chapter 4 was to preach about one God and where he was at and the 24 Elders the rainbow and the The Jasper and the sarden stone and all I'm preaching about Goden now we come to see all of that as a background and God's going to show us something am but he's not going to show us what we think see why didn't God go from Revelation 4 in verse one right on over to Revelation 6 in verse one and start with the seals now why didn't he do that because he knew he wouldn't understand right he knew we couldn't comprehend he knew the prophet couldn't even comprehend yeah so we had to give him the background of all of the years that he preached was a background to me that was what the Lord showed me see when when that white horse rider went riding out all the Holy Ghost had to say to the prophet was said what have you taught all your life he said one one person one true and living God and it correct one person he said well then here you stand with the Holy Ghost and our goost the white horse rider that's leaving you so what do you got see if that have been a holy ghost you better go ride with it right but see he could tie back into his message and get him to see the revelation of Jesus Christ that's right cuz that's the entire Bible pull those up brothers let's just get those and we got little number three number four let's just bring these up this is in the first seal 19 uh 63 3:18 as we study this chapter we are referring different places even to Old and New Testament life because the entire book is the revelation of Jesus Christ the entire book that's all together the revelation of of the Lord Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ is God revealing himself in the book revealing himself through Christ in the book and Christ is the revelation of God he come to reveal God because he and God was the same God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now so what did it turn out to be in other words you'd never know just what God was until he revealed himself through Christ then you can see I used to think years ago that maybe God was angry with me but Christ loved me now this is a prophet talking come to find out it's the same person see and Christ is the very Heart Of God right look at the next one just getting the point where you're at this is Jesus Christ same yesterday today in Forever 1963 606 that's kind of been a theme with me in the campaigns that I would use that because I believe the entire book is a revelation of Jesus Christ and he is the same yesterday today and forever now he's the same yesterday today and forever then the entire book that we'll get to Sunday the book that is in the hand of the one sitting on the throne do we want to just read it and just jump out this the book in his hand one on thr one come tou the book out his hand well where did all that come from where did the glamb come from and will your revelation put you in a position to understand the opening of the word I know I'm slow I want to be slow what about it what if the world was dependent upon you you getting scripture okay they without us can can notot be made perfect that Sol it Hebrews 11:40 I guess it is so the world's waiting on you well I don't know where well then you're not part of it is that sensible if the world's not waiting on you you're not part of it but if you're part of it then it's waiting on you the bride is part of the mystery Christ The Mystery of God revealed right and she must be revealed am right now I've told you though this is a ever service I make this statement then in the Book of Revelations you don't find Jesus Christ by himself you find him in the people or revealing himself in the people right chapter one one standing in the midst of seven golden Candlestick like the son of man G about the POU with the golden girdle then we go to the church ages and he would revealing himself in the church ages then we went to chapter 4 of a Rapture and and showed how that that if it hadn't been the revelation of Jesus Christ we wouldn't have been going in a Rapture there would't be a Rapture without a revelation of Jesus Christ but with your Revelation what is your Revelation why do you believe what you believe you know that most people would say I don't really know right that's right but what if you was asked what if there was a large group of people dependent upon your Revelation you'd be more serious wouldn't you that's what if it is that the bride of Christ down through all the ages is now 2,000 years have died and went into the ground and waiting on you well I don't have to understand I just believe it brother around said a true Eagle will understand if he's a true eagle see what if the world's waiting on you and I right amen according to the prophet and according to the Bible that's what it did that's right what is it Church preparing the years of preparation that that Prophet went through he preached 30 something years before he could preach this is his words before he could preach the statue of perfect man y get the book read it it's in the message 30 something years before he could preach yet I can show you back in the 50s that was 62 I think it's right somewhere right there and I I show you in the 50s where he was preaching on those things but he didn't see it tied together see cuz he said I didn't see this tied together to the other day I didn't good that honey you see we thank brother around come here with everything now he says he didn't he said I don't know what that that first seal is then when he open the first sheld over he said I don't know what the second one is third one that's his words what are you doing with his words because of our thoughts and our ideas of our mind what are we doing but what if it is that's the that's the only thing that's on my mind tonight is one thing you don't get nothing out of the message tonight get one thing will your Revelation bring God on the scene I don't have to do that he just come because he said he's coming well that's the good bad dist thought and that's what they say but what about it right but do you read and do you study the prophet's message do you listen to the tapes and you preparing right or have you got some concept of something that you've done or didn't do has made you to world that you're in the message right I said did or didn't do either way see what about your Revelation brother collie what if this whole church is dependent upon what you believe are you willing to take that responsibility that's right do when I get up here preaching that's what I have to do right amen amen you can sit there and do all you want to but I can't right see cuz I realize that if I don't preach it correctly we won't make it amen now you you say well what do you mean I won't make it I'll go somewhere else well go on then right amen that's the best way to say it that way it don't keep no bone picking with nobody don't stay here because of me because your soul is involved that's right right now if you want your soul lost and you think I'm lost then you're going to be lost yeah right that's just plain language I don't mind talking but what if everybody's waiting on you amen now you know the world was waiting on brother ROM to come that's what it means Malachi 4 you know all those scriptures now had he not come where would we be and you and I are totally dependent upon whether or not he was the prophet of God now the way it's going now and the people of the message you know for certainty it's not that way because they're just some going back to organized religion and some going back to all these other things right some just leaving to church and just going home and but what if it's dependent upon you and I do we have enough preparation right if you was taken in court today to be tried about this message now they don't care about you saying that brother around as a prophet you know then they ask you was what he teach see whether you like it or not we're dependent upon this message and whether you like it or not you're dependent upon the five-fold ministry to break it down to you amen and if you don't like that then I'd suggest you go home and listen to T because because there's no need of you wearing yourself out in cars too coming to church if you're not dependent upon what's being brought that's that's right right you shouldn't talk that way why not why not do you know that I believe and I've always talked to you this that no man is to have brother Ram's Ministry by himself anymore brother Ram had the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ right right Amen to the resurrection to All Things No one person is to have that again but the prophet said the bride would have the ministry of Jesus Christ that's right yep all right so around the world is the brde of Jesus Christ ain't just Lula Georgia right no bride of Christ around the world then you know what that that means that you and I are going to have a portion of the word sure right and they're going to have a portion here and a portion there and a portion here and overseas has got a portion these places got a portion when it's all put together it'll be the word of God right amen but what if we don't have our portion right right amen very serious amen you so I'm just a housewife what have I got to do with it well even the garden you know I believe that this she could have spoke the word no it's only Adam well all right she had God living in her too right see you sisters got your part amen we just know it's not in the pull pit right but you got your part raising a family and helping one another right that's your part well you know if you don't Supply your part then you know that we're missing that part right who was listening to a tape the other day and brother Ram they asked him a question said should women brother brandham have a Ministry like you know not a Ministry like preaching should women have a uh uh you know an outside work to where that they could work and do things he said yes sir right I remember an old Baptist lady in our church she said if I could talk to somebody about the Lord I'd never make my bed of a morning you know she meant it she meant it you serious what about you and me you said what are you talking I'm talking about that without the opening of the word of Revelations 1 I went through that and over and over and over you'd never be able to understand what happened in the church ages and theight and you'd never understand the Rapture and why it took place but then we went into chapter 4 and we've spent 15 or something sermons talking about the requirements the thing God was expecting of you and I I wasn't preaching about what was in heaven I kept telling you that everybody wants to go to heaven with their their mind so fast what you know you can become so Heavenly minded to you're no earthly good and I mean that in the true real of this way you can become so Heavenly minded until you can't even get a revelation yet you're so revelated you think you got all of it yeah but what about it you remember a little boy that one day asked his mother he said mother can you see God yeah she said you'll have to ask your Sunday school teacher the little boy asked a Sunday school teacher can you see God well you better go to the pastor when I got to the pastor and he said can you see God and the Pastor said no you can't see God well you remember what happened he went fishing with the old gentleman you know the old gentleman was crying so cuz he saw the rainbow and all like that in the clouds and he he realized that there was something about the man he said can you see God he said all that I've ever seen in my life is God Amen now listen folks what if your kids comes and asks you can you see God right I like what uh I won't call the name but certain person one time claimed to be highly religious and his wife told said if that's what you call religion I don't want it yeah where is our lives LED people to Christ right and we got this great Revelation but where's our lives LED people to Christ can they say about you that that's a good Christian they might say oh we don't agree with them in Doctrine but they're good people at least that's the way it should be you know what about it what would be ha what would be coming this is whole what I'm trying to bring out tonight what would be the next next step of what you're thinking whatever you're thinking you know what what's going to be the thing to bring the Rapture the change you know the the won't twinkle and eye what do you think what do you think's going to bring see in the message day every time a young man comes along with a pretty good delivery and this that and the other the people just flock to it right even in the message people they just flock to that cuz they think that's a deliverer what if this whole thing is dependent upon you in your part that's right what do you think is going to bring you don't ever think like this you don't ever ask God God what's wrong right you know why are we around here why we're here 40 something years after the prophet's come you don't ever ask him about that you're not concerned about it what if it's because of you remember your Prophet said one unconfessed sin in any member in the church would cause the church to bitterly fail said you'd answer it judgment is that right do we believe that but what if the world's waiting on you now brother Dale we we know so much word at Lula till everybody else's they need to get where we're at you ain't never heard me say that that's right I believe God has been abundance to us in Revelation I do I agree but I've never said that the world's totally waiting on Lula but I say it's waiting on the bride of Christ around the world to realize who she is and only when she realizes who she is will she be gone now we're going to get into something on the steals one of these days that I tried to preach 30 years ago couldn't get people to see it how many of you rem me making this statement on the seal that some of you have heard of I said when that seventh seal is open to an individual they're sealed in that's right Satan sealed out right right I was talking about something then see I never preached nothing in no sealed in 82 there 83 but Jesus Christ and where he was at because chapter 5 if we can't see ourselves in chapter 5 verse one the first part of verse one the throne one sitting on the throne if we can't see ourselves there then there's no need of going to chapter six and the seals and the breaking and thing cuz you see write this one down this bride has got to give birth to the lamb right I tried to say that in ' 82 and ' 83 and it didn't go across she's got to give birth to the lamb now folks it ain't what brother so and so preached and his people said that he was standing between them them and God you know and it was his Revelation now I didn't believe it then I don't believe it now it's not totally dependent upon me it's totally dependent upon on the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world that's right I just want to be my part but the world's waiting on you and I right what kind of book is that oh we can describe it's a scroll brother Dale it's and I've been through that and explained it cuz was necessary but what kind of a book is it I wondered how many of you notice what I've done in chapter 4 I talked about the throne and the things and your experience I didn't deal very much with us sitting in that throne with him I didn't deal with it just a little cuz that was preparation now as we enter the fifth chapter if we don't see ourselves on the throne sitting on that throne with him then you're still a trinitarian and you totally Miss what I was just saying about when the Eagles come are the appearing of the Eagles plural they were the little eaglets right you know that brother around said God is not complete without you it's letay on my desk we'll get down to that he's not complete without you remember a scene is what what did we cover a scene was an incident or situation in real life but R said he will become so visible Among Us that he'll raise the dead we'll go in the Rapture where does he come from to become visible to us I've told you what I say about the tent and return Ministries and things like that it's not because of anybody believing it the only thing is I ask the same question I asked at the beginning I told the people in the beginning I said if brother Brown come back and put up a tent right here in front of this church you wouldn't know what he's talking about cuz you don't know what he's talking about I would say you know said so and so they say where's that at I got to where I was carrying books with me why because they didn't know that's what he' said right the first message I preached in 1969 was that the Bride of Jesus Christ must be the son of man the word made flesh amen you think I don't believe that still today but what about it all the years of preparation brother brandom to where that God could speak to him right and tell him about that white horse rider yep if it took him 30 something years to preach a statue of perfect man it took him 30 something years to come to the place he could preach the seals right right well he tried to preach him right come on he did he tried to preach the seal back there in his early Ministry and he had those notes off of it and that's what he was going to preach that opening of the seals you know when they come to jerus De that's what he's going to preach that's what he said he's going back to his old notes why because he didn't know anything different but then God made him but this is what I wrote down do you see my point will your Revelation prepare him a throne for him to sit on will your Revelation prepare a throne wait a minute you say I'm not responsible where'd you get that idea right oh Lord you never got it from here and you never got it from Brother random and you never got it out of the Bible where'd you get that idea I'm just as blun as I can be you had to get it from the devil because you certainly didn't get it from God because it Ain God's word God's words tells us we're all responsible the prophet said we're all responsible and we give an account of responsibility right what if the world's waiting on you and I right we think they we think that we're waiting on them to get to a place no that ain't what I think right all I want to be is my part of what God has revealed to me to what I'm supposed to be what about you what that's your part you know we do have an old saying that's called clean around your own house door you know maybe those on internet some of them might hear that and wonder what's going on it simply means that unless our life is straight and right we ain't got no right to be running around judging nothing else what if the world is waiting on you you know we're all getting being fast old you know and that don't mean anything because time don't have anything to do with it we can leave you tonight right no matter how young we are but don't you realize what I'm trying to say Revelation CH 4 was a foundation a preparation to be able just understand the first verse of chapter 5 right because because it's a total repeat of verse four of verse two of chapter 4 you saw a throne in one city on the throne but then you see the book in his hand now what kind of a book is that well I've heard preachers preach and I agree with you to agree say it's the Bible I agreed to that part I've heard it preached that it was a list of names and all our names was there I'll agree with that to a part see but I thought it was a revelation of Jesus Christ and where he was at and what he was doing you remember that qu that quotation the other night and it's not brother R said it's not just the revelation of Jesus Christ he said this where he's at and what he's doing cuz he's not here physically but you're in the bride of Christ right now you remember the last statements we were making on chapter 4 and then we started in on Sunday afternoon and gave those quotes where the prophet of God said that he'll take the book climb up on the throne and sit down have we provided him a throne to be able to S him have we provided a book that can be in his hand what about simple question if this book is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what your Prophet said it was then what is your revelation you know somebody might ask you one of these days what's your Revelation right I remember right here years ago somebody brother asked brother Dixon he said you believe that he said explain it to me he put him on the spot that's right and he said you don't have to give me quotes to explain he said just put it in your own language right what about it it's all we got is quotes brother R said this brother R said that or is it a revelation so if it's a revelation we can depend upon God providing or preparing a place so that's what the Bible says right I go to prepare a place for you if I go to prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you under myself right it's in our hearts and lives right here on Earth right you said well you you're preaching it's that it's up in heaven no I don't know where you got that idea cuz we ain't went to the Rapture yet I kept emphasizing that we ain't left the world yet so evidently it must not be matching what's here of what's that right right when it matches we'll go or we'll go by the grave before then come on Brothers what if the world is waiting on you would your Revelation produce a throne for him to sit on y your Revelation bring into manifestation the throne that God could set on would he be pleased to dwell what about of preparing for the opening of The Seven Seals so then if we don't get to preparation remember when we had the first quote brother re said we got to get the preparation right we don't get to preparation right if I was you I would go read the breach and I would read it and just see what the breach says about what being prepared cuz you might find out as something personal to you we want to blame everybody else right no can't be done what we got 136 in the spiral book Old Time power amen they were in the upper chamber they were all wonderful when the Holy Ghost descended as promised by our the the the about it are you getting your part ready this is not a group therapy this is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to every individual in a church the first of revelation of Jesus Christ to you were in the when we all get right in the throne will be now andap everyone see if you like Revelation what the Propet say was to this is sister want pray about her it's up to her I can pray with her about her family she can pray with me about my a personal point the your own family you know your family to way sure we one baptize everyone and power GI to our father for us 139 it's not just for everybody it's it's for you you and I you go home with nothing else of the message tonight you remember the world waiting on you and God waiting on you and I
