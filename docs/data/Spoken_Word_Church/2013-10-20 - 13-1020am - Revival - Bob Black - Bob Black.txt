========================================
and to see you shining in the light of your glory to power and love love see lifted up pour out your power and love sing Holy Holy Holy hope holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen and you can't see him without Holiness it says Ephesians Paul and Ephesians and uh let's go ahead and um turn to Matthew chapter 13. this brother Dale talking about all the the healings and the Miracles we just seen God move so much lately and uh you know last Sunday Zach was uh he was laying in the car between the services and uh just he was like Daddy I just want to go home and and um you know sometimes the devil will do stuff like that to you to let's let's let's go on and forsake This sinling Together of ourselves and and uh but you know I I lay my hands on him and prayed for him a little bit he come on in the church and he felt a little bit better and then after the service he uh he came up and brother Dale prayed for him and he said after the afternoon that afternoon he said I I feel I'm completely delivered that uh God just raised him up and okay God is able God is in our midst he's still the same yesterday today and forever so uh this morning I um you know uh I before I start talking I just you know sometimes the devil will come and talk to you before you minister or whatever and and uh you know I just want to free myself up a little bit he'll say you know you can't you you know uh you you can't bring anything new or something to this church or whatever and that's not my intent because what I don't want to bring anything new or anything anything new that you hadn't heard anymore it's the same old gospel the same old message and you know if if I just go for 30 minutes or or until 12 o'clock you know let's just uh just uh just give me liberty to just relax a little bit and and uh you know if it's not as long maybe as you think it should be then uh praise the Lord anyhow so um I just want to relax myself a little bit so that the Lord can move maybe and uh now let's just read in Matthew chapter 13. uh verse 3 and then we'll skip on down to verse 24 and 25 and then go over to First Kings chapter 17 Matthew 13 verse 3. and he spoke many parables unto them in Parables many things unto them in Parable saying behold A sower went forth to sow and over in in the 24th verse another Parable put him forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened into a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way and now let's go over to First Kings chapter 17. um verse 22 and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we thank you God for your grace to us and for your presence here Among Us this morning Lord and we thank you Lord God for making yourself a manifest in our midst Lord Jesus and Lord God as we open your word this morning Lord I pray Lord that you will open it to our hearts Lord Jesus and minister to us Lord if anyone's come this morning Lord Jesus are seeking a touch from you Lord I pray that they'll be touched Lord just like the woman Lord that had a an issue in her Lord Jesus that desire that touched from you Lord Jesus I pray God that maybe Lord something will be said this morning to help and not to hinder Lord God and Lord you just have the preeminence this morning Lord we ask it in your name that shall be among us Lord bless the reading of your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated now keep in mind these two scriptures that a civil war went forth to sow down a little bit okay just alert me if you can't hear me right place I need water A sower went forth to sow and over in First Kings chapter 17 verse 22 and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and I I want to speak this morning on maybe a strange topic because um you know one this this topic came to me one day when I was walking to work when going to work one morning and I was uh when I sit on the bus or or ride the the subway I'll sit there and just listen to the look to Elijah in in my earpiece and I or I'll read the Bible on the train and and that's just a nice little hour of meditation where that I can spend studying on the the Lord and thinking on meditating on the word and um you know sometimes when I get off the train um you know I walk into the office and I have maybe a five minute or ten minute walk and then uh the the the word has been sown and then the spirit will just come down and Quicken it so you know not every time but but sometimes it doesn't and um I I'm not saying this to make nothing of myself you know that but um I'm just saying this as a uh as an illustration that um this is uh foreign one morning I was walking in uh into work after I had been listening to the Lord and just the spirit of the Lord fell in such a way that uh you know maybe it just kind of maybe more rare than it should be and uh something happened that I'll leave toward the end of this message to share it with you but uh you know just the power of God came down in such a way and it just began to reveal his word and because first the word must be sown into your heart and then that makes a way for the spirit to come and make bring it to life and make it manifest and I I got to thinking what makes what constitutes a Revival and you know many times we'll look and we'll we'll uh maybe get the wrong idea in our head we'll think maybe if the musicians have just uh uh forgive me but get their act together a way to say maybe if they would just play a little more pumped up music or something or or do something a little bit different or maybe if the preach sure would swear a little bit more or maybe uh if he would um uh just all these things in our mind we have our own mental conception of how it should work and how it should be laid out for a Revival to come and I I was thinking years ago I was in a I was in a um a church service and this church service you know sometimes you you you come to church and maybe you think this was at another church now I just want to point that out but uh the um the the the preacher was preaching on something you think well we've heard this so many times before and you look across the congregation and there was people on the front row asleep and everybody was so tired and and everybody it seemed like everybody had heard that before and you think well you know how can how can a Revival come from this and it at the end of the service a little young person sprung up in this tears streaming down their face and they went up to the Altar and gave their heart to the Lord and fell down at the altar you think you you we picked you in our mind what a Revival is that a Revival has got to be something that'll pump you up and and uh and just you know all the musicians excited everybody's excited people standing up during the whole service but let's find out what a Revival really is and and now keep these two scripts a lot of times when the minister to read the scriptures that you forget the scriptures halfway through this I don't want you to forget the scriptures this morning that Matthew 13 13 3. A sower went forth to sow and First Kings chapter 17 verse 22 and you know and this day I I was looking around I think it worked a lot a lot of times I read this article about how people HD it was kind of it was supposed to be a motivational thing about how you in this day and time a lot of people the CEO and the CTO and everybody at work they um they're Faking It is what this article was saying is they don't really know what they're doing and I you know if You observe at work I get in these little conference rooms and and and you can see people come in with their presentations and whatnot what should we buy this software or should we buy that and the people making the decisions really don't know they're faking it they're just trying to they're trying to put on something that like they know what's going on but really they're faking it and you know we were faking it until God sent us Elijah to show us the truth to show us the real the real message and now I want to take a look at First Kings chapter 17 because you know before a revival can come you know brother Dale's been preaching on uh how God predestinates by our desire not his desire and you know Matthew Henry says something real real interesting he I wrote it down in my little scratchy right unless Lord will not be able to read it when God intends great Mercy for his people the first thing he does is set them a Praying because they desire to see something they have a desire in their heart in their life for something to happen now some people pray for God to make a move in their Church make a move for an individual but uh you know this person particular person in First Kings chapter 17 that we're going to look at prayed for something in herself and you know um ah and this first Kings chapter 17 just Elijah comes on the scene all of a sudden and maybe the the place and the time that he appeared mirrors maybe a little bit the the place and the time of today because Israel was a lot like America that they had found it they they supposedly had founded uh not supposedly they had they they had founded uh the whole nation was founded on God on on the on on today we would say on on our Christian principles and they had left those Christian principles behind and Ahab had set himself an example for all the other people in the nation as the head of the state the head of the church and whatnot he had married himself to that Jezebel religion and all of the priests began to follow him and and uh instead of staying with the with the written word with God's word they went off into that uh idolatry adulterous system and they forsue God's word and I I want to impress upon you today that no matter you know I see a lot of times the preacher from behind the pulpit will say something about marriage and divorce or whatever and then you go home and your mom and daddy will say something contrary it'll be all right if you kiss somebody it'll be all right if you Court it'll be all right but God's word is the standard that we live by I don't care who it is it says it if it's contrary to God's word I don't say I don't care whether even if I say something contrary because Paul said if an angel from heaven brings says anything contrary to by my word don't don't don't listen to him but God's word is the standard the measurement that we live by and they they went aside from God's standard they took uh they took Satan's lives just like in the Garden of Eden a little bit of doubt in there mixed in and and that produced a hybrid nation and and look at this this scene where uh you know brother Branham explained that people were as this little widow woman was crying out to God people were walking down the streets with their wine casts and their just in complete chaos and they uh the uh the the same kind of situation that we have today maybe not maybe don't look at it so much in America but what about the message where the thing the people that should be the most holy the most Sanctified for God are leaving the word or leaving the true word or the hour and and and maybe her heart in that day cried out for a Revival that something where when everybody else it looked like had left the true word but she had something in her heart crying out and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hints and turn the Eastward and hide thyself by the Brookshire wrist that is before Jordan let me skip on down the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to Zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to Zarephath now what it doesn't say in the Bible and what brother Branham illuminates because the prophet can tear open the word like that great eagle and reveal the Hidden Mysteries as he pointed out that while God spoke to Elijah he also spoke to the widow woman and told her to go out and pick up two little sticks and bring them together because her now that's predestination God moving things in line and moving things into order so so that you could hear the word and so that your desire could be made and manifest because she desired to hear the word she desired maybe she didn't even know what she was really Desiring but something just inside her was was crying out as a heart pan for the water Brook and I I was thinking back to um when when we right after my wife and I got married I I spent uh you know I didn't even know what I was searching for and I had a little brother uh tell me you need to find a church and I I laid on my knees and on my face for two weeks and I you know something something so strong and so great was laid on my heart that I needed to move from where I was in South Carolina and uh I I called out to God I don't know where to go I don't know what to do and uh you know there was a little person that said well there's you can come to our church and I think uh maybe uh and you know I didn't even really know what I was after and but you know God is so great to give us the desires of our heart just like you know the same thing happened to Cornelius in the Bible where he he he fell down and fasted and prayed for hours that God would send him the word that God would send him send him somebody that knew what they were talking about and and he sent him straight to Peter and Before Peter got there God showed Peter that he was coming by vision and just like this little woman and uh this little widow woman that God put the ends together he put everything together and uh just God works it out so marvelously uh so he arose and went to Zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink and you know that's a theme that's repeated often often in the Bible over and over is before you get something from God you've got to give something Isaac and Rebecca before when when the messenger came to Rebecca the sign was that she would volunteer to go water his camels she volunteered to do it I'll I'll go above and beyond more than what whatever it takes whatever it takes Lord I'll do it and and so This Woman This with a woman and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I am not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel he told her bring me I pray the immersive bread in thine hand and she said I had I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die so she took those two little sticks to cross um she took the two little sticks to cross and she took the word and she quickened it with the spirit just like on my way from the subway the word had been sown and the Spirit came and quickened it and after the spirit comes and quickens that word then you got something you can hang on to you got something that can't be shaken and you know that that word had to be crushed without by that pestle because he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him by his stripes we are healed and you can rest upon that if you need healing if you need salvation if you need anything you can rest upon God's word being just hang on that now and Elijah said under a fear not go and do as our sin but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy sin for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did he many days because after the Revival comes it doesn't last right right just until the next day or just until the next week but it's something permanent it's something that that never ends it never fails a Revival is for a real revivalist forever and ever for Eternal and she went and did according to the sayings of Elijah and the barrel of middleweights did not and and then now the scripture that I'm getting to and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the Mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him and that's how God a lot of times after after He blesses you after he fills you with the Holy Ghost after the River Jordan then comes the trial then God's going to see What You're Made Of what's in there and and that's what he was doing to the little widow woman to see what's see what's going to happen and she said unto Elijah what have I had to do with the old thou man of God all Thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son I remember somebody came up to what I was afraid when they came before The Prophet all of my sins are going to be remembered all the things that I've done but he said I can't once it's under the blood I can't see it no more it's gone I can't see it and he said unto her give me thy son there it is again before you can get you've got to give you've got to you know before uh Moses mother got him back she had to put him in that bull rush and let that little that little basket and let him go and send him on give him over to God and then she got something back greater than she could probably ever have imagined she she probably thought something special is about this son but my goodness what he turned out to be because she gave him up give me thy sin and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he Abode and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God hast thou also brought evil upon the Widow with whom I sojourned by slaying her son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and Cried unto the Lord and he said oh Lord my God I pray thee let this child's Soul come into him again and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again amen and he revised now think about that when you're home and you put the tape in the tape player and you press play that voice of Elijah comes into your heart and it quickens something you know I don't believe in just a a one full ministry where you just listen to the prophet you know like a lot of people I was talking to another brother recently about that and that that blessed me like some people believe in a one-fold and some people believe in the fourfold but I believe in a five-fold Ministry where you get pulled Along by the ministers and you listen to the prophet at home have a complete the complete uh little little set and uh now so let's talk about down through history God has has revealed himself to his people and through the desire of the people for something has ministered himself and you know in the 1800s uh there was a man a ugly man named that they they said the ugliest man around James McCready around the 1800s and they said he was so ugly that surely he would have something good to say because he sure wasn't nothing good to look at and you know a lot of times I think how that's how maybe the gospel is sometimes maybe I I've got such a great blessing by looking at the people that brought the gospel down Through the Ages men that couldn't hardly get a word out like Smith Wigglesworth a plumber that would couldn't hardly get their uh thoughts together and uh ugly men that you think my goodness what good can come out of such an ugly face and and uh people that uh you think a Revival has got to be something that just just uh all polished up and and just everything just slicked up and right but you know a lot of times the devil's more than that and I I'm just speaking playing this morning now the James McCready lived around the time of of the the Cane Ridge Revival and Kane Ridge got his name for all the young fellas that was a man named Daniel Boone that one day was walking by this Ridge where Kane was growing and he gave it his name Cain region that over time they started a church there and then as time went on they uh man began to call upon the Lord and have a desire for God God's word to be made manifest in their midst and the Presbyterian Church actually started this they said we're gonna they sent out flyers and they said we're going to have this great move of God and and they told everybody it's going to be the greatest Revival that you've ever seen it's going to be amazing and people from thousands came from all around and they they gathered to hear the word of God brought and when they gathered there were so many people that they had sometimes seven preachers preaching at once there'd be some over here and some over there and just all going at once and Men the god began his Spirit began to make manifest among the people and you know what happened the Presbyterian Church disowned them they said uh we don't want that we wash our hands of this business we don't we're ashamed of the fire falling of the of God's move amongst the people and you know this what happened after this revival was the people they started up there was I was reading through the list of denominations that started as a result of this revival instead of of bringing the people in one Accord and and and God uh manifesting his word to individuals it what it did was it segmented them off and so that they could they they took their own ideas and took their own interpretation and created a little uh little pockets I believe a little different little denominations and I noticed one of the things they did was after the Revival and you can go there today is they built a little Monument a little building and uh you know a little historical symbol that you could go back to and say here is where the fire fell here is where it was and and I think maybe a lot of times people in the message maybe are looking for monuments you know brother Brandon when he was preaching on the the future home they people misinterpreted and thought that he was saying that you got to be within a certain circumference of the Tabernacle that you got to go to the Tabernacle and go to that particular place and as you talk to people through the message I've I've found many times that people will say if unless you go to this particular Church unless you go to this particular place because that church becomes a monument a monument of a historical event something that took place back then but God is not a God just of history but he's a god of the present he's a god he's still the same yesterday today and forever not just yesterday and then moving on up as you can see as God poured out his Spirit then people would take their own ideas and pull away and then God would pour out his Spirit again John Smith in the 1850s he's the one that would pray until he couldn't even see it The Breakfast Table he'd have to get his wife to bring him his food and he labored before the people I was reading about this uh brother uh this other brother that would he ministered to the Indians and would pry cry and pray until his eye his nose would bleed and just the great desire for God's God to move among the people and then as he as God would move then that the people would would pull away instead of being receiving a fervor to serve God they'd pull away in their own ideas and their own their own knowledge in their own way of thinking and then the Welsh Revival in 1904 to 1905 and this was a great blessing to me to just read about this and study about it because you know what happened was there's this little fella named Evan Roberts and many people don't really know why exactly how it started but Evan Roberts was one of the most influential you know he he preached more maybe than a lot of the other ministers in the Welsh Revival and I was reading where he's he was going to a little uh he was going to a seminary and one day he came up to his professor and said I've been the Lord is just leading me to go back to my church and to preach to the young people and he said well if that's what the Lord is doing he was a wise man except that if that's what the Lord is leading you to do then go back and and preach to him so he went back and you know the the the minister didn't really he hadn't quite proven little Evan Roberts and he said well Evan Roberts said I want to preach and he said well you can I tell you what you can preach uh we're gonna have a church service and at the end of it if you want to you can get up and say a few words and so the church service came and Evan Roberts got up to speak and pretty much everybody left except for 17 people and you remember in Sunday school we were looking at the number 17 and there was just 17 people left and Evan Roberts he didn't he wasn't a very eloquent man he was another person that followed in the lines of James McCready and the other ones that you didn't fit the what you would think of somebody that could that could pull on people and cause them to surrender their lives but he just he reached in his pocket and he pulled out a little sheet of paper and he said he stood before those 17 young people and he said I have a message for you from the Lord and he read these four points that I will read for you now all sin must be confessed to God and repentative number two there must be no cloud between the believer and God forgive everyone now these are all biblical biblically based he didn't just make these up you know and these are these are good points you know a lot of times brother Brian right before he preached the Seven Seals he preached Christ revealed in Simplicity because God is so great that he can get himself down to where we just it just bothers our mind how simple he can be how simple the truth can be and just a simple simple little message sometimes will uh we'll just expose our little problems and and you know all sin must be confessed to God and repentative all of it yes all of it ever ever last one there must be no cloud between the believer in God forgive everyone let nothing between and we've got nothing between you and God you can come boldly before his throne of mercy and ask ask for Grace ask for the petition that you you need as for like the little widow woman ask for the thing that God would come and and give you food on your table and and provision spiritual provision we must number three we must obey the Holy Spirit do what the spirit prompts you to do and you know there's a big one because God has given us a still small voice inside of us that so often we ignore and we won't listen to it what about you know you we think about the big things but what about the little things where you're leaving the house in the morning and you hear a still Small Voice that says get the keys or get your cell phone or or just a little small little things that uh God is God is concerned about everything from the small to the large and what about maybe when you're doing wrong when you hear that still Small Voice that ain't right you know the scripture says if they avoid even the appearance of evil if it even appears he said that Paul said that there's things that the world does that we shouldn't even talk about we shouldn't even approach to the we should keep our lives holy and Sanctified listen to that still Small Voice because Isaiah said in the latter days their car your conscience will be seared over as a hot iron don't uh if you keep uh listen you know ignore and that's still a small voice and it gets quieter and quieter there must be public confessions of Christ as Savior because Romans 10 10 Romans 10 10 says confession is made unto salvation and you know I I know this is maybe a little simple message this morning but God gave God made a confession in the beginning and he believed his own confession he said let there be light and there was light he's he's in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and he confessed out of his mouth and he believed we confessed and when you confess out of the heart of the mouth speaketh from out of the heart of the mouth speaketh and out of your own mouth comes what you believe and just like what out of God's mouth came what he was and now this little Welsh Revival started something that carried on over to Azusa Street where William Seymour was uh he heard about it and he began to preach something that I found this was really striking he was preaching that the baptism in the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues if you look back through history at that point in time they believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost was sanctification and they uh everybody was was preaching just live a holy life and maybe today many times maybe we kind of get in the same mode as long as I'm living a holy life as long as I can feel the presence of the Lord as long as I can like in the the apostles you know they they were casting out devils and and uh believing in signs following just at sanctification and you think well just like they did well this is it this is the end of the road but Along Came William seabour and he was preaching something that he had never even experienced he had never experienced speaking in tongues and he went to this little church in in Los Angeles and and he started when they found out he was preaching something that they had never experienced they kicked him out and and put him on his road until one day he experienced it now you know you know it took a real Prophet to come along and show us real what the real evidence of the Holy Ghost was uh you know God Winks at our ignorance a lot of times but uh I I want to take a step back before I get in to this you know just think about this now God he the word is heard and the word is sown this the rain falls quickens it and it begins to grow and grow and all after all these revivals the the the word had been sown and they they pulled aside they pulled aside into their own knowledge their own ideas and hybrid it with their own wisdom and when the rain fell the let's see what's there it it produced death It produced something that went away from God's God's word now you uh there there's a something that's repeated through the scripture is that when God moves now this goes for receiving the Holy Ghost and down through the different uh the um manifestations of God's spirit as he moved through the different um through the different ages and things but when when God's spirit moves the believer has to keep moving along with it as it was the light moves you should stay right with that with the spirit moves and you know what provokes movement is a little group of people God's movers I believe that's what the five-fold ministry is to get in there and and keep you moving don't sit still is to provoke you John Wesley said the fivefold ministry is to provoke one another to jealousy to provoke you to want to be closer to God to provoke you to want to be closer to him and not just to sit still and get uh uh let all the the The Vines and things of of uh your own knowledge and of the world and your own wisdom encroach in but to keep moving with God and you know uh there was a people that who lived in the Middle East when that wanted desire to to find God and one day they saw a star and they just kept moving with that star and they followed it until one day it led them right to the word what they were searching for and God God will God's word will do that for us today if we'll just stay with it and follow it now I want to just kind of think what is a Revival what is what what would a Revival have looked like in the Old Testament and one of my favorite stories is um the story of Cain and Abel this was the you know the first Sunday School less than I ever taught was on this little story of Cain and Abel and I got to thinking what what would happen if Cain and Abel were alive today what were they what were their their demeanor be like what were they act like that's that's something to think upon what were they um how they behave how what would their reaction be to God's word and you know Cain and Abel both came from in Genesis 4 the story tells us that they both were desirous to serve God because they both God had given them a special gift he had given them something that animals don't have he had given them a soul I remember I remember they they uh when I was in grade school they passed out this little thing that talked about this I don't know if you remember Coco the gorilla they taught Coco how to talk and she had she could do sign language and answer questions and they they one day they asked Coco uh they were asking her all kind of questions what kind of food do you like best I like oranges and different things and they said well is there a god that's an interesting question to ask an animal and Coco the gorilla responded I don't know anything about God I don't know any I don't know what that is and a lot of people might look I think I thought back then when I was just a little kid that they were using that little article see there there's proof and we've asked an animal and this animal should know better than a human being with a soul whether there's a God or not but God there's the difference between an animal and a human is it a human has something that can reach out to God and and connect something with inside a deep calling to the deep and when there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond there's got to be out there somewhere so they both had something calling but Cain was anointed with a spirit now look at Cain's daddy now I was looking at the word what subtle means because the Bible says that the Beast was more subtle than all the creatures and you know there's a there's a a lot of different definitions but subtle means that you take what it really means is you you well like a dog you just tell a dog to see it and it says or or you can teach a parrot to fly from one place to the other but something that's subtle can understand the subtle differences if you if you say well you know go pick me some corn or whatever they can understand and that Beast was subtle it could pick up you know it could it understood that little fine nuances of human speech and what what does subtle mean today it means people that will nitpick and and and try to find fault and try to find a little way that they can weasel in their own little idea and figure out a way to get in like like what happened in the Garden of Eden the Beast that said that just took one word out and squeezed one word in by the influence of Satan now so Cain he had that same Spirit on him he got that same he was along that same line and he he was inclined to try to get his own idea in there instead of taking God's word he had no interest in God's word at all no interest in keeping the Bible and I remember when uh brother Branham said this real simple thing that applies to them you know at his first pool he said the angel told him if you can just get the people to believe you if faith comes by hearing the word and Abel heard the word and he believed it and where did he hear the word from he had he heard the word from first from his mama and daddy as they sat down and and they talked to him uh and I was reading where brother Randolph said they talked to him about what had happened in the garden you know I'm sure you had many questions and he said he may be well you know brother Brown said why he wanted to know why we got cast out of the Garden of Eden why what happened and he mm-hmm he was interested in hearing all about the reasons why and brother Adam said they told him they didn't tell him all the truth they said it was an apple just like today the church has been told that it's an apple but you know I I wonder if maybe he picked up here and there are little details like God clothed us with with lamb skin he killed something that and a blood atonement was made and he covered us with it said something maybe one day he was looking out of the star sitting out there with God and just looking up at the universe and looking at that great Bible that God had rode in Heavens and he thought there's got to be maybe just God just quickened in his eye in his in his heart something about where he came from and where he's going and that'll spark a revelation when you see the problem when you see you've got to be saved and see and you can see the remedy that able to look forward and down through time and saw that uh that one day a lamb would be slain as a sacrifice for us to take away take our sins upon himself and he believed it and he held on by faith and you know this this road that Abel was on applies to everything from salvation to getting filled the Holy Ghost to Healing if you receive if you need healing just hang on I remember uh I remember so many things growing up I remember when my um my brother one time was sick to death in the hospital and my my dad and my family just held on believe that doctors didn't know what was going on what was wrong and they just held on and believed until God brought a miracle to pass I remember years ago that my wife the devil was trick her with with uh something horrible and we just held on until one day uh the a mighty rushing wind came through the window and she was delivered and if you just hold on and that's what Acts 2 38 is all about they were they were up in the upper room and they were holding on to God's word he told us to come up here and wait until we're indeed with power from on high and I believe that you know God Abel saws he got a revelation from God he didn't just get something that was in his own mind like King God he he believed that he he didn't wait for a revelation from God he he instead of bringing an offering by Revelation he brought something that he worked up and he brought the fruits of the field but Cain but Abel had a revelation and when you have a real Revelation then it it began as a desire in you to serve God now Abel's Revelation was brought by the word being made manifest the word that God quickened and he quickened he quickened in his life and began to make it manifest and that brought justification that brings justification today now sanctification is brought the same way you hear the word and it quickens in you a desire to serve God and I I remember I'm talking about a Revival what brings a Revival what brings a desire to serve God more in your life what brings a desire to want to glorify him in your flesh to see him glorified and we were talking in Sunday school about sanctification and just being Holiness and God requires God will never be pleased outside of a Sanctified life and we read in Ephesians how you before you can see God before before you can really before you could enter the holy of holies that that the Old Testament priest had to be Sanctified they had to have everything in orderly order they had to have everything just so and if they didn't they had that long rope that trailed outside of the holy of holies that they would be the the high priest would and he would be dragged out because if if he didn't have everything just perfectly lined up and we read it we read in in Sunday School in Malachi chapter three it talks about the the the Forerunner to to the to the one whom you seek that will quickly come to his Temple how that he would prepare the way of the Lord because the way had to be made straight everything had to be made ready for the one that the one that they saw to come to the temple and when he finally came to the temple what he found was that there they weren't ready they weren't prepared they they had not heard the message of the day they hadn't heard what had been preached and when he got to the temple they instead of living Sanctified holy lives they were living they were Desiring after money and things of this world and so we did the only thing he could because God his design can't be broken before the word could come to the temple it had to be purified so he took his whip up and beat him out and I was thinking you know just think about the approach that God takes a lot of times when you discipline your kids is it is it to drive them away from you or is it to drive them to you and and my wife and I a lot of times you know when we spank our kids my wife spanks the kids and and then they'll come running to me or I'll spank the kids and they'll go running to her but we always we try to put us put a stop to that because that's not what discipline is about that's not what weapons are about is you give the whooping you give the loving because God when God whips us it's not to drive us away from him it's to drive us to him he gives us a whooping and we come back to him God forgive me of what I've done God forgive me I've done wrong and he he's drawing us to him that's what he was trying to do I believe when he whipped him out of the temple he wasn't trying to drive him away from himself but he was trying to get them to serve God he was trying to put something in them you're not doing it right and you know if you whip your kids in Anger you're not doing it right if you drive them away from you you're not if you don't don't do it in love you're not doing it right and down through this whole journey of Cain and Abel from justification sanctification it was driven just like the the widow woman's journey by their desire Abel's desire and Cain didn't have a desire for the word but Abel did Abel had a desire whatever it takes Lord if you'll reveal yourself to me then I'll I'll whatever it takes and so we took up by Revelation he took up that bleeding lamb and he began to drag it down to the sacrifice and you know the word made manifest in your life always produces separation it always you know when Abel took up that little lamb and started dragging him and Kane looked over there and said what are you doing Abel what what kind of a messy business is this I'm I'm sure that created quite a separation and God's God's word made manifest in your life always creates a separation because it breeds an atmosphere real Holiness creates an atmosphere and you create if you if your home is Holy then you have a different kind of atmosphere you'll have an atmosphere where you know I believe a a real message of believer in families home has the tapes playing have that Bible open up on your just a Bible open up on the dresser creates a different atmosphere you know if you look down at the beginning of the creation God God type when God the brother said first the world was in darkness and then he God said let there be light and that light that brother Branham said was the word that went forth and you know a lot of people look at look at those the days of creation and they'll say why did light come forth on the first day but the Sun and the Moon weren't put in the heavens until the fourth day that's so odd but now you look at it and the it almost mirrors your journey because you were in darkness groping in darkness groping at things of the world and then God's word Shone on you and then on the second day what happened the the word had Shone on the earth and it created a separation he took the firmament and he separated he pulled it apart and put the atmosphere in the heaven and put the water over the Earth and then that atmosphere what did it be get it beget life and after the the light of the word shown on the earth and that that atmosphere came over the earth and the the the the moisture and things then the the third day the the season that were in the earth began to come forth if you create an atmosphere in your home around God's word and the atmosphere is attitude your attitude to God's word if you get in the right attitude your emotions and objectives aligned up right with God's word it'll break see God's word brick come to pass and see see things change in your home and in your life life if you just surround yourself read the Bible in the morning and pray and create an atmosphere of worship see God's word may come to pass and I was thinking about how you know when Jesus came to the temple he wasn't very timid but the Holy Ghost is timid the Holy Ghost is timid and and that Holy your holy life you got to live holy so that you can see God because the Holy Ghost when you do brother I've said even when you go a little bit over the speed limit then that Holy Spirit that will just go like up on a limb because he's timid he don't want to stay around unbelief and doing wrong and things and create that atmosphere where the Holy Spirit feels welcome and can come into your home and you brother Brown preached the sermon doors and a door where you know he talked about not having one door of your heart shut off to him well what about the doors of your home where you got your kids shut up in the room somewhere doing who knows what and and can't have don't have enough assumption to go up and say you can't live like this kids you can't you can't do this uh you know we're not the holy the holy life requires us to have a little backbone with our with our families and with our uh you know let me just stop there you know Luke 175 says we shouldn't a sanctification in the Holy life isn't just a phase of your life right before you get the Holy Ghost but it's something that you live for the rest of your days Luke said Holiness and righteousness all the days of your life and when you're holy I can't believe it I'm running out of time oh when when when able when they were brought that sacrifice to the altar brother Brown said full obedience entitles you to the Token full obedience entitles you to everything that God's word has allowed and so he there was actually a lot of quotes I was going to read but um full obedience and so Abel brought his sacrifice to the altar and laid it on the Altar and you know when you get to the to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to complete the new birth you know a lot of people look at you you begin to pull things out of scripture and and like brother Branham did where is that what where does it say what the seventh seal is where does it say how God received Abel's sacrifice where does it say that Abraham and Sarah were turned back but it does say it but the only way that you can know you can understand because you know he that heareth and believeth on him that sent me Jesus said he that heareth the word is sown and then not just believes not just say I believe it but to understand that is the evidence to understand God's word to have it revealed in you to have it be brought to life just like on the third day and now Abel came to that to the to the Altar and Cain was looking on and and maybe like just like in the the upper room they were wondering what's going to happen What what will be the evidence of the sacrifice being accepted what will be the fruit How Will I Know will it just be well I've done it I put the lamb up on the altar enough and it's there but maybe Abel waited a little bit like you know Elijah wasn't scared when he put He told him to put water all around the altar with that sacrifice and he he challenged them you know let your your Gods come over here and and uh do whatever you want to do hack on yourselves beat yourselves whatever it takes whatever you feel is necessary but you know when you come according to God's plan when you know God's plan and purpose you can rest on it and have faith that you have done everything that's required not just wait wait for healing to be made manifest wait for his promises to come to fruit and so Abel sat and watched and waited and Cane washed and waited and something happened that came does it still doesn't understand to this day that the fire fell because brother Branham said that he that God Vindicated Abel's Sacrifice by consuming it and we know that because he's Hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever and he does it one if he does something one way he'll do it that way forever and ever and you know one day he's going to purge this Earth by a holy fire and wipe out all the sin and everything from it just like he does in the Believers heart that by a holy consuming fire he comes rolling through and cleans out everything that shouldn't be there and leaves behind the statue of a perfect man come rolling through and leaves virtue and knowledge and Temperance and leaves his Holiness behind you and his godliness and I believe you know brother brand I've talked about how a a tree when when the leaves come up on it you don't say well there's you look for an Evidence in the in the the fall this time of year is the trees the leaves are falling off the off the off of the trees there's going to be a new life that comes up in that tree next year just to create an illustration and when when the believer gets filled with the Holy Ghost a new life comes up that's an everlasting Revival something that that you can't fake and I look at Cain and Abel one was faking it one was trying to go in on their own knowledge and on their on their own understanding on their own ideas and the other was going in on Revelation oh I mean let me see what quote I was going to read let's read oh my actually let me just go ahead and finish up I'm I'm not even going to get close to some of these but um you know God God told a and the word is told about the the five wise and the five foolish virgins and and they uh what the difference was between them was one held on to their own ideas and they owned denominational ideas and their denominational creeds uh the musicians can go ahead and come forward and the uh the wise the wise and the fullest the wise took God at his word and waited for Revelation and let that seed be sold in their heart and let the Spirit come and Quicken it now just to finish up what what I was going when I was walking to the to work from the Train you know the spirit the spirit of the Lord fell on me the word had been sold in my heart and the spirit fell on me and and I was walking along just under the power and the anointing of the Holy Spirit as his word was revealed and something strange happened I I I turned the corner this was real early in the morning and I turned the corner and there was nobody else on the street I was walking next to the Federal Reserve building they got their big arm guard with the security guards with their machine guns and and bomb sniffing dogs and I turned the corner and there was nobody else on the street but just as I turned somebody else stepped in front of me this uh this woman that was you know dressed like the world and uh she was listening to something on her Walkman and the spirit of the Lord was all over the place just quickening that word and now you all know I'm not saying this to make myself anything God forbid but the spirit was right there and she began to raise up her arms and shout and glorify God and she began to praise God and I thought what a strange situation this is now I'm walking down the street and I just heard the prophet I've just heard Elijah and the words being quickened to me and now this woman that maybe she doesn't even know what's going on but for some reason she got in that presence and she began to glorify God and now I think there's the real difference between Cain and Abel today one uh just it's not just get in the presence there's the difference between a real a real Revival not just get in the presence and get in the spirit and and Shout a little bit and then go home back to your old ways your own your your thinking and but but to let God's word take root in you like that sword that went forth to sow that brother Branham you know he saw that vision of the two Shores that the Earth was all tilled up and one went out sowing good seed and the other bad seed but to let that good seed take root in you and bring forth life and then you've got a fire that's Kindle in you that will never die and um I had a lot of quotes let's let's just stand real quick and I I just want to say a word of prayer as just before I turn it back over to brother Dale uh is if there's anyone that has a need if you just raise your hand if you just want a touch like like a able with that fire something to just vindicate and give you a little touch from the Lord just raise your hand as we go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus I thank you God today for your presence Lord I know this message was all chopped up and Lord I just went all different kind of places Lord but maybe Lord you can put it straighten it out into people's minds and Lord Jesus that a real true Revival is not built on emotions it's not built on something that we our own knowledge or our own intellect our own wisdom but it's built upon the revealed word Made Alive in our hearts Lord Jesus Lord God every uplifted hand Lord Jesus I pray that you'll touch them Lord and reach out Lord God and make your word manifest in them Lord Jesus and help them Lord of God Lord my desires it'll not be one person leave today this hasn't been touched from you Lord Jesus Lord God granted I pray Lord that you'll be with brother Aaron this afternoon and be with all the ones that we requested prayer for this morning Lord Jesus because we know that you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're still the same
