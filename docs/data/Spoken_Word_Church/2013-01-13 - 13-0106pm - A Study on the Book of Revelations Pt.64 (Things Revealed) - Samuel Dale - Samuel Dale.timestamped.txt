[3:54] we can depend on the fact of what you
[3:56] say
[3:58] that we
[3:59] can lay our life upon it
[4:01] and not have to worry
[4:03] we pray this afternoon that you would
[4:04] just come and speak to us and give us
[4:06] some understanding years that we may
[4:08] hear
[4:09] what you're trying to say
[4:11] because lord we know that it's got to be
[4:13] revealed to us
[4:15] we need that more than anything head
[4:17] knowledge is wonderful
[4:19] must be there in preparation
[4:22] getting ready but we need a revelation
[4:25] lord just have your way and guide us now
[4:28] as we read your word you come and speak
[4:30] to our hearts forgive our sins
[4:32] cleanse us of all unrighteousness and
[4:34] keep us in your love
[4:36] in jesus name
[4:38] amen
[4:41] revelations 1
[4:45] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[4:47] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[4:49] things which must shortly
[4:50] come to pass and he sent and signified
[4:52] it by his angel and to his servant john
[4:55] to our record of the word of god and the
[4:57] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[4:59] things that he saw
[5:01] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[5:03] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[5:06] those things which are written therein
[5:08] what for the time is at hand the time to
[5:11] understand
[5:13] is at hand
[5:15] revelations 8 1
[5:17] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[5:18] there was solace in heaven about the
[5:20] space of hyphen hour
[5:22] so that's just what we've got you may be
[5:24] seated so we deal with that
[5:27] as to understand right
[5:31] it may be
[5:32] a little hot now you may have to turn
[5:34] the fans on this afternoon
[5:36] to keep it because we still don't have
[5:38] the ending working until we can get
[5:40] everything fixed up
[5:43] but we'll do the best we can so that way
[5:45] you
[5:46] you know
[5:47] you just this morning getting set close
[5:49] quick stay warm to see you have to move
[5:51] over to a little family or something i
[5:53] want this to change in the service a
[5:54] minute
[5:56] now
[5:58] what was the main thought we were trying
[6:00] to bring this morning
[6:02] is the thought that we have been
[6:03] bringing down through all of the seals
[6:07] that
[6:10] we had to have a profit
[6:13] to be able to tell these things
[6:16] now
[6:18] i say that really we had to have a
[6:20] prophet to tell us the whole bible
[6:22] right now there was been maybe some
[6:24] things we had lined up and things like
[6:26] that because of
[6:28] of the bible and the ability to to read
[6:31] and the the understanding and all but
[6:35] the our whole dependence upon is upon
[6:38] where whether god sent a prophet
[6:41] all right and we believe he did to bring
[6:43] us the word of god and to reveal that
[6:46] word unto us and then coming down
[6:49] through the seals we know that
[6:51] we saw this morning and we've studied it
[6:53] over and over that
[6:55] there is no combat beast after you come
[6:58] to the fourth seal
[7:00] because that fourth combat beast is an
[7:02] eagle which is a prophet promised of god
[7:05] to come
[7:06] and as it comes in that way we have the
[7:09] ability to receive
[7:12] uh from things that even are not in
[7:14] in symbols right
[7:17] all right because the fifth c06 seal was
[7:19] not a symbol
[7:21] it was a reality or people
[7:23] so we needed someone to be able to tell
[7:25] us who that was or what it is
[7:28] and things coming down
[7:31] and then coming to the seventh seal we
[7:33] would use the same
[7:35] uh
[7:36] layout or thought you know
[7:38] that
[7:40] we must put our total dependence upon
[7:42] god to keep his word
[7:44] and bring us the
[7:46] revelation you know of that
[7:49] seventh seal because it says silence in
[7:51] heaven
[7:52] with a space of half an hour right as i
[7:55] said and i do it for others out there on
[7:57] the internet there's a lot of people
[7:58] trying to figure out what time it was
[8:00] how much time
[8:02] uh 21
[8:04] days or 21 years or just out of the
[8:07] other but
[8:08] why don't you just turn it around like
[8:09] it's supposed to be it's silence in
[8:11] heaven it didn't say anything about
[8:12] earth
[8:14] you know so how long would silence in
[8:16] heaven be
[8:17] silence in heaven could be 5 000 years
[8:20] in order to be a moon not a thing
[8:22] because they're not dealing with like
[8:24] you and i wearing out because we're
[8:26] standing
[8:27] right
[8:28] it's a totally different situation so
[8:31] then why worry about
[8:33] the time element of it
[8:35] the getting ready now we uh brought that
[8:38] this morning and i
[8:40] kind of changed the title just a little
[8:41] bit
[8:42] and then bringing it in you know
[8:45] of things being revealed
[8:47] and uh
[8:48] now we want to talk about the things
[8:50] that are revealed
[8:52] on the seventh seal
[8:54] it's all is not his name revealed
[8:59] well
[9:01] it says silence in heaven
[9:05] what if we had a prophet to tell us what
[9:07] that was
[9:09] see my point of what i was bringing this
[9:11] morning the reason i got into that i
[9:12] didn't think i'd spend that long i was
[9:14] just going to try to emphasize a little
[9:17] because you see church
[9:19] there were silence under the first seal
[9:21] because we didn't know what that was
[9:22] right
[9:24] the second seal as far as reaping
[9:26] silence to you and i until we know what
[9:28] it is
[9:30] you know i mean you can read it while
[9:31] it's writer but what's the difference if
[9:33] you don't know what that is it's a
[9:35] sealed up mystery
[9:36] it's a silence
[9:38] but see when the prophet come and told
[9:40] us what those symbols were
[9:44] then we could understand at least the
[9:46] symbols of it
[9:48] but we still must have it revealed to us
[9:51] that's right
[9:53] what do you mean that is that's a
[9:55] relevancy that's what people think
[9:57] well you could read it before the
[9:59] prophet came
[10:00] that's right
[10:04] why wouldn't it revelation then
[10:07] right right
[10:08] but see then coming down to the seventh
[10:10] seal
[10:11] then we have to have the dependence upon
[10:15] the fact that god sent a prophet amen
[10:19] and there were some things revealed
[10:21] under this seventh seal as we'll get to
[10:23] it a minute where the prophet said
[10:25] this is my revelation
[10:28] that's the same thing he said about the
[10:30] first seal second seal third fourth
[10:32] fifth sixth
[10:34] this is my revelation he certainly
[10:36] wasn't dependent upon an organized
[10:38] religion revelation or anybody else
[10:41] he said he had to stand along on what he
[10:43] believed well
[10:44] you know
[10:45] if you're a true christian you will
[10:47] really walk alone that's right there's a
[10:49] lot of other people walking along too
[10:51] you know it's not just one thing but
[10:54] still in god it's you and god as a
[10:56] person together right it's not you and
[10:58] god in triple person two three or four
[11:00] more persons
[11:01] he's revealing himself to you and you
[11:03] only
[11:04] that's the way you have to take the word
[11:07] then the other person has to say he's
[11:09] revealing himself to me
[11:11] and to me only because revelation is
[11:13] personal that's right
[11:15] thank god for revelation then
[11:17] that we can be able to say this is mine
[11:21] you know
[11:22] but i'm saying this is my eye
[11:25] he said god gave it to me
[11:28] amen all right so this is my revelation
[11:32] that i'm trying to preach to you
[11:34] because this is what god gave to me
[11:38] but then you have to say that's right
[11:41] you'll hear me emphasize this much more
[11:43] as we go along what is your revelation
[11:48] has god spoken to you
[11:51] are you just taking some person's word
[11:54] you know right that's it are you just
[11:56] taking a five-fold ministry person's
[11:58] word
[11:59] are you just taking brother ronald's
[12:00] word
[12:03] it must be revealed it can't be anything
[12:06] else all right
[12:08] so
[12:09] we look at the seal and see that by way
[12:12] of the prophet
[12:15] we can see what's there
[12:17] [Music]
[12:18] of what the world could not see
[12:20] and we'll never be able to see
[12:23] but now i emphasize again as i was this
[12:25] morning over and over
[12:28] what we cover from under this seventh
[12:30] seal at the prophet said that's what it
[12:32] was
[12:33] remember that cannot
[12:36] cannot be an addition to the word
[12:41] no matter what
[12:43] you can't add to the word right that's
[12:44] right
[12:46] because you add the plagues that are
[12:47] written in the book that's right
[12:49] so it's got to be in the book we read in
[12:51] a minute where the prophet said this
[12:53] seventh seal is spoken from genesis
[12:58] so if it spoke up from genesis he said
[13:00] the word that's right
[13:03] but light had not shined upon it
[13:06] to bring it out into the open that's
[13:08] right to where we could see
[13:10] right now
[13:12] when we were back in the baptist
[13:15] we would preach certain things and and
[13:17] it was true i mean you know what we
[13:19] talked about
[13:21] because we would cover like an old
[13:23] testament scripture bring it down to a
[13:25] new testament
[13:26] and see that this is fulfilled
[13:29] you know
[13:31] i remember when even being dire
[13:33] especially i was myself dealing with it
[13:35] like the coming into the gentiles
[13:38] that paul said that was a mystery
[13:40] it was mystery that was sealed back
[13:42] there in the old testament because the
[13:44] jews wasn't going to have no way in the
[13:46] world
[13:47] gentile would come into their lineage
[13:50] they would they would accept a cross of
[13:52] light they were what the word was for it
[13:56] but they would never accept it to come
[13:58] into the truth
[14:00] all right then back there we'd remember
[14:01] that hey wait a minute rahab was a
[14:03] harlot
[14:05] we didn't know she married a
[14:08] israeli general to come down but
[14:10] you had enough
[14:11] sense to read the bible and tell
[14:13] delineated to come down right you know
[14:15] to a lot of things
[14:17] but still we had to understand it
[14:20] all right that was wonderful
[14:23] and that way it's what we've got to have
[14:24] now is an understanding of god's word
[14:29] so let's follow these things that the
[14:30] prophet spoke of
[14:32] and let him be the one not us but he'll
[14:35] be the one to tell us what is under this
[14:37] seal
[14:38] well if we can stay with that
[14:40] there shouldn't be any problem with
[14:42] believing it you know
[14:44] and then try to see as we try to do with
[14:46] each seal
[14:47] is try to get us to see what is made
[14:50] known to us
[14:52] all right now this seal itself
[14:55] should be very very
[14:57] uh valuable
[14:59] into that doings
[15:02] because it is the end
[15:05] because we'll get to it in a minute
[15:07] so
[15:08] we are in the end time
[15:10] it should be more real to you and i than
[15:13] anywhere
[15:14] because we're in the end time of all
[15:16] kinds
[15:18] all right in doing that then we should
[15:20] be able to
[15:21] follow along
[15:24] and say hey that's speaking to me
[15:27] we will the lord willing
[15:28] maybe in another service or to try to
[15:30] cover some things
[15:32] that brother branham said that
[15:34] seventh seal was to him
[15:41] he said it was the tent
[15:44] he said it was the third pool
[15:49] he said it was the sword in the hand
[15:53] of those things personal to him
[15:56] all right
[15:57] well what about me and you
[16:03] it's got to be something personal to you
[16:04] and i that's right because according to
[16:07] my understanding with all that he had
[16:09] he's in the ground waiting on you and i
[16:11] bring him out
[16:12] now that's the way i believe it
[16:19] because it doesn't say the dependence
[16:21] upon him it says dependence upon you and
[16:23] i right right all right now
[16:26] with that thought let's go into what we
[16:28] were trying to do this morning
[16:30] and we'll drop over to
[16:31] number five of the notes because while
[16:34] i'm getting that up there i'll just go
[16:36] over a little bit of what we were doing
[16:38] brother said on paragraph 249
[16:42] he said it was a secret any activity in
[16:44] heaven might give away that secret
[16:46] but said it's
[16:48] it is so great it must be included
[16:52] no that's not the quote up there that
[16:53] you read
[16:56] see if i give away a secret that the
[16:57] secret there is must be included right
[17:00] because it's got to happen
[17:03] well now that's establishing
[17:07] something that's real right
[17:09] all right
[17:12] then coming on down we're only presuming
[17:14] until this seal breaks the seventh one
[17:17] remember that this morning
[17:19] that's progress 48
[17:21] and then down to paragraph
[17:24] 68 and 70.
[17:28] until this 7th seal is broken
[17:32] we're only presuming
[17:35] now to try to explain that
[17:39] is a hard thing yes
[17:41] but the best illustration i can give for
[17:43] something that
[17:44] you are presuming until it takes place
[17:47] but yet you've got to thus saith the
[17:48] lord because he had that as i said this
[17:50] morning throughout the seals he would
[17:52] say this is thus that the lord right
[17:54] then turn and say we're only presuming
[17:56] all right let me try to express it in a
[17:59] way to give us a better understanding
[18:02] there was a man named john who went to
[18:06] the isle of patmos
[18:08] and that's about 1895-96
[18:11] and he had received the holy ghost
[18:13] somewhere about
[18:14] either way you want to figure it 30 or
[18:16] 33
[18:17] somewhere you know right or whatever
[18:22] but yet he's crying for a
[18:27] lamb to come
[18:28] right
[18:30] and he knows if the lamb don't come and
[18:32] take the book
[18:34] all is lost
[18:37] now what about a man that's
[18:39] walk with the lord jesus
[18:42] you know
[18:43] three and a half years of his ministry
[18:46] going to pentecost receiving the baptism
[18:48] of the holy ghost
[18:50] placing him at the point we would look
[18:52] at the pyramid behind earth
[18:55] right under the headstone just as close
[18:57] as you could get to the coming of the
[18:59] headstone
[19:03] and yet he's crying for a deliverer
[19:05] right
[19:07] now you understand what i'm using that
[19:09] point for and if he was trying for a
[19:11] deliverer when he already knew within
[19:13] him
[19:14] and all those years he had studied god's
[19:16] word and he's chosen to go to patmos
[19:18] right but yet he's still
[19:20] there's something there that he's
[19:22] it's not finished
[19:25] you know it's not complete
[19:27] all right now that to me is the way i
[19:29] look at it when it when the prophet says
[19:32] if this seventh seal don't broke we're
[19:34] presuming
[19:36] you know right we're standing with thus
[19:39] saith the lord about the seals and the
[19:41] things
[19:42] but waiting for something to take place
[19:45] right now i hope when we get into it
[19:47] we've got enough time this afternoon
[19:49] we will get to the point that you'll see
[19:51] that it it
[19:52] there is something to take place
[19:55] that you and i are still even today
[19:57] longing for right
[20:00] all right
[20:02] i'll just go ahead and put it in here
[20:04] i'm longing for a change of this body
[20:06] amen
[20:09] and that involves
[20:12] one of the things we'll cover in a
[20:14] moment
[20:16] of the coming of the lord
[20:20] that would be involving be involved
[20:22] around that or you say
[20:24] you know
[20:25] all right
[20:26] so then that would be what we're looking
[20:28] at
[20:29] but see we're only presuming until god
[20:31] comes on the scene
[20:32] but we got to promise that he would come
[20:34] on the scene
[20:36] and break this seventh seal
[20:39] because the bible says it's open and the
[20:42] prophet 241 where we gave it this
[20:44] morning
[20:46] he says the lamb breaks it the the seal
[20:49] is broke
[20:51] well no matter what we would think about
[20:53] it not being revealed or whatever we
[20:55] think
[20:56] we should never in any form even have
[20:59] any concept of it not being broke
[21:02] that's right you know that shouldn't be
[21:04] a thought in her mind
[21:07] because the bible says it's broke the
[21:09] prophet says bro right
[21:11] didn't you go over here to this other
[21:12] quote what are you fighting quote
[21:16] i've always told you if you wait long
[21:18] enough yeah man
[21:20] they'll come together right
[21:22] right that's right but until it's
[21:23] revealed it won't come together
[21:27] all right i've had things that i wasn't
[21:29] preaching over 20 30 years
[21:31] why because i had quotes it
[21:34] was contrary
[21:36] so i must wait see you until it's to be
[21:38] made known all right then we got down
[21:40] this morning and we're right now
[21:45] he said i'm going to tell you my
[21:46] revelation of it
[21:53] he said that revelation is in a
[21:55] three-fold man
[21:57] he said i had the revelation that
[21:58] revealed
[22:00] all right
[22:02] and it's in a threefold manner
[22:04] he said i'll speak to you overfolding
[22:07] we're not worried about second third
[22:09] folk we're concerned with a fold of it
[22:13] all right
[22:14] and he said what it was it was those
[22:16] seven thunders that he hurt thunder
[22:21] now that's jumping from revelation 8 1
[22:25] revelations 10
[22:28] about two or three
[22:30] there which one spilled for the thunder
[22:33] before
[22:36] he says those thunders that he hurt
[22:38] under right
[22:42] let me say something
[22:47] we'll get to it on the message part but
[22:49] let me say something
[22:53] if it's true
[22:56] that the prophet of god
[22:59] was the voice of god for the age that
[23:01] we're living amen
[23:03] and we believe that
[23:04] right
[23:05] and if it's true that he and he only had
[23:08] the revelation
[23:11] that would reveal the word
[23:19] do you realize what we've been doing for
[23:21] 40 something years
[23:26] reading the word of god
[23:31] in a different perspective than we've
[23:33] ever read or thought about right right
[23:36] now didn't this message begin to open
[23:37] the word to us you know
[23:39] the things coming forth yes
[23:42] and in doing that
[23:45] you realize you could be hearing the
[23:46] thunders
[24:02] but if you're going to say that the
[24:03] prophet brought to revelation you
[24:05] realize when you're reading those
[24:06] messages hearing those tapes
[24:09] of the prophet
[24:10] you're actually hearing the voice of god
[24:13] right right
[24:15] which is the thunder
[24:18] hey man
[24:19] no no no no no thunder i know it
[24:22] well
[24:23] we'll get around to it maybe
[24:26] next week or something
[24:28] but
[24:31] you know where i'll be going to where
[24:33] that
[24:34] jesus
[24:36] there was a voice spoke
[24:39] and he said glorify me with the glory
[24:40] that i had to leave before the world and
[24:41] he said i've glorified thee and i'll
[24:43] glorify you again
[24:45] and the bible said that it thundered
[24:51] well you know a lot of people
[24:54] they heard boom boom boom boom
[25:01] that jesus heard a voice
[25:07] the voice said
[25:08] i'm glorified you're not glorify you
[25:10] again
[25:14] the disciples come along later on and
[25:16] maybe even after his death or whatever
[25:20] and it domes on them
[25:24] we know
[25:26] what was said on that day
[25:30] you know right
[25:32] that everybody else thought it was just
[25:34] a cloud of going over all right right
[25:36] right but we know the void everybody
[25:39] we know what we're saying
[25:44] well
[25:47] another time in the bible
[25:52] there's a man named moses
[25:55] standing at mount sinai
[25:59] and it thundered
[26:04] and they were scared to death
[26:07] but all they heard was the blue
[26:09] and you know why you're scared when it
[26:11] goes bloom bloom thunder don't kill
[26:12] nobody
[26:14] right
[26:16] but we always know that's what causes
[26:18] thunder
[26:21] you know
[26:23] lightning
[26:25] rod
[26:26] and lightning can kill that's right so
[26:29] the thunder ain't the problem right
[26:32] it really shouldn't be a problem anyway
[26:33] because when you hear the thunder
[26:35] lightning it doesn't struck you right or
[26:37] not you know
[26:38] because that's what's causing it but do
[26:40] you understand what i'm getting at
[26:43] but you know that moses heard a voice
[26:46] right
[26:48] moses dirty voice
[26:53] would it be any problem then for daniel
[26:56] right
[26:58] to have heard the thunder spread around
[26:59] himself
[27:01] i think that's the daniel said you
[27:02] wouldn't i'm pretty sure
[27:04] would it be any problem for john the
[27:07] revelator
[27:08] to be on patmos
[27:10] and hear the thunders
[27:15] and know what they said
[27:22] now you better check out something
[27:25] because it run around didn't say that
[27:27] john
[27:29] basically heard what the symbols were
[27:34] wasn't dealing with symbols
[27:35] he was writing down what the symbol was
[27:39] but then he heard
[27:41] the thunders
[27:43] and was forbidden to write
[27:48] could it be that we could have been
[27:49] hearing the thunders for
[27:54] ever since the prophet left or even back
[27:57] into this
[27:58] opening of the seals in 63
[28:01] and still don't know what it was
[28:05] that's a later message
[28:08] about three months down the road but
[28:11] just getting the point because of what
[28:12] he says here
[28:15] he said it's no seven thunders
[28:17] they heard thunder
[28:19] but john heard him the thunder
[28:23] but he's forbidden to write
[28:25] now you may have your thoughts or
[28:27] whatever
[28:29] uh i'm just honest i try to say it the
[28:31] best way i can because
[28:34] when john came back to write what he saw
[28:38] you know he could only write the symbols
[28:40] and everybody
[28:42] all right but even in his writings of
[28:44] john little john 1 2 3
[28:47] uh he speaks of the antichrist because
[28:49] he saw that
[28:51] he's the only one in the bible that
[28:52] spoke of the antichrist right because he
[28:54] comes back from patmos
[28:55] one two and three john the little john's
[28:57] we called it was written after coming
[28:58] back from patmos
[29:00] all right
[29:00] now
[29:01] so he he could tell about the antichrist
[29:07] and he could tell a lot of things and he
[29:09] tried to tell a lot of things
[29:13] but you know what i believe i believe
[29:15] what was said in those thunders
[29:18] was removed from his mind
[29:21] when you come back to earth
[29:26] would be like the apostle paul if
[29:27] nothing else
[29:29] because the apostle paul went up to the
[29:31] third heaven and he said same things i
[29:33] can't talk about
[29:36] when you see things you can't talk about
[29:38] that means you ain't got language to
[29:39] bring it in that's right is that just
[29:42] plain
[29:43] you used to get right
[29:45] like ezekiel saying fire falling out of
[29:47] heaven right i mean seeing nuclear
[29:49] destruction
[29:50] but we'll get down to those things a
[29:52] little later and see if god has spoken
[29:54] to you
[29:56] right
[30:00] have you heard the thunder
[30:02] right ma'am
[30:04] not the seven men if they figured out
[30:05] this one this one that wasn't
[30:08] all of that
[30:13] i never did
[30:14] jury snapping
[30:15] right because that's cardinality
[30:18] oh brother you are a guest of my four
[30:20] minutes no
[30:21] i'm against stupidity
[30:24] that's just the best way to say it
[30:26] all right
[30:28] let's go on to number six where we're at
[30:30] this morning then we'll try to get a
[30:31] thought gets going
[30:32] okay
[30:34] now this is the questions and answers
[30:37] before the seventh seal breaks
[30:40] right
[30:41] so look what he said we find out the
[30:42] corruption that he did in the seventh
[30:43] church eight but the seventh seal
[30:45] doesn't reveal anything
[30:47] what's going to happen to it
[30:51] why
[30:52] where's god going to leave us dangling
[30:57] without a way
[31:00] because at the end of that church age
[31:02] has become a prophetic gift to reveal
[31:04] these things
[31:06] he said are you following all right
[31:09] prophetic gift that
[31:10] fourth combat beast that was the eagle
[31:13] to express and tell us what these things
[31:15] are
[31:16] so then he can tell us what the fifth
[31:18] seal is he can tell us what the six seal
[31:20] is and he can tell us what the seventh
[31:21] seal is
[31:26] no problem
[31:28] all right
[31:30] make a quick jump through in two or
[31:32] three quotes
[31:34] to make sure we stay with it go ahead
[31:35] and number seven
[31:42] and how great is god's grace to reveal
[31:44] his secrets to us in this day amen
[31:49] now we all believe that we're living in
[31:50] the last day we believe that
[31:52] and remember the secret was to be
[31:54] revealed in the last days
[31:56] now god how how does he reveal his word
[32:00] his secrets
[32:02] in secret the bible would you like to
[32:04] read where he says it let's just turn
[32:06] over him see i reveal his secrets
[32:08] now i want you to read amos
[32:10] all right so what does amos 3 7
[32:13] still trumpets blown in the city and the
[32:15] people not
[32:17] be afraid
[32:18] it's got to be evil in the city
[32:21] and the lord has not done it
[32:23] that's odd language for the next
[32:25] statement
[32:27] is simply meaning can
[32:29] a trumpet sound
[32:31] unless it's the gospel trumpet that
[32:34] would come from the prophet
[32:39] and god you know there's evil in the
[32:42] city
[32:45] and it says and the lord has not done it
[32:47] now he didn't do evil
[32:50] he just knows about the evil
[32:53] surely the lord will do nothing but he
[32:56] really reveals his secrets to his
[32:57] servants the prophets now how many times
[32:59] have you heard
[33:00] right around emphasize that
[33:05] how many times have you listened to
[33:07] those words
[33:09] three and seven
[33:11] yep
[33:14] let me just quote a couple
[33:16] and then we'll start reading
[33:20] from the message paradox
[33:22] you don't have to pull these up but
[33:23] again if you want to i'll be going
[33:25] through
[33:27] he said the word always come to the
[33:28] prophet
[33:31] he said in that prophet god said then
[33:33] disproves it
[33:35] then a prophet means not only to speak
[33:37] the word
[33:39] but also to foretell
[33:41] and a divine interpreter of the word
[33:45] divine written word right
[33:47] i like the way he emphasizes
[33:50] the word came to the prophet it's a
[33:52] complete revelation of jesus christ
[33:55] all right
[33:56] the word always comes to the prophet
[33:58] message
[33:59] when their eyes were opened
[34:02] there stood john out in the river and
[34:04] jesus come walking
[34:09] word always come to the prophet
[34:11] amen
[34:12] walked out into the water
[34:15] and came out right
[34:17] word always came to the prophet
[34:21] let's read this one number nine
[34:26] paragraph 101 of the mighty god unveiled
[34:30] and look
[34:32] what he's saying
[34:36] did you notice the one that had
[34:38] give the promise to
[34:40] he brought him forth with the word
[34:43] he had the commandments
[34:45] and after how this this commandment he
[34:47] had
[34:48] the commandment was the word of god
[34:52] now listen the word had never come to
[34:54] the people yet he's about the ten
[34:56] commandments right right
[34:58] the word did not come to the people
[35:01] well the word always goes to the prophet
[35:04] and he was the prophet for the hour
[35:06] it's like jesus was the word john was a
[35:08] prophet and jesus came to him in the
[35:10] water when the word always comes to the
[35:12] prophet look what he said
[35:15] even though moses had the commandments
[35:22] they haven't come to the people yet
[35:27] moses has come down to their carrying
[35:29] them and
[35:30] all right they could read them
[35:32] could they
[35:36] ask you a simple question what language
[35:37] was that ten commandments right
[35:41] i always wondered about this
[35:45] what is hebrew what is greek
[35:52] what's
[35:54] that's just something to fonder over
[35:57] some of you like little points to
[35:58] plunder over so i'll give you one once
[36:00] in a while
[36:06] look at the next one program
[36:07] 172 of the unveiling of god 9
[36:10] 8. the word had to come from moses first
[36:14] see
[36:15] moses had the word
[36:17] they were written by god nobody could
[36:19] interpret them
[36:24] it was in hebrew or greek or any
[36:27] language or
[36:29] you know look like somebody could have
[36:30] told you a little bit about it
[36:33] might have been a heavenly language
[36:36] why because moses had to interpret them
[36:40] first
[36:41] that's the reason he bailed his face
[36:43] because he you see it
[36:45] congratulations amen about what do you
[36:47] say
[36:48] moses had to interpret them
[36:55] god wrote moses interpreted
[37:02] click the next one
[37:04] god hiding in simplicity
[37:07] albuquerque new mexico paragraph 261.
[37:13] he had the word of god and he spoke that
[37:15] word and when he did it become from
[37:17] god's thought
[37:19] the word is a thought expressed and so
[37:21] then when god thought it
[37:23] and put it in moses mind
[37:26] and he spoke it
[37:28] it become a word amen
[37:30] you got the order
[37:32] that's in the seal book i'll find it for
[37:34] you where brett around
[37:36] first it was god's thought then it was
[37:38] moses thought
[37:40] he said it ain't the word yet
[37:43] he said then
[37:44] moses speaks it
[37:46] it becomes a word so look at it
[37:48] but in in his mind he spoke to the kind
[37:50] of word moses turned around and went
[37:52] back maybe to defy something where the
[37:53] word of god spoke by the lips listen
[37:57] the creative word of god that was spoke
[37:59] by the lips of a mortal man
[38:01] that's a wonderful thing god gave it to
[38:04] moses look at the next one progress 67
[38:06] of the fourth seal
[38:10] the word itself is spirit is spirit and
[38:11] word form and then you see when it's
[38:14] quickened or brought to life
[38:15] the spirit of the word goes to work and
[38:17] acts
[38:18] because that
[38:19] now look here a thought has to be a
[38:22] thought before it can be a word
[38:24] and then when a thought is presented
[38:26] it's a word
[38:28] now this is
[38:31] that
[38:32] god's thought
[38:34] he has placed in the word
[38:37] and what
[38:38] and when we receive it from him
[38:42] it becomes a word
[38:50] this is god's thought
[38:54] right
[38:55] evidently he's pointing towards the
[38:56] bible or doing
[38:58] something this is god's dog
[39:02] oh brother dallas to work
[39:04] oh wonderful
[39:11] jeremiah had to speak it before right
[39:13] now you know what i mean
[39:17] the prophets when they got it
[39:19] look what he said
[39:23] god revealed to moses what to do
[39:26] moses spoke it and it happened
[39:29] that's really when it comes from god
[39:32] and we find out that it stimulates it
[39:34] gives you because it's god's word
[39:38] reigned out beyond nature
[39:40] but what he said
[39:42] he said this is god's thought
[39:46] he's placed in the word
[39:48] and when we
[39:50] receive it from
[39:51] him
[39:53] it becomes worked
[39:54] amen you know all the word that we
[39:56] really have is what's revealed
[39:58] right yeah
[40:00] i got a lot of book holding my hand
[40:04] but only what's revealed is the word
[40:05] right
[40:08] well the rest of us no good now
[40:12] don't be carnal
[40:15] we see it's the word of god
[40:18] god spoke it
[40:21] moses received it
[40:23] as a thought within him
[40:25] and moses went out and spoke it
[40:28] right and there come flies and fleas and
[40:30] frogs and things
[40:33] because the word had always come to the
[40:34] prophet
[40:36] all right
[40:38] now
[40:39] with that thought in mind let's
[40:42] see what is revealed in this seventh
[40:44] seal this recent things the prophet says
[40:46] it is
[40:48] and then maybe we can see that well
[40:50] that's what it is
[40:52] you know
[40:54] because he tells us going to number 10
[41:00] verse 77 of the seventh seal
[41:04] now the eighth chapter only reveals the
[41:06] scene of
[41:08] the scene of the seventh seal where
[41:10] nothing else
[41:11] is revealed
[41:12] and nothing is not revealed in the
[41:14] seventh seal
[41:16] that has nothing to do with the seventh
[41:17] chapter
[41:19] it's the revealing of the seventh seal
[41:21] it's perfectly mute
[41:24] it's wonderful
[41:26] if only that time i'll try a few places
[41:29] to show you all the way back from
[41:31] genesis this seventh chapter this
[41:33] seventh seal is spoke off from the very
[41:36] beginning in genesis the seventh seal
[41:39] moved
[41:40] right right up
[41:41] all right now number one
[41:45] what do we see under the seventh seal a
[41:47] scene
[41:50] a scene
[41:53] all right so we got something
[41:55] to go on
[41:58] but we need to know what that scene is
[42:03] whatever that scene is called all of the
[42:06] people in heaven
[42:09] to create a scene
[42:13] because they stopped
[42:17] right
[42:19] stood at all
[42:23] see they created a scene because the
[42:24] scene is like an act of a play you know
[42:28] scene one scene two but you know
[42:31] all right
[42:33] so we see that
[42:37] the eighth chapter only reveals a scene
[42:40] one
[42:41] silence in heaven great space half power
[42:45] but that's something to start on
[42:49] yep
[42:53] what we need to know is just what caused
[42:54] that
[42:56] what kind of a scene would take place it
[42:58] would cause all of those cherubims and
[43:00] seraphims that were flying through the
[43:02] sky right
[43:04] worshiping singing holy holy holy
[43:10] and they all hushed
[43:15] we can go back to thoughts and ideas
[43:19] but let's just continue on to see what
[43:21] the prophet had to
[43:24] say okay now another thought is what
[43:29] the seventh seal has to be in the book
[43:35] because it spoke up from genesis
[43:38] you know the corporal body of jesus
[43:40] wasn't in the old testament do you agree
[43:43] who spoke of yes
[43:45] amen
[43:46] isaiah said he'd be beaten to where he
[43:48] couldn't be recognizable yes
[43:52] who was spoke of
[43:55] as i was saying a moment ago the coming
[43:57] in of the gentiles
[44:00] was spoke of
[44:01] throughout the old testament
[44:04] who were not brought into a
[44:08] situation other than proselytes
[44:13] until they're coming into the new
[44:14] testament grace
[44:18] but we've got a scene
[44:22] we've got the seal spoke off
[44:24] so we're not looking for something to be
[44:26] added to the book
[44:30] it's got to be in the book
[44:33] the back of it being spoken put it in
[44:35] the book that's right are you with me
[44:39] or else the prophet said this ain't
[44:41] spoke of nowhere
[44:43] but he didn't he said it spoke of right
[44:46] all right
[44:48] now
[44:56] the lamb breaks the seal we won't go
[44:57] over number 11 jump to number 12.
[45:01] the lamb breaks the seal
[45:03] and they stand in hall
[45:07] because the lamb broke the ceiling yes
[45:11] whatever opened up
[45:14] caused a reaction
[45:16] from the people
[45:22] so now let's
[45:23] find out something else that it is
[45:26] it's paragraph 229 of the
[45:29] seventh
[45:30] seal you remember this seventh seal is
[45:33] the end of all things
[45:39] now
[45:42] the end of all things is
[45:47] an odd situation
[45:51] it doesn't always mean that it's
[45:53] annihilated wiped out worn out or
[45:55] whatever
[45:58] because according to the bible christ
[46:00] was the end of the law
[46:03] but he never come to do away with the
[46:05] law
[46:06] he never come to destroy it he come to
[46:08] magnify
[46:11] so the end doesn't mean always you know
[46:15] you fall off a cliff
[46:17] well that ain't the end
[46:20] there's a bottom down there somewhere
[46:24] it may be a mild deep but there's a
[46:26] bottom
[46:28] well that's not all
[46:33] the end of all things
[46:36] that's right
[46:37] the things written in the seal book
[46:39] sealed up with the plan of redemption
[46:41] from before the foundation of the world
[46:43] right
[46:45] it never been ends
[46:49] it is the end now this is the seventh
[46:50] seal
[46:52] this is where he said this is my
[46:53] revelation
[46:54] right it is in it's the end of the
[46:57] struggling world
[47:00] it's indestructible nature it's the end
[47:02] of everything
[47:03] and there is the end of the trumpets
[47:05] into the vile into the earth
[47:07] it's it's even the end of time time runs
[47:10] out the bible says so matthew which goes
[47:12] to revelation 10
[47:16] but it's the end
[47:20] when that in the days of this great
[47:22] thing to happen
[47:26] remember when we read it happen
[47:29] everything runs out in this time
[47:32] the end of the at the end of this
[47:33] seventh season
[47:35] then even the ends of
[47:37] the seven seals the end
[47:39] but it even ends the seven seals
[47:43] notice it's the end of the church ages
[47:46] it's the end of the seven seals it's the
[47:48] end of the trumpets into the violence
[47:50] even industry in the millennium
[47:53] that's only seven seals
[47:55] do anywhere in the bible
[48:01] give the time to this time of that
[48:07] in the bible when you find something
[48:09] come to an end
[48:11] you realize
[48:14] that you're speaking on the seventh seal
[48:18] when the old testament came to an end
[48:24] which was calvary and then the
[48:25] resurrection
[48:27] bringing forth
[48:30] it was the ending of that old testament
[48:41] so end can be a
[48:43] beautiful word if you go home and look
[48:45] it up
[48:48] because the word end can mean even be
[48:50] reproduced
[48:52] when something is reproduced it comes to
[48:54] an end
[48:57] well then you can call it reproduction
[48:59] all right
[49:00] but the end now so we found that it's a
[49:03] scene
[49:09] we found that it's in the end of all
[49:11] things
[49:14] getting good getting some material
[49:17] to show us some things
[49:24] he says what happened is those don't
[49:26] pull up 13 is okay they don't hurt it
[49:30] let's go over here to revelation to
[49:32] begin
[49:33] what happened is those seven thunders
[49:35] that he earth under
[49:36] and was forbidden to write that's what
[49:38] the mystery is laying behind those seven
[49:40] consecutive thunders rolling out
[49:44] go ahead at number 14.
[49:45] very out 255.
[49:50] seven god's perfect number
[49:54] run around knock six times on the pulpit
[49:58] you'll probably find on the other
[49:59] versions he'll say seven
[50:02] just right down the road seven thunders
[50:05] uttered straight together like they were
[50:07] spelling they're spelling out something
[50:10] notice at that time john started to
[50:12] write
[50:13] and he hears it
[50:16] he knows what it is
[50:18] right that's right
[50:20] he said don't write it jesus never spoke
[50:23] of it john couldn't write it angels know
[50:25] nothing about it what is it
[50:31] it's the thing that jesus said
[50:35] even the angels of heaven didn't know
[50:37] nothing about it
[50:42] all right you can make that in a
[50:44] situation
[50:46] and say they don't know this or they
[50:47] don't know that
[50:51] but look at your next word
[50:55] he didn't know it himself
[51:01] jesus didn't know it
[51:05] what is the thing that jesus didn't know
[51:08] that only god would know it
[51:11] and he told us when we began to see
[51:13] these signs coming up
[51:18] what is it jesus don't know
[51:24] what's going up 14 80.
[51:29] well that day in an hour
[51:31] noah no man
[51:34] no
[51:35] not the angels of heaven
[51:38] but my father only
[51:41] now pull up the next one
[51:45] that was matthew this is mark 13 32
[51:49] but of that day and that hour knoweth no
[51:52] man no
[51:53] not the angels which are in heaven
[51:56] neither the son
[51:59] but the father
[52:02] what is it that jesus didn't know
[52:06] one thing he didn't know was his part in
[52:08] the kingdom
[52:11] all right
[52:13] the blood runs after he comes to patmos
[52:16] and begins to write
[52:18] he's beginning to see what's taking
[52:20] place
[52:21] all right
[52:23] but what are those two scriptures
[52:25] talking about
[52:28] they're talking about the coming of the
[52:30] lord
[52:33] see jesus didn't know when he's coming
[52:41] he didn't know the actual date or time
[52:45] of this coming
[52:48] what he said
[52:50] son don't know
[52:52] well now wait a minute brother tell you
[52:53] the ears got us all confused because
[52:55] father's gone holy ghost you won you
[52:57] fought it all together how can one no
[53:00] and does not know
[53:02] that's a revelation
[53:06] that's right it's a revelation so go
[53:08] pray
[53:10] that's not for me to try to interpret or
[53:12] figure out
[53:15] it's for me to have common sense to read
[53:19] you'd say well that was just his flesh
[53:22] okay i'm gonna argue with him
[53:24] but he didn't know
[53:26] when he was coming all right
[53:29] brother said he also didn't know his
[53:31] part in the kingdom
[53:33] until after he come to batman
[53:36] he said god withheld that from him
[53:45] you got to talk to your prophet not me
[53:50] well now look what he goes to on the
[53:52] seventh seal paragraph 394
[53:55] number 15.
[54:00] now there was some reason that god let
[54:02] the seventh voices be thundered
[54:05] because it must come
[54:07] for we find that christ the lamb took
[54:11] the the book in his hand
[54:13] and he opened the seventh
[54:15] open that seventh seal which is a hidden
[54:17] mystery
[54:19] no one knows it
[54:20] but it's right along with what he said
[54:23] no one would know his coming
[54:28] they would also
[54:31] they also would not know about this
[54:33] seventh under mystery
[54:36] he said it's connected
[54:39] he said he seen it unfold to the seven
[54:41] thunders
[54:43] so now we're talking about the coming of
[54:45] the lord
[54:50] we've already got a scene we've got the
[54:52] end of all things
[54:55] now we got to come into the lord
[55:00] and we've gotten seven thunders
[55:03] because he said they're connected
[55:07] so now he's putting the seven thunders
[55:11] under revelation 8 1.
[55:16] they're in revelations 10 4.
[55:20] right
[55:21] but he's bringing them under revelations
[55:24] 8 1.
[55:25] the thunders
[55:29] the scene
[55:30] the coming of the lord
[55:34] he said they're all connected together
[55:37] he said he seen it unfold if you're
[55:39] looking down here
[55:41] the seven thunders
[55:45] what is the coming of the lord to you
[55:50] well one of these days the skies are
[55:52] going to split
[55:53] and boy we're going to see him descend
[55:56] that's what we used to think
[55:58] right
[56:01] i used to tell you somebody told me i
[56:02] was a kid and i looked around they told
[56:04] me that it'd be a great big cloud look
[56:06] like a number of them i never didn't
[56:07] understand why they told me that but i
[56:09] was still a kid and every time a cloud
[56:11] would come up i'd run out and look and
[56:12] see
[56:13] ain't coming this one
[56:15] he's that stupid well i believed it
[56:18] right right man
[56:20] i mean i was at least looking for
[56:21] something right
[56:25] but you see
[56:28] the coming of the lord
[56:33] now i'm putting this in mind so you'll
[56:35] think
[56:36] then we'll go back to what he's saying
[56:39] i believe and i've always taught you
[56:42] that the second coming of jesus christ
[56:44] started on dead pentecost
[56:46] i believe that right
[56:49] i believe that
[56:52] but that way he can make it something
[56:53] personal to you and i think amen amen
[56:57] because he comes in us in the new birth
[56:59] right right that's right
[57:03] then he could put us like john that's
[57:04] crying out for a deliverer amen
[57:08] wanting these bodies to be delivered
[57:10] explain the situation
[57:14] but one day there will be
[57:17] a completion of those things that's
[57:19] right now remember the seventh seal be
[57:21] in the end of all things so the coming
[57:23] of the lord can be personal
[57:28] and then one day he will come to israel
[57:32] through two prophets
[57:34] that'll be his coming one
[57:36] then in the millennium
[57:38] we'll meet him
[57:40] and that's his coming
[57:42] right yes
[57:43] a lot of things get involved with the
[57:45] coming of the lord
[57:47] a lot of scripture
[57:50] that's why i say that that seven seals
[57:52] broke up from genesis what else could a
[57:54] man say how greater could he have made
[57:56] the statement
[57:59] that he spoke of from genesis
[58:02] all of the scriptures
[58:05] i'm yet to get this money to think about
[58:06] it
[58:07] right around said jesus spoke more of
[58:09] his second coming than he did of his
[58:11] first coming right
[58:16] remember the kingdom the mothers wanting
[58:18] to sit one on one side on the other all
[58:20] of the scripture is unveiling
[58:23] the coming of the lord
[58:26] spoke of
[58:32] but he started his second coming on the
[58:34] dead
[58:36] in the new birth
[58:42] let's just read a few things and then
[58:44] we'll
[58:45] quit go ahead number 16.
[58:48] let me read pretty fast god's great
[58:50] mystery christ mr god revealed program
[58:52] 106. god's great mystery how it's a
[58:55] secret he kept it a secret nobody knows
[58:57] nothing about me and the angels didn't
[58:59] understand
[59:00] he didn't reveal it
[59:02] that's the reason on earth seventh
[59:03] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[59:05] there was silence
[59:07] jesus when he was here on earth they
[59:09] wanted to know when he would come
[59:11] he said it's not even the son himself
[59:13] don't know when it's going to happen
[59:16] see god has this all to himself it's a
[59:18] secret and that's the reason there were
[59:20] silence in heaven perspective half hour
[59:23] and seven thunders under their voices
[59:25] and john was even forbidden to write it
[59:28] see the coming of the lord
[59:32] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[59:33] of how he will come and when he will
[59:35] come it's a good thing
[59:38] that he doesn't
[59:42] look at 17.
[59:46] program 155 of the souls that are in
[59:48] prison now
[59:50] the lamb has redeemed it
[59:52] but he could not come forth until every
[59:54] name was revealed
[59:56] and that was taking place
[1:00:00] was taking place
[1:00:01] under the sixth seal
[1:00:03] before the seventh room
[1:00:06] then the spotless lamp came for what he
[1:00:08] had redeemed
[1:00:12] as you read that read that line over
[1:00:16] and you see what the seventh seal is
[1:00:18] that's right
[1:00:19] that's why it's not revealing some
[1:00:22] rejective
[1:00:23] form right
[1:00:29] if all names are reeled under sixth seal
[1:00:31] that's redemptive
[1:00:34] what's he doing
[1:00:37] then the lamb
[1:00:38] came for what he had redeemed
[1:00:44] that's what he's coming in this end time
[1:00:46] for yes for what he redeemed at calvary
[1:00:50] which is body spirit soul of mankind
[1:00:53] right
[1:00:55] come to claim what he had redeemed
[1:01:02] you when he gave me the new birth that
[1:01:03] only made the soul
[1:01:06] and lay claim on the body
[1:01:09] listen
[1:01:11] he's already got it right here in the
[1:01:12] book
[1:01:14] taking it from his hands now he's coming
[1:01:16] to receive what he has redeemed
[1:01:20] that's his work
[1:01:21] he's done he's going to receive it oh
[1:01:24] what a time
[1:01:25] that's proven in the seventh seal proved
[1:01:27] it
[1:01:29] come back and took the book of
[1:01:30] redemption amen
[1:01:32] what took the book of redemption brother
[1:01:33] after the lamb number seven seal
[1:01:36] right what do you say right
[1:01:39] so the seventh seal must be the lamb
[1:01:43] right right
[1:01:44] the lamb must be the seventh seal let's
[1:01:46] put it that way
[1:01:48] that's why jesus preached six seals
[1:01:51] and never said a thing about the
[1:01:52] settlement
[1:01:54] why because that's who he was
[1:01:57] or either where you want to put it what
[1:01:58] he was or
[1:02:00] any way you want to bring that
[1:02:01] terminology
[1:02:03] he was the seventh seal
[1:02:06] he still is that soon that's right
[1:02:09] but he's coming to redeem
[1:02:11] now this is what everybody likes go to
[1:02:13] number
[1:02:15] eight uh 19.
[1:02:18] everybody likes this statement you know
[1:02:20] to use
[1:02:23] which is the feast of the trumpets
[1:02:24] burger 175.
[1:02:29] 176 says that the seventh seal hasn't
[1:02:31] broke yet you know
[1:02:33] that's just coming
[1:02:39] well see that
[1:02:40] ain't broke
[1:02:44] but he done told you the seal was broken
[1:02:48] it's coming they make manufacturing
[1:02:49] right
[1:02:50] it's begun in the new birth
[1:02:55] and it'll never be revealed to the
[1:02:56] public that's right
[1:03:02] so we'll read that
[1:03:03] number 20.
[1:03:07] now we have in the completion here
[1:03:10] now by the grace of god all the
[1:03:12] mysteries are the six seals
[1:03:14] that's been sealed and we understand
[1:03:16] and know here that that seventh seal is
[1:03:18] not to be known to the public
[1:03:22] now it's coming and the hour is coming
[1:03:25] when the destruction of the world only
[1:03:27] it's out of the end it's not to be known
[1:03:30] to the public
[1:03:33] but now have you caught on to one thing
[1:03:35] the reason seven is the end of all
[1:03:37] things
[1:03:39] because the number seven is completion
[1:03:41] right
[1:03:43] that's right
[1:03:44] number seven is completion right
[1:03:47] but it can't be anything other than that
[1:03:49] part of an article
[1:03:50] look at this next from the seventh seal
[1:03:53] number 21.
[1:03:56] see israel's gathering in our
[1:03:59] own homeland but you noticed
[1:04:01] he omitted the set revealing this seven
[1:04:04] minute omitted the revelation of the
[1:04:06] seventh seal
[1:04:08] and year when the seventh seal when it
[1:04:10] opened
[1:04:11] he also admitted omitted it again
[1:04:15] so we see that it is a complete mystery
[1:04:18] therefore
[1:04:20] the hour is not yet for these these
[1:04:22] mystery to be
[1:04:24] known all right
[1:04:27] therefore
[1:04:29] we know that we're we're look therefore
[1:04:32] we're this far and the rest of it will
[1:04:34] be known right around about the time
[1:04:37] that jesus appears on earth again for
[1:04:39] his bride or whatever takes place at
[1:04:42] that time
[1:04:44] all right see don't try to figure it out
[1:04:46] just go and pray
[1:04:55] go to the license
[1:04:58] 22 feast of the trumpets program 147.
[1:05:02] because the seventh seal there was
[1:05:04] silence
[1:05:06] no one knew that was a minute or hour
[1:05:10] that christ would come
[1:05:13] as he revealed to us
[1:05:17] the seventh seal then there's a lot of
[1:05:19] things
[1:05:23] the same as
[1:05:25] the end of all times it's the thunders
[1:05:29] it's the coming of the
[1:05:35] see lord now let me end it with these
[1:05:37] words
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:41] we are not just to be talking about the
[1:05:43] second coming
[1:05:47] thank you
[1:05:48] now forgive me for being plain but just
[1:05:51] i'm throwing off them no church or not
[1:05:52] but you know how we used to believe
[1:05:56] we used to preach about the coming of
[1:05:57] the holy ghost of the day of pentecost
[1:06:01] but
[1:06:03] we never
[1:06:05] related ourselves back to very much
[1:06:09] and if you ask a good baptist
[1:06:12] to express to you about the new birth
[1:06:15] and he'll tell you
[1:06:17] that i've got the holy ghost because
[1:06:19] they come on their pentecost
[1:06:23] go talk with people just just leave them
[1:06:25] up to a little mount for you
[1:06:28] when it comes to their pentagon
[1:06:31] well i don't mean you now
[1:06:33] i'm gonna be in there and i'm a trainer
[1:06:35] because we owe more than that
[1:06:38] you get my point i'm a millionaire could
[1:06:40] have gotten a bite it's just not my name
[1:06:52] my bible said
[1:06:54] that my god owned the cattle on a
[1:06:56] thousand heels that's right right
[1:06:58] and i said it young's the taters too
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:04] you know
[1:07:05] it's all mine
[1:07:08] i just don't have the ability to receive
[1:07:10] it
[1:07:11] right
[1:07:13] the day you receive the new birth
[1:07:16] god laid plain on these bodies
[1:07:19] well you're not going to get a new one
[1:07:23] it's going to be this body redeemed
[1:07:26] now we're coming to the position that we
[1:07:29] should be saying i'm redeemed
[1:07:31] meaning the body the word that god can
[1:07:33] bring it into reality
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:37] but you see i'm not looking for the
[1:07:38] coming of the lord
[1:07:43] i've been watching that for a long time
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:47] because the coming of the lord according
[1:07:49] to my understanding is not a corporal
[1:07:51] physical coming back here
[1:07:53] to take us out
[1:07:54] so the seventh seal wouldn't be dealing
[1:07:56] with a corporal body of jesus christ to
[1:07:58] stand on earth
[1:08:01] he would be dealing as the things the
[1:08:02] prophet would say that he becomes so
[1:08:04] visible among us that he'll raise the
[1:08:06] dead and we'll go in the rapture
[1:08:10] not a physical corporal type of thing
[1:08:15] but a revelation of god's word
[1:08:18] now
[1:08:19] the life statement
[1:08:21] then when the word is revealed now not
[1:08:23] letters we've been through all today
[1:08:25] about the letter of it
[1:08:27] the oral roberts university could have
[1:08:29] everything of brother brown and could
[1:08:30] make you a speech you'll never see
[1:08:34] but they know nothing about the coming
[1:08:36] of the lord right other than the easter
[1:08:39] sky split the thing happens
[1:08:41] coming down you know
[1:08:43] and we know that's not going to happen
[1:08:45] that way
[1:08:49] see then they could
[1:08:51] they missed his first coming
[1:08:53] because they had it figured out how it
[1:08:55] had to be
[1:08:56] could we miss his second coming
[1:08:59] that's right
[1:09:00] by trying to figure out something
[1:09:04] see people are saying to me about you
[1:09:06] bro brother dale don't you think we're
[1:09:08] gonna have more signs and wonders if
[1:09:09] we're talking about these things
[1:09:15] i told you a long time ago
[1:09:17] you don't believe it
[1:09:20] i can start on a series tomorrow and
[1:09:22] preach week after week
[1:09:24] on divine healing and bring in the
[1:09:25] manifestation i didn't say to me
[1:09:29] manifestation of healings will come into
[1:09:31] being
[1:09:38] and even
[1:09:40] if we could get
[1:09:42] this body totally made new
[1:09:45] right there's no rapture amen
[1:09:48] well you want to type come on
[1:09:51] abraham and sarah were made
[1:09:54] young
[1:09:58] but they weren't raptured that's right
[1:10:00] that's why it said we'd be changed in
[1:10:02] the moment the twinkling of an eye yes
[1:10:07] the prophet of god said if it was just
[1:10:08] his body made young he said that won't
[1:10:10] work
[1:10:15] it's got to be made eternal
[1:10:18] the revealed word
[1:10:20] is the only thing i know
[1:10:22] that could change you and i
[1:10:25] wouldn't it be wonderful to drop back
[1:10:28] and be 18 years old
[1:10:35] but now just as i was talking about it i
[1:10:37] could preach divine healing and it will
[1:10:39] come into manifestation
[1:10:41] i know you don't like the way i talk i'm
[1:10:43] sorry
[1:10:45] i'd rather stay 72 years old
[1:10:50] then you'll be 18.
[1:10:57] i don't want to go back there that's
[1:10:58] right
[1:10:59] right here man
[1:11:05] if it takes all age and sickness to
[1:11:07] bring on the coming of the lord because
[1:11:09] i don't mean that is what causes it
[1:11:11] that's right i didn't say that right
[1:11:15] but if we went back there i'd have to
[1:11:17] get 72 again that's right
[1:11:21] and i don't want it
[1:11:24] i don't think so
[1:11:25] wouldn't it be great to have no more
[1:11:27] hurt
[1:11:32] i tried to explain that
[1:11:34] sister regina caught onto something
[1:11:35] about it
[1:11:36] began to express it
[1:11:38] you didn't have a temperature in your
[1:11:40] body you'd die right
[1:11:42] you didn't have a temperature to develop
[1:11:44] in your body to show you that there's
[1:11:46] something wrong you would die
[1:11:49] right
[1:11:50] man
[1:11:51] the temperature then
[1:11:53] we want to fight the temperature
[1:11:56] right and i'm come on honestly
[1:11:58] anybody wants to get rid of it come on
[1:12:00] we're sensible
[1:12:03] but the temperature is telling you
[1:12:05] something wrong somewhere else
[1:12:08] you're treating the symptom that's right
[1:12:10] you're treating the temperature
[1:12:13] by a chemical reaction upon the body by
[1:12:15] an aspirin or something
[1:12:17] and ain't doing a bit of good to what
[1:12:19] you got
[1:12:22] is that right right
[1:12:26] i want to deal with what's causing me to
[1:12:28] have a temperature
[1:12:31] you know look at that straight now
[1:12:33] temperature automatically go money
[1:12:37] you see church
[1:12:39] the opening of the word
[1:12:41] is the coming of the lord
[1:12:46] the word being revealed to you and i is
[1:12:48] the coming of the lord that's right
[1:12:52] he said yeah but i want to see the
[1:12:54] physical well that's wonderful
[1:12:56] so do i
[1:13:01] but somebody's got to get the revelation
[1:13:03] what's going on
[1:13:05] why can't it be us
[1:13:07] amen that's right
[1:13:09] and say i'm redeemed amen come on
[1:13:11] brother
[1:13:13] my love did mine
[1:13:16] glory glory
[1:13:18] christ is mine
[1:13:21] you see church
[1:13:23] the great men that i've been speaking of
[1:13:25] in the bible
[1:13:28] the greatest writer of them all the
[1:13:30] apostle paul
[1:13:32] in summing up his
[1:13:36] revelation and things in the book of
[1:13:38] corinthians
[1:13:43] he said we see not all things under his
[1:13:45] feet
[1:13:49] remember that
[1:13:50] yes
[1:13:52] oh what do you mean he put out
[1:13:53] everything daddy
[1:13:56] paul said we don't see everything under
[1:13:58] his feet
[1:14:01] but he said we see jesus
[1:14:04] go back over in the writings and he said
[1:14:07] the last enemy
[1:14:08] to be destroyed
[1:14:11] he's dead
[1:14:13] brother says we're still dying
[1:14:16] so that effect is still here
[1:14:22] all i want
[1:14:25] is for him to come in me and do what
[1:14:28] he's doing back in
[1:14:34] he raised that body up
[1:14:38] from the grave amen
[1:14:40] that's right
[1:14:42] he made that body eternal
[1:14:44] and went sailing through this guy
[1:14:49] until that happens
[1:14:53] we're gonna die
[1:14:56] i see jesus
[1:15:05] i see him with the word
[1:15:12] the angels out there for brother brown
[1:15:14] when they're looking down
[1:15:15] he said that was jesus christ
[1:15:18] looking down from heaven
[1:15:23] they didn't tell him those seagulls out
[1:15:24] there in arizona he says he didn't
[1:15:28] they told him to go home
[1:15:31] he would be made known right
[1:15:35] he comes into the breach and then god in
[1:15:36] simplicity and he says i don't know what
[1:15:38] that first deal is
[1:15:40] now you just made him a liar if you
[1:15:42] think he did
[1:15:47] he got into the first hill he said i
[1:15:49] don't know what that second seal is
[1:15:59] do we believe him
[1:16:03] or is our dependence upon something we
[1:16:05] can concoct
[1:16:07] of our own selves
[1:16:11] well i think it's this
[1:16:15] well good that means your brain's
[1:16:17] working
[1:16:21] the worst revelation
[1:16:25] he destroyed death
[1:16:27] amen
[1:16:32] but you and i are gonna have to destroy
[1:16:33] it that's right that's right
[1:16:36] i can't destroy death i agree with you
[1:16:38] we can't but we can destroy the effects
[1:16:40] that it has
[1:16:45] we can quit dropping and complaining
[1:16:46] about what situations we're in
[1:16:49] of sicknesses and things that's right
[1:16:51] but around says satan's got a hand they
[1:16:54] gotta push at you
[1:16:56] you gotta find out what that is and
[1:16:57] cover it that's right
[1:17:02] great man that god bragged over said he
[1:17:05] was perfect
[1:17:06] satan you can handle
[1:17:09] you just can't take his life
[1:17:16] what is the seventh seal to you and i
[1:17:22] a lot of things
[1:17:25] about silence in heaven
[1:17:27] so the prophet has already told us some
[1:17:29] things now we got another message to get
[1:17:31] on in this and then we'll get into some
[1:17:32] things that
[1:17:34] he says
[1:17:35] that it was to him
[1:17:40] now what do you say it is to you
[1:17:45] mustang
[1:17:46] what do you say it is to you
[1:17:54] i might not see it all
[1:17:56] but i see jesus amen
[1:17:59] let me preach what i see
[1:18:01] until something comes forth
[1:18:03] i see jesus
[1:18:06] made a little lower than the angels for
[1:18:08] suffering
[1:18:11] for you and i
[1:18:14] was withholding it he didn't even know
[1:18:16] when he was coming
[1:18:20] but the prophet said after he went to
[1:18:22] patents
[1:18:24] didn't he you
[1:18:28] you wouldn't withhold it from jesus on
[1:18:30] batman it was withholding john
[1:18:35] jesus knew exactly
[1:18:40] what do we need to worry about the time
[1:18:42] or the hour right
[1:18:45] that's figuring out the 30 minutes of
[1:18:47] cybertron
[1:18:49] what good would it do it's like i told
[1:18:50] you you can say what you want to argue
[1:18:52] what you want to i ain't worried about
[1:18:54] it you'll say it's true
[1:18:56] if we know he was coming tomorrow at two
[1:18:58] o'clock we'd be goofing off in the
[1:19:00] morning
[1:19:04] now don't tell me that you'd know he's
[1:19:06] coming at the end of the week and then
[1:19:07] all week long just
[1:19:10] i ain't eating
[1:19:13] i ain't taking him out
[1:19:16] i'm gonna sit right here
[1:19:23] no
[1:19:25] that's why god done it that way
[1:19:28] to keep us looking
[1:19:32] that's why i always say to your sisters
[1:19:33] that's why i don't preach clothes and
[1:19:35] dress and hair like everybody else that
[1:19:37] i preach in your birth
[1:19:39] but sisters if you look in that mirror
[1:19:42] and are not condemned over what you wear
[1:19:47] but if you see something in there that
[1:19:49] don't look too good
[1:19:52] you got a problem
[1:19:56] let me preach about it screaming holler
[1:20:03] just tell you like it is
[1:20:05] right
[1:20:07] you can't fake that mirror
[1:20:10] it's only reflecting
[1:20:12] what it's looking in
[1:20:18] what's your point
[1:20:21] why shouldn't we live
[1:20:25] to where
[1:20:27] that any second we could turn around
[1:20:30] then jesus would be standing there
[1:20:35] not a corporal body
[1:20:40] but him be standing there
[1:20:44] would we be ashamed
[1:20:46] human mortals yes
[1:20:54] but not ashamed because he's standing
[1:20:56] there
[1:20:58] because he'd have to remember one thing
[1:21:00] if he's standing there
[1:21:02] you ain't lost right right
[1:21:06] everything can be taken care of what do
[1:21:08] we got we will try 288 in the red folks
[1:21:12] ladies
[1:21:13] anybody have a need
[1:21:28] oh
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:10] is
[1:23:09] huh
[1:23:33] oh
[1:24:04] me
[1:24:28] oh
[1:24:33] is
[1:24:49] is
[1:25:15] foreign
[1:25:29] oh
[1:25:53] oh
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:33] one day he said it like this he said i'm
[1:26:36] not saying he's coming
[1:26:39] he said i'm saying he's here
[1:26:42] now that means a whole lot of difference
[1:26:47] you're gonna go home
[1:26:48] sometimes they just get a dictionary
[1:26:52] and just look up the words c-o-m-a
[1:26:56] are coming
[1:27:00] look it up
[1:27:02] my first surprise
[1:27:05] have no reference
[1:27:07] to someone out there coming up here
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:13] no reference
[1:27:16] it's not
[1:27:16] travel
[1:27:18] you think well you tell me so brother
[1:27:20] once you come down to the house
[1:27:23] that's human terminology
[1:27:25] but that's not the word come
[1:27:29] the word khan literally means
[1:27:31] standing here
[1:27:33] you ain't got a thing in the world to do
[1:27:35] with how long it takes me to get to your
[1:27:36] house
[1:27:38] you're not concerned about what car i
[1:27:40] drove
[1:27:41] if i walked or rode a bicycle
[1:27:44] run
[1:27:46] you're concerned with me standing in
[1:27:48] your presence
[1:27:50] that's what the word come mean
[1:27:53] it means it's literal presence
[1:27:57] that's not a parousia presence
[1:28:03] his presence in here
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:18] oh
[1:28:43] oh
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:31] a little baby
[1:29:58] oh
[1:30:19] he's not coming he's here
[1:30:23] because he's not traveling a distance
[1:30:27] see that's what our mind and mentality
[1:30:29] is still
[1:30:30] like
[1:30:32] i thought he went up maybe you don't
[1:30:34] believe the second coming starting the
[1:30:35] day of pentecost but i thought he went
[1:30:37] up and come back
[1:30:40] you know did i miss it he went up he
[1:30:42] came back on the day of pentecost
[1:30:53] but i just always looked at it as a
[1:30:55] change of these bodies and things
[1:30:58] we gotta get to a place
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:15] everything is dependent on whether or
[1:31:17] not you and i
[1:31:21] can quit plugging around
[1:31:24] and get out of seriousness
[1:31:26] paraphrasing this word
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:36] see it's going to be our witnesses
[1:31:39] we'll make sure we got the opportunity
[1:31:52] thank you for your word
[1:31:54] thank you for you
[1:31:56] we know and realize we're looking at
[1:31:59] the eternal god fulfilling his word
[1:32:02] walking among us to manifest himself
[1:32:04] among us
[1:32:07] and lord just one split second we could
[1:32:09] be there
[1:32:11] and no problem
[1:32:13] so why is the problem of our life so
[1:32:15] much
[1:32:18] just happens to walk in you forgive our
[1:32:20] sins
[1:32:21] cleanse us and guide us
[1:32:24] let your love be their father
[1:32:27] we thank you in jesus name
