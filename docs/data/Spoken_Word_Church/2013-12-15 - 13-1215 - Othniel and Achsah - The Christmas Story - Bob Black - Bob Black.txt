TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right number 21. numbers 21. now we're getting along towards the Christmas season so I wanted to go to a Christmas story so this is kind of an odd Christmas Story a different way so before we start reading let's just go to Lauren Prairie George Jesus we thank you for your grace to us for another day to serve you Lord and I pray God that you'll just be with us today and be with the services and this little lesson Lord that you'll open your word to our hearts Lord granted Lord that you'll be with brother Wayne as he ministers and all the other ones that are absent today Lord that you'll just lower any any needs that we have Lord that you'll touch us Lord and remember us Lord today we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so now you know the Christmas story a lot of people around this time will put Jesus in the manger we set up the little mangers and things and and remember him as a little baby but his the the reason that he came as a little baby was because there was a purpose to his life thank you um so the the purpose to his life was uh was something greater than just just laying in a manger and we don't want to remember him as just to uh there was a Even in our walk we we go through we have a starting point and and something that's that we're walking towards and uh so the Christmas story is not just about a little baby late and a Manger but it's about uh the the purpose of his life and so the whole purpose of his life kind of starts back here in numbers 21 I think this sometimes in the Old Testament these little stories and things kind of open up uh open up help us to understand a little bit better what's um things that we that we see in the New Testament so let's just read over here in numbers 21 of the fifth chapter the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness from there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul Louis this light bread God had been raining down bread from putting bread out there for them to gather every morning and all they had to do was just step out and they began to lose it and you know program talked about how that little that bread tasted like honey it was so sweet and it was uh it was nourishment from God and Jesus said I am that bread that that was tied back in there in the Old Testament that came from God out of Heaven to feed you and uh unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me again he said all these things and they began to murmur against that bread there was a type of the bread of life that can't would come in in that little manger would come from God out of heaven and lay there in an unexpected way a little baby laying in in that Manger and they began to murmur against the bread just like you can take this all the way back to the Garden of Eden just like that uh in in the Garden of Eden God came down as his own Messenger to Adam and Eve and brought the word directly to them and they they instead of leaning on God's message he decided went out and took a little something extra and here they are at murmuring against the word of God the bread of life that came from God out of heaven and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people that most people of Israel died because of what they did in the Garden of Eden we were all bitten by the serpent what happened in the Garden of Eden how Satan was able to inject himself by taking one word off of God's word and inject himself into the human race and now we're all uh every every sin every heart they give her trouble was caused by that and you know I I was listening to brother Brandon talking about how you think we think that um see they got one word off one word off and the program was talking about how you think that the Devil Comes will appear with a with a pointy tail and and uh horns on his head and that kind of thing but how does he appear in this day how does he appear he appears in a suit behind the pulpit now that's his word exactly he appears in a suit behind the pulpit and I I was uh just looking at a little form over the weekend on the internet where a message believer is getting talking and I was just observing I just sit back and watch that there's this brother in in South Carolina and I won't name his name but he was putting it all out there that he had been in the message for 50 years and now he's beginning to have doubts that he's believing the right thing now do you think all these 50 years he's been preaching and standing behind the pulpit and I you know I would never say nothing bad about his brother but he's he's saying it out of his own mouth that he's coming up that he's beginning to have a doubt that this is really true but this is the truth now that is a fiery serpent that invites the people and injects in their minds the womb of their mind something that's contrary to God's word and they're bitten and you gotta have you got to have an antidote and the antidote is the full word the bread of life that came down out of heaven when that bread of life yeah yes was laying there in a Manger and I um we were coming over this morning Monica was sharing with some some notes that she had printed out she she went out she found some things like she was just doing a little real simple next week this morning for her little little kitties and she found some little notes that this church had had uh a denominational church had on some things about the the manger and whatnot but it was interesting how they almost had they they could see that one of their little bullet points was that that this little boy in the manger was God in flesh and how you know that's about more than what many people that proclaimed to preach the message are are preaching today is they say that that man in the manger was not God that he wasn't God until the River Jordan and that's a fiery Circle but um you know a lot of these little types in the Old Testament uh you can look at them in many ways you can't you know run around tell us not to just put a period behind anything don't say it now I've got it so you this fiery serpent represents many different things it represents the sin that it was interjected in the human race it represents this false doctrine that people are putting into the hearts and minds of the people and then therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when you look upon it shall live now there's what that little baby in the manger came to do he came to take on all of the Take On The Inheritance that Adam and Eve had given us which was death and give us a new inheritance which was life he came to take on everything that we had everything that was held against us and become sin and be lifted up so that all men could be drawn to him and be saved any man that had been bitten and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it up pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lives and the children of Israel set forward and pitched and Oba now this the journey in Israel that they had they were they wound up in this place in in uh in uh in the wilderness where this little story took place but this story took place that that their Journey started at the same place our journey starts their Journey started back in Exodus the first Stakes of this when Moses came and introduced them to that pointed out what they needed to do to be saved and they had a prophet that told them that pulled away to a lamb you need to put the Lamb's blood over the door of your house and they put the Lamb's blood over the door and their Journey started and it started in such a way that God said this this is such a starting point that I'm going to rewrite your calendar I'm going to change your calorie and it says there in Exodus that he started their calendar in the months I'll be here because that is the time that their Journey began and so your journey starts with the blood too you first have to come under the blood you know that was three brothers talked about how there were three exoduses in the Bible the first Exodus was started by Moses that introduced them to the lamb that poured them to the lamb and they had to put that blood over the little of their door and the second Exodus was John on the River Jordan that pointed the pointed into the lamb Moses had a pillar of fire and John had a pillar of fire that fire came down out of heaven and landed on the a period over Jesus's head and he identified the lamb and led the people from from their old ideas the ideas that they had uh their own conceptions and things and pointed him to a New Testament and then in this day we've got a new x a Third Exodus where we have a prophet too that points us to a risen Christ with the pillar of fire and leads us to leads us to the to the to the same to that bread of life that came down out of heaven that leads us to his word being revealed in US and that every believer I remember brother Wade a few years ago preached that sermon uh three pulls of your journey how did every believer has has uh goes through a process of Journey that starts from believing be uh get getting covered by the blood and then you know uh back in 1954 brother Brown preached those three sermons Redemption by Blood how did they were they were Redeemed by blood that that blood that was over the little of their door and then they came they were running from favor they came to the to the Dead Sea and now they needed another Redemption they needed Redemption not by Blood but by power and the power of the Holy Ghost came down the power of that pillar fire came down and part of the Red Sea has swallowed up all their enemies and then LED them Victorious but there's their Redemption still wasn't complete they still had to go on a journey and they still had to come and cross over the uh the Jordan River and then he preached another sermon after that on the Redemption in completeness and joy because just because you've been uh look at this uh statue of perfect man when you're back when you're born again you're at the foundation but that's not the completeness of your Redemption you have an Earnest of your of your salvation but you continue on in a journey as these as your inheritance is made manifest in you your inheritance your inheritance is is becomes real in your life you're you get virtue and knowledge all these things that are written in God's word that are part of his inheritance part of what he did for you that he died on the cross so that you could have these things and not just these but healing in your body and one day your body will be changed that's part of your inheritance so that's why I want to go to um Joshua let's see Joshua 14. Joshua chapter 14. now Joshua was an interesting book to the believer and brogram taught us that it compared it parallels Ephesians because in the book of Ephesians Paul laid out for the church there inheritance in Ephesians he tells us that there are some Apostles and some some are given Apostles some are given prophets some are giving teachers and so forth and because he's placing out you're inheritance he's saying these people or are given for this purpose you have a purpose and then he he goes on and says wives obey your husbands and so forth wives have a part to do husbands have a part to do children he talks about children he's placing everybody and putting them into their their predestinated their place in life putting them into your inheritance putting you where God wants you to be and Joshua does the same thing with when uh when the children of Israel crossed over the Jordan River Joshua which types the Holy Ghost began to place the children of Israel into their inheritance now remember brother and taught how that um when when those uh mother the mothers cried out uh Leah and Rachel in childbirth that she prophesied where it and those labor pains prophesied where those children were going to be placed positionally when they got to the promised land and so we can see in the Book of Joshua when they get to the promised land Joshua the Holy Spirit begins to Plate Place them put them positionally where they should be then the children in Joshua chapter 14 verse 6. but then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of jafana the kid as I said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee and kadish barnia and he goes on and talking in verse 8 he says because I wholly follow the Lord my God he's telling you he's reminded him you know how how that he followed the kadish Garnier he didn't depart from the word that was promised to them and and when they went over and saw the land it was promised by God to Caleb and Joshua that this land where wherever you touched your feet I'm going to give it to you it was that was their inheritance and the land of the Believers not just it it's all the promises in the Bible everything that God has promised to you and your flesh your flesh is Tied by that land you know because God has promised that one day he's going to change our mortal bodies to be like his he'll change our bodies and he'll change the whole earth he'll purify it by by fire and cleanse it of everything that's not righteous now back down in verse 12. yeah when he's Josh Caleb was getting his inheritance now therefore give me this mountain where where of the Lord's thinking that day for thou heard us in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of jafona Hebron for an inheritance man Hebrew is important because that is where Abraham met God in Genesis Chapter 18 and Genesis chapter 17 is the type of Abraham receiving the Holy Ghost walk before me and be thou perfect God told Abraham and in Genesis Chapter 18 then Abraham came and told a god came to Abraham and told him the secrets the secret Mysteries uh revealed to him the secret of what was going to happen to Sodom and Gomorrah and began to reveal open to him The Seekers and that's what happens to the True Believer you go through justification of sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost and then the God begins to open his word to you and make it manifest to you and Joshua blessed him I gave on the Cave of the son of jeopona Hebrew inferred inheritance Hebrew therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of jafana the kennesite unto this day because of he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel so he inherited the place where Abraham walked with God and then over in uh in the next chapter chapter 15. verse 14. chapter 15 verse 14. and Caleb and this is really what I'm getting to you and Caleb drove three sons of anak shishai and ahiman and Talma and the children of manic but he's driving out I believe this is kind of typing that he's driving out that trinitarian Doctrine and and restoring that there's just one God he's bringing one God back to this old Pagan land and he went up this to the inhabitants of Deborah in the name of Deborah is the Old Testament that the Hebrew word for the Oracle or the holy of holy the holy place and this city was called deeper but before it had another name and it was called before it was called Bieber it was called courgette Seifer and Caleb said he the smileth kerjaf see for and taketh it to him will I give oxa my daughter to wife so now here we've got we've got a type uh we've got Caleb telling his little uh the younger man if you go take this city then what I will give to you is a wife I'll give you a bride now you know there's a lot of times in the Old Testament where uh when David went up to Goliath he he there was something that he would get for for defeating Goliath the the reward for defeating Goliath wasn't just honor and fame but the reward he got for defeating Goliath was he got a bride he got Saul's daughter that was promised If any man can defeat this this man he'll get a bride now the reward that Jesus got when he defeated Goliath on the cross was he got a bride that's what he that's that's what the reward was and so now think about this when off Neil went to courage at cepher here's the value that he placed on that city was the value that he saw in Ox AXA he looked at oxen and see he said I this is the kind of person that I want to be my wife and he put He took the value of this woman and he put that on care Jeff cefer the value that he saw encourage that Seaford in taking that CD was what he saw in that woman and I believe that's what when Jesus was on the cross dying for our sins he what the value that he put in in all of the agony and the soul that he went through was the value that we have to him he looked out and saw he looked beyond and saw us and saw that all of that would be worth it because he would get us he would get a bride somebody that would would uh manifest what was back there in Genesis so you know AXA did the same thing you know she was looking for somebody that had value too she was looking for somebody that uh she was looking for a man that that her father Caleb would would regard as a real lion a line of the tribe of Judas and you know in in uh maybe look at this this declaration in in this way what Caleb says is there any man that can go and take this seat and it's really interesting to look at what these these names mean because othniel means the lion of Judah or or the lion and he you know he was part of the tribe of Judah so he he's you know typing the lion of the tribe of Judah and Kurt Josh safer means the city of the book now he's going to take the city of the book and when he takes the city of the book he gets a wife he gets a bride hahaha and off new the son of kidaz the brother of Caleb took it and he gave him oxa his daughter to wife and I'm going to finish this real quick that's his name What's that question that would be his niece that's right accent was Caleb's daughter and Caleb is off Neil's nephew uh uncle it was his nephew yeah and he gave him oxide his daughter to wife so let's look at this look at this this way who is worthy to take the book and then the line of the tribal Judah comes and takes the book and and he and he gets a wife and what does oxa mean oxa means uh bursting the Veil which is another way of saying the unveiling the unveil and you know uh I'm gonna finish on this their program preached the sermon the unveiling of God and I want to read some of these um here he's got his bride and I want to just read some of the things that brother Brown said in the unveiling with God and we'll finish and that now that's this is kind of an odd Christmas story but that's really what the Christmas story is that he came in a Manger to grow up to go through the trials of life to suffer through life and go through this journey just like the children of Israel went through a journey to get there in here because he went through a journey to get in his inheritance and we go through a journey to get our inheritance the trials of life and things tribulation work of patience on up through the statue of perfect man and then he he got his inheritance and what was his inheritance his inheritance was I believe it was so much more than just his flesh it was his flesh and it was also a bride that would cut that came out of him on the on the cross with water blood and spirit so that we his bride could be made manifest so in the unveiling of God 1964 brother random said we in him then we being in him we are still veiled to the religionists and professors of the world see our Glory that we have and enjoying we are still veiled to them Outsiders they think we're crazy enough again to see see that's right but we who are in here in Christ baptized into him into him we are partakers of this Glory see but not on the outside you're still looking into denying it see so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is we're invited into him which is hid the unbelievers by the veil of human flesh see they know that Glory they read of it it's in the word here the glory of God and things like that it's just the word for them to us it's a manifestation see it is no more word it's a reality now that's why AXA is the unveiling the bursting of The Veil The revealing who God is uh every some more the unveilable god 1964 paragraph 245. now it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality we are in him now we're enjoying now we Behold Him now he's seeing the word manifesting himself it's hid out there because why is veiled in human flesh where's this where's it Vale that's right oh they say that bunch of people where did they go to school what what education do they have where what what do they come from what group do they belong to see huh see they don't get it a man said to another man the other day said you have to belong to a denomination to be a Christian he said I am a Christian I don't belong to any of them said God taking this cancer out of me said now what do you think about it it was a doctor he said show me the denominations doing it see all right see it's still Veil where is it Veil now see see what I read numbers how that he took upon our sin he took upon he became us so that we could become him on that cross so that we could become unveiled uh he could become unveiled in US I don't want to I have nothing to unveil it's him coming unfailing us and uh you know because Adam what they did in the Garden of Eden he he lost the book he lost the right to produce Genesis 1 26 27 but now God came and took it back so that he could produce and now it's it's produced but it's veil to the world it's hidden behind a veil of Flesh and then I'm feeling of God 1964 paragraph 287 notice Made Alive and today when the world is manifested in human vessels veils it's absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back to God being baptized into him according to First Corinthians 12 we become identified with him he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to the traditions and things to reveal him to others die to the denominations to reveal him to others and I'll just finish with this but remember there is something in the old book that promised that there will be a predestinating ordained hand come one day that would pick it up and make the word of this book through a predestinated heart to the task that it's made for reveal the promises that's in it it might look oh like an old bunch of Holy Rollers or something other but just take the Master's Hand the word on it to reveal that word and it becomes more than a Holy Roller it becomes that to every one of us having it friends it's not a bunch of fanaticism it depends on Whose hand the bow is in he's talking about the master Fiddler that that can if he knows how to play it he can produce something amazing a real Masterpiece so that's uh I that's the real Christmas story it's not just that God came in a manger and that's the end of the story and you know the even the the when the wise men came the Magi came they testified of what he was going to do to claim his inheritance by by the gifts that they brought they brought gold frankincense some Merle which testifies of deity dedicating himself to death that he was dedicating himself to the task of bringing back that inheritance that was lost by Adam so we'll stop right there
