here yesterday in the Bible study and we pray the Lord would bless her and be with us and all any anything else I generally forget something all right Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your grace unto us Lord and we look at and we see a lot missing we know that some are here doing this and doing that sicknesses and things but we just pray that you would bless each one of us with your presence and maybe they can look in on the services or later can view the the things Lord and they can see that you know that we're here and trying to manifest whatever we can for the hour that we're walking upon the Earth we love you we thank you we pray that you would just give us Lord your understanding because that's our desire more than anything not just a head knowledge but a revelation to be able to speak upon Thy word we love you and we thank you bless those that are sick among us and the different ones that are not here because of that we pray that you'd bless and guide we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen let's go to Hebrews 111 and2 then we'll go to verse 7 all right now Faith is a substance of things H for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report all right now we get over to verse 7 it says by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith you may be SE to the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word and we're trying to take the things that we're talking about the Warriors of faith and talking about them in relationship to us all you know coming to where we're at to see ourselves it's not to just learn the knowledge of them and what they done they live their lives out as an example for you and I all right see they spoke of us it's not us speaking of them we talk about them but they really were speaking of us to come down and that's what we've been trying to to cover with the one you know that where we can see it like Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and see he had a revelation that he was born in his mama's blood from his daddy's blood and and he knew it wasn't fruit so he could offer that you know by Revelation all right then we moved up to uh dealing with uh Enoch and how that he was trans ated because God took him and because he pleased God he walked with God the prophet said with raptured faith all right he pleased God and remember I I asked the question how can you walk with God is it our lives that uh we live is that what pleases God or is it the Revelation that we're able to receive of what he had has done for us then our lives are supposed to be an outward manifestation of what we have accepted or believed or what God has done for us all right Cain was speaking of the pointy of works and trying to make his religious uh appeasement to God by his daily works and we know those things won't work see it must be by faith all right but then when I preach I know people they hear me and they well he don't believe in living good no I believe in being born again then letting Christ Paul said the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God all right and that then uh The Works is supposed to be our faith expressed all right and somebody that's not living right but got a great Revelation you know right would just tell that person said you're just proving you're lost because if you're if your uh works is not comparative to your faith if the inward man is not coming out and living out then there's no inward man I mean that shouldn't have to be explained but see people say oh you don't believe in living good no I believe in being born again and then the life we live proves what side we're on you know right all right see then in doing that then we we got into Enoch being translated all right that he walked with God and he preached the gospel to the people remember we went through that he was a preacher and he preached the gospel to them speaking of the coming Messiah that Abel saw by Blood by Revelation that they would have to be and that's why brother around said Abel saw the seed of the woman he saw that he his speaking was of the coming Messiah all right Enoch could not speak of just something else then so as he built an ark see I mean as he walked off the Earth in his Revelation he was showing what it will do for you and I all right and we talked about the walk with God how do we walk with God we walk daily by the revealed word all right that way then we walk by faith Noah Enoch Abel all of them was speaking of our day see that we would be here in the end time and could look back at those things have you ever noticed brother Brandon will say I walked with Noah he said I walked with Abraham he said I walked with him and I was there with him he said I was there on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came well you know he wasn't back there but yet the faith that's within him the Revelation that was within brother brandom was what was back there see that's why he can speak of it brother Joe would show it me because you look it up and brother bradam would say that when Noah saw that Enoch was gone said he started building an ark well see that looks like that he's well he went up now start better start building AR there's hundreds of years between the two and see that way people try to make those things contradictory forms or something but I was telling brother Joe and I've tried to explain it to you do you believe let me just say it this way and we'll get this out of the way then I'll move on do you believe the day the time and the people in the days of Enoch believe that he walked off the Earth do you believe that no he just come up missing do you think that they believed even though he spoke of it even though maybe he said said I believe I'm just going to walk off the earth do you think anybody believed him no but the record was was made because that's the way they kept things right but see then Noah one day he says by Revelation seems something struck him and he said you know the story's been told it Enoch come up missing and you know they never have found his burial place you know what they say he spoke of walking off the Earth one day and said you know what I believe he did see that way Noah saw Enoch leaving do you understand not physically standing there looking at him disappearing that's why brother random will say and see uh Enoch was only 365 years old but brother Brown will say he walked with God for 500 years and we'll say well no he can't keep his story straight well he might as I said Wednesday night he might have had a better story than you think because he might have been talking that Enoch walked about aund and something years in God before he ever even started the world where was that at brother Dale it was in God's mind we might have been speaking from God's mind that Enoch walked 500 years see we want to get those things in our mind and fail to see the revelation we want to try to find the contradictory things instead of believing God's word what if it's 300 years or 500 years what if he'd say one day you know uh to Elijah that had 700 people 700 and well no we know it says 7,000 you know well he couldn't be a prophet ca he couldn't even keep that straight but you see we want to try to make those things as an excuse that we don't have to believe the other things that he said right see then he'd say if you find me wrong on one thing he said then you know that I'm wrong wrong always don't to that degree right see you can find him wrong anywhere you want to as far as what we think humanly but yet see to that is not so then like I said we're going to talk about Noah and Noah he it hits him you know Enoch wouldn't as crazy as we thought he was we thought he' just come up missing or maybe went to another country or sailed off somewhere else but said you know what he walked off the Earth cuz that was his message his message was that he was going to walk off the earth right what was his message his message was that Abel was right about speaking of the coming Messiah and that he would just walk off the earth because of that you see it's very simple when we get out of our own s and let God do the thinking it's like I was telling them yesterday about see educated people is the hardest thing in the world to deal with educated people and the worst educated person is a guy that's got a third grade education physically but yet he's got a college mind that's the hardest person to deal with there is anywhere do you say to me say brother Dale this message M brought to me one God that's all I believed in one God and I the Baptist Church how many of you believed in one God before you ever come in the message of the hour you thought you thought got a couple of hands when I said you thought but you see I can say the Baptist Doctrine is one God and say well what do you mean brother Brandon brought the Revelation one God we believed in one God see that's an educated idiot because that's where brother mol nailed me to the wall with it he said explain it I said the best I can do is God in three persons he said you're just as Trinity as anybody else if you got three person other personality is individual individual person bless God I saw one God for I ever heard of brother brandham I believe there something happened in the garden it was different than eating an apple before I ever heard of the Prophet learn Larin way before brother brandham thought it t horse rider was the Antichrist when brother brandham said was saying in his early Ministry that it was Jesus Christ you see what I'm talking about I'm trying to get you to think about things Noah got a revelation that Enoch was gone and God was dealing with him to build an ark and see to get prepared for him and his household all right well now let's pick up now remember what we're doing with taking these that have made a good report through faith and looking at the lives of the day that they were living and then coming down and bringing that down to where we're living all right will your sacrifice be as able sacrifice that spoke of the coming Messiah will your ability to walk in what you see today be like Enoch that walked off the Earth on the Revelation he had well I just don't believe he done that now that's just a little bit beyond well then that means you don't believe you can walk off the earth right now get my point we'll move on see Noah knew God was dealing with him to build an ark right gave him the dimensions we'll read gave him everything and he knew that that was of God but then in in the basis of all of that he could look back and see Enoch and Abel had spoke already ready of the things of God so we begin to preach the Judgment storm was coming now is that the way it ends up in the last days is it not true that we're supposed to have the faith of Abel to believe in the Messiah and then is it not true that the bride is supposed to walk off the earth in a rapture before the tribulation judgment strikes well we can look back there and see them and see our day and where we're living as an as an example and we can see it all right see knowing that it lays in order but then moving with it as we would move into Noah see we read where it says said what Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet there was no rain there were no storms there were nothing like that in the days of Noah The Fountains of the deep push the water up and all of the different things Tak place and you say well I just can't see that you go out there and lay a piece of plywood down on the ground and in the morning look underneath it and you'll find where the water's at right you're out in the desert and you need some water you hang up a piece of plastic close to the ground and it'll draw enough moisture in there until you can drink the water they're still doing it now that's what you call your water table at that time they didn't have rain out of the sky it was the water table all right so he knew knew that he understood what was taking place and he started speaking of a coming flood of rain and his brother around said they could shoot the stars and prove to him they would no water up there but they didn't read the Bible because it said the waters in the heavens and the waters on the earth it was there they just couldn't see it their scientific instruments would not record what was out there because it was not in a liquid form right I mean is is it liquid out there right now no when the cloud forms and when it goes through the chains and the thing then you start water falling out of the cloud it's not it's just a water's dir floating around and all at once it starts dropping it's got to go through chemical changes all right but now are you listening he prepared an ark to the saving of his house all right will our revelation of God provide an ark for the saving of our home right will it provide something for a family and like around and said it if you don't have enough faith for your family to be saved he said then I doubt you having enough faith for yourself well because there's only one Faith one Lord one baptism it's not not many things but see God spoke to no one said it's going to rain there's going to be a judgment come upon the world 120 20 years he preached that to the people all right at the time he was building an ark when you know in that day it was more scientific in today and they would have probably told us hey look you think a Titanic is something we'll build you a ship if that's what you want he said but God didn't tell me to build it out of metal he didn't tell me to do it out of this that or the other they were already tempering steel and metal there in Genesis because you read about uh musical instruments and all kind of things and in Genesis and just a very few years after the the fall they were already doing things right and then you get over to to the uh you know won't go through it but get over there to building the the the pyramids and the things they were able to do those things and you know what they was building a tower to go all the way up into heaven now if you think they could stack block on block to get up in the atmosphere now you need to think that over a little bit you know you need to upgrade your thinking what kind of tower was they building a spaceship Tower right you can't build a tower that can be seen around the world you can't Stack Rock on top of rock if you did you'd throw the world out of Gater I mean how about I what is it 93 million miles to the to the Moon isn't it or something like that a sun how many how far is it to the moon and how could you stack block on top of block that high do we need to get all that out of our mind mentally speaking and get down to the fact of what was taking place they had come to a One World Government because their language was one right and they had it going that they was going to build a rockets and I've told you before it wouldn't bother me what one word if they went back up to the moon and they stumbled on a spaceship that was there before the flood that wouldn't bother me none whatsoever I would say amen and to read before even heard of brother random of pyramids that had old waterwork systems in them and batteries and things back before the flood a scientific people right why they could tell Noah I said no it's not going to rain but you know what that didn't stop him and they can say no will supply I use the material we'll do all this he said no I'll take care of it myself men my boys is going to build an ark well in building that Ark he built a transportation piece for him and his family right which would speak of redemption right you remember it was in three layers you had the animals in this and animals in this and the top part was the human dwellings justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost which all of the speaking he was speaking of redemption he was a preacher of righteousness Enoch built the pyramids right which was a Bible in stone true then see see they were speaking of the coming Messiah Noah was speaking of the fact that God was going to provide a way to save people right all right then why can't we see that our day like I said will your Revelation provide you an Mark or are you living in the Ark of Safety but two will it provide it for your family now how many of you would if you had three boys and Daddy come in he says boys we're going to build an AR okay pop which Bridge Building Company we're going to get to do it and number one where we going to get the money to build it with and number two who's going to do the work right he say we're going to do it boys so then they must have believed him my point is did the boat save Noah's family physically preserved them took them up rote them over come back down but my point was or is did they finally catch on to the revelation of the their daddy had right see they got a revelation and they work day in and day out for 120 years listening to Daddy talk about what was going to happen don't you think as I said Noah could say look boys Enoch's gone I believe he walked off the earth now let's get to working on this Ark and the nastiest jobs of doing and working I don't say that that they had to do every piece of their material I don't say that they couldn't go down and buy some of it from some of the lumber companies that were were around them they got it somewhere but remember it's 120 years so they they might have cleared out a good bit of territory and then he pitched all that tar and stuff and man stinking you know they pitched it within and without stinking 120° and they're out there pouring Tower are you getting my point was it building the ark that saved his family or was it his family getting the Revelation that Daddy was right see now you're basing it upon what a prophet would say then if you can't believe for your family then I doubt you have faith for yourself but brother Dale you don't understand and my family okay go home get your kids and build an ark are you with me get your kids and tell them you're going to build an ark yeah you going crazy but you say kids look what I've got I can compare it with Enoch and I believe he walked off the earth I can compare it to Abel in his Revelation I can look at the things that's taken place and I'm seeing God come on there was God manifested upon a hill as we'd call it on Ark and everything that was placed within there like I said the layers the stories the things the windows in the top they claim some of them say it was actually built over on its side when it turned up you know they say it was built like a block it built I don't care what it's built like the main point was he built it according to God's specification certain size back in the Baptist Church I heard one day said boy that Ark was big enough for everybody in the world to get in it well you know what I've read one day then back to our that they was probably millions of people before the flood you know when my little old human brain didn't work too good how big of a b a boat would would it take to get a million people in Noah didn't know about nobody but his wife his three boys and their wives he didn't build the ark 40,000 ft long and 20,000 ft wide he build it according to what God God said you know what which would only hold his family he had four bedrooms the way it generally works out one bath right that's gener the way it is in our hom you know I always said if I had the money to build a house I would build a house and every room would have a bathroom it wouldn't matter what it is the only one I'd leave it out of is the kitchen right but every house room in the house have a bathroom in and then two extra in the hallway cuz no way do you ever have enough bathrooms all right make you shake thinking a little bit okay he built a four-bedroom Arc he buil it for just enough animals because God knew how many animals could be able to held and house within certain areas and he' build an areas for the clean animals and then he build areas for the other animals but he knew he was only going to take two of each one right see God didn't play because we talk about predestination that God knew that nobody wouldn't go to believe Noah his message nobody didn't believe Enoch come on you don't think like that they didn't believe Enoch walked off the Earth they didn't believe Abel that it was blood you know what Cain's lineages is no listing that ever changed to a blood sacrifice they kept right on with their works and their doings and their fruit their beautiful things and trying to appease God or Abel wasn't trying to appease God he answered God for what God wanted as a sacrifice are you listening noise boat then was their Arc of safety you ever heard brother around say it like this he said the water that destroyed the world was the same water that saved Noah right because it picked up the boat moved it if you went over and found the boat you know people will probably be surprised how big it was it would have to be more for the animals than the food CU they were almost a year in the ark floating they had to feed the animals and the things know but just get what I'm talking about Noah could tie what he had back to Enoch and also back to Abel that's what I'm trying to get you to follow and like I said I can take what God has revealed to me of one true and living God I can go back through the scriptures I can go back through L I can go back through Pentecost Wesley Luther Baptist Methodist Presbyterian and I can take the truth of each one of those and it'll tie together with my Revelation today it'll go all the way back to the book of Acts then it'll go all the way back to the Old Testament of all of those prophets and things that were speaking of the coming Messiah will yours do that do you can't take these doctrines of the message of the hour then and take them back through there that Jesus wouldn't go to the River Jordan how are you going to put that back in there and wind up with it being born Emmanuel God With Us you see what I'm talking about well you think you're the only one got to Revelation I'm the only one that I know of that's got it oh you're exalted no if you don't believe it that way then you got the problem problem right did the prophet say that if we believe there ain't but one person going who's that supposed to be right well I know brother bram's going I know you you can't believe it that way you got to believe it's you got it cuz God reveals himself to individuals right see Noah then as he did he provided an ark not just for himself he didn't build an ark with one bedroom right he built an ark with four bedrooms because he had faith for his family like I said we look at our families and say well I don't know I don't know whether they're going to be there or not I just see him keep on doing bad things well PR praise God cuz you know what somebody looked at you and seeing you doing bad things and wondered whether or not there was enough Faith to save you but of course we don't like it that way we think we're the Kingpin but just think about it God told Noah to build an ark make it a certain size make everything to go it's going to rain and judgment is going to strike the Earth and in doing that only those who will accept the message of Noah was going to be saved if that ain't predestination I don't know what is cu see God knew nobody else would want it do we built the ark a certain size all right by Faith by Revelation by God speaking to him God speaking to him and telling him build it so long so wide so high you know he probably had a lot of trouble getting his Revelation over his kids but you know they got it cuz they probably said Daddy we can do it this way he said no now boys remember God told me how to build it you got a better way yeah we can go down here and we can get us some metal and we could do this that and the other but said God didn't tell me that way now so the boys had to give up their own idea what do you say I've claimed my family kids grandkids great grandkids live long enough great great grandkids I've claimed them why because God told me to build an ark well you ain't started on it yet cuz we don't even have a pedal booat you but there's one thing about it the kids are sitting here some of the grandkids are sitting here and a great grandchild is sitting back there well you think your family's going to be saved because of you I have never taught that and never had any concept of that but I do have the concept of one thing God told me to build an ark for the saving of my household cuz he told me one day he said you'll be with there I was reading it in the Bible and said you'll be there with your Offspring well you know what I believe that why can't you believe it for your household yeah but your household never been like mine oh probably worse but are you listening to what I'm talking about taking back there but bringing it down to here see we talk about that Enoch walked with God we make that some kind of a uh uh special something that he was or a special way did he walk like I was talking you know did he did he limp did he do no he walked by faith my kids are not coming because they're my Offspring physically DNA makeup it's because I've claimed them well it don't look like they doing it well all right they ain't dead yet amen but the main thing is what Noah built a Ark you know really Noah was the ark you know you know I mean he was what the boys could look at and see in doing that then he saved his whole household you know what they wanted what he had it's what I've always said to you does your family want what you got and I've told you bluntly especially some of your older ones you need to go to apologize to your families the way you live before them I've always stood for this message and how did you stand with such a strong constitution of attitude till nobody could live according to your your ways and thinking and neither do you right come on no's revelation build an ark to saving his family what are you living before your kids you remember how I've always expressed it the reason those shearers ate up those 42 children was because it wasn't Mom and Daddy standing on the side of the road making fun of Elijah and say or Elisha saying go up old ballhead it was the kids well if they'd have been kids of any reputable form or beings they wouldn't have been doing that but you know what they were sitting at the table eating and Mama and Daddy was saying why don't know Elisha go up oh bald head and them kids just went out there and told them be careful what you say to your kids cuz remember they going to tell it like it is you going to try to explain right you going to say now Benny now V I didn't really mean what the kid told you that that I thought about you no the kids going to tell him what I thought about him right see it's our problem about our kids the reason and our kids don't want the message and we've made it a book of rules and I believe in living right you know that but we've made it a book of rules until the poor kids they're doomed and on their way to hell for they even breathe a breath of life right but yet we believe the message right we're facing coming up to Christmas and you know how I am about Christmas you want to put up a tree put it up you don't want to don't do it that's your business that's your home but I always tell you don't make fun of the other person that does because your Prophet put up a Christmas tree but see the that but but but I've heard preacher but but there's no way my Prophet didn't do that so they wind up putting brother brandom in another age you never heard that and explained that brother brandom was in another age we're in the bride age now and we're not to put up a Christmas tree well your messenger is not in the age with you so that means you ain't in the bride because you ain't got no messenger they just don't realize how carnal do you understand what I'm saying is the life that we're living the way that we do which is the worst mess garbage can of all but is it at least trying to bring Christ to our family and try to bring it in the correct way don't tell them kids don't try to make them afraid of Jesus Jesus don't like the way you do give them a weapon don't threaten them with a God that don't like them if you ain't got enough Bry on you to give them a spanking then you're not a good mom and daddy anyway well brother Dale we're in a day when we can't do that we just go ahead through kids lose let them live like the devil and you blame the government my kids out there own dope it's the government's fault they wouldn't let me Spike them uh okay the Noah told his kids about God the great God that had told him how to save them he built an ark for the saving of his household what about our Ark I said the other day that Enoch meant rest but really Noah means rest see Noah was a preacher of righteousness he said no was a preacher that's what said that he was a preacher of righteousness because there's never been a preacher now listen to what I'm saying there has never been a preacher called of God that was a law teacher W go do what you want to you show me that in the Bible when Noah was a preacher of righteousness even John Wesley understood that it was not all just in the bases of what we do and don't do read his writings even he had the Revelation the understanding of God being the savior show me any preacher that would tell you I ain't nothing but I'm just a straight law teacher boy I'm just straight then he has no hopes he's an old testament preacher and even in the Old Testament he has no hopes cuz Noah was a preacher of righteous you realize everything they done back Dar spoke of the coming of Jesus Christ that's what I'm trying to get us to see and we're in the hour when it's all to be made manifest in a group of people that we talk about is going to walk off the earth well that's the the time is at hand 1956 you want that he was a preacher of righteousness he condemned the world now but he saved his household was his condemning of the world and I know he did he preached against sodomites and things he did yeah but what was the main thing how did he walk with God because Genesis 6 and N the Bible says Noah walked with God that Noah walk with God I can see now that Enoch walked with God but Noah walked with God he kept building that Ark kept building that providing for his household preaching to the world trying to save them and you know what he was selling them now you you can get it in the right order they' say but Noah said look like your boat is not very big how's all the world going to get in it he said well then if all the world repents we won't have to have no flood right where do you need that at where can you find out well there was a man named who fell in the bar water and fish picked him up and and old Jonah goes over there and God's done told him he's getting ready to destroy that whole thing but you know what they repented and God didn't destroy now if you're preaching righteousness that's righteousness being preached see righteousness is when you tell people the truth because you remember how I told you go home and look up the definition of righteousness righteousness is not living a good life or doing righteousness is the fact of being right look it up it's the fact or state of being right Noah was right God Vindicated that Noah was right because he destroyed the world but had the world repented he wouldn't destroyed it like Wade was bringing out we'll get back to it on Abraham maybe Abraham was a man that was able to deal with God and God listened to him and he says if they 50 people down there you want to if it's 40 if it's 30 if it's 20 if there's 10 God said you find 10 I won't destroy it you see there wouldn't have been a flood had the people repented but they wouldn't repent he had to be the preacher of righteousness because when Jesus went and preached to those spirits that were in prison and watch what he said in the days of Noah is that the scripture Jesus went and preached to the spirit in prison that in the days of Noah would not repent it stipulates that you know why because they had a preacher of righteousness but yet he was building an ark and talking of a God that was not as a personal experience as it would be with Moses when we get to that at the burning bush that he walks into the I am that I am are the Abraham that walks into the great MDC why does it say in the days of Noah when it says that they repented not see and it says in the days of Noah that Jesus had to preach to those spirits that was in prison that in the days of Noah repented not because the building of an ark was a type then you get the bosom of Abraham in your Revelation and it's not the belly of Abraham it was the faith of Abraham that would provide a place to die for and Jesus didn't have to go preach to those that was in the bosom of Abraham he did but remember he didn't preach to them he went and preached to the one that was in the days of Noah that were disobedient come on he came back up and Abraham is the first one that meets him at the door come on come on is that the way your Prophet said it Abraham meets him at the door and says Sarah this is the one i' when we fed the cave to you see the witness became more personal amen whereas in the days of Noah was just looking at an ark it was looking at the things and you start dealing with looking at a person we'll get to that more as we go along but just think about it see they had to be a Noah he said well Enoch typed the bride in the Rapture and Noah types the tribulation s that's good but he also typed the Jews would you like to read that one you can go ahead and pull it up I'll quote it to them but it's off with 397 no wait a minute I didn't even give him that 397 revelation of Jesus Christ he represented the Jews they probably got it in Noah was the top of the Jews there you go he was the top of the Jews where would you bring the Jews into it see we only talk about Enoch as being the top of the Bride that's all we want to talk about but there's a lot more than just foolish virgins that go with it there's the Israel the the Jews that we'll get to the Lord willing some this afternoon if we can Noah type the Jews because they're not in the body of Christ now you're talking about a whole as a nation and things not meaning that there are not Jews born into the body of Christ because that's why we're in a gentile dispensation which means anybody can come in all right but are you listening to what I'm saying even even though Noah was not a typ of the Bride in the bases of what he's typing but he is the type of the Jews and the others that will be saved all right so then when he provided a house for his family Noah could speak of a house being made or a way being made for the Jews to come in for the foolish virgins to come in because he walk with God Genesis 6 and9 you remember what we were talking about and been talking about how do you walk with God how do you walk with god well I'm just so good I've just been so good until God loves to walk with me I thought that our righteousness was as filthy rags I thought that's what the word said so does God walk with us because of the goodness of Our Lives or does he walk with us because of the Revelation that we're able to receive and believe when that others that are more righteous in their lives are turned down you remember Jesus the man I've fasted I've done everything I've done and I'm not like that guy over there the man over there said Lord just forgive me Jesus was asking which one of them went home Justified the one that was repentant not the guy with the good works now okay don't go wrong on me works is supposed to follow your faith so if you tell me you have a great faith but yet you're out in The Honky ton Living For The Devil then don't tell me you're a Christian soor am too old I remember years ago that there was a a strip lady that was a stripper and everybody went to see the stripper and then she'd go talk to them about the Lord oh that was a great Christian she was a Christian you a you going to say she wasn't a Christian yeah yeah you need anything else yeah but you don't know her heart I don't have to I see too much right oh but we'll go down to we'll go down to the beer joint and we'll go in and talk to them about the Lord be careful make sure the Lord sent you all right might be a rare occasion something might happen but this make sure he sent you but you're not going to go in there drinking and carousing with them and then try to win them to the Lord don't sorry forget it Noah walked with God it says and you know what is it the fact that he had a different kind of walk than Enoch had no Noah walked with God and the what it please God they got that one up six and N Noah Walk With God all right what kind of a walk is it a good life okay we're supposed to be that way that's expected but he told Abraham or Abram really walk before me and be thou perfect you can pull the rest of these scriptures up one at a time if you want to James 2 and 23 he's called a friend of God my point what we just look at Enoch pleased god with Rapture and faith and we try to make that some form of something as a different individual or part just remember these others have the parts too Noah walked with God Abraham walked with God job what one and8 Satan have you considered my servant job there's none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that fearth God in youth evil don't you think he walked With God all right what about David acts 13 and 23 said David was a man after my own heart orer adultery murderer dirty stinking Rascal was God's heart that away no David had a repentant heart read your scripture I love that even Scofield knows it Scofield says that David on his way home from the bed of basba Cries Out restore unto me the joy of thy salvation amen what did he say tired of your no your stink is becoming your your offerings are become a stink in my nostrils but an honest and a contrite heart so David walked before God Israel walks before God according to Zechariah 2:8 and they're the apple of his eye of David it speaks in Psalms I think it's 12 and 8 I got BR down here and then race out part of it he was the apple of God's eye Malachi 2 4-6 speaks of Levi walking before God a covenant with him of life and peace he feared me he was afraid before my name the law of Truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many away from iniquity these people walk with God do we walk with God in our Revelation what about the last one look at number 12 perfect faith my brother R saids I'm pleased to make my Abode in here this is my beloved Son and pleased to dwell talking about the Lord Jesus I'm pleased to make my boat in here there's no condemnation to him at all now when the same God comes to you and is pleased to dwell in you pleased to honor your word what your decision is you mean to say that brother brandom would believe that a human being could change God's mind do you believe in a God that will change his mind according to your ways and your desires not changing the bases that he don't know you're going to do it cuz he knows he's going to do that anyway but he's waiting on you to ask for it you remember who was it Hezekiah was that his name which one was it asked God for 15 years and he got it oh all we want to talk about is that he would have been better off had he died right there and that's true because he caused Israel to sin of great sins in them but still you know what God listened to it please to honor your word what your decision is what was Joshua's decision stand still son and it stood there is he pleased to honor your word your decision well then then what I'm going to do is I'm going to pray for God to change his mind no no that's not what we're talking about Noah was told to build an ark he could have went home and sat down and said God if you want an ark you build it yourself speak it into existence no he went out every day he got up and he worked himself to death for 120 years and all the time that anybody would come by he'd say have you heard about Jesus no no no no no no brother no it didn't come on he'd say have you heard about God and what God's going to do he's going to destroy this bunch of junk out here but he's told me that all that believe it will be saved he was a preacher of righteousness his message condemned the world what about our message do we have enough faith for our own kids you know for our kids why can't we yeah and I know what it is you I know what you say but brother Dale every time I pray for my kids it gets worse what are you going to do stop praying come on when it gets worse you keep on praying June can tell you I told her one day I said every time I look at Wade and see what he's doing I life not life because of being silly or what I said but what he's going to have to go through because as far as I'm concerned it's already settled well brother Dale what if Wade would have died before he come to the lord well then I know for certain it wasn't the Lord that told me what if Noah had got the ark ready and it didn't rain in another 120 years he's sitting there waiting I'll tell you some good ones we ought to get into the book of Noah and talk about him you know that Noah told them people tomorrow is going to rain and you know he got in the ark and it didn't rain for seven days eight days is that what you're saying seven days I know you know his kids even as brother Brown said come around and said Daddy are you sure you told us it going to rain that first day we come in here it ain't rained yet he said it will rain but you know what at that time now listen what I'm talking about at that time the day they walked in the ark it wasn't seven days later that the door was closed by the Lord the day they walked in the ark that day God closed the door there wasn't nobody body going out it was done settled it was done finished it was over with nobody was coming in and nobody was going out so even though the kids could doubt Daddy he said it's going to rain seven days he sat there it's going to rain but don't you think that it it ought to be raining by now oh it's hot in here man they're out there throwing Rotten Tomatoes at the side of this place making fun of it he said God told me it's going to rain then we got to wait 120 more years it's going to rain we got enough food in here to take care of us had enough food in there to take care of for a year or twoo and it you see what I'm talking about it looks like even God turned against Noah because Noah said God told me it's going to rain tomorrow sometimes God wants to try our faith to see if we really believe it right you claim your family and it starts getting worse and then you start doubting oh Lord and yours the worst one you turn your kids over to the Lord and they start getting sick and you said Lord I didn't mean it that way right come on is that right that's right I didn't mean for it to go that bad I quit praying for him cu the more I pray the worse it gets I had to overcome that I'll tell you a personal point one of the musicians is coming I'll tell you a personal point that used to happen I used to walk in the room where people were sick and try to pray for them and every time I'd walk into that room and try to pray for them they'd get worse they get worse I'm tell you a personal thing I finally come to the conclusion that I would stand outside the room and let other people go in I did because it seemed like I was causing the problem seemed like my presence in that room I'm telling you I went through a long period of time with this and it bothered me and I wouldn't go pray for people I say Brothers y'all go pray I'll stand out here and pray I didn't tell nobody thought he wouldn't understood it anyway and I cried unto God about it God what's wrong every time I enter that room they get sick the kids would be real violently be sick and I'd be in the other room I'd go in that room and they'd start vomiting they'd start all kind of time that's oh God am I a demon you know am I the one that's causing them to get worse and one day he reminded me of a scripture and you remember it looks kind of like in the Bible that who was it that Elijah that built the you know laid out the order put everything in order and then you said now the god that answers by fire let him come you know brother Woodby made a statement one day about it and it hit me and from there it opened up a door do you know that those people was challenging Elijah it wasn't Elijah challenging them I've read it in the Bible where he says you do this they challenged him he accepted the challenge come on they were the ones that was in the wrong they challenged Elijah and Elijah said I accept now you go build your place and I'll build mine so you don't have to worry about the challenging the devil's going to challenge you anytime you try to move he's going to challenge you it may not be I I challenge you no no no if it hadn't been for those people Elijah would have never had to said what he said so they were the one to trouble and that's what the Lord spoke to me he said just like it was with Elijah said they challenged Elijah he said when you enter that room those demons is challenging you and have faith step in and call for it I stepped into the room and I've never failed since then I made one failure just recently that I blame myself ran tried to give me that baby when it was born he said here brother Dale I'm kind of shy about babies and things I just always been that way they're they're precious and I don't want to break them you know you might drop them Ryan said here brother Dale you want to hold her I said no I won't do it and I walked out of of that room it went down I've cried and prayed ever since then it's back now well why would you even tell that because it's the truth I failed see and I took that baby I believe today had I took that baby in my arms and blessed it there would have been no demon would have been able to come on it when I walked out of that room and walked down the hallway I said Lord I've messed up have to wait an hour or two immediately I said I've messed up Lord and you take over and you bring that child out of this condition go at that time we didn't know there was any condition to be well he's done it see when the Lord speaks to you go do it immediately don't wait because you can get in trouble by not speaking and doing he tells you to go pray for somebody go pray for them right but you see folks God's waiting on you and I what's your answer what's your decision what are you asking well when you asked why don't you believe what you're asking for why don't you say that's mine and believe it Noah build an ark for the saving of his household what is your revelation will it save your family now you think it's C it's your kids I've got to explaining that but you know what that is my Offspring and why don't I claim them CU you know how you claim them more than anything what is our way of dedicating a baby bring the baby up we hold it up we give it back to the Lord then we turn around to the congregation and everybody in the building is commanded to live before that child if you go out and live like the devil then you're denying that you stood here to try to or was witnessing it that child to be of God understand think on these things no build an heart go ahead brother 124 in spir book anybody have a need I am weak but thou strong Jesus keep me from all be satisfied as Lord as I walk let me walk
