TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's on it so we're gonna try to finish up today don't start something else and if this works well we may go back through some other like major doctrinal stuff that we went through we'll see but if you got your Bible let's turn to Isaiah 65 because we've left one we left one piece of the puzzle out all right last Sunday week Isaiah 65 thank you we left we left one element out because last Sunday we proved by the message and by the uh Bible that it took one week of of Messiah Ministry to get us an interact with one week of Messiah Ministry to get the Jews in a rapture and it's going to take a one week Ministry to the Earth to get the Earth redeemed right gotta have all three all right and remember we go ahead of the earth we go justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the earth goes through a justification went through a justification under Noah when he baptized the Earth with water in the flood and then when Jesus Christ came on the earth he Sanctified it with his blood while his blood was dropping on the Earth you and I our bodies were in the Earth right so we sanctify the people and then it's waiting a baptism by fire right because we look and see that that in the Scripture it says Holy Ghost and Fire see God gives you the holy ghost at the new birth but one day he's going to burn you completely so much to where that the part that Mom and Daddy brought here is going to be changed back into an original creation all right or what that theophany looks like which is you so that's this Earth but this Earth down here has got to go through it too it's already went through justification already went through sanctification and the prophet said our body goes first and then read the future home then the world natural comes behind all right because the Earth was in a fallen condition if you read there in Romans we talk about the whole creation growth and travaleth waiting on what you and I to manifest ourselves so that the Earth can manifest itself because we're the ones that fell and then everything behind us all creation fell behind us and it's going to take whatever like we were talking about here the fall the fall what redeems us back is the same thing that the Jews fell from From Grace With God divorced her took a gentile bride takes her in the Rapture and then he's going to take this 144 thousand twelve thousand tribes 12 000 from each tribe 12 12 144. ain't gonna take them in a rapture after this three and a half years are 1260 days of Daniel 70 weeks that's prophesied in Revelations 11. but according to the Bible we've only accomplished 483 years to the birth of Christ I mean from the death of Christ excuse me for an 83 years Jesus said how many times do you forgive her brother well that's he's talking about you and he's talking about this Earth because this Earth's got to be forgiven too because it fell and I believe somewhere else in Isaiah I've been looking for it but I couldn't find it maybe we'll find it in a minute where God said I made this Earth to be inhabited and until a prophet came we all thought we were going to heaven somewhere off live on a cloud live in heaven go up come to find out we're going to go up for a little while God's going to clean this thing off and we're going to come right back down all right and live here this is where Heaven's going to be right okay so we miss those things let's let me go back maybe I can find it because I have it done right here turn right to it Isaiah 45 now is this not the word of God and it will live Eternal right Isaiah 45 Isaiah 45. verse 18. that's 317. this is going to tell but Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation you shall be ashamed nor confounded shall not be ashamed nor confounded World Without End ah listen to this for thus saith the Lord that created the Heaven God himself that formed the Earth and made it he has established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited so brother Joe there's no doubt in my mind the Earth was made to be inhabited eternally right right I am the lord and there is none else okay that's enough right there all right now let's go back to Isaiah 65. all right for just a minute let's look at the chart so now we see that it was 483 years a 62 week period and a seven week period brother Brown said there's three periods a seven week at 62 and a seven or one week I mean I'm sorry a seven week a 62 week in one week three periods 62 plus 7 is 69 and one more make 70. all right Jesus said in Matthew we read it last Sunday how many times do you forgive her brother he said 70 times 7 which is what 490 483 years already been accomplished so there's one week left after the Rapture or seven years all right for the rest of this to culminate not to say that that the uh tribulation period is not seven years um Jesus didn't through two prophets doesn't preach for seven years there's only three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ left to be preached on the earth to take them in a Rapture but there's time left to come to this 490 and the Bible even says in Daniel blessed is those that live to be in the 1300 and something weak or 1300 something days that's 1260. blessed is the one that make it through all right now we'll see because remember during this time the foolish version is going to be hunted down and killed the battle of Armageddon is coming in here right in here and then there'll be a millennium Temple set up according to Ezekiel 42 44 somewhere after the Rapture of those Jews brother random said the two prophets to Israel were the Sixth Seal what is the six seal destruction they call down fire earthquakes Islands will be taken out of their place I believe the scripture even says that everything on top side of the earth will be shook even the heavens will be shook this time all right what God is doing is is he's showing that this thing's coming back to original right right where where man destroyed the world by flood or brother Brown said it could have been an atomic explosion I believe so where it shifted or Tilted the world over and it's going to bring that world right back and then we'll go back to what we'll go back to those prophetic days 30 days 30 days because we're going to read here God's not going to do away with the moon and the sun right and all those things he just said here that he created all this to be inhabited he created I believe that everything that God created originally was eternal yeah in the mind of God what Adam done is he forfeited the ability to bring it all to pass by doing what he did but doing what he did saved a lot more people all right foolish virgins and all the Jews and all those things like that now we see how it come into into big but we've got to get us into the millennium to build this Temple so let's read Isaiah 65 and let's start with verse 16. that he who blesseth himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth he that sweareth in the Earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hidden from mine eyes for behold I create now listen that creates you and many times people say I create new Heaven and you work that's where everybody got the idea that God was just going to blow this one up and just build a whole new one we read in Isaiah that he wasn't going to do that he was just going to burn it off then the prophet comes in invisible oh Not Invisible Union but in um the future home and tells us that it'll be burnt off all right renew it right you renew it right because you and I when we're born again God didn't just kill this human you're looking at and raise up a new one he took what was already created and made it on you all right burn it off burn all the sin out of all the drops and all that while I'm still alive right here all right because he said I'll take my spirit and put it in your heart see he gives you a new spirit of sanctification which many people claim that as the holy spirit because it changes their attitude instead of their whole being all right but when you're born again what does it do God comes down and burns out the sin in your soul still got this old guy that does the center outside right same way with the Earth he came on the Earth he's always been here but look at all the sin look at all the things that that's going on and let's read for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth you notice a key there I create new heavens and he didn't say a new Earths right there's only one Earth okay there's many Heavens there's all the nebulas and all that I believe their solar system but there's only one Earth one Earth behold I create new heavens and a new Earth all right and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be glad I'm enjoy us forever and that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem or endorsing and her people with joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and join my people and the voice of the Weeping shall be no more hurting her another voice of crying there should be no no more fence in infinite days nor old man that has not filled this day the child shall die 100 years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be a curse and they shall build houses and inhabit them now some of these things you can put into the future home some of them you cannot because we don't build houses in the future home Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you brother random said that's the difference between the Millennium and the future home your future home he's already built the house according to your desire right but this is that they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build in another and have it that means I built my you know Daddy builds a house and then when he passes away I get it and then when I pass away the son gets it that's not going to happen here because you're not going to die right they shall not build in an oven habit they shall not plant in another eat whereas the days of a tree of the days of my people in my election long enjoy the works of their hands all right they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offsprings with them there's the promise and it shall come to class that before they call I will answer them while they are yet speaking I will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat strong like the bullet and thus shall be the Serpent's meeting they shall not hurt nor destroy at all my Holy Mountain saith the Lord all right so there's a millennium coming the 70 weeks of Daniel when it Blends into the millennium it has brought the Earth to not a total restoration but remember you got justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you got the holy ghost coming with fire Holy Ghost and Fire right because you and I received the Holy Ghost but we're not changed we're changed on the inside but this guy's still dying all right the Earth was changed it's changed here in the millennium but according to everything else it's still dying because the devil's still alive the devil's still here they're still evil but not where we're going to be the evil will be suppressed but the Bible said let's go over now and let's see where the Holy Ghost that's the type here of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Millennium is right because they're still sin baptism of the Holy Ghost half of the Millennium because it going to this day but it's restored the Earth It's Beginning a process to bring everything back all right but let's read now where the fire comes in over in Revelation chapter 20. well let's just read now because what's going to happen that 490 God's going to forgive this Earth he's going to wipe it off by man's fire this is going to be a nuclear Holocaust and it's going to blow everything up everything's going to be remembering Malachi 4 says we would walk out on the ashes of the wicked all right so everything's going to be turned to Ash all right and then everything in a thousand years is going to do like the Garden of Eden is going to just grow right back up all right what great fertilizer that's right then then people and animals and it's what you're putting in your gas tank now from the flood and all those plates turned upside down matched all the vegetation in the people in the dinosaurs and the cars and the buildings and whatever was before the flood maxed all that down and that's why out in the Gulf of Mexico that's why that oil is coming up because they made a hole and all that stuff coming back out of the ground and it's dead people they say all plants and animals and well yeah and people were there too Jehovah Witnesses one time when they came to the house they were talking about heaven and the fact that we were going to walk out in the ashes of the wicked and I said you know the Lord showed me something this week I said where are all those Wicked people they're not up there somewhere they're right here on Earth because they think they're going right exactly yeah I think they're all going to come up yeah but we'll walk out and we'll be able to build and inhabit our own home this is not the future home coming down with the mountain pushing up and the gold streets of gold that's not the Millennium all right does everybody understand that we may go through that maybe and maybe clarify that since our mind's fresh on it we may go through that maybe in the next couple weeks so and clarify that but here in Revelations Watch What Happens here chapter 20. now saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him in the bottom of the spin and shut him up and set a seal upon him that should deceive the Nations no more excuse me until a thousand years should be before excuse me to fulfill and after that he must be loose a little season now here's his loosing think now John stops said I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them I saw Thrones and they which is going to be us sat upon them and Jacob was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that would be headed for the witness of Jesus for the word of God which are not worship the Beast and our damage neither received the mark on his head let's stop right there but no it's going to verse five just the same time excuse me but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection so all the people is going to die here at Armageddon is going to have to stay dead for that thousand years then they're going to come up in a white Throne judgment all right now listen to verse 7. this brings into being this is the Fire part okay the Earth is already going through her change in the Millennium right the devil's being suppressed they're still demons but they're not in us or around us they're all suppressed brother Brown said that chain was not a log chain it was a chain of circumstances there's nobody gonna be able to uh hey if we all had wonderful thoughts today that would defeat a lot of the devil just right now if we just cast everything away and not do that you know not be healed against our brother or our sister right that would do a lot of that what's going to happen in in the Millennium is that we're going to be see we're going to be in our full estate right here Bonnie spirit and so we're going to be Eternal right I believe the same thing for the 144 000. now and the ones that come back in this resurrection that died in here but you got a lot of people that died in here that I don't know about that's something another subject to get into but they're all going to have to stay dead the only people is going to be alive in the millenniums as far as I know for a fact is you and I are the bride the 144 000 and Jesus Christ himself right that's all that I know you understand what I'm saying because there are brother Reynolds talks about heathen being raised up in the Millennium that we preach the gospel to now maybe we'll get a little further deep into that but it says right here it says the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished okay but see after that Thousand Years the devil's going to be loosed for a season now one is a season we're Eternal season could be another Thousand Years wow but I don't believe it will be I just believe it'll be a time and what they're going to do is it's right here verse 7. and when a thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four corners of the Earth that had to come from somewhere and he had to be able to work through them and not us it can't work through us right Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle in the number of whom is the Sands of the sea and they went up on the breath of the earth and can pass the camp of the Saints about and the Beloved City and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them and they killed him and said devour them okay so there's your Holy Ghost all right here's your justification sanctification when Jesus died at the cross your baptism of the Holy Ghost into the millennium because what we're talking about we're talking about Redemption three stages of redemption but brother Brandon remember there was four bugs that eat it down four bugs you got to bring or four Messengers got to bring back to their life messages justification sanctification back to the Holy Ghost and the word which is your justification certification baptism the Holy Ghost and Fire what's going to clean us up the fire that proceeds out of the mouth of God and the scripture is not a sword he said a flaming sword it's not a literal sword it's what the word of God right right so the word of God is a consuming fire and watch what's going to happen with this Gog and Magog we're going to come to the end of the Millennium white Throne judgment whatever you want you know we'll put all that in perspective but what's going to happen is is that fire is going to consume our devour those evil spirits and then what happens excuse me verse 21. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth now come from heavens to heaven all the dimensions are coming together because you can say to people in the sixth Dimension are in a half yeah right so there's Dimensions right all right chapter 21 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth will pass away and there were no more Seas right and I saw John the holy sit and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven so what's going to happen after the Thousand Years this is what I believe God's Gonna burn this thing off again with a holy fire kill all the devils right well the Devils didn't get killed right here at the battle of Armageddon that just pushed him down under in another dimension so that they can't bother us then they're going to be able to raise back up but what's going to happen in this fire that's coming this is God's fire fire came down from God right out of heaven and devoured them so we're not going to see these no more and the devil that deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire Brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are in other words they're going to get theirs first all right and Shelby told me today and not forever and ever and then he sees a white Throne judgment coming out with books then here you got John saw the holy city and you Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven preparing as a bride and the Lord for a husband what John stall was the city with us coming down and settling on a mountain brother Brown proves what that mountain was remember it pushes up it's 1500 Miles Square at an angle a pyramid angle pyramid mountain and we're going to live on that because there's no way the Bible says you can see him day and night you can see the light of the Lamb which is I mean from here to it's 900 miles from here to Bartlesville I know that because we've been there before but you take another 600 miles past that and it's an incline from here to there well if you can see forever you can see that far that's not a problem right but it's almost a whole almost compassion to hold the United States as far as a square so it's going to be where we can see the lamb is the light because it tells you here in down in the verse verse 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it but the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb was lighting up somewhere in there to save time it tells you that it'll always be seen that way even if you had a wall the walls are going to be like 200 feet high Ivory and all these stones and Jasper and Jasmine and Burl and Onyx and all that he said man that's you can't see nothing but if it's in an incline you can stand outside the city and look up and you can see the top of the mountain always anywhere you go right and it's going to be in Jerusalem well see now now what's going to happen let's go back to verse three and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men now why didn't he say that at the millennium it is in the bride but they still other people that's got to come in and be giving eternal life and to watch their own judgment so Redemption is not complete until the Battle of God and Magog all those demons are killed now and you're either going to be a sheep or a goat right everybody understand that we'll go let's go we'll do that maybe next next week or so we'll go over the uh the difference in the Millennium and a future home and take it maybe step by step but in the millennium and I don't and I don't understand where it says an old man will live 900 and Center will die 100 years old and a young child will not die and all those things maybe we'll get in and see what the prophet said about it all right I just know one thing for sure during the Millennium there's still going to be a devil somewhere right but when we get in that future home they won't be no demons right right there won't be nothing but pure holy good because he said I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them excuse me be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death nor sorrow no crying you know he didn't pronounce it being no more deaf talking about the millennium because somebody's gonna die at the end of that Millennium all those demons are at least they're gonna die right they're real people as we're real as we are and God's got to kill them that's why he's got to kill this thing with fire to take it to Rapture because if you don't get this kill with fire you got to go by the grave and that's your fiery grave that you got to come back up through the Earth to get your body same body but to get your theophany back into your body that you're living in all right now do away with it he didn't do away with the Earth remember he cleaned it and he still hadn't done away with him with a future homecoming down but he burnt that thing off with Holy Fire where there is no there's no mention of the devil anymore all right after this and he that sat upon the throne I'm sorry there should be no more death nor sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am out when Amiga the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the verse of The Fountains of Water of Life freelance he that overcometh shall inherit all things and come down to the church ages seven times it tells about that it tells those who have overcome I'll give this and give this well see this is number eight that puts you into eternity Aid is always eternity seven is still Millennium you're still in seven sevens is 49 7s seven means completion but not eternity right right but when you get into that Eighth Day you're complete the 50. that's what brother Brown saw when he preached a future home he said oh brother Brown you run out of your types you got sevens you got sevens you got seven took them back to Leviticus and showed them where there was an eighth day a holy convocation and that's what we're talking about right now the holy this is the holy convocation that all creatures are looking for because everything's restored back foolish virgins giving eternal life a cup of water my name's been given eternal life Old Testament Saints or eternal we're we're Eternal before that 144 000 but everything else catches up through the Millennium just like you were the Holy Ghost she was born again with the Holy Ghost maybe 15 years ago did you understand the message no not all of them what you grew just like this in this Millennial we're going to grow in great we're not yes the Earth is because the Earth is we're already out here and the Earth is moving toward that time okay all right so it's moving but all's been forgiven when we start into that Millennium as far as because remember the 70 weeks was to Daniel and his people and the City okay so New Jerusalem is going to be the temple is going to be rebuilt but this is New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven has nothing to do with this but we got to go through this to get there all right so does the Earth right the Earth just follows the Earth is catching up it is done I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give them to him that it thirsts The Fountains of water blind freely either it overcome it shall inherit all things and I will be his gun and he shall be my son fearful and unbelieving and abominable murders more mongers remember look what they happened to them the second death and watch your own judgment that fiery death they're going to be done away with right now anybody have any questions our comments I think first you already have one you got another one I always thought that when the devil was loose first season that that was the Judgment am I wrong about that because what's going to happen is it's gonna happen something we're in their clothes when the devil's loose brother Brown if you'll read in the future home he says he brings his army up against us that are hearing a millennium all right and then we'll get into it and read it because I knew there'd be some questions about it so we'll go into it maybe next Sunday but what's going to happen is he's going to raise up with a group and try to overthrow us because the devil still thinks he can he can handle us you know he just he still thinks he can he can do it you say well how can he do that and let's be Eternal he's still fighting God and he knows God's Eternal right he knows God created it uh he ought to be the one that knows it because that's the one that created it he just forgot but then you raise up after the Millennium and then brother random said all the saints will be brought off the Earth in other words put in another dimension and God's just going to wipe it off now what does it matter if the if the white Throne judgment's right in there somewhere that's fine that's okay where he burns it off and then then they're they're there no more but there's got to be a white Throne judgment whether it's done at dog and Magog I don't know where it says she raised our hands you gotta raise your hand I'll have my hand back okay I can't see that okay I was wondering about the not having no need of Sun or the moon that's not going to get rid of it no it says we won't need he said the city won't need it right outside I believe it's going to be daylight and dark right they like dark moon stars God's not going to do away with anything he created he's just gonna bring it right back to the original I was thinking in the city there will be no need of light because that whole hey it's going to be transparent gold and if we're glowing man gold glows when it you know when the when the light hits it so we're not gonna have to worry about that because it says you won't need it didn't say it be done away with he said you won't need it in the city we just don't know outside that City they couldn't I just don't think everything's going to be plastic like little flowers and it's never going to grow it's just going to stand in one place I just don't believe that I just don't believe that God's so um put these where we had seeds and we got garden and we got things like that he put Adam in an eternal condition he put Adam in the Garden of Eden to do what heals us all right I mean Adam wasn't Eternal yet but God was getting ready to put him in that condition the Earth was perfect in that Garden of Eden and he said there's no man here to tell the song right so he put Adam in human flesh so he could and I mean it wasn't by the sweat of his brow yet right I don't believe Adam sweat because now God said in Genesis he said now you'll work the rest of your life about a sweat of your brow to raise up your children and and you know take life and all that yeah God created everything a lot of people sure didn't I believe they'll plant trees and grow and not inside the city the Bible says there'll be a tree of life and that uh Kings will come into the city right and take a leaf for the healing of the nations take it back out now if that tree didn't grow eventually during eternity somewhere they're gonna pick that tree down to nothing it's well matters of fruit seed you're going to have we're gonna be able to eat we just won't have to explain that League it doesn't matter to me it's all for the it's for the Nations for the Kings right ain't got nothing to do with the bride ain't got nothing to do with us all right it's just there for God to um I guess as an example because what did Rome used to do Rome used to do that when they go out and Conquer they'd send gifts or they'd send uh leave you saw those things that go around the the hands of the of the uh Caesars and all those you know they had the little I can't remember what the name of those leaves are but that was because they had conquered somewhere and they was given that lead for our flower or whatever so that'll just be to show that that there won't be any more war there won't be anything going on because the people on the outside I don't know that they're going to live different than you and I but I don't see how God can make us Sons and Daughters of God give us all the promises in this Bible and then give that guy that changed your tire one day that never even thought God was nothing and God said hey I'm giving you eternal life right his somewhere in his knowledge of thinking he's going to have to be lower than you not saying lower as far as being a like illiterate like we are but it surely it would be illiterate because illiterate's not bad litterness just means you don't know they don't know anything about God and here you've got a group of people us can walk outside that City see they can come in the city but they can't stay we'll get into all that but they have to go back out but we can go out and sit down under a tree one day and just teach them about God teach them about all this you know oh that's just going now so we need to go then next Sunday and all of you that are dating I mean that's going to the uh um camping trip
