it was coming from a rig that brother Joe had placed in there well I didn't know we put it in there and I thought well who in the world trying to bug the house if they want to know anything just call

everybody's prayers and Teran t e h r a n which is Iran but we appreciate God for for doing that all right Psalms 118 We Begin verse 20 verse 19 oh open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord unto which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee now remember it's a gate it's an opening a way to enter there in all right you'll find out later while we keep reading this same scripture because it has everything in it that we want to cover in the series that we're trying to to do all right I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord all right let's go over to 1 John 2 we just use verse 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking for quite a while this is message number nine on the coming of the Lord now as one believer in the Bible I believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ right now I don't believe it like we used to believe it but uh you know you know we used to be Tau that there'd be something out in the Eastern Skies would split and we'd hear a great big too too you know and the Lord would come down and the dead would be raised and you'd know he's doing that because all the graves be open and airplanes be crashing out of the Skies called the pilot went to Rapture you know different things you know we we used to to believe all of those things but through the opening of the word we come to find out that those things are not necessarily uh true uh we were doing the best we could do right but now through the the end time with the prophet's message and all uh we should be able to talk about the coming of the Lord in a greater manner or way than ever before because of him speaking to us the things of God right now I preached our last Wednesday on a message and I titled it um let's see something I forgot how I even titled it but anyhow it's the coming of the Lord but I want to make sure you get that tonight I want to make sure because I don't want us to make miss this point I believe if we miss this point we will miss uh the rest of it as we try to go along but now I've been speaking as I said about the second coming of Jesus Christ right now in the second coming of Jesus Christ I've given it to you over and over uh where the Prophet said the second coming of Jesus Christ would be the bride coming of Christ right right coming out of the church all right now so that's the second coming of Jesus Christ and we know for assurity that the prophet taught us that he will not set foot on Earth in this coming you know physically be here on Earth as a being so that does away from what we used to think about the sky of splitting and all of the things that would happen you know and all so then and we know that the second coming of Jesus Christ as I said last Wednesday has got to be covered in three stages or phases or whatever you want to call it I don't have the education but um not much sense but I do know that if you cross up the scriptures or the prophet's message then if you mislocate it you know misinterpret it Etc miss you you're going to miss the whole thing so in the second coming of Jesus Christ you got to cover the bride coming to Christ right coming out of the Church you got to cover the two witnesses going to Israel right and 144,000 receiving Christ right and still that will not be a physical uh mortal being standing there it'll be through the two witnesses all right then it goes on over and the prophet said that Jesus does not come back to earth until the Millennium so then in the Millennium would be finishing up the second coming which would would cover and not only will we be there but the 144,000 will also be there so it's all related to the to the same thing but that's what we've been trying to get you to see but if you cross up your scriptures see and and you say well well look at there it says the Lord's coming and and even to the Jews you know the 144,000 it says they'll say where did you get the nail prints in your hand well what do you mean the god out nail prints show them to them you know see and that's what we think we have it all figured out in our understanding but then we find out that the Corporal body of Jesus Christ does not come back that way all right see then in the second coming we're looking for some kind of a second coming you know something to come down right like that all right and I gave it to you I don't think you have them tonight in your notes but we'll be glad to show them to you page what is it 208 is that the one I gave him last week or 308 of the seal book where brother R said the second coming of Jesus Christ The Rapture right because we meet him in the air he doesn't come here physically right we meet him in the air all right now that's tying together all the scriptures see then in that way then looking at the second coming it's not looking looking for something to up there that's coming down here that way right see it's looking at it as a scriptural lineup of the truth to see that uh you know then we we look at it to see what what is his second coming and as I said the prophet said it's the bride coming to Christ right amen coming out of the church what is the rapture going to do to you and I what is this message supposed to do to you and I get us out of the church amen that's right all right get us out of our ideas well I never was brother Dale I never went to a church well you're just as bad as anybody else cuz we were all born that way right that's the human mind that's what the prophet is talking about not because you as brother Mo you say you can get your coat and hat and leave a church and go to another church what good have you done right but if it's not a coming out then where are we all right so now we read then and try to use that for a background I'm sorry that to try to these that are here but to try to move on because I don't like to keep backing up so much uh the tapes are there you're welcome to get them and the quotes are there now as I said we were talking about in the message there of to where the Prophet called it let me see entitled the message even to that appearing before his coming right and he says that there's two different words there now the word appear is used in John but in uh 1 Peter 1:7 it talks about the appearing you know of the Lord and the prophet said there's a difference in the appearing he said in the scriptures you got two different words all right that's what we want to talk about tonight two different words appearing and coming all watch are two different works right one is appearing the other one is coming right two different works you say well now works is something we do we see there's your definition on it so let's go over just while we're getting that point and let's read it look at Romans uh 9 and let's get a little something that this script opened up to me years ago and and I really thank God for it let look at Romans 9 verse 27 excuse me verse 28 for he will finish the work once and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth now our definition of that would mean that God meant for it to go this far but he decided to cut it off is that what it kind of looks like you know that maybe God intended for it to go on down this way but he decided no I'll just cut it off here now you'll understand then why I'm using the word as two different words are two different works because the original translation of Romans 9:28 which uses the word work but that word work is 3056 in your Strong's Concordance which means word right the Lord is going to do a short word he's not going to do a short word he's not going to cut it short in righteousness he's not going to as I said have his thoughts of enduring this but instead of that well I'll just cut it off no he's going to do a short word right that's what your original says huh word works the word works there is 3056 words or word saying speech I like this a word uttered by a living voice right now that's how the strongs concordance so it's not a short work that he was going to do and going to quit it and all it's a short word right what's he going to do he's going to pour it in in hurry in the last days right it's not that he's going was intending to reveal whole lot of word and he's going to cut it out no he's going to reveal it in a hurry amen I mean it used to be that some of you were there and things and especially people here in the message tonight that you know back even in my day that we would uh we'd get a tape or two and get a book or two and and it' be a while before we get anything else you know and we just wasn't able to say well brother BR said this said this said this well see I had it in my Bible because there in in John where we was reading about the difference in the appearing and the coming I had a couple of messages written there and showing that brother brandham said that there was a difference in the two words right all right now we went through and there laying in the office if you want it we went through this past Wednesday with the the part of showing the difference between the word appearing right and the word coming literally in the scriptures right the word appearing is like I said in 1 Peter 1:7 it means to uncover or lay open what has been veiled or covered up disclose make bar to make known make manifest disclose what before was unknown that's what the appearing is right all right but then the word coming is the Greek word used 3950 uh two which is the word they argue in the message a lot about that's called paraca or perusia see that was the they say it's pronounced paria that's all right I don't know the difference I just know the definition CU I can read right see the King James version says in 1 John 228 at his coming the original translation says in the presence of him that is what the word coming means cuz it means coming it means presence it means the coming arrival Advent especially the future visible return from Heaven of Jesus to raise the dead hold the last judgment and set up formal and glorious the kingdom all right so I gave you the definitions to were that you would have it to be able to understand the prophet said it's two different words right one of them is something being seen the other one is in physical actual happen happening now that's where that then in the actual happening I'll get to it later on the message where the Prophet said that Jesus would be visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go in Rapture I've given you that quote over and over what the Holy Ghost was given for all right but that's not physical that's not mortal amen that's visible right visible means apparent to the eye Webster in other words it's not the physical eye necessarily it's the spiritual eye that sees you don't see with your natural eye you see with your your your inward being your ey is only a transmitter of backwards and forward all but see then to be visible Among Us doesn't mean he's going to be standing here in the physical body right amen no it means he's going to be here so visible until it's close to the fact but it will be outside of a glor a body like that cuz we're his body amen right why would he want to come back now we're his body amen right all right that's why we meet him in the air amen we only meet we only meet him in the air in the when it comes to the basis that he can be visible Among Us right right amen now in that then is the statement and reason why I preach the way I do cuz I believed this for 40 years I guess I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ to the bride you understand the bride amen is what the prophet said coming out of the church so I believe that on the day of Pentecost started the second coming of Jesus Christ amen we'll get to that point in a minute I believe that on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost descended that that started the second coming amen all right now then that would be finished in this day amen I don't want to go too far on the word of it because I want to keep your thought in a line but if you'll just get the definition of the words and look at those words I ask you to read those quotes that I gave you last Wednesday old over and over and over how many I ain't going to ask for to raise hand but that's the way brother Rams one it said it right all right see then he said there's a difference in the appearing and the coming right right a difference in the appearing and the coming he said in the scripture so I gave you the definition of the words appearing in coming now see I believe that's what I I just tell you what I believe I don't hide nothing with nobody I believe that the Lord can appear in many places that's right amen okay I believe he can appear out there in the denominations tonight right I believe he can appear in the Catholic church that's right I believe he can appear in the in the the mosque of Omar right I believe he can appear in many places all right because that is a spiritual sense he can be there if there's anybody ever healed anywhere when the Beatles were singing the songs right and and the the people were healed who healed them the be a come on right no it had to be the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ CU only God is the Healer right all right so presence are appear the appearing he can be anywhere he can appear in a barroom like Brother Richard Wilson tells you about his testimony that he was sitting in a bar and and drinking Y and he turned to start out and when he did said a voice said you won't be back in here again well brother R said on the tape one day he said he may have to come in the barroom and get you you see now now that was his appearing right amen okay cuz he can appear but now the coming of the Lord see the appearing is apparent to the eye or like Paul I gave you the definitions like the word Vision the word vision is the same word as appear appearing Etc all right but the word coming is his presence right right now his presence now you got to hold on cuz listen his presence is not in the barroom right he didn't give you the new birth sitting on the bar stool he called you out of the barroom I read one time about these women that were in a thing you know and they do a strip tease and then when it was over with they'd sat down and talk to the people about the Lord and try to get people converted what to right the bar room and the stripped off naked woman come on but that's the way people think right right see the women thought that was their Ministry to get people saved like Brother Gary Atkins used to say about the if that what is hippie Street down in town was what it supposed to be you know the love movement you the hippies then they already had it but no but now listen his appearing can be in many places but his coming is only through his presence being revealed to you amen that's why I believe the new birth is the revealing of God's word amen you tell me what else it is right shouting screaming Glory Hallelujah no that's after effects right that is not the new birth that's what you do after you get the new birth the birth is the birth of the word amen see the birth of the word brings the presence of God to you then the presence of God is a greater form our works of God than in his appearing when we go out of here in the Rapture you know what a lot of people will still be shouting Glory hallelujah amen right but the Lord's done gone Prophet said he's still thinking to getting the Holy Ghost right now let me ask you a question for where I won't miss it cuz I got in here somewhere what was the first coming of the Lord now he appeared many times throughout the Old Testament many forms many ways Pillar of Fire Cloud even as mount chesc amen Angel of the Lord to be in the fiery furnace with the Hebrew children he appeared in many ways but one day he came in human flesh amen that was his first coming am right right yes so what would you want to change the second coming Brother Gary to be right why do you want to try to make it some form that it's not what exactly what the first coming would be the first coming was God revealed in human flesh amen the second coming is what God revealed in your flesh by the new birth so he begin his second coming on the day of Pentecost amen we're in the ending of all things you know we're in the ending of all forms I don't don't think I've run out of something and run off because we're going to get into one of these days talking about the coming of the Lord as The Headstone you'll see why I kept reading Psalms all right so don't worry about that going on down the road I'm going to cover one of these days and got notes for it to cover that he will become visible Among Us where your Prophet said it and raised the dead and we go in Rapture amen so don't worry about it just just listen see see I believe that the Lord has been coming since the day of Pentecost in the heart of the bride of Christ right because that was what would be taking the bride out of the church now is your thoughts that when the prophet said the second coming of Jesus Christ is is the bright coming of Christ coming out of church that that's just in this time no right am he's been coming all the way down to that cuz it's not a physical coming but it's a presence of himself right In You by the new birth right now do you see the difference in the appearing but he can appear to you to lead you out of a bar run but when he gives you the new birth that's not his appearing that's right amen that's his coming to you amen well I I heard that not in the denomination they talking about to come and is coming to you well that's all right you're going to hear it a whole lot more if you hang around here amen because that's what I believe right go what are you looking for right oh no we're not looking for the Eastern Skies to split we're not looking for the trumpet to sound we're not well what do you believe well I just believe in his coming well praise the Lord I do too I'm just not looking for it up there right about 30 something years ago the Lord showed me something and you know I quit then trying to go to heaven that's right am because I realized if I ever got there that he's going to have to come here and get me and take me there right but he's not coming here physical right Corporal body and get me I'm going to meet that in the a right they going to come here in a presence that's right so don't worry about it that in you word is it really you know the brothers preached it and I'm not against that's their business they preached the peruas 1963 and that's when the Lord came and there's a lot of Truth to what they're talking about but I believe that the Lord came by the new birth amen because 1963 doesn't have anything to do with me and you unless we're born again right that's right that's right I mean if you're not born again they don't have anything do we you amen it's a condemnation right all right now God is living in You by the new birth are the word being revealed to you which is not just a a uh an anointing right because you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit right and die and go to hell right well wouldn't that be appearing come on I gave you a lot of the quotes where the brother ROM was covering he said appearing now in the church right course you know everybody said oh yeah he appeared and around him we believe that but I gave you the quotes where he was talking about about the appearing in the church amen in the bride all right now I gave you these this is one that was given to you last Wednesday where brother Brown says on we would see Jesus 1962 627 you don't have this one now you'll have one to follow in this one you see the West Coast the s o n is appearing before his coming he's appearing before he's coming remember appearing and coming is two different words see he's appearing now into church showing himself alive after 2,000 years sir we would see Jesus two different words right appearing and coming now pick up where you got them I just added that one cuz I've got the others laying here and if you want them after the service we'll be glad to give them to you of all of the quotes that we used last week but in the message perseverance preach in 1962 608 did you know that the Bible speaks of the appearing of the Lord and also the coming of the lord it's two different works now look at you no it's two different works why I titled it two different words two different works is two different works right search it and find out if that's right the appearing and the coming is two different things the appearing of the Lord is now he's appearing amongst his people we see him in his same works the appearing his holy spirit but his coming will be in a physical being it will be to catch the church up you go right on down reading the rest of goes on down in that's paragraph uh I e95 e96 so the Lord is now appearing among his people great signs and wonders raising the dead Healing The Sick and doing the very same things he did that hasn't been done for 2,000 years now like I said Wednesday brother brandham prayed for a man for his nose to be restored a few days later it was restored brother Bosworth if I Ain mistaken prayed and it was instantly healed or restored see we think brother randam was the only one that had it why don't you think he called it Divine Healing campaign right or Roberts and all of those men went forth that God was using them amen it was a healing campaign T osbor all those men used to do great wonders and signs am well we don't know about that we just know about brother brand well you're not even in his coming anyway so you don't have the new birth right you had a new birth you'd have enough sense to realize what it said the true right that he was back there he's still here now right if you can't see him now in the new birth and his presence with you healing and delivering right amen then you're blind right amen it's a best way to say it at least you can't say I don't play around you I tell you like it is because brother R said when you say it hard and strong people won't know won't think you're trying to pull something over on you say it real soft you know they don't know what you're doing but now listen brother brandom says on Christ The Mystery of God revealed that he had to wait God had to wait page 32 number two on your nose he had to wait until the secret could be given in full right look at what under line waiting to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it waiting for it to be fully comprehended what's he talking about the next paragraph tells you now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming right well brother Dale the prophet said he didn't even know how he's coming and you told us his coming was the New Birth well if you're not sensible enough to know what the prophet is doing you need a new birth come on because surely at this time he knew what the second coming of Jesus Christ was right amen this is 63 you know by then he knew cuz he preached a three-fold revelation of it that's right right Amen on the seventh seal he only preached one fold of it spoke a little bit of the second stopped and left it for quite a while then on Christ of mystery he preached the three-fold Revelation amen of what the coming of Jesus Christ right right and that way he said it had to be weit until it could be comprehended what what was he waiting for it to be able to comprehend is coming you say but now now Jesus didn't even know no but I can quote too because I remember everybody calls me intellectual and that's all right if that's because I can quote brother ROM you got a problem brother rown said when Jesus come to John on patmas he knew when he would be coming and he said he put it there when he come to John on pmas he knew when he would be coming cuz he had went back to where he was originally and come back that's right all right now see if we must meet him in the air and he does not come to Earth in a physical body then we better be thinking about the coming of the Lord has been revealed right what do you think of his message was Far amen I haven't even got to the scripture where it said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel trumpet I even got to there yet we just building the background to talk about some things right see it is only revealed the second coming of Jesus Christ can only be revealed to those who have the new birth amen that don't mean a light bub turned on does it right that ought to be sensible the Bible said that no man can call Jesus the Christ what except what am your Prophet said except by the new birth right cuz you're only saying what somebody else says and that's her problem Mama told us come on brother mama said the heavens are open one of these days like I told you somebody told me when I was a little kid that I know when the Lord was coming because it'd be a cloud and there'd be an umbrella in the cloud oh man I'd go out every time he come up a cloud I'm looking for an umbrella what was your stupidity I admit mine what is yours now come on I will admit what I am but listen the prophet said there's a difference in the appearing and the coming right now I used to think as I told there was only just a few of those until I I got to run it through the computer again and I got to find in a whole lot and I gave them to you last week and uh you know a lot of the things and if you would have time and you want to read them I'll be glad for you to take these where that he says that the appearing of the Lord comes before the coming of the Lord that's the message letting off the pressure 62 it is I Be not Afraid you know there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ that's two different words all together the appearing now to church we see him right Be not Afraid 62 there's a different word used the appearing and of Christ and the coming of Christ there two different words all together Christ is appearing in these last days in his church bringing his church together in unity we would see Jesus 62 after 2,000 years we see the infallible proof that we can see Jesus us he's appearing in our midst just before his coming he's making his appearance in his church in the last days you'll be welcome to these I don't mean that sarcastically I'm just say it if you don't know brother R said it run in the message appearing and then coming now there is some catches to it that sometimes it will not appear it's appearing and coming so if you want these welcome to cut you down on your short on trying to do it but go back last Wednesday and you hear the prophet saying the things that I'm talking about cuz you see I believe he's been appearing right but the mystery of it was at the same time he was appearing his coming was transpiring right amen cuz he was coming in the bride right who led Luther out of the Catholic Church that was this coming we see to be climaxed in you and I because the prophet of God said the coming of the Lord is Mystery is in a mystery his coming is in a mystery amen we know in the Scripture it talks about the mystery of the Gentiles everybody thinks of what brother Ram is talking about when he'll use that scripture he's not talking about the coming of the Gentiles Bing knew about that and told us about he's talking about an end time coming the word of the Lord can descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel will have to be in the bride cuz she's the final voice under her message let me quote it under her messenger she'll be the final voice to the final age amen so the voice of the Resurrection will have to be in the bride amen God's waiting on you and IA right but in time where he can pour in his fullness right amen come on you see I want to make sure you understand see the seventh seal souls in prison you look at number five on your notes watch that seven that's the Finish seventh is always a mystery that was the coming of the Lord and noticed he said that was the coming of the Lord right amen right like I said to you I haven't got to this yet so hang on to it all the quotes that you find of the appearing and the coming was from 62 back I've never found one after 62 where he was talking about the peering and the coming of two different words if you do let me know it's all right it won't change what I'm saying right could you see he was looking at the peering of Jesus Jesus Christ but when he met God out there and come back to preach those seals he never spoke anymore about his appearing right he never spoke of anything that's why he called let's see where it say don't Christ the mystery the seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was even forbid to write the coming of the Lord what is the coming of the Lord Brother Brandon Feast of the trumpets number six on your notes 64 719 the seventh seal has an open yet you know that's his coming see the seventh is a mystery that's is coming and you can't explain that to anyone else right because it can only be revealed to you personally amen I can't reveal it to you brother randam couldn't reveal it to you right that's right now brother randam said Jesus said my own life didn't reveal that that's right that's right so now no man can reveal to another man anything right right you can only use words to speak of something long enough for the Holy Spirit to be able to Quicken it in your heart now if you don't have the Holy Spirit that's why you see so many doctrines that's right and ideas see Amen in the denominations and in this message y because everybody has their own concept y That's right people actually literally preached years ago the perusia or paria people now I ain't saying everybody cuz but the ones I heard was preaching what that in 1963 the Lord came well then others went on to make brother r on that Lord and how that the Lord died on amarilla road and in Texas 65 but you see I believe what the prophet is talking about amen but I believe there's a difference in the appearing amen and the coming right amen and then you'll see one day why that it was up until 62 he kept speaking and I ain't one of them come on I don't play games I'm not one of them that until 62 he taught one thing and after 62 he taught something else I do not believe that I believe he talked the same all the way through he so he changed the new birth show me where it did Future home he said that he taught three processes from the beginning and show me where he changed that's right oh of course that doesn't do any good but it just flows through people's mind right on out the other side and they pass it back behind them to the next one cuz they got it all figured out right you see brother Ram didn't have it figured out right God is the only one that knows am that's right but if he can reveal that mystery read Christ The Mystery of God revealed when he gets over about page 17 and talking about the coming of the Lord the seventh seal Yen and showing you exactly what it is in a three-fold revelation amen all God was he pour into Christ all Christ in the church and what then to take her back to the Garden of Eden right restore Fallen Eve amen all right so now you say well brother D what are you talking about he's appearing among us but if we can just see what that new birth means right you say brother Dale you preached so deep I don't understand you show me how more simple you can make it please come up here and do it and I'm not saying it wrong right women whatever come on tell us how simple it is right when I preach that the coming of the Lord is a revealing of his word that gives you a new birth right making you God manifested in human flesh for the portion you are right amen when all of that is finished brother said when that Holy Ghost is fully given out it'll be all with right because the coming of the Lord is what the revealing of his Worden and you tell me how more simple that can be you know the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ right that's what he says in Christ The Mystery of God revealed amen that's why he calls it Christ the mystery didn't say Jesus the mystery M cuz Jesus never fulfilled the full mystery it was all in him yeah cuz we were in him Amen in the New Birth not in physical people but it's Christ the mystery brother R said I couldn't understand how that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something he said until I seen it was Christ he didn't say I seen it was Jesus he said I seen it was Christ amen the Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's right now listen we must during the time that he's appearing in this last days with great signs and wonders now are you are you going to be dumb enough excuse me are you going to be far enough off to say that that that God is not outd there in the denominations Healing The Sick are you that far mentally off that he's not out there Healing The Sick and doing great wonders come on he's out there more than most of us because that's all they dealing with but see that's his anointing right right exactly right that's his anointing that's out there amen but that's not his coming right right amen he's only coming in his bride am amen not Rebecca knew what Isaac looked like right right amen right now come on I guess we we we get into a lot of things but I mean you pick out a husband a wife for your husband and and then you w't at least tell them what it look like you know I mean even in these marriage things that brother prash and India and them they do at least they know most all way their life that that who they're going to marry maybe because they and they've seen them and and everything else it's not just a guy over here decides to get this and his over side well let's put them together and make a marriage no they know a lot about each other Rebecca had heard so much about Isaac right right until she said is that him standing in the field I your Prophet used that to show what that Jesus we would meet him in the air right right amen but we're going to have to know all about him right because if not we're going to be caught by these Antichrist oh my that will be telling us they are Jesus and they are this and they're that right but see Rebecca she knew but there's another thing that Rebecca done you remember the story of the little woman that armor meat packing company man down to find a wife and he told her I'll be back in one year yeah well in that story The Prophet never said that he provided her a garment she got herself ready right she got her own dress she done her own thing amen but in God see God supplies everything but you know Rebecca she wasn't running out through there across the yard you know looking like Joy saw me going through Walmart one day with an old slashy hat pulled over one way and a and an old flattery looking shirt that was one color and a pair of pants it was another and paint all over them and wearing tennis shoes it was wor slap out and my toes were sticking out and uh I was going to speak to her when she came around cuz I saw her but she didn't know who I was she could only see from the head down and she walked around she didn't say hey Pastor she didn't say that you know what she said she said you know what I just talk who in the world girl would look like that it would me her pastor but you see now Rebecca was ready right amen Rebecca was ready right the little girl was ready relationship Hallelujah we got to be ready you got to put on the wedding garment he supplies it don't worry about trying to get it and don't worry about it whether it fits or not don't worry about whether it's got to be reemed or SE or else don't worry about it it'll fit perfectly because it's the word cuz we're not all the there none of us is all of the word that's why I believe the coming of the Lord is around the world right I don't believe it's just in Lula Georgia righten I believe it's around the world as the revealing of God's word right amen and seeing the bride of Christ got to couple of from Brother Rocky most of you remember from from uh Philippines and uh brother uh narcis got an email telling me that they were praying for my wife Hallelujah I mean one called me the other day he said brother there when you coming I said look man I can't come now I'm sending to you years old I'm wore out we got to let somebody else do these things bless he said well we just want to know when you're coming see people want to hear the word that's right right amen they're tired of hearing Doctrine they got emails but this man said he was tied up in this certain Doctrine y was that actually about the coming of the Lord and how did he come there in 63 and that's it you know you just you did you see church we were 963 right but see God was there that was the coming of the Lord to the prophet amen right right which was the revealing of the word right now it's got to be the coming of the Lord to you and I and the word is our wedding garment that we must put on F vir H his temper patience G in this brotherly kindness right the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then finally The Headstone amen M that headstone is not going to sit down on the foot come on that's right God ain't going to adopt a child just because he's 2 years old and because he belongs to his mom and daddy right and I like the way that I believe it too that God ain't going to adopt the devil's children that's right he's going to make you a child of his before he starts your adoption you can holler all you want to I come into the world with this I come into the world with that would just holler all you want to cuz you're going to be in the tribulation one of these days and just keep on hollering that's right said Brother D you shouldn't why not Isaac had left the father's house when he met Rebecca in the field right we got to be prepared to meet him right that can only be done by the revealing of God's word amen what can take away the things are are are clothe us I just don't I don't want to be clothed with a uh you see me on Wednesday we always say they going around here on Wednesday where's a TI of preacher you know and you see me at Wednesday I walk in the door and they say well we no you're not going to preach tonight well see I I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not just that old preacher image that my brother-in-law he used to cut his grace and work on his car and everything else with a suit on I'm not joking you never SE him didn't I was suit them I see I'm I'm sorry I'm not that I guess the only thing I got for me I can preach a little you know but listen folks he must appear That's right now tie this together I'll quit in that appearing is where he becomes visible right that's right now that sounds a little odd don't do away with the appearing and start oh we're in the coming we're in the coming oh now we're in the coming we're not in appearing no more we're in the coming we toot you horn all you want to you going to be in the tribulation tooting it he's appearing now right he's going to become visible Among Us right he's going to raise the dead and we're going to go into Rapture right it's not you and me right is him amen it is he that hath made us and not we are his not we ourselves right he's made us for a purpose to know and realize the coming of the Lord is that new birth that's within your heart but that's not the finish of the coming of the Lord come on Amen right that's just the beginning of the coming that's right but that is the beginning of it right as Jesus was there on Earth he appeared in the Old Testament as the Christ right right but then one day he walked out there in human flesh right amen by the new birth is God in you I've heard people say that I wish I could come to the place where that that it would be like Jesus where he says he's pleased to dwell what you don't have the new birth then because if you got the new birth exactly where he said he he pleased to dwell in you right amen are you going to wait till you get up to the top of the pyramid then he gets pleased no amen he either dwells in you by the new birth or he's not d right we don't grab ourselves like brother Mo said by shoe heels our straps you know strings and jump up in The Headstone right now you're going to have to be birthed into it you're going to be born into these things and being born into him can only be one thing what the revealing of his word right amen I'm not looking for his coming I'm saying he's here right now I'm going to make one more statement and I'll quit Brother Gary tell them what page it's on bless he knows what I'm saying I preached the seals back there in 79 then preached it again in ' 82 cuz it wasn't satisfied I didn't finish in 79 and I couldn't see the end of all things but in ' 82 I begin to preach the seals I've never preached on them again why cuz I don't need to right but you know in that I made a statement I said why is people so concerned about the coming of the Lord you realized that when he raised from the dead he appeared right now are you listening he appeared to those and they went out a message that he is risen right right right well why wouldn't the seventh seal being in the end of all things be one simple thing he is here right he is here well where's he at get born again you'll know exactly where he's at he's inside of you by the new birth that's his coming I that's not all of it I've never taught nothing like that I said we'll get to the point of the coming of The Headstone cuz we could preach the statue of a perfect man of the coming of virtue to Faith and then knowledge coming Temperance coming patience coming godliness coming all of those things is is coming just get one thing appearing it's like Visions it's like apparent to the eye which means that it's not necessarily to the physical eye it doesn't even mean that in Webster it can be the spiritual eye of understanding I've had a couple of Visions I used to say I had one now I've had two and those Visions I had nothing to do with it I was standing here reading the scripture one night and looking down reading the scripture literally and some other form took over and I kept reading and right across there I saw the coming of the Lord I'm just tell you what I saw all right and that's what I try to preach cuz I saw like the United States and like the old uh Pony Express When They Carried the mail you know and how they You' seen movies where they put the Pony Express guy you know and he runs to Utah over into Arizona and then he you know the hores that's what I saw but you you know what I saw I saw each state with a little light in it that was the coming of the Lord right but listen Church those Visions can be tampered with by Satan right that's right he can impersonate all of them but there's one thing he can't impersonate he cannot impersonate the second coming of Jesus Christ he knows nothing about it right you say he just heard it cuz you said it that don't make any difference right if it can't be revealed to him he doesn't know what I'm talking about right I think people to tell me you need to be careful what you say cuz the devil hears it hey I want him to hear it I wish he could get born again bless him and if he got born again he'd be able to understand what I'm talking about right but he can't do it why cuz he turned it down right don't turn down the Simplicity of the new birth right do you understand Jesus appeared in the Old Testament but then he was come that was his first coming what would be the difference then in his second coming he would appear down through time on one side of the gauge is appearing the other way he's coming right but see that's a mystery that's been hidden from the foundation of the world but is now made known by the end time Prophet it is appearing and coming is two different words brother Dale you're not yes I'm looking for one of these days there something to happen and we go up in the sky right and we'll meet him in the air right that's right don't believe in getting a new body believe in this body being redeemed right you're all laughing at the hospital about it you know we were laughing a little bit today about it you know some of you who got nuts and bolts and screws Danny was here he tell you about all of The Metalist was in his body you know what in one way or another he's getting a new body he's got a new elbow he I mean a shoulder my wife's got a new knee you know but that ain't it because you could make all of it over you remember the $6 Million Man where they found a brain and a heart and this that and the other and they made him a body oh Danny he's almost on a million now you getting all these new parts but that ain't doing no good that's right cuz it's the same body my wife goes into the change she won't carry the metal with her and have to worry about the metal detector going off when she gets to Glory bless amen it'll be this body redeemed right the prophet said ever higher you ever lost right God knows about it amen that's right I know this is kind of a comical way of expressing it but I remember brother Hans is preaching one time you go take you take bass at your house over about 10 years there's actually bigger you in the septic tank than there are are standing there looking at me right said what well you wash all skin every time don't you but you see that's not what God's going to do reach down the septic tank and grab your body he's going to speak you come from the original amen because you remember how I preached it Jesus's body brother BR said come from the 16 elements of the earth and you tell me it come out of this dirty earth and I'm going to tell you I don't believe it right I don't believe running around talking about it coming out of the dirty earth right right I believe he was talking about from the original that brought Adam amen which was a word right you see why I love the word amen come on brother I love that word so what is it two different words now keep it in mind read those things over and over what appearing and then coming he's appearing but his coming is a secret amen that's right the only way you can know that secret is be a part of it right course the way we do it is about like the little boy little boy one time he was going to tell somebody something and he said I want to tell you something said it's the secret said me and Grandpa he said only one that knows it he stood there a minute and he he started crying he said you know I forgot what it is and said now Grandpa's only that knows it you see the secret coming of the Lord to take you and I away the revealing of his word right I'd like to hear your definition about it I'll be glad to sit down and talk with anybody about it around the world internet or whatever as you explaining all about the coming I don't send me a thing that he come in 63 I believe he did but that was to brother brandom only amen but I believe the reason he never spoke of the appearing and coming after the opening of the seals was because he knew what the coming was he knew the coming of the Lord was right there that's why he could say and don't misinterpret it cuz people have brother R said here stands a lamb tonight with a book in his hand and out there goes the white horse rider he said see there the white horse rider is the Antichrist but he even can say well he would say here stands God right here and you you know that's okay like I told a man up at Jeffersonville one time he was telling me he was talking to these people about brother ROM being deity and they're standing in front of the old um Armory where the PO word used to be and I looked at him I said brother if you'll tell me that that brother right there by the new birth is deity now he's not got the gifts brother around him had he's not got the things that he could do we're not talking about that we're talking about just the deity part I said if you'll tell me that brother with a new birth is deity I'll agree with you that brother ROM was deity by the new birth he said oh no brother said okay I just l left CU ain't no need talking to them you're not going to convince anybody right I've never tried to convince anybody my own family my wife or anybody I don't try to convince my family of what I what I try to preach CU if they can't see it not going to do them any good you must have your own Revelation you must see yourself it's not a husband and wife situation it's you and God together together it's not cuz Mom and Daddy's in that I'm going no it's you and I together but if you're in why can't you believe for your children amen why can't you I stand what we got 392 in the red book 392 in the red book anybody have a need Jesus the light of the world you have a need come I believe that same God that walk the shores of Galilee is here tonight the of the world I believe it we walk in the with Bey come where the of Mercy are right shine all aroundus let's just believe father in the name of our Lord and

believeth that the Lord has come in this that's what he had to say he believed in God being real right he didn't believe in mythologies and thoughts he believed God was real you know that's what caught me because that was how serious he was cuz I I had met God before and say I knew there was a God but I didn't have anybody could get me there to him what I seen him just so real to he could have created worlds now nobody that could tell me about it I'd ask people and they say you need to go i' BST and say you need to go to a Pentecostal I didn't know that really what I need to do when that Prophet began to talk about God he is years I come that same one but it took me 2 years to get rid of myself to be able to get born again just because you say I believe brother randam and thing
