========================================
over and over and over oh oh amen i'm glad he loves me too won't you yeah that's all stamped this time we'll change over to service open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open the eyes my and i am foreign amen amen i want to see you amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord but i'd like to have our visitors back there with us and be with us today we always say when you come one time you're a visitor you come two times you're part of us we don't have anything to join up with but we're glad to have you with us and also brother kern i believe that's the way you pronounce it we'll be leaving tuesday he's been here with us for a little while from haiti is that right trinidad excuse me i've always missed the wrong place i put you in the wrong country i can't get this straight trinidad all right but he's going back tuesday so we've had a good time enjoyed him being with us amen and i don't know any other announcements to be made i guess that's all the visitors we've got because you come one time you're a visitor you come two times you don't get counted to visit this part of us you don't know but we're glad to have it let's have everybody with us good to see everybody amen if you'd like turn in your scripture turn to revelations one where we've been reading and we will read revelations one one through three and just continue on to where i thought hold two uh there's a brother brother ernie sinister i'm thankful and really coming from brother berry coffee about a brother and one javed i guess the way you pronounce it that he's in pakistan and they've been giving him a lot of trouble some kind of a group guy has been giving him a lot of trouble um beating him up threatening him and everything so just remember that remember all of these missionaries it seemed to be that the foreign fields is getting the blunt now of starting the thing so we know that it'll you know it'll work its way all the way through so let's just pray for these and we'll leave this back there and you you remember pray for these all right heavenly father we thank you for your loving your grace unto us we thank you for salvation for peace for joy thank you for all thanks and we ask you now that you would just come among us to lord reveal yourself unto us not to just watch all of us in our actions but to be able to lord reveal yourself into our hearts and lives forgive our sins most of all and cover us by the blood and just bless each one bless our visitors lord if they're with us today and may they understand all of our ways and thoughts and ideas and and just pray for us lord remember this brother there in pakistan that lord is being threatened his family and things and we ask you to just bless those be with all the little bride around the world that's not hard to pray because it's a promise that you would do it so we pray that you would just go forth and just remember them lord have your way now and guide us in jesus name amen revelations 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john that by a record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the lord and his blessing to the reading of the word remember we covered the time is at hand there never was a time for this book of revelations to be understood until this end time that's right all right so now it's here and you know time for us to understand and to walk there in and to see you know the light of the level god made manifest to his little bride by revealing himself now we covered this past wednesday night as we read so we'll turn over and read revelations 4 1 and we started covering the open door and what john saw this is a kind of a study on the book of revelations not doing it in depth like we did back years ago but trying to skip over some things and just pick up some points and getting down into revelations chapter 5. all right so you know we'll go to revelation 4 1 and just look at the scripture there and see what it says all right so it says after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show the things which must be here after and we'll go ahead and read verse 2 because that'll get into our message part and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one set on the throne you know we appreciate the brothers running those things up now the open door you remember how we covered it you remember jesus said in john 10 said i am the door of the sheep he didn't say just that i'm the door of the cheap fold or something that's fine because all that tops out and all but he said i am the door of the sheep because that's who we are you know we are his we are his sheep and and we we thank god that he's made us to be that but we covered the open door and speaking on it and we'll go back and pick up a little bit in a minute to see that but remember the scene was on earth in chapter one of revelations and he saw you know the things of revelations one i saw one standing in the midst of the gulf seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man uh gerd about the paps we covered that as showing the feminist part of the you know being the bride of christ and it's like i've told you the book of revelations to me is the greatest book of all the books after we've become to a point of understanding because in the book of revelations you never find jesus just by himself standing somewhere or something he's always in the bride or revealing himself to the bride is standing there with her or basically in her it's it's it's the greatest book and i've always said if i had to just take one one uh book i could take you know out of the bible i would take the book of revelation now because we understand it we were first told we couldn't understand it now we see it so simple a child can understand because you know you're not looking for some kind of a a physical door to be cut in heaven you know and john looks up and oh there's a door you know you know it's probably lost you know no we're not trying to do that we we're trying to look and see what these things mean and by way of the prophet's message expounding unto us the the symbolics of the book of revelations then we'll have any trouble with understanding it we just read it and believe it and see what it's talking about but see we look at as i said jesus would say i am the door of the sheep he was expressing himself back there for what he was and then that's what we were trying to cover wednesday that we'll read in just a minute again where john saw jesus and that's what he saw he didn't look up and see those are symbolics a door was just a symbol right see that was just a symbol that wasn't a door up there it was a person that he saw all right now we'll get to that in a minute but what i want you to see is is go ahead brother and pull up these scriptures i want you to see that there there has been it has been spoken of before about heaven being opened and people being able to see and the things that we're seeing there and you'll think well well you know did he look at the door and see the door and jesus standing in the door now he saw the door and he knew that was jesus all right so now we go back in the old testament we pick up genesis where the jacob watched what he saw and he lied upon a certified they centered verse chapter genesis 28 11-13 because the sun was set and he took the stones of that place and put them for pillars and lay down in that place to sleep and what and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and watch it's on the earth i love it that way because we're down here all right and the top of it reached to heaven all right now watch and behold the angels of god ascending and descending now look at that away ascending and descending see we think the angels were descending and ascending now see watch what it says these are the angels of god ascending from where jacob was there wasn't up there coming down they were down here with jacob and you know because i don't angels in hell is wonderful that's all right i want him down here you know i need help down here i get to have my life to worry about that but what and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac now watch in the land where he forgives book and our point is what he looks up the dream and what does he see he sees the lord standing at the top of the ladder right john saw jesus amen jacob saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven and angels going from jacob which was taking his prayers and that's what it does for me and you see the angels of god take your prayers and carry them up all right then bring back the rewards to you like the revelation of the word the things the healings or whatever and see i like it that way it's not it's not descending and that's anything it's totally different right all right we'll go now to the book of acts and let's see it again all right so in acts now this is stephen what and when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they niced on him with their teeth but he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of god see he's giving you two situations in the bible that we could spend a dra amount you know large amount of time speaking on that what these see it was a symbolics back there and still symbolics now but i hope you notice in genesis that it did use the capital lord god himself standing at the head of the latter you know welcoming you and i all right now then but let's get down to the point and just review we're still on the review for just a little bit a couple of quotes i want you to keep these so go ahead to quote number three i want you to read these and think about it this is revelation chapter four part one of it 1960 12 31 this door said in heaven that door now once that door when he looked up he saw the lord jesus but john didn't look up and see a door he did now get it right now listen to me let's see follow me he saw a door but immediately the understanding to john was that's right john was there to get these symbolics and break them down to you and i so sure he saw a door just like jacob saw a ladder in his dream and he saw god standing at the top of the ladder all right now the latter is the lord jesus because the only way to get to heaven is to jesus christ see that's why we could spend some drastic amount of time on each one of those things and stephen he saw the heavens opened but he saw jesus standing at the right hand of the father where and the throne we'll get to this afternoon all right and when we get to that point then we'll see what it is well look what he saw now notice what he said now the scene is changing john's been watching patmos what was on earth and going on you know and telling him the times the church ages and the you know the revelations one and then revelation two and three church ages now the scene is changing john's been watching fatma's and now he looks up fine he sees something went on on earth here the church ages all down to the seven church ages and then after he got through seeing the church ages after that after the church ages had ceased he heard a voice and he looked up towards heaven and he seen an open door and the first voice sounded like a trumpet all right scene changed from patmos to heaven i remember we covered the voice and the person is the same right so when john heard the voice as he did in revelations 1 he turns to see the voice but he sees seven golden candlesticks he sees it symbolic but what did he see jesus christ he turned to see the one that had spoke to him on earth and that's what's happening here in revelations 4 that's right things are going to be made known and revealed but first you've got to see jesus all right you say i see the bride well it's good but you remember you can only see the bride by seeing jesus christ see then it'll come forth that you'll see really what it's all about then you'll see jesus because he is that is who she is all right now watch the next one then all right this is revelation chapter four part one the same message now he after the church edge was over and everything was come ready made ready the setting of the fourth chapter here the church ages was done he had done left the earth you see remember the voice that fight spoke to him behind him in the seven golden candlesticks now that's chapter one right right that's where he saw it and he heard the voice and he turns the sea of his head and he turns to see this he's selling the old candlestick but he knows the voice the voice is the one that he talked to on earth that he sat down and ate with and fellowship with the lord jesus christ all right and now that same voice was speaking up in heaven what was it he had done redeemed his people his earthly work was finished and he was in glory calling to john come up hither uh um amen that makes me feel like shouting all through the new year now remember what we covered in the voice they brought around and said to charlie cox you know he said brother charlie the one that told called you and told you to turn around will one day call you until you come up just not a different voice the one that spoke to you about your salvation right the one that calls you is the same what it's going to call us up not two or three different holy ghosts and you know and all kind of things to get into man's mind and you know trinities and points like that but now here's what i want you to get today i know it's going to take a little bit of understanding in your mind to comprehend the things because you're so used to being this way this way this way so you might want to change from this way to that way and that was him you know he said i'm the way the truth of the life right now but see by our teachings and our thoughts in our minds and are trying to comprehend everything by the natural we get into trouble all right see that's why we've always been taught to stay away from the book of revelation because we tried to understand those things naturally now some of the people like schofield and the different ones they went into some things and began to see things and thank god for it there was people down through time that had truth but we're in the end time where the truth is the prophet's message has been brought to us and if we need to have an understanding we just go ask him what it's all about right yeah he said well he ain't here to ask him see there's one of those natural points in your mind he ain't here now to ask you we got the books and the tapes the computers to run it off right the way these notes right here years ago when i preached this probably the first time back about 40 years ago it took me weeks and weeks to find these you know to search out through the message listen to tapes and write down the quotes now we can just go over the computer and instantly we've got the quotes and a whole lot more than what we used to have and that's why i've always said you know everybody wants my bible because i wrote i used to write my own concordance if you don't know something on the godhead i can just turn it here and tell you you will know what the third pull i'm just turning here and tell you because that's where i write them down all right now but the point is now we're showing where we can just get it in a hurry and understand right now but my point this this morning is one thing the bride will go up in revelations 4 1. all right that's right yes now listen real carefully because we're going to give the prophets quotes to these like in the seal book like in feast of the trumpets and others and the bride the prophet said is not seen from revelation 4 1 to 1921. now you got to remember what he's saying she's not seen on earth because she's definitely seen in revelations 4 right because she goes up that's right john is the type she's definitely seen in revelations 5 yep because we're priests and kings and et cetera you know all right so then don't just see when you hear a prophet say something you got to be able to listen carefully what he's saying amen because you take that cell the church is saying no more come well then you go in the book of revelation and read it you you know right so that's not the way that we're trying to approach it we try to approach it by revelation to understand what's being said and sometimes it takes that like i told you that brother motor i remember him telling me see when they were just hearing the tights and going to the tabernacle and like brother brown said adam and eve went out of the garden you see to them that just meant it was out it was gone you know and said it may be months or whatever before the prophet would preach another sermon that they could get a hold of and would run around would say but see they had a lamb before they went out right well see then you can get into a lot of trouble by not having the the ability to search out and see what the prophet is saying so just like i said there the prophet will say the bride is not saved no more well she's not seen on earth that's right but she can be seen in heaven but not like we're thinking now here's the problem and i've tried to express this for many many over 40 years you say the bride goes up in revelation 4 1 and not seen until 1921 when she writes back but brother table revelation 10 7 are you saying that that's not brother branham no i'm not saying that right i'm not saying that i'm saying it's placed in order amen yes yes but brother dale where it says in revelation 18 4 come out of here my people if you're not saying that's the bride coming out no i'm not saying that right but now are you going to listen to what the prophet had to say are you going to take your own interpretation that's right so if he says the bride goes up in 4-1 and not single 1921 then don't try to see her on earth amen right right well she's already in heaven and earthling right right that truth so what goes on on earth is no concern to the bride the seals right i tried to preach that in in 1979 started from there on up especially 82 and 83 that were that that we talk about the seals oh yes we understand the seals the white horse riders antichrist well clarence larkin said that before brother brown did did that make it right no because he didn't have the revelation he had a partial understanding because he was still riding on the same white horse but you see the seals have nothing to do with the bride right there to israel that's correct amen the revelation of the seals is what has to do to you and i thank god all right because the seals show it we'll read the quote from the end where the seals show what it was what is and what will be all right so the complete plan of redemption is shown in the seven seals but the actual opening of the seals is to israel they asked brother brown on the questions and answers says does uh the man of sin sitting in the temple of god showing himself to be as god he says that the first seal he says yes right amen well we better not be around here when the man of sin is revealed that's sitting in the temple of god we know who he is why we've been told the story we know the end of the book right we know who john and mary is but we know the happily ever after living right that's right it's like i said there the other day god said to abraham said can i withhold anything that's right amen seeing that he's the heir of all times and you just get old up and give him a layout he said well what you give to him you get him all the way down to chains of the body right the man come on he made him a young man see so he showed him the whole plan of redemption all right we see that way that we have to follow it you say yeah but i've always been taught the seals to the bride the revelation is to the bride yeah go now listen i gotta cover a few things this morning to get them out of the way the white horse rider is the antichrist right right that's not the seal that's right sorry that's what you see when the seal is broken amen the seal is the holy spirit come on get in the bible ephesians 4 30 great not the holy spirit whereby you're single see we say we understand the seals the seals is a revelation of jesus christ then when you see jesus christ reveal you automatically see these other things go to the first seal and read it notice where brother around and said my revelation is that god and jesus and the holy ghost is the seventh same person amen right he said thy ghost nobody was right thereby that guy that fellow going that way is the antichrist now that's trinitarians it didn't matter how many people we had running all over the place right you see where we can't comprehend it with a trinity that's right right we're gonna have a guy running this way to god running that way to god run look at that there's god revealed great big bunch of grace well we thought we had it then i'd like for you to get it out of your mind the seals is the revelation of jesus christ that's right and when you see jesus christ revealed you will automatically see the opposition check how many times brother brown calls him that other fellow that other guy that's writing off if you see two people in the bible you better believe one of them's got to be the antichrist because there's only one person in the bible revealed i like the way brother brown says things he said jesus is not the second person third person second person he said he's not even the first person that's right and that's a direct quote if you want him i'll be glad to get it he said he is the person see if you say a first person that means they can be two or three more but when you say that just one person that's why he could see that one person revealed to him was the revelation of jesus christ when that seal unfolded he saw that jesus that he preached all those years and he saw another fellow riding on so then that way it gives you a better understanding of reading the seal book because you're reading to see a book not to find out what's going to happen to you but to find out who you are right that's right we read the bible to try to find it well if i could just find the things i need to get rid of and the things i need to do but don't worry about it they're in there you'll find it you ought to know it that's right i know my problems don't you i live with me but you see we read the bible trying to find out where to make us good or right you know earth made us bad that we can repent of that's that's all right good but why not read it to see who you are the book's written to you i always tell you this is my bible i mean is this don't belong to my wife somebody give it to me i forgot to give you this one brother gave me one i'll wear them out you know but this is my bible this book is talking to me you've got to have your own bible now that don't mean she can't read my bible josh has got my old one with all of the notes in it if you ever want to know anything ask josh he sits down and used to sit down here with us and questions and answers and they always told him he couldn't answer them because he had a cheat sheet you know when he was asking what was and josh had it written down he wasn't allowed to answer all right that's fine but still that's my book the bible is speaking personally to me you understand that's right you've got to believe it's speaking to you all right now see that way that it's my book we'll get to it when we get into revelations 5. all right but now getting on to the point of another thing he said well what about revelation 10 7. and like 18 4 those two you know the quoted because i had the brothers sliding those under the table under my nose one time when i was trying to say this when i told him i said brothers brother brown said in the feast of the trumpets he said in the seal book i gave him quote after quote but i said in a feast to the trumpet he said this is thus left the lord all the way through i said in that message he emphatically states the bride goes up 4-1 we'll read it doesn't come back from 1921. but see their minds couldn't comprehend what was being said but you know it's a very simple thing to me because after the lord spoke to me and you know what i'm glad that day see there must need to be heresies that they that approve may be made manifest and you know until that day i had a doubt in my own mind about what i was saying i could quote brother brown but i didn't have anything anchored into my heart that i could discuss it with you from my own revelation i had the quotes from the prophet and i believed it all right now then i didn't try to figure it out so we were coming back up the road and this brother he said brother daley said i've never seen your expression like that i said what do you mean he said you look so down and out when you left that meeting i said brother you don't understand i said i gave them what brother brown said and they were just sitting there turning it apart by their own intellectual concept because they couldn't comprehend and it just dropped down the very key let's go to revelation 10 and we're going to go to this this way but we will i've preached this to you before so most of you know look in revelations 10 and let's read what it says maybe they'll catch up by the time i'll start reading brother if you want to go to revelation 10 and i'll start reading in chapter verse 1 of revelation 10. and look what he says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven flowed with a cloud okay it doesn't got me they're sharper than i am they're younger than i am too yeah look what he says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven over the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire all right brother brown said on page 72 and 74 the seal book the revelation 10 1 is the same as revelations 1 10 through 13. okay so we're starting off with what what's seen on the bride right now i didn't give these answers your prophet gave it we'll be glad to get a seal and let you run it up a little bit he said it's the same as revelations one one standing in the midst of seven golden candlestick like in the son of man buried about the pout from the golden girdle which is a feminist form showing the girdle the thing is over his shoulders but it's down in coverness the girl it's the the women you know gird about the power what now he hadn't had he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth now let me ask you a question i mentioned the other night is brother brown a part of the bride of christ amen you agree with that statement that brother branham was a part of the bride of christ now you'd be silly to say that he wouldn't because you'd be putting him outside of it somewhere and you'd have the doctrines like some of the brothers had gotten that brother brown was an old testament prophet in the new testament age unless doctrines among this message i didn't cover that one on the doctrine here a while back that's a doctrine prevalent among the ministers of the message brother branham was an old testament prophet in the new testament age i said brothers you've got a problem because he may he would be an unregenerated person that's right that's your problem all right but look then revelations 1 10 through 13. would be showing the bride of jesus christ that's right you agree amen you see brother brown would be part of it paul be a part of it irenaeus martin columbo all of them that's what he was seeing not just one church age but he's seeing them all all right so then when you see the bride no wonder brother branham would say let's see he said well will the bride have a ministry and watch what he said she said sure the bride will have a ministry said sure she consists that i'm quoting verbatim of apostles and prophets evangelists pastors and teachers she consists he the bride consists of that because all of those five whole ministries is in the body of christ right so brother brown would be in the body of christ so that would take him out of revelations 1 1 i mean 10 1 that's right see that would put him exactly where he got to pull that back up now i would put him exactly where he's standing his brother brown standing there in the bride of christ see we want to isolate him by itself and he doesn't he wants to be it with the bride of jesus christ and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven pulled with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face where is that where the sun in his feet is filled with the fire now if you make that brother branham in a literal point look what you've got right you got deity right that's right okay but if you make it revelations one the bride she is deity and jeffersonville he was talking about brother branham being deity i said and i pointed over his brother i said if you'll tell me that brother got the holy ghost standing right there that he's as much deity as brother browning taking away the gifts and taking away the signs and wonders you know just as an individual i said then i'll go a long way that brother brown was deity he said oh no brother well i knew who i stopped to do so we don't need to discuss it he had brother brown as deity and the rest of us is not in his i don't know or like the other brother says we're a heist of god maybe so that would be a demon god you know and that's what it is he's not a full god but listen we know that he had a book in his hand that's not brother brandon that's right that's the lord jesus christ in bride home that's right with brother adam was standing there keep on going now and we cried and lord going down to chapter verse seven because anybody don't know the rest of it you might get all of it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophet now who is the voice of the seventh angel okay that's brother brandon amen now we're right we're right we got brother brown in the right order he is the angel to not the ladies and church age he said if you do that he said you make me a pentecost that's where people don't follow the message that's right there's only seven church ages right right there's only seven church messengers but brother brown placed eight church messengers 464 seal book copy it off if you want to all iranians martin clumble luther wesley and elijah you got your seven everybody looks at that and said brother brown was the messenger of the seventh church age he was not the messenger of the seventh church age right but around said the one-eyed black man was the messenger to let to azusa street you want these quotes just go to 464 to see a book marina but when you read it he'll say that there was another great prophet came he said lutheran wesley and he said in another great prophet that wasn't brother brown i'd listen to the quote you want it we'll be glad to get somebody and they could run it up back there in a hurry and give it to you and he says no messenger to the age because the holy ghost came himself in his fullness in the baptism he said he said but at the end of the age at all the other age then the messenger came running around came at the end of the lady of sin amen because you've got to go back into the scriptures of uh you know exodus and all of that and uh especially ezekiel i mean not ezekiel but um leviticus and picking that word leviticus um 25 8. where the seven sevens is 49 and see then you've got to have a messenger to come right amen if brother branham was only the messenger to the zeus street then you have no rapture but it's not nine eight messengers like messengers that we take them to you you get all messed up there's eight manifestations of the holy spirit of god that's right down through seven church ages and i put you where brother brown could bring us the message of eternity okay brother brandon brought the message of eternity you agree with that see then he wasn't a messenger at the end of the ages he was the messenger to come to the end of the age i figured they'd get it by then i preached long huh all right so this is 464 the seal book which is actually run it back down just a hard brother where we can see 1963 324 which runs your paragraph 52 but it's actually 464 of your seal book all right each one of those ages only taken to dip into the holy spirit justification is the work of the holy spirit sanctification is the work of the holy spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit now listen that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the age because the messenger coming to zeus the street with the gifts come on because the holy ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism on his sister's street he came down to give the people the baptism of the holy ghost just like it was in the book of acts right amen not the upper room of the hundred and twenty now the three thousand downstairs we've done priesthood it's split all right because the three thousand downstairs only heard one message they couldn't be put up here at the faith of the father they couldn't be brought up this position they only heard one message but 120 in the upper room are two or three life years and jesus is mentioned all right look what he said but at the end of the ages always end up on the other we find then there then the messenger sent and all these scruples and things are to be placed in to their place all right so then i would solve the problem with me to understand it and to see that but you say well now give us something and that's what i said i was riding up the road and something spoke he said the key is revelations 10 7 verse the first word to pull that up brother revelations 10 7 the key is the first word that's right amen now remember what john is to do trying to express it john is to write down what he sees and hears right right and he wrote in symbols that's right he joined it right and saw in heaven open door and that door was jesus he didn't do that he didn't write white horse rider and that was the antichrist he didn't do that he done exactly what he was told to do right whether he knew it or not what he was doing he had to do what god gave him all right but god knew right that in the end time they'd be a prophet come on he knew there'd be a prophet in the end time to tell what that open door was to tell what that antichrist was that's right all right remember now revelation 10 is already past the opening of the seals they're in six and and going over you got to get to the seven to cover the the i believe it's eight one eight one you're gonna go to eight one to get the seventh seal that's right all right john's over and he sees all these things and a great multitude of people in the redemption of all mankind and remember what john was to do you remember that in his writing chapter 1 john write what you see and send it to the church right amen now that's what it says i and send it to the church so he sent it to us send it to the bride of christ that whatever they could comprehend down to the ages they could handle the part but you know especially in this end time john you're supposed to write it now you've done wrote chapter one two three four five six seven eight nine now how in the world is god going to get that to the bride of jesus christ in the seventh church age for her to understand john what are you going to do john sets our search in his mind i've seen all these things yes they are of god and i've got to get it back to the church age john sees right then as brother branham kept emphasizing he said so thereby the seventh angel must be a prophet you want those quotes thereby the seventh angel must be a prophet for the word to come to so now he's got the key so john writes but he said what does that do with it well if you get your head out of the sand and quit thinking about a billy goat button his head or forgive me what you're sitting on and get your mind into the spiritual mechanical realms of the holy ghost and listen to him that's right how can i get that back there these seven thunders have uttered their voices come on right above it all right all right how am i going to get it back there it strikes john he said but that seven church age messenger will be a prophet that can bring these forwards yes but don't put brother branham in revelation 10 7 it puts him in revelation 3 14. come on 3 14 is a description of the lord jesus christ right the beginning of the creation of god and the messenger to the age and the ending up of all things and what does he say but in the days of the voice of the 7th angel when he begins to sound yep all these things that i've wrote is going to be made known to him and he can bring it to the bride all right are you listening so it doesn't move brother brown to revelation 10 7. he's in revelation 3 14. and going on down to 22 i think it is the last part about you know into the messenger age and the overcomer and whatever overcomer of this age would be now but in the days of the voice that doesn't put brother brown there on another account either is because this message will go to israel there will be two prophets that will open those seals quoting brother brown to israel he said they open that sixth seal anytime they want to which means the plagues and the viles and the torments going to happen under the sixth seal right see these seals are going to israel that's why the first seal says is that the man of sin sitting in the temple of god you better believe we better not be here when that man sits there because if we see him sitting there physically happening you better believe we've done miss the rapture amen and we're in the tribulation right because there ain't no second rapture to take care of the people that miss the first one right so get serious and think about it see this message will go to israel that's revelation 10 7 to that part those two witnesses will pick up this message you want it out of the syllable he said they'll tell them you missed it they said a bride called him sin the seventh seal right the bride caught it she's gone you know the days of the voice of the seventh angel you're not gonna understand revelation 18 4 doesn't have to be come out of her my people israel has got to come out of that antichrist covenant that's right so it's a twofold meaning yes you understand but you see we still hold with our mind but brother dale i don't understand you're so deep i don't see anything deep of what i just brought out that brother branham don't run around don't go to israel that's this just elijah but his message win the fifth elijah will take the message of the fourth elijah right and speak to israel amen that's right right yes that was one thing when i was in israel to find out the jews because i never looked it up and wade did he looked up and preached a marvelous thing on it now and we begin to understand you know the jews when they sit at that table and everything and eating that passover they leave a seat there that's right and it's for elijah because they believe elijah is going to come before the messiah that's right well if moses was the word back there and moses will be the christ that elijah will precede coming with him right so it's all in the message that's right see church is not hard to understand but it's just to get away from our understanding amen well it's got to be over here right brothers i'm taking pushing on the the book of revelations not in in correct chronological order i see i'm sorry your prophet said it was perfectly in order right the book of revelations is perfectly inordinate it don't have to be scrambled around and move back and forth it's in perfect order but now brother branham was only in the revelations 3 14 through the 7th church age and was not over in revelation 10 you would be jugged in your books to try to find something but it's his message in revelations 10 1 is the bride of jesus christ that's what your prophet said well i can't understand that why because you don't have the holy ghost to understand it with you right i'm sorry i'm seeing people by talking like that but i'm sorry it's true if we don't have the holy spirit he can't reveal anything to us oh you just study it all out brother dale i've told you before when that first seal broke to me i was running a job and it took two people to run a man couldn't relieve me for take a break i'd have to come back and hit him catch back up it was so fast take two people to run the job today i was out and yet god spoke to my heart and i scribbled little notes just words until i could come home and check it out you went in your study and brought on your news praying no isaac general motors making a living now may i say a word here maybe that's what's wrong with a lot of preachers in their study they think praying to find something they might need to get them a job go to work they wouldn't be a lazy shiftless bone that's bumming off of the people taking all the money from them that's right amen come on sorry i just saw i just say it like it is and i'm sorry we get to heaven i'll still apologize again we get there we don't have very much to worry about but are you listening see trying to cover that you don't have to move us about right just see where we're at the bride in revelations one now listen i'm gonna say something to you so you have to catch on the bride in revelations 1 is shown on earth that's right all right the book was closed in chapter one the book was closed in chapter two the book was closed in three and we'll get down to it you begin to see what it looks like as it tries to be opened in chapter four five shows it open ten we're not see it's the same as revelations 5 because in chapter 10 the book is open you say but it seems to be up it's open it becomes open well here on earth right until we go there revelation 21 we're in heaven but yet we come right back here to earth wonderful story let me get off of that okay i hope you follow yes all right so let's start and try to pick up something just for a few minutes i know we won't get it down to it we'll finish this afternoon but that's all right look at number five and let's just pick up because these quotes have been given unto you but as a partial point as to proving a voice as to proving a uh open door now we're talking about looking at it in a different light so this is revelation chapter four 1960-1239 oh and noticed john being taken up immediately after the church age was the top of the rapture church don't think that 4-1 is the top of the raptured church okay now immediately after the church age is over this lady will see an age then comes the rapture the church goes up with like john did into the presence of god why because he's at the top calling himself just like jacob's ladder just like stephen's seeing heaven open and there's one sitting on the throne we'll get to that when we get there so you just read chapter four over and over but what does it do and the bride goes up immediately after the church age is over it's like i said isn't it something for us to stand here and comprehend these things before we get there yes the bride of jesus christ has the book unveiled to her but this book is not unveiled to the world that's right the denominations and and the ones in this mention they can't see the book right i can't see these things but then they're still books and scrolls and and all kinds of things like i said i put in a key every once in a while you remember in chapter five you find a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes funny looking lamb that's the bride of jesus christ now look at the next one number six this is taken from revelation chapter four part two you're to read this is two part readings one and two is the two different dates if you'll notice another sixty um 30 or something like 31 this goes over to uh 101 all right 61. we find that after after these things after a minute that after the church ages has ceased then john was solomon's to come up higher come up hither he seen the church ages that didn't mean the church ages would overwhelm we're still here in it right right he sees it over john sees the church age over does everybody understand that and he goes up there's the top of the rapture and he was on earth seeing what was down here now he's going to the heavenlies all right and y'all know someone to come up come up here which means come up here he showed him all that was going to happen in the world of this church age then after the church age was over we find then that john was the type of ever true believer that will be summoned by christ on high that's right summons come up higher he was in the candlestick speaking from them to his church then when the church age had ceased he left the earth and moved up into the heavens and he called his redeemed up with him oh isn't that beautiful oh it makes my heartless jump amen see just because it is written there that that john goes up that doesn't mean that it took place right there he was only typing that right that'll take place the day winkle was that's right you agree that's right the day the bride goes up is when that'll take place who cares what time it'll be i i'm 72. i don't want it to last a long time you know but still what does it matter i don't care if you have to roll me down this house in a wheelchair and i don't even halfway know who i am i'll still be saying praise the lord you know i always told you the other day and i know it don't sound good to people that maybe their families have got it but you ought to look at that person in your family that's got alzheimer's and just love them instead of being hateful to them and arrogant and everything they don't know you know what they don't know wrong they might talk vulgar but that's not their guilty that's that's not right you're look at them in different ways all right now let's do next one there was a voice that called him this is on revelation chapter four which is back the one you know part one there was a voice that called him over that voice i can't get away from that that voice of that one behind him then he looked around here there and he showed him all the church ages because he was standing in the church ages the seven golden candles did and he heard that voice after the church 86 the voice that left the earth went up when he got in the glory he heard him say come up here i'm going to show you what's going to happen from here after that's what the title of the message is after this or hereafter all right now let's see if we can get one more go up to number eight this is pretty good reading paragraph 121 going down this is 1962 31 revelation chapter four now immediately after he showed the end of the age of his work here he went on up into heaven he said i'll show you what's going to be after this after the church agent and like i said john is going to be shown the future right see everybody wants to deal with how far brother one time wanted to know how far did you know everyone said it slanted over 20 feet over there he said how far did they go up i said slanted 20 feet i don't know was it 200 feet 10 000 10 million what's the difference your prophet said in a slant over there about 20 feet where another dimension dementors don't have to be thousands of miles apart they can overlap each other and just run backwards and forward but you see that's what we try to figure things out yeah well what good would it do if i could figure out it it wasn't 20 feet it's 19 and three quarters now boy wouldn't that be something you are smart now how you gonna get over there that good southern language how you gonna get over here how are you going to get that but listen look what he says he says john i can't talk to you down here there now what about the great revelations he's already given him in chapter one two and three he said john you gotta come up here you gotta get away from the earth oh wonderful what he saw right now did you got to get up a little higher i think church it's about time that we raised just a little bit higher in our understanding not to get away from the message no sir but to see what the messenger is talking about john is the type of the rapture did that mean you didn't go up there oh but brother tail blood around the city saw all of us there i agree with him he saw all of us there and i'm not making no joke out of it but he went to hell he saw people there too so which place did he see me and you we got a choice to decide whether we're down there or up there right and the new birth is the only difference i mean how smart we are how much we know about the message it's whether or not we're born again or not but if you're not born again you can't be resurrected sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus right because it takes that new birth all right because i left down there i've come up higher come up here with me i like that we talked about brother branham saying you know when he did and it's a wonderful thing for him to be out there you know when he was hunting and the cloud was taken away into different things and the lord said just come and walk with me amen that's right oh that's beautiful words for him to just come and walk with it well john says come up here where i'm at you can't stay down there and we stay up here and we make this contact aware that this can happen you know what you can understand all right show you what's going to take place you're actually caught up in a vision caught up in the glory see everybody wants to argue whether it was there physically or whether it was their you know a vision and then they split churches over that it's that doctrine yeah split churches over just that doctrine let's see yeah i know it but i know it's not on that one i don't think brother said i don't care whether it goes up before the tribulation or after the tribulation i just want to make sure that i go up his experience now i love that john had an experience amen amen john had the experience of going beyond the curtain of time brother adam had an experience of going beyond the curtain of time right john had an experience right you know john saw itself yes that's well and over in the seal book right but you know that john looked at her and he saw 12 apostles and 12 patriarchs we'll get to that tonight but you know when he gets over into the city he sees the name right now well john's name would be written in one of the stones right now it was one of the apostles he saw his name we'll see can we see our name amen not armand never brought around the side he said because it's not in the bible that way he said well what's going on for the hour look out here and see the economy falling apart see the world falling apart see all this thing happened we shot glory hallelujah we're crazy right amen we're just flat crazy things start falling apart we say praise the lord what hey i'm losing my home i'm losing my heart pray for see we don't read the scripture do we that's right all things work together for thee called according to his purpose just remember no sickness can't come on you unless god allows it and he's got it there for a reason now a lot of the reason might be old age no problem we blame the devil for everything i blame him for wow get an old car you get two hundred thousand miles on what dirty called it bucket of boats we're gonna buy a bucket of boats they're making good money out of it and they're going for that bucket of boats twenty thousand miles a second john's experience now watch his experience john's experience must have been something like that of paul's second corinthians 12 2 4 if you're putting it down ii corinthians 2 4. paul was caught up one day in a into a vision did you know that he saw things that wasn't expedient for him to even talk about 14 years never even mentioned it see but listen at the difference between them now why was it that paul couldn't write what he saw you don't never think that those are the questions i have those are the thoughts i mean you know paul's a prophet why couldn't he write about it see it wasn't time it wasn't time for it to be written now i get it you listen you'll hear the prophet saying that but listen at the difference between now paul and john what's the difference between them right what paul saw he was forbidden to speak on or to put it out to the public and remember brother brown third full not to be made known to the public you know okay right listen what he said oh my i don't believe he could do it he couldn't have caught one time fire for a little trip i took one day i never got over it and never will he saw things that he couldn't talk about i guess he didn't have words too now you see what i'm saying at one time he was caught up in the third heavens though see up in the third heaven right around referred to him zone seven is beyond the curtain of time he said i believe i went to the first heaven that was his word if you didn't need that quote paragraph 124 look how different when john was caught up and seen jesus he was writing in a book what you have seen and give it back send it back to the church in churches but just remember he put it in symbols it wouldn't time then he put it in symbols right now he was told to write it but he put it in symbols right now listen send it back to the church paul was forbidden to speak and john was even asked to put it in a book so it would go all down through the ages oh my it's revealed now to be revealed in this last days it wasn't revealed in his days it's revealed now as we go along that's right paul didn't even write it but john was told to write but he was told to put it in cymbals right i like revelation 2 three that's the church ages and what's going on that's not much that's not really symbols there's a lot of symbols used there but listen we're in the hour for it to be revealed that's right we know what the symbols are but because we know what the symbols are do you know that they say that this message is laid in oral roberts university but it runs a message been told that i don't know they've been there that's hard but i've been told it just died does that give them the revelation what i said about burke's larkin the white horse rider was the holy ghost i mean the water was right with the aircraft did he understand it when he was riding a horse that's right it was in the time of the antichrist system in the trinitarian doctrine all right what are you following them all the experience was like john's they both saw things see now this afternoon we'll get it more into and tie together with even because we can do that the word brother random gills but i'm gonna go ahead and call it out here because some of you will may not be back this afternoon and some on the internet system may not cut back on so we will just give where brother brown says it in the seal book he says it on paragraph 2 or 23 of the breach you know the message of the bricks 637-317 and he says there's something goes on here about this fourth chapter and he says the bride goes up at the end goes up on the third chapter of revelation and does not return until 19 21 or 19. then he goes over to the fifth seal and he repeats almost the same identical thing paragraph 87 on the fifth seal he goes on into the fifth seal paragraph 218 and he says that when this happens that this is not even to us you know then when he gets down to the feast of the trumpets paragraph 38 he says that the bride goes up in revelation 4 1 not single 1921. they done pulling them up to her i'm holding them this evening but you can read them off but just think about it church you and i have the opportunity to understand this message that's right with the same holy spirit that was given on the day of pentecost the little bride of christ can understand the great mysteries and then they'll be very simple john looked up and he saw a door he would see a door he saw jesus but to his mind as a human being it was a door so he wrote down door right over there later he'd see one and call it the beast but that wasn't what he was seeing see john even heard the thunders that's what brother brown said but he was forbidden dry well that's revelation 10 forward he heard the time right you said what daniel heard him well we're looking for thunder it's like something that people in the message looked at them like some kind of they had seven men you know picked out of the message each one was supposed to be a thunder but listen church the revelation was gonna set us three times amen that's right we'll just drop off right here and pick up this afternoon amen and take on these things whenever the rapture comes i just want to be there the prophet places in order gives it like paul's experience what do you think about paul brother brown said in the book of hebrews especially he said paul took and used the old testament symbols to express the book of hebrews isn't that something paul was a great learned scholar he didn't forget all he learned oh man but the bible said he did no no you read it wrong he forgot all it was no good he didn't forget all that he'd read he forgot all of his denominational doctrine and come out with jesus christ you can't erase a man's memory but you can erase from the man the doctrine that we have that's what i'm trying to do you and i and i hope you understood what i'm trying to bring today but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he'll put brother brown over there that puts him exactly where he was revelations three the messenger to the seventh church age and he said but now wait a minute you said he wasn't the messenger he wasn't a messenger to the seventh church age he was a messenger to all right he was to end it all up that's why i love over in leviticus you just you get in there sometimes just read it seven sevens is 49 and you gotta step in the world because there's no way to get out rapture comes in the seventh church age with the seven church ages not the rapture read leviticus 25 8 and then going down to verse 10 and find out there comes a 50. wrote around and declared a message to you and i that message is naturally speaking is a 49 because it's a symbolic but when it's revealed it goes into eternal life what do we think about these things what do you think about the message we've heard so wonderful all the answers that we have needed is right in the prophet's name he tells you how to raise kids he tells you how to be husband and wife right he tells the kids how to be kids in one message and what i love about it is i can just take the computer and i can pull it in there to get a quote and it don't matter to me if one's in 47 and the other's in 65. and i know there was things that he said that he upgraded on what he was thinking on it but he didn't change if he did he told us right but what about a message that fits me it'd have to be the message of god and especially for the brain because there's no other age we've got the ability to print this message and send it to the world that's why it's being done put it on a little bit and send it to somebody they got the whole 1100 sermon or something amen what a day you and i are living in let's stand again 161 it's about 61. we'll get through just a minute is me is get everything ready is want to have a dinner together so any of you the visitors or whatever you're welcome to come and eat with us just fellowship and have a good time you know and just have you know everybody decided to have my wife a birthday time today you know little abby the other day she she turned uh five on sunday but she said i am not five until i get a birthday cake well you couldn't get her to say she was five for nothing she said i'm still four saturday they had her in a birthday thing and she's five now all right danny hadn't admitted yet she's 70. well we got a birthday cake downstairs and i i don't think they gonna put that many candles on it because we'd have a four-alarm fire you know putting it out but she'll officially say after today she's 70. no because that's her time right but let's just pray and go down and eat together and fellowship one with another okay father we thank you for this day and we ask you lord that you would just bless us together in your love your presence as we go down to eat together we ask you to sanctify the food the nourishment of each one of our bodies and that we may all gather together in you we love you and we thank you thank you for giving our wife 70 years lord
