there's many many sicknesses of you know we pray for them continually we hold them up before you because we believe it we believe by your stripes are healed and we thank you for it got us now as we read your words you come and speak to each one of our hearts we love you and we thank you in Jesus name let's go to Ephesians excuse me Peter we can go to Ephesians 1 Ephesians 4 let's go to that one first because it does get the point visions 4 verse 4 or by when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ excuse me through 3rd verse I'm getting all messed up today or there is one body one spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all remember that's the point we're trying to get is one faith one Lord one baptism one faith one thought right all right now let's go to 1st or 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter serving an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness the knowledge of him that have called us to glory in virtue or viral given to us the exceeding great and precious promises now the prophets did these promises that these that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through thus you might be seen in the Lord and His blessing to the reading of the word now we want to pick up our thought if we can with that was why was juggling backers board which way to go but I want you to understand first and read we went to Ephesians that there's one faith one Lord one baptism all right all right now then in understanding they can't be many faiths there's only one faith all right now remember our point and emphasis of what we were trying to bring out this morning faith is the substance the is singular it's not faith is a a substance the Prophet said you know a substance that won't work a substance it's not in something you can walk on you can't depend upon it you can have a substance of the basis of what little bits you can think of for the time but it won't hold when the finality is raised up before you so we won't the faith all right now that was the point the faith are as we read in Peter he says with these of like precious faith all right now that light precious faith is the faith that the that Peter said he had it all right now remember that party said he had it okay to them to have obtained like precious faith with Russ through the righteousness no he had that faith he's addressing it to those with that same faith all right now see if you believe that the old doctrine that there is one years ago that we all faced in a way and in that you know there would no holy ghost' doctrine and and the holy ghost wasn't here like it was back under and and everything that i always had was just a confession or an old testament form of salvation and all of those things i didn't agree with it then i certainly don't agree with it now because that would require many face to be able to place one to each one on but we believe in one faith one substance faith is the substance right these seven are a services now faith is the substance of things hoped for all right now what happens is one day you believe it and it can it was we'd be doing fine you know you can believe it but if that ever passes on through into a deeper room it'll come out to be worth it you actually have the substance of it within your possession sister Jeanne lost her her mr. Scoggins she lost her keys to her car well she searched in really I researched and everything and we all prayed and you know ask God to reveal where it was at and and all like that well it just goes on for a while and it wasn't dire but then all that wants one day she goes in and reaches over to another pocketbook car and there's the key that she had changed some things and done some things and had dropped her her keys down in the pocketbook well you know it was there all the time and she knew somewhere that that was because that's what she taught us is God knows and that's why she prayed God you know where my keys are at was he he knew where it was that to him it was a substance but to her it was a confession that a God that can do all things can bring me to act my keys you know and do well you know what but today she has the keys see today it's a substance all right that's the emphases are trying to make this morning of what we're talking about that those of like precious faith and see is reason I know we used to face that doctrine back there didn't believe well you know you just had a you just had something that you know like an Old Testament person you didn't have the new birth and and all like that and you had to wait till you got up to the top of the pyramid before you could say you had the Holy Ghost and a new birth and times well the I couldn't handle that because to me I'm kind of like you know maybe this basis may be stubborn about it but well let me tell you sister Jeannie as an example then I won't be me stubborn one day she had a confession that she believed in the god that had saved her soul she had been a confession and she had to believe in in the God that that she would bleed in and accepted her salvation but yet she didn't have the substance of the keys but the God that was there he knew right where they were at and all that Stu do is wait until we get all out of the way and then it is hands to things to us and you know and all and if we get out of that part to start with that we're trying to make it work instead of just relax and letting him have it these things will work out all right now that's what I mean by faith being a substance it's something that the Bible says things hope for all right the you hoping for something but yet you don't have it to show to somebody else but then you can come into that position have you ever done that to where you know something's right there you know what it is or our situation you you know it you know and there's no argument of anybody can take that away from you because you believe it well yet you don't have something to produce to somebody else I remember years ago see we were supposed to been out of here in 73 and a half you know and all of those things and and along about that time I had a dream of us having a little girl you know maybe some seven or eight years old this was about 1990 I mean 1972 somewhere other than our 73 it was before the 73 of the half was to come out but yeah I went about told the dream but not only did have a dream of us where the little girl had dreamed with brother Moulton him having a little boy who was ever just about the same size well everybody was laughing at us or at least me because they said well you know 72 or something what I had to dream said the little girl couldn't you ain't you don't miss the rapture because you're gonna you own Pais that 73 of the hive you know you're gonna miss it I said well all I'm doing is what the Bible says the Bible says to tell a dream as a dream all right now that's that's that this tell a dream is a dream so I said all right I'm telling the dream and I saw it well you know it what long term here comes this little girl rolling baby you know and she grows up and no she's sitting back there today well up in the church in Tennessee there there's a little boy by the name of forests that are the most nervous son you know well the thing about it is see I had the substance maybe I didn't go out and tell everybody it's just sayeth the Lord but I had the substance why because I saw it okay whether it was a dream or what I was standing at the house one day and don't I don't know what happened but all at once I looked over it looking out the window - and in Richards houses across the road and I looked over there and I saw Ana I mean Abby so Abby walking through that well look beside of her was this lady walking alongside of her and it was Lisa well I had that better way I don't know but see they had to be a day when that took place because what I saw was a reality well you know they walked a lot of times across her which one was the choice I don't know I ain't concerned about that I'm just telling the story all right see the difference in having a mental concept of something and maybe a dream makes it a stronger concept or taller a vision makes it stronger and stronger each one becomes more and more real to you until eventually you'll walk right into it we'll see to me that's what faith is that's what faith that's the point of faith that you can't show it to somebody else but yet you have it well right you can't show me your new birth no no I don't know come on get the point you can't show me your new birth you see what I can I can show you that I've been a real good person that I don't cut my heart or pants I don't do this out of it we walk right over here to this church and they may be 10 over the earth doing the same thing right yeah it's something that a substance is something when it becomes a reality to you now get this point before we can move on into the next part of the thought when God gives you his own life in the new birth and you know I believe that who always told it because that's what I believe in the beginning I believe the new birth is the birth of the word I believe the disciples took the word as the Bible said and they held it and when it did the Holy Ghost come and fell own it and made that word alive all right I've always told it that way cause this way of always believes it that that is the new birth is the birth the making alive of the word to you just like it would be if you put a grain of corn in the ground and it water comes and things and makes that come alive that's where I believe the new birth is the new birth of that well I I've always believed it that away and always tried to teach it in that form to get you to see you know the the things that I'm talking about all right and by doing that sometimes you know or sometimes you lose people in your thinking because you're thinking of one thing and trying to tell it and others are thinking about faith in another way but just settle down and think about it so that's why I choose to speak this morning that a little bit about there is just one faith there's one Lord there's one baptism now there's many face out there today in the land Baptists Methodists Presbyterians and many many faiths but none of them will line up in the scriptures as being the faith all right so that's what we're trying to find now is the faith the prophet in stature of a perfect man says now the the fact that all of us are searching out the way to find the way to God and the things that he wants us to have all right because that's that's a substance but see we're gonna have to stand here somebody is now why can't we say it's us somebody's gonna stand on the earth one day and say I'm changed but everybody gonna be looking at them and say you ain't yeah well then go see what you're talking about um something's gotta happen what do you think the change is gonna be you know it's got to be the point that somebody has to see it believe it and walk into it because as I said a minute ago now you can't show your new birth because other people can impersonate that just the basis of showing the same thing you're showing or I'm trying to show and not have one bit of Christianity if you read the statue of a perfect man you heard the Prophet say what said a lot of people can have a portion of these virtues and not even be born again right now a lot of people can have a portion of these things and it looks like true Christianity you know somebody in your mind you're thinking now that you can think of of that they are a real good person real sincere real sweet humble and everything and even make us ashamed of our own lives and things you know and know that they're not a believer of the truth right but yet as far as their lives and they're doing it looks good well we'll see that's the confession without a possession that's that part of what I would have said I want to go that we can confess something but if we don't have it within us to see that the way that we need to have it then all we have is a confession but when Christ comes to live in you as Paul said it's not our that liveth but Christ that liveth in me right now that's the faith all right no trying to get that point so now hold that hold that point of what we've got now see then as a we've read he said of like precious faith like precious faith which like means the same right so it's the same faith so then I've always taught it to you everybody that gets the new birth gets it identically the same I know you're not gonna read a lot of people back up for me when I make statement by there I'm talking about the birth I ain't talking about what you've done ever baby is born the same water breaks blood breaks life comes right now this difference is in the way that happen or what breech babies caesareans all kind of thing but even in cesarean baby it's still water blood live come on the ever new birth is the same because that would be you'd be dealing with something different what kind of what could you make it but if you make all of them the same then you don't have to worry about the birth yeah but I just don't see it that way I I said I'm sorry that's that's just mean okay but I'd like to hear you explain it because you see you know yourself you're gonna have to face what I've taught for 40 years that the new birth is a new birth the new birth is the birth of the word the new birth is Christ coming living in you now you gonna make anything else than that because you're still on the basis of what is the new birth I cried I spoke in tongues I shot it had a good feeling you're not listening to what said the new birth is the new birth see then everybody has the new birth the same so then Peter is speaking of them he said them of like precious faith in other words the same kind of faith there's not but one faith there's not many face you want that I've got them laying in the park garden something at home you want a bunch of more bread around talks about like precious faith 26 times and see you can't you can't say hey faith it's D faith it's something that's real to you yet is your new birth you can't explain that to somebody right people look at you and you say well well I'm so happy and I'm rejoicing and having a wonderful time in my salvation and I like at it everything is just so wonderful well it's your right to money I said that one time to a lady I said the Bible said all things work together for the good you know she said how could it work together with what I've got well it couldn't it couldn't work for her in that point because she didn't have what I'm talking about see a Christian should be a Christian it don't make no difference what we enter how and you can only do that through Jesus Christ you can't do that through yourself see we're defeated nobody's a match for the enemy right you said well boy bless God he can't tackle me no he can't Agins already got you if that's what you think he's already holding you all right now faith then being a substance and that substance of your new birth is the same substance that everybody received because everybody's had to birth of the word you know what I'm talking about each age come down no matter what you want to deal with what little bit it was here or what it was over here or quote this over here you know you know it gets silly how people can quote things so wrong but you followed me through now so we'll move on the point I believe ever new birth is the same but some cried some shouted some life some you know many different manifestations came forth that's that's not but the birth is the same uh-huh see because that's what it's saying one faith one Lord one baptism then that way it places it to her we're all the same god it doesn't make a difference of this group over here or that group over there all right so now here's Peter as we get to our point now here's Peter riding in the scriptures and no novice was ever used to write the word right always he never used any of those it would always somebody if you'll check it out except Paul wasn't there be somewhere else but God revealed the word to him when all the rest were used were basically those from the Upper Room experience of the 120 to write the word yeah because the novice is not to write the word no matter how good he can be he still doesn't have that foundation see Peter had something that was real he had a substance faith right he had something that was real okay and what did he want to do now why was he writing to second Peter he gets into first Peter and he talks about you know by being born again I believe in 2nd Peter on 1st Peter in where he talks about being born again and you know nothing all right but he comes to 2nd Peter and now he's writing a letter to these people all right and to tell them now listen to what I'm saying what's he telling them not telling them they need to be born again because he says they have the like precious faith they have the new birth he's telling them how to get where he's at are you listening where's he at we're all born again baby start right here where did Peter name start right here but remember the story I've taught it to you over and over three and a half years before they ever got their experience to be made manifest now you can't argue that point right three and a half years that they followed the Word of God to me that's why it's like that God put it that away to where those people could be anchored in the word and then when the Holy Ghost would fall it would positionally place them to a place to where they would have a greater understanding or be able to be used this said about it they were all there except Paul but Paul goes to the backside of the desert stays back there about fourteen years one time he says three and a half of another and he's talking and when he comes out he's preaching the same thing that Peters preaching right while coach Paul was a prophet he could be taken God took him back there and took him up the plane said no man didn't teach him the Holy Ghost taught him the Peter said well nobody can win no no wait a minute the Lord Jesus taught him all right for three and a half years then he comes to that place so what's Peter doing Peter is going to tell these people how to get where he's at right now as you go down to these kids are graduating and things you know and you go get a job well boy it's nice to walk in and you know that's the way to do today about it you know kids go walking in you know flop down put your feet up on the dish and I said well I want to tell you a little bit about I know all about it I've done read two books done studied all about it what you want me to do mainly go out the door but you wouldn't do that what what happens that you don't get the job why because you think you know something all right and by thanking you knowing something you turn around the shows you don't know it right no I mean I can I can take my shoes off and count to 20 but wouldn't it be something to minutes Linna brother do you ret and him telling me to do this that in the other unsafe water you need to do that why I'm gonna do what I'm still alone they come on folks I'm still on the cutting and taping with the computer and that's no joke I don't have them here with me but they're laying in the office all these notes was cut and I don't top it up and get it over here and move it over there and cut in his pace and I cut my own I cut it across and I tape it over there I cut it another one across and I tape it to it I'm still taping and cutting and pasting taping all right see the point that I'm wanting you to see who was Peter talking to he was talking to somebody he says that had the same faith he had now right now he was talking to people that was of like precious faith are the same faith he had now don't get the amount of degree involved into what you're doing because it doesn't work that way you don't want to mean it well he had more this way had more that way he was taught for three and a half years yes he had more natural natural understanding of the kingdoms and the things than they did but here comes the Apostle Paul and what is Peter say he said Paul says things it's hard to be understood that others rational with you know he said in other words I don't wrestle with it I just kept my mouth shut but I know he knows more than I do well where to get it he got it from God all right now so listen to the points so let's read this and unless let's just go back and we'll read from where we did this morning so go ahead two brothers Philip number number one on the stature of a perfect man this is start paragraph 31 through about 37 or 38 and he's bringing the first part of it and what he's talking about to me is an amazing thing because brother branham in teaching the message and listen you go back to 99 I'll say 56 because I don't remember that one Intervale in arrest Intervale and that brother branham is talking about a people that God wants to bring to be a living moving instrumentality of Christian faith 56 he didn't have to wait - come over here - no a lot of times he he knew a lot of things but look at the thing he didn't catch and I'll show it look at what he didn't catch okay because this is the way he says it so listen let's read it now we're approaching the seven seals and this is a message on teaching the ties of man in that's going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and it's going to be in that church age that eternal church age at the end of the seals there we know that we have seven trumpets seven plagues vials and so forth then we get into as we go along well we're waiting for more room and all for the people huh I thought this would tie in and listen to it I thought this would tie in just where I was expecting I didn't expect to draw this skeleton please draw it out 2nd Peter right add to your faith virtue or knowledge to everybody that's what he draw it out right but he said I didn't expect to draw this one because it was not in his understanding to use it right cuz listen to it I didn't expect to draw this skeleton but the other day I was with some precious friends of mine caucuses down in Kentucky I went down thought maybe get in one more dead squirrel long before the season closed I was up in the woods with my friend Charlie standing there and riding in brother I didn't even see a squirrel I think I scared him away when I got to shouting up there in the woods this is what come to me now watch you boys and sister Nelion Margie when I told you I'd tell you Sunday when I got to it that's what come to me on a message I was going to speak on okay now I know the rest of it would tie right into it now a message he was going to speak on he already was speaking it brother branham in there that's my point you back up to 47 and listen to brother branham he's talking about Christianity living the life of Christ and the thing in a high rim than any anybody you ever heard talk about it right because that was what caught my attention the years of what seventh graders education or something guy and he's teaching theologians the word and they're sitting in amazement listening to him then with any common sense course rest of them laugh you know and he's in the 40s he's teaching things that people never thought of he's teaching adoption in the 40s and the 50s natural programs at 62 listen to my point he was already had these things in mind but yet he didn't have it down and using second Peter to be able to put it faith virtue knowledge to him right but he already knew that that's what he was a teaching he was teaching the statute of a perfect man back in the 50s and the 40's but he didn't bring it down as to second Peter and using the chat away you said well then what does that mean that means a lot to me because as he begin to see things and they begin to open up he begin to see more on what he was talking about more of what he was trying to bring out throughout the services that he was trying to preach it to the people and teaching them and then as he starts bringing it out it brought unfolds to more and more and more all right so that was what he was saying he said now I didn't expect to use this what said I got this up in the woods one time together second Peter well all of the things that he had was trying to bring out about the life of Jesus Christ living in each individual and not being that we went to church now come on you know what I'm talking about true now just don't bulk on me listen you know some of you older one especially you went into Baptist Methodist Presbyterian even Pentecostals and you just set to iron your home and you heard sometimes you well that's a good point but basically you just enduring then you tell me I'm wrong on that I'll meet you today a judgement but I don't mind telling you what I've done I wanted to get on with it and tell us something good because I read the book that could at least read the book my brother was a Methodist preacher and then he could beat anything around the country as I appreciate he had a gift and I try to hear him other guys although had problems with his Playboy magazines that was sitting in his house but that was you know I ain't joking his kids gave him a this big old thing to put his books in one time for Christmas ain't tell no joke I'm just saying that's the way people was that's the way life was back there we went to church we just done the best we could do well but yet here come a prophet me that's what I said this morning when I come into the message I didn't say I had to baptism in the Holy Ghost when that man started talking about the baptism and Holy Ghost I knew I didn't have it yet I had seen great things take place in my life I have seen things happen to her that it was marvelous seeing God when I was about 11 years old standing in a church I can talk about what God done for me we yet when I heard that man started talking about it Christ I began to see Christ in a greater realm than I'd ever seen him in my life and when I did I realized right then I don't have what this man's talking about but now sorry but to most people when they come into the message they just come into the message and say I believe run-around was a prophet well you better believe I believe he was a prophet like I said this morning I've read six books and listened to tapes and one day you won't try I ain't joking I spent my first two or three years in this message just locked down on reading and studying brother Colley sitting there he knows because he had my books and things was right there with him and I could set her ever night and read what you see there was something the man was saying about the Holy Spirit that I knew I didn't have it because he was talking about something personal we was talking about we're going to heaven one day glory hallelujah were going up to heaven and like Wade tells you about you know people saying let's ain't that somethin today granny is walking on the streets of glory she up them down through this or they're healed or whatever you know you know Oh granny ain't doing that ain't puttin her no elsewhere that's just a point that that's an old way of looking at it like you think grandma's up in heaven shouting up down through the woods no I don't know what she's doing but that's that's the point but listen now get the point of what I'm saying he knows that he has been teaching the depth of Christianity and trying to get people to see Jesus Christ and then he sees the statue of a perfect man and it opens up as a way to help them but we thought we got everything when we believed right didn't you then you think you've got everything code you want to shut the preachers hand I mean did you know when you were in the denomination I'm asking you did you know you needed to study God's Word to get any growth development or was you just going to church because everybody else went to church right then my life was dedicated to that my 23 years ago age I was made a deacon in a Baptist Church which generally didn't make a deacon until you at least 45 that's no joke they seen I meant that much and they knew it I was teaching the adult Sunday School classes the Deacons wives and the husband wives are what was in those classes and Here I am this the young boy they seen that that I had a desire I always had a desire for God's Word but I couldn't find nobody else that had anything there wasn't a lot of Pentecostals around us one or two in Gainesville at the most nowheres else was any thing to go to me and we just done the best we could do but when brother Branham began to talk about not a God up in heaven one of these days were going to heaven we're gonna go to the happy hunting ground you know and we're all and that's why they preach like I've told you I've heard him preach on the put on the whole armor of God I've heard that streets meat I don't even like to read that scripture because I've heard everywhere in the world get that armor on and I never didn't know what the armor was they didn't either ain't joking telling the truth all right let's see a prophet when he comes along he catches something he catches what Peter was doing Peter was talking to people that were born again that's what he said those of like precious faith he was talking to people that were born again and to try to tell them how to get where he was at well is that not what the Prophet done when the prophet saw this thing is not to not that the point that he's trying to even today when you put a tape on or whatever isn't he's still not trying to get you and me to come to the position he was in Jesus Christ to last side everything and put it in Christ and walk into the word every time I hear a tape I hear him still saying that because he was trying to teach us how to get where he was and that's what I said about policy Paul he can't get it from Peter then he leaves and goes in the desert but he's after I buy several guard and God gives it to him and brought him out of our world brother Brian said they were teaching the same thing no faith like precious faith now let's go ahead and run it on up to we can get to my old subject this morning is based on faith so run it on up let's get to where we was this morning back down oh are you going every way we're going up or down all right now listen come down just a little bit further other way on their way okay we'll get to this point in a minute but I want you two to start here to where we can start talking on that he's talking about a divine nature now we're gonna get to that in a few minutes if we get time they talking about the promises he's reading the second Peter and watch what he says the world we've escaped now he's already he's addressing this to the church now the church is them that are in Christ Jesus right the churches were born to get believer he's addressing his message framed on back down called is there's more pure paragraph there anyone sorry about that brothers okay holdin back up the other way now back up to where we get okay I'm gonna speak on come a little father I get them all mixed up because I said up and they say down do them down is up we're rolling come on come on come on keep coming yeah I hold it right there now look at what rudder on I was doing he's reading second Peter and what does he say notice he's saying that I have obtained this faith and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like precious faith in other words the same faith he's saying I have the faith I have obtained this faith and I'm teaching them how to take what they've got and a growth development that was to them that obtained the like precious faith it's it's not to the outside world this is to the church see those that are in Christ Jesus all right now I emphasize over and over this morning I'll do it one more time the Bible is not written to a sinner it only tells the sinner he's lost it's not written to him it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus it's written to born-again believers those born-again believers only one can understand remember the scripture this morning no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be why by the Holy Ghost in brother Brennan said by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the only way you can know that Jesus is the Christ see the only way you can have the like precious faith is to have the new birth they didn't listen it's not to the outside world this is to the church see those that are in Christ all right those that are in Christ now roll it on up and we'll try to pick up where we were reading from keep on going now pull it back down and we'll stop here and then we'll our you ago let this soak real deep now not preaching this morning we're just teaching this lesson and I hope everybody is satisfied with like precious faith Peter says I have that faith and I'm addressing this to people that have that faith and then he's going to tell the people how to become where he's at in the stature of a perfect man and then he goes in add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance etc all right now watch him watch what he calls it that that's so real deep now I'm not preaching this morning we're just teaching the lesson divine nature let me read that fourth verse again so you won't miss it we're very giveth whereby are given unto us exceeding great promises that by these these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now this person he's talking about how is it you can escape the corruption that is in the world through us how can you escape it the only one way to get born again right if you're not born again you're not escaping the corruption that is in the world you're part of the corruption all right see the point of what I'm keep driving it look having escaped the corruption that is in the world see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning to find out what is the way what is God's requirement not just a person in here that loves garden we you know want to be good and everything no but a divine nature okay now let's take that from what we were on and continue our thought a divine nature there's only one one divine there's only one nature we have any concern and that's the nature of God so Peter sees telling them those of like precious faith all right now there's just one faith then go ahead to number one a I'll get them all messed up and I keep pulling it but that I like it at least we can do it go to there years ago we're coming up to it now hey its name yesterday pulling up and I think I got it marked on may not but that's alright now in the very but now underway to roll it on that yeah here we go I said what kind of a faith this guy he's talking about in red rounds explaining to me to tell you you know something about guarding things and a brother says well that's against my faith now what Fred run says what kind of faith do you have there's only one faith one faith one Lord one baptism that right see there's only one faith and that's Christian faith that's right there aren't no Methodist faith ain't no Methodist and Baptist faith and Pentecostal faith and Catholic faith being different it's just one faith and that's faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that should be as simple enough for the children to understand huh there's only one faith so ever born-again believer has the same faith are you with me and all of that this morning that's sad to get say that ever born-again believer it's the same faith because that's the new birth faith is a revelation it's a revelation of God's Word and Gudrun says you can't be saved without a revelation see then you say well what now that's where we get to the point I was back in trying to get you to see then we said well what kind of revelation I need I need a revelation of Daniel 7 new weeks or the CEO director okay sorry but that is what I think brother Branham wasn't talking about a revelation of the seals is what we're getting born again by they hadn't even broke in the years and he was teaching all these things what's he talking about it's a revelation Christ the mystery of God revealed what is the new birth brother branham he said the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you they needn't say anything about sealed 70 weeks or whatever so get it out of your mind well what revelation I need tell me what book to read brother Dale where where I can can get a great faith dart in Genesis 1 when you get through the hour start over in 47 on the prophets message or being alone together you're gonna get a faith right at least you'll get something okay what kind of a faith there's only one faith it's just one faith it's one new birth it's one birth of the word now listen see that it's not a seals being revealed it makes you an uber it's Jesus Christ being revealed which is the seals the plagues the thunders the vials of things being revealed right but it's a person being revealed to you not a doctor nor an idea or a concept it's a revelation of Jesus Christ person to you he's a person if you ain't never seen him like that that's see that was what when like I said when the Prophet started preaching and I started listening then my mind went back to when I was 11 years old I heard a man talking about the God I saw I'm sorry phim I thinks that's the exalting whatever I'm just telling like it is you do what you want to but I saw something back there not a person not a I saw an image more and from that day on I looked for that person well you know where I found that person right where he was all the time in the word I found him right in the book that I had called the Bible and then would I begin to grow into that that was why I had such a burden to try to understand the Bible I wanted to try to teach others what little bit I saw from it and talk about it because it was just something real to me it wasn't imagination or a thought and see everybody's not made that way come on I can quote murder random but run said everybody's not made to the basis that they see visions or how dreams or do you think he said that's this differs and individuals it's not made for us all but you do have your own experience you're supposed to have your experience not mine don't seek my god seek your God the one that's trying to need to talk to you and then maybe one day you'd wind up and be able to find him the word that you'd find him walking right beside of you in such a presence until it's beyond all things variants God walking right side of you he never had it it's great thing I've turned him in a day and look for it turn around keep walking you always kept up with me cuz listen Church I'm trying to tell you about your new birth I'm not talking about some great doctor at least you were a pointer whatever it's amazing thing when the Prophet first said that he said Jesus's first doctrine was you must be born again and I thought oh God what it is to be well look one faith one Lord one baptism like I said this morning if you've got two souls you've got two gods because you'd have to have a soul God for each soul if you got two Lords you'd have to have two guards because you got then that's how simple it is if you understand and that will take away doctrines from you you have a brother Dale I know what the Bible said we'll go ahead quote it you don't quote it for you the Lord said unto my lord [Music] that'll run said one day Jesus would be speaking and another time said the father would be speaking that's no problem just need to get a revelation it's just one come on okay now just one faith but Peter now seems to be speaking when he speaks of the fact of it being the like precious faith and then he he pulls up his point and as he brings his point up he begins to talk about this divine nature this divine nature now wouldn't we all want to have a divine nature isn't that that not our gold our thoughts is to have a divine nature a nature of the divine do we want to make it some kind of great dish with all we see vision as we see this I can't I can't talk for vertebrae numbers I'm talk for myself what a little bit of ministry that God has given me it drove me and grey-headed because I know what it is and that's why I've tried to explain it and that's when you go gray head it's trying to explain it to see to got to get people to see what you're talking about look having escaped the corruption of the world having escaped that the lust and corruption of the world you're above that well because you're born again now that's now that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that has escaped these things see the corruption of the world he comes up with a divine nature I will start on number two they don't you pulled up to three but will let's read number two which is under stature a perfect man paragraph 46 45 43 you got to be so in love with him until when he you asked for something he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit so you want and the only way you can do that is to become a partakers of his divine nature right then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you particulars of his divine nature partaker is part taker you know not just taking a part because you can't part out God it's per taking of his nature within you it's just not a part well I got a little bit more than you got no that's not the point that's you've become to a partaker of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you protectors of divine nature and look here having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust that's petered out he's reading it escaped it see who it's to it's to the church them who are in Christ has been exalted above these things not he exalted himself but Christ brought him up well then that can only be talking of a born-again believer how could it ever get started that the stature of a perfect man that they could teach it the way they did back then that you don't have nothing well one of these days you'll get this one day then naturally they're saying one of these days I'll tell you you know twenty days I'll tell you when you got it they because that's one of them little other words then all right number four off the statue of perfect man he says Peter is saying here how that we must be partakers of his divine nature now each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God stature of a perfect man that we might be partakers of Christ's divine nature these mortal body that we could be partakers so well that's impossible for us to be partakers you don't believe you have the nuber if you have the new Burke you have the birth you have the the life of Christ but then you have within you the very life of Christ they keep on going statue of a perfect man they can roll them the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit that we can become into the divine nature of God then we become a dwelling place for God I'm down on partner still owner controlling your your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love and God filled you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature he changes your carnal nature into his nature then you become a new creation a divine nature if you're born again today then that just gives you a earnest right part payment gonna call it but it should start you to desiring more of God you should desire more of God today than ever in your life not be so wait a minute or down-and-out it for brother Forney says wowsie wowsie woo why do all these things out and then to me fellowship through Redemption so beneath the blood and be filled with the Holy Spirit and by becoming partakers of the divine not a partaker of the church a partaker of the divine the divine nature changing your own vile nature into a nature that loves God who believes every word that God has said protectors of his divine nature what about it approach to God if you ever really come to God and got a taste of the heavenly gifts of God for takers of His divine nature why you could no more become a sinner again unbeliever than a stalk of corn could become a cocklebur his divine nature be partakers of his divine nature in that our desire to be a Christian and Peter is addressing is now see we're using this called the next message will pick up statute of perfect man we're bread around and says now what's the first thing we need to do he said we need to have faith and be born again you said we're writing that you're talking about the new boy I'm talking about the new what the new birth is when you receive it it is the divine nature of Almighty God but he puts you to a position to start growing it puts you to a baby in Christ wouldn't be nice to try to think that were grownups the prophets that we're not growing up were just babies right it's a divine nature be of those of like precious faith in other words Peter was saying I have that faith we read it and I'm teaching this to people who have that same faith now what's he going to teach we'll drop right over in verse 7 6 or 7 and he says and besides this add to your faith virtue starts a growth development of a Christian to explain it to us of what we have need of and it's like I've said to you Paul and Peter talked the same thing Paul puts it more in the adoption on stages because he covers it through the Romans and the things and the pre destinations and the adoptions and things peter is telling us how to become that how do we become the divine nature of God by yielding to him and accepting what he's done for us by loving him and wanting to walk so close with him until we lose all the other things come on church Peter and him never done it jesus never taught it never the Prophet never taught no religion that would take you so beyond till you won't even have no remembrance or no problems or or no troubles what did the Prophet say he said people tell you those things so they'll tell you you get born again all your troubles to solve all your things are over without everything if you just give he said that's a lie he said that's what when he starts that's when the devil gets on you is when you start claiming you're born again he'll start getting on to you trying to make you break down but if we can become partakers of his divine nature by accepting his word no one more last word if faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and the new birth is a very substance of Almighty God living within you then that puts Paul correctly when he said is Christ in you that's what he said he says Christ in you well that should be what we want is Christ in you the hope of glory right and then let him take care of the things see we get so involved in all of the mêlée my house and say well water we do here if we're the bride we're here because you're in that mealy-mouthed down-and-out condition so get out of it is that straight enough B how many has been able to keep the faith now you can't say that's one thing you you're welcome to the pulpit to get up here and say that this man has ever been down and out on the word you're welcome to come here and tell brother Dale you're down and out on no I'm down and out with people yeah but not on the word I have never had a down and out day on God's Word it's God every day and he reveals himself when you do that then you can just get up in the night and walk through the house and say lord I love you just come and help us Lord we got to get out of here this thing's falling apart but you know what I do you know what I do mostly I pray one prayer all right see Lord you saved my family why the kids grandkids great-grandkids know I do that cuz he told me one day said you'll be there with your offspring now you believe what God told me whatever that's up to you I don't care won't matter to me they ain't gonna change nothing he told me said you'll be there with your offspring well your kids gonna be saved because of your kids I didn't say that because Bible saying it and putting it to the point that means they're going to be more hindered than anybody else to try to come to that place right so for me to say it is not the bragging point is the point of second you're gonna get it that's June sometime when Wade would come walking around I told her I said every time I look at him I said I just look at him I grin I just grant this welcome you know why because the Lord doesn't told me he'd be there you ever look at it like that you ever look at your kids brother right when you see them they just all kind of go what no they and you look at them and say lay it on Lord these are daylights out of them well bring them to yourself you see that's the promise the Lord you made me a promise that I'd be there with my offspring it's up to you I'm not arguing with him I'm reminding them of what he said you said it I believe it all right no there's another prayer that goes with that Lord all these things that are taking place you said it was for our perfection you promised us that we'd have troubles and trials will never form but you promised that we'd come out of it victorious so I just remind you of what you say it I just remind him of what he said well we've been doing pretty good so far we hadn't just fell apart cause all these things everything else and the message people fell apart we've just been going on we went through made it through the seventies we made it through the eighties we made it through the nineties we made it to the 2000s and we're still going still rejoicing and saying thank you Lord right call musicians take on these things like precious faith puts us to a point that our desires and thoughts is for a divine nature a nature of God to be given to each and every one of us do you realize what you're praying do you understand what I've just explained you realize if you prayed maybe sometimes the way I do you'd stop praying because have you ever prayed for trouble to come your way no no no no no no no no no oh you're not listening hey you're not listening to what I'm saying you're taking it the wrong way do you think I won't in trouble to come I don't know I'm the world work I don't like trouble what is that word for autistics or whatever in the end you know they don't like changes and they don't like this that in the other well I've been that way all my life they they didn't develop that name huh I've been that way all my life cuz I don't like trouble but if it's gonna take it to bring us to where we need to be bring it on bring it on put us to the position we're supposed to be act let's come to realization of who we are and what we're doing here that's not asking for trouble that's knowing trouble is going to come our way right are you listening if you pray for a God to send you patience brother Larry you all patients we want to get started now yeah right and I'm not joking tribulation worketh patience right you won't pay since you're asking to be put under trouble you're asking to be put down and right what are you willing to take it when it comes are you willing to rejoice and say thank you lord when brother idolater state with one day at rogen my heart he said to think that if I can even think about my name being mentioned in heaven he said just to think
