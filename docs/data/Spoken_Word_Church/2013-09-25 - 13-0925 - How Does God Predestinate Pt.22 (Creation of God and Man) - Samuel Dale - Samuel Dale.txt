========================================

oh hopefully the Eyes of My Heart amen now to see you see you lying shining in the light of your voice your power and love okay holy holy holy loving in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy he's worthy in me holy holy holy holy holy Lord holy holy holy I want to see you amen amen and amen and if that's the desire of your heart then God will fulfill it good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn what we've been reading in Romans eight and then we'll go to Colossians 1 and then we'll go to Wade's favorite scripture Genesis 1. so we didn't make plans to preach the way he did Sunday after afternoon and all on the thing and I told him I said use a lot of the quotes that I had written down to use you know so we'll just continue on I'm I'm like this like I told someone one time they said something about said we might preach on something you're trying to preach on I said don't worry about it that won't hinder me that'll help me I'll just keep right on going down the road because I don't I don't change just cause somebody comes along preaches on something I just keep right on preaching because I want you to see what's on my heart and my mind you know to understand amen so just remember we appreciate the Lord being with us giving us the rain and thing that he's given us and and thank him for touching their wife she's a whole lot better able to to get around and everything better and those uh real bad uh things of where you know whatever you called it jerking and all is is it's better so we thank the Lord for that we pray that the Lord will bless in all things because I believe that he sent his word and healed us and we just pray one for another and hold each other up and he'll take care of the rest of it right so amen remember these any other announcements that we have to make but anyhow pray for these ones that are going through the trials in the test it's like I told them down there tonight so you know I don't count because it uh I'm 73 and and your body's wearing out I don't count that you know I I count that just to being under the curse I don't count that as being a well the devil's really after me well he's after everybody in the world and because you know this that age I just counted the fact that you know that he's given me the opportunity to believe his word and then that way I can just keep right on going and thanking him for healing me and delivered me and he'll take care of it because I believe that don't you amen so let's pray father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us we thank you for Calvary thank you for the atonement thank you for all things thank you for the Healer the deliverer the god to our lives and thank you for saving us mainly Lord because that's greater than anything else and we pray that you'd bless us tonight in speaking of your word that you'd come on the scene to the people and Quicken that word Lord and then doing that then truly they would be healed by the revealed word because we believe it and we thank you and we just commit everything to you Lord remember the sick among us because there's many many things that nurses to Anna Lord doing a whole lot better and we pray that you just continue to make that everything okay and just have your way with all of us we love you we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and guide us in Jesus name amen and like I've told you uh I'm still in a jug inside my head with you know water I reckon on my eardrums or something so if I get a little loud pull it and do whatever you have to control it because I I can't I don't know why I don't know how I lied to holler you know so if I holler too loud y'all tell me huh Romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called in whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us they don't want to be an amen to all of us all right look at Colossians because we want to pick up a thought just a little higher tonight and move up Colossians 1. is speaking about Christ it is not speaking about the flesh man Jesus is speaking about Jesus Christ the Christ here see because you'll see that he creates all things in the flesh didn't create all things you know uh you know so we we see what it's going to verse 13 who who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image what exact likeness or exact person right it was the image of the invisible God the firstborn of ever a creature now watch that the first born of ever creature now remember that when we get back to our thought in a minute for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist all right so we know now this as I said that's not talking about the flesh man Jesus that's talking about the Christ amen the Christ is the Creator God right so now we go to Genesis 1 26. and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over ever creeping thing that creep puts upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them let's read the next verse we generally just read those two and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the father of the earth and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now in case I forget it going on through the message uh as I said we a lot of times we don't use verse 28. but read it as what it's saying and he blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply now that's not a physical multiplication that comes on over after you bring the body into being and they were told to multiply and replenish this is not a physical creation there it is a spiritual creation and you know we'll get to that point as we get along and to see now to try not to back up too far but I've been on this a while of trying to get you to see and we went through uh Sunday morning there on Christ the ministry of God's reveal how that wrote around said God had a plan and a purpose that it was going to achieve to see his attributes displayed and he said and we see how this unfolded itself down unto this present hour that we are living all right so then it's being revealed or made known down to where we are we're not in the day of the revealing of the just shall live by faith we're not in the days or the revealing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that came on Azusa Street we're in the day of the revealing of the entire word of God to the Bride of Jesus Christ to bring her to a change of the body to bring her to completion or finish to make it all to be known unto us in this day and I remember I had mentioned this in a few things when you think about it God's first creation is always his example creation and see each creation Begins full grown now don't get on over in and try to run with your mind and think and we'll get to those things later on to New Birth and all but think about it that Adam and eve were a grown man and a grown woman all right then think of the church on the day of Pentecost was a full-grown Church all it was missing was a headstone well that was because it was not a day of it so we're supposed to be coming as we'll get to in a minute and the prophet will be talking about it and he's talking about this of what we're the creation and he says that that's why the whole world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God see for this day to where the people of this day would get the revelation of the word of the hour that we're living all right to some people they are just hearing the message of the just shall live by faith some people are hearing sanctification some people are hearing the preaching of the gifts you know all right some people are hearing that God sent a prophet well all that's well and good and we we believe that we're not in the days of just even as to God sent a prophet we're in a day when the prophet said recognizing your day in its message Luther recognized his day and was not afraid of the world and confounded the world with his message Wesley took that and went on the Azusa Street gifts the prophet has had his day and time but it's up to you and I now to to get into the word for our day and I laid it out as perfectly as I could see because some people are just hearing the message here to be able to get this so I'm hearing it to get this someone yearning to get this but some are hearing it in its point of to bring forth in the end time all right now so then he begins ever creation with a full grown right now we spent a whole message or more trying to express how that we read of the or we read in Revelations 3 14 the beginning of the creation of God but you've got beginning and creation both in the same sentence but neither one of those are implying a uh part of like starting something it's explaining the revealing like in the beginning was the word what does that mean in the beginning was that time that it wasn't the word no it always was the word all right so then the word beginning and the word Creation in scriptural terminologies is not speaking about uh just the beginning of something and well it started right here now that started or exactly on you know something like that no it's meaning something being revealed or made known coming into being that can be comprehended because the great Eternal never had a beginning right right well yeah we'll read in just a second the quote where Wade was there on Sunday that God is his first creation well was there a time there was no God and then he created his own self and he brought that's pollywogs and and all of these Darwin's and garbage cans because that's mentality of man trying to figure out by words think about what's being said see there was a time if you and I were not did not have eternal life we had to receive a new birth but yet when we received that new birth that eternal life always was eternal so what was it doing the birth brought you an eye to a position that natural life could not bring amen it brought us to eternal life and in understanding then we can see what's going on all right so now remember creation and beginning it's not a starting point of anything as much as it is to see something as it begins to unfold the man you know like I was bringing out Wade was bringing it out you know television was in Genesis where'd it come from if it wouldn't but where was it it was in components in the Earth right right the automobile was in the Earth where did it come from did it come to the Moon Mars or somewhere no it came from the Earth it was already there it just wasn't brought together in the form that it could be comprehended or usable right thing now is to that place all right now we've been studying then the point I wanted for the last couple of messages is if we can follow as God unveils something not they well he begin this no just get that out of your mind and get to thinking what I want you to think about is the time that there was no comprehension of God because there was nobody there to comprehend him you know that would be sensible well yet even you and I as we came along in our life and and we begin to comprehend a little bit God opens the eyes of our understanding and we begin to read the word and now we can see things a whole lot more clearer right than what we used to see why because it's unfolding or unveiling or being revealed being made known whatever thoughts you would be running it all right and I made this statement that I want you to stay with me tonight on is that the condescending are coming forth of God he comes from the great eternal self-existing he begins to come downward because he knows we can't understand that how can you understand self-existing the only way you can understand understand self-existing is to become self-existing right I mean you know I don't understand how the uh TV works I don't understand how telephones work that I can call you know India right now and talk to a person I don't understand that you say well that's all in them well all right that's your brain but there was a time none of that was capable of being understood I like to read in the little paper we get at home it gives what happened on this date you know back in time and uh you know it'll tell you that so-and-so was here that says Einstein uh got to Patton on this or Edison or whatever you know I like to read those things because I see then that that we have advanced greatly in our understanding but what would even um uh the great minds Einstein would he be able to comprehend the things that man is doing now is so far Advanced Beyond his day until now if he'd have studied with it and come up with it yeah but get my point all right so then let's see if we can watch God as he condescends down and bringing himself from one form to another form to another form as coming down and not be a different God you know how many in what little bit we've talked of in the first few Services how many gods would you have to have to to fulfill all of them but since the same God all right when we get to it in a minute where it looks like a child playing before the father's door just remember that's just a way of expressing it that's God in another form that's a way of explaining things to our human terminologies all right but as we watch the coming forth of God we can get an idea of how that we came forth amen because remember now that's what my point was it's got to be a full-grown man Adam with no baby and growed up you see man is still arguing over where God created eggs or created chickens you know he created male and female he made chickens he didn't make eggs but see we want to well you don't know no and you never will is yourself so just think about it now the way that God will come into being to be able to understand him you know comprehend him and he can reveal himself will be the same way that you and I come into being now if you don't get enough write that down and study over it think on it I'm trying to get us to look at if we can see how we come into being we can see how he come into being and we see how he come into being we see how we come in to be all right because it's not the Journey of you and I it is not you and I coming into being now preached to you long enough to ought to be able to comprehend that statement it's not you and I this is not the condescending of man this is the condescending of God to bring forth his offspring to bring his children into being right and his children are a part of him we've been through it and through it we're not something he created when you're talking about eternal life as the bride of Christ he didn't create us he just brought us into being right but the way we come has to come down through creations and birth and things in a new birth to be able to receive eternal life but think about it now to try to follow God in his condescending we can get an understanding of how we we came into being all right then we'd be able to look backward and see you know how it is all right we don't believe in many gods we believe in one true and living God all right we believe God has many manifestations father son Holy Ghost he has many attributes about him healer deliverer savior but it's the same person amen amen see that's where your your organizational things is no it's got to be God in three persons Blessed Trinity that's not even in the Bible but yeah that's what man has been taught and they'll kill you for believing the truth you say oh no they won't well they're doing it and they sure have done it all right now then in doing that then our main thought is to see God unveiling himself to be able to work you and I can comprehend him and he done it in a way that is so marvelous to reveal himself to mankind and in doing it then we know the word amorphy comes into view that is used by the prophet Allah it means change in form we read our in Colossians were that he was in the form the image form the not another God all right when we read about the child outside the father's door creating the world that's not a second person see we'll agree that he never sent a son to die for you and I he came himself right because we wouldn't do that all right we we follow that line and to think about it and see that doesn't make Oneness out of it then because you've got many forms that he reveals himself a Oneness is just like you know father son Holy Ghost whatever but they can't see that what I've tried to get you and I to see that the bride is the final in morphe amen for the Gentile dispensation now the Jews get nerves they're going to the white Throne you've got many forms for him to be displayed but in the Gentile dispensation where you and I are at you and I are that final form because God is not here in a Corporal body right he's in our bodies he has a body to live in that's inside of you and I he doesn't need a body on Earth at this time we meet that body in the air all right then thinking about that it's the same God all the time you hear the prophet of God's make a statement like this he said the same God that walked ashore to Galilee is right here tonight he's not talking about the flesh is he said the same God that created the world is standing right here tonight one because it's God in another form amen so you just changes his form because the word amorphy comes from the stage act to where one person can play many different parts but remember when it's all in finality it's just one person they might play a lot of different parts but it's the same person right right so when I get that in your mind about God and think about it because we're going to try to comprehend you know and I'm sure it won't get through tonight but follow the thought of God making himself known and he does that by his creation because the Bible says that even the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human being pastor of Church former General Motors employee what what else you want to put on that but how many people are they it's just one person so it could be understood by the things we see Robert said I can take a blade of Grace and preach for how many years did he say one time 20 years I think what he said preach off of a blade of Christ no see it's unveiling that God there is a message titled the unveiling of God we'll quote some out of that and then you've got the Mighty God unveiled because you see in the unviolent of God he carries it from God over into the bride but then when you get to the Mighty God unveiled he's dealing with the revealing of the Bride of Jesus Christ and he says in her then dwells the fullness or the godhead bodily and if you read about two verses down from where we read during Colossians that's what it says about this Christ because the Bible said in Christ dwelt the fullness all right so now follow the point as we try to read a little bit and just get the thought God had a hidden Mystery that he was going to reveal in this mystery is only to be revealed in this day after the opening of The Seven Seals all right to bring into view the complete Plan of Redemption so all right go ahead now brother these brothers had had these notes and we've juggled them like crazy man because uh we've added to and everything else but they've had these same notes and some of you didn't get a full notes tonight that try to read you just got a couple of additions because you're supposed to get what you had all right then that way you know you I wouldn't throw them away if you look down through there and see some it ain't finished I'd wait I might might try to finish boy it was number two brother Joe and her brother Anderson and the point I want you to see is is just what I've said to you now watch him who is this male chedded dick priest 1965-220 when the evening paragraph 40 and that's what God did it's the same God all the time God in the form of the father the spirit the pillar of fire the same God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in morphe brought out so he could be seen all right now and now that same God is the Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost not three gods three offices three acts of the one God all right so not nail that down in your thoughts now go on to the to a because these are some we had to add to this is all for the unveiling of God preaching 64 614 paragraph 77 and 78. and when he said there he emptied himself are poured out now we would think like this that he vomit up see that's what the English word would mean like pour out would mean like vomoc up you know come out something come out of you different from what you are huh that's the English word of emptied or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him but the word kinos in the Greek does not mean that he vomited up or some his arm went off his eye went out another person it doesn't mean that right see our English words would carry us to another person or another but kinos cares you to the point of not even an arm going out you know an eye going out or even another person it doesn't apply to it that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit but it was he himself you get it congregation says amen he himself poured himself into the people now that's bringing right on down to where we're at right Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to thank God pouring himself into the human being and to the believer pour out it was a part of his drama to do so God all the fullness all that God had bodily was in this person Jesus Christ it was God and God Alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person God failed in human flesh all right God condescending to Veil himself into human flesh okay as I said if we'll watch the way he comes down to human flesh we can follow the way we come down and I'm going to say this so write it down here in your thoughts we are not dealing tonight with just all man we're going to only deal with coming to Adam has everybody got that locked in your mind so don't go running it on over into we'll get to those things as we come to it we're only going to bring it down to Adam because Adam was given eternal life but you and I wasn't born with eternal life that's right all right but what we're going to see is how did that man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 how did he come into being and that's not all man go to all man was not created in the image of God okay so we come into the full grown man Adam is where we're going to now so don't try to push it on over we'll get to those things as we go along so let us think about it let's read a portion of a quote Wade read there uh Sunday evening so go ahead with 2B which is questions and answers on Genesis preaching 53 7 25 . you can come all the way down this is what Wade was dealing with Spirit man and all like that fishes and everything we'll get back to that on the other quote so that's fine this is the part I want you to think of he wasn't in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God Adam was the first physical human being right physical that's Genesis 2 when we get down to it all right the first creation was God himself now Theologian read that and his mind goes blank God created God that little wig and Remus healed and went to school you want to know better than that God created God that's not what he said see that's what your mind is saying because your mind is saying or starting a doing a being one creating another huh that's not what he's talking about in the condescending of God he comes forth in the understanding of Elohim that's the only words they can go back with because that word literally means self-existing so what else could a man with his human brain try to comprehend as the great Eternal God begins to condescend downward he said if I step over in other words listen to me here is a gap here's the Eternal God existing alone he says if I move downward toward that man that I'll eventually make I must first give him some understanding that he'll be able to comprehend me so it wasn't this God creating this God watch in a minute when we get to the fact the father sitting up here on the throne a son goes out in front and begins to say Let There Be not two gods well if you want to burn one down here well all right go ahead beat your brains out trying to figure it out because you will but yet when a prophet is saying the first creation was God himself the first part or understanding are comprehension of an eternal God would look like that he did create something because here's where that I differ with the people of this message you've seen those beautiful things where the brothers got these lights and he puts them up here a lot of you seen them and gloried about it until you heard a truth here's the he's got this and it comes up and he got a big old light and then he moves that over to here and then he moves that over to here and he moves that on over to here and everybody shouted have you seen that I did I did because that's not the way I believe God say we do have a separation online say we do have a self-existing I don't believe he would like the wind just floating around he's just a spirit he don't need anything the Bible says Heaven's my Throne personal footstool what else will you build me right I don't need your hours as he said I'm just going to do that so I can make myself known do you understand what I'm getting at it's something coming forth into an ability to put a word as something to understand because you see this is the way I believe it and you you think about the way that that brother draw them beautiful drawings of this Halo and all of this and put it over here and over here he didn't realize what he was doing I want to quote a quote to you that you hear it very very often of the prophet all God was he poured into Christ oh Christ he pours into the church and that's exactly right but what is your concept of that thought oh what do you mean but just all God was he went into Christ well then you ain't got no God you've done moved it all over here right I said where the man brought it then you said well all Christ in the church well then you ain't got no Christ left oh you got as a church you've just done away with Christ you've just done away with God and sister Gail it just leaves you I don't believe that I'm totally opposite to all of that thinking always have been I love the way the brother Mo explained it years ago when he was talking about the expanding of God he said you take an apple you cut it up you give out to pieces you run out of apple I don't believe it that way I believe the more that God gives away the greater he gets now you tell me any other way to believe in God than that so then all God was just change a form and make a Christ leave God is where he is well I thought we believed the Bible the Bible said that he asked the devil one day where have you been he said I've been going to and for on the Earth whoa what was he doing I've been going to and from the earth I've been out there deceiving the people who was he talking to the bride or Christ or God I like to make you think why because thinking in at least increases the brain and that way you won't have Alzheimer's he might get Old-Timers but not Alzheimer's more you exercise that brain the better it works don't worry about using it it's not like a car that after a while it just wires out you know do you understand what I'm saying God the great eternal did everything come down this way and leave nothing up there that's what we think I don't think that way I think everything is still there in another form move down here to be the Christ to create all things and then Christ is still here the Holy Ghost is still here the Christ the almighty God but yet that Christ come on to death Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost an end to every believer down Through the Ages by the new birth that increases God see you race out well ain't no more god well ain't the more Christ well ain't no you're right where the devil wants you the devil wants you to believe you are God is that the scripture he said I'll be like God but then in the last days he becomes God to the people all right you see why I love the godhead so much it's beautiful if you keep in the right order but if you don't you're just going to go Haywire trying to figure it all out so then all God was when he pours it into Christ doesn't do away with God and it don't you don't have to move it over into so that's what we want we we want to keep moving something why not just think it's the way God's doing things he's unveiling himself so the prophet said it's the same God all the time and then we read here that that man in the lower creation of God in other words when he began to physically create to the first creation was God himself that wasn't one person creating another person we just got through reading that there's no first person second person third person he is the person the only person right but that's a beautiful drawing my Lord what do you want a beautiful drawing what a man said to me one time when a guy he hit all these trumpets brought out now I said brother that ain't easy for all the way you got it drunk the man drawn it he said that's a beautiful drawing and then my Lord man what's the drawing you know that a picture is worth a thousand words and you know that they started the way they got the Trinity concept into people's mind you know how it was they made a drawing of Jesus and they put a halo over his head they made a drawing of a great God before then and then and then they wound up the Catholics did and they they made a Mary with a halo over her head and she's holding a little boy with a halo over his head see that started putting that into our minds it's got to be a trinity I've seen the picture what's the picture got to do about the word of God pictures are great things but if they're not according to the truth what good are they but listen what he says the first creation was God himself then out of God came to logos watch him which was the son of God this is back before this is the coming down to the creation of and nothing is existing there at that time come on so then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word now watch him in the beginning was the word and the words with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us out of the logos came forth the the man now out of the logos and he said the logos is the son of God so I ask you the question I did 30 years ago and hurt some people's feelings I'm sorry but it made you think it's okay I asked Dan I said when you say son of God what do you think of they said 2 000 years ago I said even the theologians got a better Revelation than that go to Rich Schofield you guys go feel Bibles read to Genesis accountants go feel and once you're talking about the logos the theophany the son of God no it's not we done been through that message right we don't believe in eternal sonship we believe that g Ives Jesus Christ was God made manifest in another form called the son of God and as I always say then Nebuchadnezzar looks down he sees for those three in and supposed to be killed he sees four the next day he said we throw it in three now there's four and he said the other one must have he's in the form of the son of God he knew that whoever was in there would have to be God and he knew if he could see it he'd have to be called a son because it's no other terminologies it wouldn't vipers and ideas and talks all right so then God was his first creation he stepped from where that he could not be comprehended he started condescending and he stepped down in a condescending that's the only words I can use and it does then the the spiritual eye of understanding can begin to pick up that whatever is fixing to happen is the same God that's going to do it that's why it doesn't say Jesus created all time read John 1 Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 in James 3 and 9 or whatever all things were created by Jesus Christ he's the only Creator that's where you theologians they can't follow that they just go Haywire why because they got two or three people well they got a father over here and a son over here Holy Ghost over here now if you just believe it's the same one true and living God he just stepped down and he just begins to keep stepping down to where we can understand him now your kids you love Grandma and Grandpa don't you you love Mom and Daddy you love Grandma and Grandpa extra stepping down lower but those things about Mom and Daddy you don't understand when you're a little kid right you don't understand when Daddy says but I'm going to whip you because you certainly don't like none of the terms but when you get on up a little older and you look back you say well I wish Daddy would have whooped me three or four more times I might not have got into the trouble I did see it's the condescending understanding we're talking about now so the first was God himself then out of God how could you say it any other way what how beautiful it is but how could you say it any other way and out of God came to logos which was the son of God that's what he just said no it's not God the son that's God in another form called logos we'll get to it in a minute theophany Spirit Holy Spirit God unveiling himself and see out of the I know God came to the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word now you got word logos Son of God already covered in one piece of a sentence he goes to John 1 in the beginning was the word and words with God and the Word was God now that word with in John 1. I showed you theologians Haywire because the word with seems to signify two people right but now we've just got let's see we've just got God himself logos Son of God word is all referring to the same person see we want to use terminologies and we say well the word with means with somebody well when you get over to Genesis 1 26 you really do go eight-wire God has said let us make man one of these days ago you think this is a crazy statement but one of these days I'm going to do a series on the godhead he said you've been preached it 40 years that's right just now getting enough knowledge to preach on it because you see I don't have any problem with looking and seeing God and seeing Christ and logos and seeing bride I don't have any trouble right I just now beginning to understand look what he goes on to number three now let's just read a little we just have to go so far and then we'll quit remember what we're doing tonight you run it back up to where you was and you'll write down below the first creation no right here is where this one stop right there paragraph 21 go down yeah take on 21. 21 is between there but that's that's paragraph 21. all right oh I got a beautiful picture this is taken from questions and answers on Genesis 53 729 paragraph 23. all right see right in here would be your questions and answers right all right well I got a beautiful picture in my mind now if you could take a little trip with me I believe I've talked on it before but to get this place to work get to the place where you'll be sure to see it and let's take a little trip and go back for a little while and don't think about it how hot it is let's get our minds right on what we're going to talk about and think now let's go back a hundred million years before there was a star moon or anything in the world now there was a time when there wasn't nothing here it was just all forever in eternity and all of every eternity with God he was there in the beginning now think about it a beautiful picture to look at things all right go on to number four who is God priest in 1958 18. this will be two to read 16 17. all right so he first was god Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father not another God not another person the same God in another form that was what was that was that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos part of God that went out of God a part of God that went out of God it went on down to e17. and in the direc this is just like a child playing before the door it was the Son of God the Lord gosh and I can see him out there and he's fake and said let there be light and there was nothing but there was something happened and an atom turned there and began to whirl around this way the sun began to come into existence because he said let there be there's the author Authority excuse me where where did he make it from I don't know there was nothing to make it from him but he believed his own word I love that he believed his own word and there was light I could see a peace flaw for that it's a media meteor after a few million years or 100 billions of years if you want to call it and it circled away out I see him standing out there watching him he falls down in here he stops it after it falls a few million years and let it hang there in orbit and here goes another one flying off the Sun and goes over here and hangs down and stops dar what's he doing he's creating the world and the things this word is logos this son of God I thought we believed by the new birth that we were The Offspring of God I thought we were believed we were the children of God I thought we believed we were Sons and Daughters of God now wait just a minute now you're getting too close because you're putting us back there I'm glad you thought of that if you haven't listened I'd advise you go back about four services and come back this way that Eternal logos Son of God was God in another form it was a bride back there with him if you wasn't there if I wasn't there when you created the world we'll never be there simple enough because that's the only way to have eternal life that's what I said watching him come down we see us come down we just got to make sure we get it right and make us come lost and got to be saved everybody else wants to bring us saved and don't need no Redeemer I don't agree with that man look at number five that he goes to a message on the cruelty of sin and the penalty of what it costs to read sin out of our Lives I think 53 403 paragraph 48 will go through 51. and or two okay then he said after he had got all of that made before he'd ever done anything else I can see this little Halo move over over this world which was merely a cinder Frozen hanging out there like a great Iceberg now the message before see it's the way I try to put them together to make it we were talking about that light and the creation now he's telling you what it looks like bring another message and just take what it looks like and I could see this little Halo move over in this world which was merely a cluster a cinder Frozen excuse me hanging out there like a great Iceberg and he moved it over near the Sun and he began to turn it like that around the Sun it began to melt and the big ice glaciers tore loose Texas was being formed you don't know how this United States got all these mountains and valleys and Grand Canyons and things like that they I never was convinced that the Grand Canyon which is five miles deep got that wave called water running down through there if you do that's all right I believe right here is where it happened Texas was being formed me and the planes there as we're talking now the icebergs come down through there breast chronology just configure out and then the whole world after it run down into the Gulf of Mexico and so forth begin to beam up with water in the world without form and void and we're in Genesis 1. see now then God moved and separated the firmness from the waters and he made Delights and then he created all the creation then after he made it all the trees come up the plants and so forth what a beautiful setup he had he loved it it was beautiful and he thought that was fine watch so we couldn't just leave it in that state he had to leave something with it so he said let us plural make man plural in our own image let us make man in our own image and soon so when God made his first man he was a spirit man he was something on the order of God or the Son of God now that's not Adam and flesh we'll get to it a little bit adamant flesh is like an animal like a dog cat in a bar this is a special creation he was something on the order of God or the Son of God the logos that was the first man yeah he has no trouble here bringing a man and speaking of a man and him being in the image of God we shouldn't have any trouble with it but we should get it right Spirit man logos Son of God first man first man was not a physical creation First Man was created before the world the flesh Man was created in Genesis 1 25 4 25. on the sixth day Man was created on the sixth day right he said well wait a minute is Genesis 2 4 it's great it wasn't Genesis 2 when he's created it's Genesis 2 that records his creation come on Spirit man comes first then the physical man comes in Genesis 125 or whatever it is the sixth day God never created anything after the sixth day okay he rested the servant I thought we believe the scripture so then the physical man comes in Genesis 1 24 25 right in there a spiritual man was already before the world began he said well this is just in the mind of God I'd go back about four services and start listening we've done back there and found out that eternal life you have wouldn't just in the mind of God that eternal life you have today by the new birth was a part of God when he was self-existing he's laying down a few things one of these days I want to start preaching I gotta slow down watch what happened with this man this son of God this logos this Spirit man that was the first man and he gave the man jurisdiction over to lead all the animals life just like the Holy Spirit leads the Believers today go here do this now if we were perfect in submission to the Holy Spirit God would lead us by the Holy Spirit just like Adam led the animals Adam had control of the animals physically once he got created but how come he had it why did he have control of the animals because that logos theophany Son of God already had control of the animals before he was put in physical contact I'll just say if you want me to if it not have been this first man created spiritual then the lines would have ate the second man immediately I don't know what I said silly okay that's silly so then he made them then when he began to move he began to move upon upon the idea then that it made Man Out of the Dust of the Earth there was no man until the soul no one to do work no physical being so he made Man Out of the Dust of the Earth right he made two men in Genesis spiritual man then physical man now just think well let's go down and just read this part says the man came from a different life and and we say then when we look at her man here he's in the image of God and watch this is was not the image of God to begin with this is not it this was the image of animal life evolutionists arguing he said I don't believe in the chain of evolution the way they do all come in a single cell but I believe we he evoluted certainly he's not talking about Evolution the evolution of one band from another but then when God made all of that and got put the man in the made him out of the Dust of the Earth and what did he do made him out of the Dust of the Earth and not in his own image that's physical right he'd already made the man spiritual image then he breathed into him the Breath of Life and he became a living soul the soul of man is the nature of the spirit and when you're reborn you don't get a new spirit you get a new nature of that spirit it's the same spirit with a new nature of it all right now if I go any further I've got to go into some thoughts so what I want to do for just a moment I want to stop and then we'll come back to here Sunday but I want you to think about what has been said God was made first not made he changed his form that could be comprehended are you following me when he said first creation was God himself that doesn't mean that there was a time he didn't exist and then he did I've preached to you what 40 years and all the attributes of God was in God before he ever started anything he didn't develop attributes coming this way they were already in him where'd he get him from he didn't but as I was illustrating from a line to where you can comprehend nothing and all at once something happens and you begin to get an idea these movie versions today are beautiful I mean in doing things because they can take something that and and take a picture of something and they could make me standing right here in front of the pulpit and that could make me just totally disappear you know trick photographies Etc and then they could bring me into being gradually gradually coming into being and in all at once you say well hey that's that's brother Dale standing in front of the pulpit why because your understanding has been opened that's what I'm trying to get you to see God began to take the veil off the of himself to where he could make himself known the first creation was God himself next was logos Son of God and he begins to create who begins to create the Christ the logos the Son of God then John 1 1 is right that he's the Creator about verse three Colossians is right that we read Hebrews is right God in 200 times the government needs goes right on down to the and then I believe it's James 3 and 9 where it said all things were created by Jesus Christ he brought himself downward and as he did the wording then comes like it said about Nebuchadnezzar could look down there and see I know that if I can see it it's got a form and if it's in there and it killed them guys that put them in there why did it not burn him out of the tree he said there's got to be the son of God see then that way you're looking at God unveiling himself to bring himself into being that could be comprehended and then we look back and see him because I said if I go any further I'm going into Jesus and the soul and think right around said it was the soul of God that went to hell to pay the price for me and you he said his soul his Spirit his theophany of his being went to hell physical body didn't go to hell but to God that was in that body went to hell the one that began to drop downward it's not another God it's just God changing his form he's walking downward until he comes to Genesis every time you get to Genesis you've already got theophany word logos spirit Son of God before you even start the physical creation you've already got him unveiling himself in many forms to make himself known but if we can see that then we can watch and see how Adam came in to be because Adam was called a son of God see then as I said we're not talking about physical natural man you're talking about Spirit man logos theophany I don't want to make a couple of quotes to you before we close and let you think about it I told you there of Genesis 1 28. that we don't read a lot but this spiritual man that was put over the garden to lead the animals he was male and female and it was called them right let them have dominion over the fish of the I told you then you come on over later now you get on over about three or four and you pick up where they were told to multiply and replenish the Earth but you see Adam when he was in a spiritual being was told to multiply and replenish and brother Gary let's just put it out here this way everything that was needed to bring forth the rest of the creation of God was in Adam and Eve in their spiritual creation I'm not talking about physical doings right now come on it's like I told some of them the other day evidently God knew what was going to take place in the garden on that message that he knew we'd fall I made the point Adam and Eve had all the parts to bring forth human beings he must have known they were going to fall and then to be used because he knew they wasn't going to bring forth without the fall he didn't have to create Adam and Eve parts for them to multiply but I want you to look at this scripture wrote a randomized reading it the other day and I was reading I thought he said we read 126-27 but said let's read one let's read 128. told a multiply and replenish the Earth the word replenish doesn't mean this plenty twice it's been finished and replenished that's not what it's talking about it's to bring forth into being and you've got to admit had there been no fall Adam and Eve would have been instrumental in bringing forth I'm not talking about a body to live in now I'm talking about the spiritual creation you see we want to make a such a narrow thing or make her a big old hamburger and us me and a big old porterhouse steak you see why I'm against all of that stuff I know who calls to fall but I know Adam lost the whole human race because the Bible says in Adam all die he had a choice as Wade was bringing out he had a choice and he took his choice and brought to fall we want to lay everything under the woman try to blame her thinking we can skip our way into Heavens by some of our Beauties or something you know with people no no you try to blame for somebody else for what your problem are you know who your problem is you me me you we are a problem it's not somebody else but just think a second they were told in a spiritual creation to multiply and replenish now may I quote brother Branham how are we supposed to come brother Branham he said the seed comes through the body you go with that one seed comes through the body we were to supposed to come by spiritual multiplication that is the only way we can come forth now is by spiritual multiplication whenever that see that's where you get you don't stay with me I said don't run off onto Natural Things yet we are still on the spiritual don't get concerned about what Adam and Eve should have done or would have done had it done could have done or what have done they done what they've done there's no argument to the point and it would not have been that we would have come forth without the fall there's no argument to the point but the point is if we take it correctly preacher standing in the Pulpit breaking the word of God down to the people a spiritual multiplication you sisters talking to your neighbors Brothers and you talking to them because you're part of the body of Christ you talking to your neighbor you talking to the people that's spiritual multiplication have we forgotten the whole thing that was in our spiritual creation brother random said and we'll bring us out Sunday that Eve was in Adam in theophany okay you see I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption to us amen you say well you've got to share a funny way of doing it I agree but we've got to realize we lost poor can be saved if we come to the realization that we're lost and now I'm going to say this and you can just think what you want to and if somebody don't stir or understanding of some way to make us to begin to pray and searched God then the biggest portion of people are not going to get it would you agree see that's all I'm trying to do stir you up to get you to pray and read your Bible and read the prophet's message and listen to the tapes sometimes and in doing that I've become an intellect a smart alec know it all all kind of things have been tacked on people don't want to hear me but you know what I can't have that I don't have any problems with it my problem's just sitting right here with them facing is me and you is the ones I'm trying to get converted I'm not responsible for the rest of the world anything on the internet out there is on their own choices it's not for me but do you see what I'm talking about the title we use the title the two services the beginning of the Christian God now tonight and one more at least will be the beginning of the creation of God and of man because the same way God comes is the same way the man's coming so if you can get it either way if you can get the way that I'm talking about it that's the way I got saved you can say well that's the way God comes back on these things come on brothers about 10 minutes till nine we'll quit Brothers still got a lot of quotes on Sunday but listen Church I'm just trying to get you and I to see Who We Are how we got to be Who We Are and where we're headed but I pray that the things that I've said has not been something to hurt people's feelings because it's like what I said about the man that had the beautiful drawings maybe I shouldn't have said that but I just seen so many people I sat with a man and just he told us it just get that drawing and look at the way and I thought oh God just walk away I told God if I open my mouth I'm going to say something but it's helped me to be quiet and walk away because if you take all that and put it over here you've got nothing up there you take all that and put it here you got nothing there you've only got the bride of Christ and that's Satan's Doctrine is to get to people to believe that they are God because you see Church there'll never be a time but you and I won't be able to see who he is we get over there on the other side I believe we'll see the physical Corporal Eternal Lord Jesus Christ you don't want to make the body standing there amen and I believe we'll comprehend but you know it won't do away with this or do away with that or well the father's not here so we raise him out you know and we we don't need the Holy Ghost no more we race that out you get there you'll realize their stands father son Holy Ghost right in front of me let's stand 201 anybody have a need in his hands to sing I'd rather wear my voice understand see if that God still lives we'll see if that God has condescended in your revelation only the bride is predestinated to say the truth in the end time only the bride is predestinated to see somebody gonna bring it that we can see it then he's got the whole singing unto him and think about it and Richard both have been real sick vomiting diarrhea this gets down to where you anything you eat go straight through you the lady

bodies to build up their immune system it all would be well we love you in Jesus name anybody else last year if you remember they had a real bad problem with the flu bugs and all head over there at Banks County school and and it was telling us today that yesterday I believe it was today they had more kids absent today from sickness than they had had in any other day last year with all of that sickness see it's just Satan's doing everything he can and I believe in a Healer I believe in a deliverer brother John Martin I remember him saying it one time he said why do we wait till we get sick to pray he said why don't we pray before we get sick you know won't you thank him every day for your health I mean thank you for your your health you said when he I I I'm hurt you don't understand that's what's the problem you're trying to deal on some form of a line to do mediators or something believe it and say buy Stripes I'm Healed what does it matter to me how sick I get what has that got to do with it he's the Healer he's a deliverer we try to believe it release our faith you know what every day we get older every day we get new pains well that old devil won't after me he's after everybody in the world it ain't just you he's after it's everybody we're living under a curse folks whether you like it or not but that don't mean I lay down so anybody knows that's been in this church for 10 years you know this man don't lay down I don't give up I fight physically or whatever in my body to try to keep it under control I refuse to let the devil put those thoughts in my mind I say buy Stripes I'm Healed how are you doing call me up how you doing doing wonderful because you're sick little painted baby get off of that start confessing it you get an arm come on you people

we're the bride why don't we see more miracles Among Us you want to stay all night the prophet of God said that bride would be tried but everything in the book but she would stand and refuse to give in to Satan thank God for the trials and the troubles because by that we become what we're supposed to be father Lord we just we're just human beings and we just need your help so much in our lives and things and people would think that I'm hateful and arrogant and all the Lord I'm just trying to tell us the truth that we need to depend upon you more and more for our sicknesses and our doings right Lord we don't have to do away we're not going to doctors because we let them do the best they can do but they're not the final Authority you are Lord help us then to be what you'd want us to be
