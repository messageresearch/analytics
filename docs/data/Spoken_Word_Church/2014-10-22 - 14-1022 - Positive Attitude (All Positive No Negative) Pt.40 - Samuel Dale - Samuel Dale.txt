Lord Jesus we thank you For Your Love Your Grace your guidance your understanding thank you for you the Lord we love you we just ask you now to come tonight and speak to our hearts that we may receive Lord from you what we have need of be with the different ones Lord that are not here and things remember their sicknesses and things among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we thank you just have your way and let your loving grace be with each one of us in Jesus name amen Hebrews 13 8 then we've got another one but we'll just quote it but remember we're speaking on positive attitude amen all right O positive no negative now that's what we're going to talk about tonight all right remember then which how the rule over you who has spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follower considering the end of their conversation now watch in a minute when we read the quote where the Prophet said if you're going to the church that don't believe Hebrews 13 they get away from it no that's his word so then that's that's the point said consider the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word but remember in and I know we won't get there tonight but remember in Malachi 3 6 he says for I am God and I change not all right I really enjoyed that song is there anything that would be too hard for God to do nope you know why because I've already done it right I mean come on Amen you're already done it's not he's going to do it it's already done all right then that settles the whole situation now but I've been thinking on this scripture for quite a while in the series parts that have been about the positive attitude and remember our statements that we make with that one each service that anyone in the Bible that ever amounted to anything was someone with a positive attitude all right not only did they have the positive attitude about or you know or natural parts or something they had the positive attitude about uh God's word and God spoke to them and that made it positive all right now see then that that should be the point if we believe God has spoken unto us then right you know right what would be the problem like I was saying there the other day see David had no trouble with Goliath and he was ready to take on his brothers or the whole Army if it's necessary because he believed he was already anointed to be king well you know what it didn't matter what they'd done to him he was going to come to be king if he believed the prophet had anointed him for that all right so we've had a lot that we talked about Sunday there on the point of the promises that God had made unto us right you know the promises well now if he's made a promise is he going to fail to keep it I don't know where Richard's at maybe he's back there doing something with him but we need at least a little hour this is the hard time of the year to try to you know there he is looking all over the place trying to find him but we need him and please somebody still somebody still is playing with the air conditioner system now you may think it's smart and nice and happy and doing yours but the whole the system ran all last week all right so you want to put in about 20 bucks in the offering plate because that's what it done it ran all week long on what it was doing but see you know don't don't do that that's uh I know you think it's smart and you know and you're trying to be cool but go tell the ones that knows how to run it to be cooler or do something but anyhow all right but see the entire Bible to me is the promises of God that he has given and written down for the his bride now others are included and others get benefits Etc but he is the main thing is he's talking about and wrote the letter to his bride all right so all of the promises belong to her and he said all of his promises were what II Corinthians 1 20 they're yea and amen all right so then we should not have to worry about anything in it just think about it he's already done it it's already finished you know and we were talking up at the funeral home there when brother Mike had passed away and we were they were talking about and I thought about what brother Branham said he said if ever a doctor maybe you didn't say ever doctor maybe say 200 doctors or whatever he said we're standing with you and you're in the greatest Hospital of everything so it's your time to go you're going he said but if ever devil in hell is standing there with you and it ain't your time to go you ain't going so that's where we ought to realize who's in command you know of the whole situation and not worry about it then but now I want us to approach this and now the next message will pick up to relate to this of God not changing but what I want us to think about tonight is a finished product and that way we won't have to worry about whether it's there is you know whether we're talking about do it it's already finished all right now then there is no were in the Bible that there's any or what we would call negativism now there's a lot of things about what people and what they do in their situations yes but I'm talking about what God says has he ever failed to keep his promises has he ever failed to keep his word no no it don't make no difference see but yet we we look at it and I'll get to a quote in a minute what he's saying about it we look at it as you know believing it now do you realize that if you asked oh I wouldn't put a number on it probably 90 or better of the religious world today if they believed that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever they would say yes now but yet look at the way the world and the world system goes does it produce that as we'll read about brother random we've read this one over and over but to keep it before you that that's where Eve failed well now what did he fail on she believed in God I spread around them right she didn't doubt God she doubted his word all right now see then that away the religious World believes in God talks about God you want to go over here to this church and ask them do they believe in God you want to go anywhere in the world to a religious Christian so-called system to whatever it would be Catholics or whatever and they would you know you could say Do you believe Hebrews 13 8. and they'd say yes because it's in the word of God but has that ever been revealed to you sir I believe dires were the connecting link to all of things that will go out into what we talk about the uh resurrection that we've been talking about the change of the body and then the then the going home you know the Rapture to be caught away I believe it all hinges on the bases of Hebrews 13 8. all right but it hinges on that in the point of what God is saying not what we say we can call it all day brother around said you can say Jesus Jesus and be worshiping the devil now that's hard isn't it because you don't know what he is you don't know how to worship Him all right now then think about it we should always speak positive not negative according to the word of God now I want you to listen tonight I want you to listen and pray about what I'm trying to say do you know that when you say as we were bringing out Sunday a little bit about it you know and you say to people now let's check the Hebrews 13 8 and see if it works this way you say uh by Stripes I'm Healed well I now I just can't say that cause I'm still sick well now you are God one just lied and I'm pretty sure you know who I'm talking about all right well see you say but I've got to tell the truth you know that probably about 98 of the people in prison are been you know executed and things was there because of the truth right but now that truth may be a perverted truth the wording that we use that we call it truth if that's not according to what God says now let's put it this way you can say I told the truth about a car wreck that I saw you know I saw it right now what you're telling is right but you're not telling all of the circumstances that it involved you know with that wreck that you saw what so you say I'm telling the truth well it might not all be exactly the truth well I what do you mean I saw the car run into the other car if it didn't see you turn on say well I saw the car I saw this car number one run into car number two see then you're going to automatically say that the problem is car number one it might not be car number two might have pulled out in front of car number one do you understand you see how simple it is we can say the truth but yet it not be exactly right all right what about the way God says it you know that God says we're perfect and he's talking about born-again Christians right we're not talking about all the other junk right he says we're perfect well I guess you could say that now that's not all truth that you're doing right right you're lying but that's so close to the truth right but you're lying one because the Bible says that you're healed I thought we were supposed to say what the word said whether I understand it or not even whether I believe it or not you know let me at least say what it says all right because you see there's no negative in God see we may be saying something you know we used to believe in a Trinity right and you know that we'd argue with you all day long with scriptures that there was three gods well you know we had part truth right because the scripture you're reading is right but your self-interpretation upon that made it a lie never came from Heaven the prophet said it came out of the pits of hell right all right but yet we believe it I'll die for what I believe well is it true see to say I hope is a good way of doing things I hope now that hope can be a very positive point but if it's not all positive then what is it there's no such thing as 98 positive right right he says 98 pounds that's pretty good point no there's no such thing as 98 positive because you've already admitted this two percent negative all right so now you've made the whole 100 percent negative right oh you might turn on you may have cooked up a light you may do things and wire up and it'll turn on but you may not be getting the right amount of current will you say I've got the light on which you might not have the full current that you need you know that in electricity they'll argue with you that you can take a hundred well a 300 foot extension cord and put light bulbs on it and if there's just as much power on the end of that 300 foot as there is where it starts right is that the theory of electricity Aaron he'll tell you there's just as much power or whatever you want to call it you know at the end of that as there is where you start but I I want you to do me a little just tie a light blue about every 10 feet and then turn it on if it's true there's just as much there as he is here that light out dire should be as bright as this light but it won't work is dimmer dimmer dimmer dimmer dimmer dimmer okay oh we're telling the truth a meter May read but it doesn't make no difference now I'm trying to make a point about truth see we say I hope God doesn't say I hope show me in the Bible where God ever said I hope that's what terminology or word of a human language that has no Heavenly atmosphere to it God never says I hope he said I am right he said I am he doesn't say I hope all right you say I believe would you know to God he doesn't believe now come on I know the quote so don't run me with me I know God believes his own words so don't go with it all right because you're going to go negative and you're in trouble all right so go ahead but get what I'm talking about God doesn't say I believe he says what is written truth it that that's finished all right he said it's already to him it's alive it's real to him there's no negative to God well now I'm brought it down got to be something well I know we go ahead and do all your philosophy that's what's the problem if you've got a negativism Hebrews 13 8 is not correct but you got to have a negative no no no no no no forget it there's no such thing as negative and positive in God it's all positive we are the negative if there's anything to it he never says I hope so maybe I will or I might do it he said it's already finished God in his ways then I'm trying to get a point late in your mind if Hebrews 13 8 is correct then he's the same yesterday today and forever then if he says I'm God and I changed not well he was a trinity and we changed it we it was one and we changed it to a tree yeah we did he didn't change the no Trinity are you listening how much negativism do we have that we really don't even know we have come on I'm asking each one of us a serious question how much negativism do we have when we really don't even know we have it and that's what frustrates people is when you expose their negativism and see when you do then they get all upset with you about it but there's nothing in God in no way that has any negative Point whatever he couldn't say he's yea and amen he said yay nay yay nay yay huh but when he said it's yea and amen that means it's positive now before you go too far and miss me in the message I want to make a little point you and I are very negative all right we live in a negative world no no brother that we live in no we live in a negative world it took them thousands of years to split the atom no but you know God split it way back before then and right but now I'm trying to get you to think yes what brother Dale I'm I'm positive you ever heard that saying you know are you positive I'm positive I think if there's any doubt you're not positive now positive and negative goes together to make a lot of things that's agreeable but remember positive and negative don't make negative the only thing you're dealing with positive and negative is a grounding effect to make it work into capacity you desire for it to work like a light bulb you can put 5 000 Watts on one of those light bulbs it won't do a thing won't blow it it won't mess it up now I know somewhere you might go to a burning point okay but but you put a ground on there and you'll find out in a hurry right I mean you're going to find out in a hurry you hook up a 220 and put a 110 light bulb on it all right you just connect up one of those 220. and leave the negative off and it won't worry about it anything it'll just sit there but you touch that ground it's going to blow that light bulb in a hurry and see that's what happens to our Revelation that we think we have we thought we had an understanding of God until this Prophet came to bring us the message we thought we had enough knowledge of a lot of things until the prophet came along and showed us the truth right now think about no negativism and look at a God that's fully positive well then we know where the problem is at it's in US all right may I illustrate it as the prophet said he said now God doesn't change and he sit down to the church age he said he's the same but he said now I I didn't say that man didn't change and he said I didn't say that the church didn't change he said I'm saying that God didn't change all right when I ordered all of this Doctrine come from come from a lot of problems but now whatever he was he still is and whatever he is is what he'll always be right that's Hebrews 13 8. amen right now there's the positive about God's word that it doesn't matter what man believes or what's going on God is always positive and always right but yet it shouldn't are you listening it takes a revelation for you and I to have any form of being positive right the only part I have about this message is what God's revealed to me same for you I've always tell you I wish I had in my heart revealed what's in my head running around so quote will kill you scriptures will kill you I saw a sign the other day on the church and it said you and I are yeah let me just say it you and I in our ways of being and doing are the most positive negative things it's ever been now that may not come out good to your thinking but what I'm saying is there was a time when we were positive about things right we believed in a trinity we believed in an eternal hell we believed in all these things and one day the truth straightened us out see now think about this as I read see he said a teacher doesn't quote that's more on it but that was what struck my eye a teacher don't quote it down you're always quoting and we call you a teacher well then you you know you're not listening to what I'm saying if all I can do is could you get it together you remember the man telling brother random said if it was a good Baptist you know it says when we get it all down to where we know whatever word means in the Greeks and the thing he said until then we can't believe it he said they would arguing it the time of the Lord Jesus about it see you say well what we need to do is get all the quotes and I remember years ago a brother made a statement he said what we need to do he said we need to and they just developing the computer hadn't got into the uh bringing it into the message that much but they were talking about it and he said what we need to do said we need to just take all the quotes put them in the computer and let the computer shoot out the answer and that's what we believe oh that uh what would you do when we get over the minute when brother Brown talks about the Corporal body and and then when he gets through talking about a Corporal body let's see what else is he called it he calls it a cardinal body he calls it a cardinal body I looked that up and tried to find out what Cardinal meant from the bird on down to see if it had any relationship that maybe he would have putting something there for us to think about and I couldn't find a thing maybe you can but my point is to put this message in a computer and bring it out would just bring out word for word in a lineup and if that worked perfectly without any of the quotes brother Branham says in the wording that he says and the things that he speaks sometimes even if you got all that right you know what you'd have a good book right right you have a good book but if God could reveal it to you look what you'd have then well I'll just keep what I've got all right because what he's revealed to me I that I can stand on amen and I don't worry about it you know if you're getting the point what I'm saying is revelation is positive Revelation is not negative all right you can say Well it goes from negative to positive well that's okay but remember if you use that wrong you've got a problem right if you say and I know brother random use that negative deposit here I know yeah but you can't go from negative to positive come on you're all sitting there looking at me now I'm wondering how can you go from negative to positive come on we got electricians back here we've got God works out you know thing would have got on him clickers and stuff yeah brother Daniel which you can't go see we know and we say we go from negative to positive and that's all right but there's no way to go from negative to positive how can you do that so the prophet says it's from partial realization to perfect realization okay now we got something so what if you shot that into a computer to try to get an answer but do you realize the very positive the very negative part you start with do you want to use that word the partial realization that you would receive you realize that's positive I don't understand that because you're blowing my brain well uh you need to get your syringe kind of push a little in there you know spiritually speaking is what I mean because there's no way from a negative to a positive they argued that years ago I said well what are you arguing about right around them and simply saying partial realization to perfect realization right he's using partial realization as negative but he's not saying that it's negative anything God reveals to you is positive don't care how small it is that's why you shouldn't honor and be happy and rejoice when the god of Glory would drop down into a human being and reveal to that human being something about himself that ought to make us positive could you see you can't have him the same yesterday today and forever if you start trying to deal with negative and positive sometimes but even remember this God never changed he never became a trinity because we believed he was a trinity and the best we could try to explain that you know never made him any of that form whatsoever that we had in our mind now watch it I know ain't getting there this evening but that's all right watch it when the brother Brown says that he's the same here as he was tired all right that's the problem that I've had with the people of the message my problem has been one thing I've tried to be positive and people saying but we don't have nothing if you had what you think of God then this would happen and that would happen well come on let's talk about it sister freda's come walking up Sunday and said brother Dale while you're preaching my pain went away well that's what it's supposed to be right he sent his word and healed him but you see we say but but I don't see no I don't see no Silver and Gold Have I None but rise up and walk but you realize if he does anything he's the Healer and if he does never heal anybody up he's still the Healer if he never saves nobody he's still the savior you know what I mean from now on or do anything but you see that's what I've tried to get people to talk about and I know it's been a discussion among many that we just don't see the signs and wonders we used to see I differed with that then and I differ with it now because I've always tried to explain to you one thing that all other signs and wonders would never be in Lula Georgia they were around the world in The Bride of Jesus Christ but put it all together and what have you got Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever you remember this one we won't get to it tonight but remember this one well now in a way brother Branham says no right he's either the same or he's not the same but yet we think so see we think we're so smart in the point of being able to say well I just don't see things like you know we don't see like the ministry of brother Branham no not one person you never see that wrong person I've been that way ever since I've been in this message there is no such thing as one man having a Ministry like that it was Dire there was one man back there in the Bible which was the Lord Jesus Christ he had that Ministry and there's never been a man down through time that had that like he did right yet you had great men like Paul you had great men like you know Martin you know miracle in every meeting they had but yet in the last days when brother Branham come on the Earth he said here it is again he said God doing more in one service than he's done in the whole book of Acts you see that's where we get that big idea and I've been playing but yet explained to you you take the book of Acts I wish somebody would do it one day and sit down and go chapter one chapter two chapter and write down the Miracles and write down how long it was between here and here because you're somewhere into 30 years in the book of Acts 20 if you want to be technical using Brother random as a 53 to go with a Soviet house somewhere around 20 years or better see the reason I do that is I don't want those smart attic minds are doing but you know they're not doing no good with what I'm talking about I just try my best to dig you out of the holes that you're falling yourself into you sit there in the negativism and think about well there's nothing going on unless it happened to me now you let it happen you you're gonna get up and croak when I'm going to croak when it's happening to anybody why because it's Hebrews 13 8. all right the original translation says it's an emphatic dog lot Jesus anointed yesterday and today dividing with two words the same and for this ages the ages don't know how far it goes doesn't matter at first come it doesn't matter he's the same right that's the original translation all right you could go and do a lot of the different ones and they've got some marvelous ones if you'd like to take my book one of these days and look them up but think about it listen to what he says we'll get a few of these look at number one on our notes which I've read this over and over and over this is proving his word we got Josiah in in Zach back there running and I told him I said scan the audience as we go along oh them frowny old faces is on that computer I don't like that Lord I put my face on there why are you a crook you don't want your identification somewhere look what he says if you belong this is from the message proving his word 64 8 16. and reason I say that we had a meeting we would hear one time you remember that happened a little Ray tell you the man's name I won't get into none of that we had a man come here Among Us in a fellowship meeting was having come find out he was the Feller that would help in that guy down here trying to push his wife out to her pushing a woman out of an airplane down in the okra for gnocchi swamps and they couldn't get her to fall out and they come back and landed to try to get her greased up a little more and they caught them he said right here he used to go to brother Ray's house you know a lot of people so he might be some people might not want their face okay he says if you belong to a church that don't believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever the same in every way get away from it get away from it now let me put this part in where you'll think about it that's why I read verse 7. because in verse 7 it says consider the end of their conversation right is that verse seven we only read verse eight pull it back up brother Joe you want to pull up Hebrews 13 8. and just look at it remember then which have the rule over you who's that talking about preachers right Elders deacons people Sunday school teachers all kind remember them which either rule over you who has spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith father considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all right if somebody's not speaking according to Hebrews 13 8 we're supposed to get away from it look at the next one we'll get a few things and then we'll see what we're doing look at the God of this evil age this is the one we use a lot of times About Eve we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan and you and I are going to prove to Satan now who do you think keeps us talk about we're reading it all for the thing I want to believe I'm one of them don't you know we find this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve that she's not that type of a woman oh man that's just oh that's rather adulteration and all other things you know and that was just he was just all kind of adulterous and you know amazing thing to me in the Bible there were the brother random was speaking about that it wasn't Mary Magdalene that they cast those seven demons out and you know I had my idea and I bet you did too you had your idea about them demons didn't you lust desire fleshly things I'll be glad to show you where the Prophet said that that wasn't what it was it was Pride boast you know I'm something you mean but I thought that was a a lust demon the lust Demon's probably better off look she's not like Eve that type of a woman and she'll be Tried by his word I love that God give me a word whether I understand it or what let me have it I used to go to Jeffersonville years ago and I've always been a shyster about the words you know that we'd go to Jeffersonville we'd go up there that was in the 68 right in there and they'd print 500 books and they'd beat 2 000 people there stand in line I stood in line for three hours to get into listen to a tape get over that cut page two uh but you know what when they come to give those books out they'd be coming from the front to the back they bring boxes and the ones that are there you remember it they bring boxes and they'd set them down and they take them out and they pass them down the aisles but we'd probably be sitting in the very back because of hard to get a seat I would just go down through there like I was looking for a seat and they'd pick up a handful of books and I'd say thank you brother like I was going to help him I was on the back row we always got the books we never went to Jeffersonville that we didn't get the book of the what they were playing I made sure that's why I love that word well look what he says about her Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise now remember she never doubted God she never doubted there was a god right come on all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called by his name of course is his bride she used to come into contact Again by the same thing face to face with Satan face to face with him not by just denominational truth or something whatever word we're going to face every word every word that proceedeth out of his mouth brother Joe go over to number seven and we'll try to get this and back up and talk a little bit well he's getting there I'll give you the background of the story he's talking about our fine denominations such as Presbyterian Methodist Baptist Church of God Pentecostals whatever Nazarene Pilgrim holist I'd say to them hello I'd say to them Christ is the same yesterday today and forever sure you remember where I started a while ago you could ask anybody did they believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday sure sure well is he the same in every way except his Corporal body and brother Branham say what then they would answer well there'd be a question she would start to a point if you understand what he's doing then you'd say well he's he's everything except a Corporal body and you say to the people this message right now that here he's here the same except his Corporal body well I don't see no signs and wonders you don't even have that in the Baptist method it's they're right over right now screaming about signs and wonders come on well there'd be a question they would say yes of course but if Christ is the same he's got to be manifesting himself just like he did for he said the works that I do shall you also More Than This shall you do where I go to the father a little while in the world will see me no more now what's he saying could it be that Eve in the garden just misbelieved one word is that the way it is still not you remember no and she believed everything she was a good preacher she was a good church member she was really a great person remember this unbelief came into being before the actual literal act where the Beast took place so now we're dealing with it prior to the Natural act so get the natural act out of your mind the real serpent seed is Satan's lie that's the seat of the serpent he says lie he doesn't have a natural seed right but you go to the people of the religious world and you ask them is he Hebrews 13 8. yes well do you believe that he heals today like he did no no I will tell you this much now I believe he can right now I believe he can but he just don't do it now what kind of a lie is that I consider that to be the greatest one ever told but he don't do today like he used to why don't you say as far as I'm concerned you might have a hope if you do that but if you determine it on the basis of your own rotten bushel of apples you might get in trouble you see at least we should say he's the same at least we could now should never say in a way that's on down in here right we should say he's the same we are the ones that's causing the problems now we got it in order but to say God don't do like he used to do you are a liar and the truth is not in you more words did I hit words today I preached a little series here one time in the seals message you never told nobody what I was doing through the seals I preached and I said Lord I'm not going to talk about healings or anything I'm on deliberately stay away from it I didn't mean I wouldn't pray for nobody I you know we had prior we had done but I ain't gonna tell nobody what I'm doing when it was all finished I said now I want to ask you a question how many here has been healed during this series which is I don't know 60 70 messages I don't know exactly brother gearing tell you sister Louise is going to say I tell you but you know what there was a lot of hands went up it had been healed delivered but you see church that's where our problem is at do we think about manifested Sons and Daughters well in order to be to speak that word just speak that word I told them when I first heard that I said you've got to get it for you can speak it and what I meant by that was it had to be revealed to you not you speak it right you remember Sunday when I stand with the prophet that said the other day on that tape where he said it's not what you say he said it's not the words you say he says it's what's in your heart your thinking about the revelation it's your faith that God looks at not your beautiful words be like that man was in a Baptist Church that time got up there more he they had him to pray he prayed the most beautiful prayer you've ever heard in your life and this other man told me later he said I looked over there and said that Feller was reading it got a good life said he was reading it well that's all right he wanted to write it down and read it but listen Church how easy it is it to fall in the category where Eve failed have you ever put your plate except no no I'm not like that first type of woman she wasn't that type of woman to start with either I'm talking about back before the literal things begin to happen is where her spiritual condition was beginning to mess up and she doubted God to keep his word I would say well in a way you could have said to Eve do you believe Hebrews 13 8 of course we know it wasn't written back there all right but if you'd ask her do you believe God never changes she just said you're right so it wasn't God it changed it was easy to change you know what she changed the word what has mankind done down through time changed the word right to their own ideas and Concepts I remember when the two Soul Doctrine got started I think they're in the 60s and 70s and people would be talking they'd say I've been waiting on this I know something was coming I've been awaiting on this I believe just all it alone okay but what is he talking about this people that he would say Do you believe that he's the same and wrote around and said but if Christ is the same he's got to be manifesting himself just like he did for he said the works I do you shall works I do shall you also More Than This shall you do for I go to the father but you see I wish you would run in and I'll try to cover this and I won't have to back up because I got a few more minutes brother Branham said he's here the same except a Corporal body now I wish you'd run that into your computer I believe it's 148 times now some of those are not related I run a lot of them but some of them are not related to say Corporal he just said we're here in a Corporal body you know but I'd say 80 percent of them at least 60 percent of them are talking about that Jesus is the same here today except for a Corporal body in other words what's he saying the only difference between back there when he walked ashore to Galilee and today is the Corporal body and you know what he says we are that body if he came here now in a Corporal body he would mess up every scripture in the Bible because we're supposed to meet him in the air then it's supposed to be you know at that situation then we'll meet a Corporal body huh you see church that's where we get everything all the way and we don't think about what he's saying he's the same in every way except a Corporal body but do we believe that he said one day like this he said no one needs say I wish I was back there you remember that one he said because he's the same yesterday today and forever but we tell you I wish I'd back there when the Lord Jesus was here let me quote brother random I'd rather be here right right is that he said he had a choice of times he said he's going to be here would that be nice to have been back tire with Peter and Paul and those Apostles wouldn't it to a lot of us there's a few of you that are still on or on that part because you were there when the prophet came and was doing you might have been young kids like Joyce and in Charlotte and Brother Gary back there if I miss anybody else I didn't mean to but some you know that was Dire that was that's an honor a great cherished possession I'm proud to go around people and they say have you got any people in your church that was in them prophets Ministry you know I said when I started there in July the 4th 1971 when brother Moulton I started the church together I said the biggest portion of people in that building was people that said under bread around this ministry and seen the dead Rays the sick healed there's Tootsie in in Frida they was there dear and brother Reynolds Ministry but you see I'd rather be here it would have been nice to have been back there with brother Branham to went hunting and fishing with him because that would have been a wonderful time but I'd rather be here even though I know as we read that this bride is going to be tested by every word Satan's gonna pour everything he's got against this little bride try to make her doubt and if he can make us doubt he's got us but at least we should say I might not be able is this a quote I might not be able to produce everything is that the way brother run said it he said but don't let me stand in the way if somebody can that's his quote you see I believe he's the same I can't take anything negative yeah but we just don't see it nobody's tying you to this building to make you come to this church I don't mean that in disrespect or nothing I just lean into the truth ain't nobody gonna say you're off the word to leave but there's one thing about it if you find more in what's here please let us know because I might like to try to follow around with you because I'm interested in one thing I've always been to that one part you know yourself that I've never been negative on anything like that I've always been very positive in the worst Downs that I've ever been I've never been negative about God's word God is the same I might not be able to bring him on the scene but you know what there's somebody around the world have you ever noticed brother Branham we want to quote one-sided a lot of time you ever noticed that he speaks about Billy Graham and going overseas and being challenged you know and naturally he's first is speaking of himself because he said he should have called to America but he said somebody look that up and see if he don't say somebody not just him somebody could have come to the aid what are we going to do Church when everything is gone out from under us and there's no no doings on anything oh you're a Doomsday go right ahead don't worry about it I used to have enough food in my house to feed this church for almost a year he got to getting rotten and we had to get rid of a lot of it set up a good old Pig and hate him it's true I still say you ought to have a little food now I still say you ought to have a little dire because you know you can't depend on the grocery store I mean one rush to the grocery store and that's ended it'd be good if you sit back a couple of cans of pinto beans over in the corner of the cabinet at least you'd have something to eat I don't look for doomsday because I know that whatever takes place if he's the same now here's where we're going to end it before you think about it or not down in that Dark Ages when those people were dying being fed to lines being killed and slaughtered and 68 million of their own records read Fox's book of martyr sometime but you know what sure look gloomy in that day didn't it it looked like the man said what said how could God set up in heaven and fold his arms and allow his church to do that he said the man just don't know the word do you realize that when they were killing all of those Christians he was Hebrews 13 8. we just don't look at it right Peter come along and he said I'm not worthy to be hung like my master he said turn me upside down right that just turned me upside down but yet the man had opened the doors lost his life but you know what Hebrews 13 8 was there to take him off the cross right even a thief hanging on a tree beside of our master they said Lord remember me Hebrews 13 8 was there see we look at it like as long as he comes on the scene and doing what we ask oh yes he's Hebrews 13 8. but around him says a no from God is a better than all of our yeses something to that degree what about it but yet we think well nothing's going on the greatest thing that has ever been in the world is now taking place for you and I to be Tried by the word is the greatest opportunity we could ever have may cause some of our Lives what do we word who's concerned right Hebrews 13 8. in the worst case you could think of of any Christian or any happening and yet he's the same yesterday today and forever that church had to die and go into the ground somebody here has talked like that and wonder what about the nuts that church had to die and go into the ground unless the corner of wheat died to divide alone that early church had to die and go on the ground for you and I to be here coming back to the original grain of the son of man in Bride form the greatest day could ever be Hebrews 13 9. Hebrews 13 8 let me pick a couple we'll quit on the message proof of his resurrection he said he's the same in every way that he was then that he was then so if he's ever been he always is go ahead what did he say think on these things as well the last couple of quotes or three he's got to be the same in every way except a cardinal body you know then he says except a car he said a Corporal body you know and then we go around well look at the mistakes you man he's ever in every way he was then he's still the same he's the same yesterday today and forever sirs we would see Jesus e22 if he's raised from the dead the infallible Christ then he's just the same today that he was he what he ever was are the scriptures found wrong what about it you say that he's the same in a certain way that's still the same message first we would see Jesus no he's the same the scripture says he's the same that was is today and will be forever same in power same in sign same in wonders same in Attitude he's got to be the same in every way that he was then so has he got to be now run in this Hebrews 13 8 and be ready to listen to this one Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever 1958 223. if it's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever the same same in power same in manifestations the same in every way he was then he is now are the scriptures wrong he is now are the scriptures wrong just simply doubted God and the reason she doubted it come on you know how I've always preached about Eve what I believe happened she knew about the promise of God that was to be brought forth I believe it I believe she knew about it but Adam just wouldn't tell her nothing because I guess in a way Adam didn't know nothing she was trying to get the promise of God to be made manifest Satan told her said they're withholding that from you they're keeping it from you what you really would brought you far and she said okay I'll just try to get underway with what I need to do he said well this year is it you see we think it was the sex act that's all we think about serpent seed is a sex act the seed of the serpent is no sex the seat of the serpent was his life that he put into her mind if she doubted God's word that he would kill her and look even after he didn't kill her she went away life and and saying Adam I told you we wouldn't die and it took three or four hundred years but she died see Satan's lies that light he's telling you and I that's why I wrote around said that should be translated instead of Eli he said the LIE the same light old Eve now let me get it in the right way to understand he didn't tell her there was a trinity right he didn't tell her hell was eternal he told her 99.99 truth missing it on Hebrews 13 8. I'm honest I don't know how you think a lot of people don't like me to make my own statements but I don't worry about it I make them cut I believe it I could think of a lot of other scriptures he could have used at that point to have emphasized what she done can't you but he said Hebrews 13 8. so when he twisted Hebrews 13 8 he had everybody that would ever come into the world outside of the Lord Jesus Christ because you know why because he was Hebrews 13. when the bride becomes the fullness or the godhead bodily the prophet told us how that would happen no leaven among you brings that which no leaven means sin all gone unbelief all gone Doubt's all gone somebody's going to stand and face Satan and say sorry oh boy you missed it but who's going to do it come on musicians Hebrews 13 8. it's just so small of a thing that we could think of would be the greatest of all things but I hope you caught what I was saying verse 7 is one that we never read we don't want to read verse 7. where it says to consider the end of their conversation and if somebody don't speak to you according to Hebrews 13 8 that he's the same and then somebody come on well we just don't seem healing today say you're not you're not with Hebrews 13 8 it's going to move on at least you're to be man and woman enough to say as far as I'm concerned he never should say this is the way it is we don't see nothing going on open your eyes we've seen the dead Rays we've seen the sick healed we've seen rain come we've seen Rain Go we've seen a lot of things take place in this little old building since July the 4th 1971. a lot of healings and a lot of things has taken place but a lot of word that's been preached that to me proves Hebrews 13 8. more than the signs and the Wonders it's whether or not the word is preached amen let's stand 40 47 in the red book anybody have a need to order it over I am weak but Thou Art strong Jesus keep me from our own as I walked in the name of Jesus Christ we send these prayer Clause but we believe that you're the same yesterday today and that whatever we have need of it'll be worked out for your honor and Glory and we thank you for it We Praise Your Great Name In Jesus amen ique coming let's see let it be dear Lord let it be father in the name of Jesus Christ our brothers got to go to the kidney doctor tomorrow and we pray when he gets her all is well because we love you we believe him we thank you we believe truly that the heart Hebrews 13 8 and if you'd be standing here with me you would say the same thing by your stripes our brother's healed in Jesus name he said if God was standing here in this said he couldn't heal you Jesus who talks about another job and things well let's believe it'll always it all would be well we love you in Jesus name anybody else just believe it down waiting in my feeble life is all right Lord you heard the testimony you worked out even the man's jobs and worked and the things to make it all well because he believed you amen and he thanks you father who testifies and believes it in Jesus name amen today walking close to thee let it be in the name of Jesus Christ we were a little sacrifice let everything be all right because we believe just think about it the same clear Lord remember me it's all right anybody else would just have a knee you just think about it whatever he done he'll do let it be whatever he was he still is it's us that's given the problem you ever heard the prophet say this he said he just wants one person to believe him he said he don't need a whole bunch he said just one person to believe him that's something isn't it well now in a way I believe him see that won't work I hope that won't work I heard him talking there one day and it really struck me he said you know how this visions and this thing that works he said it's all a revelation I thought well you know that's right God would just reveal to him what was wrong with the person and tell them their name and all the doings and it would be just as real there is the Lord telling them that was just one God never seek God for a revelation you ever pray for a revelation thank God father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us tonight Lord we just ask you to help us we tried our best to express what we believe about you because we we've always believed that you are real and that you want to manifest yourself with your people and we've never doubted the end of little things that would take place that we would give honor and glory for those small things because they're just as great as the larger things because there's no negative in you lord it's all positive everything is right and for you to just touch me with a toothache take it away that's just as real as it would be to raise the dead because it took the same God to do it and we just ask your lord to help us to not forget to thank you for everything we love you in Jesus name excuse me we got one more Standing on the Promises of Christ the highest I will shout and sing father in Jesus name stand and just make a hold of me right It's Your Love in Jesus name touch your stomach all over whatever it is in Jesus name stand ing Standing on the Promises I cannot fail when the island storms are down and fear a Sail by Living Word of God I shall Prevail I'm standing on my promises of God standing standing Standing on the Promises of God my savior standing standing I'm Standing on the Promises of God Standing on the Promises I now can see perfect present cleansing in the blood for me
