========================================

you from the spirit realm then we have knowledge of who that guy is but when you're not born again you have no discernment you have no discernment it's just all together we did what we wanted to do there was no oh yeah there was a little something in there said hey you don't really need you don't need to do that right but you know what we did it anyway that's why did why did we do it anyway when we don't it now the Soul's been changed the soul has been cleaned up the soul is God doesn't make a mistake never did a wrong I thinking back in that Genesis 126 CU you know that's my favorite scripture I love to preach on it that thing that was made there in the beginning was the theophany of God it was the soul of God which is now inside of you by the new birth never did have a beginning never did have an end that's why brother R said the new birth Earth is the most important thing that you could ever have is to realize your soul is now God with no memory of your past there's your sea of God's forgetfulness now we remember in our spirit realm it just works I don't know about you works on me all the time but down inside that guy's not remembering the bad things you did it can if it's God can it there's no way it can there's no way it has a bad memory there's no way I had a bad thought there's no way I'd imagine stuff oh come on somebody see what I'm talking about see what you got when you got to New Birth you got God the perfect part that's why he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect that's where you came from everybody with me so the soul there's your remember that's your that's your key faith or doubt all right but now when you die and you go across the curtain of time all right let's say you're not born again your soul is still there not the sixth Dimension your soul is still here there here here you you have the memory reason conscious effects and Imagination you take what you remember there cuz you're a sinner you've not been cleaned you not been wiped out that's why brother Brown said a a sinner is resurrected in the body they sinned in and will'll have to give an account of what they did but you and I I only got to give an account of what he did that's all I got to give account of brother Danny it's what he did I put everything I got on what he did he took my sin he took my shame and he's inside of you tonight so that's what goes to the sixth Dimension and then in that sixth Dimension you don't just have you don't have past memory you have all the memory remember brother R comes across the curtain of time his body's still there so he's still got a connection he's not dead he's just moved over into a faster dimension in his soul with me their memory says if you had not come we would not have been here now where' that come from that come from what they took over there their soul and their Spirit went over here in a faster Dimension and it not only enhanced what you it just made you God all over perfect love is God's love perfect love is Perfect Memory perfect conscience perfect affection oh listen what you got tonight if it's a piece of God it's all of God but we're not complete those people that got to come back and get their body because you're a unit and that unit is not why did why didn't why didn't those people in the curtain of time say well we're fine here brother we don't want to go back remember he said he didn't want to go back he said do I got to go get back in that they said 'y yeah you got to go back said but we'll be judged with you we've got to come back to earth with you to get our what to get our mortal bodies cuz we're human beings we're not fully human here right we're theophany we're Eternal but why wouldn't they want to stay if I if you ever got me in an eternal State why would you want to go back there why really why would you want to go back but see there Revelation showed them that when they got back over there according to the prophet's message when they got back into their body it became glorified then you don't have to worry about the sin curse anymore you don't have to worry about my Lord I'll be 63 tomorrow yeah I know I'm not going to go there everybody wish me happy birthday today I know what y'all doing it's in case you forget tomorrow I have a way of reminding you but I've got these little spots that come up that wasn't there three or four years ago all you older ones are laughing younger ones are going what are they talking about I got hair where I don't need it I don't have it where I need it that's because that's because of the sin curse but that's all going to be brother B you you're baldheaded he said I ain't lost one of them that theophany had not lost one of them that 18 year old kid never lost a hair you love the Lord I mean he give us a revelation of who we are and what we're doing here and what peace and part of us by knowledge that's why I'm coming to this knowledge part by by knowledge we understand and we can divide rightly divide the word of Truth know that Satan is talking to us only in our spirit realm that God is talking us to though to us though through our Center realm which is the soul Chief which one wins one I feed the most feed the outside man you'll get what the outside man is you feed that inside man if it's born again if it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's God talking didn't brother I'm saying now deity resides in man deity resided in Jesus Christ at one time but now deity resides in The Bride of Jesus Christ that's what the world is not going to ever see and if they thought he was a devil they going to think you one too cuz you're not normal you do things different what you think different your control tower is different I think Paul says talk about yielding your members well that's not these not yielding these it's yielding those memory reason conscious affection those members you're going to put toward what God's affection not the affection of this world listen this world will love you to Hell come on somebody this world will love you to hell I ain't never used one of these before but it will like what brother said the other day look how close Judas was to the Gates of Heaven he kissed it he literally kissed the Gates of Heaven that's how close he was to Heaven he hugged the Lord Jesus and said Jesus said friend what in other words friend what are you doing and he kissed him that's how close he was to the Gates of Heaven and he wound up in hell same way with me and you how close I don't want to know how close I can get to the gates of hell I want somebody saying enter in to the joy of the Lord made for you when before the foundation of the world before you messed up in your Humanity before you made a mistake in your human being in your human body before all that and then right here I will restore to you the years that all that was beat down Fellowship Revelation faith that was eat down folks that was prevalent in the first church age it was okay in the second Church age then he really started eating brother Brown said like at nah he eat it down to a stump but he said I will restore you and I are in that part of that it's not it's not restoring we're not Shu this age is not Shu this age is wheat seed what went in the ground sure all that had to come back up life had to come through it but remember when you harvest corn when you harvest that corn that stock dies there's no life in it there's no way it can there's no way it can reproduce itself why cuz this went the seed but praise God his seed put it in the ground it will grow something else I will restore to you the years of locust eat canker worm caterpillar pommer worm my great Army i s among you you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God I hope we get to it we're going to talk a little bit about teaching and and what teaching does for us if we get to it if we don't we'll do it couple weeks and praise the name of the Lord that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you should never be ashamed to be a Christian if you're ashamed to be a Christian you ain't one well I might might what you might let your light shine and let somebody see it cuz this world is like really dark if y'all have not noticed that look at all that happened in California a six-year-old kid gets the gun off of Daddy's he should have been well I don't say he shouldn't have been shot but the daddy should have never left that there but that six-year-old kid he watches movies he watches video games oh I'm just going to go to my teacher and well she did or he did whichever one I can't remember it was a guy a little boy I guess six years old six what were you doing at six I couldn't hardly walk and they're picking up guns now and the parents are letting them it's all parental delinquency folks once you see what's going on it is the parents fault that's right when they took out prayer and they took out the Bible and they took out punishment in the schools look what happened a bunch of a bunch of intellectual ual idiots when it comes to here when it comes even to the world just to live listen you didn't hear none of that when we were growing up the worst you had was maybe two girls got mad at each other for dating the same boy and they whacked each other around and pulled each other hair and then it was done worst fight I ever seen was two women two girls Bible says something about a woman's scorn so anyway praise the Lord any Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand doctr who who us them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast no where your soul is I don't mean is is with God where your spirit is with God cuz if your soul is born again one more time you're just as Eternal as God is you've just got a human being attached to it right and we have to cuz we fell because of Eve what happened between Eve and the Beast that's where we came from but you know what you can't blame it on Eve now you have the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life in front of you tonight you going to eat one or you going to eat the other one of the two and Bible said we'll read it in just a minute God told him if you eat of that tree you're going to die if you eat of this tree that's why it's called a tree of life and we're heading toward adoption I hope yall see that that we're not it's not an adoption like you adopt a kid we talked about it last week about how you say a girl can't have or a sister can't have a kid and she goes and adopt a kid from a foster home or that's not what this is talking about this in the Bible is talking about taking your own son your own son and seeing how he grows and how he listens to the tutor or the teacher and how good that he obeys his teacher and obeys his parents then God will adopt you into the family of God not adopt you into the family like you never was he's going to give you more power that's what brother brandham really the whole the whole message sums up in one thing he G he he come to open the book to give us power that we lost in the church ages because of that bug eating everything down we lost it cuz he shut the door we couldn't get to what we couldn't get to the door I am the door he said to the Sheepfold all right let's look at this real quick knowledge add to Virtue knowledge no cease which is science knowledge I want to read this right here we've been reading it before but such as belongs to the more advanced you say well I don't know anything an excuse listen God does not mind that you didn't go through the seventh grade sixth grade 10th grade brother Brown was seventh grade but he was an intellectual Einstein as far as the scripture he was an intellectual Einstein he was a supernatural Einstein that could look into the mind of God where where Einstein with his own human brain that I would assume I'm not trying to put him to hell but if he didn't get born again that's where he's ending up he can be the smartest man in the world give us all kind of Technology not born again doesn't matter about all that but such as belong to the more advanced especially if things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as seen and right living then Genesis 2:9 we talked about this again out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree the Tree of Life where in the midst of the garden the Bible says in the midst of the paradises of God in the midst in the middle in that Soul that's the most important part listen you can go back crazy in your spirit and still be born again in your soul completely crazy and be born again in your soul you can let a demon get on you and you can do things that you really didn't want to do come on somebody look at that Preacher Brother rown said he was a Believer he was a preacher of the gospel for his time he said I ain't preaching no more he got a spirit on him and that Spirit drove him to drinking well God just went ahead and just took him on home his life got real short at that point in time cuz he couldn't get that thing off of him we need to get that off of us not that drinking Spirit but any Spirit we got attached to us it's in that Spirit realm and it's it's trying to affect your soul it can't move your soul it can't take your soul away from you but it can affect it that's what these that's what these virtues do because remember they would come that Satan would come to Jesus it is written he had knowledge to tell him the right thing at the right time look at the Pharisees they give him all this all these questions and he said let me ask you one did David say when he said the Lord said unto my Lord is he talking to this Lord or that Lord what the Bible tell you they never ask him another question after that why it confounded them by the knowledge of God that was in that man that same knowledge can be in you that's why we can confound of Scholars that's why we can confound the people of this world that thinks that we're you know we're we're we're so bound and we're so dos and don'ts and we got to do this and we got to no they just don't understand they're the most bound people we are free in Liberty in Jesus Christ and they are so Bound by the devil till they don't realize it now lest he put forth his hand now the Lord drove him out of the garden because if he had left them in the garden they'd have become one of us knowing all tree of life and eat and live forever so they had to drive him out and where' they drive it to they drove us out of the Garden of Eden so we could be born of a man but then what happened when Jesus came Jesus said I am the way the truth of the life to go back to the Garden of Eden right brother BR said the three-fold purpose of God was what all God was he poured into Christ Christ into the church and do what take her back to the Garden of Eden cuz in Revelations 20 or 21 or 22 we see this tree of life pop back up in the new city and it is a tree then that we take the leaves off the Nations and they go outside and do all the things but that tree of life is me and you and the world is eating off of that how do you think people listen the seed life comes through the body even an ni even Paul the great prophet had to go to anas and anas prayed for him to get the Holy Ghost why didn't he just say oh it just that thing just came alive inside of me and I'm I'm good to go no God said you're not going to see for about three days I'm going to Blind you naturally you're going to need some help Saul because you didn't think you needed any help before that sent him to a place and sent ananas to pray for him to get the Holy Ghost and the scales came off of his eyes a prophet of God yeah a prophet of God our Prophet at one time was lost we good oh I want to read you something I got in a um text to me today let me read you this quote let me tell you how how much knowledge people have direct quote from headquarters the bride is making herself ready by ressing play direct quote the bride is making herself ready by pressing play my knowledge doesn't go with that that don't ring a bell I can't shout about that that actually makes me really really sad is how many people are fallen for that you might get born again under that but you'll not stay Born Again under that I'll promise you that you won't grow I'll promise you that cuz without a five-fold Ministry you can't grow that's why the Bible when you take knowledge and teaching they go together all right without teaching there's no knowledge and you have no knowledge if you don't if you're not taught anybody with me all right I can get it on my own please try that's why we're a congregation we're sheep we need shepher shepher we need somebody to run the thing we we're just that way I'm sorry that's what God Said and the Lord God look commanded demand saying of every tree of the garden you'll eat freely but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day you eat thereof thou the day thou surely shall die man-made gunpowder so we can deer hunt with it also kills about 25 thou or million people all over the world every year cars are the biggest killer in the United states there is and we made them not counting cigarettes and beer and all that other stuff that kills us everybody with me all right knowledge by knowledge by man's knowledge we die but we eat off that tree of life and just say God you said you'd feed me you said you'd do this for me you said oh that's kind of bold no that's not bold enough he said come boldly to the throne of grace ask what you will brother Brown said ask for big things well I don't know about that I that's one thing gets under my skin is somebody tries to be humble that's not but y'all got to listen to me today press play Under the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things sayith who holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walk in the midst of seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and labor in thy patience look look how the holy spirit is going through the church in the first church age Ephesus he's going through the church and he's Discerning what they're seeing and what they're not seeing a't know what's happening now he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are apost and are not and has found them liars and has born as patience for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless here we go to the human part here we go to the spirit realm we know they were born again in the in the first church age amen there was a born again powerful group of people but they fell from their first love they fell away from the love that they had in the beginning nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from when thou are falling and repent and do the first works or else I will come quickly and remove your Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nians hatest the Deeds of the Nick God hates yes he just said he did God hates those deeds he hates for the leoty to be conquered by one head person I'm reading the Bible you can argue with it if you want to he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church now listen that's not your natural ear that's not that well there's a ear up here somewhere I thought there was seed fi up here I think yeah right there that's not that ear right there thank you brother Joe that's not that ear right there you can sit here and listen to the message for 50 years and die and go to hell but if you'll ever hear what the spirit says to you you'll not die you'll go to heaven he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life was in the midst of the paradise of God here we go teaching Whom Shall he teach knowledge that's what we were saying a minute ago and Whom Shall he make understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast I know that I I know I know I know for a fact from the 20 something years I've been back at um serving the lord that you see people that just struggle over the little stuff the little stuff but the Bible said it's the little foxes that's right listen just like I stumbled just now it was that little leg I wasn't looking at that stumbled me if it had been a big brick there I'd have probably seen it I said probably but you see what I mean that's why I stumbled over because I didn't see it how many times you been walking in a yard and you stumbled over a rock and it didn't stick up but about that high thank you brother all the time you need to be careful Lord have mercy brother get you a cane or something but that's what you stumble over you stumble over the LI if you see a great big rock there you just walk around it that's what we're looking at now everybody's got to start small though everybody's got to get those little things out of the way all of us do we need to be wise in God not wise in the World Knowledge the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity do you is is this message familiar to you but now I ask you another question can you live it it can be familiar I've seen a lot of people know the message read the message and they walk out that door and their hair is just straight across and your hair don't usually grow that way no ain't it happening so don't fool me and don't fool God all right don't take discernment to see stuff like that but we're familiar look with something with familiarity gained what through experience our association I come to this church because I believe it's preaching the truth not just me everybody all the all the ministry we have here is preaching the truth amen that's why I come here and that tells me I'm going to associate with this group of people I'm not going to associate with that group now I I'm going to go out there I got to go in the world and let your light shine but I'm not going to say well well now what did Brother Bown say one time he said he said don't you let some little Ricky tell you you go to my church one Sunday and I'll go to your church the next Sunday I'm quoting brother brandom he said don't you do that you're on the Devil's Ground now how many I've heard people in the message well I think I'll just go over here for a little while let my light shine yeah buddy you didn't see them no more either must they either got put out or something happened but I can walk I feel if you're an a mature Christian you can walk into a Baptist Church and sit there when they're having a meeting get something out of it but let your light shine and not get caught up in it now want to ask you a question though can you go to another message church and discern what they're preaching and be able to sit there and fellowship with them that's the question I ask you the circumstance or condition of what apprehending truth go get truth apprehending truth are fact through reasoning come let us reason together John 8 8:31 says then then said Jesus to those Jews which we already read this but I'm going I'm going give you the no part if you continue my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth not know of it listen zillions of peoples read this Bible but there's only going to be a small group of people that really knows what it says amen all right and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now listen if we know the truth and it's in the Bible what's written in the Bible if we know that truth and we do it then it promis us to set us free not bind us set us free right and that word know means to perceive or understand get a knowledge of feel understand perceive have knowledge of to understand it's a Jewish idiom for sexual intercourse between a man and a woman a woman knows a man I know no man she said Jesus said depart from me I never knew you that word KN and e w is exactly right there I never had a personal relationship now Jesus Christ does have nothing to do with sex act so so for those that are I want you to understand one thing that is a that is an example that the Lord does make love to us through agape love not FAL love amen and it's not in the womb anywhere else but in mind your mind the womb of our mind is where we have our relationship with Jesus Christ with the control tower is where we have that relationship to become acquainted with to know to the Greeks it's meant to know facts but these facts may or may not affect one's conduct now this one will the one I know the person I know it will impact my conduct or affect my conduct to the Jew true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct one did not know something until that fact had a practical outworking in his life Proverbs 3:13 says happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that GTH understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain therefore then find gold wow now see that's totally opposite we're we we would I'm sorry we're humans if it says silver and gold we'd want it just go ahead and I'm going to just say it for you yeah amen the Bible says to try for wisdom and understanding and it will be greater or better than having silver and gold in your hand cuz you know what with wisdom and understanding of God you can't go to hell but with a handful of silver and a handful of gold you can and you will remember the Rich Young Ruler he said I lived all Ten Commandments Lord uh and in another place I Built Barns because I didn't have enough Barns and I put stuff over here and I put stuff over here where'd he end up in hell she she is more precious now now you see what you see what the writer is telling us in Proverbs we know it's Solomon he takes that wisdom and understanding and makes it into a she now who is she she is him she's the bride she is more precious the bride is more precious than rubies and all the things thou cast desire are not to be compared to this bride amen Length of days and is in her right hand and her left hand riches in honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace she is a tree of life what a promise she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is everyone that retaineth her Philippians 1:9 you know I read that scripture and I think you remember when when the the ark was stolen and the Philistines took it and put it over in their um Tabernacle or whatever you want to call it de or whatever it was they put the thing there and the next day they come back and Deon was you know knocked down on the ground and they pick that great big statue up and they say well maybe somebody knocked it over or maybe a mule come through here or a bull and they pushed it up well after about the third time they you know what they do what they say get this thing out of here get this thing out of here and that's what people you'll do to people right remember my little thing that brother dick gave me my spirit irritates your demons only brother dick could come up with that and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in what all judgment and then we come to Corinthians we talked about it Sunday where the Saints will judge the world and then the Saints will judge Angels how much more are things that pertain to this life we shouldn't have to go outside these walls to settle a legal dispute between two brothers or two sisters or whatever we you know it should be done right here we should be able to be able to judge that if then you have Judgment of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church he's even telling Paul saiding look don't let the don't let the guy that that you know don't let the deacon do it take it to the guy that don't know much just start it let him do it that's what it says right here set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church wow that's putting God on displays what it's doing God's proving who he is if you got a born again Christian he's proven who he is brother Brown said knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge cuz that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge everything has to do with judge with judging all right but when you can see the scriptures not contradictory that you can say that and can see by the revelation of God the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and only the of God can reveal it that's why the Bible says you can't understand who Jesus Christ is without the Holy Ghost cuz that's that guy in your control tower that's going to what he's going to bring you back to that Center to that tie poost cuz listen we fail every day we backslide we go out brother what brother R say the only way Satan can get to you is what you go out to his ground you stay hid behind the word of God he can't get to you right let's try that sometime cuz I mean really we we've come to a place I thinking about this the other day we've come to a place that and we do have a lot of knowledge and we do have a lot of and and it has to be head knowledge first all right it's got to come heading knowledge first all right you got to run it through the filter you got to run it through the gray matter you got to run it through all them fire mechanisms and all that stuff that's going off you know and stuff putting over here and moving over here you got to remember what God Said in the word of God you got to be able to see it but to discern we'll talk about in just a minute to discern a a a Christian is just born again not more than you know month or two they start Discerning from the spirit and the Soul cuz what happens is you've got it all together then what happens is the word is a discern turn ER of the thoughts intents of the and intents of the heart it starts pulling it apart and were you never in your life thought things so different you're at awe when God gives you a revelation how many of you were how many of you were trinitarians before you came to the message okay you was almost well sister Anna was so sorry you're not now I said was was is a good word she was but you had that ingrained in your spirit realm and if you weren't born again at the time your soul was happy with that I was happy to set in the Baptist Church I was happy to set in the Presbyterian Church I was happy to set in my own church most of the time that's where I was the Church of Wade Dale well praise praise God I'm just the only one that's been a center of my life I guess but the knowledge of God reveals and starts pulling that thing apart and don't you remember the day when you first saw water baptism when you first saw there was no eternal hell when you first saw there was one God not three that's when you saw that now what did you have in your mind before in your human mind in the spirit realm you had this three gods right but when God revealed it to you it took that part of your memory listen you can still remember why you were in the Baptist Church and I still remember the things I did and all the uh in the world and all that but it's beginning to dull it's beginning to dull away time is beginning to move I think by the word of of the Lord too it's it's starting to wash us cuz we're supposed to be washed by the word of the word we're supposed to have the mind of Christ and we're supposed to be uh yeah we can't help the thoughts come but we can what not let it Nest well we used to let it Nest we used to let it build a condominium everybody with me well I mean it built condominium had flowers and trees and all that stuff yeah that's how our yeah that's how them thoughts were but now they come as a breeze and they blow away you see a sinner can't see that a CER cannot you couldn't fathom that when somebody Tom barush bless his heart he'd say boy Jenny you know who he is he said boy we waiting on you I ain't going if you're not going and I can't go till you go he said so hurry up well you know what that didn't to me that just went after a while I mean the impact of of his great big hand doing that point that finger about that big around at you that was an impact but after a while though Jenny it was like you know weeks or so later I just went right back it didn't bother me and you know I just but he did that one time when I was born again had a different impact my firing mechanism had changed a little bit my spiritual eye had been open my spiritual ear had been open to know that that was God been speaking to me the whole time through that man the whole time speaking to me through that person but it took what the eyes of our understanding have been what enlightened so that we can understand these things now brother Brown said look then when you get and say and punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith then here's a prayer I love this prayer Build Me Up Oh Lord into this let Christ be my head that works through me on my Foundation my faith is in him let virtue knowledge Temperance patience godl brotherly kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer I don't care live or die how many of you can say that Li die sneak or Swim I'm going to make a Rapture am man I don't care you're not going to stop me there ain't nobody going to stop me but me so then what you know look if look if nobody can stop me but me where's the devil in that picture for God has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists to press play all for the good Lord all for the perfecting and bringing all this now that was quoted by their higher up that was quoted by their number one guy okay so we'll just leave them alone but I'm going to tell you something that's of the devil you can't do that and stay in the word of God you can't you just pray pray for them and just you leave them people alone all right each one of these stones are Material off of that one this is Material off of this each one of these virtues belong into him and they're pouring out of him where into you down through them 70 weeks of Daniel I love this and I and I've been honing in on this Spirit of wisdom because it takes a spirit of wisdom to do all kind of things takes a spirit of wisdom to get a sermon that that y'all want it's not the one I want the one y'all want you operate the gift you make the gift work I don't you do so the spirit of wisdom comes look it didn't say it comes into the preacher it says comes into the church to make known to the church or the bride by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day we're living in just the same as Gabriel came to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the what comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things praise God we can understand them if you want to cuz when we say deep people just go don't do that don't do that when we say deep God told us through a prophet and in the Bible it even tells us that we can know even the Deep things of God because the Deep things of God is so shallow if you're a Christian if you'll get taught if you'll learn if you'll sit and do what God Said to do remember to get these virtues is one thing that's doing what God Said to do be in obedience to what God Said to do right there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse talking about Jesus Christ and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him Spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel that's why that spirits come back into the church to get us out of here you know what Spirit of wisdom we have now we have we have the spirit of wisdom of the son of man we don't have partial truth we have full truth we don't have to worry about being right or wrong I hope y'all know that if you're sitting here today worried whether this is the right message or the wrong message go go find you a tree somewhere and get under it and stay there until God brings you a revelation CU there's nothing like this message of the hour nothing it'll light you up it'll turn your refrigerator into a stove some of y'all still got icicle that the god of our Lord Jesus the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation what in the knowledge of him not the knowledge of the world and knowledge of him the eyes of look there here it is the eyes of your understanding yours being enlightened that you may know what does that word know that you may have an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ what is the hope of his calling what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints I'm not going to get finished so I'm going to skip through Just Close Your Eyes cuz some of the people might make you sick when I start scrolling there's nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word of God listen we want power in this church get a revelation of the word of God get a revelation of where you at give a revel get a revelation of why you're doing here why are you here why are we here why are in the things we're doing why are you doing this why are we doing that there's nothing of such what is prevailing power now you can have power but what is prevailing power see you can have a lightning bolt and that's power but prevailing power is this is prevailing power as long as you keep them up that power will prevail over everything else and stay on so listen let's get our switch flipped right right that's all it is the power's already listen the power's running through them lines right now it's just not got the right connection yet and you know where it's at it's not back there it's right here right here this is where it's at watch oh look at there that's why God wants to make it so simple when we make it so hard so simple as flipping a light switch power's already there revelation of Jesus Christ listen but the prevail overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God look we can expect God to reveal his truth to us that's a prophet telling us that he expects God to do this right and so do we because it's the word of God any promise in the word of God Is Ours amen so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism it's right there staring you in the face I bet you let me see when that was that was in when he preach those 60 or 61 cuz I don't have it I got cut it off it's it was the revelation of Jesus Christ the little bitty books there was a lot of trinitarians sitting in that congregation at that time a lot and he just burnt their hide right in front of them he said this is right here staring you in the face no man knows the things of God say the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them brother M said we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world well brother way brother way I need this I need this pray for Revelation if you have a problem pray for Revelation if you have an issue pray for Revelation more than anything else in the world you have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truth of it we got all the truths now but it's still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there it's words on a page we're message believer what message do you believe well I don't believe brother R was right over here but he was right over here I don't believe this is right over here I don't believe brother so and so's right and it's not right and that's not boy it's like Paul Harvey said one time talking about brother about this message being a cult he said he said no said the message is not a cult a cult they follow their leader just saying look what God's I mean look what God's give us in the end time and what Satan's doing he's going right to the top he's going to tear it down make us make us doubt whether the 12 people fell off the bridge I don't care right yeah but he was supposed to be and he I don't care he has has brought me a Clarity to the word of God more than any other man James doson all them people included and that's what I'll put my soul on on that because that man can make a mistake but that God can't somebody said one time said I'll believe I I would believe brother brandom's opinion rather than most people's Revelation right that's about true but look we'll close right here I don't have time to get any further but this is talking about you it says because the revelation of the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened mechanics Dynamics all right the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ now that's that Center guy right there that Union is in that middle realm called The Soul it's did you get it it says that we are are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that by our Union with him by what by knowing him amen by knowing him the people that know their God will do exploit if we accept the fight and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other which one you want to accept tonight amen you you think about it now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing that's is the prophet it is not real to the majority look it's not real to the majority of God's children not the devil's kids you know what he's talking about he's talking about a further walk with God he's talking about okay you're born again you're in the family of God you're in the line of adoption you're just not going anywhere you're malnourished you quit eating you quit fellowshipping you don't come to church you don't do you don't read your Bible you don't study how you going to get something from God can't it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children it is just a good verse in the Bible or a good quote but we need to have it made alive to us that will take revelation what is a revelation somebody you know what's your idea of a revelation to me it's like that aha moment you have you you you just didn't see something and all of a sudden who it was there all the time you know I love math and man I mean you could there was there would be a piece left out or something and you couldn't understand it but once that piece of the puzzle or once you got to your A's and B's and C's and and no I know shake your head it's okay no we're not no boy boy want to play an instrument he says D and F and C that's not it when you get to a plus b and then all the squares and somebody told me the other day what I was missing who was that told me that Adam was it you or or Levi when I was talking about a number that just kept repeating itself that it never wasn't it didn't have a a definition it's pie what is it and it just keeps going there's no end to it well that's not God in that aspect cuz they just using that as you know it it fits but it don't fit everything so now as you're confused we'll move right along for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a baby can't understand a plus b equals c but once I got to that part of a I told you many times what helped me was my uh college football I mean baseball coach he would give us the answer and we we had to back it into we had to make the not the question but we had to put all the numbers in to get to that and that was hard it's hard enough getting everything together and then getting the answer but when he wrote The Answer up the board and you had to create the problem that was a problem that's why I was called that but strong meat belongs to them that are of what of full age even those who by look by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil to discern means to separate make a distinction discriminate or to prefer we are Discerning right now you're Discerning God's Discerning your thoughts and intents he's taking me down one road that you need and he's taking me down another road somebody else needs he's taking you to when the brother comes up here and preaches that you've never met before and he preaches like you swear he was in your house last night how'd you know that well it wasn't him it was the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart brother brandham had it in a great gift worldwide we have it in little bitty gift discernment has not left a church but now that part of the discernment one gift to one generation brother rown said when you can bring that person up here discern it 100% and do it not two or three times do it hundreds of thousands of times right see now it happens hundreds of thousands of times all over the world it's not in one person it's all over the world that discernment and I wrote myself a note teach us cuz watch this preach the word be instant in season out of season magicians get ready to come reprove rebuke it s with all go ahead and actually come on with long all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will tell you to press play when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves look Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from what the truth and shall be turned into fables second Peter 2:1 but there were false prophets among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring IND damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and brought unto them Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways pernicious is the same word as predition Judas was the son of what predition confusion destruction all right so it will follow in their destructive Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of wow be in the message and talk evil of the messenger how in the world can you do that let's stand our feet Hebrews 5:11 says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing that word dull is slothful slow sluggish indolent dull and languid it's just like for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principle of the Oracles of God you know what the first principle of the Oracle of God is The Ten Commandments that's what the Jews had you know what Paul's saying Paul's saying please get up here in the in the New Testament but it looks like all you need is you need to be taught the simple things of the Ten Commandments first that's a good place to start but let's don't stay there you do not have to tell anybody in this building I hope not that thou shalt not kill okay or commit adultery or all the other what other Commandments we shouldn't have to preach about that all the time but he said Paul said you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat let me read this real quick having a form of godliness so there people going to have a form of godliness but deny what deny what I was talking about not deny that there's a Bible not deny that there's a God not deny that there's a prophet not deny that there's a message but you deny the power of it you deny the power of it from such I'm going I'm going to interject or interpolate from such run away not turn away run away it will do you no good look for this sword are they which creep in the houses leading captive silly churches women of churches right Laden with sins let away with many lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth last one let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised it and let us consider one another to provoke and to love and good works not forsake who put that in there again not forsaking this s of of ourselves together as a matter of some is but look exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching for if we sin willfully now look I'm going to say this one more time when if a preacher preaches something and it's the truth and he preaches it presents it to you in ABC like this right here you need to be in church every time the doors open for if you sin willfully after you have received that knowledge there's no more sacrifice for your sins I'm just reading you the Bible we wonder why we're tossed about it's because we don't do everything God says instead of brother brother Dale preached matching pieces years ago we got missing pieces I me too all of us we got missing pieces that's why he preached matching pieces cuz when what matches down here matches up there they're going to cnct remember vulcanized but can't be Rubber and Bricks it's got to be rubber to rubber vulcanized together now remember this Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church look defile it make it loot War formal and Powerless that doesn't sound like the word I'm used to it exposes Satan revealing his work the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word and let me inter interject something and God's people and God's Prophet amen right down to the time he is cast in the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true re revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Revelation what of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church not that church out there this church right here within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern by knowledge that's why that knowledge is so down at the bottom here at the pyramid we got to have that we've got to have knowledge and with stand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be what say that with me powerless before her one more time powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with a true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail
