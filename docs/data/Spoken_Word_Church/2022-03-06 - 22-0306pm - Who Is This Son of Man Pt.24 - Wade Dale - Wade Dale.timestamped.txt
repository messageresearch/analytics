[13:28] and
[13:29] brother isaac um
[13:32] he
[13:34] he got a um just just a little
[13:37] um i guess a little tug in his heart
[13:40] because they would sit around in the uh
[13:42] in their living room or his living room
[13:44] and watch the services online and you
[13:46] know that's kind of not like church it's
[13:48] kind of just
[13:50] it's kind of like some of y'all you know
[13:51] that
[13:52] stayed out during covid you just put
[13:53] your jammies on and
[13:55] and kicked your feet up and watch the
[13:57] service and turned it off when you
[13:58] wanted to and let the dogs run through
[13:59] the house and everything else well we
[14:01] don't do that here so
[14:03] so they had a um
[14:05] they had a purpose in their heart to uh
[14:08] to have a place of worship so if you
[14:09] pull it up on the screen
[14:11] this is

[20:53] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[20:55] the dead that in all things

[21:59] yeah regina really old
[22:01] and
[22:05] we just all family
[22:06] anyway
[22:08] all right well that we talked about
[22:09] preeminence and i want you to understand
[22:11] that it says to be first and hold the
[22:13] first place that's what preeminence
[22:14] means
[22:15] and that's what we even even when we
[22:17] were
[22:19] when we were babies
[22:21] see we didn't know how to
[22:23] uh josh when he was a little boy
[22:27] the first word he said was what
[22:30] most of you know mama does
[22:32] hot
[22:34] hot he put his hand up on the
[22:37] stove that jim was cooking put his hand
[22:39] up near near the stove and say hi
[22:42] huh
[22:43] your stove at nanny's house i'm sorry
[22:45] stopping that he's saying hot well see
[22:48] he understood one thing
[22:50] don't put your hand on that
[22:53] amen
[22:54] but he knew it was hot so he knew by
[22:56] learning not to touch that and that's
[22:58] the same thing with me and you
[23:00] as we start up the statue of a perfect
[23:02] man even in our in our natural journey
[23:04] of life we start out making plenty of
[23:07] mistakes

[24:13] i mean you know daddy didn't whip me for
[24:16] for crashing the car and i never got in
[24:18] one
[24:19] right it was after i crashed the cars
[24:21] when he beat us to death or half to
[24:23] death so
[24:25] he never did that but mama did but he
[24:27] didn't so
[24:30] we survived hey my head shows it's still
[24:33] got knots in it
[24:36] but look it's child training so that's
[24:37] the way in god the same thing we try to
[24:39] make this thing so this christian walk
[24:41] so hard but it's you just need to mirror
[24:44] it the way the way you grew up
[24:47] the way you started out and the way you
[24:49] came up in god is the same way you come
[24:51] up you come up bottle feeding you come
[24:53] up with you know your mama now my mama
[24:56] did it i don't know if y'all did it my
[24:57] mama would sometimes she kind of crush
[24:59] her food up before she fed it to us we
[25:00] didn't have all that processed stuff
[25:02] where they ground it for you she'd have
[25:04] to mash it up and then you know peas and
[25:06] carrots and all that stuff and feed it
[25:07] to us i think she may eat it and then
[25:09] give it to us
[25:10] but chewed on it but um
[25:13] but that's what god does though what god
[25:14] doesn't just shove stuff down your
[25:16] throat
[25:17] he doesn't just take a great big piece
[25:18] of meat now look
[25:20] dad and i we ate a big old steak
[25:21] yesterday at longhorns
[25:24] don't feed that to the cambrie or or
[25:26] somebody little what was it do it choke
[25:29] him
[25:30] it'll choke him and kill him
[25:32] and god knows better than we do and
[25:34] better than our natural parents he knows
[25:36] what we need at the time we need it we
[25:38] just gotta cry as we'll talk to and
[25:40] meant i by father so romans 8 14
[25:44] for as many years are led by the spirit
[25:45] of god they are the sons of god
[25:47] for we have not received the spirit of
[25:49] bondage again to fear but we have
[25:50] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[25:52] we cry babies
[25:54] daddy daddy all right but now there's a
[25:56] time where what did he tell moses one
[25:58] time he said moses why cry
[26:02] speak
[26:03] and go forward
[26:04] and that's what god's looking at me and
[26:05] you bro the prophet of god tells us
[26:08] that god wants us to come into speaking
[26:10] condition
[26:11] now he's already spoke
[26:14] god's already spoke he's given us the
[26:15] word he's given us creation he's given
[26:17] us prophets he's given us teachers he's
[26:20] given us everything in our life but
[26:21] there's a time when he wants you to
[26:23] speak
[26:24] and you won't speak if you're if you're
[26:26] grown up enough
[26:29] because the prophet to god remember he
[26:30] said power without character
[26:33] is satanic why is that listen if god
[26:36] gave you all the power
[26:40] and you were a baby
[26:43] trouble yeah first thing you'd do is
[26:45] somebody make you mad you'd zap them out
[26:47] of existence
[26:49] right
[26:50] but now that's not god
[26:53] as you going up the statue of perfect
[26:55] man brother brown says you pray for that
[26:57] person
[26:58] you would pray for that person instead
[27:00] of condemning them or damning them to
[27:02] hell you know you understand what i mean
[27:04] that's what we do a lot of times
[27:06] but if we have patience
[27:09] godly patience
[27:11] it'll help us grow
[27:14] godly patients will help us grow regular
[27:16] patients will help us in life
[27:19] but patience with god
[27:21] how many of you
[27:22] want it and want it right now
[27:24] 99.9 of it yeah you want it you want it
[27:27] right now
[27:28] uh jim's stepmom had a had a thing in
[27:31] her kitchen that says lord give me
[27:32] patience but i want it now
[27:35] so that's the way we are
[27:37] but what happens though if we do that
[27:38] and god gives us and we step out above
[27:40] that or beyond that we make a mistake
[27:44] because we can't go out past god's
[27:45] program whatever his program is we've
[27:48] got to get in it stay in it
[27:50] right
[27:51] and then he will do what he said he
[27:53] would do
[27:55] but now if we go do our own thing we're
[27:57] going to really mess up amen but we can
[27:59] do our own thing as a child and we will
[28:02] get our fingers caught in the door we'll
[28:04] get our hand burnt we'll get our
[28:06] whatever you want to say when we're
[28:08] children
[28:09] but as we grow up we shouldn't be we
[28:12] shouldn't
[28:13] walk up to the to the oven and say
[28:18] hot
[28:19] no you don't put your hand on that
[28:21] because you've grown
[28:23] same way with god we've grown up in god
[28:26] we've had so many years lord of mercy
[28:28] we've had so many years to grow up
[28:30] and and we're slacking all of us
[28:33] we're all slacking behind on on growing
[28:35] up
[28:37] all right so let's go to the next one
[28:38] let's go to
[28:40] we talked about headship this morning
[28:42] and that's for the head of the church
[28:44] listen without a head your body can't
[28:46] work
[28:48] without a head your body can't work
[28:50] natural now you can have the prettiest
[28:52] body in the world but no head
[28:54] yeah it's not going to do anything it's
[28:55] just going to lay there all right so you
[28:57] got to have headship which is we know
[28:59] that's jesus christ and we give him the
[29:01] preeminence to take over
[29:06] but look
[29:09] we look at these i kind of shortened
[29:11] this up a little bit when under headship
[29:14] we talk about creation we're a new
[29:15] creation a brand new man we were talking
[29:17] about we were singing about it this
[29:18] morning
[29:20] but do you really believe that
[29:22] do you really believe that you've been
[29:24] recreated that you have there is a there
[29:26] is a creature
[29:29] a creation inside of you
[29:32] different from the old creation
[29:35] because if if you're still in stuck in
[29:36] this creation here then you're of the
[29:38] world and you're of the devil
[29:41] if you do the things of the world you're
[29:43] of the world and the love of god's not
[29:46] in you amen that's why we look different
[29:48] act different and people say
[29:50] there's something different about you
[29:53] why do they say that
[29:55] because they see the normal
[29:57] and then they see you and go
[29:59] why don't you and why don't you and why
[30:02] don't you you know you understand what
[30:03] i'm saying well you know why because
[30:05] something inside of us another creation
[30:08] has been made
[30:10] inside of us called the baptism of the
[30:12] holy ghost or the new birth
[30:13] the old man is dead
[30:16] and all things have become new amen
[30:19] not just divorced
[30:20] you can't divorce the old you because
[30:23] you can he'll kill he'll raise his head
[30:24] back up
[30:27] but now if he's dead
[30:31] you can accuse him all day long you go
[30:33] out in the cemetery and accuse that
[30:34] person laying there you can accuse them
[30:36] of everything in the world guess what
[30:38] they didn't do it
[30:40] because they're dead
[30:41] that's the same thing with me and you
[30:43] the old nature must die
[30:45] the old creature must die the old
[30:47] creation now we know our body still
[30:50] lives but it's that old nature that
[30:52] we're attached to
[30:53] that old person
[30:55] that would rile up when it doesn't now
[30:57] rile up that it would take a drink of
[31:00] beer or whatever you want to call it
[31:01] just you know
[31:02] brother and sister always called a
[31:03] laundry list we always have this laundry
[31:05] list i don't smoke i don't drink i don't
[31:07] cuss i don't i don't do this i don't do
[31:09] that god doesn't worry about any of that
[31:13] hello
[31:16] god wants change inside here once he
[31:18] changes inside here
[31:19] the outward appearance is gonna
[31:21] automatically happen
[31:23] amen you plant an apple tree an apple
[31:27] seed you put an apple seed in the ground
[31:29] apple tree comes up guess what comes on
[31:31] you shouldn't be surprised that you get
[31:32] apples
[31:34] right
[31:35] whatever seeds planted that's what's
[31:37] going to grow and that's what's going to
[31:38] come on the fruit at the end of the vine
[31:40] all right so that's the same way with me
[31:42] and you plant the seed of god
[31:45] amen get the new birth get into the
[31:47] kingdom of god and he will teach you
[31:50] he's obligated to his children
[31:52] he's uh just like i'm obligated to mine
[31:55] your ob god's obligated to his children
[31:58] to make you another creation
[32:01] apart from this creation as as the
[32:03] prophet of god was telling us this
[32:04] morning
[32:05] then we come down to look at
[32:06] dispensations and stages and anointings
[32:09] does everybody understand that
[32:12] we're coming through dispensations
[32:14] there's no way that me and you can stay
[32:16] in like luther
[32:18] was a prophet of god
[32:20] that's what brother i'm saying
[32:22] for his age
[32:25] amen
[32:26] luther martin luther everybody with me
[32:29] but he drank a beer and smoked a pie and
[32:32] talked about god
[32:33] because that's all god required was is
[32:35] the just shall live by faith no no venus
[32:37] don't have to pay to get you don't have
[32:39] to pay to get good
[32:41] that's what the catholic church is you
[32:42] pay us and you you pay us
[32:44] you pay us and we'll make you good
[32:46] no god's never had that in the bible
[32:48] nowhere
[32:49] amen there's no good no not one
[32:52] but the dispensation of that was clear
[32:55] that that's what god was working in at
[32:57] the time he was working and then what
[32:59] happened
[33:00] martin luther passes on john wesley
[33:02] raises up god raises up
[33:04] another prophet called john wesley and
[33:07] john wesley looks back at that and says
[33:10] i think i'll take that just shall live
[33:12] by faith plus
[33:15] get away from the smoking and the
[33:16] drinking and he did he said tea even
[33:18] didn't have any
[33:19] any uh good quality about it so he lived
[33:22] so much of a sanctified life
[33:27] and if you read the history his wife was
[33:30] pretty tough
[33:32] he had to be sanctified
[33:37] read about it she really give him a lot
[33:38] of problems
[33:40] but that's okay
[33:42] that was his thorn in the flesh i guess
[33:43] i don't know
[33:44] but he but he preached sanctification
[33:47] right
[33:49] then you come over into pentecost where
[33:51] the where the gifts came back in 1906
[33:53] the gifts were restored the holy ghost
[33:55] fell on the day of that pentecost not we
[33:57] know it fell 2000 years ago but in 1906
[34:00] the holy ghost fell
[34:02] that was a dispensation of the holy
[34:03] ghost
[34:04] that was the gifts being restored why i
[34:06] went against restorative martin luther
[34:08] and john wesley what in time
[34:10] wasn't the dispensation it wasn't the
[34:12] stage of the journey that god was on
[34:15] hello
[34:16] god's on a journey too
[34:18] amen he's gonna and you know what he's
[34:21] on that journey to make sure that we
[34:22] stay in line in that journey all right
[34:26] right place right time
[34:29] right spirit
[34:30] right dispensation
[34:32] so me and you now
[34:34] are in the age of adoption
[34:37] we've got the baptism of the holy ghost
[34:40] we've got the new birth we know it's
[34:42] justification sanctification in the
[34:43] baptism the holy ghost makes the new
[34:45] birth we know
[34:46] that but we got to stay plush too
[34:50] what happened to the pentecostals
[34:52] brother brown said they cabbage down and
[34:53] for us that don't know what that means
[34:55] they stopped
[34:57] and said this is it we've got the gifts
[34:59] working in our life we're just among
[35:02] angels we're speaking in tongues and and
[35:04] god is
[35:06] honoring what we're saying this must be
[35:08] it
[35:09] and brother branham says no
[35:11] that just gets you started
[35:13] you're just getting started at that
[35:15] point but they said no this is it and
[35:17] we're not taking any more no furthermore
[35:19] of the word of god
[35:21] because they figured they could just
[35:22] speak in tongues and just live any other
[35:23] life life they wanted to
[35:28] i was around one one time it didn't
[35:30] matter what he was doing in his life but
[35:32] as long as he was speaking in tongues
[35:34] and as long as god was you know giving
[35:36] him that feeling you know that jerk
[35:39] feeling you know he was jerking you know
[35:42] and
[35:42] he was all right
[35:44] temper to fight a buzz saw curse like a
[35:46] sailor
[35:47] but it really didn't matter to him that
[35:49] was what he grew up in that he was as
[35:51] long as he shouted and spoke in tongues
[35:53] he was fine
[35:54] but
[35:55] we got to take that plus
[35:59] there's nothing wrong with shouting
[36:00] speaking in tongues
[36:01] but that's not just all it is
[36:04] there's more to it than that and now
[36:06] we're in that age of more to it
[36:09] all right there's more to it there's
[36:10] more given there's more required you and
[36:12] i in this age are required
[36:14] to come to full adoption we've read that
[36:16] this morning but let's look at three
[36:17] divisions one
[36:19] because this is where we are we pre we
[36:21] are predestinated unto this adoption of
[36:24] children
[36:26] according as he has chosen us in him
[36:29] when before the foundation of the world
[36:30] like i said this morning jesus didn't
[36:32] come to bring us our inheritance
[36:38] he came
[36:40] to make us a way to get back to the
[36:42] inheritance
[36:45] what did
[36:48] trying to think what did boaz
[36:50] boaz was the kinsmen redeemer right
[36:53] he redeemed what naomi already had she
[36:56] had lost it like we'd lost we got lost
[36:59] but he's redeeming back what she had
[37:02] he didn't redeem back somebody else's
[37:04] stuff he redeemed back here so the same
[37:06] way with me and you he come to the earth
[37:08] to redeem those that would say yes the
[37:10] baptism of the holy ghost the ones that
[37:12] the bride of jesus christ is who he came
[37:14] for
[37:16] everybody okay with that
[37:18] i'm trying to get through this so we can
[37:19] get to a
[37:20] point but having predestinated us into
[37:23] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[37:25] to himself according to the good
[37:27] pleasure of his will
[37:29] now remember the adoption and the
[37:31] placing is two different things and
[37:32] we'll get into it in just a minute
[37:34] because it is two not totally different
[37:36] things but you can have the new birth
[37:38] and not be adopted but you can't be
[37:39] adopted without having the new birth all
[37:41] right they'll be okay with that
[37:42] all right
[37:44] just like the bible says who can call
[37:45] jesus to christ without the holy ghost
[37:47] even something simple like that yeah you
[37:49] can say well i know jesus christ yeah
[37:51] but is he a personal person to you or is
[37:54] it just somebody you know
[37:56] amen
[37:57] think about that
[37:58] all right the next thing we're going to
[37:59] go to is we're talking about this
[38:00] morning we're talking about obedience
[38:03] and we'll talk about full obedience so
[38:04] let's read the quote here full obedience
[38:11] right here
[38:12] the token is the sign that the purchase
[38:14] has been what made
[38:16] and been accepted
[38:19] amen
[38:20] made and been accepted for complete
[38:23] obedience puts you and the word one
[38:27] you believe it every bit
[38:29] and all of it's in you and you watch it
[38:32] working
[38:33] through you we're going to get into that
[38:34] because
[38:35] that's what is manifestation
[38:39] making known
[38:41] manifestation is making known what god's
[38:44] done in your life or what god's got
[38:45] inside of you or what the devil's got
[38:48] inside of you
[38:49] because excuse me the devil's going to
[38:51] manifest himself too
[38:52] he's going to manifest himself in a
[38:54] person called the beast
[38:57] pope whatever you want to call him
[38:58] he's going to manifest himself because
[39:01] listen this is as the song says this is
[39:03] manifesting time
[39:05] you will manifest what's inside of you i
[39:07] do you cannot we we've had a lot of
[39:10] people have held it back look at some of
[39:11] the people that are leaving the message
[39:12] and all the different things
[39:14] if they never had anything they hid so
[39:16] much
[39:18] they hid so much inside of their self
[39:21] but remember brother branham he went and
[39:23] prayed for that girl
[39:25] well he didn't go pray for the girl
[39:27] he talked to the girl's pastor
[39:29] remember they were talking about give
[39:30] her another hypo she said you've lied to
[39:32] us you've lied to us he said she was a
[39:34] piano player or the sunday school
[39:36] teacher and when her life when she
[39:38] started dying her real life popped up
[39:40] brother brown said or came up in other
[39:42] words
[39:43] it began to break open
[39:45] and she said i'm lost i'm lost
[39:48] and her pastor said oh sh give her the
[39:50] hypodermic needle you know get she's
[39:52] gone crazy
[39:54] what he was saying was i hadn't done my
[39:56] job shut her up
[39:57] that's exactly what he was saying
[39:59] well lord i haven't done my job you need
[40:01] to shut her up but that's what brother
[40:02] brown said the real person came up so
[40:05] there was nothing and the same thing
[40:06] with me and you as i said before
[40:08] back a couple of months ago i said
[40:10] you're going to manifest so we might as
[40:11] well just let out what we already got
[40:13] inside of us let it out
[40:15] good bad or indifferent
[40:17] let the thing out
[40:18] if it's a demon i want it out anyway
[40:21] if it's god i want to be able to show it
[40:23] because you can't get rid of god
[40:25] you get rid of the demon but you can't
[40:27] get rid of god
[40:28] once you get him you got him
[40:31] he's not an indian giver
[40:32] thank god he's not an indian giver but
[40:35] full obedience puts you in the word one
[40:37] you believe it every bit and all of it's
[40:39] in you
[40:40] and you watch it working
[40:42] through you everybody got that
[40:45] then we read
[40:47] the questions and answers number two i'm
[40:48] trying to fly through this i'm sorry i
[40:50] got to get to a point i didn't get to it
[40:52] this morning so i got to cover this
[40:53] point and the point in the afternoon
[40:56] so
[40:57] if you want to nap a little go ahead now
[40:59] and
[41:00] i'll wake you up in just a few minutes
[41:01] don't worry
[41:04] luis where's the where's louise
[41:07] oh he's in the back did y'all notice
[41:09] what he was doing did y'all hear what he
[41:10] was doing when he's up here
[41:14] he's got a tambourine on his shoe
[41:17] you notice that
[41:18] you didn't hear it i heard him in there
[41:20] it's on his shoe and it's on a it's on a
[41:22] piece of stretchy stuff and he's sitting
[41:24] there patting your foot and he's going
[41:25] ding ding ding ding ding
[41:30] so anyway
[41:31] so he's manifesting he's actually
[41:32] exactly
[41:33] letting some of that colombian come out
[41:37] not columbia south carolina
[41:40] the country of columbia
[41:43] but i i want to get to something so just
[41:46] bear with me just a second
[41:47] number two is let's go to number two
[41:51] number two on questions and answers
[41:53] he said the headstones yet to come
[41:56] all right so what is the headstone
[41:59] the headstone in the bible was jesus
[42:01] christ
[42:02] and jesus christ was rejected right
[42:06] despised rejected no one loved him
[42:08] nobody knew him until he came back on
[42:10] the day of pentecost
[42:11] but everybody left him and the bible
[42:14] says that the head has been rejected and
[42:16] he's become the chief cornerstone which
[42:18] we know that this is the headstone
[42:21] if we look at it in a picture this is a
[42:23] headstone
[42:24] it was rejected
[42:27] right that's why i had to come back
[42:31] but he became the chief cornerstone so
[42:32] look at these little corners right here
[42:34] oh june
[42:35] where's my wife
[42:37] we need to get this picture before we go
[42:39] to ohio
[42:40] so call china and see if we can get them
[42:44] all right
[42:45] doing my work while i'm here okay sorry
[42:48] if i don't i won't i won't remember it
[42:52] remember what
[42:53] but this is the cornerstone but what is
[42:55] the cornerstone it looks just like the
[42:56] pyramid jesus christ never changed
[43:00] he never changes now he changes his form
[43:03] but he never changes his attitude or his
[43:05] character
[43:06] his character is always the same so he
[43:08] started down here on the day of
[43:10] pentecost with the cornerstones
[43:13] and built up this church again
[43:16] and then in the end time
[43:17] he sent a little prophet by the name of
[43:19] william branham that we believe
[43:21] everybody got sent a prophet okay all
[43:23] right
[43:25] i just have to remind them every once in
[43:27] a while
[43:28] but this thing wasn't though there and
[43:31] it's and it's separate it's away from
[43:33] because this is the church
[43:36] the body
[43:37] this is the body
[43:40] that's the head the body's being built
[43:42] which is the bride of jesus christ and
[43:45] then we we're looking for the headship
[43:47] to come
[43:48] or
[43:49] the opening of the seals
[43:51] and we know we need to get into that we
[43:53] will that'll be something we'll get into
[43:54] a little bit later on
[43:56] but see the seals
[43:57] the seals when they open
[43:59] when the prophet of god opened them
[44:01] there in 1963
[44:04] remember jesus had already preached him
[44:06] in matthew 24 so it wasn't that much of
[44:08] a mystery but it was the greatest
[44:11] mystery
[44:13] that nobody understood what those seals
[44:15] were one two three four five six seven
[44:17] they thought it was this they thought it
[44:18] was that but then we had a little
[44:20] prophet come along
[44:22] he had to be adopted he had to be taken
[44:24] out of the mountain out there in tucson
[44:26] arizona i believe when the cloud
[44:28] appeared
[44:30] and said here you him
[44:32] so we had to hear this message
[44:34] to get the headstone back here which the
[44:36] headstone is what christ
[44:39] and the headstone is who the son of man
[44:42] the son of man is the headstone that's
[44:44] when he walked on the shores of galilee
[44:46] 2000 years ago that was the head of all
[44:49] things
[44:51] that was the fullness of the godhead
[44:53] bodily
[44:54] he actually had his bride inside of him
[44:57] he'll never go wrong
[45:00] if he's got his own bride inside of
[45:02] him but what has he got to do
[45:05] let her out
[45:07] he's got to get her out
[45:09] so on the on on
[45:11] calvary what did he do he released his
[45:13] life
[45:14] he released the bride
[45:17] and on the day of pentecost
[45:20] we've said many times before
[45:24] satan is pretty much a fool
[45:27] to know that he to think he can try to
[45:29] defeat his own creator number one
[45:32] right
[45:33] and number two if he would have left
[45:34] jesus alone jesus would have just died
[45:36] an old man
[45:39] he was a human
[45:41] but satan had to kill him
[45:44] satan had to put him on the cross and
[45:45] had to kill him but you know what he did
[45:48] he created something
[45:50] god had a creation inside of him
[45:53] and satan was just used in the hands of
[45:55] god to release it
[45:56] because on the day of pentecost guess
[45:58] what
[45:59] satan had to deal with 120 little jesus
[46:02] not just one
[46:04] then there was three thousand little
[46:06] jesus born
[46:07] hello somebody acts two
[46:09] there was two thousand down three
[46:11] thousand down in down in below the upper
[46:13] room that that was low jesus and they've
[46:16] been little jesus is born all since that
[46:18] that's a bunch of little jesus is
[46:19] sitting in here today
[46:21] amen
[46:23] pearl devil bless his heart
[46:28] i don't i do feel sorry for him but i
[46:30] don't feel sorry for him
[46:32] he can't get born again
[46:35] he just can't he he won't believe it
[46:37] but if he would get born again look at
[46:39] the problems we'd get rid of
[46:42] but ain't going to happen he's go he's
[46:44] got his place
[46:45] he's got his dispensation and he's got
[46:48] his stages to go by remember beast false
[46:50] prophet
[46:51] all that he's going to head up to what
[46:54] he's going to head up to a headstone
[46:56] he's going to be the head of this
[46:58] natural church
[47:00] satan incarnate's going to be ahead of
[47:01] this natural church god incarnate's
[47:03] going to be ahead of this spiritual
[47:04] church amen but we're going to be out of
[47:07] here when that natural church goes into
[47:09] the tribulation
[47:11] but the headstone's yet to come
[47:13] but it's on his way
[47:15] when those seals opened i believe there
[47:17] was a way made
[47:19] for me and you to see what god had had
[47:21] in his mind before the foundation of the
[47:23] world
[47:24] and not just to see the written part of
[47:26] it
[47:27] we got a revelation
[47:31] we got a revelation of that
[47:34] because the book is now open
[47:36] according to revelations 10 that the
[47:38] book was open
[47:39] when the mighty angel came down so we're
[47:41] in an open book age we're not in the
[47:43] closed book age we're in an open book
[47:45] age where god's not going to wink at our
[47:48] ignorance if we're baptized in the name
[47:49] of the father son holy ghost
[47:53] i was just reading an adoption series
[47:54] this morning where brother brown said
[47:56] absolute false doctrine
[47:58] was baptism in the name of father son
[48:00] holy ghost absolute false doctrine come
[48:02] from the pits of hell he said one time
[48:04] that's pretty tough
[48:06] well brother that's what jesus said
[48:08] jesus said in the name
[48:10] he didn't say names
[48:12] he said in the name
[48:14] what's my name samuel wade now i'm a
[48:16] person i'm a human i'm a postal employee
[48:20] but i'm one person
[48:22] and i don't sign postmaster on my checks
[48:25] i sign my name
[48:27] amen
[48:28] i i can't believe that the whole world
[48:30] and they are deceived by this and the
[48:32] bible tells us plainly that the whole
[48:35] family of god
[48:37] is named jesus christ
[48:39] that's what the bible tells us
[48:41] heaven and earth everything has got a
[48:43] name and it's the lord jesus christ and
[48:45] then we become baptized in titles which
[48:48] doesn't even put us in a family we're
[48:49] talking about family here all right
[48:52] talk about family
[48:55] all right let's go to galatians 4 let's
[48:56] real quick
[48:58] and we'll start with three stages of
[48:59] adoption everybody all right
[49:01] those of you that are awake
[49:04] oh thank you
[49:07] somebody punch and wake somebody up
[49:09] galatians 4 1. now i say that the heir
[49:12] as long as he's a child we covered it
[49:14] this morning just the background a
[49:15] minute difference nothing from a servant
[49:17] though it be lord of all listen
[49:21] what brother ernie always say our our
[49:23] attitude determines our altitude
[49:26] right think about that our attitude
[49:28] determines our altitude
[49:30] so if you take somebody that says
[49:32] well i'm a i'm a child of
[49:35] let's say
[49:36] the king of wherever let's say the king
[49:39] of england or
[49:40] or something like that and he stomps out
[49:42] when he's about four or five years old
[49:44] and he said i'm here to take over i'm
[49:46] gonna make all the decisions
[49:48] i'm gonna drive the car
[49:50] i'm gonna i'm gonna we're just going to
[49:53] war
[49:54] at five years old
[49:57] yet he was a son
[49:59] they couldn't deny he was in the realm
[50:01] of being the heir
[50:03] but i'm sure the daddy looked at him the
[50:05] one that was ruling at the moment i
[50:08] looked at him and said shut up son
[50:10] go back in there
[50:11] with the servants and bring me some
[50:13] coffee
[50:17] i am really glad that my daddy
[50:20] was not
[50:21] my boss in life
[50:23] working life
[50:26] because he said if i had a business he
[50:29] said my kids would start out cleaning
[50:30] toilets
[50:33] you know what he said
[50:34] that's what he said and he said it over
[50:36] and over and over
[50:38] he said i'd have them clean and toilets
[50:40] well that's what this is he was a son
[50:42] but he had to learn
[50:46] jesus learned by the things he suffered
[50:49] you're not going to learn by the things
[50:50] we suffered
[50:52] but but
[50:53] really i mean i did own a company for a
[50:56] while several years
[50:58] but i didn't start out as the owner
[51:02] i worked as a truck driver
[51:05] because i wanted to learn the business
[51:08] the ins and outs the ups and downs so
[51:09] for if a guy could come up to me that
[51:12] was driving the truck and he said look
[51:13] i'm having an xyz problem i don't know
[51:15] what he's talking about
[51:18] instead of going i'm the owner don't
[51:20] talk to me
[51:23] now how'd you like to have a box like
[51:24] that
[51:26] are you cleaning houses and somebody
[51:27] never cleaned the house that's like
[51:28] these people that write books about
[51:30] children and never had a child today of
[51:31] their life
[51:32] i cannot believe that i cannot believe
[51:34] you got all these people that are just
[51:37] they you they get on television and they
[51:39] got all that and everybody listens to
[51:40] them and you're going
[51:42] they ain't even married
[51:44] what are you talking to me about being
[51:45] married they ain't married
[51:47] we got to have somebody with experience
[51:50] i want somebody with experience i was
[51:51] reading brother brown yesterday he said
[51:53] he said look i don't want a surgeon that
[51:55] just come out of
[51:56] just come out of school
[51:58] you know
[52:00] to operate on me
[52:03] not the first operation
[52:06] you got to put me out a long time before
[52:08] this guy comes in the room
[52:11] but what about an old seasoned veteran
[52:14] that's who you want to work on you so an
[52:16] old seasoned veteran that if there is a
[52:18] problem he knows how to handle it well
[52:20] the same thing with god you start out as
[52:23] no different from a servant
[52:26] though you be lord of all though inside
[52:28] of you is the ability to become
[52:31] a a not a servant
[52:35] excuse me but somebody with authority
[52:39] authority is what we're looking at
[52:41] authority
[52:42] sure we want to just like what brother
[52:44] brown said he said
[52:46] when you get born again you know
[52:48] and you ought to remember this when you
[52:50] get born again
[52:51] well let me just tell you my appearance
[52:53] you get i got born again
[52:55] and for about six or eight months
[52:57] my daddy was so gracious not my natural
[53:00] daddy my spiritual daddy and whatever i
[53:02] asked he just laid it out there
[53:06] how many have you been through that
[53:09] but then about a year or so later
[53:14] somewhere
[53:15] the cable got cut
[53:18] and god went on vacation
[53:21] and we're like
[53:22] where you at daddy
[53:24] i need you just like i needed you six
[53:26] months ago you know what he says he
[53:27] calls down
[53:28] grow up
[53:30] i give you all your provisions that you
[53:33] need
[53:35] i sent you an apostle prophet to pastor
[53:37] teacher and evangelist i've sent you
[53:39] somebody that can help you with your
[53:41] issues
[53:42] why are you calling to me all the time
[53:46] amen well that's the way god same way
[53:48] god does but we're under tutors and
[53:51] governors
[53:52] teachers
[53:53] and governors until the time appointed
[53:55] to the father and then you know brother
[53:56] brown tells us
[53:58] he says sometimes
[54:00] he said the holy spirit will go to god
[54:02] and say
[54:03] this guy is a renegade
[54:07] he's just not doing everything you're
[54:09] supposed that he's supposed to do
[54:11] he's not like to chip off the old block
[54:14] he's wanting to do his own thing
[54:19] but now what does god do god doesn't say
[54:22] okay we're going to kick him out of the
[54:24] family
[54:25] no once you're in the family you're in
[54:27] the family for good
[54:32] but god wants you to grow up
[54:35] so he gives us tutors and governors
[54:37] trainers listen we've had 60 years since
[54:39] the prophet left
[54:41] 60 some odd years
[54:43] and what have we done with it
[54:45] we still babies
[54:47] we still have to it's not wrong to call
[54:49] you pastor but
[54:51] my word
[54:52] why bother him if the cat's sick
[54:58] put your hands on the cat yourself
[55:02] me and jim several times we had um
[55:05] cocker spaniels and they're notorious
[55:07] for hip dysplasia which means their hips
[55:08] go out of joint and they'll just flatten
[55:10] out on the floor
[55:12] and they'll start whimpering like a baby
[55:14] we just picked one up one time we just
[55:16] said we're not taking you to the vet
[55:18] we're praying right here
[55:19] all right honey
[55:20] laid our hands on that little black dog
[55:22] and all of a sudden
[55:24] gone
[55:26] she didn't have any other problems with
[55:27] it that i can remember
[55:29] but you don't have to call
[55:31] you take what's inside of you
[55:34] even just being a baby
[55:37] if you're able to know who to contact
[55:40] right it's who you know how to contact
[55:44] and how do you know that well we're
[55:45] reading right here in adoption number
[55:47] three we'll get to our point in just a
[55:48] second
[55:50] we talk about teaching teaching places a
[55:52] man positionally what he is
[55:54] listen it's like we were talking the
[55:56] other week it's really it's wonderful to
[55:59] have someone come in and get your
[56:01] emotion up
[56:02] because we are emotional people
[56:05] well some of us are
[56:07] some of us are not
[56:14] so we need that
[56:16] i think we all do
[56:18] okay
[56:20] but not all the time
[56:23] a balance
[56:25] bring in a good teacher bring in a good
[56:27] apostle a good i wish we could find a
[56:29] prophet
[56:30] like brother dale said always if we
[56:31] could find one we'd bring him in here
[56:33] some of y'all wouldn't come to church
[56:34] but
[56:39] remember he's got discernment
[56:43] think about that one a man laugh a
[56:45] little bit if you need to wake up a
[56:47] little bit
[56:48] but teaching places a man positionally
[56:50] what he is
[56:51] and we can never rightly be able to have
[56:53] faith
[56:55] think about that read that quote we are
[56:58] we can nev oh everybody believe brother
[56:59] brown was a prophet if we i just want to
[57:01] make sure y'all still got the same crowd
[57:03] here
[57:04] able to have faith until positionally we
[57:07] know what we are
[57:10] now being a son and daughter of god that
[57:12] is a position
[57:16] but you got to do the plus part
[57:19] the next position is is what we're going
[57:21] to talk about in just a little while is
[57:23] the placing
[57:24] we'll talk about that in just a second
[57:26] but teaching places a man positionally
[57:29] what he is and we can never rightly be
[57:31] able to have faith until positionally we
[57:32] know
[57:34] what we are
[57:35] all right so let's read number four and
[57:36] then we'll get started here
[57:38] everybody okay we got just about 30
[57:40] minutes we'll take communion in just a
[57:41] minute now what is adoption
[57:44] now let me get this now i don't know
[57:45] whether i won't have time to go through
[57:47] this but i'll hit it then there's a
[57:48] question you can ask me later in the
[57:50] message listen
[57:52] your adoption is not your birth
[57:55] i've read that over and over and over
[57:56] again so you ought to understand they're
[57:58] two distinct different things
[58:01] in your life of a christian journey all
[58:03] right
[58:04] your adoption is not your birth your
[58:05] adoption is your placing and we're going
[58:08] to talk about that in just a minute
[58:09] when you were born john 1 17 i believe
[58:12] when we are born of the spirit of god we
[58:13] are sons of god
[58:15] but
[58:16] we are predestinated what are we
[58:18] predestinated to adoption
[58:21] now that was me not the quote now here's
[58:23] what i'm trying to get
[58:25] get you to for this son of the sons of
[58:27] the last day that's us
[58:30] see we're predestinated unto adoption
[58:34] but yet look now here we are now this is
[58:37] what hurts pentecostals a little bit i
[58:38] got born again praise the lord got the
[58:40] holy ghost fine
[58:41] you're a child of god
[58:43] that's right but yet that ain't what i'm
[58:45] talking about see you're predestinated
[58:48] unto adoption adoption is placing a sun
[58:51] everybody got that say amen
[58:53] all right so now let's start wake up
[58:55] just a minute let's get this let's get
[58:56] this into this important part we were in
[58:58] a little bit of it the other day but
[59:01] let's jump in a little more so three
[59:03] stages of adoption first stage is the
[59:05] birth
[59:06] anybody okay with that
[59:08] you gotta have a birth so it is part of
[59:10] the it is part of the stages or
[59:13] dispensations or whatever you want to
[59:14] call it anointings because listen
[59:18] without being born again number one you
[59:20] can't enter the kingdom of god you can't
[59:23] understand the kingdom of god and listen
[59:26] god's not obligated to talk to you
[59:30] because he's not your daddy at that
[59:31] point
[59:33] he's not your daddy until you're born
[59:34] again
[59:35] now he's the father we know they're sons
[59:37] come on people
[59:40] but god protects his children
[59:43] not the devil's kids
[59:48] i thank god for that
[59:51] i you know
[59:52] we're different
[59:54] and that god wants to make us different
[59:56] not that we want to be segregationless
[59:58] as we were talking about the other day
[59:59] got to segregation list he said you
[1:00:01] don't get with that evil bunch over
[1:00:02] there you don't marry into that bunch of
[1:00:04] heathens over there you don't dabble
[1:00:06] around in the world i want you
[1:00:08] segregated or separated
[1:00:10] from that
[1:00:11] evil
[1:00:13] all right
[1:00:14] so let's get started for as many that
[1:00:16] are led by the spirit of god they are
[1:00:18] the sons of god that's pretty cut and
[1:00:20] dry
[1:00:23] most of us before we became led by the
[1:00:25] spirit of god we were led by a spirit
[1:00:29] god says we were led by spirit it wasn't
[1:00:32] holy
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:36] but we got rid of that one
[1:00:38] and we got a new one
[1:00:40] we got a new spirit a new creation a new
[1:00:43] you
[1:00:45] like brother brown said nothing oh you
[1:00:46] made over
[1:00:48] a new you
[1:00:50] a new person
[1:00:51] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:00:53] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:00:55] received the spirit of adoption
[1:00:58] whereby you cry
[1:00:59] father father abba father
[1:01:02] because listen because we're into the
[1:01:04] family we receive the spirit of adoption
[1:01:06] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[1:01:08] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:01:10] god all right here we are we're children
[1:01:12] we're children of god thereby children
[1:01:13] of god
[1:01:14] amen we are the children of god if
[1:01:17] you're not the children of god it's real
[1:01:18] simple give your heart to the lord
[1:01:21] give your heart to the lord all right
[1:01:23] it's real simple
[1:01:24] people make it too complicated
[1:01:27] and if children that's that word if the
[1:01:29] biggest word in the world
[1:01:31] and if children then heirs
[1:01:34] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:01:37] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:01:39] may be also glorified together and if
[1:01:42] children then heirs
[1:01:44] heirs of god and join heirs with christ
[1:01:47] so whatever he gets we get
[1:01:50] but there's still a time listen if if
[1:01:52] paul would have ended that
[1:01:56] that would have been it
[1:01:57] that would have been all we had to do if
[1:01:59] he would have ended that chapter and
[1:02:00] that was the end of the book of the
[1:02:01] bible that's all we had to do
[1:02:03] nope there's a lot more to that amen
[1:02:07] but let's talk about this for a minute
[1:02:08] this is your birth we know we've talked
[1:02:10] about be having heaven the new birth but
[1:02:12] we do not believe in this church that
[1:02:14] you got the new birth just because you
[1:02:15] believe this message
[1:02:18] the devil believes this message and he
[1:02:20] come to church for you did and he'll
[1:02:22] probably leave after you do
[1:02:24] well actually he'll probably leave with
[1:02:25] you
[1:02:32] joey don't bother you when you go home
[1:02:34] oh yeah that's what i thought okay
[1:02:36] so we we're talking about the same devil
[1:02:38] right okay let's talk about the same
[1:02:39] devil okay all right i thought maybe
[1:02:41] there was a different one that i only
[1:02:43] had that one
[1:02:45] but we come to church
[1:02:47] and we listen to the word of god
[1:02:50] and it's supposed to change us
[1:02:54] the old has been made new
[1:02:57] think about this
[1:02:59] you young people
[1:03:00] old people
[1:03:02] you did not get the new birth by just a
[1:03:05] thought
[1:03:09] it's not just a good thought
[1:03:11] or a good idea
[1:03:13] you know i met people in the message
[1:03:15] a long time ago
[1:03:18] that had the attitude that because they
[1:03:20] were in a message they had something
[1:03:21] different somebody else
[1:03:23] and they were better than somebody else
[1:03:25] see that's the wrong attitude right
[1:03:26] there
[1:03:28] that's the wrong attitude
[1:03:30] remember our ad our attitude determines
[1:03:32] our what altitude
[1:03:34] all right
[1:03:38] if you got born again
[1:03:40] and it made you arrogant you didn't get
[1:03:42] born again
[1:03:45] if it humbled you that god
[1:03:48] the creator would come down to you
[1:03:52] and change you because you asked him
[1:03:55] and you cried dad i need some help
[1:03:59] i want to be your child
[1:04:02] and you know what he says
[1:04:03] okay
[1:04:05] i've just been waiting all these years
[1:04:06] for you to say that
[1:04:08] and then he gives you the new birth and
[1:04:10] what does it do it changes you it
[1:04:12] changes the way you even think
[1:04:17] man if you still think i mean listen we
[1:04:19] still have those thoughts
[1:04:22] we can't help them
[1:04:24] i wish we could i wished our brain was
[1:04:25] born again not just our soul amen
[1:04:29] i do because that's the greatest battle
[1:04:30] that that's where that battle is is
[1:04:32] right here
[1:04:33] if you're born again there is not a
[1:04:34] battle in your soul
[1:04:36] there's not a battle in your heart of
[1:04:38] you not this thumping thing
[1:04:41] but if you're not born again you got a
[1:04:42] problem here and here
[1:04:46] but get this thing born again
[1:04:49] because in your spirit realm you're not
[1:04:51] memory reason conscious effects and
[1:04:52] imagination that is our problem
[1:04:57] the memory of what i did didn't get
[1:04:59] washed away when i got born again now
[1:05:01] listen it got washed away to him
[1:05:06] it got washed away to god
[1:05:08] because god said i'm going to forget
[1:05:09] them i can do that
[1:05:11] and i'm going to put them in a season
[1:05:12] deep you can't even find them and i
[1:05:14] can't even find them
[1:05:15] how many times do we worry about things
[1:05:17] we did and we say god forgive me and
[1:05:19] he's like
[1:05:20] what are you talking about
[1:05:22] what are you talking about why do we
[1:05:23] keep bringing them up
[1:05:25] if they're buried and dead don't dig the
[1:05:27] sucker up
[1:05:29] why would you want to dig a dead body up
[1:05:32] whoo
[1:05:33] stinketh
[1:05:35] that's what it is think but let it go
[1:05:40] i'm glad he don't remember him
[1:05:43] but our fight is the battle
[1:05:47] in our brain
[1:05:49] of our memory reason conscious affection
[1:05:51] and imagination
[1:05:54] so if you're born again today i'll
[1:05:56] promise you you're going to have trouble
[1:06:00] you're going to have trouble
[1:06:02] listen when i was a center it didn't
[1:06:03] bother me to go i didn't go to bars
[1:06:04] anyway much but it didn't bother me to
[1:06:06] go to a bar that made me put a beer in
[1:06:08] the refrigerator didn't bother me put a
[1:06:09] cigarette in my mouth which i never did
[1:06:11] smoke but it didn't bother me if i did
[1:06:13] because why there was something inside
[1:06:15] of me and said hey it's okay
[1:06:17] that old you was like ah it's okay
[1:06:19] you can curse that person out it's okay
[1:06:21] he deserved it
[1:06:26] right
[1:06:28] but now when that person curses at you
[1:06:30] what do you do you say god
[1:06:34] i used to be that way
[1:06:36] thank you for forgiving me now forgive
[1:06:37] him
[1:06:39] or her
[1:06:40] can we say that can we say and really
[1:06:42] mean it god
[1:06:43] jesus hanging on a cross stephen being
[1:06:46] stoned
[1:06:48] he said father
[1:06:51] don't let this be on them
[1:06:54] forgive them
[1:06:56] and i believe they did
[1:06:58] because you know who was standing there
[1:06:59] holding the coat when stephen got stoned
[1:07:02] mr saul
[1:07:04] or paul
[1:07:05] mr saul
[1:07:07] he was standing there holding the coats
[1:07:09] and he was
[1:07:11] participating not stoning but he was
[1:07:13] there participating but you know what
[1:07:17] that bothered paul
[1:07:19] all of his life
[1:07:22] because he was a human
[1:07:23] he knew he had put those christians to
[1:07:25] death
[1:07:26] he caused him to blaspheme
[1:07:28] and now god was going to use him though
[1:07:30] to open the door to the gentile church
[1:07:34] what am i saying doesn't matter what
[1:07:35] you've done folks
[1:07:38] and you say well i may have blasphemed
[1:07:39] the holy
[1:07:40] ghost if you have one desire in your
[1:07:43] heart
[1:07:45] one
[1:07:47] one desire in your heart to do better
[1:07:49] for god
[1:07:50] or want to want to have more of god you
[1:07:52] have not blasphemed
[1:07:54] when you blaspheme that's it
[1:07:57] you're done
[1:07:58] even if you did try like judas did
[1:08:02] and like uh jake esau did
[1:08:07] not going back
[1:08:09] and one day you'll just sear your
[1:08:11] conscious and you'll be just you'll be
[1:08:12] just
[1:08:13] worse than you were before
[1:08:16] but let's talk about this just for a
[1:08:17] minute let's read second peter 1 verse
[1:08:19] 1.
[1:08:21] everybody all right
[1:08:24] simon peter servant the apostle of jesus
[1:08:26] christ look to them that what have what
[1:08:30] oh i'm sorry not upset yet
[1:08:37] thank you
[1:08:38] thank you peter
[1:08:39] i believe i leave i was driving a car
[1:08:41] today
[1:08:47] hey listen
[1:08:48] we've got some young kids that know how
[1:08:50] to do stuff back then that in that in
[1:08:52] that uh room back there and we've got
[1:08:54] some really good brothers that are
[1:08:55] training them too and with this new
[1:08:57] system it's totally different
[1:08:59] than what they've done before so just
[1:09:00] bear with them and we all do
[1:09:03] just hurry up a servant an apostle
[1:09:08] that was the devil said that i'm sorry i
[1:09:11] apologize
[1:09:13] yeah that's right
[1:09:14] i'm just human
[1:09:16] look but look to them that have what
[1:09:18] obtained
[1:09:20] obtained like precious faith
[1:09:22] now this is the part where we
[1:09:25] we were talking about the other day
[1:09:26] where you've got a side over here that
[1:09:28] that preaches that that you don't get
[1:09:30] anything until you that you got to get
[1:09:32] all these virtues and then god gives you
[1:09:34] the holy spirit okay according to this
[1:09:36] chart we're looking at
[1:09:38] and then we've got another group of
[1:09:39] people in the message that says you got
[1:09:41] it all when you believe you don't need
[1:09:42] anything else just sit back and relax
[1:09:46] they're both wrong but they both do have
[1:09:49] some truth
[1:09:50] but look but you to them that have
[1:09:52] obtained
[1:09:54] light precious faith with us
[1:09:57] peter was born again
[1:10:00] all right through the righteousness of
[1:10:02] god and our savior jesus christ grace
[1:10:04] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[1:10:05] the knowledge of god in our lord jesus
[1:10:07] our lord
[1:10:09] according as his divine nature
[1:10:13] divine power
[1:10:16] has given us all things that pertain to
[1:10:18] life and godliness
[1:10:20] wow
[1:10:21] even in our life
[1:10:22] our natural life and our spiritual life
[1:10:25] through the knowledge of him that has
[1:10:26] called us to glory and virtue now watch
[1:10:31] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:10:33] great and precious promises
[1:10:35] that by these the prophet said these
[1:10:37] promises you might be partakers of the
[1:10:39] divine look how that word divine
[1:10:42] divine nature
[1:10:43] divine power he's talking about the new
[1:10:46] birth
[1:10:47] before you go up to pyramid
[1:10:51] how you gonna get all these listen how
[1:10:53] are you gonna get the nature of god if
[1:10:54] you ain't got a part of him in you
[1:10:55] anyway
[1:10:56] no way
[1:10:59] we've got a nature all right if we don't
[1:11:00] have a nature of god but it ain't of god
[1:11:04] look having escaped the corruption that
[1:11:06] is in the world through us and besides
[1:11:08] this giving all diligence add
[1:11:11] everybody with me
[1:11:13] ad
[1:11:14] besides this in other words what besides
[1:11:17] having the new birth
[1:11:20] add this to it
[1:11:24] is that crazy no it sounds exactly the
[1:11:27] way i read it
[1:11:28] and besides getting all this giving all
[1:11:30] dylan just add to your faith virtually
[1:11:31] your virtual knowledge you got to get
[1:11:33] the divine nature of god before you can
[1:11:36] decide whether that nature that's coming
[1:11:38] in you is divine or not because listen
[1:11:40] some of these virtues
[1:11:43] are just man-given
[1:11:46] they some people that do not have a
[1:11:48] temper
[1:11:49] hadn't met many of them yet
[1:11:52] because remember well
[1:11:55] remember my spirit irritates their
[1:11:56] demons so
[1:11:57] anyway
[1:11:59] and besides this giving all dylan just
[1:12:01] add so there's the ad there's the new
[1:12:04] birth
[1:12:05] everybody okay with that
[1:12:07] now acts 2 38 well here we go let's read
[1:12:10] this then peter said unto them repent
[1:12:13] that's our problem we're wanting people
[1:12:15] to get baptized we want to throw them in
[1:12:16] the water
[1:12:17] let's get them repented first
[1:12:21] repent
[1:12:24] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:12:25] name of jesus i'm sorry i'm loud i'm
[1:12:27] sorry
[1:12:28] where's some ear plug
[1:12:31] maybe baptize every one of you name of
[1:12:33] the father and of the son
[1:12:35] oh
[1:12:36] now wait a minute this is peter right
[1:12:39] this is peter
[1:12:41] didn't peter when jesus was there didn't
[1:12:43] peter say all right peter said i'm gonna
[1:12:44] give you a key
[1:12:48] i'm gonna give you a key
[1:12:51] and whatever you lock on earth
[1:12:54] i'll lock it in heaven
[1:12:56] whatever you loose on earth i'm gonna
[1:12:58] loose it in heaven so why in the world
[1:13:00] would on the day of pentecost he's
[1:13:01] getting ready to loose the holy ghost
[1:13:03] onto the world
[1:13:08] and him tell them to baptize in the name
[1:13:10] of jesus christ
[1:13:14] oh peter wait a minute you were standing
[1:13:16] there jesus told you baptized in the
[1:13:18] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:13:19] the holy ghost well that's exactly what
[1:13:21] is happening
[1:13:23] because the name of the father and of
[1:13:24] the son and the holy ghost who is jesus
[1:13:27] christ
[1:13:29] and that puts you in the
[1:13:30] family repent and be baptized every one
[1:13:33] of you in the name of jesus christ for
[1:13:34] the remission of sins and you shall what
[1:13:36] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:13:38] for the promise
[1:13:41] isn't to you
[1:13:43] and to your children
[1:13:44] and to all that are far off and even as
[1:13:46] many as the lord our god
[1:13:49] shall call
[1:13:50] repent
[1:13:51] and be baptized and ye shall receive the
[1:13:54] gift
[1:13:55] of the holy ghost
[1:13:58] wow
[1:13:59] that's pretty stout
[1:14:02] but guess what
[1:14:04] that's your new birth
[1:14:05] let's go to number five read this one
[1:14:07] real quick
[1:14:10] an adoption series watch this
[1:14:12] in this promised land
[1:14:14] and i want to kind of slow down just for
[1:14:16] a second i'm sorry
[1:14:18] in this promised land everything belongs
[1:14:21] to us in the promised land now what did
[1:14:23] i just tell you the promise was
[1:14:25] the new
[1:14:26] birth right i just told you the promise
[1:14:29] is to you
[1:14:30] it's the promise of the holy ghost
[1:14:32] not just to be an anointing but to live
[1:14:34] inside of you and make you a child son
[1:14:35] and daughter of god
[1:14:37] all right
[1:14:38] in this promised land everything belongs
[1:14:41] to us in the promised land now look
[1:14:43] potentially
[1:14:45] everybody with me
[1:14:46] potentially israel
[1:14:49] possessed that land of canaan
[1:14:51] potentially because god give it to him
[1:14:54] god said abraham wherever your soul your
[1:14:56] feet is that's where you're going to
[1:14:58] possess
[1:14:59] but they got driven out of that land
[1:15:01] because of what disobedience
[1:15:05] idol worshipers
[1:15:08] they didn't stay with the one true god
[1:15:09] so god drove them out of the land
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:15] but it was theirs
[1:15:18] god said you're going to be out of that
[1:15:19] land for 400 years
[1:15:22] 400 years remember he told them
[1:15:24] but i'll bring you out with a mighty ham
[1:15:26] because you know what i give you that
[1:15:28] lead i told abraham wherever his feet
[1:15:31] landed that was your possession
[1:15:33] wherever you walk that's why footsteps
[1:15:36] means possession that's why we've walked
[1:15:38] all over this world and we've possessed
[1:15:40] this earth because being the bride of
[1:15:42] jesus christ
[1:15:44] we own this place
[1:15:51] here's a shocker
[1:15:52] we're going to live here for an eternity
[1:15:53] too
[1:15:55] we're not going to live on no cloud
[1:15:59] how boring would that be
[1:16:01] no we're going to live on earth because
[1:16:02] we were actually abraham adam was what
[1:16:05] god of the earth
[1:16:07] we're coming back to what full
[1:16:08] redemption god
[1:16:10] in me and you
[1:16:11] we own this earth he give it to us
[1:16:14] so look see brother collins see
[1:16:16] everything in the promised land when
[1:16:17] israel crossed over this jordan into the
[1:16:20] promised land fought down everything now
[1:16:23] he stopped now watch now remember in
[1:16:25] this promised land that don't mean you
[1:16:27] are immune from sickness
[1:16:31] you say oh see that's where the
[1:16:32] pentecostals failed they said oh we got
[1:16:33] the holy ghost we speak in tongues we're
[1:16:35] among angels
[1:16:37] everything is hunky-dory
[1:16:39] if you don't know what hunky-dory is
[1:16:41] google it
[1:16:43] in this promised land that don't mean
[1:16:45] you're immune from sickness that don't
[1:16:46] mean you're immune from trouble
[1:16:48] but it does spell this oh let it sink
[1:16:51] deep
[1:16:52] it's yours
[1:16:55] just rise up
[1:16:57] and take it
[1:16:59] wow
[1:17:00] rise up
[1:17:02] and take it
[1:17:05] all right let's go to number six we'll
[1:17:06] get back to the promised land in just a
[1:17:08] minute
[1:17:09] questions and answers 1961.
[1:17:12] let's just read the red the promise is
[1:17:14] the promise is the baptism of the holy
[1:17:16] of the spirit which is promised all
[1:17:18] through the old testament do you all
[1:17:19] know that it was promised in the old
[1:17:20] testament
[1:17:22] sure it was
[1:17:25] and knew too see the promise behold i
[1:17:27] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:17:29] peter said that on the day of pentecost
[1:17:31] that's what joel said right
[1:17:34] it is hot in here y'all were fanning
[1:17:35] this
[1:17:37] without warm
[1:17:39] that is the promise the promised land is
[1:17:42] to live in this land of the holy spirit
[1:17:45] that's god's promise for the church
[1:17:47] is to live in the power
[1:17:50] of the spirit
[1:17:51] wow it's another
[1:17:54] world
[1:17:56] wow it's another
[1:17:59] land
[1:18:01] you have to come out of the conditions
[1:18:03] that you've been in to come out to live
[1:18:06] in this promised land to receive
[1:18:09] the promise
[1:18:10] remember the promise you shall receive
[1:18:12] power from on high after this the holy
[1:18:14] ghost has come upon you and peter said
[1:18:16] that the promise that was made all down
[1:18:17] through the testament old and new you
[1:18:19] find promising on up on up to that day
[1:18:22] of pentecost and then they entered into
[1:18:24] that
[1:18:25] promise let's go to number seven
[1:18:28] adoption
[1:18:29] 1960
[1:18:34] look now that son is going to be the
[1:18:35] heir of everything that he's got he's an
[1:18:37] heir but i'll watch
[1:18:38] and when we are born in the kingdom of
[1:18:40] god by jesus christ we're an heir of
[1:18:42] heaven
[1:18:43] joy heirs with jesus because he took our
[1:18:45] place
[1:18:46] he became us that we might become him
[1:18:49] he became me that i might become him
[1:18:51] join heirs with him all right now
[1:18:52] remember that's to each one of you now
[1:18:55] remember
[1:18:56] god predestinated you by foreknowledge
[1:19:00] anybody okay with that
[1:19:02] that you were coming to this
[1:19:05] to what
[1:19:07] adoption
[1:19:10] you gotta get born again first
[1:19:11] then you come to this
[1:19:13] everybody understand it raise your hand
[1:19:16] god by foreknowledge predestinated you
[1:19:19] to come to the promised land what is the
[1:19:21] promised land for the christian today
[1:19:23] just raise his hand your hand if you
[1:19:25] know it the promise is unto you and your
[1:19:26] children what the promise of the holy
[1:19:28] ghost
[1:19:30] all right so the baptism of the holy
[1:19:32] ghost puts you as an air it puts you in
[1:19:35] the will
[1:19:40] right
[1:19:42] puts you in the will because remember
[1:19:45] if you're not in the well why do you
[1:19:47] need to go to the court why you're not
[1:19:49] gonna get anything
[1:19:54] but once you get into the will
[1:19:57] of the bible then there's all your
[1:19:59] promises
[1:20:00] now it's the promise when you get into
[1:20:02] that land it's a promise that you can be
[1:20:05] positionally placed and that's what
[1:20:06] we're going to talk about just for a few
[1:20:08] minutes
[1:20:10] let's go to the second stage placing or
[1:20:12] adoption
[1:20:14] now here is romans 8. we read romans 8
[1:20:19] 14-17 all right so now we're on verse
[1:20:22] 18. so it just i just broke these apart
[1:20:25] now watch for i reckon that the
[1:20:26] suffering of this present time are not
[1:20:28] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:20:30] which shall be revealed in jesus
[1:20:35] for those of you there to wait that
[1:20:37] doesn't say
[1:20:38] jesus
[1:20:41] that says us
[1:20:43] revealed in us
[1:20:47] now we're heirs and joiners at the new
[1:20:49] birth that's what should be revealed to
[1:20:51] you i am a child of god
[1:20:54] now that i am a child of god and i'm in
[1:20:56] the will when when the when the testator
[1:20:59] died he wrote a will
[1:21:03] jesus died you can't have a testament
[1:21:06] without the death of a testator that's
[1:21:08] what the bible says so jesus christ had
[1:21:10] to die to give you a will every sunday
[1:21:12] you walk in church god is reading you
[1:21:15] the will
[1:21:16] he's telling you what you got
[1:21:21] that was weak
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:28] he's telling you what you got but now
[1:21:30] listen if you're not born again
[1:21:33] number one you probably won't be in
[1:21:34] church so you won't hear the reading of
[1:21:35] the well
[1:21:37] but because you're in the family you get
[1:21:39] every bit of this
[1:21:41] this is your will his will is his what
[1:21:43] his word
[1:21:45] so you come every sunday to listen to
[1:21:47] the reading of the will now the reading
[1:21:49] of the will doesn't just say you're born
[1:21:51] again that's it stay a baby
[1:21:55] i don't want to use you
[1:21:58] i don't want to be revealed in you
[1:22:02] that's not what god said
[1:22:04] totally opposite
[1:22:06] he said i want to be revealed in you and
[1:22:08] through you i want you to have every
[1:22:11] promise in the book
[1:22:13] every promise in the book is mine
[1:22:16] every chapter every verse every line
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:22] so let's go a little bit more
[1:22:24] second stage for the earnest expectation
[1:22:27] watch this of the creature
[1:22:30] now that word is translated also to
[1:22:33] creation
[1:22:34] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:22:36] creature
[1:22:37] waiteth
[1:22:38] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:22:42] watch for the creature was made subject
[1:22:44] to vanity
[1:22:46] not willingly
[1:22:52] if you don't understand what that is
[1:22:54] watch for the earnest expectation of the
[1:22:56] creation waited for the manifestation of
[1:22:57] the sons of god for the creation was
[1:22:59] made subject to vanity
[1:23:02] in the garden of eden before the fall
[1:23:04] the world was created perfect
[1:23:08] right
[1:23:09] but because of one little thing that
[1:23:11] happened
[1:23:13] everybody got it
[1:23:15] you're made subject to vanity
[1:23:17] not willingly
[1:23:21] but by reason of him who has subjected
[1:23:23] the same in hope
[1:23:25] in other words christ had to come to
[1:23:26] bring us back to that
[1:23:28] because the creature itself also shall
[1:23:31] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:23:32] corruption and to the glorious liberty
[1:23:34] of the children of god for we know that
[1:23:37] the whole creation look groaneth and
[1:23:39] travail us in pain together until when
[1:23:42] now
[1:23:44] until right now everybody okay with that
[1:23:48] now this is the placing or adoption this
[1:23:50] is not your new birth this is after
[1:23:51] you're born again you've come into the
[1:23:54] family of god you start reading the will
[1:23:58] to see what god's give you
[1:24:00] and you come to church and you listen to
[1:24:02] a preacher
[1:24:03] teach you
[1:24:04] how to read the word of god
[1:24:07] whoa
[1:24:08] bro wait i'm gonna read that for myself
[1:24:10] i can go to the house and read that
[1:24:13] yeah you being just as confused as the
[1:24:16] rest of the world
[1:24:23] that's why we come to church folks
[1:24:24] that's what we come we come to know that
[1:24:26] the right will
[1:24:28] is being read
[1:24:29] and that when i get what i get is right
[1:24:32] here in the bible
[1:24:33] and you open up to anywhere
[1:24:36] daniel hosea i'm sitting here reading
[1:24:37] now you look at all the even in the old
[1:24:39] testament you've got
[1:24:41] you've got promises from listen the
[1:24:43] greatest promise is genesis 1 26
[1:24:47] god's going to have a family
[1:24:49] he's going to create himself a family
[1:24:52] but what's going to happen is is when
[1:24:54] satan stopped the son and daughter of
[1:24:55] god from being born in the garden of
[1:24:56] eden
[1:24:58] god just said okay that's fine i'm still
[1:25:00] going to bring my children
[1:25:02] i'm just going to do it a couple
[1:25:03] thousand years later i'm going to come
[1:25:04] down here and do it myself
[1:25:06] because adam failed
[1:25:10] but this second adam will not fail
[1:25:13] and what did the second adam why did he
[1:25:15] not fall for he not he didn't fall for
[1:25:17] satan's life
[1:25:20] and he had me and you inside of him
[1:25:22] so he had to get us out all right so
[1:25:24] let's read this real quick now we're
[1:25:26] going to come to the stage of adoption
[1:25:28] of placing
[1:25:30] listen to this believer's position in
[1:25:31] christ number eight
[1:25:34] we'll read this real quick and then
[1:25:35] we'll get ready to take communion in a
[1:25:37] minute now in the spiritual sense after
[1:25:39] we were born in christ look after
[1:25:43] we were born in christ we became
[1:25:44] children of god but then see god knows
[1:25:47] best now here's what i say reverently
[1:25:49] disagree with my latter reign brethren
[1:25:51] you think i'm persecuting the church no
[1:25:54] my dear brother no no this boy after he
[1:25:57] got a certain age he had to be adopted
[1:25:59] into the same family he was born into
[1:26:02] ah
[1:26:03] so now we've come to the second stage
[1:26:05] not just that he's born into the family
[1:26:07] but he's got to be adopted
[1:26:11] into the same family he was born into
[1:26:14] any minister knows that's the placing of
[1:26:17] a son he had to be adopted into the
[1:26:19] family that he was born into could you
[1:26:21] imagine that but see that's the old
[1:26:23] testament teaching we see that but paul
[1:26:26] referred to it back in the book of
[1:26:28] ephesians so let's go to number nine
[1:26:30] the believer the position of a believer
[1:26:32] in 1955. this is in 1955 brother brown
[1:26:35] was talking about this
[1:26:37] now watch
[1:26:38] and now this epistle the letters of the
[1:26:40] ephesians
[1:26:41] was written
[1:26:42] to believers not to the outside world
[1:26:47] all right this is believers that's why i
[1:26:49] thought this afternoon first i'd test
[1:26:51] and see if there's a group
[1:26:53] yeah i giggled when i saw this
[1:26:55] i thought this afternoon first i'd test
[1:26:58] and see if there's a group of
[1:26:59] unbelievers i didn't do that okay i'm
[1:27:00] sorry
[1:27:02] and sinners then i couldn't speak this
[1:27:04] here
[1:27:06] but now seeing that it is for believers
[1:27:08] and the believers are present
[1:27:11] i thought it would be good if we let the
[1:27:13] believers see where he is
[1:27:16] are we that place now
[1:27:19] now try hard christians to understand
[1:27:21] that this day
[1:27:22] the message has been placing the
[1:27:24] believers and positionally placed
[1:27:27] if every believer in here was in their
[1:27:30] place
[1:27:32] everybody wake up just a minute
[1:27:34] if every believer in here was in their
[1:27:36] place well
[1:27:38] i'm so thankful that where the whole
[1:27:40] rows of wheelchairs set there's only
[1:27:42] about two or three left in here he had a
[1:27:44] prayer service before
[1:27:45] the night before if every believer knew
[1:27:48] their place a lady on the cot man with
[1:27:50] the crutches
[1:27:51] there would not be a feeble person in
[1:27:53] this building
[1:27:55] in the next 20 minutes
[1:27:58] i'm just everybody still believed
[1:27:59] brother branham was a prophet we believe
[1:28:01] what he said okay all right
[1:28:03] that's right if every man could simply
[1:28:06] find his place his or her sister that's
[1:28:09] you too
[1:28:10] in christ jesus what a difference it
[1:28:12] would make
[1:28:13] now i know
[1:28:15] he's discerning i feel your mind rolling
[1:28:17] fast now brother brown i know where i am
[1:28:19] you think you do
[1:28:21] if you do it'd be different
[1:28:25] let me read that one more time
[1:28:27] now i know
[1:28:29] filled your mind that means he was
[1:28:31] discerning their mind
[1:28:33] somebody thought now brother branham i
[1:28:35] know where i'm at
[1:28:38] he said you think you do see that's it
[1:28:40] if you did
[1:28:41] it would be different
[1:28:44] can i say that to lewis church
[1:28:47] if you did know your position
[1:28:49] it'd be different
[1:28:52] now let's read number 10 a hidden life
[1:28:53] in christ that one hurt too much i'll
[1:28:55] move on
[1:28:57] now after this child become of age now
[1:28:59] look he's still a child
[1:29:01] but if the child was reckless
[1:29:04] and never paid any attention and wasn't
[1:29:06] so interested in the father's work
[1:29:08] that child never become adopted to that
[1:29:11] family
[1:29:12] but if he was a correct child
[1:29:14] a good child and loved the work of his
[1:29:17] father and was interested
[1:29:20] that's kind of strange for you all today
[1:29:21] to be interested in what's being said
[1:29:24] and tried to do all he could do to
[1:29:27] progress look not his work
[1:29:31] not his work
[1:29:33] the father's work
[1:29:35] listen
[1:29:37] my father wrote the well
[1:29:40] i'm supposed to manifest him not me
[1:29:44] then the tudor brought that word to the
[1:29:45] father and there was what's called the
[1:29:47] placing of the son or as paul give us in
[1:29:49] galatians the adoption that we were
[1:29:51] predestinated into the adoption of
[1:29:54] children by jesus christ the adoption
[1:29:56] now what look now the same son that was
[1:29:58] born into a family could be adopted into
[1:30:01] the same family or placed in the same
[1:30:03] family or give a position in the family
[1:30:06] that he was born into
[1:30:08] all right so that's that's separated you
[1:30:09] got born again over here then you've got
[1:30:11] positionally placed in the body or in
[1:30:14] the family of god and i do believe that
[1:30:16] that is the work of the holy spirit
[1:30:18] today among the church
[1:30:20] is trying to place in the church
[1:30:23] positionally apostles teachers prophets
[1:30:25] and so forth as we've seen many false
[1:30:27] alarms
[1:30:31] and so forth moving amongst the people
[1:30:34] which only indicated that the real
[1:30:36] genuine adoption was at hand
[1:30:41] i believe it
[1:30:43] god has to place into the church that's
[1:30:45] the business of god
[1:30:47] not of man
[1:30:49] let's go to hear you him 1960.
[1:30:54] we'll read this one and
[1:30:57] it may stop right there
[1:31:00] here you have 1960. then how the father
[1:31:03] says you're proud of that son
[1:31:05] you know what happens when he's getting
[1:31:07] his
[1:31:08] schooling his training yet he might not
[1:31:10] be able to exercise all authority
[1:31:13] he hasn't got it yet
[1:31:14] he's still a son but he hasn't been
[1:31:16] placed now you ministers know where i'm
[1:31:18] what i'm getting to it placing of a son
[1:31:20] now look
[1:31:21] if that son proved to be a right kind of
[1:31:23] son loved the father's business stayed
[1:31:25] right with his instructions
[1:31:27] the father then on a certain day took
[1:31:29] that son out before the public set him
[1:31:31] up on a high place clothed him in a
[1:31:33] beautiful garment and had what they call
[1:31:34] the adoption of a son or placing a son
[1:31:37] positionally what he was
[1:31:39] they had a ceremony and then the father
[1:31:41] said this is my son i adopt him or place
[1:31:43] them positionally
[1:31:44] and if they had checks in those days
[1:31:46] that son's name on the check was just as
[1:31:48] good as the father's name because look
[1:31:50] because he was placed
[1:31:52] the son could fire who he wanted to he
[1:31:55] could hire who he wanted to
[1:31:58] he was in full possession of all
[1:32:01] the father
[1:32:03] had
[1:32:05] full
[1:32:06] possession
[1:32:08] now listen to this
[1:32:10] because we're going to get back to
[1:32:11] placing because we got to go into joshua
[1:32:15] and placing the people in in the land
[1:32:17] here you have listen to this one real
[1:32:18] quick
[1:32:20] then we'll get ready to take communion
[1:32:26] number 11.
[1:32:28] oh wait that's two number 11 i'm sorry
[1:32:31] okay
[1:32:32] uh well this is e38 so it's a
[1:32:34] continuation just keep scrolling it
[1:32:37] there we go
[1:32:38] placing of a sun take him out in a
[1:32:39] certain place have a ceremony before
[1:32:41] angels
[1:32:42] and place him positionally what he is in
[1:32:44] the body of christ then that person has
[1:32:46] the authority let me say this if you
[1:32:48] count me a fanatic from this not on
[1:32:51] that very same thing that i'm speaking
[1:32:53] of will be done
[1:32:56] there's a power put into the church and
[1:32:58] now it's coming in that the holy spirit
[1:33:01] will so anoint the people
[1:33:03] till they'll speak the word and it'll
[1:33:05] create
[1:33:07] right there
[1:33:10] we haven't seen powers like that coming
[1:33:12] into the church now i know it for a fact
[1:33:15] say unto this mountain be move don't
[1:33:17] doubt in your heart but believe what
[1:33:18] you've said you shall shall come to pass
[1:33:21] you can have what you have said the
[1:33:22] placing of the church in position where
[1:33:24] the fullness of the power of the holy
[1:33:26] ghost comes into the church
[1:33:29] then critics mouths will be shut
[1:33:31] it'll be a short time
[1:33:33] jesus came right off the mountain went
[1:33:35] straight to calvary notice it won't last
[1:33:37] long
[1:33:38] but it'll be here
[1:33:40] wow we still believe brother brown was
[1:33:42] the problem
[1:33:44] okay
[1:33:46] now watch this real quick number 12
[1:33:48] we'll read these next three and then
[1:33:49] we'll be then we'll be done
[1:33:51] how many likes to study the book of
[1:33:53] galatians oh i mean ephesians he was in
[1:33:55] ephesians

[1:33:57] into the seal next sunday we're going
[1:33:59] into the positionally place in the
[1:34:00] church
[1:34:01] we'll probably get into it let's queue
[1:34:03] them down god has adopted us unto the
[1:34:05] sons
[1:34:06] and unto the sons we are sons by birth
[1:34:08] adopted positionally placed by the holy
[1:34:10] spirit
[1:34:12] look
[1:34:13] they were everyone hebrews when they
[1:34:14] crossed the river
[1:34:16] everybody okay with that they were the
[1:34:18] children of israel
[1:34:20] when they come to the river
[1:34:22] you're a child of god when you come to
[1:34:25] the river
[1:34:26] when they cross the river but look
[1:34:28] joshua divided the land and give each
[1:34:30] one
[1:34:31] his land according to the utterance of
[1:34:33] his mother at the birth where the holy
[1:34:36] spirit told her
[1:34:39] i talked about we talked about last
[1:34:41] night we'll get into it later on now
[1:34:43] watch let's go to number 13 1962. now we
[1:34:46] find that when joshua divided the
[1:34:48] inheritance to the people each person
[1:34:50] was placed positionally exactly the way
[1:34:53] these hebrew mothers named those
[1:34:55] children how they were placed in
[1:34:57] palestine just at their place asher gad
[1:34:59] not thali and each one judah everyone
[1:35:02] just placed in their position what a
[1:35:04] wonderful picture it gets us because
[1:35:06] it's a type of god what placing in the
[1:35:08] church
[1:35:09] himself every member every stone every
[1:35:11] place every christian to itself
[1:35:13] each one of us in our peculiar
[1:35:16] thank the lord
[1:35:19] all of us peculiar people say
[1:35:21] hallelujah
[1:35:24] each one of us in our peculiar way has a
[1:35:27] place in the house of god
[1:35:31] like solomon's temple when it was cut
[1:35:33] out all over the world you know that he
[1:35:35] ever studied the solomon's temple the
[1:35:37] bible said there was no hammer
[1:35:42] no sound of a hammer
[1:35:44] no sound of a saw
[1:35:47] brother gary
[1:35:49] can't happen
[1:35:53] he's got about four saws in his truck
[1:35:56] why because we need that but what
[1:35:58] happened was that was so
[1:35:59] perfect that god gave them the
[1:36:01] measurements and they cut them while
[1:36:03] they were out there in the field
[1:36:06] and they didn't miss it by none
[1:36:09] when they brought it to the temple it
[1:36:10] was just like a jigsaw puzzle they just
[1:36:12] put that thing together just like this
[1:36:13] and was not a sound of a hammer that was
[1:36:15] not a sound of a saw
[1:36:18] same thing with me and you now watch
[1:36:21] each one in a peculiar way all right we
[1:36:24] are ready let's go to verse let's go to
[1:36:26] number 14. this would be the last one
[1:36:29] get ready for communion i want to make a
[1:36:31] few comments for a second but he had to
[1:36:33] divide the lands and there was 12 tribes
[1:36:35] to divide it by now what if he had
[1:36:38] had some picks and pets
[1:36:41] what if he liked the tribe of god better
[1:36:43] than he liked the tribe of ephraim the
[1:36:45] tribe of joseph better than he did judah
[1:36:48] but he didn't do it that way he divided
[1:36:50] it according to the word revealed by the
[1:36:52] spirit he divided it according to tribes
[1:36:54] and notice he done it by the revelation
[1:36:56] by discernment
[1:36:58] by the discernment of god's spirit he
[1:37:00] did it each one of those hebrew mothers
[1:37:03] giving birth to those babies call their
[1:37:05] name and each one of their name has a
[1:37:07] meaning
[1:37:08] so every time those now remember like i
[1:37:10] said before you've got leah you've got
[1:37:12] leah you've got rachel and you've got
[1:37:14] some concubines mixed into all that to
[1:37:16] have all the 12
[1:37:18] to 12 children but every time they were
[1:37:20] in labor pains and they screamed out
[1:37:22] reuben or gad
[1:37:24] god positionally placed them
[1:37:27] spiritually and then then who joshua had
[1:37:30] to discern by the spirit where to put
[1:37:33] them
[1:37:34] and why in the world
[1:37:37] did he
[1:37:39] it wasn't just coincidence
[1:37:42] that the two tribes once said hey we'll
[1:37:44] just stay over here on this side
[1:37:46] and half the tribal manasseh said we're
[1:37:48] going to stay on this side but now what
[1:37:50] we'll do is though we'll go into the
[1:37:52] land and help our brothers fight right
[1:37:56] but this is a lot of there's a lot of
[1:37:57] green grass out here for our cows
[1:37:59] there's a lot of stuff on this side that
[1:38:01] we'll keep and he took a prophet of god
[1:38:04] thank god for a prophet
[1:38:05] where brother brown said oh we know what
[1:38:07] that is
[1:38:09] that's the two tribes and the half tribe
[1:38:10] of manassas that's justification
[1:38:12] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:38:14] ghost
[1:38:16] because
[1:38:18] listen
[1:38:19] that type luther wesley and pentecost
[1:38:22] they couldn't come to adoption
[1:38:25] come on people
[1:38:26] they couldn't come to placing
[1:38:29] wasn't required
[1:38:32] right in that dispensation
[1:38:34] but there was a half tribe of manasseh
[1:38:36] that was right over the border
[1:38:39] that connected to that other half tribal
[1:38:41] manasseh showing that the holy ghost was
[1:38:43] going to take us on into the land
[1:38:46] and then positionally place everybody
[1:38:48] there
[1:38:49] oh god thank god he sent us a prophet to
[1:38:51] be able to tell us that and then we look
[1:38:53] at that and say like hattie wright did
[1:38:55] that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:39:02] luther and wesley
[1:39:03] and pentecost couldn't come to adoption
[1:39:06] they didn't have enough word to get them
[1:39:07] to adoption they ran this land but they
[1:39:11] couldn't go over into the promised land
[1:39:16] that half tribe of manasseh though went
[1:39:17] across the promised land and was able to
[1:39:20] connect back to the pentecostals and
[1:39:23] then the prophet of god
[1:39:25] the holy ghost brought them across the
[1:39:27] land and positionally placed them
[1:39:29] in the land and we'll talk about that
[1:39:30] when we when we get started next time
[1:39:32] let's let's stand to our feet and
[1:39:39] there's just a lot to adoption and
[1:39:41] placing i wanted to just kind of go
[1:39:42] through it but the lord i think this
[1:39:43] morning kind of backed me up a little
[1:39:45] bit and said no
[1:39:48] you need to talk about the placing
[1:39:50] because that's important
[1:39:52] now i want to ask you a question
[1:39:54] do you know
[1:39:56] your
[1:39:57] place
[1:40:01] do you know your position in god
[1:40:04] if you're born again it's required
[1:40:07] that you know your position
[1:40:08] because if the if the in type if the
[1:40:10] hebrew children that were born
[1:40:13] born
[1:40:14] from their mother church
[1:40:17] born again
[1:40:19] if you get born again
[1:40:21] somewhere down the line
[1:40:23] you've got to know where your place is
[1:40:28] and the problem is and we'll read it
[1:40:30] next week where we had manasseh
[1:40:33] or gad trying to put a little corn in
[1:40:38] in reuben's corn in reuben's field
[1:40:41] nope reuben had a position
[1:40:43] stay out of that
[1:40:47] i know i'm not a prophet i'm not going
[1:40:49] to try to be one
[1:40:50] but i am i believe in minister of the
[1:40:52] gospel so should you you should know
[1:40:53] where your position is at what you're
[1:40:55] doing
[1:40:56] you should know when you walk in the
[1:40:57] door and not be able not be not be what
[1:41:00] tossed about with every wind of doctrine
[1:41:02] amen because listen satan is here
[1:41:05] to do that
[1:41:07] he will do it
[1:41:10] that's his job
[1:41:12] but you know what it's god's job to
[1:41:14] protect his children
[1:41:16] and it's god's job listen you can't
[1:41:18] positionally place yourself
[1:41:20] amen
[1:41:21] you got to go back to your birth
[1:41:23] and let god place you through your birth
[1:41:25] that's the way the children the children
[1:41:27] did ruben didn't just say this is mine
[1:41:29] we're running across the river you know
[1:41:31] let's draw it i got this
[1:41:34] don't cross this line
[1:41:36] no joshua said okay
[1:41:39] from here
[1:41:40] to the river
[1:41:42] over so many hundred feet thousand feet
[1:41:44] whatever it is this is yours reuben
[1:41:47] gad this is yours over here
[1:41:50] and brother random i'll i'll read it
[1:41:51] next
[1:41:52] next week
[1:41:53] brother brown's talking about dipping
[1:41:55] your foot in oil and all the different
[1:41:56] ones had the different names and they
[1:41:58] were positionally placed right where god
[1:42:00] had put them
[1:42:01] and wants them and he said they're still
[1:42:03] in that position today
[1:42:05] they just don't know it
[1:42:07] they just do not know that they're in
[1:42:08] that position
[1:42:10] and not knowing in that position guess
[1:42:12] what
[1:42:14] they're waiting on me and you to get out
[1:42:16] of the way
[1:42:18] but who's got to see their position
[1:42:19] first
[1:42:21] me and you
[1:42:22] we got to see our position first before
[1:42:25] israel as a nation can get into their
[1:42:27] position
[1:42:28] so who's holding this rapture up
[1:42:32] oh it's just me and brother donnie and
[1:42:34] the sister back there okay well y'all
[1:42:36] pray for us three and um
[1:42:41] confession is good for the soul
[1:42:46] who's our biggest problem you no me
[1:42:51] all right
[1:42:52] you love the lord
[1:42:55] listen he's given something that the
[1:42:56] world does not have
[1:43:00] and listen we didn't separate ourselves
[1:43:02] god did
[1:43:04] god did
[1:43:05] and if the world don't know it then you
[1:43:07] probably need to go to praying
[1:43:09] if the world don't know you're different
[1:43:12] you need to get to praying
[1:43:14] amen
[1:43:16] first corinthians
[1:43:18] 11
[1:43:19] we come to communion time and
[1:43:21] i'm sure glad we're starting taking
[1:43:23] communion and footwashing again because
[1:43:24] it is an ordinance but i just enjoy
[1:43:26] doing it because
[1:43:27] it makes you feel whole it makes you
[1:43:29] feel that you've done what god's told
[1:43:31] hey it's in the will
[1:43:33] we're doing what's in the will all right
[1:43:35] so let's read first corinthians
[1:43:38] verse
[1:43:39] chapter 11 verse 23.
[1:43:43] this is paul talking
[1:43:44] and paul by revelation was the one that
[1:43:46] was given the
[1:43:47] the commission to write this because he
[1:43:49] wasn't even in the upper room so he's
[1:43:51] given it by revelation and given it by
[1:43:53] revelation he's telling you exactly
[1:43:55] what's going on in the upper room for i
[1:43:57] have received of the lord
[1:43:59] that which also i delivered unto you
[1:44:00] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:44:02] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:44:04] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:44:06] and said take heed this is my body which
[1:44:08] is broken for you this due in
[1:44:10] remembrance
[1:44:11] of me
[1:44:12] after the same manner also he took the
[1:44:14] cup when he had sup saying this cup is
[1:44:16] the new testament there's the new
[1:44:18] testament because the testator hadn't
[1:44:19] died yet but he was fixing to die that
[1:44:21] morning the next day
[1:44:22] in my blood this do you as often as you
[1:44:25] drink it in remembrance of me
[1:44:27] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:44:29] drink this cup you do sure the lord
[1:44:30] death till he comes
[1:44:32] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:44:34] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:44:36] unworthily
[1:44:37] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:44:39] the lord
[1:44:40] but let a man examine himself that's
[1:44:42] kind of what we did today
[1:44:43] we examined ourselves to see where our
[1:44:45] position was see if we were in a
[1:44:47] position
[1:44:48] amen
[1:44:50] please folks we got to know where we're
[1:44:52] at
[1:44:52] we got to know who we are
[1:44:55] then we'll see a lot more healings and a
[1:44:56] lot more things going on
[1:44:58] amen
[1:45:01] wherefore who shall ever
[1:45:03] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:45:04] lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:45:06] body and blood of the lord now watch the
[1:45:08] body of the lord the bride
[1:45:11] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:45:13] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:45:15] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:45:17] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:45:19] to himself not deserting the lord's body
[1:45:22] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:45:24] among you in many sleep
[1:45:26] and if we would judge ourselves
[1:45:30] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:45:32] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[1:45:34] we should not be condemned with the
[1:45:35] world
[1:45:36] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:45:38] together to eat terry
[1:45:40] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:45:42] lady meet at home that you come not
[1:45:43] together under condemnation and the rest
[1:45:45] will i set in order
[1:45:47] when i come let's have a moment of
[1:45:49] silent prayer the prophet of god tells
[1:45:51] us to
[1:45:52] clean yourself up
[1:45:54] and pray for your pastor
[1:45:56] so let's have a moment of silent prayer

[1:46:09] here

[1:46:26] of a perfect man we're coming to that
[1:46:28] placing that adoption lord where we know
[1:46:30] what to do with the word when we're
[1:46:32] given

[1:46:38] amen the bible said he took the bread
[1:46:41] and he blessed it dear lord jesus this
[1:46:43] bread lord was made with holy hands
[1:46:46] not just some cracker or a loaf of bread
[1:46:48] that we buy off a shelf lord it's made
[1:46:50] by whoever and whatever but lord know
[1:46:52] it's been made by holy hands the way it
[1:46:54] should have been made
[1:46:55] and father now as we break this let's
[1:46:57] remember lord that your body hung on
[1:46:58] calvary for our sins
[1:47:00] and that body hung on calvary for our
[1:47:03] for our sicknesses lord in our shame and
[1:47:05] the things that we did lord
[1:47:07] and you took every bit of that into your
[1:47:08] bosom lord and you died and you released
[1:47:10] your life lord that it can come back on
[1:47:12] a set of believers
[1:47:13] and you gave us these ordinances lord
[1:47:15] that we should do until you come father
[1:47:17] so as we take this wine and we take this
[1:47:19] bread lord we pray that you sanctify the
[1:47:21] people that are taking it and bless us
[1:47:23] in jesus name
[1:47:25] amen
[1:47:28] you know it's it's interesting
[1:47:33] that the world don't when you tell
[1:47:35] people you take communion
[1:47:37] i came i came across one gentleman
[1:47:40] um just a couple months ago when i was
[1:47:42] getting i was getting my notary
[1:47:45] uh over at the courthouse in banks
[1:47:47] county and his name's tim harper and
[1:47:48] he's a really good guy super nice guy
[1:47:52] and we were talking about church
[1:47:54] and he said
[1:47:55] and he's methodist
[1:47:57] he said how do y'all take communion
[1:47:59] because he knows probably terrence and
[1:48:01] anna more than he does me but i've got
[1:48:03] to know him in the past few years but he
[1:48:05] said how do y'all take communion i said
[1:48:06] well we
[1:48:07] bake our own bread
[1:48:09] we don't buy that store
[1:48:11] we don't put it up overnight i'm gonna
[1:48:13] burn this when i get home i'll take a
[1:48:14] torch and i'll burn this where it will
[1:48:16] be unusable because you don't hold it
[1:48:19] over to the next day all right
[1:48:22] he said well that's wonderful
[1:48:24] he said now i'm gonna ask you
[1:48:27] he said
[1:48:28] what do y'all drink
[1:48:31] i said well tim
[1:48:32] i said we've never drank grape juice
[1:48:36] he said praise the lord
[1:48:38] he said somebody is doing it right
[1:48:42] because as a methodist i mean they take
[1:48:44] it like what we used to do with it we
[1:48:46] used to take and and mom and dad would
[1:48:48] cut it
[1:48:49] make it weaker
[1:48:51] grape juice
[1:48:54] right damn right mom
[1:48:57] the older people couldn't stand the
[1:48:58] grape juice boy they'd die if it drank
[1:49:00] this stuff wouldn't they
[1:49:04] so be careful if you never take
[1:49:06] communion with real wine be careful it's
[1:49:08] real
[1:49:10] but he said thank you for doing that he
[1:49:14] said that's the way it should be done
[1:49:15] see there's people caught in these
[1:49:16] denominations that just do what they
[1:49:19] that do what the denomination does and
[1:49:21] doesn't have a way out
[1:49:23] i told him i said well just come to
[1:49:25] church with us one time first sunday of
[1:49:26] every month we take communion i said
[1:49:28] you'll have wine and you'll have
[1:49:29] you'll have a
[1:49:32] real bread that's made by holy hands
[1:49:35] and that's some of the best wine no we
[1:49:36] wine drinkers but that is some of the
[1:49:38] best wine in the world because it's made
[1:49:40] with holy hands and it's made the right
[1:49:42] way
[1:49:44] the heavenly father we thank you for
[1:49:45] this wine lord
[1:49:46] it's been made lord by holy hands and
[1:49:48] also it's been looked over
[1:49:50] by somebody lord that just takes care of
[1:49:52] this wine and and helps it lord but it
[1:49:55] doesn't help it to get
[1:49:59] father
[1:50:00] it doesn't help it it's not going to get
[1:50:03] rank or or it's going to get better with
[1:50:05] age
[1:50:06] all that grape juice and the things of
[1:50:08] the world all that will rot and go away
[1:50:10] but this wine will just keep getting
[1:50:12] better and better so father as we

[1:50:41] jesus name we pray amen
[1:50:44] yeah the whole world i mean they're
[1:50:46] they're groaning and waiting we didn't
[1:50:48] get to all that for the manifestation of
[1:50:50] the sons of god
[1:50:53] animals
[1:50:54] why do you think there's volcanoes why
[1:50:56] do you think there's tornadoes this
[1:50:58] whole world want to be delivered
[1:51:00] because it's not going to be in the
[1:51:01] millennium it's not going to be in the
[1:51:02] future home
[1:51:04] we're not going to have to worry about
[1:51:05] tornado drills
[1:51:07] anything like that
[1:51:12] it's just like we were talking the other
[1:51:14] day
[1:51:17] we don't know what it feels like not to
[1:51:19] have pain
[1:51:22] or worry
[1:51:25] or what we gonna do tomorrow
[1:51:28] how we gonna get to work
[1:51:31] how long we gonna have to work if
[1:51:33] somebody gonna get ill throw a book at
[1:51:35] me or kick me out
[1:51:37] that's something we fear or worry about
[1:51:38] every day but what about a day when
[1:51:41] number one you don't have a morning
[1:51:42] cause you don't wake up
[1:51:45] it's just day all the
[1:51:46] time and you don't have to worry about
[1:51:49] all that
[1:51:52] what a wonderful time
[1:51:54] it's what is something in store for us
[1:51:56] that we can't fathom we've just got to
[1:51:59] believe that god is going to do it for
[1:52:01] us
[1:52:02] but listen he's going to give us a
[1:52:04] little piece of it now
[1:52:06] because when we come to this adoption in
[1:52:08] placing i believe that
[1:52:10] the fire's going to fly
[1:52:15] i believe that
[1:52:17] god wouldn't have put us in a position
[1:52:18] if he didn't
[1:52:20] he put us all in a place and i believe
[1:52:22] that's where we're at
[1:52:25] that we can know what god wants done
[1:52:28] when he wants it done
[1:52:30] and it will yield ourself
[1:52:32] and let him have dominion over us
[1:52:36] just like it was in
[1:52:38] in the garden of eden
[1:52:40] it wasn't a it wasn't a line eating a
[1:52:44] rabbit or uh
[1:52:46] no
[1:52:47] that's something we're gonna talk about
[1:52:48] in the millennium that's not gonna
[1:52:49] happen in the millennium either
[1:52:51] the lime will lay down with the lamb
[1:52:57] we can't even fathom that
[1:53:01] it'd be led by a child
[1:53:04] a big old ferocious
[1:53:06] line that we would run from and brother
[1:53:08] brown said this morning i read in the
[1:53:10] book he said i wouldn't even trust being
[1:53:12] around one with a 30 odd six much less a
[1:53:14] sling
[1:53:15] that's what he's talking about david you
[1:53:17] know killed the lion and the bear he
[1:53:18] said he said i'd have a 30 out six i
[1:53:20] wouldn't have a sling he was telling the
[1:53:22] truth
[1:53:23] you know humanly but then something
[1:53:25] takes over
[1:53:26] and then what took over with brother
[1:53:28] brian i remember he walked through that
[1:53:29] field that time and the
[1:53:30] and the uh
[1:53:32] bull that had killed a person before
[1:53:34] was laying right there in his way
[1:53:37] and that bull got got up turned around
[1:53:39] charged him
[1:53:41] he said if i'd have had my gun i'd have
[1:53:43] shot him see he was a human
[1:53:46] but god took over
[1:53:49] i said bull stop go lay down
[1:53:53] it said the bull had you if you read it
[1:53:55] you'll see that the i could just see the
[1:53:57] bull the bull had this bewildered look
[1:53:59] on his face
[1:54:00] like where did that power come from
[1:54:03] never felt that power before except back
[1:54:05] in the garden of eden
[1:54:08] that's what we're coming to folks
[1:54:12] that's what we're coming to we must
[1:54:13] believe that
[1:54:16] the word of god promised it
[1:54:18] and listen we're built for this
[1:54:22] we're astronauts we're built for this
[1:54:23] pressure
[1:54:28] if you're not get born again that'll
[1:54:29] help it
[1:54:31] amen
[1:54:33] all right god bless you let's protect
[1:54:35] your communion

[1:55:08] men if you're not taking
[1:55:10] foot washing
[1:55:11] you need to get born again
[1:55:16] just saying
[1:55:19] jesus said you have no part with me if
[1:55:20] you don't
[1:55:22] i'm just telling you what the bible says
[1:55:24] saint john verse 13
[1:55:27] the supper being ended the devil having
[1:55:28] now put in the heart of judah says
[1:55:29] carrot simon's son to betray him
[1:55:32] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:55:34] all things into his hand and that he was
[1:55:35] come from god and went to god
[1:55:38] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:55:40] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:55:41] himself he's fixing to be a servant
[1:55:44] that's what we just read
[1:55:47] the creator
[1:55:48] he created the cloth the water and the
[1:55:50] feet that he was going to wash
[1:55:53] yet he stooped down and listened and
[1:55:55] ain't like us because we take baths all
[1:55:56] the time think about them walking all
[1:55:58] through the brother brown explains it
[1:56:00] walking through the manure and through
[1:56:01] this and through the dust
[1:56:03] that water wasn't clean
[1:56:05] but god didn't mind
[1:56:07] because he said you need to do this till
[1:56:09] i come he rises from supper and laid
[1:56:10] apart inside his garment and took a
[1:56:12] towel and girded himself after that he
[1:56:14] poured water into a basin and began to
[1:56:15] wash the disciples feet and to wipe them
[1:56:18] with a towel where with he was girded
[1:56:20] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[1:56:22] said unto him lord
[1:56:23] thust thou wash my feet jesus said
[1:56:26] what i do thou knowest not now but thou
[1:56:28] shall know hereafter
[1:56:30] peter said unto him thou shalt never now
[1:56:32] look how bold he was thou shall never
[1:56:34] wash my feet
[1:56:37] jesus said if i wash you not you have no
[1:56:40] part with me
[1:56:42] pretty blunt
[1:56:44] simon peter's saying the lord said not
[1:56:46] only my feet
[1:56:47] but my hands and my head wash me all
[1:56:51] jesus said unto him he that is washed
[1:56:53] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[1:56:55] his clean ever wit and you are clean but
[1:56:56] not all for he knew he would betray him
[1:56:59] therefore he said you are not all clean
[1:57:01] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:57:02] had taken his garment was set down again
[1:57:04] he said unto them know you what i have
[1:57:06] done to you
[1:57:08] you call me master and lord and you say
[1:57:09] well for so i am
[1:57:11] if i then your lord and master have
[1:57:13] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:57:15] one another's feet
[1:57:16] for i have given you an example
[1:57:19] that you should do as i have done
[1:57:21] to you
[1:57:22] the god of heaven
[1:57:24] washing
[1:57:27] only brother branham could call him a
[1:57:28] foot wash flunky
[1:57:32] that's what he was
[1:57:33] the god of heaven but he did it what he
[1:57:35] did it for an example for us to do it
[1:57:37] for i've given you an example that you
[1:57:39] should do as i have done to you verily i
[1:57:41] say unto you the servant is not greater
[1:57:43] than his lord neither is he that is sin
[1:57:44] greater he that is in him if you know
[1:57:46] these things happy
