hey what let's do we're bad John do it how about letting the word prayer to get you started sure precious Lord Jesus we thank you so much for this opportunity Lord together Lord truly for this burial of our sister father and Lord we pray you just come down Lord and just bless her in a special way Lord this step just guide her strengthen her Lord as she starts this this new life you father Lord we certainly appreciate you bringing us all out here Lord to witness this Lord to partake Lord and prayer and just lord over our sister Lord over this this baptism father Lord we committed into your hands bless us all Lord keep us guide us Lord Oh father God we just thank you again for our sister bless her give her strength Lord God as he starts this new journey this new life in you father yeah we commit this baptismal service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen [Music] the path to glory you will surely [Music] [Music] long for this day long for this day we're gonna read scripture if you don't mind around here real quick we're looking at two if you want to turn your Bibles listen chapter six or Romans what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound paul says god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein no you're not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life or if we have been planted together what we're gonna do we're gonna plant her and then we're gonna bring her back if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also in the light shall be also in the likeness of Israel knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be I love that word destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin you're dead you're free from sin dead man can't sin that's right amen now if we'd be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead diet no more death had no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under gun and listen to this likewise reckon you also yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus our Lord our sister has made a commitment to die let the old man be buried and then she come up and newness of life I tell you when I did this I laid down that old path I let that literal water and there's nothing to this literal water but I let it just I just let it wash everything right out of me when I came up out of that water I was an empty guy but God filled me with the Holy Ghost right after that that's the way it's supposed to be this is the promise this is the promise me that she'll received the Holy Ghost if she'll keep walking on this is not gonna give her the Holy Ghost she knows that she's been told before this is a step in the right direction that's right and a lot of people will take this step but they're not gonna take it under I'd under the identification of baptism as we're talking about now we're gonna put her in a name not entitled we're gonna baptize her in the name of God Almighty Himself you'll enter into that family of God you just keep walking in God you ever need help you know where it's that you got a whole family help you any way we can and back you up one time for saying so have no fear just like when we put you down in this watery grave die don't worry about the past that was gonna make you think about it don't worry about it is it the devil are yes he's a liar and the author of it masters not he's not the author of confusion he's the author of life so our sisters made a commitment and today we've all come today to witness this everybody around dears church members were witnessing then our sister has made a commitment to die yes and we're gonna help her by putting her in a watery icy cold grave but when she comes back she's gonna come back in newness of life so to fulfill the great commission that Jesus told all this disciples to go into all the world preach the gospel baptizing in the name of the Father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost which were titled not a name but then you go over in the book of Acts Peter says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so we're gonna baptize our sister and a wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] tell are you backing her up give her the assurance that we're gonna be right there with a man darkest hours right now and then when we leave out of here he's really not gonna matter brother right because we're not going to work we're gonna be in glory we're gonna be standing there with brother Eugene College all the brothers just left us here and her sisters it's over in another dimension I just tell her brother Joe we were we were talking about though you look on some of these trees in the springtime and you see this little shell of a bug called the Catena that's Kate is not there it's just a shame that's it used to be but they just a shell there and there's a crack and now somewhere where's neither somewhere there's a new person there's a green big old Wingspread beautiful person flying around because they left that old shell and one day we're gonna leave this world so I may have to go by the old shell leave the old shell here some of us are gonna believe that we're gonna take a body can but it all starts right here it's watery great god bless you for coming we appreciate you being here brother Rafe you wouldn't dismiss us in a word of Prayer brother Joe was thing [Music] [Music]
