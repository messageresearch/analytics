[13:41] into the mountains together and and have
[13:44] a little time fellowshipping you know
[13:45] for two or three days and uh you know so
[13:49] what we've got is a little surprise for
[13:51] you maybe this coming wife came up with
[13:54] a good idea this coming Sunday to all of
[13:57] the married women because you don't want
[14:00] to say uh mothers because some you know
[14:03] maybe don't have any children but they
[14:05] are potentials and they are still women
[14:08] so they're sisters so we'll have a
[14:10] sisters you know thing something this
[14:13] coming Sunday for each and every one of
[14:16] you and that'll that'll take care of it
[14:18] all right
[14:20] now I've been trying to get something
[14:23] across and once we finish the series is
[14:26] back behind this I told you we were
[14:29] going to just pick some things and talk
[14:31] about it along the way you know and and
[14:34] be able to uh to cover some things and I
[14:38] I had it lined up to go a certain way
[14:40] tonight well I'm not going to be able to
[14:43] probably go that way so you know just
[14:45] bear with me because you know I want to
[14:48] I want to be a help and I want to be one
[14:50] thing I want you and I to see a reality
[14:54] amen of re
[14:57] realization you know who we are and what
[15:00] we're doing amen because what use is it
[15:04] to just go to church and be good and you
[15:06] know a lot of people in the world are
[15:08] doing that today and they'll just pass
[15:11] on and be whatever they are in their
[15:14] time and ages or whatever you know it's
[15:16] between them and the Lord but see we've
[15:19] got to have something
[15:21] real to not just talk about it right
[15:24] brother we'll get to that the Lord
[15:25] willing in the message in a minute but
[15:27] just remember that okay Hebrews 11
[15:30] father we thank you for everything and
[15:32] We Praise Your Great Name and truly you
[15:35] are God and change not and in being that
[15:39] way we can depend upon you to help us
[15:41] and Aid us be with each one remember the
[15:43] sick among us and you said you sent your
[15:46] word and healed us so we believe it and
[15:48] just have your way Lord in the service
[15:51] tonight and as we speak about you you
[15:53] come on the scene and bring your word to
[15:56] pass among us because we believe it
[15:59] we love you and we thank you forgive our
[16:01] sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness
[16:04] and guide us in you and keep us in Jesus
[16:06] name
[16:08] amen Hebrews 11 very familiar scripture
[16:11] with all of us
[16:14] right now Faith is the substance of
[16:17] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[16:20] Not
[16:21] Seen
[16:23] now
[16:26] hope the word hope and the
[16:30] Bible it to us it means hoping hoping
[16:35] you
[16:35] know but in the Bible
[16:38] terminologies it's it's something that's
[16:42] real
[16:44] right it's not that you're hoping for it
[16:48] that's it's not something outd that
[16:51] you're hoping right if it is it's not a
[16:55] faith all right see that that's the
[16:57] point I want us to see see so when we
[16:59] read the Bible and we talk about Hope
[17:01] and see against hope or was it Paul was
[17:05] saying about Abraham believed in Hope
[17:06] see it wouldn't wouldn't just a hope
[17:09] well I hope I'm saved you know I hope I
[17:13] no no it's got to be a reality now Faith
[17:16] is the substance of things hope
[17:18] far now remember it's a
[17:21] substance amen whatever you're Desiring
[17:25] that's
[17:26] what faith is
[17:29] right if you can accept it that way the
[17:32] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[17:34] the elders obtained a good report
[17:36] through faith we understand that the
[17:38] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[17:41] that things which are seen were not made
[17:43] of things which do
[17:45] appear by faith Abel offered unto God a
[17:48] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[17:50] which he obtained witness that he was
[17:52] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[17:55] and by it he being dead yet speak
[17:59] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[18:01] should not see death and was not found
[18:05] because God had translated him but
[18:08] before his translation he had this
[18:10] testimony that he pleased
[18:12] God but without faith it is impossible
[18:15] to please him for he that cometh to God
[18:18] must believe that he was maybe will be
[18:20] sometime can
[18:22] be you know that's the way our mind
[18:25] translates it right but that's not what
[18:27] the Bible saying for he that cometh to
[18:30] God must believe that he is right now
[18:34] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[18:36] diligently seek Him you may be seated
[18:38] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[18:41] of the word now we were talking
[18:45] about you know this past Sunday speaking
[18:48] on the Rapture and talking about that
[18:52] the the word rapture is not even in the
[18:55] Bible it means to be caught away and
[18:59] Paul covers it you know that we'll be
[19:01] caught
[19:02] up to meet the Lord in the hour see it's
[19:06] not something that is
[19:10] um the point I want you to get is my my
[19:13] main thing is it's changed the sermon so
[19:16] I I've got to change my thinking because
[19:19] you know not that I was wrong in what I
[19:21] doing it was just the approach that that
[19:23] came to me to change over to a different
[19:26] way all right
[19:28] but see I'm trying to get you and I to
[19:30] see one
[19:32] thing Faith now is the
[19:37] substance so now you're you're searching
[19:40] for something you're hunting for it
[19:43] you're Desiring it healing salvation
[19:46] whatever well see then you got to come
[19:48] to a place to be able to see that you
[19:50] actually have the
[19:54] substance he said but now now but
[19:56] brother Dale now see that's where our
[19:58] old good old religious ways you know I
[20:02] don't want to say that I'm Healed when
[20:04] I'm not because I don't want to make God
[20:07] a liar you already made him a
[20:10] liar when you won't say what he says he
[20:14] says you're healed right all right so
[20:18] why can't we say that we're healed all
[20:21] right see because Faith then being the
[20:24] substance of
[20:26] that it if you were searching after
[20:29] something you know uh you know remember
[20:33] one comes to mind sister Kathy lost her
[20:36] pocketbook well you know we prayed and
[20:41] you know what our pocketbook came back
[20:44] well see
[20:47] somebody touched God in a situation
[20:52] that it brought to p a substance
[20:57] right and it would have been great if
[20:59] somebody had have called her up on the
[21:01] phone and said well I you know I found
[21:03] your
[21:05] pocketbook he said
[21:07] Glory I found she found my pocket or
[21:10] they found my pocketbook but said I lost
[21:16] it well you you don't have a substance
[21:19] do
[21:19] you are are you understanding it see
[21:23] this person over here had the substance
[21:25] for a little while but they lost the
[21:27] substance
[21:28] right well that's that's the point of
[21:31] what I'm wanting you and I to do brother
[21:32] B said you prayed for you're healed so
[21:35] you have the substance he said but then
[21:37] you let it come
[21:39] back he said and you lose your faith he
[21:43] said really what you lose is your
[21:47] substance he said you still have your
[21:51] confession and you can call that
[21:54] Faith you know but that's not faith that
[21:58] goes on that's a hope that we use as
[22:01] hoping as something where the Bible is
[22:03] not using it that way it's using it as a
[22:06] positive statement you know like when it
[22:09] says I
[22:11] know well that's not well I hope or yeah
[22:14] I know yeah yeah people say yeah I know
[22:16] I
[22:18] know but bring it down to a
[22:22] reality faith is the
[22:25] substance all right
[22:28] now we were talking about the Rapture
[22:31] and we hadn't covered all of it we'll
[22:32] get a little bit more maybe the Lord
[22:34] willing
[22:35] Sunday but we're talking about how
[22:39] that we're being caught
[22:43] up all right now if you can't see it as
[22:46] something real or a
[22:48] tangible
[22:49] something and you know what I mean by
[22:52] tangible I mean that you have
[22:56] it but nobody else can see
[23:00] it if have you ever been healed I mean
[23:03] the Lord spoke to you and you was healed
[23:06] all right now all right see then you had
[23:10] something that nobody
[23:13] else didn't have now they had it for
[23:16] themselves right but they didn't have
[23:19] what you had you had a substance they
[23:22] got a
[23:24] confession amen but like I said then you
[23:26] can lose the confession
[23:29] see the lady would say I've got your
[23:31] pocketbook it's yours I know it's your
[23:33] name in it but I lost
[23:36] it my husband throw it in the trash you
[23:40] know thinking it wouldn't mine you know
[23:44] something happened see what you done you
[23:47] lost a
[23:49] tangible all right now you ever notice
[23:51] brother R said you're saved as long as
[23:54] you keep your
[23:56] confession
[23:59] all
[24:00] right he said as long as you keep your
[24:03] confession all right well then we to
[24:05] keep confessing
[24:06] it I was talking to a lady today getting
[24:08] a haircut I said when you got something
[24:11] that's not a like a caner or something I
[24:14] said then you can you can do different
[24:17] in healing you you can confess your way
[24:20] into
[24:21] it and I said you just start saying by
[24:24] Stripes I'm
[24:26] Healed and you just keep saying by
[24:28] Stripes I'm
[24:30] Healed you know what one day you walk
[24:33] away with what you're confessing because
[24:35] you're saying what God says right but
[24:40] now we found out the Rapture is being
[24:43] called away and I told you that the way
[24:48] I see it the way I believe it I believe
[24:50] the day you got born
[24:54] again that you started a process
[24:59] right that will eventually be made
[25:02] totally
[25:04] manifest in the whole
[25:07] being to come into reality of
[25:11] Redemption all right see then this is
[25:14] the day that we're to do
[25:17] this how long have I preached on
[25:20] recognizing your day in this message to
[25:22] try to get us to see to talk about the
[25:24] things to talk about even the brother
[25:27] randam and the great Miracles and the
[25:29] great signs and wonders that took place
[25:32] in his
[25:34] ministry and I'm not saying this
[25:37] derogatory I'm saying it
[25:39] correctly even with that
[25:43] confession that word he brought he went
[25:47] by the
[25:49] grave now that's not throwing off on
[25:53] him you know people say oh you th no no
[25:56] I'm I'm trying to that's truth isn't it
[26:00] yeah but you don't understand well I
[26:01] know I don't understand that that's why
[26:03] I'm depending on the Lord amen amen
[26:09] now see then if we talk about the
[26:11] Rapture as a
[26:13] process just like the stature of a
[26:15] perfect man he born again at Faith
[26:18] virtue knowledge Temperance patience God
[26:21] coming on out to The Headstone it's a
[26:24] process in our lives that's taking place
[26:27] on all right now to me then the Rapture
[26:30] is that
[26:35] way it's it's the point that we are
[26:38] being caught
[26:42] up all
[26:44] right
[26:46] now in doing that then we've already as
[26:49] the prophet we brought out Sunday said
[26:52] the Lord Jesus does these three things
[26:55] in his descending outout the voice of
[26:58] the Archangel and the trumpet right you
[27:01] remember that Sunday we were dealing
[27:03] with it all right now the Lord does that
[27:06] in his
[27:09] descending
[27:11] okay but Rapture is going that
[27:16] way what do you want to call it stepping
[27:18] into another dimension whatever you make
[27:21] it but it's being caught
[27:26] up all right so the day we got bornn
[27:30] again we were caught up into as Paul
[27:34] calls it that's why I've got two
[27:36] messages and I'm going with it but Paul
[27:39] calls
[27:40] it Heavenly places in Christ
[27:47] Jesus the new
[27:49] birth puts you and I in Heavenly places
[27:54] where in the soul amen
[27:58] it will bring the body under subjection
[28:01] to that yes but it begins by raising
[28:06] that person spiritually speaking as we'd
[28:09] call it in the soul up into another
[28:13] dimension or whatever you want to call
[28:16] it all right so then it's Heavenly
[28:22] places and he gave us many spiritual
[28:26] blessings in Christ Jesus according to
[28:29] Ephesians
[28:32] 1:3 and see we look at the pyramid and
[28:34] we see those
[28:38] blessings and we see Faith virtue
[28:41] knowledge Temperance patience all right
[28:43] we go into Paul and it's love joy peace
[28:47] goodness meekness gentleness
[28:50] Etc spiritual blessings in spiritual
[28:54] Heavenly
[28:56] places
[28:58] now we used
[29:01] to and you know it's not throwing off on
[29:03] the way it's the way we
[29:06] was but we used to our basis of thinking
[29:09] of
[29:11] Salvation was I believe I'm saved I hope
[29:13] I'm saved maybe I'm saved or I believe
[29:14] I'm
[29:15] saved well then you had the others that
[29:18] had the positive attitude you know there
[29:20] are people that are positive there are
[29:22] people that are um middle phase of pro
[29:28] and then there's people that just don't
[29:29] have
[29:30] much you know
[29:33] profession all right now if you asked me
[29:37] when I was in the Baptist had have said
[29:39] was you saved i' said
[29:44] yes cuz I was one of those positive
[29:50] thinkers I was 18 years old before I was
[29:53] converted so it wasn't a point of just
[29:56] you know somebody talking me into it
[29:59] I've told you about it when I told the
[30:01] the people I said I live a better life
[30:03] than your Deacon board lives and you're
[30:05] trying to get me to be saved you need to
[30:08] go back and talk to them you
[30:12] know but the thing of it was in one day
[30:15] I came to a reality of
[30:19] a of a fact
[30:21] that I believe then in being
[30:25] positive all right
[30:29] and not just saying well I hope I'm
[30:31] saved I was PR out in the Baptist Church
[30:34] but was not even through the Born Again
[30:36] experience I've told you about that I
[30:38] got that
[30:39] later but I had a positive attitude or
[30:43] thoughts in my mind about
[30:46] salvation all right but you know
[30:49] yourself that a lot of people never had
[30:51] those positive points so they wavered up
[30:54] and down and in and out and
[30:58] we had one man that every time he'd have
[31:00] a Revival he'd come to the church and
[31:02] he'd go to the Altar and he'd cry and he
[31:04] said I got it this time You' never make
[31:06] it to the second
[31:09] night but I heard one day he finally did
[31:12] well thank God you know I hope he did
[31:16] you know but my point is he got
[31:20] something that
[31:22] night that stirred his
[31:25] heart but yet it never made an anchor in
[31:29] the
[31:29] soul of something
[31:32] real or he wouldn't have been that
[31:35] way we see raised up sitting in Heavenly
[31:41] places by the new
[31:44] birth now listen to what I'm
[31:47] saying you that claim the new
[31:50] birth before you heard of this
[31:53] message and I I believe in it I I
[31:57] believe there were a lot of people had
[31:58] the new
[31:59] birth I can go back and show you where
[32:02] brother Brown said he met people had the
[32:03] Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that fell
[32:06] on the day of
[32:08] Pentecost 50 years before he come along
[32:11] all right I believe in
[32:12] that all right but my point is this do
[32:16] you realize that if you really did
[32:19] receive the new
[32:22] birth now then you didn't have to wait
[32:25] for this message to get the new birth
[32:27] earth right amen you had it and you were
[32:31] sitting in Heavenly
[32:34] places and that's why when you heard the
[32:38] message I believe that all right see
[32:41] then it meant something to you right
[32:44] amen why because you were not just a h
[32:48] Hazard flim flamy or whatever the words
[32:51] would be for Christian as we'd call it
[32:54] that's up and down and in and out and it
[32:57] was at least
[32:58] settled enough on Christianity to go to
[33:02] church to be good we start living right
[33:06] you know paying you tithe living for the
[33:08] Lord serving
[33:14] God see this message didn't bring the
[33:17] New
[33:21] Birth now come on listen to what I'm
[33:23] saying now so hold it right I believe in
[33:26] a birth of the message yes
[33:29] sir but I believe the new birth it came
[33:31] on the day of Pentecost ausa Street
[33:34] Pentecost according to your Prophet 1906
[33:38] where everybody know what I'm saying was
[33:41] the same holy ghost that fell on the de
[33:43] of
[33:44] Pentecost that's what he said so now you
[33:47] argue with brother Brown you can say you
[33:50] don't believe it all you want to so if
[33:52] you say you don't believe it you think
[33:54] he's
[33:55] wrong right
[33:59] you say I just can't see that well then
[34:01] you mean he's wrong and you're right cuz
[34:04] you can't
[34:06] see
[34:09] right but you see that new birth that
[34:11] you
[34:13] received brought those Pentecostals who
[34:16] really had the new birth into Heavenly
[34:20] places justification brought Luther and
[34:25] the people of that day who received that
[34:27] new birth into Heavenly
[34:31] places Wesley Baptist Methodist
[34:34] Presbyterian
[34:36] whatever Heavenly places by the new
[34:39] birth all
[34:42] right so then God already as I've tried
[34:45] to explain to you when he gave you that
[34:48] new birth he laid claim on that body
[34:50] that you're living in that's right
[34:53] that's why we don't believe in getting a
[34:55] new body and on another body some
[34:56] different body we believe in this body
[34:59] made
[35:00] new all
[35:02] right now in that
[35:05] then the Rapture started the day
[35:10] you received Jesus
[35:13] Christ all right now I didn't say it was
[35:16] over with
[35:19] right because it put you in Heavenly
[35:22] places all right
[35:25] now
[35:27] in the Bible
[35:30] then was written a
[35:35] prophecy
[35:37] now that's where I told brother Joe and
[35:39] him to put waiting for the Revelation
[35:41] the
[35:42] prophecy on to the people where they can
[35:46] listen you know until the Bible is made
[35:49] known to you it's only a prophecy that's
[35:51] right I don't care how much you can read
[35:54] how much you can talk about you can talk
[35:56] about one God
[35:57] you can give me all the scriptures you
[35:58] can show me all the doings you you know
[36:01] you put every little little dot to every
[36:04] a little thing you know but until it's
[36:08] revealed it's a
[36:11] prophecy all
[36:15] right there was a prophecy put in the
[36:18] Bible by a great man and remember now
[36:21] how I explain prophecy to a
[36:25] prophet I attempted to you know over
[36:28] time like this when non saw chariots
[36:31] josling in the streets he saw
[36:35] 2014 you know uh 85 downtown Atlanta you
[36:42] know and if it have been anything that
[36:44] he could have explained that with he
[36:47] would have wrote down Buicks and O
[36:49] mobiles and Cadillacs Etc running like
[36:52] lightning with the headlights on and you
[36:54] know all right
[36:57] but yet he couldn't explain it that way
[36:59] so he had to write it down the way he
[37:01] his words of that day so he saw chariots
[37:03] joshing in the
[37:04] street but you know to him it was
[37:08] real all right see I believe when a
[37:12] prophet brings the
[37:16] Scriptures it may not be even real to
[37:19] anyone
[37:21] else cuz he may be speaking of a future
[37:25] event but to to him it's a
[37:29] reality do you understand to him it's
[37:34] real all right and that's why brother
[37:38] around would say I'm not saying he's
[37:41] coming said I'm saying he's
[37:46] here all
[37:48] right a reality of realities or or a
[37:52] revelation into it a
[37:55] substance
[37:58] but you see he
[38:01] spoke like Paul
[38:03] spoke so there was a prophecy in the
[38:06] Bible now do you follow my line up you
[38:09] had a new
[38:10] birth Luther had it wesler had it
[38:12] Pentecost had it every age had the new
[38:14] birth every age had the holy ghost in
[38:17] the New Birth all
[38:20] right but there was something sealed up
[38:23] in the
[38:25] word and it was was there in first
[38:30] Thessalonians that would be pointing
[38:32] Paul would be pointing 2,000
[38:36] years right to the end
[38:41] time but the Lord himself shall descend
[38:44] from heaven with a shout well now that
[38:47] was different the I'm I'm having to stay
[38:50] away from some of the messages that that
[38:53] I got but remember on the coming of the
[38:56] Lord you got a lot of scriptures to be
[38:58] lined up and if you get them lined up
[39:00] wrong you got a
[39:02] problem right so we got to get
[39:05] everything lined up and to see it
[39:07] correctly to understand
[39:09] it they had that new birth down to the
[39:12] ages they were resurrected sitting in
[39:15] Heavenly places even those early church
[39:17] ages up to to Columba was up into here
[39:21] where it says holy spirit but now not
[39:22] The Headstone because the prophet said
[39:24] it wouldn't all right
[39:28] but he said it will
[39:29] come well that was a
[39:32] prophecy when Paul said the Lord himself
[39:34] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[39:37] you know
[39:38] what I don't doubt what he didn't
[39:42] see the very end
[39:47] time
[39:49] right now I I know I'm funny the way I
[39:52] think and that's all
[39:55] right
[39:57] for me to say that Paul saw the end
[40:00] time he didn't necessarily see
[40:02] everything transpiring all of the doing
[40:05] I'm not talking like that I'm talking
[40:08] about that he saw the
[40:12] situation he knew something was going to
[40:16] happen I believe if You' have said
[40:19] Paul you have just said that the Lord
[40:22] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[40:24] shout voice of an arang angel in a
[40:26] trumpet now what do you mean you know
[40:28] what he said what I
[40:31] said you know
[40:34] right he said what I
[40:38] said I said the Lord would
[40:42] descend but what did we have for 2,000
[40:44] years we don't know we don't understand
[40:49] a shout oh you
[40:54] know B of an AR Angel great sweep and a
[41:01] Trum but if you said Paul is that what
[41:04] you
[41:07] mean he just said
[41:09] no I mean what I
[41:13] said I said the Lord shall descend
[41:18] right well even though it said that who
[41:21] emphasized that
[41:25] point you know come
[41:28] on go through your your Scholars and
[41:31] things see if they emphasize that
[41:33] point but you're come a
[41:37] prophet he used that scripture I've
[41:39] looked at him over about two or three
[41:41] weeks now this is scanning through you
[41:44] know and looking at things like
[41:47] that don't tell them how many times he
[41:49] preached and use the Lord himself shall
[41:52] descend from heaven with a
[41:53] shout voice of an archangel a trumpet
[41:58] but then one day he made an outstanding
[42:01] statement that brought a Clarity to what
[42:04] he was
[42:06] saying he said Jesus does all three of
[42:09] these in his
[42:11] descending well you know what that was
[42:15] what Paul
[42:17] said
[42:21] right Paul said the
[42:23] Lord will descend
[42:28] from the heaven now let's bring Paul and
[42:31] brother randam together and make it in
[42:34] terminology of the
[42:36] day he said Paul what did you see he
[42:41] said I saw the Lord
[42:45] descend said one day he's
[42:48] coming and said not his first coming cuz
[42:51] said that's over
[42:52] with right we'll get back to these
[42:55] things later he is first com remember he
[42:57] comes three
[42:58] times he comes one time to get his bride
[43:01] he comes second time I mean one time to
[43:04] redeem his bride second time to get his
[43:06] bride third time with his bride all
[43:09] right he covers three times but there's
[43:11] more comings than those three you got to
[43:14] coming to Israel you got the coming to
[43:15] 144,000 you got the coming to different
[43:18] situations that are in the Bible and if
[43:20] you don't get them lined up correctly
[43:23] then you you you won't follow it
[43:26] which Paul if you could have got him to
[43:29] have said
[43:30] it he said one of these days there's
[43:33] going to be a message come
[43:37] forth that Jesus Christ is the same
[43:41] yesterday today and
[43:44] forever amen that's right and said that
[43:48] will be what I tried to
[43:51] say of his
[43:53] descending see
[43:57] but when God said write it down he said
[43:59] put it down as a
[44:06] shout
[44:08] well you know Paul writes down
[44:11] shout but Paul is sitting there knowing
[44:14] what he's
[44:18] doing and then he
[44:21] says there'll be a voice of an
[44:25] archangel
[44:28] now we're taking Paul and brother
[44:31] brandom and bringing it to the day do
[44:33] you understand
[44:37] me Paul would say the voice of the
[44:41] Archangel you said Paul who's the
[44:43] Archangel he would have said what do you
[44:46] mean who's the Archangel he's the angel
[44:48] of the Covenant he said Jesus Christ he
[44:51] said I just got through telling you the
[44:52] Lord I just got through saying Jesus
[44:57] will descend with a
[45:04] message and said Jesus was the one that
[45:06] raised the
[45:09] dead he said well how do you know that's
[45:11] right because when I go over and read
[45:14] the Rapture message that's exactly what
[45:17] the prophet
[45:20] said took place and will take place read
[45:24] the rapture
[45:26] he said the same loud voice that raised
[45:31] Lazarus
[45:36] well well I thought Archangel would be
[45:39] some kind of doing something I'm not
[45:41] throwing no Stones I just say things and
[45:44] then but that's what everybody's got it
[45:47] all figured
[45:49] out but we're going to go back in the
[45:52] scriptures
[45:54] Paul would you you
[45:57] agree let's see what let me see if I can
[45:59] get to
[46:00] quote but R said if Luther was here
[46:03] today he' believe this message now
[46:05] that's
[46:07] verbatim but I'll be glad to find the
[46:09] statement part of it in order to be
[46:11] sensible enough to know it without
[46:14] having to have it as a direct quote you
[46:17] ought to know that's the truth amen
[46:19] right Paul saw the Lord descending with
[46:23] a message and the Archangel would the
[46:26] resurrection and there'd be a trumpet to
[46:29] call the
[46:32] people and that trumpet would have to
[46:34] deal with dealing with taking us to the
[46:36] Rapture taking Israel to
[46:40] the right come
[46:43] on a
[46:45] trumpet all
[46:48] right now brother brandom and Paul is
[46:52] saying the same
[46:54] thing
[46:56] but yet when Paul said it it was hidden
[47:00] from the eyes of the wise and
[47:02] prudent
[47:03] right but revealed to the prophet
[47:06] because that's scripture right Amos 3
[47:08] and 7 or whatever I believe that's right
[47:10] isn't it he does nothing but he revealed
[47:12] his secret to the
[47:14] prophets all
[47:16] right when that Prophet was preaching
[47:19] could he tell us something different
[47:21] from the
[47:23] Bible no he was telling us what the
[47:26] Bible
[47:27] said so Paul said Jesus does all three
[47:32] of these things as he
[47:39] descends but yet in his statement
[47:42] then and writing it
[47:45] down it's not that he was trying to be
[47:49] deceiving but he wrote what the Lord
[47:51] wanted him to
[47:53] write right a shout voice Archangel a
[48:02] trumpet we see BR brandom didn't have to
[48:04] come
[48:06] to change the writing of the
[48:10] Bible but what did he say that was to be
[48:14] he said it says what it means and means
[48:18] what it says so that was our
[48:23] trouble it never said there'd be a great
[48:27] big holl take place hey can't you just
[48:30] see all oh everybody here now it's on
[48:34] internet everybody around the world
[48:35] could hear the voice of the Lord through
[48:38] the
[48:38] internet that's not the
[48:44] Bible then we try to figure out the
[48:46] Archangel and what's
[48:49] that then we try to figure out the
[48:51] trumpet and what's
[48:54] that
[48:57] but listen to what I'm getting
[49:01] at the day you receive that new
[49:04] birth it raised you into Heavenly
[49:07] places now listen to the way I say
[49:12] it you heard a message or you could have
[49:16] never been
[49:20] saved are you with
[49:23] me you heard a message
[49:29] come
[49:31] on see then you were told by
[49:35] Paul believe in your heart confess with
[49:39] your
[49:40] mouth there's nobody ever been saved
[49:43] there's nowhere in the Bible that the
[49:44] holy ghost ever fell that there wasn't a
[49:47] message being preached
[49:52] right all
[49:54] right well see then for you to get the
[49:57] new birth you heard the
[50:00] message I I believe that this man right
[50:04] over
[50:05] here in a a non-denominational
[50:09] church could be used of God to preach
[50:14] and a person could get born
[50:18] again but the problem is they're not
[50:20] going to stay with
[50:23] him right that's not throwing off nobody
[50:27] I put the credit to where it is and what
[50:28] it's doing he' be counted for leading
[50:31] that sheep to
[50:33] Christ but the Sheep has to go on to get
[50:35] some sheep food
[50:38] right so you had to hear a
[50:41] message before you could be born again
[50:44] right well why would there be any
[50:45] trouble
[50:47] then what would be the trouble of
[50:49] believing that the Lord would descend
[50:51] with a
[50:54] message
[50:56] and that that message would be his
[50:58] actual
[51:03] coming amen it's not
[51:06] physical the new birth is not physical
[51:09] is it no it's a spiritual
[51:16] happening and see then we're resurrected
[51:19] sitting in Heavenly places by the new
[51:21] birth right we heard a message to get
[51:24] born again
[51:25] so then when it come that this message
[51:27] would come
[51:30] forth now we know and believe as I said
[51:35] prophecy Paul what are you
[51:39] saying Paul putting all together in his
[51:42] language of his
[51:43] speech he said we now have the new
[51:47] birth we now have Christ in you the hope
[51:50] of glory we now have the life that I
[51:53] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[51:56] the Son of
[51:58] God what said
[52:04] Paul you seem to be pointing to a future
[52:09] time when you said the Lord himself
[52:11] shall descend from
[52:13] heaven he
[52:15] said that's what I'm
[52:18] doing I'm pointing to 2,000 years later
[52:23] maybe not telling how far or
[52:28] whatever and you say well Paul all right
[52:31] now you've prophesied or something what
[52:34] should we
[52:38] do you
[52:40] know he said well let me just turn over
[52:43] here and let Jude tell you what to
[52:46] do said because he believes what I
[52:50] believe all right Jude what should we do
[52:52] he said earnestly contend for the faith
[52:54] that was once delivered done to the
[52:58] Saints let's let Peter talk about
[53:01] this Rapture this caught
[53:05] away Peter says being born again add to
[53:08] your faith virture knowledge Temperance
[53:10] patience
[53:12] godliness a
[53:16] preparation you remember I mentioned it
[53:18] the other day because brother Mo
[53:19] preached that years ago and it really
[53:21] was outstanding to
[53:22] me waiting
[53:25] a place to be
[53:29] waiting now when you receive the new
[53:32] birth at
[53:34] Faith sure we'll go with it that you get
[53:37] a portion of these
[53:39] things
[53:41] okay you get a portion of
[53:44] love but that's not the love of The
[53:47] Headstone not that the love of The
[53:48] Headstone is something different a
[53:50] different thing it's just more of it
[53:53] right right amen all
[53:57] right and Paul says there's going to be
[54:00] a falling
[54:05] away right that was a
[54:11] prophecy these things in other words
[54:13] he's explaining these things can't take
[54:15] place until a fallen away
[54:18] comes well you know how I preach
[54:21] that I see the biggest falling way is
[54:24] right now
[54:26] for the people that are falling away
[54:28] from this
[54:32] message that used to they would not say
[54:35] one word against a prophet now they're
[54:37] telling how wrong he is that's the
[54:39] falling away because remember to fall
[54:42] away you got to be somewhere to fall
[54:46] from right I can't fall off the top of
[54:50] the house I'm not up there but I can
[54:53] fall off of this little
[54:55] 6 in
[54:58] platform
[55:00] right but you understand what I'm saying
[55:02] I'm taking the Bible and letting it say
[55:06] what brother randam has said and letting
[55:08] brother randam say what the Bible has
[55:14] said see then here he comes here comes a
[55:17] man on the scene in the 40s 30s and
[55:20] things and he begins to
[55:24] preach and he begins to tell us about
[55:27] these things the faith of the
[55:30] fathers the great
[55:32] things he begins to preach those things
[55:35] unto us
[55:38] and he can he goes with Jude of
[55:40] earnestly contending for the
[55:43] faith how many times has he used
[55:46] that and as I said a moment ago how many
[55:48] times does he use the Lord himself shall
[55:51] descend from heaven with a shout voice
[55:52] of Archangel and trumpet out of
[55:54] Thessalonians
[56:00] he's believing in something in a
[56:05] reality but yet he knows there's
[56:07] something
[56:10] wrong he comes up in there pretty close
[56:12] to the
[56:14] seals and I'll find you the
[56:18] messages but he said I've lost the love
[56:21] for the
[56:23] people I said Lord help
[56:28] me he comes in and he starts telling the
[56:31] visions and the things that that people
[56:34] dreams had had in the thing right prior
[56:36] like in the sir what time is
[56:41] it and he gets over after a while and he
[56:43] makes this statement he
[56:45] said if this is not that said I'm going
[56:48] to just go into them mountains I'm
[56:50] paraphrasing it with a lot of messages
[56:52] right you know it's right I'm going
[56:54] going into them mountains and taking
[56:56] neither food nor water and I ain't
[56:59] coming out of there until God speaks to
[57:01] me he said because you can't go no I
[57:04] can't go no
[57:07] further it gets on spoken words Original
[57:11] Seed he says Lord this is paraphrasing
[57:14] almost perfect verb Lord I got him out
[57:16] on the
[57:19] limb What Can I
[57:23] Do Lord said pick up your pen and
[57:28] write he says and as of as yet Malachi 4
[57:34] is not
[57:35] fulfilled how many times did he preach
[57:37] Malachi 4 between before
[57:40] 1962 How many times did he talk about it
[57:43] being
[57:47] fulfilled yet the Lord said it's not
[57:49] fulfilled
[57:51] yet well what was he going to do you
[58:00] he doesn't know where to go and what to
[58:02] do he said he
[58:05] didn't I'm taking neither food nor
[58:08] water he said I can't go on this
[58:13] way but yet the Lord made
[58:17] him and he sees the great things or the
[58:20] opening of the seals the great points
[58:22] that he goes
[58:23] through
[58:25] he goes through all of his ministry that
[58:27] we could spend hours of growth
[58:29] developments coming up through to see
[58:31] what he was doing but to run it through
[58:33] in a hurry he gets over and right before
[58:36] his death and he preaches a message
[58:39] called The
[58:41] Rapture that's where he said Jesus does
[58:45] all these three
[58:47] things in his
[58:50] descending but you want to go back and
[58:52] run your computer just run shout voice
[58:54] Archangel trumpet and see if brother Ram
[58:56] didn't talk about Jesus being the
[58:58] Archangel see if he didn't talk about
[59:00] the shout being the message that wasn't
[59:03] the first time he spoke of
[59:05] it and he talked about a trumpet he even
[59:07] said I believe it's 10 virgins he said a
[59:10] gospel trumpet or something we mentioned
[59:12] the trumpet and he tells you he said
[59:13] Israel was always gathered by the
[59:20] trumpets but you see it became a reality
[59:28] now to Paul it was a prophecy because it
[59:32] could not be
[59:35] fulfilled did you listen to what I said
[59:37] now he saw it to him it was
[59:41] reality but nobody could make that
[59:43] manifest why because it was a
[59:48] prophecy when that Prophet came out
[59:50] there and speak speaking that day it was
[59:54] no longer longer a
[59:55] prophecy to
[59:59] him did you see where I said it to
[1:00:04] him he was the only one in the world
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:08] understood according to records They
[1:00:11] said that he asked them on the future
[1:00:13] home how many of them understood what he
[1:00:17] said
[1:00:20] and had a while said he said I can count
[1:00:22] on my hands how many understood
[1:00:25] about the future home that's a Simple
[1:00:28] Plan of
[1:00:29] Redemption but get what I'm talking
[1:00:31] about now right in the ending of the
[1:00:34] winding up his
[1:00:37] ministry he speaks of something and I'll
[1:00:41] listen to what I'm saying now and you'll
[1:00:43] get it reason it changed the part in my
[1:00:45] message I'll get the rest of it
[1:00:49] later when he began to speak that
[1:00:51] message that
[1:00:53] day it was no longer a prophecy to
[1:00:57] him it was a
[1:01:02] reality now
[1:01:05] listen because at that
[1:01:07] time the message had already went
[1:01:11] forth he only preached a few sermons
[1:01:14] after the Rapture
[1:01:17] message the message had already been
[1:01:23] preached now watch come from a prophecy
[1:01:26] to
[1:01:28] reality that's what I'm trying to
[1:01:30] explain a prophet when he sees something
[1:01:31] it's a
[1:01:32] reality he's standing there in his
[1:01:36] message so I've asked you get in that
[1:01:38] message read it read it read it read it
[1:01:41] listen to it it's hard to follow him
[1:01:44] sometimes in the way he's saying
[1:01:52] things but he's standing there talking
[1:01:54] about a
[1:01:56] message well one of these days brother
[1:01:58] brandham you going to bring a
[1:02:01] message
[1:02:04] remember man said to him one day he said
[1:02:07] with your ability you could write a 23rd
[1:02:10] chapter of the Book of
[1:02:12] Revelation he said trying to trap
[1:02:15] me it's because you can't add to the
[1:02:18] word so now he couldn't had to
[1:02:22] Paul right
[1:02:26] here comes a man then that's already
[1:02:29] progressed
[1:02:33] into what he stood and
[1:02:38] said he said Jesus does all three of his
[1:02:42] these in his
[1:02:45] descending in other words he could have
[1:02:47] said if you listen to the message you'll
[1:02:49] hear him say this words but not in out
[1:02:52] of the open to make it to me why because
[1:02:55] it's not to the
[1:02:57] world Amen he's standing there knowing
[1:03:01] that three and a half years before then
[1:03:04] he started a
[1:03:09] message a
[1:03:13] message you know what then that's why he
[1:03:15] could say Jesus is not
[1:03:18] coming he's here to him the Lord Jesus
[1:03:23] descended
[1:03:26] right he was standing there present
[1:03:30] tense 1965 or whatever you want to call
[1:03:37] it knowing the message had already
[1:03:40] come and that a part of the Rapture had
[1:03:43] already
[1:03:50] happened then he turns around and he
[1:03:52] starts speaking of the voice of the
[1:03:55] Archangel and he said the same
[1:03:58] voice that raised
[1:04:03] Lazarus is the voice of the
[1:04:09] Archangel he knew the word he had
[1:04:12] already brought had brought Jesus Christ
[1:04:16] to the
[1:04:18] Earth not in a Corporal body no you
[1:04:22] don't do that until we meet him in the A
[1:04:23] and go to the Millennium right but he'll
[1:04:26] become visible Among Us and raise the
[1:04:29] dead and we go into
[1:04:31] Rapture come
[1:04:33] on he's standing there had already
[1:04:36] walked
[1:04:40] through and probably maybe halfway
[1:04:43] through the sermon he begins to
[1:04:51] realize that the message had already
[1:04:53] been brought
[1:04:57] and in that message is the voice of the
[1:04:59] Archangel there is no voice of the
[1:05:02] Archangel outside the message of the
[1:05:04] word of God what are you looking
[1:05:08] for theor of the Archangel is Jesus
[1:05:11] Christ who's going to raise the dead now
[1:05:13] I know a lot of people's got their ideas
[1:05:15] about raising the dead and who's going
[1:05:17] to do it and what's going to take place
[1:05:19] that's all right that's your
[1:05:21] business I just stay where I've been all
[1:05:23] these years
[1:05:27] were the message if it hasn't brought
[1:05:31] Jesus Christ to
[1:05:33] you that this Prophet brought you need
[1:05:36] to go back and
[1:05:39] listen that's have you ever noticed a
[1:05:42] message brother Brown called
[1:05:44] it raising Jesus from
[1:05:49] history now what does he
[1:05:51] mean raising Jesus from history you mean
[1:05:54] there was a time that the name Jesus
[1:05:56] wouldn't never you wouldn't even used at
[1:05:57] all or anything are we that
[1:06:02] dumb what does it mean raising Jesus
[1:06:04] from history when we took him and made
[1:06:07] him a trinity we made a historical God
[1:06:10] out of
[1:06:12] him and to see him correctly and who he
[1:06:14] really is he's raised from history into
[1:06:18] a
[1:06:23] reality
[1:06:26] the same Lord
[1:06:27] Jesus that spoke back there will be here
[1:06:31] to speak
[1:06:34] again
[1:06:35] right it won't be just you and me folks
[1:06:38] well I've never believed
[1:06:42] that you know a lot of people thought
[1:06:44] boy bless God one of these days I'll say
[1:06:45] it I said you can't say it to you get it
[1:06:49] that's right I said that in 60 something
[1:06:52] 68 I I can still say it today everybody
[1:06:56] saying one of these days we going to
[1:06:58] speak that word I said you can't speak
[1:07:01] it till you get
[1:07:05] it and what I meant then was just what I
[1:07:08] mean now until it becomes a reality of a
[1:07:11] revelation from Hebrews
[1:07:14] 11 the
[1:07:16] substance when brother R said I'm not
[1:07:19] saying he's coming I'm saying the
[1:07:22] substance of all Mighty God outside of
[1:07:25] the Corporal body is on the Earth where
[1:07:27] he was
[1:07:31] at now what about
[1:07:35] it but yet what are we looking for well
[1:07:39] brother so and so is going somebody one
[1:07:40] of
[1:07:44] these everybody's got their own ideas
[1:07:46] ain't
[1:07:49] they but I hope you understand what I
[1:07:51] tried to say tonight
[1:07:55] Paul
[1:07:56] said Jesus Will descend from heaven one
[1:08:00] day and he'll do all three of these
[1:08:01] things he'll bring a message he'll bring
[1:08:04] he'll be the voice of the Archangel and
[1:08:06] he'll sound a
[1:08:09] trumpet it'll carry us out of here call
[1:08:13] us
[1:08:14] up you said no he didn't say it that
[1:08:19] way was that the way brother randam said
[1:08:22] it then that's what Paul
[1:08:26] said right are you listening if that's
[1:08:29] right according to what brother brandham
[1:08:31] say and that's what Paul
[1:08:35] said but it was a
[1:08:39] mystery but there comes a time when all
[1:08:41] Mysteries are
[1:08:43] fulfilled there comes a time when all
[1:08:46] prophecy is
[1:08:51] fulfilled now let me explain a prophecy
[1:08:54] for
[1:08:56] second you know with all of our being
[1:08:59] all of our thinking all of our hopes all
[1:09:01] of our our U
[1:09:05] life is built on one
[1:09:13] thing it's built on whether the sun
[1:09:15] rises tomorrow or
[1:09:22] not
[1:09:24] right you know the sunrising tomorrow is
[1:09:27] a
[1:09:28] prophecy because it's not
[1:09:32] here once it gets here it's
[1:09:35] today you remember what I was trying to
[1:09:37] bring the I am the everpresent for
[1:09:39] eternity all of that you
[1:09:42] know Sister Gil when we step into
[1:09:45] tomorrow and the sun rises and brother G
[1:09:47] dick gets up and he goes down to Hardies
[1:09:50] or Wendy's or wherever he goes
[1:09:54] and gets him a
[1:09:58] biscuit it's
[1:10:01] real but today that's a prophecy that's
[1:10:05] how close we're
[1:10:07] living that's
[1:10:08] right that's how close we're
[1:10:13] living if you're following me the point
[1:10:15] is one
[1:10:17] thing Paul said it brother brandom
[1:10:20] explained what it
[1:10:22] was
[1:10:24] now
[1:10:28] swallow see the day he explained that in
[1:10:33] 1965 you know
[1:10:36] what you and I received a
[1:10:38] prophecy that's
[1:10:41] right of a future
[1:10:43] event
[1:10:45] amen he said how do you why do you say
[1:10:47] that you making it positive you know it
[1:10:50] was positive to
[1:10:52] him
[1:10:54] it wasn't positive to you and
[1:10:56] I so it's a
[1:11:00] prophecy but once it comes off of that
[1:11:02] page into your heart can I quote brother
[1:11:05] brandom it can be questioned as long as
[1:11:07] it lays in the book is that the way he
[1:11:09] said it but he said when it comes off
[1:11:11] them pages into your heart he said it
[1:11:12] can't be questioned no
[1:11:14] more why because you got a
[1:11:18] substance church that's what I've tried
[1:11:20] to preach for 45 years
[1:11:25] the past three months I've dealt more on
[1:11:27] that than
[1:11:29] anything is to try to get you and I to
[1:11:31] see the positive point of where we
[1:11:34] are and that we must see who we are and
[1:11:37] what we're
[1:11:39] doing and not just talk about it and go
[1:11:41] to church and be good and all that's
[1:11:44] wonderful but we done that when we had
[1:11:46] that new birth we done that when we was
[1:11:48] the Baptist the Methodist the
[1:11:50] Presbyterian the things right I didn't
[1:11:54] come in this message to learn not to
[1:11:55] drink alcohol and smoke a
[1:12:00] cigarette this message didn't tell me
[1:12:04] not to Tar down my neighbors pasture
[1:12:11] fence if I tore down his fence and Mama
[1:12:15] found it out I was going to go get the
[1:12:16] cows and put them up and put up the
[1:12:18] fence then I going to get a
[1:12:22] whooping
[1:12:25] right would you see brother Brandon
[1:12:27] people are say brother Brandon brought
[1:12:28] the me boy it brought me from this and
[1:12:30] it brought me from that well amen if it
[1:12:32] did right right I'm not saying that's
[1:12:38] wrong but the new birth ought have took
[1:12:40] care of a lot of
[1:12:45] things there shouldn't be anything in
[1:12:47] the new birth where you talk about
[1:12:48] drinking gambling smoking running around
[1:12:50] with women cussing stuff like there
[1:12:51] shouldn't there shouldn't be anything
[1:12:53] anything that in the New
[1:12:54] Birth even if just Luther's messenger
[1:12:57] the just shall live by
[1:13:02] faith you wouldn't have that he wouldn't
[1:13:04] want to live like the devil and go down
[1:13:05] and pay his Penance that was the things
[1:13:08] he was against when he seen that you I
[1:13:10] shall live by
[1:13:15] faith but are you with
[1:13:18] me resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[1:13:21] places you know that Ephesians 1 and 20
[1:13:24] says that Jesus was raised
[1:13:27] up and sit in Heavenly places at the
[1:13:31] right
[1:13:32] hand
[1:13:35] right the
[1:13:37] power just in the New Birth it brings us
[1:13:46] power just a new
[1:13:48] birth brings us power you shall receive
[1:13:52] power after the Holy Ghost ghost has
[1:13:54] come upon you and you'll be my Witnesses
[1:13:57] no I'm trying to explain it church that
[1:14:01] we look back and say this is that when
[1:14:03] this is not even
[1:14:05] that there was a day when brother randam
[1:14:08] walked out
[1:14:09] there and
[1:14:11] he in that message he probably stopped
[1:14:14] and he says
[1:14:17] Lord the messages already went
[1:14:22] forth
[1:14:24] you know the Lord Jesus one day walked
[1:14:26] into the
[1:14:28] temple took the
[1:14:30] book turned over
[1:14:32] Isaiah he
[1:14:35] read binded up to
[1:14:39] brokenhearted he said this day this
[1:14:43] scripture is fulfilled amen well you
[1:14:47] know what it wasn't fulfilled the day
[1:14:52] before
[1:14:55] right why because it was not a
[1:14:58] possession of Eternity a a revelation
[1:15:01] unto
[1:15:03] him come on you say what well the Bible
[1:15:05] said he grew in Grace and knowledge so
[1:15:07] go
[1:15:08] ahead but listen
[1:15:12] church just because the prophet preached
[1:15:14] it doesn't mean we have it
[1:15:18] right it's when the same God speaks to
[1:15:21] our hearts from what he said
[1:15:28] right God wrote my quoting brother
[1:15:30] brandom God wrote Moses
[1:15:36] interpreted God wrote by Paul brother
[1:15:39] randam interpreted now wait a minute
[1:15:42] wait a minute just don't jump before I
[1:15:44] get through
[1:15:46] okay he couldn't bring anything
[1:15:48] different from the original
[1:15:49] interpretation so he turned us back to
[1:15:51] the original interpretation CU brother
[1:15:53] brandham could not
[1:15:55] interpret it was the Holy Ghost in
[1:15:57] brother brandham that could
[1:16:04] speak that's why like I said when he got
[1:16:06] on the spoken words of Ral seed he was
[1:16:09] out on a limb and stopped in no way that
[1:16:12] he could go any
[1:16:14] further and the Lord said pick up your
[1:16:16] pen and
[1:16:18] right he says as of yet Malachi 4 is not
[1:16:22] fulfilled
[1:16:23] as of
[1:16:25] yet now listening to me I'll quit as of
[1:16:29] yet the message had not progress into
[1:16:31] the position to
[1:16:34] be the shout that Paul
[1:16:42] saw come
[1:16:45] on I believe brother brandom I believe
[1:16:48] what he was doing and he was a prophet
[1:16:50] and nobody stands before a prophet but
[1:16:53] in brother Brown's early Ministry read
[1:16:54] statue of perfect man and see if he
[1:16:57] don't say on it I just got this the
[1:17:00] other day and that's actually added to
[1:17:03] your faith virtue not if you read it so
[1:17:05] you know what the before that other day
[1:17:07] he didn't know
[1:17:10] that but yet go back to uh intervail is
[1:17:14] the old
[1:17:15] title where he said God wants to use
[1:17:19] every being of your fiber he wants to
[1:17:21] feel you he wants you to walk as
[1:17:23] instrumentality of
[1:17:26] Christianity but you see one day it went
[1:17:28] from just being the new
[1:17:31] birth and he started teaching the statue
[1:17:33] of a perfect man Faith virtue knowledge
[1:17:35] temper coming up but then one
[1:17:38] day when he had gotten that done because
[1:17:41] that was what was written in the Bible
[1:17:43] the faith of the
[1:17:45] fathers and when that was
[1:17:47] completed then the Lord says Malachi 4
[1:17:50] is not
[1:17:52] fulfilled
[1:17:53] three and a half years later he's
[1:17:55] standing preaching or somewhere
[1:18:00] thereabouts and he said the Lord has
[1:18:02] descended from
[1:18:05] heaven with a
[1:18:08] shout Jesus has done all three of these
[1:18:10] here in his
[1:18:12] descending we see we're still looking
[1:18:14] out
[1:18:15] there that's all I've tried to
[1:18:18] say what you think about me forget it
[1:18:21] just take what say it
[1:18:24] my whole life has been based on not
[1:18:27] what's out
[1:18:30] there I get sick and tired of people
[1:18:33] talking about what's
[1:18:36] coming I know there's things to come
[1:18:40] yes but when all you preach is things to
[1:18:42] come things to come one day one
[1:18:47] day I've got it already there we'll pick
[1:18:49] it up Sunday where brother around
[1:18:51] says our problem we're living below our
[1:18:57] privilege what is our privilege to know
[1:19:00] that these things has already
[1:19:02] happened and US believe it amen to know
[1:19:07] that the word has done been brought to
[1:19:09] you and
[1:19:10] I are we looking for another Prophet to
[1:19:16] come what are we looking
[1:19:18] for someone to straighten out
[1:19:21] everything I found anything need to be
[1:19:24] straightened myself I've been at it 40
[1:19:27] something years and I've put out the
[1:19:29] challenge they put it all out to the
[1:19:30] people do right R around made these
[1:19:32] mistakes R around I challenge anybody in
[1:19:34] the world come show me where he made a
[1:19:40] mistake now don't be stupid or
[1:19:44] silly like I told sister Barbara's
[1:19:46] husband that day when he told me there
[1:19:48] was contradictions in the Bible I said
[1:19:50] please don't be cuz it's a verse very
[1:19:53] intelligent man he is and I said please
[1:19:56] don't be to the point of saying they was
[1:19:59] two Blind Men and there was one blind
[1:20:02] man which one is it one or
[1:20:07] two I said was two different men writing
[1:20:10] and what they
[1:20:12] saw
[1:20:14] oh I don't mean he's dumb he's very very
[1:20:17] intelligent intelligent intelligent man
[1:20:19] but his point was that David had one
[1:20:23] scripture said he had 4,000 chariots and
[1:20:26] the other scripture said he had 40,000
[1:20:28] chariots which one did he have I said he
[1:20:31] had
[1:20:31] 40,000 he had 36 of them in one place
[1:20:34] and 4,000 in the other
[1:20:40] one I said don't be silly with
[1:20:45] contradictions that's not contradictions
[1:20:47] that's different people
[1:20:51] writing show me where brother Brandon
[1:20:53] was contrary to the Bible am that's
[1:20:55] right
[1:20:58] amen cuz our only hope is that he was
[1:21:04] right come on we've walked away from
[1:21:06] organized religion right do we claim
[1:21:08] that we claim we come out of
[1:21:09] denominations and this and that and the
[1:21:11] other and we' walked away from them and
[1:21:13] don't want to go
[1:21:14] back that's
[1:21:17] right well then we've got all our hopes
[1:21:19] based on one thing amen if read a right
[1:21:23] somebody better get here in a hurry
[1:21:25] that's right
[1:21:27] am oh
[1:21:34] my I like what brother randam said when
[1:21:37] he was talking about Peter and him
[1:21:38] saying this is that or one to them or
[1:21:42] Peter said it I think this is that it
[1:21:44] was spoken of he said if this ain't that
[1:21:47] let me keep this till that gets
[1:21:50] here well for 45 or almost 50 years now
[1:21:55] I've pressed one thing get
[1:21:58] ready that's it we got to be ready for
[1:22:02] what's
[1:22:05] coming we're not changed yet we look at
[1:22:08] each other no problem with
[1:22:12] it so then there's something to
[1:22:16] come but if we're not standing here
[1:22:18] ready what's coming will do us no
[1:22:21] good right we we got to know what's
[1:22:27] coming you think the devil ain't going
[1:22:29] to try to impersonate
[1:22:33] everything my Lord I told him that 40
[1:22:36] something years ago I said the devil's
[1:22:38] going to do everything he can to
[1:22:40] impersonate the things brother brandom
[1:22:42] talked
[1:22:44] about in his
[1:22:48] ministry
[1:22:51] well
[1:22:54] you better believe one thing if God
[1:22:55] starts moving Satan
[1:23:01] moves cuz he's got to throw off I had
[1:23:05] one in here I'll get back to it Sunday
[1:23:06] where brother around said discrediting
[1:23:08] God's word that Satan's
[1:23:12] attacked he said when the bride realizes
[1:23:14] who she is and what she's here far Satan
[1:23:18] will be powerless before
[1:23:21] her
[1:23:24] of course we don't need to study the
[1:23:25] message we just wait brother so and so
[1:23:28] come along somebody come along and
[1:23:29] explain it to us when we what's he going
[1:23:32] to explain to
[1:23:33] you if you don't
[1:23:38] know and how are you going to know where
[1:23:40] brother R said it or
[1:23:42] not it's like the brother he said told
[1:23:45] me
[1:23:46] Sunday the HEK
[1:23:48] there I gave it to you excuse me I gave
[1:23:50] a book I need keep that one brother
[1:23:53] Paul the Black Brothers just been here
[1:23:56] two or three
[1:23:57] times I supposed to give it to him but
[1:23:59] you can have that I'll give him
[1:24:02] another cuz Hank wants him
[1:24:05] too but I told him I
[1:24:09] said what do you think you know he said
[1:24:12] listen he said while you was preaching
[1:24:14] said I sat there and my wife saw him
[1:24:16] counting or somebody did somebody told
[1:24:17] me sister Anna so I'm counting and I
[1:24:21] said you know you got seven
[1:24:24] ads you better look add to your faith
[1:24:27] virture don't add Faith cuz he make
[1:24:29] eight add to your fa said he was sitting
[1:24:31] there counting well you know what it
[1:24:33] meant something he said I'd like to have
[1:24:36] that book he said because I believe the
[1:24:38] Lord spoke to me about something that we
[1:24:41] need to grow up in
[1:24:44] that that we start at the
[1:24:46] bottom I
[1:24:49] thought I know people that's been in
[1:24:51] this message 50 years that don't know
[1:24:58] that come on musicians let's
[1:25:01] stand listen church I know I've been
[1:25:04] horrible everything in the world but I
[1:25:06] ain't one
[1:25:08] thing I drive for one thing if it's
[1:25:11] drive if it's for hard for me to drive
[1:25:13] I'll
[1:25:15] drive to try my best to pound it into
[1:25:18] you and
[1:25:20] I I'm not looking for the Lord to come
[1:25:23] I'm looking at his
[1:25:27] coming I'm not looking for a message to
[1:25:32] come I've heard the message that has
[1:25:38] come I know where the Archangel is
[1:25:43] at he's on
[1:25:46] Earth and it's Jesus
[1:25:48] Christ Living in his people right and
[1:25:53] the trumpet is simply taking us up the
[1:25:57] calling
[1:25:58] upward the
[1:26:03] trumpet when are we going to see that
[1:26:05] those things had already taken
[1:26:08] place but yet we're still looking for it
[1:26:11] well I don't see this and I don't see
[1:26:13] that that's why for years
[1:26:17] folks used a brother used to come
[1:26:20] here and all he done was went around and
[1:26:23] wrote articles and things and I'm not
[1:26:25] against him I loved him do anything I
[1:26:27] did for him anything in the world for
[1:26:32] him but I beg God to please not do
[1:26:35] nothing while he was
[1:26:37] here you say brother
[1:26:40] Dale I know it I'm
[1:26:42] sorry well I begged him I said God don't
[1:26:45] do nothing when that man is here because
[1:26:46] if you do he's going to announce to the
[1:26:48] world this that or the other and it
[1:26:50] won't be on account of the word I said
[1:26:52] people to start flocking into here just
[1:26:54] because of something that that's
[1:26:55] happened the Dead's raised the sick
[1:26:56] healed this that and the
[1:26:58] other I said don't do it while is's
[1:27:03] here he said you're I know it I'm
[1:27:07] sorry but I believe one
[1:27:10] thing I believe God has Vindicated
[1:27:14] through right here in this little church
[1:27:17] building all we have need of to believe
[1:27:20] a Rapture is in process
[1:27:23] cuz we've seen the sick healed we've
[1:27:25] seen the dead raised that's what Paul
[1:27:27] asked me in the office he said you said
[1:27:30] you had seen the dead raised I said yes
[1:27:32] sir of five or six times we've seen it
[1:27:36] he said you mean literally raised I said
[1:27:40] yes
[1:27:41] sir he said I thought you was just
[1:27:44] talking about spiritually raised or
[1:27:46] something you know that we raised up and
[1:27:48] the dead that Sinners had raised up
[1:27:50] become Christians I said no no we have
[1:27:53] seen the dead
[1:27:57] raised but you don't have to worry about
[1:28:00] now it ain't go it go out on the world
[1:28:02] the
[1:28:03] internet if it went out years ago they'd
[1:28:05] have flocked in here but it won't now my
[1:28:08] people's already got their mind
[1:28:13] set they've already got it set on this
[1:28:17] what they
[1:28:21] believe and you know what they
[1:28:25] say well the Bible
[1:28:28] says if a man give you a sign and it
[1:28:32] come to
[1:28:34] pass and he takes you to another God
[1:28:37] don't believe
[1:28:40] him and that Lula church is trying to
[1:28:43] carry you to another God because we
[1:28:46] believe in two Lords Two Souls seven
[1:28:49] Thunder
[1:28:50] virtues you know
[1:28:53] River Jordans and we're taking you to
[1:28:55] this God they're taking you to another
[1:28:57] God don't worry about it it ain't going
[1:28:58] to build this church it ain't going to
[1:29:00] fill it
[1:29:02] up if I thought that we'd already have a
[1:29:07] 500,000 seat
[1:29:11] capacity but I know we're not going to
[1:29:13] need what we
[1:29:17] got because some are not going to be
[1:29:21] able to stand just slowly
[1:29:24] grinding and they'll find some excuse
[1:29:27] for
[1:29:33] leaving what is it go ahead brother 194
