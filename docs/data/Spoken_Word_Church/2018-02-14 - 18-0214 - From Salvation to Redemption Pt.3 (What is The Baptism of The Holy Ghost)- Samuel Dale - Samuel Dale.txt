a good time together and that's just a good time all right so remember that right if you were there 10 years ago you're hearing it 10th anniversary this will be the tenth year that we're going with it

have any father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for your love and understanding thank you for you and we just ask you to God us an understanding of thy word if we speak tonight about you and Father forgive our sins because we know that we fail you constantly so cleanse us Lord and make us to be what you want us to be and guide each one of us in your loving grace in God as Lord in what we would say because in that that we say is very vital to the point of what we're talking about so just have your way and keep us in Jesus name Amen so we'll go to Jonah 2 and none but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord seasons 1 verse 4 according has he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had to bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven in which our own earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth now remember after you hear the truth they took that on over into acts and all weathers right all the Scriptures alright after that you have heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation now what's their title so we've spent 10 12 15 20 messages on salvation now we're on what from salvation to Redemption alright so what's he saying if you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom I also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise now what is that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory amen you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word alright now say in our title is showing what we're talking about we're talking about now coming from salvation all the Old Testament is a background everything sitting in the Old Testament in that line as a background all right coming into the New Testament coming into Redemption alright because that's dealing with it the Old Testament had no new birth they did not have eternal life in their soul in the Old Testament we've been through John and and Adam so alright we've covered that okay yeah but then coming to a point of redemption and coming to the place that Jesus Christ prayed to price that we could be redeemed alright then this Redemption we're reading on over that it even goes to that what the what you receive as the new birth as being just an earnest of your full Redemption which will be the redeeming of these bodies ohright to take us in a rapture and then you'll see and then you can truly say at that point I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that'll be finished it will all be done won't be anything and it'll be laid in that order the Prophet said on blasphemous names he said that the baptism has been taught of the Holy Spirit but he said it's been taught incorrectly all right now what does it mean to teach something incorrectly it means you just you can totally go the opposite direction are you conducing but all you got to do is slide a little idea or a thought into something and it'll change it from what you are trying to say all right as an example listen to these statements today and then I'll repeat them Sunday and whenever I preach them over and over and over I'll keep repeating them caught a one held in your mind you remember they thought we were carrying Sunday that the Bible in the writing of the Bible it's written to her yes it can be it has compound meaning compound revelation all right but remember it cannot have contrary revelations all right it can be you know compound meaning two meanings or something to pick up a natural or a spiritual but it cannot have that the Bible can't be telling you of Jesus Christ and then some great revelation of the devil you know or Satan because that would not be correct the Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ the Prophet said if you don't see Christ in ever verse he didn't say if you didn't see Christ in 1 the devil in another one and all this other sure the opening of the word exposes the devil but remember the opening of the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ so what's going to expose the devil the revelation of Jesus Christ all right so now we'll keep saying that until we get the thought in our mind but remember the Bible is written then straight across now watch what I'm saying now the Bible is written straight across thank God that he sent us a prophet because that prophet can come down underneath maybe is not a good way of saying it but best I got it can come down into the word and he can show you the things you know that we knew some of it because it was written in the word like I'll bring my son out of Egypt and then Jesus Christ that's that's fine but the rest of the word see it comes to the Prophet when he says this is what that is the word he means if there's any way of going down he's starting at the earnest and the way I always preached it's always been that way if you ever noticed it when I start a topic I go to the I don't know what you call it bottom or the lowest I go down to where you start the earnest or something most everybody jumps up here to the headstone of it and or the top of it and goes with that you know no I have to start at the bottom and come up because that way I know I've got an anchor that once I reach the apex of what I'm talking about that I don't worry about what somebody says because I've already covered that come on so what about well we'll go back to message number three eight nine ten messages ago and you'll hear that I explained that see that way I can can bring out that point and how that thought but remember then the Prophet the Bible is written it wasn't written over there words talking about Jesus coming and then turned around and wrote behind that and talked about well one of these is Jesus and the other one is Israel now that was back over in the word that was down into the parts of the word that was not to the top echelon the top Salon is Jesus Christ are you with me I mean that's the way I've always studied the Bible and that way then you don't get confused then you say what is love well you got to get so much love down here when you get the Newburgh you get so much love but that's an earnest compared to the love that comes forth all right so the Bible is written at the top all right now here's what we're saying so in the Bible that makes it confusing to mankind because in the stature of a perfect man in Peter by the Prophet explaining it you can start at faith and how the new birth all right then you can grow in grace and knowledge up the stature of a perfect man and come out to where it says Holy Spirit which would be the faith of the father's because that's what they had and then it goes on to the apex of the headstone which is the completion of the baptism of the Holy Spirit if you study the Bible that was very simple it brings everything to an opening that then you can read the Bible and see well this year we're speaking of that the Old Testament is one Thompson shatters speaking of bringing my son out of Egypt in the natural we're speaking of the apex of the finished product of Jesus Christ's coming if you study the Bible from that it'll line up beautiful and then you won't be confused you remember what we were bringing out the other day now just trying to get this point because I know lately of what I'm doing this driving drop points huh I want to get this to you you remember how we were bringing out the last message we went from the future home where brother Branham said that he had always taught those three stages of grace he said from the beginning as a boy well brother Dale I can show you where he taught us over here and he talked this over here and like he talked us know you just use the word that I'm glad you you it looks like he see you you've got Kotler see when you say it looks like this is his son he looks like that it's I know in the Bible that no look like that that's what I just got through saying it ain't look like that me or what the Prophet say about it you know it can't be no different okay now listen to the point I'm trying to get to to give you an illustration because we're going to need this value value it would be very valuable when we continue a few more messages all right now to show you how that we're going to have to listen to the Prophet and let him explain all right now he believed in his early part of his ministry and coming up he believed the evidence that he he came down to finally a point he believed in the gifts he believed in all of the things he said you can't do away with the the you know the the love the joy the peace the goodness and thing he would have that is an evidence then he would have he never did take tongs as evidenced but he did say you can speak in tongues while you haven't it come forth right he didn't annihilate it he just put it in the right order alright so in his evidence he would start down here now listen what I'm saying he would start at a lower earnest to understanding of the gifts the thing and then he finalized it by coming up to saying what now you need these weakens get him in a hurry he finally he come up and he said well brother and I were talking and said we we settled on the point of saying that it was love do you remember that huh you know that's true it is love now get what I'm saying he said on the future home that he taught the three processes what justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said he never changed I'm just illustrating the way that he went through things that looks like he changed but yet he didn't change he groped in development all right so he would start out as the gifts of saying well okay it's it's you know love joy peace goodness and time and that's true that still it's true then he would come up to a position of saying well okay we'll settle at this by saying it's love well you know it's true that's true all right but then he finally want the Holy Ghost are the angel of the Lord straightened him out on that he said and said it has to do with receiving the word you remember that all right now did that change him to work that he needed to go back and preach well I was wrong here I said it was love I was wrong here when I said it was the fruit of the Spirit I was wrong here and said did you have to go back and preach that why because those things were right it is the fruits of the spirit it is love with the fine Alice is a capstone head part of it comes out it to be what the opening of the word right whether or not the spirit and you can agree with the word all right don't forget this I'll repeat it don't forget it but I'll repeat it don't worry about it I won't let you forget it okay what about in his years now that we've just finished the series just recently that we went through months and months and months and and all talking of about we're brother branham in his early ministry basically now not every time basically the basics of his early ministry was what that man was a triune being but he would bring him body soul and spirit that's the basics now I didn't say all the time I said basics that's where he described it no we can give you that we've been over it we can give it to you where he brains it as the triune being of a man being body soul and spirit but then when he strikes along right in the 63-64 especially and drops into 65 after the opening of the seals there in 63 what does he say he said he's a tri own big he said he's body spirit and soul right but he never preached a message at least I've never seen it or what ever heard it he never preached a message saying I was wrong back there I was wrong when I was saying body soul and spirit and putting a sinner real as the spirit see when he finally finishing it up he put the soul as a sin around and i preached that over to you for 40 years what then he didn't have to straighten nothing out because that was right because the soul is the nature of the Spirit and the Spirit is the nature of the soul so it's interchangeable to be able to be used and mankind through brother branham coming down you know you didn't don't have to check all this out but you can if you want to but a lot of it wound up being called solis doctrine and it wound up being that man did not have a soul until the law came into being that was the denominational doctrine and see then that soul they didn't make it to real thing okay are you following the net so brother branham could come in to his ministry and as he progressed and the opening of the word he would grow from the evidence and the Holy Ghost being love joy peace good up to love and other thing and then finalize it by making the apex of all of it as to whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word all right so he would be on the soul in the spirit and interchangeable up and down through the early ministry coming on up then he comes into the sixty three four or five specially about four and five because the Bible says that Hebrews 4:12 the word is sharper than a two-edged sword dividing the soul and spirit join the Mara so it took the opening of the seals to bring the prophet to the revelation to finalize it as an apex that her own being is a body spirit and soul baba he could preach the anointed ones now come on we're in the message right the anointed ones are anointed were what did your prophet say they were anointed but on their spirit now what if he had to preach that message in his early ministry when he was saying the spirit was the inner realm of you okay I'm not trying to correct I'm trying to show you that he said it he done it and see then you'll see this when you get into it that he taught the three stages of grace justification same case the baptism I'll go all the way through his whole ministry right now we're in this part so I want to do it I had left off the brothers we laughed about it Kota when I came today brother Joe came in and he said we starting on number four he said I thought maybe I missed it if you look on your notes you got number four words the first one and I said well see I had moved some things around and put reposition and thing no way they're not handing them a piece of paper I said here's wine yours one two three because I got it after coming here as to bring it together and put it in order now listen what about your prophet teaching justification of saint christian - baptism of the holy ghost and that teaching it as the new birth yet they seems to be a lot of quotes in his early ministry that looked like argues to the point of what he's saying but remember he said he taught it from the beginning so that means we're misunderstanding when he say it is that right now we're misunderstanding because he said he told it that don't matter even if he says it exactly the way that it looks like it said to be wrong if he taught it from the beginning and didn't change something happened our understanding all right so now watch what I'm getting at I want to read three things in it and they can pull up and I think I gave them the wrong one on one of them but listen what about brother Branham always teaching three stages to the birth what about him always teaching the new birth the born to gain experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the one in the same I know you automatically I know out there you automatically your mind is gonna run yeah but I got a quote here I got a quote diagon quote then you're saying he's wrong in the future all okay you're saying he's wrong now does that make you greater than him then we need to follow you that's no sarcastic that's just truth but listen what if I can read three things to before the opening of the word in the seals in one after and show you that he's taught the same thing all the way then whatever you pick up the old ministries in it everything you got to remember it's gonna have to have a place to line up now I've trying to tell you what I've said it and I mean it seriously this is the hardest message I've ever tried to preach it's the most bearing up on me mentally because I know in the next message or two I'm gonna have to say things that seems to be totally incorrect I can read you a quote that goes this way and read you a quote he goes that way but remember I don't care if that goes that way and that'n goes that away the apex of the entire message is what three works of grace are three stages not three works it's three stages of grace all right justification the same case in the baptismal holy God so then the baptism of the holy ghost is gonna have to be to word that we can follow it all the way through the message so in nineteen and fifty seven I hope we got these right I can we can swap over though pull-up number one which would be 1957 I hope I gave it to you in the right order which is a message called life they've brought a random priest 1957 602 so keeping the dates in your mind in a paragraph and if it's not there then I'll give them the other one but II 42 all right 1957 joining church won't do it no sir that's the only perverting the real cause you mean he didn't want search membership oh come on if the devil can't get you out on those things he will take you to this other all right so don't settle for nothing less than an old-fashioned experience of the new birth to be born again of the spirit of the eternal God when your soul and God locks together and you become one so that's what is it new birth born again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost are the spirit he puts them all in one paragraph what about that was 1957 now remember he can't change his doctrine okay I don't know where this will come up to the right one or not brother but it on 60 let C be hearing recognizing acting on the Word of God Jeffersonville Indiana and I don't know if that one comes up and not will try to fit it in I gave them three and I gave them one extra one that's me my problem but listen 19 and 60 2:21 hearing recognizing acting on the Word of God now everyone knows that the seal of God is the birthright the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 saying grieve not the Spirit of God were by your seal till the day of your redemption when they were born again they were filled with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the new birth you know that you begat another spirit you admit it okay what are you getting new birth born again experience baptism of the Holy Ghost all in the same paragraph okay okay let's go over to God's provided way but surely they have this one number three priests in Bakersfield California 19 in 64 okay that's why man out to be today now he heard it in by some denominational coupe but come in the way God said come in by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the new earth swarming warm swarming revival not Church joining solicited from door to door and passed out magazines but a birth being born again filled with the Holy Ghost God's Way freeing himself from the world all right there's a 57 19 and 60 and a 64 okay it all gives the new birth the born-again experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one in the sign now this is the apex this is the finality this is the future home the city taught three processes justification of sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost you say yeah but now you're yeah I'm using exactly right the new birth the baptism with the Holy Ghost and the born-again experience are one in the sign and we're going to read where the prophet said it can't be no other way we're going to read where he said this stuff says and Lord okay but then we're going to have to drop back and we're gonna pick up some statements that are going to sound like that you know what I'm going to read what he says cuz that way you can't argue with me if I read what he say it okay that's kind of like that brother that they got onto him back a few years ago because of using like a word colored or something like that well then he proved the point was that he was reading what brother Branham said it wouldn't him making the statement out over the internet you know of saying colored or black or whatever we'll see they couldn't argue the point because here's a man back in the 50s that is reading from in the 50s it was colored you see you get the point alright now my point tonight is for one time the scriptures is written in a way that it has a total apex of entirety and that's what it's saying now listen I want you to raise your hand if you think you can find it good I'd like to read it you know to see well I'd like for you to think about a situation that is it anywhere in the Bible anywhere in the scripture in the prophets message that the Prophet would ever give an altar call and say I want you to come up here to get justified are you listening a lot of people came up and got that but I think the point the point is the the the altar call we've read from the Prophet will reread it tonight he said he gave an altar call for people to come and receive the baptism of the holy spirit which was exactly like Pentecost he said but they thought that it already had this or that or the other but show me any Scripture in the Bible even the thoughts on that scripture that would rate relate to the point that Peter or any of them ever gave an of altar call to come and repent or to come to be justified sanctified in anything you know no it was always to come and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth or the born-again experience you know one of those can be in the scripture here another one in scripture there whatever but get what I'm saying but around them never made a altar call I want y'all to come up here and get justified yet we know a lot did nothing gonna do with it I'm saying what he's saying he's going the apex the height he said come and receive the baptism of the holy spirit now watch him right here's where he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Spirit at faith no the baptism of the Holy Ghost the day of Pentecost is what we're going to be dealing with we're not going to be dealing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the headstone or thoughts race that out it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost the faith of the fathers that will be the next parts and thoughts in our mind all right so you fathered me that you want me to repeat it again there's no word that you'd find an altar call by the Prophet and I've never done it myself all right now I want y'all to come down here and I want y'all to just to repent I don't say that would you if you were up here I'd ask you to come and receive the baptism in the Holy College it may be all you get is repentance but that's your choice they were never an altar call in the Bible the Apostles or whatever we're gonna read what your prophet said let's see if it's wrong you see that's why it's so hard to preach the truth because so many people have already in their mind so many and I don't agree with the brother told brother mote years ago then brother motive said something to me one day and I won't call the others names but he had said something about getting the people to stay he said you get them people reading it in books and they'll know more about it and you do I want you to know more about it and I did I want you to read more than I did I want you to study more than I did because then there's one thing for sure when I make the statement brother Branham made you will know the statement is right and I don't have to explain then the statement because you'll know it I love to preach to people that are well-read yet I admit that it's easier to preach to people who know nothing to go to Africa right today and stand up and preach to a congregation of Baptists Methodists or whatever they were would be easier than try to preacher tonight it would be nothing is tiring upon the body to try to remember and try to say things in their own way and church has burdened me hard I said something to my wife the other day and I apologized to her about it I don't make excuses but I just do make it the truth I've never been one that was nervous whatever but if we don't get out of here pretty quick folks we're in bad shape one way or the other right because we're getting older well if I hurt your feelings or say something in some way that offends you or something I'm sorry but I'm trying my best to tell the truth I know it's made me is I'm just like that I know it because it's just you know that we ain't got time to play around now let me say it to you in the right way many of you have said over the years to me brother Dale we need to be we need preaching about the new birth we need to preaching about salvation and yet you go out into these things what I'm trying to preach salvation this simple this can be now you want me to go out on something else because I'm burdensome to you and telling the truth about it well I'm sorry that's just me okay now think about this the Prophet said that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not correctly called he said people say I believe the baptism he said he said that's like a car and things like that he said they spark plugs points in time he said but when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot he said goes with it so you go to a Pentecostal church tonight and you say oh do you believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen you want to walk right over here to the badness I'm not throwing no stones I'm talking you want to walk to a Baptist Church Methodist Church whatever and say do you believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but one guy that when they believe one shouted one cried one Biff one that is that your prophet but listen it's always been the Holy Spirit go in the church age book and pull it up and they'll say the Holy Spirit is makes the Holy Ghost by things that only fear in every age it's a title of a section of it and we'll read statements of this one day when we get a same Holy Ghost justified to Luther sanctified immense this baptized up kind of call same Holy Ghost he said the Holy Ghost in this age hold it goes in this age holding those knee say okay it was the word that was eighth down that was a favorite statement of my wife years ago it's been the word this watchman ate down not the Holy Spirit there's no such thing is taking away the Holy Spirit you'd have to take a candle out so no I say stuff like that and you think I'm arrogant and hateful I'll take it but he said then when the Holy Spirit this is off the message why is it that so many Christians find it hard to live the Christian life and did when the Holy Spirit comes down and says now let's read it here that we're we're um yeah we need to bring need to bring it up to y'all but down to us all right listen he talks about an old rawhide you know when talking about putting new wine in old bottles in the skins okay if you say the baptism of the holy spirit was promised onto their Pentecost to you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call the old dry skin just burst open they don't believe it right and you lose your sermon I like that that's right it doesn't do any good and I'm ashamed that Pentecostal skins are drying like that that's right come back to the word now listen notice now a new skin he said the new wine is put in the new bottles and the new skin has all in it flexible and then when the Holy Spirit comes down and says now when the Holy Spirit comes down and says the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same today as it ever was in other words we have no right to disbelieve that or discount down or try to figure it out I said well I believe it's over there I believe this happen anyway that's exactly right when the Holy Spirit comes down and says it you can't argue right divine healing is the same as it ever was the new wine begins to spread the word is preached in its power but are you listening it's been a Holy Ghost in every age always has been the Holy Ghost and always will be the Holy Ghost all right now we're going to start reading that we're going to read if you didn't have your notes you don't we'll follow it from here I want to read this tonight together if nothing else I've preached parts of it and trying to get you to think on it but listen all right go ahead and we'll start on number six yeah you got it okay this'll be one page 144 from the Summerlin Church eight it'll go 20:44 145 146 147 and 148 a continual reading all right now what he says in here we must take code I know what you'll do I know what most people do I don't believe in the church age book okay so you're out so you they believe in the church age move you're in what we're talking about then I want you to show me where the church age looks wrong that's all I've ever say it now so you can see now in okay that we cannot afford to say what the Bible has not said when the scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age all right then we didn't know that the Spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive that fruit for that time amen that's exactly correct what did he say he said if you didn't have it every way he put a misinterpretation to it and go off into sin that's in the church he's booked up oh brother Larry my car shaking his head uh-huh go me and him used to talking about the church age book back when I first come into message you know you know you live that church age booth okay now listen so we're going up to number two then we'll go three and like four I think and it was young when it's emerging church age or the church age book page 144 now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is according to the word it is not according to me it is not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the Lord are we are falsely led now I think I think that's a pretty good apex don't you I think that's a pretty good top apex top so anything else that's down underneath there is going to have to line up to come out to the right thing but it's a pretty good apex to somebody say thus saith the Lord as a matter of fact we were listening to really Vale the other night on the internet if you've on the internet you got a lot of testimonies on our you ought to go in there and pull them up and read listen to it and he was talking about this very point that wrote a random told him said in other words put it there he made this statement something about he said you've got it right put it in there and evidently he must have been arguing the point but I think I don't worry about it that's business but listen it has to be according to the cell order we're falsely laying now come on to begin with you will notice that in my meetings when I finished preaching and an evangelistic --all now I'll try to this run-through feist on this and you read but I asked them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I am inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost now listen to it because they are already born again now he's asking them to come be baptized with the Holy Ghost but they're putting in their saying something they're all thinking it's already born again they're putting it wrong all right so when I invite those who are spirit filled to come and deal with those who have answered invitation to receive the Holy Spirit these dear one search for word and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speaking in speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion now I want to make I want to tell you exactly what I mean that's a pretty good statement what does he mean when he gives an altar call they misunderstand and think he's doing this and they need to incur speaking talk he didn't say that he said I'm sure I'll give the altar call to come and be baptized with the Holy Spirit okay I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again remember the statement hook oh butter I've never made a statement I've got the altar open tonight for them that needs to be justified y'all come on get justified and then we'll put you over here let's get sanctified they'll put you over no you always say it come and receive the new birth the morning experience or the baptism of the Holy Ghost one of the three statements will be made okay I mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again listen what is to be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost that's your born-again experience what Jesus was teaching just by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched men and brethren what once we do to be saved well you need to come down here and get justified you need to come here where pray for you get sanctified they had to go through that but that question was not asked meaning brother what must we do to we say repeat every one and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ for efficiency and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that puts justification sanctification to baptism Holy Ghost in line but you're not giving out a call for that you're giving out a call for the new birth or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the born-again experience exactly what took place is Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born to the Spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it's one and the same okay now when we get over to saying this about the new birth and this about the born-again experience I will reread that where you won't forget okay because you know those statements were brother Brennan said I can conclusively prove that you're born again and baptized into the body I say that is 1000% correct but it sure does sound a lot it sure does sound wrong don't it agreed where he said you begin your eternal life right here at the altar but any turns around says you don't get any turtle out till you get the baptism in the Holy Spirit the two statements of both of them's right that's the simplicity of the message in our if you put it in simplicity now we're reading on see we're going up to number four partner someone I realized that it's going to be confusing for a moment here as most people know that I was ordained a Baptist preacher and I have steadfastly to declare that the Baptist's have missed it by saying you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe for that is not so you receive him since you believe in us that and deliver receive the Holy Ghost since you believe and they said unto Him we have not so much as heard whether they're being able to go how was he baptized and all to go and keep coming up there it is Paul asked have you received the Holy have you received since not when you believe and there is a great difference there for it is after we believe that we receive that will be the answer to why a lot of it looks contrary one to the other you'll remember those statements then whom also after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation whom also after you believed not when you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise we just read that scripture there is my point to many of our modernistic and even our fundamentalist so-called now this is what they believe believe it the salvation that is first certain specific time which in many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ are being born again hmm now watching this that's their statement here's his statement all right are you reading that's their statement here's his statement read it they making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again that's their statements now to receive Christ is to receive his spirit to receive his Spirit is to be born again to receive His Spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen these folks believe that is wonderful but they stop there you receive the Holy Ghost after you believed it was always been that has always been that way and always will be the very first word of direction to the people was by Peter at Pentecost and he said repent I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ promises through the urine to your children the Lord our God shall call now we're going to know we're getting paid 145 we're doing good these direction came at direct answer from Peter relative to what he had actually what had actually happened at Pentecost what came to Pais was that God according to Joel what came to pass at Pinnacle was what according to Joel was pouring out the promise of the Holy Spirit upon all flesh he was not poured out before that time are given before that time this was it but this was to come from now on by repeating the in baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God was duty-bound to the ones who came Peter now listen are any of the Apostles never saying you must be born again and then fill with the Holy Spirit we're going to read statements where brother Brown looks like he says some contrary but remember this is the apex he said well these others could be over here and it's gonna be with I argue of it you won't never get to her because you ain't gonna keep you three stages together you're never gonna keep justification the same case in the baptism of Holy Ghost running in the correct line if you don't approach it correctly you'll never get the born-again experience the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be one in the same if you don't keep it correctly okay so he said none of the Apostles never said it okay where we at well 1:45 let's go we got to 146 yeah 145 145 1 146 this is a continuation now that this is the pattern of experience relating to receiving the Holy Spirit notice carefully the very next time that the spirit fell upon the people now this is Acts and Philip when a Samaria you know and their priests crossing to them and and that the Philip came and they've got all the things rolled I don't know you can read your scriptures and know that it's true just keep on going do we get to the yellow part come on up or y'all going down we say up y'all go down every what it takes to get it go that away who when they were come down they thought Peter John and then you read your scriptures in between prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost you remember one of those time in there that may be the one you remember one of them in there they couldn't get the Holy Ghost to come on to people they had to send for Peter was it Peter and John they sent for they said for two of the others to come and they came down and prayed for him the ghosts came home they must have been a little something that wasn't exactly right now I don't know what it was but there was something he didn't come on them but these two came he came on them you came said just the body because these others is trying to get him they was in the body too maybe they didn't understand the new birth exactly maybe they were trying to say you spoke in tongues you just how did you believe this may be a okay don't he'd fallen upon none of them only they were baptized to the name of the Lord Jesus he laid hands on them they received according to verse 12 they believe the word they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but according to verse 16 in spite of all that they had still not received the Holy Spirit it was only after believing in being baptized correctly did they receive the Holy Ghost this is the exact pattern as set forth by Peter in acts 2:38 and 39 which this means under day of Pentecost I like these right come on move it on you can get your scriptural reading in between now by me by no means now listen you find out and read your scripture because that's what he's talking about now by no means can it be said that the blessings of Abraham I remember we discussed this in the Baptist Church okay that she had two blessings of Abraham and it on the Gentiles and you had to the Jews were their part we discussed that in the Baptist Church I remember that now by no means can it be said that the blessings of Abraham is the new birth and that the promise of the Spirit is the baptism with the Holy Ghost as two separate events I remember that was discussed in the Baptist Church but it was at the Holy Ghost Gentiles and things all right we'll see watch Beth now by no means can it be said that the blessing of Abraham is the new earth and that the promise of the Spirit is the baptism of the Holy Ghost as two separate events for the scripture does reach Jesus died on the cross and by means of that death and resurrection the blessings of Abraham came on the Gentiles leaving the Jews this transpired in order that the spirit might become available to the Gentile continue on I want to get these read 147 still in the smyrna church a to understand what i have just said is to clear up one students have never found you just have never found paul saying at any time be born again and then be spirit filled you can't find it he's teaching you born again any teaching your spirit filled and then this that or the other up and down he's teaching the overhead straight across listen they haven't fared it to be though it is dire and they have put their own meaning to make it say it but scripture does not say that jesus never said it either and he goes into john and you read that john and all with this fake now that's the warrant this spake he of the holy spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost had not come yet not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified let me start right here to say something you know that's an argument among the people of this message used to be in the seventies that Holy Ghost with one thing the Holy Spirit was another thing okay I don't believe it now it says here that distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinkin by coming unto Jesus in faith would have rivers of living waters pouring out of him and it places that experience at Pentecost come on up we're getting to the point of real same living water is mentioned but this time it's not called a river it's called an artesian well there is where the people make the mistake because it is called a whale and a river they think that in one place it is eternal life given by the spirit and in the next place where it is called a river implying a great dynamics it has to be the spirit now giving you an inn Dumont of power this is not so but you know we got one scripture we got to deal with when the Holy Ghost is come upon you receive power that's Scripture the Holy Spirit comes upon he's read for this new power he looked like they had arrived but they had something wrong it is one in the same it is a spirit that gives life and power and that came at Pentecost and he starts talking about experience going to roll it have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost now wants you you believe unto receiving the spirit that would be very very valuable later on because that's what you have to do it you have to believe under receiving but the people stop they go as far as the water and then stop they believe and then stop the Bible does not say that you receive when you believe it is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe the exact and literal translation is did you having previously believed receive the Holy Ghost the people believe and then stop you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto Him that sound like a fury saying you do know he's saying you don't duh you don't get the Holy Ghost when you believe you get the Holy Ghost when that believing is accepted of God okay the people bleed and then stop you don't receive the Holy Ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go own and receive the Holy Ghost you got to keep on going do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalist they have no power for they stopped short of Pentecost okay come on up he's talking about they're just like the children of Israel they stopped short of the promised land so come on up there was only two real true believers come out of the whole thing right then since that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers and he's just explaining what these others were do it by rejecting and thinking they're believing this what made the difference to stayed with the words when the heart of the ten spies failed at Katie's bar near Josh when Caleb did not stagger for they believe the word and said were more than able to take the land they knew they could because God had said had said I have given you the land after all those Israelites saw all the power and the goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into the rest which is the top of the Holy Ghost so you see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the Spirit of God I didn't say these things he's putting people up in different categories and we will too that you got justification you got sanctification you got the baptism you got a lot of things to deal with but there's no way all right how far did we get are we on what 148 we've got that one or am i okay okay we stop there so let's go wow okay let's go to the next go to Levin okay we still got it right we just got numbers we'll deal with now here is where the profit is saying what is the whole ego that's a message he pries upon this place we wish to approach the subject which i think is the outstanding subject of the day and the what is the holy spirit what is it and now the reason I've taken the subject in line like this now read this over and over and over and listen to him now's everybody awaiting took up enough to read it cause listen to it he said it's an outstanding subject alright what is the holy spirit what is it now the reason I've taken the subject in line like this you cannot come cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is well God understands he understands me and he did it he said you can't receive it unless you know what it is what is the Holy Spirit we just established the born-again experience the new birth and the baptism the Holy Spirit is one an assignment what is the baptism and why would he good you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it now listen if you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you now how many statements if I made that you got to believe it's for you what's it and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what the results it brain so if you know what it is and who it's to and what action it brings when it comes then you'll know what you've got when you get it is that it just settles it but I remember you so well you making it too complicated we just come to the altar and we get the kids to come you need to explain this to them you need to explain it what's good what's the thing you need to explain it they need to be born again and to be bored again they got to get the baptism of the Holy Spirit oh no but going again is just believing now you're off you're out of line because that's the whole thing of tonight's message we're man that can say the baptism of the Holy Ghost the born-again experience the new birth is there selfs nine-time then we're gonna read in just a minute another one to anchor more into that what are you listening but we don't need to know about the Holy Ghost well you don't know what you got and you don't know how to get it and you don't know what you got if you get it that's pretty good because you wouldn't know if you know what it is and who it's to how many times do I emphasize that you got to know it to you good listening last night to brother Billy paroled and he was emphasizing oh you know I give unto you I send them to you Elijah the Prophet you know that his wife believed that so much until when she got ready and brought a random asker about it about her well you know and when they were getting married or talking about it and she took the Bible and hand it to him and opened it he said behold I send you Elijah or the Prophet there's a lot of things honored you might order listen to you know you might find some things on there you don't like but you might find some things you do they've argued over Christmas tree Billy Paul stated it life not Leslie he said daddy put up a Christmas tree every year he even told the brothers that brought the Christmas tree down for them to put it out don't put one up I've never said nothing right you don't want to put one up don't put it up but don't say nothing about somebody that puts one up or vice-versa leave it alone but if you want the quotes you need to connect into the internet and listen to Billy Paul explain that they went the girls went in swimming and that brother branham said it wasn't safe to wear a dress because he tripped up come on see these things are coming out now the shows brother branham was a human heard that one the other day I knew it had always been there and it was brother Collins's daughter or Becky Beth they're big what all right she said that's the one that where she said at the motel the Brethren said I said in the door the motel with a pistol in my lap she was one to testify to that I knew that statement because somebody had made a call phone calls to the room in things he said that around cities set tire with a gun now she's one might statement on him I don't worry about it anyway alright go ahead now we're we're oh yeah go ahead we got to go to 154 role don't know we want this one all right back down yeah you come back get it make that yeah okay we get tickled over that cuz they say in an hour that actually up means down when they're trying to roll it and wow I get tickled at that that's why I am anyway I'm upside down 154 to learn in church age after he's explained all of these other things about it you're coming up to 154 which we'd come up to 148 reading in broke off and a lot of that next goes with evidence or the Holy Ghost etc different thing okay now listen brother branham what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost you say hey didn't say brother Randall no I said brother branham what is it I want to know what is the baptism with the holy God it's the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the Spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God what is the baptism of the holdest goes brother branham i like to throw these things out not caught how smart I am but what I know has already been in the mind of mankind because I faced it for 40 years see some would say what is the baptism that he said with the Holy Ghost that's different than being the Holy Ghost I've been their fault ease out and I'm not afraid to say God's Word is still true I'm still with that all right this is what do you think what is the baptism with the Holy Spirit it's the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new bar so the baptism in the Holy Spirit a new birth must be the and we read that while ago where the baptism the Holy Ghost in an uber the born-again experience is the same so we're still we've got that point so what is he going well we have just set forth would be much easier for all to understand if all believe the doctrine of the oneness for the Godhead where there are not three persons in that Godhead but one thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of Jesus Christ coming in then subsequent which means director - that the Holy Spirit coming in to give us power but brother branham the Bible says you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you see those things will have to come into order if that were true if it was true that you're born again by the Spirit of God you know life coming in Jesus Christ and then after that you receive some kind of Holy Spirit coming in to give us power now let me stop here and say this and then we'll be back to it the same Holy Ghost is justified - Luther sanctified - Methodist Baptist Pentecostal justification is work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is working the holds here but the baptism is the Holy Spirit I'm quoting brother Branham so if you wanted to say that you're born again by believing you know you want to say that and either say but what I need to do then I need to get the baptism - coma spirit no it's one spirit it's one God it may come in many different ways or what are the three stages of grace not works stages justice came st. case in the baptism of Holy Ghost completes the birth right constitute now use the word in the correct order constitutes anywhere because if you run that in about the completes and you work you're gonna have to find it over here to fit with that and together okay I try to save you time is that we're true if it was true that we get some kind of one birth here and then we got to get a baptism over here they'd never done that but yet this is the baptism of the holy spirit of faith this is a baptism of the holy spirit of the Apostle this is a baptism of the Holy Spirit it's three stages look are you listening to what I'm saying if you get justified that's the work of the Holy Spirit if you stay alright in that stage it's gonna move into sanctification I mean if you stay in that stage it's gonna move into the baptism of the holy God so what's the Holy Ghost all the way it's not what holy goes here one holy goes here the day he was justified it was the Holy Ghost that done the help today you were sanctified it was the Holy Ghost that done that the day you received the baptism it was the Holy Ghost that done that it's not all messed up if that were true look why would we dishonor the father go now listen one time about Jesus coming in be the son Holy Spirit coming in will be the Holy Ghost and then you left the father out of your religion goes now to listen what he say see we're dishonor than the father what are you gonna let him do not giving him a part in your in our complete salvation for our salvation is of the Lord and there are three Lords then he father must have something to do do but surely it can be seen that Jesus made this very clear that it was he and he alone who is God and that it is he and he alone who is coming into the livre John 14:16 said that the father will says that the father will come a father will send another comforter that looks like - today I'm working verse 17 says that he dwelleth with me and he'll be in me verse 18 says that he'll come to them who Jesus verse 23 and speaking to the disciples he said we father and son will come unto thee I love that one I love this statement thus it is the Father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at the one time for it is one person comprising the Godhead that Advent took place at Pentecost listen there aren't two comings he's the one wait a minute you just said here's the Holy Spirit and here's the Holy Spirit and here's the Holy Spirit right but there's only one coming that one coming this finished up into those three manifestations that Advent took place at Pentecost there aren't two comings of the Spirit just one the trouble is that people don't know the real truth and they simply believe in Jesus for a remission of sins but never going to receive the Spirit what about it they never go on to receive the Spirit this is if I can cut off and quit of what I can do let me get a couple of these and then we'll quit go to 13 this is a message called fellowship now the elements that came from the body of Jesus was water blood and spirit what came from his natural body is what constitutes the new birth water blood spirit just kidding same case baptism Holy Ghost anything you wanted to run through what come from his natural body is what constitutes the new work you know we talking about there's not his natural body that runs out and gives it to its typing it or signifying it or placing it said what's what is when a baby is born what's the first thing these went to it what constitutes the natural birth is the top of the spiritual birth what is the first thing water its water for separation justification by faith as the brother read the scripture this morning Romans 8 or Romans 5 justification by faith what's the next thing the cleansing sanctification taking the new mug and all and what's the knife it comes down to the baptism of the Holy Spirit okay let's get one more hidden life and that's the same thing it takes to make up the new birth now let me say this there's no point I hope by now we have found enough to understand and read enough from the Prophet to know what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is it is not shouting it is not speaking in tongues it is not crying those are after-effects it is as we read over all ago what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the new birth it is a spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard the word what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit it is the new birth what is the new birth it's the baptism of the Holy Spirit what is the born-again experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's the born-again experience okay so watch that's the same thing that it takes to make up to new burrow water blood and spirit justification my faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ cleansing up the sanctifying through the blood then the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you in the holiest of Holies now that constitutes the man who is separated from God and hid away in Christ let me get one more go to 16th 15 says what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God baptizing you anybody look what this one says from Christ from history of God reveal we want to know what the baptism of the Holy Spirit is then by doing that we can see what the new birth in we know what the new birth is we know what the baptism is we know what the born-again spirit it's all itself one that's what we just read well let me go okay next Sunday this coming Sunday you got to pull up it I'm not sarcastic you think I am you think I'm hateful and everything the move no it's just showing you how I believe it what I believe I'll give women men are the the right to stand here Sunday and try to tear down what your profit just we read because it ain't gonna do you no good but are you gonna believe it brother branham answer one question what is the new birth he just answered what is the baptism of the holy God he answer it is by saying it's the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it's the Spirit of God coming in and filling you that you have repented enough honey now listen now Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center to Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing I love that you know that now put a quote in here they brother branham's they say Godhead or what it he said is not complete without you there's a statement to that it's either God not complete without you or the Godhead is not complete without you because you're a part of God if you have the new birth okay makes a complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole time see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say well brother Branham what is the new birth here we're going across the top of the line up here we ain't running down in here in the tops and the shadows are you with me or what I've Illustrated that it the message does the Bible does will you say brother Branham what is the new birth it is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you he's talking about the new birth right now whether were is there any thing in there relating to any fleshly manner or anything so why do you make the new birth tongues are speaking in the new birth is the birth like I tried to explain the other day the baby normal baby now we exited some other if it don't cry it's wiggling muscles up but it's not alive then they gotta get too tough out of the mile and they either blow into the mouth which I'd like that part or either bread run said you strike him and he screamed out speaking in tongues another Newburgh the babies already died see you're making all of the things and I'm not against those things you will have one of those things related to your experience you will howl of joy please goodness meekness long-suffering at least one out of there that's what you think and I'm against experiences and done now I'd like to tell the truth and then have the experiences because look what is the new bar it's revelation Jesus Christ personally to you oh you mean a new birth is a revelation you mean a new the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a revelation I will pick it up Sunday I ask you to go read the book of Acts they said to come a mighty rushing wind that wouldn't a baptism said tongues the flyer said on each one of them God brother branham said questions and answer God was dividing himself among the people it was not the rushing wind it was the liquor fire it was the revelation it was God quickening what Peter had what John had what the others had you're gonna find out now from now on you're gonna find that brother Brian my brother Dale believes at one time the new birth the baptism in the Holy Ghost and the born-again experience is one in the same and it is a revelation so then now I'm not going to ask you to I ask you to tell me what your experience is I've asked that what is your experience tell me what happened to you my brother Tatum was I can tell probably Lona brother Tatum was sitting under a tree and raindrops it's like falling down out of the sky that's wonderful what do you call your experience what do you put your salvation home I believe the prophets met with the devil beat us to it give me the one thing that he can't argue with come on give me the one thing that the devil can't argue with the revealed word but one said he cannot bring the word word by word so now you're gonna wonder about it and you're gonna loop it out and everything yeah but how long has it being wage got a better memory how long has it been since we were back there talking about these things of what is your favorite Scripture is is rebel a Genesis 1:26 and 27 Holly what's your favorite Scripture st. Matthew what 632 okay anybody what's your favorite Scripture you know what mine is you know what line here behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet you know what that is because my wife is sitting right there when I first read the Bible in the Baptist Church I read over and I got over to Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 and I told her I said before the end of time comes according to the Bible there'll be two prophets coming I couldn't get it straight now I knew about the ones when he said I mean I knew about the Luke 1:17 we could read scripture we could put John the Baptist in and bring him in but we couldn't get that fourth guy you know what I mean so I said to brother mold he said well God sent us a prophet I said okay brother now put him in the word he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet he turned the hearts with you I said okay now I explained Malachi 3 he explained Malachi 3 of John the Baptist I knew he knew what he's talking about so what's your favorite scripture it might be that you want windup one of these days finding out that is your new birth when that scripture is made alive to you you definitely don't think that the entire Bible has got to be revealed to you just even say you got the new birth do you okay what is it what is the new birth in you'd say well brother around and what isn't he where it's revelation Jesus Christ personally you know listen not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by coda rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody else says what takes place it's Christ pastor priests or whatever it might be is Christ in you it's a revelation of the church is built upon you remember what the disciples were sitting up in the upper room and something happened right the Holy Ghost came and they went outside and what did they say somewhere right there in the fourth act I'm not come on this is that that was spoken of by the Prophet show me anywhere in the Bible or prophets message either way anybody ever received the Holy Ghost and it ain't word related our quickening of the word and you shorten tell me any word it's not something related to the word the quickening of the word so we order know what to do birth is it's a quickening of the word my hopes is built on the quickening of the word tongues interpretation shouting and glory hallelujah and great signs and wonders are all part of the Word of God and we don't want to do away with any of it but the new birth the born to get experience what did Jesus tell Nicodemus come on brothers what did Jesus tell Nicodemus his first doctrine was what you must be born again what did Jesus tell Nicodemus is the Nicodemus you got to be born from above that's original translation you got to be born from above in other words you got to be born from where I come from where'd he come from he came from the word but I said there the other day talking about when old sister birds were sitting there and I was preaching on I come from God and I go to God and I preached for an hour and a half all about the one God and all those things was headed on the way home she said brother Dale I've seen what you're talking about I said well great I'm glad you did she said yes said he come from God he went to God said he was God all the time I just said to our dumbfounded and this is what I said I said sister I wish I'd let you preach tonight because she got over in two minutes what I tried to get over an hour and a half with words she said he was God all the time well we got brother let's say mistake [Music] ah Jesus keep me from all these satisfied as I walk let me walk close to thee closer walk with me what about it [Music] jesus is my plea he leave letter on him what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ that baptizes you into the body it is the new birth it is the born-again experience [Music] they know to comments oh I got you now the probably said one day they comes at your baptism What did he say there are concepts of baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] it came on to their Pentecost it will come again in the faith of the Father it will come in the headstone but it's three stages but one god it's the same God coming to fill us and then dwelleth how simple how simple I'll read it to you Sunday you know the story but let's just hold it let me do this hold it brother boy let's read something you know the stole reading I won't give you both of them I'll give you one you know the stories I was expressing the other day where that brother Branham was talking about the man that picked up the track no it's alright pick up the track and said where will you spend eternity he said right there he started searching for God he went to the or I went to Billy Graham he went to the Pentecost he went to the GNAT he went to every one of them he said never got it they finally told him said you need to go to William Branham and said he's a prophet said he can be able to go through it you know what brother Branham said he said you don't need for me to pray for you he said you need to believe the word he said you remember when you picked up the track did you he said you turned around right doc he said you turned around and started in another direction he said sir you didn't have to sell your cars to give the minister's you didn't have to do that I said you already received Christ he said brother branham this is message thirsting for life he said brother Branham did I receive him when I spoke with tongues cuz he said he done all these times are shouted or when I raised up my hands I said neither one you received him when he knocked at your door what changed you what made the difference you were going down a road one way not caring for God I said shouting all right raising up your hands is all right speaking in tongues is all right they're all all right but it's not all the truth to receive Christ is to receive the person of Christ to receive Christ in the shout in the speaking in the tongues and all takes place he said you mean I had it all the time what about it there's about five or six messages that bread around and explains that man you were to read all of them because he goes in two confessions enzymes and what is it what happened to the man the man got a revelation from God because he says I've got to do something about this I've been 40 years and I've got to do something about it but around said he turned around started the other way he said dar was your conversion all these other things are fine he said but he said your conversion is when you accepted him right dark well you seem to be making him brother Taylor this is a revelation I didn't brother Brennan did you seem to be saying that it was something that the man should have known all the time that he had it he should have cause he had it your prophet said he did now you argue with him well he had to go through this he had to go through that head he made a pretty good point of going through a lot of things if you want to top this with that in the other cuz he started out believing he started into fountain he started into speaking in tongues he started in to going to the prophets he started into the basis of giving away a half a million dollars to the preachers to try to find an answer that's what he says read around and said you just needed to believe the word what about it do we believe the word yes but brother tail you're doing away with my experience so that's all I've ever had he's I've had this feeling that I said it would things were that ain't doing away with nothing I'm trying to tell you that could be but it's not your experience brother Brennan said one of the mysteries was receiving of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a sensation now how many more tapes and books do you want me to pull off with my desk looking at the papers where brother Brennan said you've got to have a sensation he said if you get the new birth you go to have a sensation now what's he saying without a sensation without some kind of a something like that but let it be what God wants you to do let him be to you what God wants him to be father we thank you for tonight and we just pray that you'd bless and go home with the people right on the road with them and express what's being said we love you
