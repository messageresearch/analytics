========================================

all right next Sunday you can um we're gonna start on faith on the Statue of a perfect man we're going to kind of finish up today with what God Said here in Proverbs chapter 8. start with faith the foundation what thank you let's start with hello what verse 7. chapter 8 verse 7. and I want you to look at how many times that that God says I my because I've got them all circled in my Bible and it's just all the way down through there so you see that it's what God is doing but watch how the me and the me and the eye and eye becomes God and you together as one all right but watch for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an Abomination to my lips all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing forward or perverse in them they are all plain to him that understandeth okay there's no mystery to this thing the mystery is history if somebody comes to bring you a mystery you better get away from them because the mystery's already finished brother Rams are the mystery is now history so we're looking at the open book they are all plain to him that understandeth and write to them that findeth not or they find knowledge receive my instructions and not Silent not silver and knowledge rather than Choice gold for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it what wisdom I wisdom so it must be a person eye wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions in other words just what we were talking about the devil's devices all right the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogance in the evil way in the forward mouth do I hate counsel is mine and sound wisdom I am understanding see there's I I have understanding I have strength so if you're born again today that's what we're going to talk about next Sunday being born again because that starts at Faith when the eye I am see what it says I am understanding so who is that that's Jehovah God but when he comes down we know that that Jehovah's the old is Jesus of the new so that's what he is but if you're a part of that then you become wisdom you become knowledge and you have strength so I am understanding I have strength by me who wisdom or God or you can say by me if you're born again you see how close this is going to be by me King's Reign and Princess decree Justice by me Prince's Rule and Noble even all the judges of the Earth I love them that love me and those that I seek that those that seek me early shall find me praise the Lord Eula yeah praise the Lord said praise the Lord that's because your parents are dead well yeah praying for death free praise the Lord that's right that's good ain't that right you see that you'll see yeah I can get a lot more toys now because my parents don't have to pay for Dad I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me rich is an honor are with me yay durable riches and righteousness my fruit is better than gold yay then fine gold and my revenue is in Choice silver I lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the passive judgment then I may cause those that love me to inherit substance what does the Bible say faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so what's he talking about faith that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance all right and I will fill their treasure promise I will fill their treasure all right so we get to New Birth and we're going to start at Faith next Sunday we're going to fill ourselves up there or God's Gonna Fill us up through the statue and perfect man starting next Sunday then verse 21 that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance that I will and I will fill their Treasures the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way not our way predestination before the foundation of the world now look what's happening here in Proverbs he's going all the way before the foundation of the world and that's what I wrote my book that's promised to me the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way now we know he's talking about wisdom but if we're connected with the wisdom we got new birth we got new birth right I am is in us then this is talking about you and I all right I was set up wait a minute the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old in other words before the six days of creation he knew who we were before the foundation of the world right I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning or ever the Earth was when there were no depth I was brought forth when there was no fountain abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was before the hills was I brought forth well as yet he had not made the Earth nor the field nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there amen amen when he said accomplice upon the face of the death when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the world there I was by him and that's not by him standing by him we are by him by him all things are made so he comes forth by him come forth that by has come forth not standing beside that's good remember we don't want God standing beside woman God in us all right we don't want to we don't want an anointing or a perusian or something like that we won't God ends God's got to be in you to wrap you out of here he can be an anointed one God can stand right by the side of an anointing one him dying go to hell because he's not in right okay he's got to be in you then I was by him as one brought up with him that's why I see when you get the new birth that's why it's so important the Statue of first man is so important because that's the mind of God if you're not born again you can't understand the mind of God you can't understand just the simple things right that's just a common I mean that's just a common knowledge but once you do you come under the you come under all these promises that when I was then I was by him as one brought up with him and I wish daily his Delight this was the creator we're talking about here all right rejoicing always before him Where Were You Joe when uh sons of God's got it for Joel or you Joe when God laid the foundation of the world okay and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable habitable part of his Earth not this Earth his Earth all right where were we what's God's word Jesus Christ God's Earth is Jesus Christ right right right the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand what was the kingdom the kingdom was in him so where were we we were in him we were in his Earth okay we got to remember that this thing got disconnected but we got to find out that it what was disconnected has got to be reconnected like brother Bob did some wonderful job last night man I remember just perfect for what we needed at the time and God wants us back to fellowship like Adam and Eve Adam and Eve in the cool of the garden walking in front of God communing with God with no shame and that's what we're going to do over there with no shame we're going to commune with god well we got to get back to that here we can't wait till we get into heaven everybody's wanting to wait to get to heaven to do things why can't we do that here right because if we're restored back here was The Fellowship here's where we fell well when we go back to here it's like Bob said last night that's where we connect back with God and we get to bring our spouse with us who is us and not just live through this life with a spouse we live through eternity with a spouse the same one brother Brown hadn't meeting brother Brown had hope and they'll live together not as we live down here but like we were like I was saying last night not to have to what brother Bob was saying but it it does it helps us to see that if we love our wife our husband down here and we think man we're Inseparable we are one which is true but brother Brown said take that filial of right times a million times a million times a million and he said that's what agape love is over there so you think well man we're not going to be able to be husband and wife like we are and that would be better right we'll be more all the jealousy will be gone all the tones of life will be gone all them you know having to get up and go to work and and balance the checkbook and balance our finances and all those things you know you're going to be right there and you're gonna be able to live Eternal with she's not going to get old and you're not going to get old so praise the Lord for that so but like Boyd was saying last night we're so much one to where when you see brother Dale you don't have to see Mama but you do see Mom right because brother and sister that was so much one you see if you see one of them you know that they're totally connected and I wish that worked for everybody but uh we're getting there rejoicing in the habitable part of his Earth and my Delights were with the sons of men all right now therefore hearken unto me owe you children for blessed are they that keep my ways hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not there's the key he's laid out here but we still have to choose whether we want to keep it or refute it all right blessed is a man that heareth me watching daily at my Gates waiting at the post of my door listen to this for who shall findeth me find his life and shall obtain favor of the Lord but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love death all that to hate me love death all right so there we come to a place to where we gonna we're gonna to uh see if anybody has any questions but we're going to start next Sunday with faith the foundation and statue of perfect man to read the book I'm going to read a quote here from statue of perfect man 1962 1014. just kind of scan through but you don't have to go all the way through it just go we're running around covers faith and then stop because we're going to cover virtue after that but we're going to cover Faith face real wide real big long foundation so we need to cover Faith a lot longer then we need to cover the other ones all right okay because you got to have a good foundation all right like brother Tom was talking about Wednesday night did such a wonderful job you gotta have that Foundation built on a rock you can't have it built on sand first this is paragraph 131 first you must be born again right and then when you're born again you have faith because really it's just a hope all right faith is Faith is the substance of things we'll get into it next Sunday but listen to what he's saying watch first you must be born again and then when you're born again you have faith he's talking about substance Faith right he's not just talking about believing your car is going to start tomorrow believing that this is going to happen or believe no he's talking about substant faith he's talking about the faith of God when we come to a place to where we say God this is it I'm done with everything else this is it this is the faith I have it says when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it you so I don't argue against the word if you don't do it out there you're arguing against it nobody understand you know I'm not going to argue against the word I don't ever I don't get up arguing no but if you don't live what the word says you're arguing against the word of God just the way it is sorry if you're just religiously inclined and you've got a a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God you'll never do it now this is the prophet he's talking yesterday somebody was um talking about something about denominational churches the girls wear shorts men wear shorts they take their coffee in they take their water in they take and they just and they just have a it's just a lodge meeting well somebody said well why is that I said guys you don't believe what the prophet said now if a prophet We Believe brother Brown's a prophet if a prophet declared something in the Bible if Elijah declared it wasn't going to rain for three and a half years it didn't rain because the prophet said it right brother Brown said they're lodges there'll never be nothing but a lodge so listen folks it's like me oh Clark and I were talking about last night he said the Bible says don't touch that unclean thing don't ever go out there thinking you're going to save them people as a church whole no way they're dead they're done and buried sorry but that's what the prophet said so there gonna never be no more than a lodge now people are going to come out of that people are gonna come out of that looking for something right but the ones that stay in there that's just the lodge that's just where they go and have a cup of coffee kind of like we did last night we had a Valentine's dinner you know we ate and we you know we drank some sweet tea and and we just had a meeting we talked about God a little while then we had fun we play party games you know I mean well that's exactly one a denomination is it's just a watch if brother Brown said it was just a lodge then it's just a lodge it never will be nothing else but Lodge so let's just try to I I love people in the out in those churches but as long as they stay in that system I'm not gonna have nothing to do with them don't ever go out there and say you're going to go out there and convert to people you don't convert to people you bring them here this is where the word is it ain't out there it's here that's dead John admired that in Revelations John turn and admired it and the word admired means love and the angel immediately showed him that there was a cup full of blood overflowing and that's where all that came from was that treaty church that he showed John in Revelation remember John typed us John Topps us right right so the bride was leaning and looking at that denominational horror sorry and was admiring it and immediately the angel said no said all the blood of the Martyr Saints is in the cup she's holding in her hand so that made John turn away from him same thing with us we could get away from this stuff well we can think well they're okay no they're not okay they're dead unless you're alive in Christ and you got the new birth you're dead I don't care if you're sitting here today that's what really attracts the foolish virgin to me because when they're asked you know what they believe they'll say it's better to serve God within the framework of the church and that's going to happen here that's going to happen in I don't say this church but that's going to happen in the in the ranks of the message and it's happening already that they're compromising with the word of God saying the Cloud's not right and this is not right and brother random's not right they'll become compromisers don't ever be a compromise because look but my point is watch what brother Brown said until you're born again you're arguing against it okay so if you're not born again you're always going to argue somebody's gonna that's why that bastard children can't take correction you try to correct somebody and they go oh I bless God well says right here until you're born again you'll argue against it if you're just religiously inclined and you've got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God you'll never do it so there's the line there's the prophet there's a line you'll always be a compromiser you'll always live a different life out there and then come in here and live a different one here so don't don't don't mess with me on that one because brother Brown was very he was very straight on the line they're dead right we're alive don't mix them death and life don't mix together all right you've got to be born again and born again it produces faith all right then after you've got faith this right here f-a-i-t-h he's pointing at the chart then you're just in position of growth you just in position of growing that's when you really start he said when I'm born again a gorgeous dealing with me and all these things he's dealing with you as a baby you're drinking milk you're stumbling and falling sometimes because you're a little baby you're you're a spirit baby in Christ but he wants us to go and grow up to where Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None Peter didn't have anything uh physically because he says silver and gold in other words what he was saying to the person the guy at the gate beautiful he was impotent in his or in his legs and he said look man I can't take you to a hospital I don't have enough money to take you to a clinic to get you better we were staying up you know Benny and them last night till about one o'clock talking about this but it's loud as hell we get sick we're going to the doctor that's okay but what about when we can't get to the doctor right that's what Peter was saying Peter said silver and gold in other words I can't make you a doctor's appointment for us to go figure how this thing works he said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have right he had some substance and it came out that was The Virtue because remember they walked in that right up there where brotherly kind of says that Peter Paul and all them they were at the faith of the fathers that's what's been eat down through the denominational years now it's being brought back up because we got to take that to take a Rapture but they had it he said Silver and Gold Have I learned but such as I have I give underlying yeah I've been standing on faith and you can probably talk for the next year or just on faith oh yeah I'm sure Jesus even rebukes the disciples but not having enough Faith that's right so how much more oh absolutely well see he reviewed the disciples and he knew they weren't born again he just knew he had given something to use and they were using it because they didn't have substance Faith until the day of Pentecost the day of Pentecost they had substance faith the one before Jesus was imparting Faith he was giving him he said go out he'll sit cast out Devils do things like that but what greater though he said when the uh we'll read it when the shepherd's still here you can lean toward me but what are you gonna do when I'm gone when I'm gone though I'm gonna make a promise I'm going to come back and be greater right like we were talking about last night about the third pool brother Brown said what you see in part when a man if what his was part if that from from 47 to 65 if that was part he said what you've seen in part you'll see in this fullness when the squeeze comes and why because it was in one man then right now it's in a mini-membered body listen the worst thing they can do like Tom was talking about Alaska the worst thing they can do is put us together exactly that's the worst thing they can do is put us together Upper Room everybody understand 12 and the Feet Work Church in emphasis had 12 people and brother Brown said it was a powerful Church so the worst thing they can do is put us together get them together so hey if I take us to Alaska some of y'all that get cold that's your problem sorry sister Anna you just have to get you a mutt luck or something or some fur and all that stuff you know that's okay but you know what though but watch the third pull then he said when the squeeze comes watch it then he's in other words so that's what I'm saying if we do have to go to Alaska and if they do tow us out to the elements if you break your leg we're supposed to be to the point and say Silver and Gold Have I None I can't take you to a doctor because they won't we we've been marked right see they're gonna Mark us thinking that we're the ones with the mark of the base it's kind of like Ahab going to Elijah and he says Elijah you are causing us so much trouble that's what the government's going to say to us you called and Elijah's going to go I'm no I'm not the trouble you're the trouble right okay and then go ahead Elijah and remember he took Elisha and put him right in the middle of the enemy's camp and opened the enemy's eyes and they overtook them that's what's going to happen to you and I we're going to be to a place where we say silver and gonna have our none but um brother Bob breaks the leg or he's got something serious went on lay hands on the sick say I'll recover that bone will come right back where you go sleep that's the third pull in his power but we don't need it now how many of y'all rolled in a in a cold car come to church this morning had to take a cold shower last week because you couldn't get no water how many of you when you have a toothache you go put a little Orajel on her to go to the doctor that's what I thought you think this is going to work this ain't gonna work like brother Dale said persecution why we should have it you know why because we're all out of sand we don't have to go scrounge for our food no we go to Ingles Kroger hey we got a choice so what is this so it's like a brother Tom and I were talking this is where we get the word packed in US and Brenda asked last night she said well what are we going to do if we can't come to church if we're scattered I said brother Dale's always said he's trying to pack you for so much of the word that's right but where if you can't get with somebody or you can only get with two or three he said we're two or three who gathered in my name you can get two or three people together God's just as pleased there as he is in this church once they close this church down so don't worry don't have fear this is the greatest time coming there's going to be a people that's going to make it through and he give it to us not the other ages he's give us the equipment to make it through right you know Alaska's Alaska is a scary place they told us when we were up there they prepare for winter three months in advance and one guy said if you don't prepare for winter you're probably gonna die because the Wilderness up there it's bad it's harsh 40 below zero you could die of you can die on hypothermia 40 degrees if you get wet imagine minus 40. when nothing will work you can't fire a gun at minus 40 degrees because you bolt stuck so what are you gonna do we're gonna have trust in God there was light and Goshen where everything else was black that whole land just like the United States had a total blackout and there's one little place in Louisville Georgia a little Dot and we got light and everything you know let's go outside and go Amanda we got sunshine and then you know two miles down the road you can't see in front of you your hand in front of your face well that's what God's going to do if he delivered the people of Israel and if he delivered everybody down Through the Ages just like that he's got to do the same thing for us I was just going to say my son told me it's been a couple years ago that those in camps in Alaska um they're fully staffed what they even have staff waiting well guys if brother Branham said that in 1963 that they had camps already in Alaska they probably already blow bulldozed them over because that's been 40 something years 50 years them things are old by now the ones brother Brown was talking about they built some new ones now I'm sure so some people are going to be herded up like the Jews if we're a type of the Jews and the Jew was persecuted just like that they were taking the Concentration Camp some didn't make it some did but what about a place because the Jews didn't have the Holy Ghost right so they were put into these places and they folded their they folded their clothes and they thought they were going to live in this big dormitory and all of a sudden the door shut the window shut and the gas comes on and they killed him but what a but what a meeting to be there and have 500 people in a building 500 Believers in the building because you're going to know when a believer in unbelief that's why brother Branson analyzen Sapphire may not be always in a church it could be out in a meeting somewhere it could be out when we go you're gonna you're gonna find out if you got the goods or not but what about when they turn the gas on and open it up an hour later and we're still in there rejoicing and praising God because the gas ain't gonna bother us if we're predestinated to make the Rapture that's right without a body I mean with a body change and not death I don't care who they put I don't care what they turn on cyanide they didn't do anything you want to anything they want to they cannot harm you unless God's ready for you to go it's like sister Brenda out in Oklahoma I met her two weeks ago she was like another long time she was so smiling and just so she was so happy she's dead the doctors don't know broclosure the doctor said they do not know what killed her he said they would try this and she'd get worse try this she'd get worse and what they tried to reverse it and make it better than anybody else it made her worse so they just quit and she just died God saw her come to a point and that's all she could do she was finished with her race she was done so now she's asleep She's Not Dead she's sleeping okay she's she's not dead you saw the Bible says the dead in Christ Your Eyes First You're Dead In Christ now all right I've always and I told you another day that just that would just come to me brother Bob and you just sometimes you'll be thinking on something like that and I'm like God well now that scripture just sounds a little bit around alive and remain will not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the dead and Crash Your Eyes First well there's no death to a Christian their sleep but if you're dead in Christ you're dead now so what he's saying is the dead that are in Christ now that go to sleep will come up and we which are alive and remain that are dead in Christ now we're not going to hinder those in our sleep because that's all they're doing is sleeping praise God sister Brenda was she had a lot of depression and stuff from coming out in Oklahoma she had a lot of depression issues she had migraine headaches so bad she just get sick and just pass out she'll never have to worry about that no more right Eternal as Eternal can be she's right there at that point so so they had a nice home going for her yesterday and her dad was not very sad uh Clark said maybe you'll hit him later but just keep keep a family in prayers it was really sudden she was only like 40. 45 something like that and she battled depression for a long time but uh God took her home she started coming back to church about five or six years ago really really started living the life and give her heart to God and she's not a lot better place than we are if you ain't gotta go through nothing no more she's dying she's Spanish she's asleep she's waiting on us she's one of those they now they without us cannot be made perfect all right let's go Faith that's what we're gonna start on next thank you
