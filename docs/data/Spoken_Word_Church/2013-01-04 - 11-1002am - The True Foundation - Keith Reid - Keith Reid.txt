and um you know it's was reading there in Dr Luke's gospel you know he speaks of uh this Foundation and this morning I'd like to speak on the true foundation right the the true foundation and the Bible says here in St Luke 6 and verse 47 whosoever cometh to me and hear my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom is liken is liken unto man which buil a house and dig deep and lay the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose and the the the stream beat vly upon that house and the cloud not shake it it could not shake it for it was founded upon a Rock Amen and he that heareth and dwth not is like a man that with without a foundation build a house upon the Earth against which the streams did beat vly amen and immediately it fell right and the rain the ruin of that house was great may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated in the message of the oncoming storm brother Brenham St like this he said Jesus was speaking here of a coming stor storm which has got to strike every man and every woman that's born in the world Amen right there is just no way out of it that storm will strike you sometime or another yeah and depends on what kind of a foundation you have amen whether your house will weather it or not right there many lives saved because of preparation for storms right amen hallelujah and there has been many of lives lost because of failing to take heed to the warning of storms that's coming Hallelujah you know I I can remember the the first hurricane that had passed away uh it was the the very year that we were mared married and um you know the the young people in Jamaica had never seen an hurricane because the the last hurricane that had passed that time was 1951 and so 1988 there there was a projection that an hurricane was coming and you know the whole folks would have said you know we prayed that it didn't come but we young people we said man I want to see it I want to have an experience of this uncoming storm and I remember I was talking to an old guy and you know I said what what it was in 1951 when this this hurricane strike he said he said the only thing that I can tell you after the storm had passed as far as your eyes can see because all the trees were gone houses were gone but you know what we never seen it so he said I want to see the star I want to be a part of that storm oh yeah but you know I remember that night when the storm strike oh yes oh yeah and we had there waiting that this is it there is something about the storm it it goes in one direction and then after you know it's moving in a circle and it goes in One Direction so it pass you moving one way and and then there's a cal yeah yeah and they they call it the eye of the storm and you know when the high came that there's a lot of people were happy oh the storm had passed but they didn't realize that was just the high of the storm that had passed and while they went out looking and amen and and saying Oh I thought it would be more they didn't realize that something great was underway oh it wasn't when it passed the first first time that was a destruction it was a second time it strike and you know the next morning they were crying they said never again never again we would want to be a part of the storm yeah right brother brandham said there's an oncoming storm that's going to strike every man right every woman that is born in this world that's right and it seemed like some sometimes s when we are without experience we said give us the storm let us see the storm yeah but he said hallelujah amen as the Bible declare it is the foundation that the house is laid upon amen that's right I tell you this Brethren when we came first to the word of God we all came out of something right we all came from an experience we said we've got a frame of reference amen you you know I hear people testify am mean you know oh when I was filled with the Holy Ghost in Pentecost amen when I came out of this uh when I've been through this experience uh but we know that the true birth of this age uh has going to come by the message of the hour that's right amen that's right amen yes sir there is a true foundation right but yet there are many foundation and Brethren I tell you what we've got to amen the Bible said you've got to dig deep yeah until you strike Solid Rock because if you don't then when the storms come it's going to move your foundation out of the way you know heard years ago they said people who believe the message we've got an experience we know that whatsoever we do we must strike some Solid Rock we must make sure that we are built upon amen True Foundation amen not just to come by and said oh this is what I have right yeah I've seen an experience in my time I remember when I first came and started to preach the message in linston my yeah you know my hometown and you know people begin to take all of the message and and the books were going out and me people were getting I noticed that different ones are different experience from what they glean from the same message and I found one time there was a brother and friend of mine every every time he he takes a little message book uh you know he don't read the introduction he don't read the St he goes to the back of the book just right where the message ends and the pearline is going to start and that's the part he start to read from yeah because uh he his mind was captivated amen by this message of healing yeah right right and there are those who amen never take the preliminary but they they started from right where the scripture was read yeah because they want to read this portion yeah but then I I I I see a little more as I I go along you you take a book that somebody has read and and they've made their Mark in it yeah and you look at the thing things that amen they highlight and you know if you are like me you know when when I read something and something strike me I put a little Mark there right exactly amen sometimes we I light it and you know but and I find that you know you might read the same book but if I take what what I I like and might be what brother Wade I like we might ilight different things really amen amen and that is what stri thank you you know Brethren but listen it doesn't matter amen where the attraction comes from when we started out we all got to start from the same point are you there with me that we do not come to the message because we hear a voice of healing right it's not because we were told that there is a prophet in the land but Brethren we've all got a start the same point for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body which is the body of Jesus Christ Brethren may I say to you you got to come in by birth hello somebody amen it doesn't matter what the attraction is we come into it by birth and so I might be attracted attracted to this for years and because of that uh I'm Associated around the message but there's got to be a day in your life where something struck you that's right you know I tell you I was a part of this message for years for a few years before it really struck me amen my my my initial uh attraction was and I I I I was a Baptist to to begin with I was never baptized but that is my Foundation I I went to the Baptist Church when I was a child and the first thing that struck me was might be amen the the the the Heralds of healing in our time yeah and so I begin to amen read more ofen this great phenomena that amen we don't talk about in a Baptist church yet we would have many times that we believe God Is A Healer but here now I was reading of of of events that happen right and it it struck me that there's got to be something about this and Bren I tell you the truth even when I was baptized into it uh it's not because uh amen that I realized that there was a message to take a bride out of a Rapture but I realized that baptism in Jesus name was right are you there with me and I was coming upon that premise but Brethren I never yet it the foundation and and I tell you what amen until amen I had that birth from the word amen hello somebody am then I realize amen this is not just something to let a people look different uh this is not just something to let you walk different uh but there is a message to take us behind the veil amen that's right amen Hallelujah because there's a coming storm hello somebody you know the the Peter said am me for all things continue as they were until the time of restitution and I believe that we are getting into the time of restitution of all things which he said Hallelujah the mouth of all the holy prophets speak of since the world begin and Brethren if there's a Time to be sure that time is now Glory right Hallelujah if we're ever going to be sure of where we're standing we've got to be certain now GL in the message of the oncoming storm he said Jesus was speaking here of a coming storm okay let me go to God keep his word yeah amen he said that's what we need today is preachers right and Men Who will say What God Says to be the truth exactly hello right we're talking about a true foundation right what we need is preachers and men who will say What God Says to be the truth amen amen no matter if it's a great organization that you're building upon right if it's not built upon the word of God right amen it will fall no matter what else you have it will fall if it's not on the word of God Amen you know Brethren I use a statement back home to the people I said you know we might say well I'm going to do this tomorrow and tomorrow I never get to do it right amen or I might have a good intention of of something that I I really want to do and from my heart I'm honestly I want to do it right but I never get around to it really but I said I want you to take God's word like this when God says something brother Bram said that God becomes guilty of his word until he brings it to pass that's right God don't just speak the way we speak but when God utter a word he pledge his word are you there with me so when God said in his word I send my word to you it's not a saying it's a pledge even and H can pass away but that word cannot pass and all God need is somebody to believe that hello that's right you know I remember years ago I was told that there was a sister amen and she was an old woman and you know she started to read the message when she was old and she was reading a message and she she found something something there something that said if you're born out of wedlock she she was interpreting you can't make it in yeah and she take that book and she was crippled in her bed and and she stuck it under her pillow and she laid there dying because she had something that she was holding on to right that I can't make it hello somebody right and she held on to that and her condition was getting worse and somebody said what's the problem she held that sacred in her heart yeah that I can't make it yeah oh Brethren right but then somebody said what's a problem oh she said but here this is what I found in there and I realized that there's no place for me yeah but then she was taken a little further right amen Hallelujah glory and when God speak he's not just saying it but he pled his word hallelujah what Joy she had to realize amen that God consider me glory amen hallelujah amen yes sir we're got to take God at his word take God at his word when we're building up the found ation we got to say what God said we got to do what God Said are you there with me oh Brethren your foundation is not what you came to the message with right it is not amen that light that F of light that attracted you to the message and you came believing that that God said a prophet and oh I love the message amen I love amen the the the way the prophet did and the thing he said about hunting and so you know I I tell you this I mean in our country we don't read those parts because we don't understand most of the things they're saying yeah amen that's right those are L the things that bind us together it's a word that come from God that's right amen hallelujah amen oh Foundation the foundation has got to be right right are you with me amen the foundation has got to dig deep down until it hit Solid Rock right amen hallelujah the voice of the sign God will be his church upon the foundation of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and that's the Bible outside of that all of the ground is sinking sand amen hallelujah that's God's Foundation that Foundation is Christ and therefore you're not you have not laid the foundation until you get into Christ the word are you there with me amen amen so my Foundation is not laid in in Lula my Foundation no my Foundation is in Jesus Christ my Foundation is not in Jamaica my Foundation is hallelujah not in the church when I first heard it my Foundation is in Jesus Christ are you there with me Hallelujah therefore now God pledge amen through the mouth of Isaiah the prophet in Isaiah 28 and verse 16 he said therefore thus say the Lord God behold I lay in s for a foundation a stone Hallelujah a tried Stone precious Cornerstone a sure foundation and that is God's pledge to you and I I give you a true a sure Foundation Hallelujah you don't know he said he laid in Zion no notice Zion though refering prophecy to Jerusalem Zion means lifted up Hallelujah that Foundation that God give to us that's where we're going to dwell Hallelujah no wonder we promis a city that has been lifted up out of the earth and the God will come down and dwell on that City he said he that believe shall not make haste a true foundation Hallelujah Glory the foundation that is buried in the word of God in this Foundation amen God tell us who he's going to bring us bring us to it you know I love the way the word of God is structured is that God don't leave you on a limb there somewhere yeah he tell you exactly how he's going to do it and he brings you from the very periphery right your foundation has got to be in faith right but you know sometimes we misunderstand what faith really is to the believer yeah hello amen but you know we know that faith is your BN again experience are you there with me and that Born Again experience amen the Myster of God reveal he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's right amen right now Brethren if that is the revelation of Jesus Christ the very Foundation of your faith is to know who Jesus is that's right amen right that is not a Doctrine right amen glory hello amen that is not something that our church believe that's the foundation of your faith that if you don't know who he is you're not in the economy of God hello somebody Baptist said oh he a second person of the Trinity oh afraid we're getting back to that yeah but Brethren is the only person are you there with me Hallelujah more than that Hallelujah the word of God is taking you under behind the veil amen hallelujah that in Hebrew Paul said and such an high priest become us right Hallelujah that what the bride need today Hallelujah this is see God be kin again how will he do it brother BR said in your flesh he going to walk upon the Earth if you don't have that true foundation you cannot represent him oh we're trying to fight to find out when was he really God yeah yeah right was he God then when did he become God and when he when was he not God again oh brother bam said I've never changed my message one I right he preached one true and living God are you there with me and that's the foundation of your faith

way it used to sound to me it seems like I'm feeding from something that is beyond me that's right Hallelujah amen I continue with a quote and now Abram was a foundation of Faith you know sometimes we think that that Foundation of faith is nothing but that Foundation of Faith cut Abraham from everything that he had before right it was like circumcision right that caught him from his father's house right call him from his AC acquaintance and bring him out into a land where where God said that you're going to be a stranger that's right yep Hallelujah y hallelujah amen hallelujah GL you're going to be a stranger in this land right and Brethren I tell you what when you receive him you're going to be a stranger that's right to those around you you know you're going to look back and says why is it that they can't but that's the way you were right that's right hello somebody what a change it has been Hallelujah since I have this new birth oh Abraham if we look at the life of Abraham he walked out the Bible says he stagged under the promise of God through unbelief but he was faithful in the promise right you know we can look at instances in Abram's life where we said oh Abram left the land y he lied hey hello somebody mean ABR did all these things but that day God said to Abraham Abraham walk before me and be the perfect hello somebody I'll tell you what it wasn't just Abraham it was God are you with man it's not just you it is God hallelujah somebody amen oh Brethren I tell it's going to take Grace it's going to take Grace to let you make it amen oh hallelujah amen the foundation of love was Isaac right yeah amen right God's Building a body right Hallelujah you you you know we said oh I love those who who who love us yeah but you know Brethren to reach to the point where you love them no matter what yeah right are you there with me right exactly that your desire is that all men might see the word of God right that your desire is that all men might know God right right hallelujah amen amen Isaac has got to have a day yeah the foundation of Grace was Jacob because Jacob could said I did not deserve it but God gave it to me that is your message of Grace amen hallelujah Bren I tell you when on that day of your Redemption it's going to be Grace God's grace because certainly brother how it's not who you are it's who God Is Right amen hallelujah that's right amen and Jacob brother BR said and there was nothing about him they sold him out but he loved them anyhow right Hallelujah glory and in Jacob was Perfection I just read a little he said now the foundation is laid through faith love Grace and to Perfection through the Patriots now the body work right that comes on this great master Masterpiece was the prophets amen right because let me tell you this may iwake you this morning to tell you you can't live in the foundation all the days of your life there'll never be a building oh yes the foundation is right that's right then You' got to build on it exactly hello amen amen you know I don't know how they do it back here but you know in in in our country when when you borrow money especially from the bank and your your B put in a building you know the the first the most important part of it youve got to do the foundation according to the plan and when you do the foundation before they Grant you any more money they've got to check and approve that Foundation because they don't want to invest in something that don't have solid foundation if they can do that what about the word of God what about God's investment Hallelujah right so he said now but now the body work the foundation has got to be sure but the body work that comes on this Great Masterpiece was a prophet which was the word amen I hope you can read it that's right the prophets not the law right right exactly not the law right oh you if you do this I will do that if you do no no sir no sir because the word to you and I comes by unconditional Covenant it's not you now it's God that's right yes amen hell it's not you it's God oh I would have made an awful mistake if that was me right are you there with me amen maybe You' be running over the country this morning following the many voices that there is hallelujah echoing what they call the message but God hallelujah amen I never plan to be here but God because of his word are you there with me that's why you got to be certain of God right hello because if you're not certain you're going to miss him right Hallelujah yes amen the prophets not the law the prophets for the prophet was the Vindicated word which makes the body right yes not the Patriots that's right the prophet they they were the word amen exactly Hallelujah right don't you love that this morning the prophet is the word right Amen in the message that identified Masterpiece of God 1964 he said then we came then it came to the Patriarchs we come next in the Old Testament as we go down here the display of the foundation of his work right now we have Abram Isaac Jacob and Joseph the four patriarch now Abram represent fate work Faith cuz Abram was Faith right yeah and he had a great faith he stag of the promise of God to unbelief hallelujah amen the Chip he a that when we say the chip is down and everything against him is still held on to God Amen hello right hello when they disputed what he believed is still held on right because it's not a knowledge it's Revelation the the chips are going to get low sometimes sure you're going to be attacked because of the word sck what are you going to do about it hello amen will you walk away you know I tell them back home I said you know you let the church have a little trouble and people sometimes if if the church goes through a little turbulence they just miss a week Court too oh yeah you you just don't see them through those little little staggering pain that we go through right but when they hear they get a call that oh the storm is pass yeah then here they are again oh and they're moving so fast you thought that they never pull back yeah come on but I said you know what and me when God called me a pastor he put me on the Hem of it and whatever happened I'm

is right hello somebody Hallelujah I'm identified in it right I'm identified in the greatness I'm identified in the S when the chips are L I'm identified with it because it's still the word of God right so you know brother Dale says something and oh the country don't like it and people start to say everything about it what are you going to do I'm just going to pull back a little bit because Hallelujah but I tell you what if you can't take the heat you got to get out of the kitchen exactly amen hello amen you've got to be identified with something are you there with me you've got to be identified Brethren be certain of God yes be certain this is God you know back home I ain't going to tell them that listen if if if you don't stay with me now you know you're going to be lost right I'm sorry for you if you don't stay in lynon I ain't going to tell him I said listen if you find somewhere where you feel more comfortable I would call the minister and let him welcome you on hello

abely well well I tell you if if you're not here you're lost yeah come on well I tell you they tell people sometimes if you miss a a service or two it seems like you're lost people walk out and and they come again they say oh brother sister it makes no sense you better come to church because hey you're out of it yeah because you know that this was the truth and you oh we welcome them back right amen we welcome yes sir hello and if you go again and you come again we welcome you because you know what I'm just going to preach like everybody made it I going to worry that's right I'm a't going to worry that some I ain't going to I ain't going to go there right right I'm going to beat down the church because you don't walk right I'm going to preach like there is a bride hello because that's what God says hello somebody amen I want to God hallelujah you you look at the display of righteousness and you walk there in it but if you don't walk in it that won't stop me you see we've got to be careful that the people don't push us from our foundation to let us be be constantly be arrogant and angry because somebody don't walk right we're just going to step behind the vein Hallelujah and we're going to preach as high as we possibly can right hello somebody I'm going to tell you that God pledge his word and he can't take back his word are you there with me you know Brethren I personally believe that we going to become the word of God I believe that we're going to walk in the glories of Jesus Christ I believe Brethren like Jesus tell them that day oh when they said but Moses said Jesus said but I say unto you I believe we're going to stand in that same position the world say oh the message but I say unto you because we become one with Jesus Christ amen that's right thank you I believe there's a day coming where we won't worry about sicknesses right exactly amen hello you know every time I I see little baby happy Grace you know I really smile I remember that day when we were all torn up in Brother D said everything's going to be all right I never forget those words everything's going to be all right you know what Rich it couldn't be any other way right that's God's way we just put it all in the hands of God Amen and the Bible said the footsteps of the righteous they are ordered by the Lord you've got to believe that right and there's some signs and flickers that you see sometime some shiny things of life that that's not God's way but if we keep trusting God he pledge his word he pledge his word what a mystery to you and I he pledge his word he's going to build upon this Foundation that's right amen hallelujah amen brother Brandon when you look at Isaac said Abram being a type of God as Isaac was offered Genesis 22 we find out that he carried the wood up the hill yeah and everything portrayed Christ right foreshadowed him Y and then the the ram came and was offered instead right hallelujah amen there's a ram caught in the ticket are you there with me thank you he don't look right but there'll be around C in the God knows exactly what he's doing hello you come in the builds this week but there is a r caught in the ticket for you God knows what he's doing keep pressing on Hallelujah now that's right that was Faith love and Jacob which means a planter and a receiver and we realize that Jacob's life really represent Grace amen Grace unmerited favor Hallelujah because it was a grace of God all the time with Jacob Hallelujah then comes Joseph right Hallelujah there's nothing against Joseph he was Perfection Hallelujah Without a Cause he was sold and in every way his life overshadow the life of Jesus Christ oh that's what he's bringing you and heart to Hallelujah Brethren I ask a question now now but what about my whole Foundation yeah you know sometimes around the message we've got to be careful we glorified all yesterday today that God has brought us to that's right amen but when we started out I never knew battles I I never knew heartache y I never know pain yeah Brethren the things that I've gone through and if you ask me maybe 22 years ago what are you expecting now that you've come to this word oh Hallelujah yeah it's going to be joy and speakable full of Glory yeah Brethren I didn't know you'd be ridicul right yeah I I I didn't know you'd be laughter I didn't know you you had to stand and fight for the very word that is spoken right that the people who say I believe the message I didn't know that I would have to fight for those SP of ground right I would know that I would sit there and listen and my heart bleed because all that try to bring the bride and P the bride in another picture right that is not the word of God right right oh Brethren I I did not know the man would speak without respect to the Bride of Jesus Christ the men would come beyond the old Pulpit never have the experience like Moses had I did not know it right okay Hallelujah but how we need to check back that Foundation amen that's right you know I find it's ironic and might be we have a situation that is unique of every other group that there is in the world yeah that we claim one message oh yeah right but yet we're so diverse right right amen we don't listen to each other right we we don't let them talk yeah yeah and finish their statement because every man's got another absolute right amen hello somebody oh Brethren how privileged we are to be that God pledge his word to right right hallelujah amen hallelujah oh I just take two more close you said that's why we have the trouble that's why you see professed Christians living today they're all right and tomorrow they're all wrong the next thing it's because they never tore the whole Foundation down we got a lot of Baptist that believe exactly lot of Pentecostal that believe hello right and people said oh but I came out of two Soul we've got a lot of Two Souls that believe in the only church that's what they had right but there come some Pharisees that believe but they're still old Pharisees right but they believe yeah yeah never tore the old Foundation down hello somebody right because they want to tell you oh you see but I knew this from way back then yeah oh Brethren I tell you what oh we need to meet to the fire of God yes sir Moses would have brought 40 Years of Herold but God said Moses take off your shoes yeah when when you come into my presence I don't want nothing between me and you brethen it was like an intimate right relationship God and man come together Moses was never the Moses the man the skin that he walking for 40 years meant nothing more to him that brief moment that he spent in the presence of almighty god brother BR said and everything that he had need of everything that moment in the presence of God he got everything right are you there with me oh no wonder what prophet said Hallelujah imagine he said and God gave me the authority back there upon the mountain exactly and in that day when he comes to you you will have the perfect word potentially as your spirit grow and mature as you feed upon the word of God Reverend don't fool yourself your Revelation is by the amount of word that you have received yes sir amen that's Cor hello amen the prophet of God and the church can get further than the pastor if he teach them the word of God right hello wonder the people are unstable that's right going to and from all the old Foundation right it's got to be torn down and when you find the truth everything that was before yeah everything that you had don't wonder are you people are confused cuz they look at your life and here you are but oh they see the symptoms of your yesterday and you never say I was wrong right good brother oh what should they believe amen nobody said that oh that which I walk in before I was wrong but thank God for the truth hello will right all along no I have had another Foundation that was not the word of God and by the grace of God he took me out of that Hallelujah and I broke down that old Foundation oh Simon Peter I preaching in deceiving he said and like newborn babes desirous oh but we're being in the message we're see brother Bram in person that has nothing to do with it that's right exactly amen you could have been to aund services with a pro that had nothing to do with it because right there potentially was laid but it wasn't open to them they didn't know what they were hearing oh Hallelujah even those who came in the presence of almighty God right brother brand had to say to them don't be afraid it is him because they fell to the presence of that great anointing because the angel of the coven was right there on the platform yet they left there and they didn't have much more when they left than when they came there but Brethren what a season that we're living in right hallelujah amen amen when Jesus Christ is preached naturally Hallelujah before the people right brother BR said they never built on Christ Hallelujah Fellowship by Redemption paragraph 135 a mans that got to tore the whole Foundation down right yeah exactly yep if you're going to have a true one you're going to take down the whole ride exactly Hallelujah you can't build on no other Foundation right and so if You Came Upon anything you got to tear that down right what are you talking about your fmer understanding right your fmer belief don't build upon it right amen the hers that you carry with you did you come a day when you said but I was wrong right right but I I had a martal problem hello I had a problem with my baptism I had a problem with my former belief right don't sugar cold the old thing right amen don't build upon that no sir right because if you miss one God at the beginning how can you build on that former understanding hello somebody you know we come and we sit and we hear it oh and we walk through the doors and we we talk about something else and we never say anything about it until we come again we hear it and you become hearers of the word hello somebody but I want to see a people that when they hear it they talk about it Hallelujah the said in utery when they go to their bed at night when they sit up in their houses when they meet to Fellowship they talk about it until it becomes a part of them and they walk in the reality of the revelation of Jesus Christ that has brought them to oh come on Hallelujah where we realize oh God may God of Mercy he said that a man's got to be regenerated and born again and come back to God right amen oh can you be born again in hero no oh could God put a seal upon Herold right hello somebody exactly if there was an hero there then you weren't born again right amen think about it right because the birth is perfect right amen the birth is perfect yes sir and God can't seal that herrow right hello somebody oh that's why we don't come to the altar no more because we don't recognize our position right we don't recognize Amen to walk into this Redemption we've got to separate ourselves between now and then we got to walk away from something right hello amen Oh Glory yes sir and come back to God he said not turning a new page no come on now that's right because if you turn a new page the whole former understanding is on the other page exactly the whole ARA is still there hello somebody exactly and so when somebody say something that you don't like you just go back to it right exactly it hello right and today you said oh that's the best thing I've ever heard but tomorrow where are you right you're right where where you're coming from the B are like a dog back to the V right amen that's right hello are you there with me yes I want you to understand me get it right don't do that don't turn over a new page right Hallelujah it might be good I have nothing against it he said the the good works that you do but that won't do it right that's right that won't do it right that won't do it that won't do it the bride's got to be perfect

what that's not my true birth hell that's what put me in the condition that I'm in that's why I've got to struggle and fight Hallelujah in this house that I live in hello but when I receive the holy ghost from that day on Hallelujah and in that day you will know glory to God Amen it changed my understanding thank you but my former understanding had got to be changed I got to walk away from the whole man are you there with me God got to do the circumcision or to take you out of it right how could you say well well this is the truth and you don't want follow it right hello because you know there's a lot of hero over there yeah but that's where you feed the Bible said for where the caucus is the he will gather together you know spend years trying to get the people to unite try to try try get the people to all be in one place agree as one but I realized it was hard to do are you there with me because you'll never go further than what's in you right no sir hello somebody amen and I
