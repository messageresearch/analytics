[0:06] I think
[0:08] we're so let's turn to 2 Corinthians
[0:12] chapter 6 this the book right before
[0:15] Galatians so it should be pretty easy to
[0:16] get
[0:21] to so like I said I want to I want to
[0:23] talk this morning on communion because
[0:26] what brother Wade has been teaching on
[0:28] for the last year and a half I suppose
[0:30] or I'll have alone is really communion
[0:34] it's it's
[0:36] uh uh we'll get into it in a minute I
[0:38] don't want to get ahead of myself but
[0:40] let's let's read
[0:43] um 2 Corinthians 64 through
[0:54] 18 let's um before we read let's just go
[0:57] to the Lord in prayer Lord God we thank
[0:59] you for your grace to us Lord and the
[1:01] the opportunity together to come
[1:03] together and gather around your word and
[1:06] and to fellowship with Believers Lord
[1:08] Jesus God we pray that you'll be with
[1:10] brother way this morning as he speaks
[1:11] Lord and be all the ones that couldn't
[1:13] be here with us today Lord and Grant it
[1:15] Lord that you'll give health and
[1:16] minister to us Lord Jesus and open our
[1:18] eyes to see your word yes bless us today
[1:21] we pray in your
[1:23] name so let's 2 Corinthians chap 6 verse
[1:28] 14-8
[1:31] 18 be
[1:34] not let me start at verse 11 I'm going
[1:37] to read down to verse 18 oh you
[1:40] Corinthians our mouth is open unto you
[1:42] our heart is
[1:43] enlarged ye are not straightened in us
[1:46] but ye are straightened in your own
[1:49] vows now for a recompense in the same I
[1:52] speak is unto my children be also
[1:55] enlarged be ye not unequally yolked
[1:58] together with unbelievers for what
[2:00] Fellowship hath righteousness with
[2:03] unrighteousness and what communion hath
[2:05] light with
[2:06] darkness and what Concord hath Christ
[2:09] with B what part hath he that believeth
[2:12] with an Infidel and what agreement hath
[2:16] the temple of God with Idols for ye are
[2:19] the Temple of the Living God as God has
[2:21] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[2:24] them and I will be their God and they
[2:26] shall be my people wherefore come out
[2:29] from among them and be separate say the
[2:31] Lord and touch not the unclean thing and
[2:34] I will receive you and will be a father
[2:37] unto you and ye shall be my sons and
[2:39] daughters sayith the Lord Almighty amen
[2:43] so there verse
[2:45] 14 be not unequally yolked together with
[2:49] unbelievers now now there's the thing
[2:52] how how can you know we know we all know
[2:55] the scripture in Amos 3:3 how can two
[2:57] walk together unless they be agreed
[3:00] right how can we walk with God unless
[3:02] we're in
[3:03] agreement how can we have communion with
[3:06] him and uh the the problem you know we
[3:09] all we all know the story of the Garden
[3:11] of Eden how of how communion was severed
[3:14] between us and God because that what
[3:17] happened in the Garden of Eden was that
[3:19] instead
[3:20] of valuing all of the word of God they
[3:23] just took one word and and went one word
[3:26] off one word off and that broke the
[3:29] communion with God and what happened
[3:31] when communion was broken is they lost
[3:33] they lost uh the ability to know what
[3:37] God's Will and purpose was and there's
[3:40] there's so many things wrapped up in
[3:42] communion that when you have communion
[3:44] and fellowship with God you know what
[3:46] his will is you know there's a quote I
[3:50] don't have it right now what brother
[3:52] said the bride will know what God's will
[3:54] is you'll know what God's plan is and
[3:58] you can see God's plan and the St a
[4:00] perfect man how he's he's he's he's
[4:03] moving Us in in close closer and closer
[4:07] fellowship with him with in communion
[4:10] through a growth process it starts off
[4:12] like kind of like we're we're apart from
[4:14] God and he he brings us together by
[4:17] justification
[4:18] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:22] begin growing up the statue of perfect
[4:24] man adoption and and at the end of the
[4:27] process you're you have true Oneness of
[4:30] unity with God true communion now that's
[4:35] what real communion is is where you're
[4:38] you're in agreement you understand one
[4:40] another you can't uh that was that's the
[4:43] whole problem of how how can somebody
[4:47] that's in darkness and the light of the
[4:50] world how can they walk together and
[4:53] that's what God is trying to do he's
[4:55] trying to bring us together into
[4:57] Fellowship so that so that he can make
[4:59] his great plan and purpose
[5:02] known so he can give us a part in it he
[5:05] gives us and in that message brother R
[5:07] preached what was the Holy Ghost given
[5:09] for he said the Holy Ghost was given so
[5:12] that you know when he was when when they
[5:14] were leaving the Garden of Eden that
[5:17] that same God that was crying out I'm
[5:19] going to make a way now is crying out
[5:22] from within your heart to call the
[5:25] Believers to the message that you've
[5:27] heard and you have a part in it you have
[5:31] a and that's why there's a desire in the
[5:33] believer's heart that to so that other
[5:35] people can hear the word they hear the
[5:37] truth because now you're in communion
[5:40] with
[5:41] God now you know uh I really started
[5:45] studying on kind of in the line of a
[5:48] conversation with god because that's
[5:49] what really what communion is it's not
[5:52] you know many people you have a you
[5:53] you'll have a conversation we call it a
[5:55] conversation that ends up being
[5:57] one-sided and and sometimes
[6:00] ministers kind of like to do that that
[6:01] you talk to a minister sometimes it's
[6:03] been my experience many times that it
[6:05] ends up almost being one-sided there
[6:08] they're pouring a lot of information on
[6:10] you and you kind of stand there that's
[6:13] right and uh but but a real conversation
[6:17] is is back and forth there's got to be a
[6:20] response there's got to be and and you
[6:23] look at that that conversation between
[6:25] Jesus and Nicodemus Nicodemus came to
[6:27] him at night and they had a conversation
[6:29] Nicodemus would ask a question and Jesus
[6:31] would tell it to him the woman at the
[6:33] well they had a little conversation and
[6:35] that's how brother brand said that he
[6:37] would uh he would have a little
[6:39] conversation in the prayer lines to get
[6:40] in touch with people's Spirit to get to
[6:43] get a fix on what their problem was now
[6:48] before you can have a
[6:50] conversation you got
[6:53] to what you talking about you got to
[6:55] have something to agree on now now
[6:59] there's many brothers I I I can't after
[7:02] the the new year as a brother U
[7:05] mentioned to me he said my you should
[7:07] have seen that Alabama game I I don't I
[7:11] don't know nothing I can't have a
[7:13] conversation about that I can you know
[7:15] at work sometimes I I we'll just have a
[7:17] little game I'll fake it you know I'll
[7:19] say Bo if they just bring it together if
[7:22] they just can bring their realistic
[7:23] synergies together that really do it
[7:25] this
[7:27] year and you can fake it you know
[7:30] but um I I can't really have a
[7:33] conversation because I don't know what
[7:35] they're talking about and and you know
[7:38] even with with with anything fishing or
[7:40] anything you know you you got to have a
[7:44] common ground right now you can't uh to
[7:48] see what God's doing he's bringing us up
[7:50] a growth process and he starts you off
[7:53] with justification and you begin to have
[7:55] a little conversation you say I've got
[7:57] communion because like Martin he looked
[8:00] at Romans 7:17 and and he said now I
[8:03] know that I'm not saved by my works when
[8:07] he had uh he was beginning to have a
[8:09] little conversation with god but the the
[8:11] growth the plan is not finished yet he
[8:15] he's grow he's bringing us on up to
[8:18] where he can really have we really know
[8:22] what's going on we he can really commune
[8:25] with us and and we're in in tune and and
[8:29] we're
[8:32] and what happened in the Garden of Eden
[8:35] was they got one word off and it it
[8:39] caused everything to be on edge and now
[8:42] that's how it is brother R A lot of
[8:45] times you almost can't talk about these
[8:48] kind of topics without bringing in home
[8:50] life and because he used so many
[8:54] examples about a man and his wife Christ
[8:57] and his bride
[9:00] how
[9:00] can if if you have a home life where the
[9:03] the man and the wife the husband and
[9:05] wife are not in agreement everything is
[9:08] going to be an edge just it's going to
[9:10] be uh like maybe this is a bad example
[9:13] but sometimes my wife and I disagree on
[9:16] uh what temperature of the house should
[9:18] be and it
[9:20] just I you know if it was up to me maybe
[9:23] I'd put um I'd just load up that wood
[9:26] stove and have it at 90°
[9:29] but uh and Monica likes to have the
[9:31] windows all thrown open whether if it's
[9:34] 30° at night
[9:38] well
[9:42] my so you got to you got to be an
[9:47] agreement and and and you
[9:50] know in that case we we come to an
[9:53] agreement cuz I I'll put on a lot of
[9:55] extra clothes a big old sweater or
[9:58] whatever and that you know that brings
[9:59] us to agreement but that's not how God
[10:02] does it he brings us to agreement he he
[10:05] brings us from light to Darkness from
[10:08] from Darkness to light by shining his
[10:11] light on us the light of his word and
[10:14] making it come to life in our hearts now
[10:17] now there's the there's the key if if we
[10:19] got
[10:21] the we we uh the danger is knowing a lot
[10:26] because having the truth he said John
[10:29] chapter 4 that we the we've got to
[10:32] worship Christ in spirit and truth right
[10:35] amen it take it it it takes a
[10:39] combination right if you just got if you
[10:41] just know a lot then and then uh and
[10:44] Paul said in Corinthians that that
[10:46] knowledge puffeth up you begin to uh I
[10:50] was reading this message where brother R
[10:51] began to talk about how
[10:53] that what what knowledge does is it
[10:56] causes complexes it causes people one
[10:59] one's bigger than the other one's you
[11:01] know it makes everybody uh at different
[11:05] different levels and things and but when
[11:08] you're in agreement with it when you're
[11:09] in communion with God it puts
[11:12] everybody in in one
[11:15] Fellowship by one Spirit by one Faith by
[11:18] one baptism amen we can all come
[11:21] together and true communion brings us
[11:23] into fellowship with God and to
[11:25] fellowship with one another because now
[11:27] we have something in common
[11:30] that we can Fellowship around right
[11:32] there's something in agreement with us
[11:34] something that binds us together and you
[11:36] know I I was thinking about this the
[11:38] other night when some of the brothers
[11:40] got over the house and we were just kind
[11:42] of sitting around and you start talking
[11:44] maybe somebody be talking about fishing
[11:46] or somebody be talking about football
[11:47] and everything but then there's that
[11:49] almost magical moment when the topic
[11:52] shifts yeah to the word and somebody
[11:55] says I was reading over in Romans or
[11:58] something about this scriptures that
[12:00] just really means so much to me and it
[12:02] just really Quicken the other day or or
[12:05] can did you remember what brother Dale
[12:06] was talking about and and there's the
[12:09] thing that we can really Fellowship
[12:12] together that's the thing that we have
[12:15] agreement with God on agreement with one
[12:17] another on you know I believe that that
[12:21] the bride is coming together in true
[12:24] Oneness right God is is it's the Holy
[12:27] Spirit doing it it's not something you
[12:28] can do yourself it's the the work of the
[12:31] holy spirit before the the day of
[12:34] Pentecost all the Believers were in
[12:37] Discord there was some trying to can we
[12:39] sit at your right hand can we do this
[12:42] who's going to be the biggest who's the
[12:44] greatest among all your
[12:45] disciples and then what brought them
[12:49] together was when the spirit fell they
[12:51] were all in one Accord yes that
[12:54] everything the atmosphere was just in in
[12:56] the right place and they all came into
[13:00] communion and that's what brings
[13:02] communion so now now the question I'm
[13:05] not really talking about the Lord suffer
[13:08] but I think that uh maybe by the end of
[13:10] this little series you'll it it might
[13:13] help answer some questions when can I
[13:16] take the communion are you in agreement
[13:20] with God's word how can two walk
[13:23] together unless they agree you can say
[13:25] well I I know what brother brandham
[13:27] taught I nod your head but does your
[13:30] life agree does everything agree does it
[13:33] completely match up matching pieces is
[13:37] everything just in in perfect
[13:42] alignment and that's you know brother I
[13:46] got to thinking I just made a little
[13:47] note about this and I I just want to
[13:48] comment because brother Brandon said
[13:50] when he was in a prayer line he would
[13:51] begin to talk to somebody to try to get
[13:54] in touch with their Spirit now
[13:56] discernment is a is a is a interest in
[13:59] topic you know brother BR said every
[14:01] believer should have should be able to
[14:03] discern between right and wrong you
[14:06] should be able to know whether something
[14:08] is right or wrong and he also said you
[14:10] can talk to somebody for a little bit
[14:12] and tell because out of the heart the
[14:15] MTH from out of the heart the mouth
[14:16] speaketh whether they've got the Holy
[14:18] Ghost how is that how does that work
[14:20] because in the beginning they got out of
[14:23] communion by denying one word of God and
[14:26] when you talk to somebody and they begin
[14:27] to make excuses for why they cannot why
[14:31] their family can't follow the word why
[14:33] they can't follow the word make excuses
[14:35] for not obeying the scripture what show
[14:38] it plainly and then they begin it just
[14:42] shows that there's something wrong now I
[14:44] I don't I I don't believe that uh you
[14:48] know I I mentioned this before I I would
[14:50] never go up to somebody and say you have
[14:52] the Holy Ghost or you don't have the
[14:54] Holy Ghost because it's got to be a
[14:56] personal revelation I can't tell you you
[14:59] whether you've got to take communion or
[15:01] not or or things like that but
[15:04] uh when when the Holy Ghost is when the
[15:08] when the Born Again experience is active
[15:10] in your life it will begin to make you
[15:12] line up with the word yes and it's a big
[15:15] red flag if you say well the Bible says
[15:18] this but you know I I'm going to
[15:21] continue on in my way because the
[15:24] there's a promise in the scripture that
[15:25] says it will lead and guide you to all
[15:27] truth amen it will make you line up it
[15:30] makes these virtues be active in your
[15:33] life it makes them be it makes you be
[15:36] fruitful yes you remember brother said
[15:38] your fruit is your Doctrine it makes the
[15:40] doctrine that you have heard come to
[15:42] life and live in
[15:45] you
[15:48] now we got about 15 or so
[15:54] minutes uh let's see I was going to put
[15:58] this on the screen
[15:59] cuz I'm kind of
[16:01] comparing true
[16:03] communion with
[16:05] knowledge maybe that's kind of what
[16:08] we're we're talking about and I I I
[16:10] don't know if you can see this this is
[16:12] uh I don't expect you to read the words
[16:14] or anything but this is a little pyramid
[16:15] this is what the the thing that they
[16:17] used in schools today to kind of
[16:19] instruct teachers of how they should
[16:22] bring up kids and this this is also a
[16:25] pyramid but it's a pyramid of
[16:27] knowledge it's not a pyramid of what
[16:30] God's doing it's a pyramid remember in
[16:31] the Garden of Eden they had a choice
[16:33] between to take God's way or to take
[16:35] knowledge now in this pyramid there's
[16:37] knowledge and this pyramid there's
[16:39] knowledge yes there's this kind of
[16:41] knowledge and this kind of knowledge the
[16:44] bottom the bottom on this period is
[16:46] knowledge and then it goes up to
[16:48] comprehension application let's see how
[16:51] we can apply the things that we have
[16:53] learned I'm not trying to make a doctor
[16:55] or anything I'm just kind of ill to
[16:57] illustrate something analysis synthesis
[17:00] and the Very Peak is
[17:02] evaluation
[17:06] so you know man we could if if you're
[17:09] trying you'll never be able to figure it
[17:11] out you'll never be able to to uh they
[17:15] could never figure out Matthew
[17:17] 28:19 but on the day of Pentecost when
[17:20] the spirit fell then what they could not
[17:23] figure out they got the revelation of
[17:26] and Peter came out and said I now I know
[17:28] know who I've been talking to all this
[17:30] time that I know who how we should be
[17:33] baptized I know the way into the into
[17:36] the the body of
[17:38] Christ now thinking about conversation
[17:42] called communion is a conversation I
[17:44] went back in the uh you know whenever
[17:46] whenever you bring out strong
[17:47] concordance everybody kind of gets that
[17:49] Sleepy Eye you look so
[17:52] don't you I I went back to look at the
[17:56] definition of what conversation means in
[17:59] the Greek and the Hebrew and this was
[18:01] really interesting so don't fall asleep
[18:03] on me and don't get cross
[18:06] out but a conversation is not just a
[18:09] dialogue but it also means the way of
[18:13] life of life it means the manner of Life
[18:18] your conduct
[18:20] behavior and uh there's another word
[18:23] similar to there there's a couple of
[18:24] words in the Greek Lexicon that
[18:27] means uh one means means the manner of
[18:29] Life conduct Behavior another one means
[18:31] to live to abide to behave
[18:36] oneself to conduct oneself behave
[18:39] oneself
[18:41] live and in the Old Testament the Hebrew
[18:44] Leon conversation means your manner your
[18:48] habit your
[18:49] way the course of life and your moral
[18:55] character so I believe what God is doing
[18:58] when he communes with us he's taking his
[19:01] the conversation of his mouth and
[19:04] bringing it down into our hearts so that
[19:06] it can live that life can live in us
[19:08] that's uh let's turn over to 2
[19:10] Corinthians chapter 4
[19:20] that's there it
[19:24] is this is so beautiful how true
[19:27] communion always starts starts in in
[19:30] secret there's all these scriptures that
[19:32] say that what God does and it
[19:34] something's done in secret and then is
[19:36] made manifest you go into your prayer
[19:40] closet and and have private communion
[19:42] with God and then it's made manifest in
[19:44] the open communion with God happens in a
[19:47] secret place with one a one-on-one thing
[19:50] with just you and God in your like
[19:53] brother R said in that bedroom chamber
[19:56] where there's something going on
[19:57] personal with you God that nobody else
[20:00] knows about let's read verse three 2
[20:04] Corinthians 4:3 but if our gospel be hid
[20:09] it is hid to them that are lost and whom
[20:11] the God of this world ha blinded the
[20:14] minds of them which believe not lest the
[20:16] light of the Glorious gospel of Christ
[20:18] who is the image of God should shine
[20:21] under
[20:24] them for we preach not ourselves but
[20:27] Christ Jesus the Lord and our eles your
[20:29] servants for Jesus sake for God who
[20:31] commanded the light to shine out of
[20:33] Darkness hath shined in our hearts to
[20:37] give the light of the knowledge of the
[20:39] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[20:42] now remember a few chapters over we read
[20:44] about how how can Darkness and Light
[20:47] walk together now that's what's going on
[20:49] here he has shown the light of the
[20:52] Gospel into our hearts to convert US
[20:55] from vessels of Dishonor into vessels of
[20:57] Honor yes to bring us into perfect
[20:59] communion now now there's the the key
[21:02] you say I'm Justified I'm in communion
[21:05] that's what brother R said you're
[21:07] Justified you're in communion but that's
[21:10] not the end of the story right I'm
[21:12] Sanctified I'm in communion I got a mar
[21:15] John Wesley I got a a higher Revolution
[21:18] Evol revelation of the word but that's
[21:21] not the end of the story keep going up
[21:23] Aza Street a messenger came well now you
[21:27] got to hear you got to hear the message
[21:29] you got to eat the book and it's got to
[21:32] it's bringing you into perfect communion
[21:35] perfect Fai a perfect knowledge of who
[21:39] he is and who you are because that's
[21:42] what the books of this uh the the
[21:44] letters on this page are testifying of
[21:47] is that God's got a bride he's got
[21:49] somebody that he's going to manifest
[21:51] himself in all
[21:55] right my computer's not working again
[22:01] let
[22:06] see that was another scripture I wanted
[22:08] to read right before we
[22:17] end well I I barely got through any of
[22:19] these
[22:25] those you know what I'm going to stop
[22:28] right there let just read 1 John 1:
[22:32] 5-7 and that says you going to have to
[22:34] turn to it says this then is the message
[22:37] which we have heard of him and declare
[22:39] unto you that God is light and in him is
[22:42] no darkness of at all if we say that we
[22:46] have fellowship with him and walk in
[22:49] darkness we lie and do not the
[22:52] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[22:55] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[22:57] with another and the blood of Jesus
[23:00] Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
[23:04] so next time we're going to continue on
[23:06] this thought is my plan and we're going
[23:09] to look at how God brings us into
[23:11] perfect fellowship with him cuz we've
[23:13] been you know brother Way's been
[23:15] teaching us on the stature of a perfect
[23:17] man um but I want to kind of look at uh
[23:20] I'm going to switch over to
[23:22] Ezekiel 37 you know everybody knows what
[23:26] Ezekiel 36 is right that I'll give you a
[23:29] new heart new spirit Ezekiel 37 takes
[23:33] those dry
[23:34] bones and brings them to life and how
[23:36] does he do it how are we brought into
[23:40] communion with by the word by the
[23:43] speaking of the word by the we've heard
[23:45] a prophet in this last day is being
[23:48] preached to us we can put the tape in
[23:49] the tape player and press play and it's
[23:52] it's growing us into the fullness of the
[23:54] stature of of Christ himself
[23:58] amen and I think we're all well first
[24:01] that so we'll just uh stop right there
[24:03] God bless you
