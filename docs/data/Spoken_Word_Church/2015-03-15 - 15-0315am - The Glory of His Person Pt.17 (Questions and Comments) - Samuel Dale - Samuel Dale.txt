========================================

hey man good morning everybody it's a blessed time to be and as this song was saying i'd rather have jesus than anything it's it's so much the world offers but none of it will get you plus this world so it's just you know i always keep jesus on our mind in our heart and keep desiring that we fulfill our lives with him we're going to read this morning from psalm 118 verses 1 through 14. let us pray heavenly father again we are grateful love this opportunity to be presence in your house of worship lord we are praying that your holy spirit is filling every heart father father we have need of god we look unto you for it lord we ask you to bless us lord to give us strength continually lord things that we don't understand lord we pray that you would bring them to our minds and bring them let us understand lord for whatever it is lord if anything troubles in the heart father we ask that you would remove it if any sickness is in anybody father we pray that you were healed god we know that this is an hour late time so father just let us be prepared for your arrival in jesus name we pray amen psalm 118 oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever let the house of aaron say his mercy endureth forever i call upon the lord in distress the lord answered me and set me in a large place the lord taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall i see my desire upon them to hate me it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in princesses they can pass me about but the name of the lord will i destroy them thou has trusted sore at me i might fall but the lord helped me the lord is my strength and my song may have become my salvation you maybe see that yes i want to see open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to shining amen shining in the light of your glory amen yes your holy amen and amen and amen i want to see you good to see everybody in the house of the lord and to have all the company with us we always say you come one time you're part of us so i guess you're just part of us anyway but hope we don't miss any visitors because we always welcome them i'm glad to see everybody amen if you like turn in your scriptures oh they're special okay okay all right let's having to i won't find out if wade wanted to make his report this coming wednesday or sunday whatever he said he'd rather wait and try to get all his pictures together and then he could do it that way so we'll we'll do it on that form all right so but glad to have everybody as i say if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 1 genesis 1 and then genesis 2. what we're going to do is i'm going to just try to review back over basically what i've been covering and then we will have questions and answers and then if they run on into it we'll take it up this afternoon too so you know whatever it will take all right remember the fellowship meeting now will be this coming saturday 3 30. so man you know come and have a good time with us brother matthew bray will be preaching the saturday night and at least to sunday morning services so remember these and and come and we'll have a good time fellowshipping together i hope we'll have a crowded house we may have to uh open up downstairs some but we pray the lord would bless us all right i think he's at all announcements we always miss something so definitely father we thank you lord for your grace your love your understanding thank you for all things we just asked you this morning that you would come among us in a mighty way in order that you would open your word unto us that we may see you and follow after lord then through that opening of the word we know and realize you said you would send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction there's many things among us many sicknesses and many things that are going on that satan is just hindered on ever hindering on every hand that he can but we pray that you would just come on the scene because you said it and we believe it said when the enemy comes in like a flood you'd raise up a standard so thank you lord for the standard just make yourself manifest now among us have your way as we read your word you come and bless us and guide us forgive our sins and bless each one bless wade lord as he's winding down there in jamaica and be i mean in the philippines and he'll be flying back in coming home tuesday the lord willing and we pray that you'd bless in all things he's given some good reports and we believe you and we thank you in jesus name amen we'll read these and then we'll just have comments and questions and things revelations 1 12 it says and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clove the garment down to the foot and gird about the palps with a golden girdle now some of the visitors may say well hey he read that the last time i was here and you come back in another three months and i'll probably read it again because we're we haven't yet got to the point that we're wanting to own this you know the glory of his person but we'll get there eventually all right genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them notice now created he him them that's all but just keep that in mind okay so we'll go on over to the points where we can cover the up to where we're at genesis 2 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed amen you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we'll try to just speak for a little bit and cover some things and just review and then you write down your questions and all and we'll try to have you know questions and comments upon what we're talking about what has been our thought for all of this time you know basically covering is to see how real that god is you know you say well brother dale all of my life i've just heard god as a spirit well that's good that's bible but do you think he's just a spirit to just no form i mean back before the foundation of the world as we talked of back in the eternities where brother brown said he was elohim and dwelt alone you know are you thinking it was just a spirit back there well remember the prophet says we covered these things that god is a being he is not like the wind he is a person all right think of god as being real as i say to you you mean to think that you are something well then whatever who created is greater than you are no matter what greatness we think we are there has to be a creator all right and in seeing that we've seen that he he wanted to reveal himself so he began to condescend downward to where that he would be able to make known himself because how would we understand as the prophet said the one who covers all space and time and eternity how could you comprehend god the best you do is the spirit well i hope that that's sunk in enough on you to talk about a spiritual being instead of just a spirit like the wind just blowing around and just because remember he is not omnipresent because he's a being that's the way the prophet explained it now he is omnipresent only in the basis that he's omniscient that he knows all things and by knowing all things then he can be wherever he needs to be right to be present all right but he's a being that's that's my point my whole thought is to try to get us to looking at the reality of god and seeing how real he is maybe you'd never considered god as being a person but why not he is the only person i like the way the prophet said it one day he said he's not the second third person second person he said he's not even the first person he said he is the person all right because he's the first person that could mean there can be more persons but when he's the only person then there's only one true and living god we don't believe in trinitarianism we claim to be away from that as to believe the message of the hour and and you know settling down to that point that we say we believe in one god well how do you believe about that god what is your thoughts about that god as i always say is your god real well i've never seen him well you probably never will in that attitude but why not look around because as we covered the scripture that even the eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see you know look out in life and look at the birds the animals the trees and things then you realize there's got to be a creator somewhere for all of that to come from all right well see he's real he's a person right it's not just something that we well you know i don't know where he's at i don't know what you can talk to him anytime you want to telephones never busy all you got to do is dial him up start praying all right because he'll be there when you want him to be there but he's real all right then we found out to to try to jump over hurry and back up some to the man we found out that god never sent a son to die he came himself then you'll say well my god can't die well you tell me what happened see as i always try to tell you i can cut i can blow your head slap off but i can't kill you because you're going to go somewhere else and you're going to abide until god can do that because he's the only one that can destroy the soul of mankind but see then one day he came and when the fall came then he came in human flesh to live up on earth and the bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily all right in him was father son and holy ghost dwelling there because that's what it takes now and remember how we express that if you do away with either one father son holy ghost see then you're going to make it either a trinity or you're going to make it a oneness me but just don't do that leave it the way it is you've got to have father son and holy ghost to make the one true and living god that's not three persons that's not three uh personalities or anything that's three manifestations of the same god all right i'm a human the things we see we can see the eternal god i'm a human i'm a father i'm a you know a grandfather i can have many many manifestations about me but i'm only one person all right we claim to believe those but do we make him then real well i don't know maybe when we get up to heaven we'll see him well that's true if that's our thoughts that's the only place we'll see him and he might be sitting on the throne somewhere judging us too so that might be the wrong way to get to see him all right see i believe he's real it wasn't on the day of pentecost that the baptism of the holy ghost just floated down and just like the wind you know it says it it set on each one of them in tongues of fire on each one he's real all right well see when he come into human flesh we don't look at that as being a three god idea we see that god was in christ the bible said reconcile in the world and to himself all right then we look at it as being that he was the one that was the creator because remember now you remember how we brought it out because you talk about a creation you got to have a creator and remember according to john 1 hebrews 1 colossians 1 james 3 and 9 all things were made by him and he's the word right he was the word that made all things all right that's jesus christ not jesus of flesh there's no such thing all right see then you can't have eternal sonships that won't work but you can have he got eternal godship you can have an eternal godhead because that's who he is all right see then we'd look at him as being real and find out the reality of understanding god and and you know standing there with and to who was it philip he said you know show us the father that it suffice or satisfy us he said have i been so long with you he said if you've seen me you've seen the father you know what right there stood the father in flesh all right now we brought it out in a little bit but didn't bring out much because we're going to hit on a little bit more in some more messages but you see then he was what body of creation hebrews 10 5 a body thou hast prepared me all right but in soul he was god amen in spirit he was god so that wasn't just an ordinary man standing there we'll get back to it in a minute remember adam was had to be body spirit and soul adam then god breathed into his nostrils and he'd become a living soul but jesus wasn't just body spirit and soul or something like a body in and a spirit or something and then a soul came in he was soul and spirit both eternal god the spirit that was in him was the spirit in sundry times and in diverse manners according to hebrews that spoke to in the prophets all right so it wasn't just a human being standing there it was the eternal god might manifest as i said a moment ago then he didn't send a son to die he came himself he said well now you're going into you're trying to get us away from trinity but it looks like you're going into oneness no as long as you hold it to the point of father son and holy spirit you know and keep that in manifestations you won't go into the oneness doctrine but if you don't you've already gone there because the one that's doctor is one like your finger that's basically all it did old testament new testament back there with jesus and now see and that there's never another uh form of god outside of jesus christ but i differ with that point there because highly with the oneness on that one because i that's where i see they totally go wrong right the oneness believed that jesus was the life's manifestation of god i don't believe that i believe on the day of pentecost the bride become a manifestation of god right i believe that holy ghost being still given to us as a new birth makes us a manifestation of god i don't believe it ended there see that's oneness all right so then you come into to trying to understand see that when we're not trinity we're not oneness we're staying with the scripture of one true and living god but made manifest in many forms because remember he had many attributes in him that was for the foundation of the world that was back when he was self-existing amen now if we're going to believe that correctly then self-existing meaning existed alone right all right see then being that being self-existing he had thoughts those thoughts was his attributes then in and then we see him see he wanted to be a healer he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted all of those things that was his desire all right we see him in manifestation now coming over on the other side into life all right but he never gained any attributes by coming into the world he had those attributes in him he just started displaying them all right and in doing that he had to bring forth as we read in genesis 1 that he created man in his own image male and female created he him male and female created he them the bible doesn't have any problems talking like that we have problems trying to understand all right so we found that that man that he created that he made in his own image was not the genesis ii man that was made in the image image of animal but it was a spiritual being in his image then what is god you know man what is god then he he's real and see that he he created something real well we found out that that was not a creation like we talk we want to use the word creations or beginnings or startings or something no the bible calls them in revelation 3 14 the beginning of the creation of god all right but see where did god have a beginning using both words beginning and creation in the same verse we think about it have it as something that's got to start why not think about it as when god is coming into view to our to our understanding to where we can comprehend him that he could start condescending downward that we would be able to see and understand all right are you following me then see then he made the man first in his spiritual image we found that was made before the foundation of the world the genesis 2 man is the flesh man right right but it was made after coming on over see that that man that was created back there then was a very um odd-looking product i guess you'd call it because he made that man male and female and we covered how that brother branham said that even after adam was you know in theophany in the garden to lead the animals as that 126 man that he was put in flesh but part of his being was left in theophany which was eve then see he could take the rib from adam because he was created in the spiritual part he was in adam and in the physical part eve was in adam all right see then eve being in adam and physical you could take a rib out and make a body and that's what he done but where did her soul and our being come from see then we went through it you know and and trying to not to spend so much time that to me that man that was made in genesis 1 26 and 27 is the christ i tried to explain that that's the christ that's how come that it was made in the male and female part not not like a uh perverted idea we would have today as somebody come forth with products of men and products of women and we call it a male and a female they got a big old word in their fart we ain't supposed to be using too much but you know but see it's not that away he was in adam in spiritual creation all right then eve was in adam in the physical creation all right see her being her her her part to make to where it would be a another person was placed into that body all right i want to get to that this evening more where we talk about the fall because i wanted this questions and answered it out of the way to kind of see where you're standing or what your thoughts are and then we'll start into the fall this afternoon the lord willing to talk about it all right but you understand then man made in the image of god even in his fallen estate he's a little creator he's always working and doing things and building things different and the bible says the imagination of man's mind is continually evil right the things we make have always been something to kill us with they made guns killed a lot of people made cars kill more than the guns made planes kill more all right because see what we make is a perversion we take something put it together that's not a creation but see neither was even adam a creation in the spiritual part as to be something made you know it was the christ you can't explain it i went through it with you you can't take the the uh human life mankind and say that they're made male and female that'd be a perverted generation right so you can't use that for all mankind all mankind wasn't made male and female but this one that started was made that away why simple terminology when it finishes it'll finish with christ in the church right there's male and female when this finishes god's plan and what he had in his mind it'll wind up with being christ in the church which is male and female adam and eve were just the type of that to show what god was going to bring because she was in him spiritually and then she was in him physically all right and see that's in the image of god you say is god male and female we don't go into that doctrine they had in florida years ago about the the uh you know male female and male holy ghost i don't believe none of that because you got two people when you do that a lot of you don't even know that that was a doctrine but it was our and probably still is going with a lot of people they want to call it a male and female holy ghost i differed one brother about it i said brother you you'd be making god a messed up thing you'd make him male and female and you better not do that you're getting it over too far he's not male and female you say no no because see when jesus christ did on earth he was pure male. and you and i the prophet said was in him but now we wasn't physically in him come on so as god he was god he was male not a female male and female we as being his offspring is the part that brings forth the feminist part of it as the church but it can't be two holy ghosts that you'd mess it up it can only be christ made manifest in a church because christ is the only one you can talk about male and female did you follow that that was one of the life's messages christ is the only way you can talk about male female in one product you can't talk about it because that's what it said we wasn't even in jesus physically the only thing that we could be in jesus was the part of the eternal life that he had right all right see then it wouldn't work out because you can't do with that you can't take this and say well mankind has made male 1 no mankind is not made male and female adam was the only one made that away and we'll get to it this afternoon maybe as to what that is because if you mess it up in body you've messed it up you mess it up in seoul you messed up you better hold on to the right point all right but are you following me now see then the man was made in the image of god male and female all right then he was put in flesh male and female then the female was taken from the mail not that adam was standing there as a pervert male and female in that we'll get to it this evening maybe it'll clear it up some you better get away from that body trying to make it a male and female body he only took a part of that body he didn't saw him in hif and say well this is the man and this is the one not exactly he only took a rib to make to where adam could say this is now flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone that's true but you know eve was a separate identity physically because she was a human being all right but are you listening now get the point then we'll get to the questions and answers maybe i preach enough to make enough questions what do you think about adam and eve what do you think about them as how that they were my aide and what they were all right maybe that'll bring up some questions from some of you but the main thing is to get back to the genesis 1 26 man where brother branham said that was the theophany man all right was that man real or was it just a spirit see i'm trying to get you to realize what you are and you know what i can blow you apart i can destroy the body the spirit would have to leave that as the scripture would say and go back to god who gave it all right it's all right not go back at some sinful point he can't take it back that way but the soul lives on mankind can't destroy your soul the bible plainly tells you that don't fear him that can destroy the body but says fear him that can destroy the soul all right see the soul is the real you right the soul is the real you that's what you are because soul means being person and that's what you are you're a person yes all right we'll get to where you get your identities later maybe in the spirit realm of where you start this and define a lot of things i'm just wanting to get the point if god is real then your soul is real and your soul would be the point that would be made in the image of god your body's made in the image of animal your spirit is just a mediator between the two you know a workable part to make it work makes your body work all right but are you understanding the series that i'm trying to bring is to try to get us to see how real god is and then by doing that to see if man is made in the image he's not made in another likeness somewhere i tried to explain that we talk about image or likeness that man in genesis 1 26 and 27 would have to be the spirit man the christ but then he was put in flesh in 2 7. all right now that's the only time that could happen now when you come with christ you know jesus when he came he wasn't male and female in a perverted way of thinking about it and the prophet would say we were in christ as he walked the shores of god but what part of us was there the only eternal life the only thing could be the eternal life that you have all right see then he can come back to make it christ in the church true all right now we're back to what he meant for to be let me cover this part and then you get ready for the question see god wanted to be able to or to bring mankind into being you remember the last one we read and i said don't get tied up in your thinking so much see we say god made angels and they worshiped him that made him god that was not the worship he wanted you remember the last quotes there the other day what was it he made man he wants to worship from his offspring angels is wonderful they're flying around him all day long screaming and hollering right singing wonderful i'm telling it right but his ear is not tuned to them his ear is tuned to your voice he'd rather have the worshiped in our worst form i guess you would call it from his children than the worship of all of those angels because we're his offspring amen you know your true offspring is a wonderful thing right yes and then you say well i love the neighbors kids and i don't know but they're not like your offspring if there is there's something messed up in your thinking it's supposed to be your offspring first and then you can love everybody else and i understand those things but you're following me now god's original plan was to have his offspring that's the perfect will of god for not for sin you can't make the perfect will of god being that he won't he was going to bring sin into being i'll try to cover that this afternoon more sin came into being as a permissive will sin is not a perfect wheel see he wanted us to come right to begin with we were the ones that failed you remember where i gave it off the spoken words original seed darling last sunday where we were talking about it or wednesday where brother random said being born by the word and spirit brings you back like you should have been in the beginning you just think what a beautiful thing it would have been for sin to not been in the picture right and we would have come without sin of course everybody wouldn't come you know all these human beings wouldn't have come it would have only been the offspring of god right it wouldn't have been no foolish virgins there wouldn't have been a sealed jew to be given eternal life there wouldn't have been nothing like that it would have just been his offspring all right and then by bringing it that away though you say well why didn't he keep it that way because he had those attributes in him amen there's no way he could be a savior couldn't be a healer he couldn't be a father the way he wanted to be mean not like the real the way he wanted he could be a father by creation but remember he created the angels that didn't make him father right that made him just god to say a object of worship all right he had many of those attributes in him that could never have been displayed so we don't glory in the fall no let's don't go that far well look at it then god's not too mad at me because he wanted it to be like this no he didn't want it to be like this he knew it would be like this there's a whole lot of difference in wanting it to be and knowing what it'll be so he had to allow man to come into a sinful condition not make us sinful you realize if he made you sinful he cannot judge you for being sinful that ought to be a sensible statement if he made you wrong he can't judge you for being wrong because he made you that way but he didn't make us wrong he made us right we were the ones that went wrong we'll cover more this evening on that but i'm just getting the point just to thought do you believe god is real do you believe that you're real do you know that if they wouldn't but one person in the world jesus christ would have still died to give that person eternal life you realize that but look what he's getting by the fallen condition there's going to be a lot of people in heaven because of the bride that fail as i said we don't glory in the fall with glory in the savior he didn't plan this to be let me get that part before we go he didn't plan this to be he just knew if he made us the way it would be is that hard to understand he didn't make it to be wrong that's where people mess up you know i see it so much of the people the message it's hardest for me to stay away from it even here that i want to get into this afternoon people think that eve was made some kind of a by-product that made her a sex sexual product of a fact of all she was just you know lustful product well if god made her that way he can't judge her right if he made you girls wrong your sisters if he made you wrong he can't judge you for being wrong so we know better than that she was made perfect and right right wasn't anything wrong with the body that's what women are sold by products you don't even know what the word byproduct means look it up in the dictionary it means simply an a model compared to a town hall town house i really call it cart and what big forward it means something of greater value or equal value or greater value if you've looked up the word byproduct but see we've got it all that we want to beat the women to death because of them being what they are we'll get to it this afternoon maybe it'll clear up a lot of things there wasn't anything wrong with ev's body there wasn't nothing wrong with their soul yeah we'll get out to think on some things but the main thing i want you to see is how real god is and then see how real you are and to think about that man made in the image of god doesn't mean some likeness to look like god or something that means god in another form that product he made in the garden was christ it's going to finish his christ because that's christ in the church because adam and eve started it what about it what do you think about it which one of these is the most alive i see a purple and an orange who's got the blue over here all right who'll be first on the questions and answers surely by all of this 16 sermons somebody ought to have a question sister trudy all right now remember microphone next to mouth where everybody can hear okay um i have a lot but i'll try to keep it simple last sunday when i left you i left here really confused because of the things that you brought out in genesis 1 26 127. now little by little it has been revealed though i understand little by little i haven't got the whole picture yet but slowly we going okay so my first question was um 1 john 6 1 26 27 when you said making male female you said that was a special man that was a different man now that is the same man that was put into the flesh adam in genesis 2. okay now on question and answers on hebrews chapter 3 where brother branham said um one put in flesh and one was still in theophany that's right the female part which was eve that was still antiophany right now i had a bad thought of what that meant because you said before that adam and eve shared the same theophany yeah it was hard to understand i'm starting to think of conjoined twins theophany something like that but i know it wasn't true but my mind was just trying to process it itself now is this when it's separated because when i came into existence and you came into existence your theophany wasn't joined with sister peggy's right so is that the time when he took eve theophany out or when eve came out of adam was that the time when it was separated for mankind well let me make sure you follow the point all right and uh see that brother branham's when it said it you know part eve was still in theophany adam had done been put in the flesh said adam was lonely that's the quotes you know said because part of his being was not there all right now we're not talking about to the strangers that are among us we're not talking about trying to figure out soul matings and different things because that's contrary that's garbage cans even adam when they were put into flesh is when you talk about them coming to be in a soul basis you know because it would be coming down to that point see all right see then once that 126 man is the christ all right just not adam and eve okay all right you remember i went over the 126 man in 26 27 is not just adam and eve it's the christ the theophany of god eternal life because once that was put into adam then his soul was eternal all right now you're not talking about there as trying to figure out how many souls what everything is and there's no way that that peggy and i are the same soul if she has eternal life today and i don't have it that's not talking about our soul part of human beings it's talking about eternal life that was eternal life the 126 and 27 man was eternal life the christ all right not just something set aside it was the eternal life that would ever be into all of us so that way there's only one one no get the other hand out of the way but only one eternal life there's only one theophany that's eternal now all people have a theophany in the basis of a place to go to once you die because that's but it's not eternal it's not the one in cl in corinthians it says that we have one eternal in the heavens the one eternal in the heavens is not talking about mankind the earth theophany cures them down theophany simply can be used as a body of a deity or a form or whatever you are so sinners have theophany see because they got a place to live and that's their soul that they're you know in a place of hold and things whereas those that have died in christ have a place to live to go on into the presence of almighty god or go as and you know use that presence lightly go into the souls under the altar where brother branham saw the ones you know and he saw people not just the spirit or something floating around he could feel him he could hear him he could talk to him all right but see then to me when you say when brother branham is saying that adam was put in the theophany of adam in other words was put into flesh but said part of him was still missing which was eve in the theophany all right because he said that theophany was not there well see then when she was put into flesh then you can bring that theophany of her and put it in the flesh and they both had eternal life all right that's on blasphemous names because a lot of people don't know that one but read blasphemius 9 where brother ryan said especially into adam he breathed the breath of eternal life and said he became an eternal person with god well adam and eve would have been that form see so that theophany when you're thinking about theophany think about it as the same way you think about god he's one there's only one eternal theophany right so you can say well i've got a theophany up in heaven that's what 99 percent of the people of the mainstream i know of thinks about it that it's somewhere up yonder well we haven't got into that covering the scriptural part because it says if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved or were dissolved it's there the minute you die it's not there something up there that's just standing there waiting on you to get up there neither is the headstone here as something floating around up in the sky that's trying to wait for you to get to it it's terminologies it's thoughts see so part of of adam was still in theophany which would have been eve you know it's just simply stating that the body of adam then when he come forth had it been put all of the theophany into adam where would eve come from where would her eternal life have come from couldn't come from adam all right so part was left in theophany part put in flesh when it's put in flesh is genesis 2 right all right see then when the part that eve was to be the flesh removed from adam the rib you know and made a flesh then that part that was missing as we'd call it or wasn't there was put in the eve and it made eve eternal right now not in body not in spirit you're only dealing with a soul that's why brother brown says on the old book it's called um hebrews it's uh page 80 of the hebrew book i believe that's right where he says your soul is your theophany well that's what it is it's the body you go to all right i explained that a minute ago hope it's still with you a sinner he has to go to a place right if he dies he goes somewhere what goes there not his body not his spirit his soul goes to a place to wait all right so if a christian dies he goes somewhere you can call both of them theophany just remember that you're using it loosely because brother random does use the word theophany for a sinner all right but just make sure you don't use that comparison to eternal in the heavens because you can't have a sinner with that all right and see then if if you follow what i'm saying then what's that 126 and 27 that man the bible says was made male and female male and female created he him hell female create he them that wasn't a two-part man as we call too far that was the part that was to be put into adam the part that was to be put into eve and i believe being one eternal theophany that that was your creation as well as adam's creation if you have eternal life today that was your creation as well as adam's creation because it wasn't a creation it was starting something genesis 1 26 is a eternal life right when it was put into flesh then you had adam with eternal life when you receive cause we lost it that's where the fall is at see the fall will cover this evening it stopped the process had it not stopped that process look what god would have done you understand had the process not stopped then where would you and i come in that here come on if you're following me you would only have adam and eve there have been no more people because see that 126 man was you that's got eternal life not you physically and not your soul we'll get to that later it's not your soul your soul is your theophany yes but if you're born again the nature of your soul is god if not it's of the world all right you know are you following the point now yes i yes um my next question well what i think you answered it was that the term that was used to say adam and eve had the same theophany it was christ and that's the same thing with us exactly we have the same theophany which was christ which is the only one right okay see because when you receive eternal life if you followed what i just said see if you only had that that back there was just adam and eve are you with me if if that was just adam and eve you know in the 126-27 man then that's all you've ever had in the world no that was eternal life that was the same thing i spent so much time trying to say god came himself he never sent a son so when he started this creation of mankind it starts with christ so that man in 126 and 27 sister gail was you in eternal life not your body not your spirit not your soul it's the eternal life that come into your soul because see adam and eve had to be body spirit and soul then eternal life came into him all right see i tried i made an emphasis out of it i said don't make it to where that you say adam was body and spirit and then put to just put the soul of god down in there then you wouldn't you'd have christ he had to be adam had to be body spirit and soul a man then god gave him eternal life that's exactly what we are when you receive for that new birth that means your eternity caught up with you brother around said you heard from your theophany i know what the biggest portion of the people of this message believe about theophany they write songs about them they do all kind of things and i'm not going off on nobody but if you got one up yonder how are you going to get to it and all of those beyond the curtain of time were in their theophany and they were eternal i know years ago they were arguing about that that nobody had the eternal life like that and i said well brother brown said there was a 90 or 80 or 90 year old woman there that had eternal life you know she got it here and i'll i'll find it one of these days because i know it's dire but i'll quote it as my home that he said his first girlfriend was there i'll find that in this event it's a little off phrase somewhere and i can't find it even to the computer but the point is there was a lot of people there and you better remember that which one was it hope hope was there so she must have had eternal life here to get there and see i know this is strange to 90 of the people i know it is even strange here to some of you for me to talk about the soul and the things but i think it's time to rub out a little bit of our play pretties and get away from our little silly ideas about things get down to in some truth well i i always was eternal if you'll deal with me and let me and you talk on 126 and 27 that man in 126 and 27 always was eternal because he's in the image of god because he is god it's not the creation of mankind as physical beings that's the creation of christ you get any more no no i'm good you answered all the questions okay maybe somebody else who'll be next sister trudy this conversation brought up a question are you saying that because adam received eternal life eve had it when she was put into flesh how did she get eternal life okay how did he get eternal okay now there is and i said i don't mind making statements i may complain there is no quotes that i can find about eve getting eternal life when she come into the world now i'd like to have that because i've preached it for 40 years as being that she did receive eternal life in the garden the same as adam but i've preached that as a man and i've always said that's my thoughts because you can i can prove blasphemous names that brother randall says god breathed into adam's nostrils and he became an eternal person i have no argument you can't argue that one you can argue the point about eve and i would wondering why in the world some false doctrine hadn't got started on that i do i wonder i've always said a true preacher can preach false doctrine better than the false guys can do it and i don't mean that brag and i just mean it a god's honest truth if i didn't believe eve had eternal life and if i'd the only way i can do it i can't bring christ in the church together we'll bring an atom with eternal life and neve not with eternal life you can't put christ in the church together you can't have a type that's what holds me but if i was gonna preach false doctrine you know what i'd preach i'd really preach eve as a byproduct and i'd say the reason eve could fall was she wasn't eternal in soul she was just a plain old sinner made that away and then i'd make god her author and i'd be in bad shape so i don't believe it i believe even adam and theophany were one souls use that word soul in theophany close but they were not the same soul because eve was her own identity when she come into the world right me and my wife are not soul mated that's not the way you want to go it is she has eternal life i have eternal life that way we have the same eternal life and there's only one eternal life so then there's only one eternal theophany but i've always been taught it was up in heaven i know it give you the quotes from brother branham but we've also been taught that the headstone came 2000 years ago in jesus christ and that's true but it didn't come on the church because he said he was rejected and would not come until the evening time so i know my wife we talk a lot i know that i'm laying out some things that some of you have never considered or never thought about in a lot of ways but like i said folks it's time to quit playing sugar tits i've tried for almost 50 years of preaching this it's not bragging it's god's honest truth i got the tapes to prove it that's not something you're exalting yourself no i exalt jesus christ because they've been anybody that's kept this man straight it had to be him this man would love to go off on a lot of other things you think it ain't right you would too don't garbage can with me and i won't were you we talk plain and honest and i'm sorry see there cannot be but one eternal god they cannot be but one eternal soul because if 10 million people are born again that's one soul that's one theophany that's one christ there's one eternal life we all have the same eternal life that's why we're brothers and sisters in christ what a difference in flesh isn't things you know what is that that what you're talking about see then eve you still got to frown on the face so yeah all right when did he get saved when did eve receive receive eternal life all right when she was taken from adam and made into flesh then is it not correct that as he breathed into adam the nostrils and he become an eternal person at least you'd have to admit that when he was placed over god would have to breathe into her nostrils for her to have life because any of these babies anybody sitting here in front of me anybody listening the day you was born god breathed into your nostrils not satan he can't give you that he can't create he can't give your soul he perverts the nature of your soul into what you are so then when eve was removed from adam physically now what are you going to do it's like adam i can take it and prove it to you then we have because the prophet's saying it this genesis 1 26 man was put into 2 7. he said and he breathed into the nostrils of adam and he became an eternal person see then you're going to have to get with me this afternoon like because you're going to say well can you fall from eternal life you cannot fall from eternal life we'll get that before we ever start you can't fall from eternal life that'd make god an ending giver but see adam put in the flesh and god brings that life that part of him into adam as eternal life to me when eve was put in flesh god simply breathed into her nostrils the part and placed into her that part that theophany part that she was which is eternal life see that was creation but then you and i have to come by new birth to receive eternal life and you know that really the bible says that the woman that liveth in pleasure is what dead while she liveth you know really you're not a living being with a donnie until you're born again you're a human just a little higher than the dog or the monkey anyway just a little higher yeah you're a human being your soul your person right marvelous but when he breathes into your nostrils the breath of eternal life by the new birth you then become an eternal person with god like adam was in the garden the only difference is the adoptions and the things that you've got to go through so eve received eternal life by god breathing into her nostrils but then once you bring sin you got to cut it off now you just look at the fact if there hadn't been no sin look what happened let's get it look what will happen do you realize now we're not going to get into a long process to prove a point but talk about it what if sin had not entered the picture i said it while ago and at least he was amen and some agreeing about it anyway you said it would have been only his offspring it would have come into existence all right how are you going to get them here and we're not going to get into perverted ideas but you know that adam could not have gotten us here that's why sisters come on i've fought this thing out for 50 years i'm not no feminist or what you call them ago words you know oh you're this there you know but i've defended the gospel for 50 years your women are not no different than us men are you need the baptism of the holy ghost and we need it too no matter who you are what you think about it what would have happened had we not fallen you realize that eve adam could have nudged eve and said eve it's time to speak he needed eve for the speaking come on 40 years so you want to argue with me just keep on hurricane eve would have spoke the word and a baby would have come not newborn a child would have been standing there wouldn't there had to be no baby to grow up and be old he would have simply spoke let's sprang down the line he would simply spoke saith that's right abel let's put it back up evil said abel come forth now if you think i'm wrong let's get in some bible because according to my understanding of reading the scriptures that there was a tree in the garden we know there was two trees right we know that okay but there was a tree there of the tree of life in the garden right do you realize that it's a beautiful story that eve would have said abel come forth and there he stood but you know what he would have been even though god gave him and breathed into his nostrils eternal life he would have still been mortal in his body because adam and eve were still mortal in their body you know doomed to death which wouldn't have been no death do you know what abel would have had to done abel would have had to walk over to the tree of life and taken a leaf off the tree or a beat by the fruit and his body would have been made eternal because that was what would happen to adam and eve they would partook of the tree of life and their body would have been made eternal that's where they needed eternity from right seth came next noah bring it all the way down but you see that was not the plan and purpose because you'd have trouble because you'd run into christ one day that he would need to come forth and he didn't do it so we did that's beside the point we didn't come that away ends the story right it just shows a beautiful picture because really listen the reason i believe it that way brother louise you're born body spirit and soul lost amen now you may believe something mother but i might need to move over to somebody else because he's been back in some backgrounds and i don't think he does but i use my hollywood okay okay now brother colley your body spirit and soul but you need eternal life amen you know what god gave you eternal life by the new birth it makes your soul eternal that don't make your spirit eternal that don't make your body eternal but as long as you eat of this which is the tree of life the word of god the bible one day your body will be made eternal some way we may ought to die and go by the ground except maybe one person but somebody's still going to stand there and be changed and that'll take care of it all right eternal life so we're coming the same way we would have come except sin entered the picture right we're to come to the tree of life which is the word of god this message is the tree of life which is the word of god and we're eating of that tree see then there's no problems with the the fall is not a bad thing right as i said it just helps him to manifest his attributes because if it's going to come that way he's going to be savior healer delivered he's going to come that way but the ultimate end is one thing had there been no sin there would have been one way but with sin the ultimate end is the same is the bride of jesus christ with eternal life but then just think about it you know that there's eight times more if you type in it foolish virgins than our genuine bride if you top no one right in enoch well you know those people can be given eternal life but they'll never be the bride that's why they'll always be somebody for you to talk to about christ that answer your question or talk long enough i have another one all right go ahead when brother branham said in the beginning before the eternal could this mean that before the word came forth because the word is eternal yeah because you could be saying in the beginning before the eternal before he moved over into the or developed into the form to say let there be and then you'll start time on the basis of not time 24 hours a day you started a element because you're still back in eternity that's why john 1 1 is not over in genesis 1. that's where we always put it we're going to put john 1 1 in the beginning was the word word with god in the word was god we're going to put that over in genesis 1 where it said and god made the heavens and the earth that's okay that's in the beginning but going back in the beginning before the eternal back up into heaven with it and let him stand our as the word let him stand there as the word that can speak let that word let him speak his thought there's in the beginning was the word all the way back in eternity you have the word beginning now see then that's the way brother around uses it because through this message i brought these things out you know anything else all right who'll be next we've got about 20 minutes who's the next brother dean he would have finally had the child yeah now how she had that's you covered it for diamonds right i can't see her and adam before the fall had in producing christ i believe this is the only way that it could be and as far as uh receiving uh uh even receiving the holy ghost i like to call her a woman called when she come forth from adam she was still a woman and uh just like pentecost he separated himself 120 times and come in he had to give evil when she come forth from the flesh he don't only give her a soul but he'd give her a spirit and give her eternal life just like he gave him eternal life at pentecost so i mean it's pretty simple to me you know of course if it's revealed to you it is simple right but uh but that's what brother brown said he said she would have finally had the child exactly but i believe it let me put this in there while somebody who's next and he put this in there you know that god can speak the word but that ain't the way he wants it you know what he wants you to say let me quote a random moses got the thought he said it ain't word yet he says then the thought comes from god to moses moses got the thought he said then he went out and spoke it said then it become the word see god wants you to speak the word that's the whole thing but that's what people see they get that well brother branham was the only one to speak the word show me that in the bible and she'll read that in the prophet's message no we won't be like him we're not trying to be like him he'll tell you what i don't even want the thing the ministry i've got let alone what he had and that's as honest as i can be i could go home at night and lay down and go to sleep i wouldn't have to put on no sleep acne machine to get if i didn't have to preach you don't have to brother they'll know sir but somebody's got to do it so i'll do my part all right but do you understand who's next who be next any more questions because i don't mind going this afternoon with them because i love them i was going to add more to what brother dean said really there's no reason he couldn't have given eve eternal life because there was no sin he wants to give eternal life to everybody exactly he can't when we're naturally born in this world because of sin we're born and sin and shaped in iniquity so he has to you know bring us through his salvation redemption plan right can i ask you a question too about that logos go ahead i made the comment in the sunday school class a while back and uh i should have checked with you first before i announce it to the before i mentioned it to the class but what i'd said was that god deals with us through language and that from that logos as part of that because that's the word form of god there had to be language brought forth there too exactly because if we didn't have language we couldn't receive god faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word we listen to the tapes we listen we read the books we uh talk with each other about the word and through that we receive christ so where will we be with that language right and when he confounded the language at babel you know he might he specifically said jesus said the great commission go into all the world and to preach to every nation because they weren't one speech anymore right so that was a language barrier exactly so he made sure to say bring it to every nation and that's our commission even to the creature she said to every creature so anyway that's all i was going to say do you know that how many let's let's give a number let's say there's 10 000 different languages in the world this is a number okay you know that's logos you understand what i just said that's logos because he can speak in any language remember on the day of pentecost it was one man speaking in one language it wasn't a denominational idea that there's 120 interpreters you know that's what they think it won't work because the bible said out here we every man in our own tongue we're in we are born brother branham one day he's talking to something with a girl and and the girl through the interpreter said i thought he didn't understand i thought he could something he spoke the language he spoke in english it was interpreted one way or the other it went right straight to the other language that's the logos that's the speech all languages are speech communication speech is what an ability to communicate and that's what we do whether it be or whatever you know it's like i always say we go up north and that's southern folks we tell them say what do you want to eat with some maters and taters and they'll laugh at you all the way in the back you know and they'll get in there and joke about you but they'll bring you some maters and taters you come south and you get those northern people and they say i want some tomatoes and potatoes and they'll say what'd you say language is a communication gap you just think god can understand every language in the world that's wonderful anybody else will i'd like to say something about you talk about beyond the curtain of time uh and i was i've been thinking a lot about this uh when uh david nunez passed away here to show a while back i got to think about it one time one day i said well he's there beyond the curtain of time because i believe that yeah but when you when you die you give up the ghosts and on this side right here and you go there you enter into another position that that though nothing have to be added to you that you can come and pick up this body you come you can have come back into your thinking what you bypass when you come into the world exactly you're right back that's why sharon rose know their daddy and everything right that's why our sister sister hope was there and different ones you know and they said when brother brown said there uh uh will paul group make it it says yes i preach this is exactly what paul says they all screamed out exactly we were arrested on that exactly so so that takes the fear out of anybody that really has an idea if you have to go by the ground if you leave your time out and you have to go by the ground and you enter into that your theory goes into that place you're all you're waiting on is just the rest of us to get right and and and bring you out of there because nothing else got to be added to you you'll come and pick his body up in a glorified state and together with us we can go into his presence here because we've got glorified bodies right because that's the same thing statue of perfect man you're born again right here at faith is that holy spirit here that even the faith of the father is put right here with holy spirit is that any more holy spirit than this or a different no is that love a different one no it's what you're manifesting what it is so is it with your soul being your theophany it's eternal life that's the only way it can be there in here is this be eternal and that be eternal and there's no such thing as two eternities it's one man let's stand we we won't sing nothing with us we'll think of a verse or something anybody has a need for prayer then come ahead we won't do the musicians because it's tyndale all right anybody else just just wait brother we don't have no music i love you anybody have a need i love you because he's got to go for some blood work tomorrow let it all be all right we seen you do it and keep it and line it up in the way and lord for all the requests that he made lord we love you and we thank you and be with each one father that our brothers asked for in jesus name amen lord jesus you heard her brother just a simple statement that you have your way in his life what else could we want lord and your desires to be fulfilled in us you said that if we desire that then you will make a way so you make a way in our brother's life lord that you can take over and you can lead him into what he's doing and the things and the job and the different things lord you just work it all out for your honor and glory in jesus name anybody else just my son brother mark's having a lot of trouble with his back if you've ever had back trouble then just remember it all right lord jesus we lay hands upon our brother believe in you father there's a lot of people in here that we've had back trouble still have back troubles and things it's hindering us so it makes us think it makes us be more compassionate with our brother about his hurting in his back and we just ask you father to be the one that we spoke about as being a healer your attribute of healing now can be made manifest because of the hurting in the back so we condemn this problem in his back in the name of jesus christ amen amen anybody else remember he wants you to speak he wants you to say why don't you believe it and just say well lord we've listened there the other day we're brought around told somebody said just go start thanking him about it and then somebody come here and preach on it you know when the service services start thinking about it he can make it manifest if we speak it wednesday night brother dean brought the fact about that i was having some back i pulled something in my back that was no sunday night sunday well monday morning when i woke up i had no pain and you know usually after you get over a backache every once in a while you'll have it 20. it was like it was never there thank you and i just thank the church amen just remember the service this afternoon father we thank you lord for your grace and your love unto us we pray that what we said this morning to try to answer people and we know that in doing we're talking as human mortals that we create more questions but we know that there's a god that can answer all of our desires and our thoughts so you just open it up to us lord you give us the understanding of what we have need of we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you're dismissed me
