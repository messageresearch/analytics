[5:06] 19 as I said if we can get to it we will

[5:15] questions and answers maybe not to
[5:17] finish it but to make sure you're
[5:19] understanding up to the point of where
[5:21] we were speaking from okay all right
[5:24] Matthew 19 verse 9 the fresh is also
[5:29] coming to him taking him and saying unto
[5:31] Him is it lawful for a man to put away
[5:32] his wife forever calls and he answered
[5:35] and said unto them have you not read
[5:37] that he was made them at the beginning
[5:39] made them male and female and said for
[5:42] this cause shall a man leave his father
[5:43] and mother and shall cleave to his wife
[5:46] and they twain shall be one flesh before
[5:49] they are no more Twain but one flesh but
[5:52] God therefore hath joined together let
[5:53] not man put asunder they say unto him
[5:57] why did Moses in command to give a
[5:59] writing of divorcement and to put her
[6:02] away he said unto them Moses because of
[6:05] the hardness of your heart suffered you
[6:07] to put away your wife but from the
[6:10] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[6:13] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[6:15] except it be for fornication and shall
[6:18] marry another committeth adultery and
[6:21] this will marry her which is put away
[6:22] does commit adultery you may be seated
[6:26] whoever that is blessing to the reading
[6:29] of the word now this is um I guess
[6:36] message number eight so there's no
[6:38] michelly on our series that we've been
[6:41] in and this you know write down your
[6:43] thoughts in other words
[6:45] you say well I can't put in words a
[6:47] question you know I can't get it to a
[6:50] question well write it down just in a
[6:54] dollar a point or say them well you know
[6:57] what about because we were doing last
[6:58] night in them and we really had a
[7:00] wonderful time in in the Bible study
[7:02] last not talking about the officers of
[7:04] the church and we really had a better
[7:07] participation when then we've ever had
[7:09] now I mean we had a whole lot more
[7:11] questions and answers and a lot more
[7:14] discussions and hugs like that and we're
[7:16] still not through the officer we got
[7:18] them to the deacon you got to Pastor
[7:21] sister pastor and the trustees and then
[7:23] down to the Deacons but you know we'll
[7:25] we're taking it up the next time and
[7:27] there's continued home but we really had
[7:29] a good time I appreciate that for people
[7:32] opening up and talking and
[7:34] fellowshipping around the things you
[7:37] know of what they they can see and do
[7:40] and and on like that so if we appreciate
[7:43] it men this made sure the next time
[7:46] you're like our weekend then do okay now
[7:49] we've been in what is gonna sail that we
[7:52] were you know the point of the question
[7:54] was you know this that's an old saying
[7:58] is uh I've got a sister's got a question
[8:02] yeah you know we're brothers got a
[8:04] question with general with is your
[8:06] question you know but it's a point of
[8:09] asking it you know and you're
[8:11] embarrassed to ask it so you ask you in
[8:15] the basis of that way you know to get it
[8:20] to go and that's okay write it down we
[8:22] got a sister that needs this answer we
[8:24] have an agreement and write it down in
[8:26] the comment I'll show this afternoon we
[8:29] will be having Ravi and Ruth wants to
[8:32] how their wedding vows renewed so they
[8:34] will be doing that this afternoon and if
[8:37] Sony you wants to join with them that
[8:39] would be fine we do this every once in a
[8:41] while but we chose to do it just after
[8:43] noon on more than you know this morning
[8:46] go to the time wise so on so let's just
[8:49] do it that way all right now we have
[8:52] been covering this whole marriage and
[8:55] divorce and trying to you know get to a
[9:01] place to understand and see what we need
[9:05] to understand for our day an hour about
[9:07] it and so we found out that what is a
[9:10] marriage it's when you ask the girl to
[9:13] marry you and shoot satisfied now if you
[9:16] asked her and she doesn't accept it it's
[9:18] not a marriage the we've met all the
[9:21] points trying to make it clear along the
[9:24] way to keep it in the right order all
[9:27] right so then what is a marriage is when
[9:29] you're making your bowels not because
[9:31] you're standing here at the altar or
[9:32] whatever making the vowels are you know
[9:35] but when you ask the girl to marry you
[9:38] and she accepts then that is a wedding
[9:41] in red a random we covered it that is an
[9:43] engagement and he said if you're engaged
[9:46] as far as God is concerned in you're
[9:47] married whether you live together as
[9:50] husband and wife or whatever you do or
[9:52] whether you had the vows at the altar
[9:54] those are things that just consummated
[9:58] or what the word is finishing up the
[10:00] things that you started with your
[10:02] commitment our vowed to one another all
[10:05] right then in trying to make a simple
[10:07] understanding of what is root of or I
[10:09] put these on every time because somebody
[10:12] come along and pick it up and they may
[10:14] hear it and they say well you know what
[10:16] are these things
[10:17] well at least maybe the interest enough
[10:19] to go backward listen what is a divorce
[10:21] it's simply to reversal vows I mean you
[10:25] may go through the courts you may go
[10:27] through the paperwork you may have to
[10:28] have a trial usually have a palliative
[10:30] vision of properties you may have to
[10:33] have all kinds of things and setting up
[10:35] um alimonies in and all kind of thing
[10:38] but the simple point is what you're
[10:43] taking back those vows you made your
[10:49] just simply taking away feud in another
[10:51] country you might know how the court you
[10:53] might not have the all the time but you
[10:56] would do according to their love and
[10:57] maybe you'd go to fornicating of a drive
[11:00] and you say I don't want to be married
[11:02] to this man anymore do you want to be
[11:04] known whatever would be and then it
[11:06] would be a divorce because it would be a
[11:09] separation of those violent are now we
[11:13] went through and covered that we read
[11:15] here in Matthew 19 3 where that they
[11:18] come tempting Jesus to ask them a
[11:21] question about it and said can a man put
[11:23] a walk this way for every calls so we
[11:26] covered that to the point that they were
[11:29] not trying to get a good answer they
[11:31] were wanting to kick him and trying to
[11:33] trap him but he answered them and said
[11:35] it wasn't soap and begin so it in the
[11:37] beginning there's just one man one woman
[11:39] that wasn't messed up in all the ways
[11:41] and and wet in the Prophet said and
[11:44] Daniel 70 weeks that polygamy is wrong
[11:46] today you know and stuff like that so we
[11:49] don't go into those points if that
[11:51] changed it calgary when Jesus Christ
[11:53] paid the price now it's one man one
[11:56] woman it's not one man in five women
[11:58] it's see that doesn't work out you gotta
[12:00] have booked get something straight so we
[12:03] thank god for the grace of marriage and
[12:05] divorce that he has given unto us to
[12:08] where we can straighten up a lot of
[12:09] situation that all right but my point
[12:12] has been this if you don't know you need
[12:14] the grace you will never ask for
[12:18] well guarded they did God doesn't do
[12:21] things like this to blanket well you
[12:23] just get everything when you hear that
[12:24] you like the song doesn't know if you
[12:28] don't need you know you need it you
[12:30] might not never asked for it that way
[12:33] uh-huh then maybe it's a job like me or
[12:36] sometimes being just you know get into
[12:40] work and see what it says all right
[12:43] nothing says it that's where we gotta
[12:46] stand I didn't believe it that way all
[12:48] right now we've gotten to that that Eve
[12:51] was created perfect and that they would
[12:54] only one male in one female in any
[12:56] species back there and then when you
[12:59] come into the fall you know it was
[13:02] messed up by Eve committing adultery
[13:04] right now we're going to get down to
[13:06] this after a while if i have x naught
[13:08] this afternoon curtsy in the message
[13:11] people are easily to read and use things
[13:15] and they'll say well you put away your
[13:18] wife or fornication but then they say
[13:20] you can't put her away from adultery now
[13:23] we're going to get through that in a
[13:24] minute and see that somebody's
[13:25] narrow-minded some work and miss the
[13:28] point i think of the truth of it go back
[13:31] you know we know what has happened and
[13:35] who can get to do it you know do it but
[13:37] you said well if she wasn't her and a
[13:40] half of whom had not lived together they
[13:43] didn't do this that the other so it
[13:45] would have been fornication you know
[13:48] because fornication is technically a
[13:50] word used for a girl that has something
[13:54] wrong before she marries to a man all
[13:57] right is that the way the Prophet
[13:58] described it adultery is technically a
[14:01] form of saying after you married all
[14:05] right you know in something takes place
[14:07] all right we'll get back to these in the
[14:09] minute and and review but you say well
[14:11] now what was it with evil art now that's
[14:13] what I've been trying to anchor in you
[14:16] that when you ask the girl to marry you
[14:20] and she excels
[14:22] is a merry now I don't care who it is
[14:26] and run around with sailor who who it
[14:28] was he didn't burn on hold he and all
[14:32] like that he said Billy Paul was married
[14:34] and you would not do the way all right
[14:36] because he simply they were in you know
[14:38] that they had went through that all
[14:40] right now but Eve committed the prophet
[14:44] said adultery right wait the Prophet to
[14:49] give the definition I'm just quoting
[14:51] these though we will bring these up with
[14:53] one try to bypass but quoting it from
[14:55] paragraph 2 29 of invisible union that
[14:59] said Eve who committed adultery all
[15:03] right now as she committed adultery see
[15:08] you didn't say she just committed
[15:09] fornication she committed adultery right
[15:15] why because of the fact that she was
[15:19] married to Adam all right now in Genesis
[15:23] 2 and 23 adam said this is flesh of my
[15:27] flesh and bone of my bone we are one
[15:32] right all right so then he was
[15:36] signifying or the Bible was that they
[15:38] were one in marriage cuz they were one
[15:41] in body right you know and then
[15:44] separated in magnitude new park all
[15:46] right in Genesis 1 28 they were already
[15:48] cold and we know this is the spiritual
[15:51] book that when he'll need food but
[15:52] they're already told to multiply and
[15:54] replenish the earth so Adam and Eve was
[15:56] married me so then it would have been
[15:59] adultery they put the prophets right
[16:03] when he said on the invisible union
[16:05] there right after 29 f it he committed
[16:09] adultery already set it on paragraph 57
[16:11] of marriage and divorce that she
[16:14] committed adultery right all right see
[16:17] then that way we said well I don't care
[16:19] I've got my foot definition look all
[16:21] right keep your definition and see what
[16:23] walk to I like what one brother said he
[16:26] said he had his marriage and divorce
[16:29] book and then he laid it down and he
[16:31] wrote a bunch of questions I said I wish
[16:33] that man would hear where I could ask
[16:35] you these questions and now he said it
[16:38] dropped quoting him he said the Lord
[16:40] spoke to them and said are you going to
[16:42] believe my profit or what you think now
[16:46] you made that statement from the pulpit
[16:48] you I know that's the way I stand right
[16:52] are we going to believe what we used to
[16:53] believe or are we going to believe the
[16:55] prophets less you happy which way is it
[16:58] see and then I've always been quick to
[17:01] say that we maybe don't want to believe
[17:03] exactly the wording here but when it
[17:06] comes that we need the grace oh we're
[17:08] glad you know we're glad to do that it's
[17:13] like I'm telling the other day it's not
[17:15] making a lot of nobody but you know I
[17:17] get in trouble cuz i go around call for
[17:19] people and didn't have another Donnie's
[17:20] of the day said something to the guy
[17:22] that works are about you know Hispanics
[17:25] Mexicans or whatever you have no real
[17:28] quick and he went the Mexican well you
[17:31] know what I thought about that I'm not
[17:33] disgrace nope how about ever race you
[17:36] say well I'm not a mexican who we just
[17:39] used to call it mexican and we will use
[17:42] to call him black other times you know
[17:44] come that witness the languages we were
[17:46] using and it wouldn't rather cover it
[17:48] with just what was used to do it but i
[17:50] can tell you one time you could go to
[17:52] Brazil less portuguese switches Park
[17:55] Spanish you could go anywhere in to the
[17:58] islands revenge wireless and the things
[18:00] that would be the spanish-speaking
[18:01] people if you're saying and you say that
[18:04] if any of y'all Mexicans makes a no so
[18:07] we'll well I I've got a million dollars
[18:10] I don't want to give to ever
[18:13] spanish-speaking people that will admit
[18:15] your Mexicans I bet they'd be a lot of
[18:18] change in Mexican
[18:19] I mean what you done I like when you I
[18:22] said no I wouldn't change my country but
[18:24] you know what to say all right I'm just
[18:26] not making no joke or nobody it's just
[18:29] getting down to the fact that we used to
[18:33] have our ideas and we're settling our
[18:35] ideas right I am what well I'm not to
[18:40] why yeah I mean you want to go find more
[18:45] to England someone found some blonde
[18:47] races where they you know they're real
[18:49] wat you cannot have always said you
[18:51] whether you like it or not the black
[18:53] people can find their roots we're a
[18:56] Caucasian which means we're a concoction
[18:58] we're a mixed breed of a whole lot of
[19:01] things that brought it down to arrest
[19:02] nobody can't brag about we are all right
[19:06] till then the profit when he's dealing
[19:08] with things it's his message not mine of
[19:11] yours in my whole point all right then
[19:14] set it up to the bases the work is what
[19:17] the Prophet said and it's not what me
[19:19] and you think right Matt it's not the
[19:22] idea what I think it ought to be this
[19:23] way with it I rested that's what
[19:26] happened in the garden right the deeds
[19:28] that I think then he said that caused
[19:30] all this problem all right so we lay it
[19:33] on what the Prophet had to say all right
[19:35] we went through own questions and
[19:37] answers 1959 628 paragraph 185 the worth
[19:45] it brought around describes whether or
[19:47] not he said adultery and fornication he
[19:50] said the words are can be the same he
[19:53] said I know that fornication literally
[19:56] means a girl before she's married that's
[19:59] fornication uncleanness he said an
[20:01] adultery means people that are married
[20:04] but it's he said it's the same so now
[20:07] when we get down in a few minutes to it
[20:09] I'm going to river revert back to that
[20:11] and see if you still believe it because
[20:14] you know of where we're trying to make
[20:17] the sand in the last days then and be
[20:19] able to understand all right now we had
[20:24] let's start on three a joke before we or
[20:29] before we do the other one let's start
[20:31] on three hey first we was going to go
[20:33] over to the next and I I messed him up
[20:35] but we'll go over to 3a because we were
[20:37] quoting the others and we want to go to
[20:39] 3a and just I just put that number in
[20:42] that word with it coming right now watch
[20:47] he's talking about that she has got a
[20:50] living husband till no man can marry her
[20:54] care what she does and who she is she's
[20:57] got a living husband there is no grounds
[21:00] for her at all now that's the point but
[21:04] it's not for him causes her when we get
[21:06] to that in a minute not him the you got
[21:09] to make the word run into continuity it
[21:11] stated against him it's not stated to
[21:14] get him to remarry but it stated against
[21:16] her but is no grounds for a woman to
[21:18] divorce her husband and remarry right
[21:21] amen there is no scriptural grounds and
[21:23] nothing in the prophets mentioned for
[21:25] that to be done I by the coast it's that
[21:29] the cursor which are the same curse that
[21:31] was brought on the fact of what the one
[21:33] done in the beginning because she
[21:36] committed adultery the brain for the the
[21:41] beastly knees using the things you know
[21:43] and all of that coming through so then
[21:45] that's what we should stay on that point
[21:47] to see all right for now I gave you a
[21:50] bunch of definitions like I did the
[21:52] other day and then I want you to use
[21:55] these definitions but what I want you to
[21:57] think about there's a man have a right
[22:01] to put his life away for just any
[22:03] college I want to keep reviewing that in
[22:09] other words can't he just come up and
[22:10] say I want to do this I want to do that
[22:13] well that's what they had done in the
[22:15] Bible times and that's what Jesus ran
[22:17] into and he said because of the hardness
[22:19] of your hearts you wanted this way and
[22:23] you got it but you got it in your way
[22:26] all right and they had it that you could
[22:29] just put them away for about it
[22:30] huh but we went through to prove that
[22:33] even like if the man was to put away his
[22:35] wife he had to have the ground the proof
[22:39] son um wrong thing all right before he
[22:44] could put her away and marry again
[22:46] because it would not you know not be
[22:49] scriptural so we gave that now we want
[22:51] to do diff this straight other
[22:53] scriptures or go ahead pull up Matthew
[22:55] 19 we will get this right straight on
[22:59] the point to see what grounds does a man
[23:03] half woman has no grounds to divorce her
[23:06] husband now that's what your prophet
[23:07] said so if you don't agree with it
[23:09] that's your business but you just
[23:12] understand it what I preach here is what
[23:15] I believe and we stood on that and I
[23:17] stood on this for 40-something years
[23:19] right worried about this not the first
[23:20] time I've done this I do it about every
[23:22] four or five years because of the new
[23:24] growth and the people coming along all
[23:27] right now I want you to listen to the
[23:29] scripture you say well i can put away
[23:33] when I wife for this I put away for that
[23:36] now I want to know and when I'm going to
[23:38] get on it this morning all right but why
[23:42] would a profit say that you can put your
[23:44] wife away for cutting to her
[23:49] that don't know that kind of sounds like
[23:51] it's just about any calls but you gotta
[23:55] remember he said you cannot remarry that
[24:00] front amen just because you put your
[24:03] wife away for cutting iron and i'll give
[24:05] you one where he said why would you want
[24:07] to do it huh so we get back on that this
[24:11] afternoon but i'm just saying it because
[24:13] i like for to do that click click you
[24:15] mind because you you get a mindset and
[24:18] you just know but it's not for just any
[24:23] college there's got to be a scriptural
[24:25] column now if cutting the higher doesn't
[24:28] power these scriptures run here then
[24:31] we'll get through this afternoon then
[24:33] you're making it to be that you just do
[24:35] it for any college you're making bread
[24:37] around them to just do it for any
[24:39] college but it's got the tide of this
[24:41] scripture why keep reading Matthew not
[24:44] think alright so now let's read the
[24:47] scripture and see what it says and then
[24:50] the definition Matthew 19 and 9 and I
[24:53] say unto you whosoever shall put away
[24:55] his wife except it be for fornication
[25:01] and shall marry another committeth
[25:04] adultery whosoever marrieth her which is
[25:06] put away does commit adultery now why
[25:11] would Jesus put that word except in
[25:14] there in other words except would be the
[25:17] only reason are you reading the
[25:21] scripture can we read it this away and I
[25:24] say unto you whosoever shall put away
[25:26] his wife has to have a reason to do it
[25:33] and the only reason all right is
[25:39] connected to fornication
[25:45] now cause you burn the bread i read we
[25:48] gave the quotes and the Prophet work he
[25:50] said if I run out and didn't do
[25:51] everything didn't take care of the
[25:53] family didn't feed him he said she can't
[25:55] divorce Lee marry again she called she
[25:57] don't do right she pen Hank divorce her
[26:00] no and when he got down to the point of
[26:05] the hires we'll get through this
[26:06] afternoon he said you can put away your
[26:07] wife for cutting her heart and honored
[26:10] of God to do so but he said you cannot
[26:11] remarry for that call cause you're the
[26:15] only cop right the only called any man
[26:20] has and can ever come up with is for the
[26:23] two scriptures that we're going to use
[26:24] and you will see that accept and saving
[26:27] is the same word all right so if a man
[26:30] puts away his wife for any other reason
[26:34] then it be connected to fornication do
[26:41] you know that's why you're going to have
[26:42] to unlock those doubts in your mind of
[26:45] fornication adultery but I know they've
[26:51] done it I can call a name of one brother
[26:53] they tried to divorce the brother are
[26:56] the preacher said he's got to go back
[26:58] and live with that warming how she wants
[27:00] to said no no
[27:07] so you can do that if for some reason I
[27:11] got into it hand this is my already very
[27:13] young ministry and I still believed it
[27:17] could I can read the Bible huh now so
[27:23] then what does the word except me hey
[27:27] it's the Greek word 1508 means except it
[27:32] means our cyber safe we'll get to that
[27:33] Matthew on the other all right now sit
[27:37] if not not translated miscellaneous can
[27:42] do if not accept but all right so what
[27:48] is the word except me the only reason
[27:54] you can't put her away but only for
[27:58] fornication right hon and then marry
[28:04] again
[28:06] yeah the cops run around safe an
[28:10] unbeliever leaves no go ahead we went
[28:13] through that when I go ahead with the
[28:15] next one which is Matthew 532 but I say
[28:19] unto you that whosoever shall put away
[28:21] his wife saving for the cause of
[28:23] fornication causing her to commit
[28:26] adultery and she was remember that North
[28:27] committed adultery now saving what is
[28:31] the definition of saving 3224 the Greek
[28:35] Mexican means saving it means except are
[28:40] to be without except without exception
[28:43] herbicides so there's no grounds for the
[28:47] man except it be connected to
[28:50] fornication to be able to put away his
[28:54] wife and marry again now we will get
[29:00] down and drop down to the lower levels
[29:02] of thoughts in doing so now let's go
[29:04] ahead and deal what's the definition for
[29:06] fornication except it be for fornication
[29:12] alright what is the definition of
[29:14] fornication illicit sexual intercourse
[29:21] he goes into taking corinthians back
[29:24] into bringing it to a virtual even part
[29:26] of it will totally together and i don't
[29:29] know how do you do that met form
[29:31] excellent the worship of idols see
[29:33] fornication leads down to the works of
[29:35] revivals that's fornication israel
[29:40] committed fornication by running after
[29:41] the idols of the people around them all
[29:44] right now so the fornication is a little
[29:47] isset sexual intercourse more negation
[29:52] all right now what is it adultery while
[29:55] we getting these words out of way
[29:56] adultery comes from the word 32-29 which
[30:00] is commit adultery all right to have
[30:03] unlawful intercourse with another's wife
[30:06] to commit adultery with actual adultery
[30:10] applies to be in a marriage
[30:15] or what somebody else's wife that's why
[30:18] the Prophet been when Adam and Eve were
[30:20] married and she had relations with the
[30:22] Beast the Beast was committing adultery
[30:25] with Adams wife huh no that would be
[30:29] called adultery you wouldn't have to
[30:31] worry about it coming from any other
[30:33] form our language now it would be that
[30:38] they see then there's no grounds for her
[30:42] the only grounds for him but around said
[30:46] there's two thoughts he said one thought
[30:50] is a man can put away his wife really
[30:52] cause said the other side says when we
[30:56] can put where her husband he said you go
[30:57] either way and you've missed it he said
[31:03] you've got to come back to the middle
[31:04] this is for marriage and divorce that I
[31:06] ask you to read and those will you need
[31:08] come back to the middle the work you
[31:13] think you can see the truth about his
[31:15] heart now look what he says the frame
[31:17] this one up for the job creator would
[31:19] start from that point never really a
[31:22] machine this is taken for marriage and
[31:24] divorce paragraph 227 which is 65 on to
[31:28] 21 and she's got a living husband so no
[31:32] man can marry care what she does you
[31:36] know she is she's got a living hood
[31:38] there's no grounds for her at all but
[31:41] it's not for hyung call to her not him
[31:44] get it you have to make the word running
[31:47] continuity said nothing said he couldn't
[31:51] but she came because his her not him
[31:55] that's exactly what the Bible says
[31:57] causes her it's not stated against him
[32:00] to remarry but her want Christ in the
[32:04] top notice it is stated that he can not
[32:07] remarry only a virgin that he goes in
[32:09] and explains that the the
[32:11] things about all right now remember what
[32:16] I'm saying the only grounds that a man
[32:18] has to put away his wife and marry again
[32:23] here's the fact of fornication adultery
[32:27] all right now in doing that then I want
[32:34] to stake this and then this will go
[32:35] through it I want you to think about
[32:39] something brother Anderson pull back up
[32:44] 19-9 because i want you to see this
[32:49] don't you just read it for
[32:55] yourself now watch what it says and I
[33:00] say unto you whosoever shall put away
[33:01] his wife executive be for fornication
[33:03] and she'll marry another committeth
[33:07] adultery if he puts away his wife
[33:13] accepted me for fornication is that
[33:16] money and math another he commits
[33:20] adultery why Cody got to live in why I
[33:25] centrum we're not in polygamous when I
[33:29] didn't do those things you know if one
[33:32] man one woman nice have it honey listen
[33:35] and whosoever marry her which is put
[33:39] away does commit adultery honey so if
[33:44] you put away your wife or any other
[33:46] reason than the fact that it was
[33:47] adultery or fornication and you Marion
[33:56] you're living in adultery sensible
[34:04] enough now what I say is that sometimes
[34:07] people get locked in and they'll hear
[34:08] the rest of what I say remember there is
[34:10] a grace that goes with this but where we
[34:13] don't missed apply for any little tiny
[34:15] back right and it's not for 49 different
[34:18] reasons I'm let's do that okay all right
[34:20] so let's get a point if we see for
[34:27] definitely the fact that city if he puts
[34:30] her away for any other cause and he
[34:32] marries now and then he's commitment no
[34:39] tree
[34:44] alright
[34:46] but now we'll get down with quotes from
[34:48] the profit if you put her away for
[34:52] fornication you know you can remarry you
[34:58] have a committed adultery you're not
[35:02] living in adultery she's a lot of people
[35:04] are free and don't really know it right
[35:06] they never had the situation so they
[35:09] don't think about all right you know
[35:13] that run around and said they were never
[35:16] married in the beginning because she
[35:18] made the wrong if you withheld the truth
[35:23] in other ways and said they were never
[35:26] married in the beginning all right now
[35:30] that's the truth of what we're getting
[35:32] good but won't you think about it you
[35:37] put away your wife or any other reason
[35:39] than for negation another reason than an
[35:41] adulterous act and you remarry urine der
[35:45] unadulterated everybody clear all right
[35:48] now we can get over any other scripture
[35:51] that said if he puts her away he calls
[35:53] us her right to commit adultery now why
[36:02] would it say he calls his her that is
[36:06] bringing back to something he's doing
[36:08] wrong
[36:14] are you listening they push her away for
[36:19] the reason of fornication or adultery
[36:20] not use the word either way coach never
[36:22] change with a million we will get to
[36:24] that in a second but I believe that a
[36:27] man has a right to put away his wife
[36:29] wife married wife and she goes out
[36:33] commits adultery against him he has a
[36:35] right to put her away and marry him i
[36:39] said i don't like some statements more
[36:41] into this series and i have in a lot of
[36:44] other forms or maybe being more stern
[36:46] and then let people out there decide
[36:49] what they want to believe because how
[36:51] you gonna talk together but around and
[36:53] said that Jesus put away the Jehovah the
[36:56] job will put away his rod Jesus put away
[36:58] his bride he said he proved it in the
[37:01] days of Luther whistling Pentecost and
[37:02] he put him away married again I know
[37:06] brother told me four years ago he said
[37:10] we don't want no types in shannon's see
[37:15] because he knew his traffic types and
[37:17] shadows that's reason you didn't want
[37:20] you understand what I'm saying he said
[37:23] he didn't want no types and shadows as
[37:24] Christ in the church well why wouldn't
[37:27] you want because you're afraid of them
[37:30] because they disapprove your doctoring
[37:31] life all right now but getting to the
[37:36] point what happens if you put her away
[37:39] for any other reason than fornication
[37:43] you caused her to commit it up right
[37:51] you put her away for any other rigs in
[37:54] the fornication adultery and I'll act of
[37:58] marriage you called her to commit
[38:06] adultery run around and said what if you
[38:08] want the quote said she will marry my
[38:12] work she's going how am I am but you
[38:16] caused it now like I said the other day
[38:22] about the guy you know that said if you
[38:25] put away your wife you know you can't do
[38:26] this at the other but if she's dead he
[38:29] said we didn't eat this type of gonna
[38:30] shoot you know like the woman she could
[38:32] just shoot her husband well he's no
[38:34] longer a lot known to which she's
[38:37] remarried according to Romans 7 her
[38:39] husband's got to be David but that make
[38:43] her a murderer so which one you want to
[38:44] face God with adultery murder according
[38:47] to the Bible neither one of them is
[38:48] going to hurt heaven right right come on
[38:54] is that the Bible no we're not talking
[38:56] about we're gonna get over and grace
[38:57] random now we're talking plain language
[38:59] Lynn the bottle that's what I told that
[39:01] brother this is brother we will have a
[39:04] meeting you know where you want to have
[39:06] it you got three months if it takes it
[39:07] now only want one service I said we're
[39:11] going through the scriptures or what
[39:13] decide we're going to take exactly the
[39:16] wording about that site you heard me
[39:19] done it before when one of the brothers
[39:20] jumped up said why the Bible says okay
[39:22] for a warrant but we're husband married
[39:24] me and I said work Deuteronomy 24 so I'm
[39:30] glad you brought dinner because we were
[39:34] just praying and I was right over there
[39:36] and I'd always wondered why see it she
[39:39] may go be another man's wife and the
[39:41] Lord came down while we were praying
[39:43] because we're praying all night Friday
[39:45] before we left on Saturday and the Lord
[39:48] came down and spoke to them and shows
[39:49] that's not her I'm not even her okay to
[39:51] do it I'm just say she will do it
[39:53] another one I'll improved it with the
[39:55] scripture and i asked the brother i said
[40:00] this brother here said yes do you
[40:03] believe what he said or the Bible you an
[40:06] answer me I said answer one way or the
[40:09] other I said is here I can she put her
[40:11] luck he won't put her husba wait and
[40:13] remind you or anything like that or am i
[40:17] right that she may go because she will
[40:21] automatically go and do it's go to store
[40:23] nature and she's wrong he finally should
[40:28] behave us and let the tape show when we
[40:30] still have the taste probably some work
[40:31] let the brother agree with me that the
[40:34] Bible is right because you can't make
[40:36] things and twist them outright might
[40:39] older brother I said we'll meet on the
[40:40] scripture will lead on what this
[40:43] scripture we just got to read whoo man
[40:45] puts away his wife for any other reason
[40:47] let it be for negation are the word of
[40:50] dog treat after marriage then he's
[40:53] causing her to commit adultery in the Oh
[40:58] out to answer for that right they meant
[41:00] use that blown enough right but is that
[41:03] the Bible sensible to read if he puts
[41:09] her away for any other reason man again
[41:11] he's living in adultery so then if he
[41:15] goes out and does and he's living in
[41:16] another but then if he calls his her by
[41:22] the fact that he pushed her away for
[41:24] just any reason he calls his vertical
[41:28] mid adult and you killed Neal causing
[41:30] her to commit adultery through you're
[41:32] guilty of her sin brother thing
[41:38] tell us how good we are I'm sweet with
[41:41] her the broad across I thought the truth
[41:46] is gonna set us free right now the way
[41:52] you receive the truth you can set us
[41:53] free but we don't know the true knock
[41:55] unit seven do you understand my point is
[42:00] it clear not as you believe it but if
[42:02] they clearly understand what I'm say the
[42:04] Bible fit right now I said if I put my
[42:07] wife away for any other reason saving
[42:10] our exam which is the same
[42:11] interchangeable won't work then
[42:14] fornication then and I go marrying again
[42:20] I'm living in adultery if I calls her
[42:24] right knee I cause her to commit
[42:29] adultery if I'm putting their leg
[42:31] without a justifiable reason but now if
[42:35] I putting her away with a justifiable
[42:37] reason there's no problem I thought if I
[42:43] have a justifiable reason to put my life
[42:45] away and this is justifiable reason now
[42:49] not cutting her we didn't men do that
[42:53] will cover then would it be for
[42:56] fornication or adultery see that I'm
[43:00] pretty that's the ground for he owned
[43:03] this okay not just any grounds when run
[43:08] around said he could put her away but
[43:09] she can't put him away now go back and
[43:12] get the Bible and see who can boot blood
[43:14] away
[43:17] well we don't know what the Bible said
[43:19] can't you read right well we don't know
[43:25] how to read because the Prophet never
[43:28] use the word of dog treat that's okay to
[43:31] put away I'm in red 40 years hungry you
[43:39] will find the quote that brother run
[43:40] says you put your wife away from them in
[43:42] the military but he says for fornication
[43:44] and see then that's what I'm saying the
[43:51] people in this message they hold a
[43:52] narrow line if it's something is your
[43:55] wife done before you marry it you didn't
[43:57] tell you about and then you get married
[43:59] you put her away and marry again but if
[44:03] you're in adultery you know she commits
[44:06] adultery you mean you got to live with
[44:08] her well then no no no what's that lat
[44:11] 40 day we don't have to live with you
[44:13] divorce her for committing daughter you
[44:15] just can't marry again now versus
[44:16] picture for that and is Jesus Christ
[44:20] could do it if Jehovah could do it you
[44:24] know that Adam could have done it but
[44:29] run city would have been burned but
[44:34] where was another woman to come from
[44:36] there's no choices
[44:43] God put away israel in divorcement and
[44:47] the fact that he will never marry her is
[44:49] bride right she comes back his servants
[44:52] not what are you listening so we covered
[45:02] we don't have to get this little dig
[45:05] number forward but and he's talking
[45:07] about can a brother or sister can they
[45:08] remarried marry if they leave their
[45:11] commit companion he says no in other
[45:13] words he talking about Nepal in the
[45:15] corrections and went through the other
[45:17] night that in the Corinthians Paul is
[45:20] explaining that if a woman desires to
[45:23] remain with the man you know right and
[45:26] there's no problems then you don't have
[45:30] grounds to put her way go get married
[45:32] again just call she's an unbeliever
[45:33] right or he's an unbeliever that gives
[45:38] you no grounds let me put it all know
[45:42] that you can't do it you can't put her
[45:46] away just for anything you got the
[45:49] saving for the cause of fornication
[45:51] everybody follow me all right now we
[45:56] went through the fact of showing what it
[46:02] would be in Deuteronomy 24 when a man
[46:06] had taken a wife and married her and it
[46:08] come to pass that she find no favor in
[46:09] his eyes because he had found some
[46:11] uncleanness in her let him write her a
[46:14] bill of divorcement given in her hand
[46:15] and send her out of his house all right
[46:18] then we went through to show you what
[46:20] that would mean it would be uncleanness
[46:22] would be nakedness nudity a shame you
[46:25] dinda implies changeful exposure
[46:29] nakedness of a thing indecency improper
[46:32] behavior an exposure undefended in other
[46:36] words honor now let's get down to
[46:39] something
[46:40] let's just read what's your profits in
[46:46] and I may hit the higher it cut is one
[46:49] of these tales engineer but I don't want
[46:54] you to deal on that bill this afternoon
[46:55] we won't cover that morning to do it so
[46:57] let's go down to number 25 brother honey
[47:02] this is taking some questions unanswered
[47:04] 1959 628 evening service program 187 the
[47:09] woman come not long ago and she said
[47:11] I've confessed that she would nervous
[47:13] and how to break down said I've
[47:14] confessed all that to God I said you
[47:16] have to confess to your husband it
[47:18] wasn't God that you committed adultery
[47:19] again it was your husband that's right I
[47:22] know what if a man marries a woman and
[47:25] she has we've done claim before she
[47:28] marries him and then she comes to him if
[47:31] they've been married ever so long and
[47:33] then she comes to him and says honey I
[47:36] want to tell you something I did run out
[47:38] with another man now this is talking
[47:40] about before you married right this is
[47:43] the women before they married this is
[47:45] the girls before they married if they
[47:48] done something wrong now watch it don't
[47:50] want to tell you something I did run out
[47:52] another man I never told you jesus said
[47:54] he has a right to put her away and marry
[47:56] another and what because they're not
[48:01] married in the beginning because she
[48:06] falsely told a lie against him so in
[48:13] God's eyes if the girl and that's why he
[48:18] goes on downs even this with an
[48:19] excellent and explains that he cautions
[48:23] the people about the valves and the
[48:25] kinds of do it and the marriage and it
[48:27] said in her you know if he meant have
[48:29] any reason but this should not be joined
[48:33] together you have any reason between you
[48:36] that's why I tell the couples who asked
[48:37] me to do their wedding and we sat down
[48:39] with check it over i asked the feeder
[48:41] when you been married before no either
[48:44] one of you been engaged before no ice as
[48:47] far as I go but I instruct I say all
[48:50] right now if you got any problems in
[48:52] your life you need to cover at night
[48:56] because you don't need embarrassment
[48:58] down the road somewhere that you got to
[49:00] tell your wife that you done this or
[49:03] something happens the husband lines up
[49:05] telling the wife you know of what he's
[49:07] done all right so you get it out of the
[49:10] way you enter marriage without any
[49:12] trouble you know how trouble down the
[49:16] road could look he said they wasn't
[49:18] married in the beginning because she
[49:20] falsely lied alright so then he could
[49:24] put her away brother Brown said and
[49:26] meridian one except it be for
[49:31] fornication right so he's not guilty of
[49:34] causing her to commit adultery I'm want
[49:37] to emphasize that right the man puts
[49:41] away his wife and her confessing the
[49:45] wrong she done he has immediately now he
[49:50] doesn't have six months to think it over
[49:53] and heard getting pregnant and not you
[49:55] know what I'm talking about they don't
[49:57] live together six months and then he
[49:58] finally decides he wants to use that
[50:01] because we found another sweeter
[50:03] smelling looking prettier girl somewhere
[50:05] that it wants to marry we're not playing
[50:08] garbage can he has to do it immediately
[50:11] like wave was illustrating about the man
[50:14] that the woman
[50:15] to tell the man until they got to the
[50:17] motel he left the motel immediately
[50:20] without living with her and went home
[50:24] now he live with her two or three days
[50:27] and then sought softly crying cause he
[50:29] got it heartbroken because she wasn't
[50:31] good do it and then he's dozens of you
[50:33] that don't work you getting into
[50:37] adulterous causing her to do this that
[50:39] the other thing you've got to be
[50:41] immediately we know of a brother that
[50:42] married and had 10 kids and then I for
[50:47] 10 kids and all this that the other he
[50:50] wound up said when she told me she
[50:51] wouldn't true to me when we got married
[50:53] well that was ten years ago I mean can
[50:55] kids ago we don't talk garbage man to
[51:01] tell me that I sure you hypocrite get
[51:03] out here that's just the best way of
[51:05] saying you're trying your best to find
[51:08] you some sweet smelling pretty little
[51:09] girl
[51:15] wrong in that marriage after hiring a
[51:18] girl but that's all right that's their
[51:19] big let's go to the next one which is
[51:22] taken from the invisible unit of the
[51:24] Bride of Christ 1965 mr. sweet home okay
[51:30] and I want to name three things that she
[51:33] must not get away from now I'm speaking
[51:38] keep the church in mind while I'm
[51:39] speaking this to the natural woman as
[51:41] Paul this year in the seventh chapter
[51:43] room she does a sacred trust and virtue
[51:45] committee to her by her Lord a certain
[51:48] vercher nothing else holds it with a
[51:50] woman that's committed to her by God she
[51:53] must not defile that virtue no watch it
[51:55] and he even does something wrong she
[51:58] must confess that for her husband before
[52:00] he takes her and make it right now see
[52:04] if you sniff a woman tells a man no
[52:09] what's the point I like to cover it all
[52:10] right if a woman say that letting one
[52:13] that way but illustrating if she had
[52:15] told him before they when they've got
[52:17] engaged and told him what she was what
[52:20] she'd done he cannot use that later on
[52:24] could divorce her feel right because
[52:28] he's justifying her the atom couldn't
[52:31] divorce Eve after he taken her come on
[52:36] actually taken her he's been divorced
[52:38] her that was the point all night now
[52:40] what he says the same as the church that
[52:42] was married to the law has to come also
[52:45] before Christ and we get onto that we
[52:48] can't be married to Christ much her
[52:49] husband David Wright all right before
[52:52] the second max she has to confess that
[52:54] and if she doesn't and she lives with
[52:57] her husband for ten years and then
[52:59] confesses he has a right to put her away
[53:01] and marry another woman that's the
[53:04] scripture fornication is unclean living
[53:07] all right now do you understand then he
[53:12] says
[53:16] that you actually have the right
[53:24] if your wife wants to come and tell you
[53:26] right now I wouldn't true you before we
[53:29] married you've got a right to put her
[53:31] away and marry again now here's the
[53:36] problem you don't find a direct quote
[53:39] that says if your wife commits adultery
[53:42] against you that you can divorce her and
[53:44] marry another but brother branham does
[53:48] say he'd done it in the days of Luther
[53:50] he done it in the Pentecostal and things
[53:53] he divorced them now I've proved that to
[53:58] you went through it that's what makes
[53:59] some adulteress is there still claiming
[54:02] to be married to him the word and your
[54:05] own ideas and that makes it an adultery
[54:07] okay all right I believe a man that you
[54:11] can argue me on this point because of
[54:13] not having a direct quote I believe a
[54:16] man can put away his wife for committing
[54:18] adultery sure but now if he calls his
[54:22] her to commit adultery like I want to
[54:26] cover that you know what I'm saying if
[54:31] he withholds his body from his wife that
[54:35] is not OK in any way all said other than
[54:37] when you're fasting right now I'm cover
[54:42] that the scripture right nobody
[54:43] understand it he sees fasting then he
[54:46] can with Brian his body from his wife
[54:48] other than that he came cuz he does and
[54:50] he called it her to go out and she
[54:52] commits adultery he calls to me that's
[54:54] right so you're guilty caused her to
[54:55] commit adultery you come up in holler
[54:59] glory hallelujah she commits the
[55:00] daughter I put her away boomerang in
[55:03] what did you cause her to do it
[55:09] did you beat her up did you sweater hurt
[55:12] her down her or he's been causing her to
[55:16] leave you and you're guilty of that no
[55:23] glory hallelujah is ok for me to remarry
[55:28] I'd rather have the ground that some of
[55:31] you men comes and I'm gonna put my wife
[55:32] American i won't i want the grounds from
[55:35] you we won't tell the church but i don't
[55:39] want to know it's not first thinking
[55:45] because you don't take a back we done
[55:46] comfort it's not her not cooking we done
[55:50] comfort that right why did you call it
[55:56] have you been a good husband i try
[56:04] did you pull away your body you know
[56:06] what I mean right we're adults and
[56:10] reframe you know with frame from your
[56:15] life if you do that you call her to
[56:18] commit adultery now we're not talking
[56:20] about cause you got sent overseas by the
[56:22] army now with wood is flying we've got
[56:25] everything where there will be no
[56:26] avenues if people can say it no you know
[56:31] yourself and I forgot what it was
[56:32] yesterday i'm looking at something but
[56:35] you know like in World War move too
[56:36] nervous I forgot what the percentage was
[56:39] a divorce is when they came home you
[56:41] know you know you song Dear John them
[56:47] but that don't sister that i'll give you
[56:50] a right to get out and do all the end
[56:51] here you're committing adultery I tried
[56:56] and you're worse than it would be if he
[56:58] was here right because he's not present
[57:01] it's not his fault he got sent away and
[57:07] why would you want to do that and then
[57:08] claim yourself to be a christian right
[57:12] you see what I'm talking about you
[57:16] remember in the quote where we're
[57:17] starting me want that where the sister
[57:18] came to brother Brennan said you know
[57:20] finally he said you were around on your
[57:22] husband and said you did you see that
[57:25] but I could pass that to God he said
[57:26] yeah but you didn't commit adultery
[57:27] against God he commended the dough
[57:29] mr. hood when you go get that wrap your
[57:31] honeymoon first she said he leave me
[57:33] some God's already let you know this
[57:35] didn't worry you are right yep they
[57:39] wound up that she went to the best
[57:41] ocurro's when their husband had
[57:42] something to confess to her yeah but
[57:45] what if it hadn't been that are you
[57:47] willing to put your salvation on the
[57:49] line to try to save your body Yeah right
[57:55] you know what i mean by that what are we
[58:04] willing to do is it crush her that my
[58:09] idea okay now he can put her why she
[58:16] can't put him away i tried when you use
[58:19] number seven we'll just give a couple
[58:21] days and we'll quick seven and eight
[58:29] this is the marriage and divorce we've
[58:31] had these before that's fine correct 256
[58:34] thru axle e250 ages next to the other
[58:38] from marriage and divorce progress 256
[58:40] notice you can put her away but she
[58:42] cannot put him away he did and proved it
[58:44] in a days when Luther Wesley and
[58:46] Pentecost when they refused to become
[58:48] the further part of him by having
[58:50] spiritual sexual apart to become
[58:52] pregnant with the further word of God he
[58:54] said the Lutheran Church recruits Christ
[58:56] the desires of perfusion as Warren
[58:59] refuses a man he's right to put her away
[59:01] but how she refused to how further her
[59:05] to you know little words to live with it
[59:07] okay going down to 58 let's get so it is
[59:12] with the church that refuses to
[59:13] impregnate in the age that we are now in
[59:16] to bring for children this age we're not
[59:19] Lutheran's we're not Wesley and
[59:20] with ten o'clock we've got to be
[59:22] children this age through the pregnancy
[59:23] of the word of God to braid fourth of
[59:26] childhood to say the seat child amen i
[59:28] hope you understand couldn't be pregnant
[59:30] no to what did he do i put her away in
[59:34] divorcement that's right and she does
[59:36] and she does she darken darkness put him
[59:42] away he put her away not now so then the
[59:50] question is whether or not and i keep
[59:52] referring back to this because i know
[59:53] what you're talking around it the
[59:55] message people it the question is what
[59:58] do you believe you believe your wife
[1:00:05] runs around on you would you have to
[1:00:09] live with her some people say you do I
[1:00:15] mean that that's strong that's earn some
[1:00:19] believe you can put her away for
[1:00:20] committing adultery against you you know
[1:00:23] what you can't marry me what do you
[1:00:30] believe
[1:00:37] well we only got what the Prophet said
[1:00:39] let me only use the word fornication
[1:00:47] so then what do you believe i believe a
[1:00:53] man has a right to put away his wife or
[1:00:55] committed adultery against it is free to
[1:00:58] go and remarry only in the lower that's
[1:01:01] right not just a pretty girl no right
[1:01:06] only in the Lord never noticed in all of
[1:01:12] this even the ones in this message has
[1:01:14] got multiple wives they're never married
[1:01:18] their 72 years old and their wife is 69
[1:01:21] or something or 72 like me and the
[1:01:24] wife's coming up 70 just a month or so
[1:01:27] and you notice they go get them another
[1:01:29] wife and they prove that they could do
[1:01:32] it it's never another 72 year old woman
[1:01:36] right it's always an 18 year old ground
[1:01:42] now you tell me that's in the Lord now
[1:01:45] come on no wheat harvest with me I know
[1:01:48] about Joseph being an old man and Marian
[1:01:53] got four kids and then he married mary i
[1:01:56] got a little knowledge but listen
[1:02:04] you can't do those marriages today do
[1:02:10] you know that before Jesus Christ died
[1:02:12] at Calvary polygamy was still legal you
[1:02:21] wouldn't broke till Calvary come on it
[1:02:25] was still legal no Joseph could have had
[1:02:28] otherwise besides memory if he would
[1:02:32] pose it was legal but it went away
[1:02:37] calvary when Jesus Christ paid the price
[1:02:39] the code all types of Christ and the
[1:02:43] bride was over with negative oh hi off
[1:02:47] Christ in the bride coming to Christ in
[1:02:49] the bride was over with all right David
[1:02:54] in his thousand lives that is over with
[1:02:56] it now I didn't say that it done away
[1:03:01] with Christ in the bride down through
[1:03:03] the church ages I didn't say that i said
[1:03:04] what I meant when Jesus Christ paid the
[1:03:10] price that is it polygamy
[1:03:14] because it would only one Christ and one
[1:03:17] breath she's many member of yet but then
[1:03:21] the show that you're coming back to the
[1:03:23] beginning are we not referring to that
[1:03:27] and starting with that in the beginning
[1:03:29] of it all in one male and one female and
[1:03:34] in the body of Christ we are the
[1:03:37] feminist all of us men and women where
[1:03:40] the body of Christ so that gave big
[1:03:42] blank in it right see we're not talking
[1:03:49] anymore
[1:03:53] you talk so long but then you you wind
[1:03:56] up you know a canoe is the top of a big
[1:04:01] boat ocean liner but once you get the
[1:04:03] ocean liner you know what you get to the
[1:04:05] basics of what finished it's finished
[1:04:07] you can patter it up hurry it up make it
[1:04:10] look better but still run aground it's
[1:04:12] like all the rest of us it's about you
[1:04:16] don't jump it up out of the ground and
[1:04:17] make it a plane that's another time all
[1:04:22] right do it Calvary ended the polygamous
[1:04:27] right now it's one man and one woman but
[1:04:38] honey the man puts away his wife or
[1:04:41] committing fornication and marries
[1:04:43] another how many why does he got okay
[1:04:47] you're brian says to sorry you can't
[1:04:50] count he's only got one
[1:05:01] Jesus put away the loser to marry
[1:05:03] dimension is I mean wives design the
[1:05:06] Lutheran's was the wife until the time
[1:05:08] came that they were divorced when they
[1:05:10] were divorced that were no longer his
[1:05:11] wife he wasn't married to the Lutheran's
[1:05:14] he was married to the westin so he only
[1:05:16] had one life if a man can legal and
[1:05:25] rightfully and God put away his wife
[1:05:26] American he doesn't know how to live in
[1:05:28] wild and he doesn't need the grace of
[1:05:32] marriage and divorce because he's
[1:05:34] legally rightfully doing it right what I
[1:05:39] said if the truth was told about it it
[1:05:41] would save a lot of problem but if a man
[1:05:49] push away the way I believe it you can
[1:05:50] do what you want to have leave the man
[1:05:52] puts away his wife then later they
[1:05:55] married and she commits adultery he can
[1:05:58] put her away and marry again he still
[1:06:01] don't have one life man why would it
[1:06:07] stay about him that it says the husband
[1:06:16] of one life I was talking about
[1:06:21] administered omena deepens when you had
[1:06:23] to change the word from bishop t.d and
[1:06:25] half the husband of one wife I wouldn't
[1:06:28] say that if it wasn't for the fact that
[1:06:32] if they wife committed adultery she's
[1:06:34] dead because that's what we just read is
[1:06:36] she done it before and told him he said
[1:06:38] it wouldn't be married to start because
[1:06:39] she lied much more to live when a woman
[1:06:42] goes out running around with a man and
[1:06:44] that's to come in but why would you want
[1:06:47] to run around them say it I read it to
[1:06:49] you come on were human where I he said
[1:06:52] if I done something wrong my wife would
[1:06:54] forgive me he said if she does something
[1:06:58] wrong I would forgive her I believe in
[1:07:01] forgiveness but I don't believe it for
[1:07:04] two or three more time that's now I
[1:07:08] believe it for one time but if my wife
[1:07:13] told me about I'd say honey I forgive
[1:07:15] you but a month or two later she told me
[1:07:19] again I Johnny now this is mounting up
[1:07:21] to vice we can't count for this I don't
[1:07:24] agree with it I just try to cover
[1:07:31] everything that way you'd allow no
[1:07:32] loophole for somebody to come along with
[1:07:35] what about this well I'd uncovered what
[1:07:36] about that you see a lot of people could
[1:07:42] be free and don't know
[1:07:47] I demand to be free and don't know it if
[1:07:51] they just know what was their wives and
[1:07:52] what happened but I covered it if he
[1:07:56] calls his her by with praying himself
[1:07:58] then he's guilty of causing her right so
[1:08:02] you may not be guilty of adultery be
[1:08:04] killed it called an hour to commit I
[1:08:06] thought so you going to answer to God
[1:08:10] for causing her is your justifiable
[1:08:14] reason for causing her no but if he puts
[1:08:19] her away for the legal route of what the
[1:08:20] scripture says then she causes herself
[1:08:23] he ain't guilty even though she goes mad
[1:08:26] 20 more times need not guilty the
[1:08:31] difference in heaven but believe me the
[1:08:34] youngster I asked you to ask God what it
[1:08:39] is that you believe it because that way
[1:08:43] I can take all the tops in the shadows
[1:08:45] and bring it all the way through the
[1:08:47] cross in a church our husband has got to
[1:08:52] be day it took more this afternoon not
[1:08:56] just divorce the Prophet settle
[1:08:58] invisible unions and hung up in a closet
[1:09:00] did you read that are here today but
[1:09:05] he's got to be dead right you need to be
[1:09:08] married to Christ that's where the
[1:09:10] trouble was when Wesley come forth with
[1:09:13] a fundament of the word some people of
[1:09:16] the Lutheran's cook what they believe
[1:09:19] and moved into the Methodists period of
[1:09:21] time and would be the bride of Christ
[1:09:24] but those who rejected Wesley's message
[1:09:28] they denominated on that and died do
[1:09:36] they put away
[1:09:37] they're dead I'll bracket this afternoon
[1:09:43] I didn't think about it but another
[1:09:45] animal flashing red lights with his
[1:09:47] coming he covers the scripture about 11
[1:09:50] you know doing time he said she's dead
[1:09:53] lost you ever that's what it is is she
[1:09:57] did moment in light of her husband go
[1:10:01] ahead and do something wrong she's dead
[1:10:05] that's why he's rightfully legally can
[1:10:08] remarry that's why it's not stated that
[1:10:10] he can't remember remember marriage

[1:13:23] married to it was about it say adultery
[1:13:25] you wouldn't say about that fornication
[1:13:28] and adultery everybody wants is that it
[1:13:30] why does it say she commits adultery
[1:13:32] because they need one of mad no
[1:13:34] intercourse and had no contact is just
[1:13:36] because he looks at her unless I to her
[1:13:39] yep he's committed adultery with her
[1:13:45] what am i dead like a fellow told me one
[1:13:52] time he said looking is not grounds for
[1:13:54] divorce that's in the natural law but
