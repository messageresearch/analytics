========================================

hallelujah hippos you amen amen he'll do that thing 171 in the red book that third verse is my my favorite verse in that song right there i'm gonna be in g to understand what it's saying this excites me amen oh oh day and they tell me that my eyes shall be oh amen we're going to change the order of service now amen it's going to be open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open the to see you pour out your power and love as we oh i have everybody with us gene and kathy back there with us can you see them you can see uh andrew and rachel now them with us tonight so we're just pleased to have you sister carver he's back there so is that sister berkey we're on the other side just make yourself to home that's the best thing to say amen you're not turning your scriptures turned to revelations 1 where we've been we've reading quite a while now in the study of the book of revelation so we just keep easing along very slow and uh getting to a point and now remember tomorrow night the lord willing i'll be down at brother uh collins is there in lincolnton uh preaching for him tomorrow night so remember that we've got a hard day's work tomorrow working on a deer hunting land and then preaching but that'll be that'll be good too because it'll all work out you may just pray for us the lord bless us and keep us all in his love amen uh remember now not this coming saturday the next saturday will be the uh bible study here at church six o'clock then the following saturday for the ministers only there will be a minister's meeting here at the church beginning at 10 o'clock and then going through the day and having a good time in the lord and then the third saturday will be the fellowship meeting which will be at brother tom crusham's so remember all of these announcements that's been made amen revelation 1 1-3 father we thank you for your love and the understanding of each and every one of us we thank you for you but we know if we gathered tonight that's one thing but for you to be in our midst is a wonderful opportunity the children of israel felt and believed that they were your children as they journeyed through life but the more that they began to realize that you was with them the better everything was so is it today and we pray that you would just bless and guide each one and keep us lord open our eyes that we may see forgive our sins cure us lord into your love and got each one in jesus name amen so we've been reading from revelations three i'm realizing one verse one through three on these services so the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said it signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and you may be seated surely if john could right back there the time is at hand here we are 2 000 years later surely we would comprehend more about that time being at hand all right now what has been our thought we've been trying to cover um something here on a study on the book of revelations uh this is message number 13 so we just keep on going and trying to understand but what has been our main point see a lot of people have told us you know stay out of the book of revelations you can't understand it well that's true if you don't know what it's saying you know and you don't understand the the uh the symbols the things you know that are there but then when once you see the book of revelations though then you can see that it is a very simple book it just needs our understanding to be changed instead of trying to figure out all of these monsters and beasts and get our mind out of the tv world and movie industry you know that's running all this garbage can stuff and get it down to simple thinking then you know we can can uh begin to understand and what is our point that we've made in the book of revelations it is the only book the prophet said whereas jesus christ personally appearing to ascribe to write the book into what is it we just read it's the revelation that god give to jesus to give to john you say well that's trinitarianism isn't it no no that's no more than i'm a father son holy ghost i'm a person i'm a general motors employee i'm a pastor of a church i'm many many different manifestations but uh there's just one of me and there's just one true and living god so that's where we we believe it all right now then as i told you the book of revelations you won't find um the lord jesus christ just specifically by himself that's right it's a it's a book dedicated specifically to express what he was he is and always will be because we read in hebrews 13 8 that says he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so now we know that jesus the flesh wasn't back in the old testament with the same god that was back there one day walked on the shores of galilee back there and you know in a human body right and now that sign god is living in the bride of jesus christ here living and has been down through ever since the day of pentecost living in each one of the church ages through the bride of christ all right and seeing them that's the the point is to see ourselves that's right and what the word of god is talking about you and i see if you ever want to find yourself just read the book of revelation right then you read about these things and but when you get to the to the points of some kind of a symbol just remember the bible is written to hide it from the eyes of the wise now we think it's been written to where it can be explained no jesus said it was written to hide it from the wise and prudent the word that everybody can't comprehend it and then we read in the bible where it says no man can call jesus the christ except it be by the holy ghost you see anybody you can get anybody to stop him on the road and get drunk as a coot and he can say jesus is the christ yeah but that don't mean he's saved no it's when you've got an experience in your heart and then you speak from your heart who's dwelling inside of you and then you can say that it's jesus christ all right so we got down uh there this past sunday trying to deal with where we're over in chapter four if you want to go over to chapter four with us and uh they don't have to pull this up but we'll read a little bit from revelation chapter 4 in verse 6 because we've taken our time coming down to to this position and uh verse 6 it says before the throne see now let's you know let me express that because you go to revelation 4 1 through there and it talks about a throne we see you're looking for some kind of a great big throne you know well how could you have that big old throne and a whole lot of people sitting on it it'd be a big old throne but see the throne is the kingdom of god amen that's right jesus when speaking there in revelation 3 21 right along in there he said he that overcometh was it with me in my throne as i've overcome and sit with my father in his trunk all right so then the body the human element of god is in heaven right now it's not here upon earth and it's on the throne it's on the father's strong sitting waiting for a time and then when time is finished then he'll come here to pick us up and take us away all right now so then a throne in heaven is not a great big thing like that it's a kingdom it's domain it's a right it's a place you know understanding so then get that point and then you'll understand the rest and before the throne there was a sea of glass like a crystal this is john describing what he sees he's taken up as an example for you and i in revelations 4 1 of the rapture of the church and going up into the heavenlies and as he's doing he's describing what he sees but what's he describing it by symbols right just like uh who was it ezekiel when he saw fire falling down out of heaven seeing a nuclear destruction well how did he describe it fire falling down out of heaven he didn't know to call it nuclear the word didn't exist right all right see naman says chariots jostling in the streets running like lightning well it's very simple symbolics if you just take it right what just you get out there this evening when you start going home you'll see what he's talking about right you'll see a bunch of cars running down the road with headlights on and that's what he saw but see it's breaking down into simple things and thank god that he sent us a profit to break these symbols down to us to where we could understand what the bible is talking about and that's the purpose and the reason for him coming right yes sir was to not bring us another bible not to give us something different but to bring to our understanding what is already written in the word of god amen leave them that way then we can understand it so watching what he's doing now he's describing what he sees but now watch him as he describes it i wish you could draw some of these things out you know but how are you going to draw it because he just and before the throne there was a sea of glice like at the crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne now how can anything be into in human terminologies how can anything be in the midst of something and round about it right we automatically see that it's not talking about our human terminology see human terminology can't comprehend the word of god see but when you're seeing jesus christ make manifest here in these examples and all the things you can understand so what now there was in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind now four beasts all right now we look at it like some kind of a movie that made with these great monsters you know king kong you know well now we're not going to see anybody right now your thought like that i'm in a great big animal walking across the earth going to deceive everybody no he's going to stomp everybody all right but now think about what it said and these four beasts were full of eyes before and behind that's right all right so now we found out there sunday that what our beast is a power know a beast you talk about a beast a horse a beast and you talk about horsepower it's the power of the beasts how much stress can be brought forth by the animal as you would say so then they come along they put it in a car and they made it out of metal and called it horsepower then they put in an airplane flew up the sky they caught it horsepower then they put in astronauts you know they put it in rockets and send them into outer space they call it horsepower it just simply means a power that you know can be used the thrust of it to do anything or the power that it is all right now so then we found out sunday that what this is a power among the people all right a power among the people we went back into ezekiel and picked up ezekiel where he was seeing this odd-looking contraption it looked like a um um it and then he'd see horses pull it and they'd be running like vitamin and they'd be just going every which way and then he finally wound up seeing the wheel in the middle of the wheel well see that wheel in the middle of the wheel is the lord jesus christ and that ezekiel was actually seeing the travel of israel right amen their journey down through the wilderness from leaving the you know canaan and i mean leaving uh egypt and going towards canaan and they were in travel right and ezekiel is explaining what's taking place that's a very simple understanding beast means power and you go to ezekiel you'll find that there are these same things now what kind of beast would it be full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf or an ox and the third beast had a face of a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle amen now how could you draw that out what kind of a picture would you have if you were trying to draw out these things you can't do it so then you got to get down to see what they all represent and see as i said ezekiel it represented a travel of the children of israel that's what he saw he was raised up took up and saw their journey going down to the wilderness the travel that was taking place now then when it comes to the point that you see here in revelation john sees it raised up sitting in a position in heaven right all right so he sees this it's doing this brother reading him leaving against his brothers been in bad shape so let's just hold have a word of prayer when we have going to be evidently in bad shape lord jesus we ask you father to just bless brother there be with him and lord take care of everything we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen and see these these things is being described now you'll have to take my word on the basis of what doing to talking to you and i as far as some especially that um you know are not familiar with wordings we use but in the book of revelations you find the word beast all right in one form it is called a zoom z-o-o-n all right now in other instances that's taken from the greek other incidences are places it's called the ron p-a-t-r-i-o-n all right now the zune is a living creature amen but the theorem is a wild untamable beast unconverted i think wow so you got to know which beast you're talking about when it just says a beast all right these beasts that we're talking about here are the zoom z-o-o-n because they're the creatures they're actually not uh angels you've got to take it all the way through we will this coming sunday so don't worry about it don't try to get ahead of me they're not actually just to say angelic beings you know because you've got to deal with in heaven there's angels there were angels that failed all right for lucifer's life all right then there is a lower form of from coming down there is like seraphims then there's cherubims and then there's just angels and that's why they can fly through heaven and they can holler holy holy holy but those have never fallen they they don't have to be saved they didn't fall they didn't fall after satan's life the others did and they have their place waiting all right but when you come to hear say you're dealing with this living creature and that living creatures i said so when you there sunday then ezekiel saw it in travel with israel john saw it in the position and glory but then by being able to comprehend the signs and the things are taking place then the prophet of god could bring to you and i and we could see it down through the church ages and see what would take place amen all right so you got your line your ox your man and the eagle all right then you get into matthew mark luke and john that's right matthew was the line of the tribe of judah see coming down you'll find him being more word related on a lot of points mark his ox are symbolics you'll see more of the you know like mark 16 lay hands on the sick and they shall recover etc but then luke was a physician he was a doctor and he was a man smart right all right then john would be more into the eagle age or evil side because he was chosen to go to patmos and write the book of revelation so then you can tie it up and bring it all the way down and then you can come down to the ages and bringing it forth to be able to see you know the point but my main point is to get you to see one thing tonight what i was trying to get you to see there sunday you got to line the ox to man the eagle that was the ministry of god among mankind because when you started out you started out with an early church with the word of god amen in the book of acts and they held that true until you even get over into about the fourth church age where you're coming into you can see them back here behind listed like martin in the third church age but around said no man had a clear understanding of the godhead in saint martin great signs and wonders took place dead rays sick healed even columba we got to a chance when we were in ireland to to go over to they pronounced it clumba it's not colombo we use come low blow a lot of time but it's not just columba all right and we had an opportunity to actually visit his home place you know it fell down and all the work was but he was a great man of god these men stay true with the word of god amen then you get what would be known in the church realms of calling the dark ages in the dark ages you find that there was a lot of people killed there are 68 million by the catholics on records of christians that they killed that's right oh of course they claim they've repented of it well i'd like to see it but that's what they say you know but they're still doing all of the things but anyhow the oxy during that period of time there was a sacrifice if you wanted something to read that's really great get the book fox's book of martyred right amen if you've got a good stomach you can read it you don't you won't be able to how that there's people holding a cross up in front of people that claim to be christians and saying deny your belief in jesus christ and accept virgin mary and her doctrine or we'll kill you that was the ox it was a spirit among the people amen just as it was with when you're coming down from paul iranius columba martin and him they were great men of god who stayed with the word of god and tried to hold a church straight right and in about 325 a.d they had what they called the nicean council and they started out picking up the doctrines of the trinity and the things from there to that point but see the ox was the sacrifice and you read that fox's book of martyrs work like i said here's one on one side claiming to be a christian the other one on the other side claiming to be a christian and they're they're killing the real true christians records of them cutting the women's belly open and taking the baby out and feeding it to the hogs right man you read the book that's what i said she got a good stomach that's records that's not something that was faked or ideas it was actually records of what took place i remember one of them was thor the butcher or something like that and he killed over a hundred people in one night but see they had the right to while they were catholic and they went down and they got forgiveness of their sins before they went out and done them so it didn't matter to them how many they killed or what they'd done but that was their ox that animal is sacrificed and jesus had already spoke he said unless a corn of wheat dies and goes into the ground said it will abide alone but said if it goes into the ground he said he'll come forth in other words in a multiple form just like you you put a grain of corn in the ground and then you go out later and you've got a ear of corn with many many many kernels right on what you you see that early church had to go into the ground right but then it started coming back out and a man named martin luther then he went forth with a message of the judge shall live by faith yes he did sure there was a lot of fanaticism with it sure there was a lot of wrongdoings with it but still it was the word of god it was a reformation to begin to be reformed for what they were right and it wasn't long until luther and their teachings and he had passed on you know and they cured his message and they got it sold to it was just looking back just like it was before because they got it to the place that they wouldn't even have a revival in the church because and i'm quoting from the church history of the baptist church that they wouldn't even have a revival in the old what they call independent badges and the reason for not having revival was they thought somebody might get saved that god didn't want them to get saved now that's in history see they got it down to where it was just we're just living our lives we're christians with john wesley come out amen started preaching sanctification bring the church out of those things and bring it back to a a life lived right he even said it the black coffee had no benefit in it his house burnt down one time and they called him he got there as it was falling in according to records and he looked around he said well we don't have to worry about this anymore right literally recorded in his own writings that he was trying his best to live a good christian life yeah now where's the message today we're not throwing off on them but i'm just asking the question john wesley's talked so much on on doings until you know they turned against him right and even his own wife according to records would drag him around in the house by the hair of his head and he wouldn't step on him so sure i wouldn't let my wife do that well maybe we don't have what john wesley come on right right maybe we don't have what he had see there was your man shrewd but see first was the line the next was an ox those are symbolics of animals but then the third was turned to a man see smart shrewd man and god dealt with mankind through those ages under that spirit of that time that power that was among the people that he sent out right then you even come on over into azusa street bring in your pentecostals because azusa street was not the one that's doctrine there were trinitarians on azusa street still under the man and dealing with those things all right and see then the one this doctrine began about somewhere around 1914 12-14 of the oneness doctrine and came out and began to do and the ones that were original of justice street a lot of turned against the truth when the oneness began to come forth but see there's your line your ox and your man down to the ages but they're on azusa street a great thing happened because it was the power of god coming back among the church that's right that's right but around him on 464 the seal book said another great prophet then he said there was a messenger sent at the end of the age right the road around never come to zeus's street he said you try to make me the pastor or the leader of zeus treat he said you have him in the wrong place did he come on after resistance see then he was the equal man but remember lion ox man eagle he was the eagle he was a prophet amen jehovah eagle prophets in the bible were referred to as eagles why because they could raise that way above and see a way over right amen around here we we very rarely see eagles because they're not subject to this part they are a few here they've tried to install them again and the swamps has got a few and different things but eagles like to live where they can soar high and go amen see a prophet is signified as an eagle because he has great eyesight right you wouldn't do a a pigeon or something like that or even a hulk that is a cousin to an eagle but that hawk can't see like that angel that eagle can sit in his eyes as a way it can fold over he can fly straight into the sun right into it see because he's made that away amen that's right see then malachi 4 said that they would be a prophet come amen and a prophet in this age see bringing the message into it now just like the other day when they were had that thing on the tv thing they say there's over 2 million people now following this message you think this is a small thing it's beginning to be a big group over 2 million people already on record that are following this message around the world all right see but now a lot of people sure have made wrong things out of it that's true because they always done it in the days of martin luther they've done the same thing right amen the days of john wesley they saw done the same thing just the street is the same thing but the fourth one was to be the eagle because an eagle is a special made bird he's a ripper with a beak you want to eat now listen watch what i say and then what's what i'd say again behind it a real true eagle that you're talking about symbolic of a prophet is an eagle that is a ripper with a beak that he won't eat nothing rotten right all right but there's over 40 something different kinds of eagles but around stephen said that 40 something different kinds they're actually eagles that are almost vultures they'll eat just anything those are not symbolic right you can't use that as an example but you see a real true eagle in order to get those takes on the eagles when the man that baptist preacher was preaching it was kids i think you know he was preaching the message about the eagles and how they're done and how they they go through what they call a moping period and how you pronounce it they go so far and then they just start covering over with all kind of fungus-like stuff and stuff gets on their beaks and they can't eat they hardly do nothing but if they can make it through that period of time and the other eagles that have done been through it they'll go up and get meat and drop it if if that eagle can get enough meat to live he renews his strength what the bible says right here amen he comes forth just like he was you heard of you he always goes to the rock where he was born from that's his resting place but he comes for strong that's right but he has to do a lot of things to do that he has to actually knock that stuff off his weight he has to get enough strength his feathers come down all kinds of things happen but that's a real true equal we're not talking about the 40 different kinds now so somebody hear it they think we oh they don't know there's many vulture eagles yeah we'll just put it up front here and tell you there are plenty of them because they have a lot of hypocrites around this message that are calling themselves eagles too that's right you need to make it a good buzzard right it's where i don't pull no bones yeah i stand on what i stand on and say it period right but listen equals now everybody okay is the part of the combat beast for the line the ox the man and they'll say it's the spirit among the people but then when you come into this message and you begin to think about this fourth combat beast to be the eagle we'll see they say yeah that was brother brown now brother branham wouldn't god that's right we don't believe in junk that's right brother random himself i was listening to a man the other night now i just thought he didn't emphasize enough we was but brother brown made mistakes in life he was a human being right you know that moses made a mistake moses smoked the rock when he was told to speak to the rock read your mouth those prophets themselves in their lives had problems because they were not what is the word they were not infallible right but here is the one point their message was yes sir amen sure martin luther was a trinitarian and even okay to kill him to the jews or so they need to be killed but yet his message of the just shall live by faith is infallible right amen now not what man has took and added to and done this out of the other but the message of the justice by faith is the word of god the word of god is infallible but the person that is in can make mistakes and things right there's no problem with that that's just the human side of it that's what caught me in the message was the honesty of a man that would tell his about his own thoughts and failures he wasn't telling all how good he good he was he was telling the truth about his life and what he was going to do he was going to take that gun and kill them boys to turn pumped out 20 something bullets trying to kill these boys and them running because they beat him up and everything he went back and took the bullets and put him in the gun and everyone fired it was god taking care of him he got so down and out when his wife and baby died until he climbed a pole that's what he was kind of like a lineman of different different things you know and do it took the glove off and was going to take a hold of the power line he was a human being and when he come to he was laying on the ground god took care of his man but the man himself sure run around the man the human being he was a human that made mistakes dr whitehorse writer was a the holy ghost and then had to change that to where it would be the antichrist when the seals would break but his message was infallible that's what i'm saying i'm saying that we're following an info this bible to me this bible the message of this bible is infallible this is the word of god amen if not what do you believe you believe you are him yeah if you don't believe this bible is the word of god you believe you're god no no no brother i don't believe i'm god well why are you trying to straighten everything out yeah that's right i told somebody this morning about it i said you know i didn't use these words but i'll use it here you know the devil's angels is all gone on vacation let's think about what i said all the angels of the devil the devil is going on vacation why don't make them no more preachers in this messages or nothing devil don't need no angels you got a lot of them and the bible says they're called as ministers of righteousness amen but it's the combat beast but my point has been what you go down the road and you look out and you see eagles on the buildings of people that are not even know anything about what we talk about a prophet eagle you see them on people's houses you go in a store and look around in a novelty store and before you leave you're going to see a bunch of eagles right right come on you didn't think about it this is the equal age this is the age and time of finishing all things up being the eagle age see it started by profit being able to bring a message to you and i am but he wasn't the only eagle right and we're certainly not talking about somebody come to bring another message beside the prophet right man no but what are we amen what are we church that's my point tonight what are we i believe that combat beast was in those people in that early age and you had the forerunner people of paul and irenaeus and them sure they were the messengers of the age but the spirit of that age was in the people amen yes sir so is it in this end time that when the prophets came and brought the message unto us early man years ago most of you would have got up and run out of the building a lot of you would heard a man and he said should you say brother around as a prophet said he just to come make way for the prophets and i thought i'm going to listen to what he's got to say of course it didn't take me long to figure out what he's talking about he thought he was the next messenger to take over you know but we don't need no next messenger to take over that's right this message has introduced us to jesus christ that's the one is to take over not samuel dale or nobody else right it's god himself to bring his own message to the people now did we say we believe the fightful ministry to take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the lord within the fivefold ministry you mean they're not worth nothing they're not in anything see church if we just knew what happened if we would just realize what happened there in the end time when that prophet brought that message to the people and the people began to be the message of the prophet right you know you know we talk a lot about david and that's wonderful hey would kill goliath that's great wonderful statements but you know david then he just went over and sat down he's done his job the children of israel is one whip the rest of them we don't think about that dude maybe you don't like my words maybe they're not good words or just see anyone over inside them my point is he done his job when his job was finished it was up to somebody else to take over right see the prophet of god come and brought us a message we've got the books to take your computer you run off anything you desire of what he had to say but what about in our hearts and mind amen oh but brother dale we're we're up above all of this we're not in them denominations and things it's all right we're independent but we're going to read in a minute where brother brown said a baptist or a methodist can give birth to an eagle you're gonna have to argue with your prophet that's where people don't like me because i find what he says and and i bring it to us and try to show it to us but i believe in the spirit of jesus christ being in you and i all right amen that prophet was not almighty god but god used that prophet to bring a mention moses wasn't god but you ever heard brother brown say it like this he said when moses was speaking he said he was god to the people but said when he stepped back he was moses again all right when he was up here speaking to the people the message was infallible come on but when he stepped back he was human he had problems brother made a statement one time he said one of these days said the black and white will fight again and die like flies that's a direct statement but you go to the next message he said i made that statement this morning that the white and black would fight again in dallas life he said that was just my opinion he said that wouldn't does the lord you see the man himself can be a problem but his message is what i meant that's all i've ever done right is try to get you to look into the bible and take what the prophet has brought to us like the book of revelation breaking these symbols to it making it simple enough until a 9th grade idiot like myself can comprehend what is being said our children know more about the truth of god's word than most theologians in the denomination that we're in america why because we've heard the truth amen right what is it one beast was like a lion next beast was like a man that i mean a calf the next beast was like a man and the lights was a flying eagle you know the other three could take to the air the line the oxaman they couldn't take to the air they had to have some support to be able to get them up into the air but the eagle doesn't have to that's right that's right he just swore i told you about it i experienced it myself seeing one i was sitting in a place over in south carolina hunting down in the swamp and there's a great big cut this way went about probably 300 yards and it was about 50 yards wide and a big cut going this way perfect place to hunt because i could cover both food plots you know sitting right in the middle and i could look this way that way you know i was sitting up there and i looked and i seen this thing come down and wider wings than my arms and it just dropped right down in coming this way and it came right up to that thing right to the middle of it and turned and went right out the other way and went right out the other end of it and it was down in the trees where i was at i was sitting up probably maybe 12 15 feet high he was down in there where i was at having that cut he never flapped one wing he soared and turned and went right down never flopped the wing he went right up over them trees it was 30 40 feet high he just went right up like that and soared out he knew how to handle this all right that's what god likens his prophets to eagles right he's jehovah eagle amen but now who are we who are we i don't know how far we got along with what we're doing but brother joe just pull up for the number nine and ten which is matthew 24 and luke 17. i take them a little bit because when i give them these they're way over in the message all right here's matthew 24 28 it says or wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagle be nine safe did i miss revenge that's how easy it is but we read it this way for whatsoever the carcass is there will the eagles be getting together yet brother brown it doesn't say that right the eagles all right now i can't express it and i'll express it again i'm not talking about somebody else to come to take over in this message now get that out of the ideas now if you and on tape or anybody else 40 something years i've been around i ain't done it yet so don't worry about it i ain't trying to find somebody to take over i know who took over when that prophet left the scene the lord jesus christ because that's who he was looking for to come and back him up he said in the seal book there'll be a great one come he did he came to that opening of the word and backed up what that man said yes sir so the dead was raised the sick was healed all kind of things took place but you see we come over in this and say well it's not for you and i great men have said that third pull you know it's not for us but brother around said it was far the bride and the church that's right and to the totally lost that's a direct quote do it evidence to somebody you ever seen the debt ready i have so we don't have to worry about it you don't have to worry about nobody gonna argue with nobody about to take no argument about it that's right no man can raise the dead that's god to raise the dead god can use man to raise the dead talk to brother dick letter about if you want to in the presbyterian church when they raised people was raised in the dead see we only want to take it over to brother branham now i'll go to the next one luke i'll have this one this is the same state but look what it said and they answered and said unto him we're lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is neither will the eagles be gathered together the body word right carcass is an animal right a dead animal a carcass we call it eagles eat as i said the eagles we refer to as in the bible form he's only a ripper of the beak that will eat fresh killed meat he ain't like some of these things that take the animals and just stuff them up there and leave them a little rotten about highway go back and eat on it you've got to be fresh the fresh word of god where the word of god is the eagle shall be gendered amen around that word amen now come on folks why don't we talk plain what are you doing here all right what are you doing here i don't mind talking like that now a lot of you probably don't want to be here and when i preach you you don't agree with that's all right that's your business maybe you don't have nowhere else to go but what brought you here certainly wasn't a beautiful church in a fine pastor and a big choir no putting up with me see church we are little eaglets we are the children of god if he referred to himself as being jehovah equal why can't we refer to ourselves as being his children amen i thought by the new birth we were the children of god and we're little eaglets all right so get them two scriptures now that we use where the carcass is the eagles plural will gather where the body is the eagles will gather to that body word amen why have you come to this church that's right most of you have told me personally they didn't have another word where you was at so much reason you come here right that's not bragging on nothing but jesus christ that don't exalt me that exhausts jesus christ because you see i know who the jehovah evil is and i know who was his eagle that prophet that brought the message to us but i know you and i are supposed to be eagles yep right amen you wouldn't just as he saw it in the sky we've got a sword in the sky that's right somebody's going to walk off this earth one of these days in the rapture we better consider the eagle and especially to put it to eagle with an astronaut now time i read that an eagle is like an astronaut never been ladies have an astronaut for this age they started flying planes back there right close at the ending up with zeus street but no astronauts this is the astronaut age right you see an astronaut he don't have anything to do with getting where he's going he just gets in the plane he has no control of the takeoff right the people in the towers once guided me so it's nothing but jesus christ all right let's read a little bit okay just get the point to where you can see it i'll just scan through to pick up some of the pull-up number seven brother anderson he's back there now appreciate these brothers that's right look what your prophet had to say about it he's talking about revelations 10 7 he's been referring to the last angel's message what was to happen and all the mysteries of god would be revealed you see the four beasts that rode that was perfectly right that's still alive the oxymoron evil you believe that and now here's each age and each power that road behind it and there is a scripture that shows what that what the enemy's ride did now remember the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard right not me and you raising up one the spirit of the lord raised up the standard did that's been revealed and they sealed and also it's been revealed now that each big power that god set out to combat is hit exactly on the dot up to the eagle time now if this is the last time there will become an eagle that's right and that now remember now in the days that the line came the original word about 100 of one 100 of them listened to the line and watching dropping dropping her in the days of the the ox came there was a teeny bit drop of them listening to the ox missile in the days that the man come he worked among men you see so he was shrewd he got a little group and what did they do satan's seen that so he just sends them right back and marries them into it and remember when the eagle finally comes it'll be 100 of one percent that listen it's an eagle age now i'm gonna go ahead and say it and then read it only eagles can eat eagle food you better realize you're an eagle right or you are not you're a vulture which one are you brother ryan said a true eagle will understand if he's a true evil now come on only eagles can understand the eagle message right yes we wouldn't design for no other age that's right it was designed for this age lutheran western didn't have no astronauts right right they even have airplanes but think about it when the eagle finally comes it'll be 100 to 1 listen all right so let's take that 100th of one percent i'm not a mathematician i'm just saying this if there's two million people following this message that would probably be a whole lot less than one hundred to one percent when you know you consider that the baptist has probably got 500 million or more that was years ago you know so it's a small group right amen right even if it's 2 million that's a small group small percentage compared to what others are why because they won't hear it amen and listen church only as i said only eagles can understand right all right drop over to jump over to number 11 brother joe my brother anderson this is taken from shorts to father 1961 521 and look what he says so i looked and this big eagle jumped up and talking about where he was at and out in the storm in colorado we have the brown eagle great big beautiful bird and i love eagles because god likens his children his heritage unto eagles and god himself calls himself an eagle he is jehovah equal papa eagle where his little eaglets an eagle can fly higher than any other bird there is if a halt would try to follow him he disintegrated in the iron so you try to impersonate christianity you just burst yourself open that's all don't do you no good be an eagle be born again nature change then you can walk with jacob up jacob's ladder get born again and under the anointing of the age that we are your eclipse right by the new birth amen no no no no no you'll get brother dick after services he's been watching for five years these eagles and how many has been born in this nest and how they all learn to fly and he's experienced it every day on this computer watching them do something different you know they're so nice they don't poop in the nest after they get big enough they hang over they'll be surprised when they're baking see a lot of things smart birds but get bored again right get a nature change why oh we're a pig a vulture right is that what we are when we're not converted he said letting off the pressure 1962. 609 he said i was written here not too long ago i reached a subject called the eagle's church's nest in chicago i was reading about a certain kind of an eagle there's 40 different kinds of them they claim needs that ripper with the beak god always likens his people to eagles he calls himself jehovah eagle so he said 40 something different kinds of eagles all right so he knew what he's talking about and his little eaglets that's those who are born to him and i made a little remark of that one time talking about how the eagles gets little ones ready to fly takes them in the air and turns them loose you know they take them out there well they learn to fly under eagles well what good would it do to take a buzzer down what good would that be now watch what happens in the end time number 13. taken from the fifth seal of 63 322 paragraph 188 my a revealer of the truth that's been following all truth been falling all through the age so how in the world could the ox or the or the man or whatever beast was writing how could it ever be revealed until the eagles you read do i need to put my finger on it eagles come they had their place everybody had they were godly set beasts just the same as anybody else but the line was the original that's where the antichrist come up in the in combat then he raised up another power he sent a power to meet him he raised up another power and he sent another power to meet him and then as a life's power he brings down the eagle to restore the children back to the original faith again of the father fathers the eagle age need you to know research no more beasts there's nothing else out there all right going to the next i'm just reading these facts i don't want you to get it is it off the countdown 1962. now in this astronaut age now that's where we're at right there's also the astronaut age agent is spiritual what is it did the church come from an airplane like a natural they took a higher flight one that astronaut there's no airplane going to catch him he's done gone to where he can't even see an airplane no more see and that's the way god is doing now instead of being some little school guy come out and talk about certain things that dr so-and-so said years ago we got eagles plural prophets plural rising up into the heavenly the far above the earthbound chicken we've got eagles amen and we've got prophets amen well they know no there's not another major prophet but according to the scriptures there's apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers right that's in the body of christ that's the ministry right yeah but see we don't read those things so-and-so says it's that's what we take so we'll see in a minute he's not a feeder of eagles so what and if it happened in the horse and buggy days in the automobile days and the luther lutheran western what about now what's the matter people talking about being modern they call that modern this is the modern this is the modern according to the kingdom of god no astronauts glory astronaut age cure eagles god's prophets rising on the scene how thankful we are for that what is it spiritual manifestation of spiritual word become literally fulfilled before us that's right amen the word of god manifested once was hard to understand now it's made plain to the astronaut the position of the church that should be plumb into the heavenlies not down here floating around through the clouds and buzzing around like an airplane but something that's propelled by something that sends it beyond anything that an airplane could think of it's an astronaut that's the age that we're living in now spiritual astronauts you know how that man always denies anything you know they said there was a person making a speech about one day that it would be to work our planes would you know people would start flying and doing different things and the story was told that this man got up and got his two sons and said let's get out of here he said this ain't nothing but just heresies this is this is stupid jump who could ever think about flying an airplane so he got his two sons and he walked out the door his two sons was named orville and wilbur wright so they evidently didn't listen to daddy right right see look mama she looked great mama was her day right that's wonderful i love my mother appreciated her for taking care of me and raising me i do but if mama was wrong mama was wrong i ain't saying my mama was wrong well she's wrong she's wrong i'll say it for you see that's not throwing off a mama mama didn't understand that's right man that's right i mean man used to think if we went out so far that the world was flat and you went out so far you just drop off the edge well you know what that kept ninety percent of people from going out to the edge that's afraid to fall off but you know someday one one guy went on out and he just went on out and he just went on out and don't find that he found out it was a curvature how many of you have ever been out in the ocean you've been out in the ocean right yeah you ever been 26 36 miles out you can't see a thing 12 miles i think is the limitation of when you're leaving out the land disappears and the lights is the highest building disappears well it's like somebody would have figured out that that was had to have something to do with the curvature but you know that you know now i can hear the quote from brother brown let me give you a quote he said see there the world has got four high points to it he said they proved it when they went to outer space they didn't say the world was flat he said that four high points to it but you see church listen it's time to get away from mama and daddy and and thanks hooty and whoever and get on in the word amen i asked josiah question one ago i said when that baby gets here friday will that make you a brother or a sister he thought for me and he said a brother well i was just asking the simple question but listen church do that get you the life get you off the astronauts the age of the astronauts we got equals we have profits because see i believe in the five four minutes yes sir in doing that then where are we glory astronaut age sure eagles god's prophets rising on the scene how thankful we are for that that's the quote of just opponents astronauts is eagles he goes beyond all denominational creeds all denominational barriers sailed into the heavenlies why because he's an eagle you know why an eagle can fly do you know why an eagle can fly because he's born an eagle right simply right that need anything that needed a big idea on your heads the reason that eagle can fly is because he's sneaking he's might go away he's made to fly see he's made to want fresh meat for the real true eagle that ever gets a good belly full of this word amen he just wants more worms right i mean i don't understand a man asked me the other day from ukraine he said he said you know should i go to a denominational church well if there's no place for him to go yeah sure because you're gonna go to church but if there's a church there that believes even part of the truth you'll go to that but if he's an eagle maybe he'll hear this if he's an eagle he only wants equal food but you know the little eagle that was hatched out in the chicken yard you remember the story that the old farmer took an eagle egg and put it under the hen you know and it hatched out funny looking chicken walking around you know but you know what he picked up worms and the stuff that the chickens need to live but one day his mama come over screaming and he took to the air well you know what a lot of people don't ever realize about that story was you know that little eagle took to the air and you know it wasn't long no mama chicken better run when he found out he's an eagle she better go high because he's hunting something deep right he's an eagle yeah the reason the eagle conflicts because he's an evil the reason people believe the word of god is because they're born again amen that's why we believe the word of god because we're born again people right all right see then we're not trying to figure out what somebody else is saying about it he said oh eagles today that's why you're here your eaglets but if the crust has begun to build blind your eyes the cures of the world you can't swallow all the food of god you know that's why i'm talking about the mop into the eagle so you just got to worry he can't eat nothing if he can survive long enough to get that to where he can break that off of and he can fly again that's the only animal that does that look at number 16 i'm having to jump them back there so i'm sorry this is questions and answers reel 1 1964 8 23 in the morning you know that's what the uh the uh news thing they've got that now you know and some people don't know about it but they was they got it on there now you know i have a news cast up in uh indiana that's put out about brother branham and the things you know and they're really making a mockery out of a lot of things and it's on the tv and uh they said they still play them old 1200 and something tapes well i like what joseph said back to him is his response he said we're still reading that old bible that we've been reading now for thousands of years you just still reading that same mobile you know what i've got a lot of writings of luther as much as i get a hold of him i love to read about it i read the things of wesley i've read the things of azusa street i love to read them you know but then i read the message and like i said then the messenger of the man that brought the message he's got problems he had troubles he made mistakes and caught things wrong and different things but the message isn't followed so that's what i want amen that's the eagle's food right so watch what he's getting to matthew 24 28 or whatsoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together now that's what it's the person's question who is the carcass and who are the eagles oh that's a good question nothing wrong with that what is the carcass the carcass is what the eagles feed on now an eagle is considered in the bible of prophet prophet a prophet is the eagle god god calls himself an eagle and we're eglets then the believers you see and what is the carcass that they feed on it's the word wherever the word is the true nature of the bird will show itself now watch this in a minute because we're going to talk about vultures you know that vultures come around after the message has been destroyed no i'm not talking about the truth now so you get it off your head i'm talking about the people of this message that's made of the garbage can then it's become a place for vultures to feed right all right so this list will get to it he wants fresh meat he must have his fresh meat he's not a buzzard he's an eagle you can't give him no denominational stuff to him he's got to have eagles food that's the freshness of the meal not what moses done not what somebody else done not what sankey finney knocks calvin but right now don't then was right in her day where right now the meat that's killed for this day and that's the part of christ that died to make this word be confirmed that's what we want to eat on that's what eagles you know okay going to the next one he's not average to shook this is number 17. but the main point is just getting what we're talking about it's been hidden from the wives of the reformers chill away from it until the age of the eagles appeared he's not just saying right come on look at the next one number 18. she's not able to show up same message did you ever see an eagle compromise no sir there's no compromising in him neither does a genuine christian he ain't soft he'll hunt till he finds it amen yes sir he'll find his meat he wants fresh manna he'll get down there and dig till he finds it he'll fly higher and higher if there's none in this valley he'll rise a little higher the higher you go the more you can see so it's time for eagles of this day to get to flying higher amen come on are we reading dig into god's promises not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago and live on vulture food that's right let's make sure we keep this in the right respect let's read this one number 19. showing you we're talking about the new birth is what makes you an eagle the anointing of the age is what makes it the eagle age right all right it was born again in luther's age it would have been the man's spirit age and the new birth that would have been leading us if we'd been born under the ox we would have been learned to sacrifice time and that new birth would have led us to give our lives for the gospel right now what are we supposed to do the presbyterian church methodist church baptist church any of them can bring forth these eagles that's your prophet that's not me cure is the atmosphere that does it as dr bosworth used to say you can take a puppy you know and tie it down over an egg you take an egg you just take a dog and tie it down on the eggs it'll hatch him eggs right it's the atmosphere you say well you mean to tell me their denominations can produce a birth i wish you hadn't thought that i'm dirty don't mean no god i know but i wish you hadn't thought that cause a lot of you believe you got the new birth before you come to this message now see don't play with me with words don't think you can trap somebody that knows what they're talking about you say you got the new word before you come in the message so you had to get a new word while you was in a denomination somewhere you better start believing the denominations could produce a birth i believe they could i never denied yours mine's just different i never denied yours why because the atmosphere may be getting pretty bad now there i don't know if they know my business just get in the atmosphere get the atmosphere right what is the bottom part of it paragraph 7d let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in the heavenly worship get the atmosphere right eagles will be born and out of any church ever people don't like that because they think the denomination can't produce a birthday you better better be quiet because see i'll just expose that part most of the people that believe that believe they come out of the denomination got the birth before they come out of it my wife don't like me to make faces on them on that internet system where they can look at you come on get that you pop and smoke it just a little while you're going to either have to tell your congregation that you don't have didn't have the new birth backer and got it later or you better tell them it could happen come on not trying to be nothing but what i am okay what are we up to go ahead to number 20. this is from the easter seal 1965. oh god send the holy ghost and look out them eagles some word that's ready to stand younger no matter what takes place that'll soar into the unknown not sit on the telephone wires and look for some sunday school literature to come in now brother i've been having to do no problem with sunday school literature he had sundays too mr what's he talking about when you take sunday school and you make it just being the only thing that's of god you know or i mean just you know you you put it out there and just make a lot of it it's not right okay let's do a couple more real quick now here comes one that's sticking in my face number 21. is the rising of the sun well you say well now let me tell you something my pastor i don't care what your pastor said it's what the word says right if you want to be a chicken go on with him but if the pastor speaks different from this word then he's not a feeder of the eagles uh-huh he's a feeder of the hens see not of the eagles eagles eat on eagle's food it is quicker so determine how what people are saying look at this next two anointed once the end time paragraph 2 14 where the carcass is there the eagles will be gathered where the carcass where the the killing is dire the eagles will be gathered whether where the fresh meat is the word of the season then the eagles will gather but after it's rotten what then the vultures will swarm to it yeah see what i mean when a kill is made here comes the eagles but after it lays there and rotten then here comes the vultures the eagles won't have nothing to do with it after it gets rotten's maggots in it then here comes the vultures they can smell it you know that's how they go by look at the lights when we quit on this is paragraph 253 that's where the true eagles set down to eat yes sir that's where the true elected eagles see what it is when he can't take that word they know right then he's a denominational vulture i know this or not be done but i ask you another question why did you leave the church he was in and come here it shouldn't it certainly wasn't for my uh you know me doing it to bring you here why are you traveling about to do it the only thing i've ever said to you is if you find more words anywhere else you let us know where we can go eat i said that from the beginning i'm still here because you let me know where there's more word that i'll get the person to come here and speak to us because i want to eat some fresh meat folks i like good fresh meat why can't he fly why can't the vulture fly like a needle because look what he's been eating he's been eating on rotten denominational caring now you know they're the ones who hear the words don't understand us brother brown had nothing against the people in the churches it was the system of the church i have nothing against any denominational church this is a great friend of mine right over here do anything in the world for me not with him i have no problem with it's the system that i'm against amen not the people i have no trouble with any people in the denominational church the poker rome i have no trouble with him i ain't gonna kiss his ring not sure ain't gonna kiss his stuff but the thing of it is he's a human being but i'm against what he teaches the system of the thing right that's why he can't fly because look what he's been eating he's been eating them rotten denominational carry that that won't spiritualize his body won't put him in a spiritual fitness in other words he in other words to carry him up above the denominational difference it won't carry him up above it he just read on rotten stuff his body is made out of that he can't go up there where that fresh meat carries that eagle he just can't do it i said it while they go then brother joe gave it to him before came out brought around when it's arriving the sun said the holy spirit coming down to quicken make alive those people that's foreign ordained of god to be in the rapture that is if he is a true equal he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true equal that's right man if he's a true he's right yes sir if we're true eagles we act like eagles right we're trying to just be what god made us what is the spirit of this age equal age astronaut age beyond all the other ages and things an eagle age that new birth that you have with the anointing of the age that you're living under and we're eagles luther was an eagle right all they got the new birth is eagles right right come on but this is the age of the eagles to be made manifest right i hope now you'll go back and look at the times that the prophet said eagles plural and we're definitely i stated again not looking for somebody else to come over to straighten brother brown they've tried to put me in every camp since i've been in this message and they just couldn't fit anymore and that's it just don't work why because i want the true food feed don't you i want to true me to the other message i'm not satisfied with just going to church and being good and doing good works and deeds you know helping the widows the orphans and the missionaries and the printing of the books and the thing and we do everything we can but i like a good steakhouse now if you want a good steak you get zachary you can take an old piece of slab meat and make it taste good because he could good steak i don't mind paying for one but i hate to pay the price of them and it come out to be so grisly and all kind of things in it and it's so tough you can't eat it i like a good piece of meat it cooks just right something you can lick your chops on as you thought like a brother said he was going hunting one time he said you eat this steak tonight he said you won't be hungry in the morning he said that'll take care of you i said give me two books and but you see eagles won't fresh me amen vultures and things is satisfied with tail stuff now i've never made these statements like a lot of people's made you know that we need to get brother branham off the scene i don't go along with all those statements a lot of preachers in this message said we need to get brother round them off the scene where we can go on i don't agree with that because there's people just now beginning to hear the message so you can't get him off the scene you got to keep the messenger here bringing the message to those that are just getting the message but i do say one thing and i've always said it i want something fresh every day and i pray lord give me this day my daily bread my wife's even said why do you travel to a lot of places and go knowing that they're not preaching very much i said i go pray and i pray for one crumb if that's all i get you tell me you went to walmart and got something different and you know what i mean by that you tell me you just went to where you went and didn't go to eat then i'll just take my little piece of meat that i get might be called wrong for doing a lot of things but i'll just take my little piece of meat and you know what i'm looking for you know eagles don't like to buddy with other birds you don't see vultures and eagles buddying together if i have to walk along and walk alone i ain't worried about it because it's always been eagles if god sent along to believe the word that's right i believe it's just time that we start flapping our wings right raising up a little bit and soaring on getting to the place that we can understand you remember brother random about that eagle said it was sitting there he said so he spoke to and said don't you know eagle that i could get my gun and shoot you he said that eagle wouldn't work at all he said he knew before i could get my gun and pull it he said he'd be gone in them trees he's learning how to trust learning how to walk let's stand come on musicians eagle age waiting for the eagles to come there was no need of bringing an evil message if it wasn't going to be eagles to be able to eat the food you see what the trouble is then don't you now what a lot of people tried to do with the message they took it and light it up and let it get stale and then they can come back weeks or months later after it's rotten and they can be like vultures and they can just pick out what they want to and you know i believe the two souls the 700 words are crucial the true eagle amen he just wants true feet eagle age i preached this 40 years ago so it's no problem for you to think that i'm trying to no i'm trying to tell you the truth we need to just realize who we are and start flapping our wings down in the yard our house went down these hawks used to to raise little ones up above us there before terrorists put his house up there and they'd raise the little ones we'd see him every once in a while in that valley out in the front there you know one day i was out there and i saw that little one that he come oh he was just boy he was you could tell he was just he would have him a ball and it's probably maybe first time out nest he was
