book of Deuteronomy and chapter 29 very familiar for scripture I told them everybody else around here this thing would work on but not me try that I'll try not to I'll try to hold my sand to steal yeah that's right that's right I don't I don't know how many times they'd have to make when how long it takes them make one of them right there yeah yeah three or four of those five or six of them I don't know hadn't seen any really big Filipinos yet there might be out there somewhere so if we went and seen them yeah yeah exactly they're in America amen well God bless you it's good to be here tonight and uh we're gonna look into the scripture not y'all just pray for me tonight before we go to the word tonight have just I have a couple of prayer requests as a man that I work with things Eddie and uh he's uh had some heart problems and his heart won't stay in having trouble with staying in Rhythm and they've had to shock him and give him medicine and everything like that and uh I talked to him and uh he said it so far it's been staying in Rhythm but he's been nauseated and the doctor didn't want him to come back to work but he but he came back anyway and he's been very weak and but I got talked to him for a little bit and uh he uh he said well I've been quoting never healing scripture in the Bible so so uh but but I told him that no we'd be praying for him tonight amen he said he needs all the all the prayer he can get and and um brother Greg Gadson called me and some of you may not know who brother Greg is some of you made the may know brother Greg he's he he's a precious black brother pastors a little church over in South Carolina I've been to a few times and he called me and uh just got some situations going on he he's requesting prayer and so I told him we'd be certainly be remembering them tonight and the Lord knows Lord knows the situation we don't have to know the situation we just we just believe and bind our faith with theirs but uh he always he always asked me every time he talks to me on the phone he asks me how brother Dale's doing and how the congregation's doing and uh he always tells me he said uh to let you know that he sends his love to all of you amen and so he just wants to greet all of you and just remember they pray for you and they're just a handful of over there but you know they there's precious people we really enjoy going over there and being with them and uh you know it's uh you know just like just like in the scripture where the uh Balaam had the mule talk to him you know I just want to be used of God and and you know brother every time I talk to brother Greg he just so uplifting but um you know he told me he said brother he said you came and preached at the church and he said you didn't even know he said it had to be gone because you didn't know what was going on but he said you couldn't have preached any better sure and you know I just and so you know I'm just so glad that I've been able to be a blessing to him and in some little in some little way that you know just God lay it on your heart for the to say something to somebody to be encouragement or or give an answer or whatever it is that they need because you know that's what brother Brenham said if you had a question on your heart God's obligated to put a man behind a desk and answer the question that you had on your heart he's you know it we're here to be used of God to break the the yoke that Satan had you know he said that he has over your eyes that he's got you blinded so you can see that God can speak to each one of us and you know many times I I feel like I've I get spoken you know I get I get I don't know how well y'all get blessed I get blessed lots of times sometimes up here just and you know it's when you just yield yourself to God and and let him come on the scene and speak so we just want to commit these prayer requests and I know there's other ones and uh y'all just pray for me I it's been over a week now I uh I stepped off a little thing at work slid on a plastic mat and about fell down and caught myself and I uh I knew I knew not to uh play softball that's reason I was trying to play catcher I wasn't trying to hit because I knew I'd mess something up if I did but I had to go to the doctor today and get some of that uh some of that faith building stuff in the pill form today and uh they they think I might have messed up my meniscus in my knee and uh so y'all just pray for me I feel a lot better I started getting on some of that anti-inflammatory medicine and it's went down some but but I tell you y'all just pray for me I if y'all if y'all look at me and I'm hobbling that's the reason that's the reason why I'm trying to stay off as much as possible and the doctor wants wanted me to be out for Thursday and Friday and I told him I said well I may be up tomorrow but I ain't gonna be up the rest of the week but uh I mean it made him go to work tomorrow so Lord touch me I may feel like running running around the building amen so y'all just pray for me tonight we'll just uh bow our heads we'll read uh Deuteronomy chapter 29 and just see what the Lord has for us tonight our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you again tonight and Lord for your blessings on us Lord that we're able to gather in your house and Lord together with those of like Precious faith Lord to look into your

closer to you and Lord we know we're getting ready to go home and father we just pray tonight you just help us as we look into your word we just pray that you just come speak to us tonight help us get out of the way and Lord just give us what we have need of tonight we pray for Eddie there at work Lord Jesus you know his need Lord just strengthen him in his body and for brother Greg and the in the church today our lord Jesus you know you know the situations you know what the the needs are and Lord it's it's it's something when a brother calls you and they have confidence in your prayers Lord and Lord I have confidence in this Church's prayers Lord that we can bind our faith with theirs Lord that you'll make away answer the answer the need whatever it may be Lord we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask all these things amen amen Deuteronomy 29 29 very familiar scripture one little scripture here says the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law amen you may be seated God bless you well that's what I want to speak on take a little thought on the secret things of God and you know what I was listening to brother Bob last Wednesday night and he done such a good job and amen amen we had a real we had a real good time when we were in Alabama and uh went to went to the Midnight Church felt like Paul and Silas having church at midnight yeah yeah but uh told Brother Bob that and told some of the other ones said brother Bob he done such a good job but said he felt like I felt like he was like a a jet engine when I'm planes on if you've ever been on a plane flying out of Atlanta when they Roar up those engines and they got the brake on you can just feel that thing rumbling all the way through the through the plane and you just waiting for them to pop that break and that thing to take off well brother Bob he wasn't like he wasn't like brother Jewel taking off you know they say bless it blessed is a man that preaches a a an hour sermon in 15 minutes and preaches a 15-minute sermon in an hour well let me tell you Bob was doing all they could to stay on this side of Eternity I think he was trying to hold back he was doing such a good job I tell you I really enjoyed it and he carried some of that over Wednesday night and I told him you know if you if you can't get excited when when brother Bob preaches you know they just need to take you out and bury you because I think you're dead but brother Bob he done such a good job trying to you know because you only we only spoke for about 15 minutes over to the Guatemalan brothers and and it was it was so it was so good and I appreciate the Lord what he had what he had for us you know it's good to see those that are hungry and thirsting for for God and and you know those Brothers you know they're they're seeking for what they can get and even even though they don't speak the language or don't speak much of the language but you know they're thirsting it and hungry for the word and it was it was really good and I appreciate brother Bob and uh just wanted to just wanted to say that to him kind of embarrassing a little bit because he's back there laughing but yeah man but it was it was it was really good and it's too bad he wasn't taped I tell you he done a good job for 15 minutes so I'll tell you it was but uh brother well Louise can tell you it was good and all the brothers they done they done a real good job but anyway tonight I want to speak on uh the secret things of God and brother Brandon go into uh this is from the 70 weeks of Daniel in this uh quote number one here and the background for this brother random is speaking of the of the earth and he's speaking of the of the condition that he talks about the uh the different calendars and how how the Earth is out of cater and out of balance and you know we can't hold these things in into the time frame that that we look at because uh with the Earth having going through the brother random said through the end of deluvian Destruction the prophetic calendar doesn't match up with our calendar anymore so you can't follow any of these things but uh he said it just only shows that this is just a period of Time Can't You See God don't have things out of cater he's just running he's letting it run like that for a little time and I I truly believe that that thing was done and at this last days is when God is going to reveal these things these secrets to the church he hasn't done it before and the reason he hasn't done it is to keep the Churchill watching and praying all the time not knowing when it was coming but you remember in Daniel 12 he said the why shall I understand and and the last days it's been given to him he said the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day that we're living in just the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church and the last day to reveal these great deep secret things and so we know that this is our time and God has come to make these things known and um you know some sometimes when I study I just you know I I don't believe you know Brothers say we don't believe in organization so sometimes sometimes that's the way my notes are they don't look like they've been organized but I know where I'm at y'all you know so you know they said they were reading some of my notes I asked them I said well did y'all say Amen well it's not as bad as brother random was talking about you know he drew diagrams and all kinds of stuff nobody understand what he was saying but but uh you know sometimes you just put things together and you don't know which direction you want to go until later and the Lord's trying to shows you things to how to how to go and what you want to say but um so if I bounce all you know if I bounce around I'm gonna work brother I don't know who's in the back tonight brother Joe I don't know somebody's waving back there so anyway Hoover's back there y'all gonna have to work tonight you don't have to earn your pay tonight bless your hearts but anyway um you know the scripture says in in Amos 3 7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so you know there was a it was a secret to being made known in and in Revelation 10 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and you know you know we've been over some of these things before but you know the definition of a mystery because I want to look at things you know because he said the secret things belong to God but he said to things that are revealed belong to us and our children but you know the thing is is if you you know brother Branham says in in Christ the mystery and we'll get into that he said God had a secret he said God's secret mystery you know that he wanted to make be made known and so you know we know those things but a mystery is something that's not is not understood or it's beyond understanding he said a religious truth that that no that one can know only by Revelation and cannot fully understand because you know brother Brown said even through the mystery being revealed there's a secret part that's not revealed and so a secret is is something that's kept from knowledge or view revealed only to the initiated designed to elude observation or detection working with hidden aims or methods and you know that's the reason that in the scripture that Jesus spoke in parables because he said it's given unto you to know the Mysteries but he said unto them it's not known and so he spoke in those and they said Lord explain The Parables to us and so then he goes and explains the Parables but see he spoke to the people so that they would know what he you know the word was made known but the secret of that was made unknown only to the disciples and so there was only a certain group that that was made known to and so you know many times what we look and and we speak of the uh the Mysteries and the secrets being made known but you know it's a secret until there's something that's revealed because you know God brother Adam says that God had had a plan and a purpose that he wanted to be made known and so in in the beginning there was a there was a plan but it was not made known but you know nobody knew that and and even when in the scriptures when he when he started to condescend and everyone brother Brown speaks in Christ's mystery and he speaks of the prophets he said even when the prophets was was making known Jesus Christ but he said it was only a shadow he said it was only them prefiguring Christ but he said that was only that was only being made known but it was still a secret because the plan and purpose that he had was a secret and as he was starting to make these things known then it became a mystery that's the reason that when Amos said surely that God will do nothing but he'll make his Secrets known Into His prophets so it had to unfold unto something so it was a secret that was made known to the prophets so then that became what they done and then when you go back to the uh the fathers the found you know in the beginning you know he said the the Patriarchs you know laid the foundation who talk about Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph coming through and laying the foundation he's talking about uh you know laying uh election and then justification Grace and uh Perfection so you know he talks about each one of those things each one of them showing what they came to do and then he said then he said the prophets built the body and so you know they continued on to make known Christ in their own way but it was still hidden all right man and even even from the beginning God even even from the beginning and all that he'd done he he was making himself known even when he started to condescend into the into the son of Unto the Son of God and he started to create you know even all those things that he took that took place that was still him showing himself trying to make himself known in every in every aspect and even even when when Satan was there and Satan knew that uh some of the things but you know he can clearly understand the uh plan of that God had but you know even later on when he tried to get into the Garden of Eden and he tried to mess up the plan of God and corrupt the plan of God even then he couldn't stop it from taking place because that's exactly what God wanted to take place because you know he put man on free more agency that he knew what was going to take place but even when Satan tried to stop it it was working right into say into God's plan that was going to take place and then he stood there and he told he told Satan he said I'll put enmity between your seed and her seed and the seed of the woman so it was already speaking of what was going to take place but that was what his plan was from the beginning and they already had promised prophesied that they would be one that would come and he already had prophesied the destruction because he said he said he will crush your head he said but you'll bruise his heel well because he knew see that that headship was leadership is power but if you crush his head if you take his head out then there's no more power then he becomes powerless but see when he spoke of it stepping bruising his heel see there had to be a uh a Frailty of humanity that that he had to come through because man had to fall the Redemption had to come the same way so when the humanity when when man fell then there had to come one in the likeness of sinful flesh to do the same thing to come back to bring us back so you know because even even when Jesus Christ stepped into Melchizedek and he came and he spoke to Abraham and he prophesied to Abraham and he gave him the promise he still couldn't be the Redeemer even though he was able to meet and work and fellowship with with Abraham he couldn't be the Redeemer until he came through the womb of Mary until he came through that way and when he came that way see then he could overcome but it already been prophesied to do that why would it cause the victory had already been taken place and see Satan didn't see that and no one else saw that but until God came down and started speaking through the prophets then he made that secret known and then it became a mystery right then it was mysterious and then that's the reason in the last day see there's many things that are spoken of in the Bible but there's still a mystery it's still mysterious until there was one that came that's the reason that it said in the last days when the son of man is revealed he wasn't revealed in the scripture he spoke of himself but no one had that revelation there he stood and as as brother Wade was speaking in Mobile and done a fabulous job of speaking on the on the son of man when the son of man would be risen again see he had to come back and he had to be risen again why because they had to crucify him again so there had to be a it had to go through that and it had to fulfill the scriptures amen and that's the reason I'm so thankful one because the more I sing in the Scripture it fits absolutely perfect with the scripture everything that took place you know I I you know I thank God that I say that because you know some people people that say well you know brother Brandon wasn't wasn't Vindicated and he wasn't who he said he was and all these things you know you just got to be blind you just don't have spiritual eyes to see who the prophet is one because it it takes the Assam of the word that comes and anoints your eyes that you can see who you are and you see who he is n't it it's not you know I thank God because it wasn't anything I'd done but it was God's grace to me that I can see these things I thank God that we've been what we've been able to see hey man we're we're a blessed people God is God is so good to us I tell you the more you get into the word the more you see yourself and the more you see you see Christ and you know I don't know about you but you know sometimes you you get like like Bob said you get so full you start leaking but I tell you what I you know because you see it's a love letter and you know brother I said you read between the lines well you know you're not looking at other people you're not looking at other things you're looking at you right and God Brethren said if you don't if you read in the scripture he said if you look in there and he said you don't see Christ in every verse he said go back and read it again because see it all speaks of Christ all the way through and it speaks of you and I he's him speaking to us now what I want to I want to look at tonight and and looking at this in this Secret and these secret things that have been made known I want to look at the life of Elijah and you know because you look at and you know you're certain things that you just stand out to you and and you know I hope I hope you all can see it because it it's just beautiful to me that you see and you know because God spoke through all of these and and Christ was made known in all these and um it was just it's just really beautiful to me but uh I didn't I didn't give them this scripture but uh it's in First Kings 17 and when you when you start to read through the scripture here and uh want to get into a few things and um the first thing is when when Elijah came you know Elijah came and told them because of the wickedness that Israel had done he told them he said because of what you've done he said Dew will not fall he said until I call for it he said he said it'll be a drought he said it's going to be you come into a drought time he said it won't rain or do for for these years until I call for it according to my word and and when you know brother Brown said that that because of what took place when he spoke when Elijah spoke to the people you know it didn't it didn't affect them it fell on deaf ears and when he saw that he was speaking the word into them and trying to bring them back because of what they had done then he told he told Elijah he said I want you to come with me to the brook of cherith he said there's a place I want you to come to that's away from all of them why because they're not going they're not going to listen to you so I've got a place prepared for you and he said he said when this drought started then it all became dry and you know the spamming started and and brother Adam goes on and he speaks of this famine and you know the scripture says that there will come a famine in the last days and brother Brown said you you uh think we have a famine today he said you just wait he said we've not seen a famine yet because there's coming a time where it will be very hard to hear the true word of God and and so when he comes and he brings and he brings the by the the brook of cherith and you know he he brings him out here and out to the Wilderness and he and it just to lay a foundation out you know because you understand when you read this what stood out to me and and reading brother Branham you think of the people that they're all in this in this drought this famine and people are dying and everything is going wrong and you know what he has a prophet that come out there and he told them he said it's not going to rain on my word but you know what not a single person came to Elijah to find out what can we do to change it right amen he said all about crank tell him to go on we don't need him we don't want him say you know what God had a place prepared for him took him off to himself and there he sent by this Brook and while this well this Brook was there you know the the scripture says that he that he had the Ravens came and fed him in the morning and in the evening fed him bread and flesh morning and evening and he sat and drank by the Brook and you know there he was he was in and Elijah was in this in this resting time he was just resting and he was enjoying himself and then in time the scripture says that the that the brook dried up and you know in the in the time when the brook dried up God told Elijah he said now he said I've got a place prepared for you he said now you've sat beside this Brook and he said now he said I've got a place I want to bring you to he said there's a widow woman I want you to go and see and when he comes to when he goes to the to the widow woman so here uh let me read this real quick this is from the message Jezebel religion and this number two brothers he said he said what did Elijah do he said I found he found a Hidden Spring Way up in the mountain where he got some Water of Life Divine Revelations from God as he said up there under the power of God the revelations being a little Hidden Spring while the rest of them were famishing he said God bless his servants some Ravens they brought him something to eat while he was isolated from the people and they were down there famishing for Revival and everything he said don't hear no more of his revivals at where's that old Crank that goes around blasting our organizations where is he at now they don't know God pulled himself he pulled himself with God an isolated place where they didn't hear his voice and then they began to see and he says God sent forth a message to tell the people and they don't receive it then he withdraws his servant and he sends plagues Fame and death spiritual spiritually sleek and physically also you watch for a depression brother you think you've seen something you just wait for a while you haven't seen nothing you think you're dying for a good spiritual Revival you wait till after a bit you just wait long and cry to hear the word of God the Bible said so there'll be a famine in the last days of the prophet and not for bread or water alone but for hearing the true word of God but that voice will be quiet in the wilderness somewhere head away said he ordained the Ravens his servants bless them Birds his servants that kept the voice of Elijah during the time of his isolation from the church the Ravens brought in flesh and bread at mourning and fresh flesh and bread in the evening and he drank from that little fountain where the rest of them down there we're doing without any spiritual food and water right so and then he goes on to speak about uh Jezebel how Jezebel took away everything and they were under such a such a bondage but Elijah had a place of rest and he was supernaturally fed during that time and then we go on and he talks about you know at a secret place ordained for him that he was that God provided a place for him said he would none of this would run out but uh continuing on when God brought brought him to this place and had had all these things for him that he was able to to rest and got a supernaturally fed him these things and then when he set up while he was setting up there and the world was in this famine and everything's falling apart you know the the thing that really stands out to me was you know here's here's Elijah going through this Supernatural feeding and this in this resting time and yet you go and read and this little widow woman brother Brandon the scripture tells us that he said that uh he prepared her and he commanded her to feed him that there would be a time that he would that she would feed him and you know brother Brandon goes on to tell us that you know here she is sitting beside the uh you know watching everything dry up and watching watching the the meal disappear and all around her all she sees is death and brother Branham also goes on to tell us that you know how she had had prayed all night night after night after night trying to seek God because she saw what her situation was and and everything is going down and going away and she's praying to to God for for an answer but you know what he was waiting for her to get to the place that that she was ready and he also says that she had a husband that died in this famine he said he said when she lost her headship and brother Brian goes on to say there's organized religion but when she lost her headship he said then she was ready to hear the prophet when she lost all of that then she was ready to hear the prophet and she got to the point where you know she she had nothing and and but you know there was there was Elijah coming out to her and you know she had nothing and she would just had that little bit and was getting those sticks she's gonna build her little fire and and cook her her little bit yeah and then you know Elijah says you're you're just just amazing you know that that he comes up to this one with a woman and you know it's a famine all throughout the land nobody has anything and you know you imagine that nobody has nobody has nothing but he comes and asks for the most most precious thing that there is from any of them exactly he said give me a little give me a drink of water you know I'm sure that went for a lot of money back then when you were when you're doing without water you just about give up anything you own and so here they here's here they are going through this this time but he says can you give me a give me a drink of water and and she said well you know we just have have very little and then when she goes to get him a drink of water and he says oh can you make me a little make me a little cake first it's like what this man comes in and now he's wanting everything I've got he's coming he's coming to get my take my water and now he's trying to take all the all the food that we have and she says well sir we only have just a little bit and we're just coming and you know I'm just preparing to die I'm gonna make I'm gonna just take these two little sticks I'm gonna build a fire we're gonna cook this little bit that we have and then we're just gonna die and then you know Elijah told her said you know he said make me that little cooked cake first but he said he said by the word of the Lord he said he said the the meal a barrel will never run empty and he said the crews of oil will never run dry and then she went and and done that little bit that that she had and she gave it unto him and you know there was a they went through this little time of eating just this little bit but you know after that then there was there was no time that she ever went to that Mill Barrel that she ever was empty and The Crucible never went dry and here she was going and and the prophet said that you know Elijah stayed with him with her and fed him all the way through this time and here come this time where they were just continuing to eat off all of this one and she gave of the of her lack of her need and that's what she gave of and brother Brown said you know God doesn't want what what you have a lot of he wants you to get what you have a little bit of he said he said you know we thought we think we're so inadequate but that's what God wants he wants you to give of what you have what little bit it is and if you give that then God can bless you right and so you know she gave her that little bit and it's so amazing that here she is famine all the way around her no no doubt there was people everywhere you know no doubt that was people everywhere that you know I you know because when you get hungry and when you get thirsty you know what you're going to go out and you're going to start looking for it you're gonna start looking everywhere you can find it and it's so amazing that nobody ever found out that this woman had all this food oh see they were eating and Elijah was eating with her and you know what nobody ever come by is knocking on hey can we help can we get some of that you know just like just like the Queen of Sheba you know traveling through the desert you know she was she was more desirous to find a Solomon and see see the work of God through Solomon that she was about the robbers and you know they were all throughout the desert and no doubt every night that she was in the desert she was you know she that she was running a risk of being killed or being robbed but you know what she had more of a desire to see Solomon than to go through because all of that was inconsequential well because she had a hunger but you know it's so amazing that they they were there and able to eat one because there was something that God had done for them and it was a secret to everybody else everybody else is in the midst of this of this famine and everybody's searching and dying and guess what this woman is eating inside of her house and she's full and in the midst in the midst of of all of this famine in the middle of the Wilderness Elijah is sitting up there and he's communing with God and the Ravens are feeding him and there he is being blessed of God and everybody else is searching for it and it's just being brought to him he didn't even have to do anything it just came to him it's such a beautiful thing and you know what we have we have been given this spiritual spiritual food in due season here it's been given to us it's been laid before us but you know the thing is is and we've got to come to do we really hunger for it and when we actually take part of it I'm so I'm so thankful that what we what we have in this hour and we see that you know as as these take place and and here they here they are they go through this this famine and God is blessing them and give them what they have need of and here she is and it was so amazing this this whole Countryside is is full of people that are that are starving and guess what he finds one Widow he finds this one woman and he comes to her and just just like the the at the pool of Bethesda you know the sick and the lame and the halt there's there's a multitude of people around the pool waiting for the angel to come and here's the one here's the I am that came and created all the angels and he comes and stands before this man and he keeps going there 38 years he stood at the pool trying to get in and Jesus stands there and says well thou be made whole he said Lord I try to get in I try to get in I try to get in one because but he had Faith he never left that pool he was waiting for the troubling of the waters and there he was the one that created the angel that came and stood upon the waters and spoke to him and said take up your bed and walk one because he had faith this one here's a here's this little Woody woman and you know it's not anything that we do why because but it's God's grace to us that God has come and spoke to us and showed us who we are thank you you know as far as as far as human abilities or the things that we would do in this life you know I would I would hate to have to think that I would have to build a a resume as it were you know and stack up against people of the world for God's grace God's mercy to us why because you can always find better people in the world but God chose us it was God's grace to us Glory that God gave us something that he didn't give the others and there's nothing that we've done in ourselves God gave it to us and you know we can't we continue on in this scripture and you know we see Elijah and he's and he's there and and the barrel never runs out and and you know the the little boy gets sick and dies and you know because it was just the widow woman and her son and and you know and then God raises her raises him up and and you know he he continues on through this time and and then and then later on you know uh Elijah goes out and he uh is uh continuing on and and God calls him away from the widow woman and then later on he's out in out in the wilderness and you know all the all the things that that he came through and um you know he comes and he challenges uh Ahab you know because Ahab is destroying Israel and bringing Israel down and you know he come out to rebuke Ahab and and all the things that took place and you know he continues and then he has to go and and deal with uh the prophets of baalem on uh Mount Carmel and you know he just continues on and you know God's taking care of him all through this and and then later on after this you know he leaves and you know he kind of gets run down later on in the story if you read and then you know he comes to a time where he's out by himself and and you know brother talks about how how he's kind of run down and he you know he thinks he's alone and you know he gets into this this period of time where he just sort of moping and you know uh kind of been off to himself and God comes and and sends an angel to him and you know it was in the in this time where he was so low you know he sends an Angel and the angel wakes him up and and and tells him says you know you need to eat and gives it gives him the the bread and the water and he and he eats and he drinks and he goes back to sleep and brother I said an hour or two later the angel wakes him up again and comes to him and says here eat a rise and eat and so he comes and he eats again and the scripture says that he that he went 40 days and and the meat that the angel had fed him he went 40 days in that and you know it's a it's amazing that God comes and gives him what he had need of and even when he was and he thought he was so low and you know it started out in the beginning and it was just it was just the Ravens feeding him and then it was a woman feeding them but when it came to the end then it was an angel the Lord coming and feeding him and giving what he had need of but he gave him what he had need of for the journey and when he was going forth in the in the journey you know he he went from there after after that time then he uh met God in the and the and he was in the cave you know he was hiding from God and God came to him and you know said what is thou doing here Elijah because you know he thought he was all by himself and you know God God told him said no he said you're not you're not by yourself right and you know when you come out there and and God said I want to speak to you and told him to come out to the to the mouth of the cave there and he said I want to speak to you and he come out there and then you know he said he said the wind blew and he said he knew God wasn't in the wind and he said you know an earthquake happened and he said he knew God wasn't in that earthquake he said then he saw a fire and he said he knew he knew God wasn't in that fire but he said when the still Small Voice came by then he wrapped his face and everything and he come out and spoke to God and God God spoke to him and told him he said Elijah he said I want you to know something he said you're not by yourself just to pass on another point before I forget uh you know I was reading and you know hey the scripture tells us that that Elijah went to the went to Horeb and it if you if you don't know if you if you study Mal uh Horeb is is also known as Mount Sinai you know Mount Sinai was where where God gave opposes the Ten Commandments brought him up on the mountain and gave gave him the the word and you know told him the the things and made himself known unto Moses and he done the same thing we're here with Elijah and he brings him up on the mountain and he tells him he said listen he said you're not alone he said there are seven thousand that have not bowed their knee to Baal he said they kissed him but he said I want you to know something he said I've got something for you to do he said he said I want you to do something he said when you leave here he said you go down and he said you find uh Isaiah and I think he was supposed to be anointed king over Judah and then Jay Hugh was supposed to be the anointed king over Israel and they told him he said then you he said then you'll find Elisha he said you'll know in Elisha and he said he'll be prophet in thy room because he was already laying up the next next Prophet you know was calling him up but uh you know he went he went forth to do those things in the scriptures tells him says uh he said the ones the ones that bypass hasiel said that that jehugh will slay and he said those that passed jehu Elisha will slay and so he come to find out you know that and all of this he wasn't by himself but God had had a word for him to do and as he went along God was opening things up to him and it was continually to feed him and it was and and all of these type things because it was secret it was something special to Elijah that God was showing him something that he was giving him what he had need of that he could walk in this journey and then when he walked in that for 40 days he he had nothing but that bread and that water and it was so amazing that God had brought him through all this and gave him that little bit and so you know and the way we are today God has given us these little this little bit and it's a it's just you know it's a little bit here and a little bit there but it's what God has given us that little bit and you know it's so amazing that what God has given us in this day you know it takes God to open these things up to us if it's not God you know because you can look at many things but it takes God and And he as the scripture says the secret things so they're secret things that are made known and you know brother Branham goes on to talk about uh in in the scripture and later on he uh he talks about the uh silence in heaven right hey you know because he said because it was a secret thing that was being made known he said that's the reason there was silence in heaven but God was making these things known and you know we we see how God has had came to make these things known and you know there was a few things that just kind of stood out to me and and one of them was uh I was listening to brother Brandon the other night and you know he was uh speaking of brother Bosworth and brother Bosworth was wanting to answer Dr Bass you know Dr Bess was the one that was against the Divine Healing and was told it was telling them that you know you know this is all just a bunch of baloney and you know there's no scriptural thing and you know they won't debate us because you know they they know it's not scriptural and they got nothing no place to stand and you know it's it's these little things that just stand out to you and you're you know brother Brandon wouldn't let brother Bosworth uh argue with him but he said you know I promise I'm not going to argue with him but he said I want to answer you know brother Brian said that it was like Caleb going up there to take his Mountain he wanted to answer what he had to say and you know when he walked on that platform that night and it was it's such an amazing thing you know he walked up there and he asked Dr best he said Dr best let me ask you one question he said well and and he said just answer this one question he said if you answer this one he said I can sit down and Dr Bay said I'm not going to answer it you know he said just go and do your thing and that was when he walked up there and he asked him he said was the Redemptive names of Jehovah applied to Jesus Christ yes or no and it struck me brother Branham said he said I never even thought of that he said that was something I never thought of until Kayla until he got up and you know brother Bosworth said that and you know somebody that Caleb taking that mountain he said man that just struck me that he's like man he said he's got him right there and you know he said because you know he said unless you he said I never thought unless you see it that way and so you know and and then the the other story that that comes to mind when when brother Brown was speaking of that and have you see things and God's speaking to you and breaking things down was uh when he was squirrel hunting and he went to go see the Infidel and he was up there speaking to the Infidel that time and you know the Infidel was uh talking about you know he said I've never seen God he said there's no such thing as God he said I've been on this mountain 40 years you know raise up on the hill there all this stuff and he said never seen God nobody's ever proved me of God he said y'all a bunch of lying dogs and you know all that kind of stuff everything that he said about brother Branham and uh preachers and everything like that you know brother Ram got up there picked that Apple up was talking to him he said boy it's a good apple yeah he planted I planted that tree and got to talking to him about nature and he told him he said he said now what is it he said this tree's losing his sleeves he said we've had his cold snap or nothing he said it's August I mean or September you know he's not gotten cold he said why are they leaving this loose leaves he said oh well that's nature why why is nature causing this to take place and there's no need I mean there's no reason for it to take place well that's just nature what is causing that what is something is governing that life in that tree you know brother Brown said it had to be something that was guiding it because he you know because he asked him said why is that he said well he'd kill the tree if it didn't go down in The Roots and then he said he'd come back he said well good he said we can just take a bucket of water put on this pole out here this Vince posted all the water will run down to the bottom of it next spring it'll come back to the top he said well no there's no life in that so there has to be something there that governs that there has to be a principle there has to be a law of God for that to work and he told that he told that Infidel he said he said if you can answer me what life what intelligence told that water to go that life to go down in the root of that tree and come back the next week or the next year he said I'll tell you the same intelligence that told me that that woman that was up on the hill that was dying with cancer that if she'd believe the Commandments of God she'd be healed and Infidel he said he said I never thought of it like that why because he had heard so much and he had seen something but something had to strike him that his side could say something and when he saw it he said I never saw it like that right and when he saw that he said unto that apple tree he said I led him to Christ what was it because when you see something see it it takes the things the secret things belong to God but the things that are revealed belong to you and I and see that's what he's working at through these things that he is trying to break it down to you and I can see them you see everybody don't see everything the same way but you know what we'll see the same Revelation but he has to reach each one of us individually because there are certain things that I see that you won't see the same way right you know I I don't know I've probably told this story before and you know somebody some of you this this won't mean anything but it meant something to me all right listen I listened to professor at mathematics one time give a lecture on number Theory and I've already lost some of you right there but anyway he was speaking a number of sets and how numbers you know he said there was only one he said take the number six he said there's only one number six but he said you can put that number six in all kind of different subsets because it still is number six he said you don't ever change it he said you can put in anything you want to it works out he said you can actually change it to other things but it never changes what it is you can write it as 12 you know 12 over 2 or whatever you know the square root of 36 however you want to write it denoted it's still the same number and when he got done with that I want to jump up and say why don't y'all see one God I was like y'all can't say that I mean he he was he was always God all he done was change his form he became he was still God he was he was Elohim in the beginning and all he done was change his mask he became the he he changed to become the son but that didn't change who he was he manifested himself in a different way I want to get up and run the owls yeah oh praise the Lord y'all can't see that but I know most of y'all probably would have sat there and y'all would have probably just zoned down it's like uh but it struck me I was like my goodness I mean it was almost like Rapture I was like wow that's great but you know what it would have meant no it may not have meant anything else to y'all but it spoke to me why because God speaks and he said he said the numerology of the Bible numeratics of the Bible are perfect and everything that God does in the creation everything is perfect it all speaks of God it's just beautiful that God made these things known to us that he has revealed himself so I just want to read a few quotes here and then I'm gonna I'm gonna quit I didn't have a whole lot tonight but you know sometimes you don't know which way you want to go but you know what you want to say now this is from this is from so I'm going to read this few quotes here but uh this is from the world's falling apart it's number 14 Brothers and he says there's only one thing that that never did begin that was God therefore the only way we can live Eternal is to have God's own life in us and that's eternal life you say God is the word in the beginning was the word words with God and the Word was God it's still God that's right it's still it is the word and when we get away from the word they're away from God Jesus said if you abide in me he said there's the mystery there's the secret if you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will see the idea is first God's word has got to abide here you can't take creaturisms or anything so forth amen so and then we're going on to number 15. I think this was ill yeah see here it is so God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a Moon Star at a molecule or anything he was God and he wasn't he wasn't he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object to worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and him was love and him to be father and him was to be son and him was to be Savior and him was to be healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God and just scrolling up so I just got different ones here to read he said God's great mystery say Sorry God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then you see oh I believe what is being done that God's great mystery of hell it's a secret he can't put a secret nobody know nothing about it even angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under the seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence right then he continues on notice God has had a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he had a three-fold purpose in it and he said what we want to go on this morning to see what the threefold purpose and then continuing on 29 there says Heavenly places oh I wish I had time here I've got it marked here in my Bible about Heavenly places what is Heavenly places just for a moment it's a believer's position in Christ where the police are where the believer stands in Christ in Heavenly places according to as he hath chosen us listen close chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when his great hidden Mystery his great secret he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world and then continuing on he says predestination he said there's the mystery before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see this great mystery that he chose the bride knowing evil would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they were predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand and then continuing on he says now you see the secret what to to restore Fallen Eve she was a free figure of the church and now notice as God opened up the side of Adam and took out Eve out of his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit with from masculine defendant to feminish and put it in eve took the rib from under his side and made Eve out of it so God did the same thing taking out of the sight of Christ the blood and the water and Christ is the Lord and taking the word and making up his church Eve see back to himself again Redeemed by the blood that was come from his body you see now God's great mystery being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured and all the way down through and he continues on says all those things typed him see just in type but yet the mystery was he had right then man didn't know what they were doing the only thing was that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days for the great Revelation but expressing it expressed himself to Moses and David and Joseph and Elijah on down through you see each one of them prophets and bring their live out and show it expressed Jesus Christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret in full waiting for it to be made known in the last days as he promised waiting it waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it and if he told the the whole thing before the Bible is written in mystery Jesus thanked the father for see it was written in Mysteries and then you just come on down and he says scroll down a little bit there brother didn't come back in the last days to pick up these Mysteries and clearly explain it reveal see why it's all the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed amen and then I have just one more quote I want to read right quick and uh and I'll I'll let you know where this one's at number 10 brother if you can find brother and number 10 spiritual food in D season real quick brother Brown says here in in spiritual spiritual food and due season number 10 says we notice here again if the world is in us if the word is in us and has come to us as it did in Elijah in that day it'll do the same thing that he did he would feed on the secret things of God which is hid from the world oh again it makes the message and the messenger as one the spiritual food is ready and it's in the season now amen I can't detain you Zone says and each one of you can have this food if you wish if you're willing to steal away from all the unbelief of the hour if you're ready to come into Christ come into his promise and continues and he gives the scriptures for all the different Promises of God he says if you can hide away in that in that secret place you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of God if you're sick there's healing there amen God bless you tonight that's all I had just wanted to share what was on my heart
