[0:00] yeah
[0:02] there's be here this morning good to
[0:07] good to have both sister Daniella with
[0:10] us
[0:11] I said brother Matthew yeah but if you
[0:20] saying you you've not seen Matthew bless
[0:22] your hearts nothing all right we're all
[0:27] Hebrews he's got that Hebrews 11 and our
[0:34] Hebrew series we got to Hebrews 11 24
[0:39] last week we were talking about my faith
[0:43] Joseph when he died didn't want to leave
[0:47] his bones and either he wanted them take
[0:51] them to Israel but he knew that's where
[0:54] the resurrection on them and we were
[0:56] talking about the journey of faith
[1:00] because faith is the substance of things
[1:03] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:05] seen
[1:06] because you don't have to have faith
[1:09] that you're going to get to church this
[1:10] morning you're here your faith was when
[1:14] you got in the car or got started
[1:17] getting ready or some of us that are
[1:19] older just getting up
[1:23] and the deans and the yellow light come
[1:26] on and the dashboard the yellow light
[1:29] insanely okay all right so by faith each
[1:41] person there was a faith journey and
[1:44] there's a faith journey that you listen
[1:46] we're don't know how we're gonna need
[1:48] faith after a body Jani
[1:49] when we need faith for and Jesus walked
[1:54] in a world of perfect faith if he don't
[1:57] have enough faith he already knew he
[1:58] didn't have to faith he was gonna rain
[2:00] glabrous he just knew who he was because
[2:02] what God had done showed you my vision
[2:04] four days early and I see that's where
[2:06] you can have confidence when you see
[2:08] something we'll see we say well I think
[2:10] you say well I've never seen a vision I
[2:12] think about this other day I've never
[2:14] seen a vision but this word of God is to
[2:16] be this is what we've got this is what
[2:20] we've got to see is that the Word of God
[2:21] in the vision is the vision God had
[2:24] before the foundation of the world and
[2:26] now you and I are what fulfilling the
[2:29] vision well what's our part full veiled
[2:31] and we were talking about last night
[2:35] what's that vision it's fulfil for the
[2:37] Gentiles God moved to the Jews and then
[2:40] from the Jews we go into the Millennium
[2:41] together well it's still partial
[2:44] revelation partial vision for others but
[2:48] now for me and you when we take a
[2:49] rapture we've already we're no more we
[2:53] don't need Redemption anymore an infant
[2:55] over I mean what more is your guy do you
[2:58] have a lot of change but still the
[3:00] world's gotta catch up to us though
[3:02] the world's not totally
[3:04] 144,000 have to be redeemed v fields you
[3:09] all those different ones have to be
[3:11] redeemed and then in Millennium there's
[3:13] a little time of rest a thousand years
[3:15] where we all rest alright then you got
[3:18] to watch going judgment which redemption
[3:20] is continuing into the white throne
[3:21] judgment because they will be redemption
[3:23] given to people blueish virgin couple
[3:26] water my name and all those different
[3:27] one their journey will end when they get
[3:31] into the future home because brother
[3:32] rounds at time will blend into eternity
[3:34] so time is going to actually continue on
[3:36] to until the future home but remember
[3:40] the millennium is in your seventh day
[3:42] it's not an eighth day manifestation
[3:44] it's still in what we would call time or
[3:48] the seventh Church age number seven
[3:50] churches ends because of the Gentiles it
[3:52] ends for us when we go in after don't
[3:55] worry about that but time continue dawn
[3:58] if somebody's going to literally live
[4:01] 1,000 years to prove the sin curse has
[4:04] been done away with so there's going to
[4:05] be 24 hours but remember this is just my
[4:10] thought it's not going to be 365 on the
[4:12] fork we're not gonna have week years in
[4:14] the Millennium no it goes back to 360
[4:17] days that's what you have to count
[4:18] everything as is your calendar of 360
[4:21] days as the world comes back up because
[4:24] remember the way the world was knocked
[4:27] out of kilter was to play bad and
[4:31] brother Graham said you know could be an
[4:33] atomic explosion because man is always
[4:35] destroyed himself well what if the
[4:37] Battle of Armageddon is going to be
[4:39] where it reverses it back standing back
[4:41] devil because we're going to be under
[4:43] 360 day year from then on okay the
[4:47] prophets are going to prophesy 1260 days
[4:49] there's no calendar that they're going
[4:51] to go live for 1260 days it's going to
[4:54] be 30 days two months twelve hundred and
[4:57] 60 consecutive days but we have faith
[5:01] for that
[5:02] we don't have to we don't have to I
[5:06] guess man has went crazy said well I
[5:10] gotta have faith for this and have faith
[5:12] for that there has to come a time where
[5:15] you have an assured II it says by faith
[5:18] in other words are three faith through
[5:22] faith is a journey you go through faith
[5:23] because remember what happened right
[5:25] here by faith by faith by faith by faith
[5:27] by faith and you get to these died in
[5:33] faith even Sarah went through faith
[5:36] through faith not by faith through faith
[5:39] all right Sarah which is time to the
[5:42] bride a comfortable woman a so by faith
[5:47] Moses when he was born within three
[5:49] months of his family because he started
[5:51] the proper childhood they were not
[5:52] afraid of the Kings commandment by faith
[5:54] Moses when he was come to years refused
[5:57] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[5:59] daughter as we were talking last night
[6:03] with the youth mother did mother have a
[6:09] lot to do with his journey because she
[6:13] kept telling him you're not the son of
[6:15] Pharaoh's daughter you're born to be a
[6:17] leader you're born to be this so she by
[6:20] her connection to Moses he gave him a
[6:28] chance or an opportunity and then and
[6:30] then Moses wrote a third of the Old
[6:35] Testament
[6:36] and for surety Moses one of the greatest
[6:39] prophets that ever lived
[6:40] she wants to bring this to a point then
[6:42] you go over in the New Testament are the
[6:44] the book of Matthew in there where
[6:46] parodia raised her daughter and she told
[6:51] her to go dance in front of the in front
[6:54] of Herod and I don't believe it was just
[6:57] a Texas two-step it was something very
[7:02] sensual and BC what a main so what that
[7:05] caused was though it's for Herod to cut
[7:07] the head off of John the Baptist well
[7:09] now that woman raised her daughter
[7:11] go to hell this woman raised her son to
[7:17] be a great prophet that's what I was
[7:19] talking about last night so message
[7:20] message parents we do the best we can
[7:22] but you really need to the Bible says
[7:25] when they're older they'll not depart
[7:26] from it right so you instill these
[7:30] things in them when they're young by
[7:33] faith Moses when he was come to years
[7:35] refused to be called the son of
[7:37] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[7:40] suffer affliction with the people of God
[7:41] and to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[7:44] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[7:47] greater riches than the treasures needed
[7:49] for he had respect unto the recompense
[7:51] of the reward the wall is his reward his
[7:55] reward and he could have stayed in each
[7:57] of them indicating been the Pharaoh he
[8:00] was in line he could do that I mean but
[8:02] it would have been a temporal thing it
[8:04] was been for a season and I'm sure Moses
[8:06] looks and sees all these pharaohs and
[8:08] everybody's trying to kill Pharaoh I
[8:10] mean you know you've got all the people
[8:11] around him in and they don't last very
[8:13] long sometimes unless they go unless
[8:16] they kill everybody all their people
[8:17] around him so today he figured that that
[8:22] he'd rather just stay in to what he was
[8:25] in that mother told him you're going to
[8:26] be a leader you're gonna be the one to
[8:28] do this you're gonna be the one going to
[8:30] take you out with a mighty hand by faith
[8:32] he forsook what the world did not
[8:35] fearing the wrath of the King for he
[8:39] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[8:42] now watch through faith he kept the
[8:46] Passover the sprinkling the blood less
[8:48] than he destroyed the first that blessed
[8:50] that heat that destroyed the firstborn
[8:52] should touch them so terrific he had to
[8:56] believe what God said go kill the lamb
[8:59] everybody get inside put ain't baby girl
[9:04] hey put the blood on the doorpost
[9:11] and see you have to believe that but
[9:12] what you do is you believe for that
[9:14] manifestation because the manifestation
[9:17] was they heard the cry of all the
[9:20] firstborn in Egypt all the cattle and
[9:22] all everything that went covered under
[9:24] the blood died so Moses through faith he
[9:28] kept the Passover the sprinkling blood
[9:30] lest he that destroyed the firstborn
[9:32] should touch them by faith that passed
[9:35] through the Red Sea and by dry land now
[9:38] look I want you to see something here by
[9:44] faith they passed through the Red Sea
[9:46] and by dry land now who's they that's
[9:48] the whole of Israel but now reach Philo
[9:56] they come up to the Red Sea they turn
[10:00] around to Moses and saying why have you
[10:02] brought us out here tonight someone had
[10:06] to come on the scene that had faith
[10:09] remember brother Browns preachers wanna
[10:12] cry speak write because Moses began to
[10:15] cry all right there's this really in
[10:19] faith there's no crying you need to
[10:22] speak and go forward by faith because
[10:24] faith is the substance of things hoped
[10:26] for the evidence of things not seen so
[10:30] the evidence was that they got across
[10:32] the Red Sea on dry land the faith they
[10:35] had they had in Moses and Moses put his
[10:40] a shirt in what God already said that's
[10:43] what he said back up here Moses right
[10:46] here he forsook Egypt not fearing the
[10:50] wrath of the King for he endured as
[10:52] seeing him who is invisible through
[10:56] faith he kept the Passover he was he was
[10:58] going to lead the people out same way
[11:00] with them
[11:01] the children of Israel were Jewish just
[11:06] like meeting you we murmur and complain
[11:08] we come up against the wall and what's
[11:10] the first thing
[11:11] the crowd and dog why understand me in
[11:13] this direction why you know what who are
[11:17] we to tell a creator this is the wrong
[11:19] way but remember God's no nor the best
[11:23] yes is you'll ever get all right
[11:32] 20 wait 20 said seeing him
[11:41] hey hey that pain didn't have time faith
[11:43] if the man was standing in front of me
[11:47] he had faint listen these people had
[11:50] faith that's why they're called the this
[11:54] the faith chapter is listening you and I
[11:57] have seen God move through a prophet
[12:00] we've seen the Word of God we've seen
[12:01] moving on life Moses and Abraham just
[12:08] heard somebody talking to it they heard
[12:12] somebody talking bill now how many times
[12:14] has somebody talked to you and I'll be
[12:18] good a thousand a day but then you come
[12:25] up to one person Abraham ins Abraham
[12:27] sitting in his recliner and you know he
[12:29] feeling pretty good and all of a sudden
[12:30] he hears this voice it says get up move
[12:36] and he does why because he chose the
[12:40] right one same way with Moses he never
[12:42] saw he never saw God until they were in
[12:45] their journey remember he remember he
[12:46] saw the backside of the man I want to
[12:48] see you wailed down here packed into
[12:50] journey it's when he really saw God so
[12:53] he was believing God never show this
[12:57] stuff to composes at this point in time
[13:02] he showed him to him in the journey he
[13:05] showed his stuff in the journey but
[13:07] Moses believed so much in what remember
[13:09] let's go back to what his mother his
[13:10] mother taught him to believe in the
[13:16] invisible and that's the same way with
[13:18] you and I we should teach their kids to
[13:20] believe in the supernatural supernatural
[13:21] invisible right right so as seeing him
[13:25] who is invisible become what God Christ
[13:28] whatever you want Christ through the Old
[13:29] Testament Joba that was who he's talking
[13:32] about
[13:35] my fate they pass through the Red Sea is
[13:37] my growl in which the Egyptians are
[13:39] saved to do
[13:40] we're ground by faith the walls of
[13:43] Jericho fell after they will compassed
[13:45] about seven days and then we have to
[13:48] include right here by faith Rahab the
[13:50] harlot perished not with them that
[13:53] believed not when she received the spies
[13:56] with peace now then you go back to what
[14:00] I was talking about the other day what a
[14:03] great show of sanctification Rahab was
[14:09] not pure woman by no means she was she
[14:14] was well known in the community in all
[14:16] of Jericho I'm certain now why God
[14:19] picked her because she had faith she was
[14:21] part of the thing she believed the two
[14:25] spies come in and they said okay if
[14:28] you'll stay right here run the red rope
[14:29] down because you have helped us escape
[14:33] we'll give you you know Whittle in other
[14:36] words we'll let you live of course it
[14:39] was the plan had gone all the way long
[14:41] because Here I am you got Rahab marries
[14:43] an Israeli general who had though they
[14:44] had to that guest he who has Damon
[14:46] so really whose lineage come through
[14:49] that prosecuting campaign which in the
[14:51] water really good winnings comes through
[14:53] this prostitute because that's what we
[14:54] were we were all robbing hips
[14:56] we were prostitutes to drinking and
[14:59] smoking and cussing and gamblin and all
[15:01] the other things that's what we were
[15:02] prosecutor daddy but by faith the harlot
[15:05] Rahab perished not within the believe
[15:08] not when she had received the spies with
[15:11] peace and then it stops
[15:15] and then they put a bunch of them
[15:17] together and what shall I more say for
[15:19] the time when fail me to tell of gideon
[15:20] barak samson objected on David Samuel
[15:25] and of the prophets who through faith
[15:28] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[15:30] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[15:33] lions quenched the violence of fire
[15:35] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[15:37] weakness were made strong that
[15:39] get in waxed valiant in fight turned to
[15:42] flight the armies of the aliens I was
[15:46] reading and neither can't they it was
[15:52] second Kings where the army was
[15:56] outnumbered like 25 to 30 the woman and
[16:01] whoever the problem was at the time I
[16:03] can't really remember the King comes to
[16:06] him and says what are we going to do
[16:07] and prophet said well let me go talk to
[16:09] God in other words I'll go see what's
[16:11] going on
[16:12] he said I'll don't worry he's going into
[16:15] battle said the battle juror you win the
[16:17] battle when I baby let me tell you that
[16:21] be hard to get to the end infant
[16:23] treatment it went so hard to get into
[16:27] the general or the one or the King to
[16:29] under to a snit but when you go down and
[16:31] tell your army of 300 that there's 3,000
[16:35] men down here in this field and you're
[16:38] going to destroy every one of them you
[16:39] really have to complain that you want
[16:42] why am I saying that because it's like
[16:44] we talked about the fivefold ministry
[16:47] the fivefold ministry has to get the
[16:49] revelation first and then we have to
[16:51] convey it to you that you don't don't
[16:53] have faith in us you have faith in what
[16:54] we stay you know faith and what said if
[16:58] we bring you the Word of God you have
[16:59] faith in the Word of God but we were
[17:01] talking about that was not about brother
[17:03] Branham you know he said he said you
[17:05] know he said when he was talking about
[17:07] them the race war where you know they
[17:11] died like flies and debt is going being
[17:12] come he said that one he said now what
[17:14] does that the Lord that was me he said
[17:17] you got a watch you got to be careful
[17:18] and watching a lot of things that even
[17:20] prophets say they just be careful of it
[17:22] a lot of it is human human thoughts but
[17:25] when they bring you the Word of God face
[17:28] final resting places then this word
[17:30] you can take it back to this work of God
[17:32] you can be a sure or have faith that
[17:34] remember a prophet is a divine revealer
[17:39] of the word now he doesn't reveal it to
[17:41] you he came from Billington but he makes
[17:43] it so plain and simple to wear that
[17:46] childlike simple faith reacts back and
[17:50] says they ain't nothing but the truth
[17:52] just like hey derived it Dino that's
[17:54] true and you have to say that when you
[17:56] do that God has to honor that but you
[17:57] bring it together right because what
[18:00] happened is God can't honor falsework
[18:04] he can't honor anything false he has to
[18:07] honor his word cyber arrested called
[18:09] caught on the scene all right call
[18:11] caught on the same telling you did
[18:13] everything you're supposed to do and if
[18:15] you don't do what you what he's supposed
[18:16] to do you can call him a liar now that's
[18:18] pretty strong but you better make sure
[18:20] you do everything he thinks you're
[18:22] supposed to right down the line right
[18:25] because you get in trouble - God doesn't
[18:27] then women received their dead raised to
[18:30] life again and others were tortured not
[18:32] accepting deliverance thinking I'm
[18:34] trying to think back again well there
[18:36] was one battle there was I can't
[18:40] remember there was like ten thousand men
[18:42] in this one battle and they were the
[18:45] enemy and there was a child ends I think
[18:47] then they came up cuz I'm reading
[18:48] Jeremiah
[18:49] they came up to battle Judah to not do
[18:53] to himself but Jude and Kingdom and God
[18:58] told whoever lusts and does the Jeremiah
[19:00] I guess in Tulsa don't worry don't worry
[19:03] the battles yours don't worry about it
[19:04] they get up the next morning and God has
[19:08] sent the death angel to count killed
[19:10] everyone killed a whole army up the
[19:12] whole enemy they're just laying up their
[19:13] data all right and you got to help and
[19:17] says don't get the spoil over the land
[19:18] and get all this stuff you know because
[19:20] the gods come too and he just killed
[19:22] everyone up that's kind of God
[19:25] never have full solar women received
[19:28] their dead raised to live the end others
[19:30] were tortured not accepting deliverance
[19:31] that they might obtain a better
[19:32] resurrection and the others had triumph
[19:35] of cruel walking scourging yeah moreover
[19:37] of bonds and imprisonment they were
[19:40] stoned they were sawn asunder remember
[19:42] Isaiah they cut him in pieces tempted
[19:47] were slain with the story they wondered
[19:48] about sheepskin goat skin being
[19:50] destitute afflicted tormented hello I
[19:53] love what Paul interpolates Paul
[19:57] interpolates here with the parenthesis
[19:59] of whom the world was not worthy the
[20:01] world wasn't worthy for them people they
[20:03] only even though they are the Great Hall
[20:05] of faith leaders this world what need
[20:09] worthy for them to do what they did but
[20:12] they were put in here for what our
[20:14] example they wandered in deserts and in
[20:16] mountains and in dens in case of the
[20:18] earth now look here's the whole point
[20:20] and these all having obtained a good
[20:23] report or testimony through faith
[20:31] received not the promise what's the
[20:34] promise
[20:36] thanks to 38
[20:40] right does the promise is to your
[20:44] children
[20:45] right the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[20:47] never receive the promise listen when
[20:51] God when God speed and genesis 3:15 his
[20:53] promise was I'm going to sin I'm going
[20:57] to send myself and I'm going to be the
[21:00] state of the woman and I'm gonna make
[21:02] this thing come right back together
[21:03] that's a promise but not just the
[21:06] comments Jehovah and like you said you
[21:08] know that he thought you gotta fought
[21:09] their army or any their battle
[21:11] sometimes too and God will fight yours
[21:13] if you let him but they still some you
[21:15] got five right fit because they obtained
[21:18] to do report through faith received not
[21:20] the promise the promise was is that
[21:22] you've got Adam and Eve standing here
[21:24] and they fell and God wanted to give
[21:27] eternal life to everybody
[21:29] bring the bride forth and bring them the
[21:32] ones that were that works of now eternal
[21:35] life in their soul there's no way they
[21:36] could do that in the Old Testament not
[21:40] happening so what was the promise the
[21:44] promise is I'll be with you even in you
[21:47] to the end of the world that's what God
[21:50] won't he don't want to live with us
[21:51] it's okay did he was dead he lives with
[21:54] us he lived with the children of Israel
[21:56] but he always wanted to well inside of
[21:58] them
[22:00] he always wanted well end people not
[22:02] just with people so they never received
[22:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost of their
[22:08] soul sure they're going to be back
[22:10] they're going to be eternal sure they're
[22:11] gonna be be there but you know what
[22:14] they're not right
[22:16] I read you in Jeremiah last 90 babe
[22:19] they lost their bride ship dog had to
[22:21] put them away go but I had to put them
[22:23] away for what they did but he can't
[22:26] restore them back to wipe again because
[22:28] the grounds polluted we read that
[22:31] remember the grounds polluted you can't
[22:33] take the wife back after she's been
[22:35] polluted but it doesn't mean you have to
[22:37] kill her either no he made some he
[22:40] brings another forty
[22:41] one thousand then he's going to bring
[22:42] all these Old Testament Saints and you
[22:45] know what to be truthful they're not
[22:47] gonna get to live in the city that would
[22:49] come like that last night about who
[22:50] lived in the city and who lives outside
[22:52] the city they're going to live outside
[22:53] the city only in the bride and the
[22:59] 144,000 living inside of that city now
[23:03] they're not included in them even the
[23:07] great Moses
[23:08] I'm sure you've got your you've got your
[23:10] Twelve Apostles in your 12 patriarchs
[23:13] but there's nowhere that they get what
[23:17] we get and they've lost that position
[23:20] but don't talk so much it's just one
[23:22] this is the hall of faith
[23:23] listen we should have way more surety
[23:28] than they did we've been taught we've
[23:32] got Bible we've got message books we've
[23:35] got all this different information
[23:36] Abraham was just sitting down one day
[23:39] and his recliner like I said working for
[23:41] his father-in-law making idols and
[23:43] making a good living and all of a sudden
[23:45] somebody said says hey bro you need to
[23:50] come and go in a different direction you
[23:51] need to give up and follow me
[23:54] how many times the left minute old here
[23:57] you know many times you say well what do
[23:59] you mean and he had nothing to check it
[24:02] with they've been they have nothing to
[24:05] check it with in everything do you have
[24:08] nothing even have nothing Moses Moses
[24:11] had his mama
[24:14] his mama doctor his mama was telling him
[24:16] hey we're gonna do this we're going to
[24:18] do that right but now you and I'm
[24:23] brother Brown says many times he said he
[24:27] said we live way more privileges why
[24:30] because you see the great miracles that
[24:31] happen in the Old Testament under the
[24:34] blood of bulls and goats done anointing
[24:36] people but now he's not an anointing
[24:39] people today if you're born again you
[24:41] are the anointing yeah you are the
[24:44] promised
[24:45] why says God having provided some better
[24:48] thing for us that they without us should
[24:55] not be made perfect
[24:57] now as I've Illustrated many times
[25:00] before as Paul is speaking this they
[25:07] were these people back here Paul was
[25:09] standing here in the New Testament just
[25:13] started during Paul's time you know you
[25:16] test them at what noon when Jesus was
[25:17] here if when Paul and Peter when the
[25:20] Holy Ghost fell on their Pentecost acts
[25:22] when to Turkey's church they started
[25:24] back when that's when the New Testament
[25:26] started Friday he's standing there
[25:28] though saying better thing for us that
[25:31] day he looks back all the way back to
[25:35] Adam they without us cannot be made
[25:36] perfect when I when Paul got his head
[25:41] chopped off he became a leg
[25:45] he's not at us anymore these are they so
[25:49] now we're standing over here at the end
[25:51] of the church age is looking back to
[25:53] Paul through Paul back to Adam and
[25:56] they're waiting on us because they
[25:59] without us should not be made perfect
[26:01] but this us is going to end it all
[26:03] there's not another one coming it's
[26:05] gonna be perfect it's just gonna be us
[26:07] so that us
[26:09] Paul was prophesied but until he died he
[26:17] wasn't us he was living the he was
[26:20] living the promise by having some better
[26:25] thing for us that they without us should
[26:29] not be made perfect or apart from we
[26:33] will read that and then perfect I think
[26:35] that means complete yes because there
[26:39] was no completion in Paul's day you
[26:42] still have you still had your sure it in
[26:46] the soul he was born again no doubt but
[26:50] he didn't have he was actually the seals
[26:54] what he didn't know what to seal was
[26:56] remember I told you all the other day
[26:58] and it kind of shocked him Paul was
[27:00] already dead he never knew that John
[27:02] went to Patmos
[27:03] your honor went that was in the night in
[27:05] the 1890's wall was killed in maybe 15
[27:09] 66 Paul never heard of a seal when he
[27:13] preached all about it by revelation he
[27:16] didn't know what to call it so he
[27:18] preached but he didn't know what still
[27:21] one was still to us feel free well he's
[27:24] already gone even dead nor it in another
[27:25] dimension but who that for though that
[27:29] was for us to see it John topped the
[27:34] bride and if we now watch remember
[27:40] chapters are put in by man not by God
[27:45] this is the letter to the Hebrews Paul
[27:47] is writing a letter to the Hebrews hmm
[27:49] watch his last off dot having provided
[27:51] some better thing for us that they
[27:53] without us you
[27:53] we made perfect don't lose you talk
[27:55] because he keeps writing we're for
[28:00] seeing that we also are compassed about
[28:03] with so great a cloud of witnesses let
[28:06] us cannot leave in perfect let us lay
[28:10] aside every weight and the sin which
[28:11] doth so easily beset us and let us run
[28:15] with patience the race that is set
[28:16] before us looking unto Jesus not looking
[28:19] back to them to the to the once goes
[28:22] right here's where the promise came from
[28:24] the promise didn't come from the Old
[28:25] Testament the problem did come from
[28:26] baracan and David and all the promise
[28:29] came from Jesus Christ Nepal is bringing
[28:32] an updated revelation that we gotta look
[28:35] into Jesus the author and finisher of
[28:37] our faith who for the joy that was set
[28:40] before him endured the cross despising
[28:42] the shame and is set down at the right
[28:45] hand of the throne of God the words of
[28:48] throne of God now on heaven than you
[28:50] right
[28:52] for consider him that endured such
[28:55] contradiction of sinners against himself
[28:58] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[29:02] minds for consider him that endured such
[29:05] contradiction Jesus Christ of sinners
[29:08] against him lest ye be wearied and faint
[29:10] in your mind another words don't worry
[29:12] about what these people are saying you
[29:15] have not yet resisted unto blood
[29:16] striving against sin and he have
[29:20] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[29:22] unto you as unto children my son is five
[29:26] knock down the chastisement of the Lord
[29:27] nor faint when they are they are rebuked
[29:30] of him for whom the Lord loveth he
[29:33] chasing the point is competent this
[29:34] whole dissertation is for this one for
[29:37] this one burst from them the Lord loveth
[29:40] he chastens and scourges every son and
[29:43] me receive us like I said yesterday you
[29:46] can't have a testimony without having a
[29:48] test first got how the test the first
[29:50] four letters of testimony or tdst there
[29:53] you got out there before
[29:55] all right they don't forget all these
[30:00] people in the Old Testament the Paul
[30:03] brands that revelation up to Jesus
[30:05] endured such contradiction you need to
[30:08] endure such contradiction and you have
[30:14] not yet resisted unto blood in other
[30:16] words you guys hadn't died for what you
[30:18] believed in
[30:18] yeah now he knew he was maybe later on
[30:21] but he probably didn't when he was right
[30:23] deep breath striving against sin and you
[30:25] have forgotten the exhortation which
[30:27] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[30:30] son despise not down to chastisement
[30:32] texting of the Lord nor faint when they
[30:35] art rebuke to him for whom the Lord
[30:38] loveth he chasing it go Maggie was
[30:41] telling them story about something that
[30:44] he had done in and the Lord led him out
[30:47] for about three weeks over something and
[30:48] and then he brought him the revelation
[30:51] of what was going on well you know I
[30:53] said well brother Matthew I said he
[30:56] wasn't done that if you weren't a child
[30:59] they want they've done that they
[31:02] wouldn't went after you and lets you
[31:04] steal over it for a few weeks and then
[31:07] brand-new revelation and then know that
[31:09] you won't use it he brought that so you
[31:11] can use it I ain't David for a testimony
[31:15] if you endure chastening God dealeth
[31:18] with you as with sons for what son is he
[31:21] whom the father chasing them not but if
[31:24] you be without chastisement where for
[31:27] all are partakers then are ye bastards
[31:29] if not sunk free hard words there Paul
[31:34] illegitimate
[31:38] you and you know what that's the truth
[31:42] if you're not a son of God you're really
[31:45] gentlemen you there's a lot of
[31:49] illegitimate Christians out there they
[31:50] they're not sons and daughters of God
[31:52] they just try to stay in the family
[31:55] because remember an illegitimate child
[31:57] is part of the family
[31:58] somebody's somewhere there's a genetic
[32:02] connection between an illegitimate child
[32:04] they just weren't born in the right way
[32:06] that same way with the born-again work
[32:08] if you're not born again the right way
[32:10] but remember brother Graham says this
[32:12] Brides brides churches Brides but
[32:15] there's gonna come one and we are
[32:17] standing in the one which will be sons
[32:19] and daughters we've done furthermore we
[32:23] have had fathers of our flesh which
[32:25] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[32:28] shall we not much rather be in
[32:30] subjection unto the father of spirits
[32:32] and live in other words the heavenly
[32:33] father for they barely for a few days
[32:36] chastened us after their own pleasure
[32:38] but he for our profit that we might be
[32:42] protective of : is just what I said the
[32:45] chastisement is a test and the test is
[32:47] what we have to go through that we can
[32:49] come back and tell others you know they
[32:53] go do the same thing now no chastening
[32:57] for the present seemeth to be joyous
[32:59] there is no time you go through a test
[33:01] that you say thank God but now
[33:03] afterwards you look back and say thank
[33:06] God
[33:06] if you going to a test I mean you you
[33:08] you you do a lot of battling don't you
[33:13] right but when you get to the end of it
[33:17] and God brings you something strong and
[33:19] this revelation or or tells you where
[33:22] you are well that just it's like woman
[33:24] it's like a woman having a child the
[33:26] pain is real but your sisters don't
[33:30] dwell them
[33:32] well boy when I had you know you know
[33:34] boy when I had Josh at 2:04 in the
[33:39] morning on April 4 20
[33:42] whatever it was they need more make what
[33:45] they made of 22nd see you know everybody
[33:48] came down there yeah he said bad work to
[33:53] me man she wouldn't mean being late but
[33:58] you don't put your over it I mean you
[34:00] don't do I wanted you you don't even
[34:01] remember you should remember the payment
[34:03] he endured that same thing with it no
[34:07] chastening for the present seemeth to be
[34:09] joyous why you in other words why you're
[34:10] going through it's pretty painful but
[34:12] greediest nevertheless afterwards it
[34:15] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[34:17] righteousness why because you move into
[34:19] a place that you know your child to go
[34:22] cause if he don't and you made it
[34:24] through and you're a better person for
[34:26] it that is not the devil if it continues
[34:31] on for years
[34:32] that's the devil you know you're having
[34:34] but I don't like Matthew you know you
[34:37] know Matthew was talking about - whether
[34:41] you having some kind of problem or
[34:42] something he just he's the Lord I'm he's
[34:44] telling us the other night he said lord
[34:46] I know you can do this what is wrong
[34:50] with me whatever I got it at the birth
[34:52] make you be done wait but when he got oh
[34:59] yeah they back way back is hurt yeah I'm
[35:02] not hurting he's bad would kill him
[35:04] because that's the way it is you not
[35:05] have split headaches and get up
[35:07] preaching it go away but when you go
[35:09] back into and
[35:10] study you can hear they come back but he
[35:13] was like saying Lord no what am I done
[35:14] well you know I know this is right I
[35:16] know this is the Word of God
[35:18] but remember see if God gives you that
[35:22] instantly where's the text where's the
[35:25] where's the the time trial all right
[35:29] this is not a this is not a microwave
[35:31] doctrine this is like a crock pot you
[35:34] know they scroll cooking you know for
[35:36] slow and stay it won't be joyous and it
[35:40] won't because man
[35:41] how many times you why now when you get
[35:43] through the end of it you said man that
[35:45] was just for me that was my the buddy
[35:47] going through it you're like Lord where
[35:50] are you like Maxie said what I done
[35:52] right but nevertheless afterward it
[35:55] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[35:57] righteousness unto them which are
[36:00] exercised thereby in other words going
[36:03] through it do you know what sometimes
[36:06] you may have to go to a trial so that
[36:08] somebody else may not have to go through
[36:10] that trial because they can't handle it
[36:11] like you think you ever thought of that
[36:15] you'll go through something to help
[36:17] someone else and for you to tell that
[36:19] testimony because you're the stronger
[36:22] because God's not will put any more on
[36:24] you then you can endure right and you
[36:27] think man sometimes he puts us back to
[36:30] them right to the edge of it but we're
[36:33] still here but you may have to go do it
[36:35] because you can handle it and that
[36:37] sister or brother can handle it and you
[36:39] can tell that brother or sister a
[36:41] testimony of how God led you through it
[36:43] and the stupid thing you've done to get
[36:45] into it and maybe they'll go a different
[36:47] direction and see that's something they
[36:49] can't handle that you can handle I was
[36:51] telling the sister Norma Jeffries when
[36:55] brother of difference died she said I
[36:58] don't know how I can handle this I said
[36:59] noma I said if you're a child of God we
[37:02] know juniors fine I said but you know
[37:04] one thing's for sure Jim may not take it
[37:07] like you can take it I'm still here I
[37:10] said but he took junior knowing you can
[37:12] take it and you can handle it cuz it
[37:14] how else are you going to explain that
[37:16] you can explain it no other way is it
[37:19] that whoever that person is going
[37:20] through a trial they can take it and
[37:22] they can use it for good and sister
[37:26] Norma has done done fine she get hi
[37:28] everybody it's lonely I guess at times
[37:30] when you lose
[37:31] never never had that happen before but
[37:33] but if you do know one thing's for sure
[37:35] if you're a child a guy doc don't you
[37:37] just gonna say okay I'm gonna take your
[37:39] husband and you just out there you know
[37:40] fend for yourself no no it's not that
[37:45] way with these children anything you
[37:47] don't really any trial or tribulation
[37:48] you go through it is for your benefit
[37:51] and your training right so that you can
[37:54] show others and teach others so Joe Joe
[37:59] come down and ask could we come up a
[38:00] little bit early so or earlier so we're
[38:03] going to do that right here look we're
[38:04] for a lift up the hands which hang down
[38:09] it's really easy to do this but lift up
[38:13] your hands let's hang down into people
[38:15] needs and make straight paths for your
[38:18] feet less that which is lame be turned
[38:21] out of the way but let it rather be
[38:25] healed with reporting's Paulo peace with
[38:28] all men and holiness without which no
[38:30] man shall see the Lord will stop there
[38:33] let's go they're probably still in the
[38:36] sons do for your wife
[38:38] [Music]
[38:43] you know outfits around here in this
