========================================

okay revelations chapter six let's just go ahead and read down through verse 8. all right so that's going to take care of the first four and today i will finish the review next sunday we will begin on the fifth seal so everybody read the fifth seal um what brother running priest on the fifth seal all right and i saw the lamb had opened one of the seals and i heard as it were excuse me the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw him behold a white horse and he said on him had a boat and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering him to conquer and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and they went out another horse it was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword look at all these things it says given power was given so satan has no power unless who gives it to him god allows him but we give him the power all right and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i'll be held and and lo a black horse and he that said on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst that the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny say i'll not hurt the oil and wine when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast which was white fourth beast is white eagle eagle lion ox man and eagle right here lion ox man an eagle the fourth beast is an eagle all right and when he had opened the fourth seal that's what we're gonna i didn't we're gonna back up to the fourth seal because we kind of covered one two and three but uh sister frieza is coming now new today and uh we might need to back up just a second and cover it and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name now there's no other name now talk about any name before then it's till now and his name that set on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given there you go again power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth all right we're gonna stop right there because the first four seals covers the plan of redemption all right it's not just if the white horse riders the antichrist i don't want satan revealed to me i want jesus christ revealed to me that's going to do away with satan right if christ is revealed paul said if christ be formed in us all right so christ is going to be formed in us everybody thinks the seal the great opening of the of the seals was that it it revealed the antichrist no it exposed the antichrist because the bible said all this power was given to this person but brother brown said when he comes over there and i believe it's an invisible union he said christ is the seal well everybody thought hold on the devil no christ is the seal this is the whole plan of redemption in four seals everybody understand that so far say yes yes all right but we got to take five six and seven for a special purpose but we've got to bring five six and seven right here and bring it right back to right here everybody understand that you don't say no no okay all right that's fine we're going to get to that because remember the rapture takes place on the fourth seal so we're gone then we don't need five six and seven no we don't not the earthly part that goes to the jews right five is a jewish what's six plagues great tribulation things falling on the earth we're not going to be here all right and we know the seventh seal is christ himself because he comes to get who he comes to get to jews through two witnesses is that correct all right we're gonna have participation from now on but if you don't you know if you don't understand it just say no and i'm not looking at who's gonna say no if i hear a no i'm going to stop we're going to cover it again all right so 5 6 and 7 seal 5 6 and 7 is naturally to the jews but if you don't take 5 6 and 7 and see the redemption of your body there's not going to be a rapture right we which are alive and remain is right here has all the seals revealed in their life all right because there's going to be untold millions of people have rapture in faith and they don't know a thing about seals paul had raptured faith irenaeus had a rapture in faith because you know what when a resurrection happens the faith that he had sorry the faith he still has in the sixth dimension is gonna what resurrect him so he has rapturing faith for his time but hebrews 11 40 says they without us cannot be made perfect so they without us say yes or no you got it yes yes they the ones that are dead already dead and gone paul william branham included he's dead they just like brother dick says until he's dead everybody else is they but if brother dick dies he comes under that part of that right okay they without us is going to get a true revelation of all seven seal the true revelation of the seventh seal not just what was printed in a book remember the love letter brother brown spent many many hours preaching of the love letter of what's between the lines all right that's why brother brown told the people he said it's gone from you you're not going to get it it's not even for you and that was in 1963 he said i run around the coming of the lord somebody's going to pick up the revelation of this and going to sweep it on to what the rapture all right so the rapture happens on the fourth seal now let's look just for the sake of having um helping some that's starting now which is wonderful i don't mind it the first seal was what a black righteous church went riding out right brother brown said here stands the lamb with the book's hand there goes the white horse rider therefore you must be the antichrist right now in the first in the first three ages the church ages paul irenaeus and martin is covered under this white righteous church i've been reading some more history on rome man you just can't believe what them people got by with but it was little sayings and little things that they would say to the people in the nicean council in in in 325 and in 606 a.d because the church ended really at 606 right here about where that night city council came out is when the third church age ended and then they went over into the dark ages which was about 1500 years of roman rule all right so if you read history it kind of ties into all the seals and the and the church ages so church age one two and three paul arenas and martin they were under the lion anointing lie l-i-o-n lion anointing which is what bold spoke of the king if you'll even read if you have a scofield bible let's look right here in matthew if you're looking at the commentary of matthew if you have if you don't go through the bible that's okay there's a commentary on page 990 you have a scofield bible it's right before the book of matthew there is a commentary even even um scofield watch it says and all the light is revealed the one unique personality the one jesus is king and matthew now what's king who's king of the beast lion all right servant and mark i'm quoting scofield servant and mark everybody got that you've got to go field bible reading page 990 in the footnotes down at the very bottom of the page and all the life is revealed the one unique personality the one jesus is king and matthew now schofield didn't get this from brother brown he died right before brother around god come on the scene all right so this was the lord revealing something to him to show him all right the one jesus is king in matthew ox our servant in mark which servant ox sacrifice man in luke and god and john are eagle everybody got that and then you look in your footnotes and when you go to saint matthew the first gospel there on page 993 talks about the king the covenant king the king the king the king the king the king then you go to mark it'll go to the ox and so forth so so this is not something that's not been and i don't i want you to listen to what i'm saying brother brown didn't come up with these things and he was not the original one to bring him out scofield talks about a theophany before brother brown megan came on the earth but what did god do brother branham come in to tie all the loose ends because scofield will go so far and then he'll lean toward that trinity right he'll lean toward the trinity but what brother ronald have to do he come to bring the loose ends back together and put us on a straight path where we can look at this and go hey this was correct in its day but not right in our day because see they baptized father son holy ghost here that baptized father father son holy ghost in three ages and part of that age and god give them eternal life because of their ignorance of the preaching of the gospel that that the devil had come in and lied to the people but now one two and three church age one two and three they have the name of jesus right all things were right and correct that was the lion that was the boldness of god in the people all right so there was your lion of the first beast which the lion said come and see all right then the white horse rider goes right now well why why do we want to say well there goes satan no there goes satan but what happened first god had to do something first satan is never original right satan never does anything original never he's always copying after god right so god already then had a white righteous church on the scene the book of acts started the white righteous church the real one so in opposition satan starts in a little saying little sayings little things hey what about this virgin mary and what about this um virgin mary and what about all these things there was a white righteous church disguised satan disguised itself because hey there was a white righteous church so satan copied after that white righteous church and put his own white righteous church out there and they ate down you go down through the through the four the four um caterpillar locusts we don't have time to do that but you can put them everyone in here the same way because they first start eating the leaves which is fellowship or fellowship and then they start eating the bark broth around which is the doctrine and then all you so right here they started with the doctrine satan started and said hey what about this is he a separate person from god or just like that ceremonies corinthians was way back here saying that jesus wasn't god until the holy ghost came on him uh on the river jordan well guess what we got preachers in the message preaching the same thing that this guy was preaching in the first church age that was the devil same spirit remember the serrentius got the he was even in a bathhouse and remember who was it paul arenas or one of them or martin one of them ran out of the bathhouse and said i ain't gonna be in the bath house for this guy he's so wrong so off the word well you know what devils don't die devils will not be killed until the lake of fire so they're still alive and well like brother claude and i were talking the other night that man over in iran that ahmadinejad he's got the same characteristics and spirit that adolf hitler has he's wanted to do the same thing it's just in a little different form well when that devil come off adolf hitler when they killed him and burned him over there in germany that same devil just went over there and found somebody that would accept him over here all right in this age so same thing devils don't die they just kind of move around all right but god never dies and never will die and the holy ghost is more powerful than any of this so that's what we have to depend on so we see the first aid just typed in justification in us being once you're justified you're white righteous you're just as righteous as god is because your sins are forgiven but now remember the journey that you continue on you still got that smoking devil cussing devil and all that stuff still in you right but when you come to sanctification what is red blood the only thing that sanctifies us is what the blood of thank you the blood of jesus christ i don't know love jesus christ if i said he wanted a hundred dollars i got a bigger a better answer than that all right so the second horse goes right now it's a red horse blood brother brown said that red horse rode through and killed what's the fourth ace that's the dark age remember 68 million protestants were killed in that fourth church age under the office anointing all they done was just said i believe in god and they killed them but but god sealed them away and put them in the body of christ because they believed the message for their hour under columba you know that say yes yes all right red horse blood means blood is red right blood is red so the red horse rider literally killed 68 million protestants shed their literal red blood but brother brown said untold billions they killed with their doctrine all right because that's going to untold millions that kill the doctrine is going to come over here in black and black there's one dead black always means death right there's no light in death all right so black is death so we see that the fourth age fourth church age parallels with the second seal and sanctification for us because the only way we're to be sanctified is what by the blood of jesus christ that's what the bible says all right and sanctification remember the bible says we read it the other day the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks in dry places take his rest and find his nine comes back if you don't get filled with the holy ghost he's gonna make you seven times worse he ain't gonna make it seven times worth of devil he's gonna make you a christian so-called and put you in church all right that's why i said last night when we were talking in the bible study sanctification is a very very wonderful place to be in but it's a very very terrible place to be in if you stay there because judas was sanctified the devil himself the devil himself can live this message the devil himself can live this message but he can't put the word together all right he can live he can live this message to the letter and still be lost but sanctification the unclean spirit does go out right that's right see see the smoking drinking cussing and all that should go out here you shouldn't have any problems with it here i don't mean problem i mean you shouldn't have that thing inside of you to where it comes out you remember my story i believe i received the baptism of the holy ghost back in in and one no two thousand and uh in kentucky and jim's dad motorhome i just believe that's where god you know finally after i quit trying to get it he gave it to me but see going down the road i used to say bad words and i'm telling the critic because you hadn't heard it i used to say a lot of bad words a lot a lot right part of my vocabulary in other words it was just part of the website but i was talking to a friend of mine that was a previous friend back in the world and we were talking about something and and in my mind i wanted to say i want to kick that guy in a double s but when i got the a out of my mouth to say that something hit me right here just went punched me right here in the chest and all the air my lungs went out and and ken said what did you do i saw don't worry about it i was going to say a bad word the lord stopped me so he had a long silence because he don't understand this stuff anyway so the lord preserves me to keep me from saying it brother branham said hand me the cigarette hand me the alcohol he was going to partake of it right but god stopped him right all right and you know what somebody asked that question said well why is he playing favoritism to brother brown he wasn't playing favoritism to the man he was playing favoritism to the gift he was going to keep that gift clean and you can't take the man in the gift and separate it so he had to keep william branham clean because we can't keep ourselves clean we gotta have what daily i die daily a daily sanctification all right that's why we need experiences in our life for god to show us what stage of the journey we're in and i made a statement last night and i'm not gonna back on that one to back up on it one bit ninety percent of people in this message are probably just sanctified but it says fear not little flop not a great big one but if you're in sanctification then you can move on then to the baptism of the holy ghost praise god you may walk 20 years in a church and be sanctified but one day god if god will honor your faith to believe that you received the baptism of the holy ghost because you're always believing unto you you're believing unto that's right yes but i still you i want y'all to read if you still got root of bitterness and all these things in your life read the prophet's message he was very clear those things need to be out of our life and gone yeah they don't need to be something that resurrects that's right it needs to be dead when it's dead you can't accuse it enough amen you can't bring it back up you can't accuse me of that because it's dead all right my grandpa was he died in 1945. you can't accuse him in 196 uh in 2011 of a of a murder or or you can accuse all you want to but sam dale's dead so unless he resurrects and wasn't dead to start with he can't do these things that's the same way when we did the baptism sunday baptism you're dead leave it there let the water wash it out of you and come back up in units of life all right but i just i that's just my that's just my thoughts seeing how people act and react that sanctification is a very wonderful place to be because he does forgive you of all that stuff all that stuff goes out of you that sanctification but now remember too you got to believe on you got to come from the red and go into the number three which is the black horse all right now the black horse rider went out he went out and done the same thing but what did god do god brought a man anointing fifth and sixth church age i've said a lot in 20 minutes god stopped that clock because i want him to stop that clock so we can get this done so i keep looking at it and ain't moving much fifth and sixth church age is under the third seal everybody got that same man all right so that and that's a man anointing now the fifth age was what luther and wesley luther started putting the bible together right king james and all in 1611 and all those times in history reedy's hit you guys went to school all these histories like constantine and all that don't you remember those when brother brown brings them up they're in history it's common history so this is not something that that wasn't made known it's just that brother brown pulled it all together and said hey this is why this happened this is why this happened they said well this happened he tied the loose ends up gave us a straight way to go all right fifth and six eights luther and wesley correct all right the man anointing right according to your combat beast lion ox man an eagle man anointing it was a black horse which was death but now remember it wasn't named death they were still baptized in the name of father son holy ghost not the name of jesus christ so they didn't have a name right but the blackness of that age blacks a lot of people out but you can also you say well what's black got to do with having the holy ghost just what i said if you're if satan is not dead in you you don't have a holy god god can't dwell on an unclean vessel that's just common knowledge but the black horse means that you're dead you died i died up there in in kentucky uh on set on a river or lake i died that's where i died sure i got baptized and i walked in newness of life through justification sanctification but when i come to a spot where god says that old you is gone you don't have to worry about that old you anymore that ought to just thrill your heart that's why i think that a lot of people's not at that point yet because it will really it'll change everything your thought process it'll change your ideas it'll change all it'll make you soft remember he takes the stony heart out he doesn't put a board back in what do you say i put a flesh is pliable right yeah and that's what that is flesh is pliable he takes a stoney heart out and puts a heart of flesh back in he doesn't give you a heart transplant but what does he do he softens up the one you got not your heart your thumping thing but the inner part of you he softens you up and makes you a christian all right so one two and three is everybody okay with that yeah all right number four number four is the fourth horse rider it is a pale horse now if you take i told you before take the color black red and white put it in the bucket and stir it up you've got the most putrid grayish reddish it just looks nasty but that's what that pale horse is it's this one plus this one plus this one all wrapped up into that one right because you say well how can you explain express that justification wrapped up in the sanctification wrapped up into the baptism of the holy ghost makes you agree with the word makes you the word not a different person makes you the word made manifest right so white horse red horse all these demons are now piled up into this age so every demon that this age fall we gotta fight that's right this eighth fault we gotta fight this age fought we gotta fight because it's all made into a pale horse and the bible says his name was called death now he was deaf back here right remember he was death here he was death all through him satan's never life he's always death so satan started his death but there was nobody could name it until the evil anointing come so he could go up higher see further and be able to turn back and say hey that thing's named death you need to leave it alone get rid of it all right so in the word is life so the word went forth in the fourth seal which is a parallel now it's like parallel with the seventh church age that's the age we're in right now which is the eagle anointing the lion he's about this tall but if his grass is tall i don't care how powerful he is he can't see any further than the grass the ox is a little bit higher he's about this side he can maybe see over the grass but he's very slow very burdensome right the man you and i we can see further than any of those animals because we're taller we can see further right but now the eagle when he gets up he sees as far that way that way that went that way all right so that's why i had to come in the eagle age you could see that god was raising the people higher well as god was raising the people higher higher the devil's not a dummy he's going right with him right into a pale horse so he's having to use all these powers against us because we're the true church because we got to have rapture in faith we got to be the one that called the dead out of the ground the dead in christ arrives first and we which are alive and remain to be caught up and meet the lord in the air all right so brother brown that's why brother brown said the rapture happens on the fourth seal now look you don't get it in your mind that then five six and seven is for the jews only and it's it is naturally it goes to the jews but spiritually we gotta bring that thing right back around because we're all jews spiritually right not all israel is israel all right so not all randomized for ramadan or brown you understand what i'm saying but you got to take these last three seals and you got to bring them around and put them inside somebody because this is what's got to change that was my point to finish with look this age had a rapture and faith for its time but it didn't have all the work right this church age had just enough to get them in the body a little bit of light but still though it doesn't matter they're not going to sit on little stools and we're going to sit on the stool okay we're all bright when they said thrones they put the thrones in one spot all right they're going to judge they're going to judge their age just like you and i are going to judge our age it's just that they're going to judge their age and say hey you turned down god's going to say hey you turned down what this brother columba was saying therefore you go to hell right so they're just as important yes same way with luke and wesley even though they didn't bring the name out they still baptized fathers unholy ghost believed in the trinity but winked at their ignorance because what the eagle anointing had not come to raise on earth to put all the loose ends back together and give us and this is what's going to give us rapturing faith i told you many times before the reason that i can't rewire a house is because i don't understand electricity these church age messengers did not understand rapture and faith they just knew they had to have it so they were believing unto you everybody got that but now see if i go to school and let a master teacher that can see further see higher put all the loose ends together you know what that takes out all fear because a master electrician can look in this room and go okay we need to put wires here and here see richard did all this right here i can't do that richard you didn't glue that back he's got faith he knows he has knowledge about what he's doing that's what rapture and faith is they didn't have the knowledge to get them out to get them out of here they'd have the knowledge they had to wait till the eagle morning come to the seventh church age messenger come so brother brown would come and reveal god to us to open these seals up to us now we can have rapture in faith there's only going to be a very minou group of people that's going to understand these three and change their bodies all right the rest are going to be they which are alive and remain but you know what you're going to go down let's read rotate right before we leave see this kind of puts it all in perspective to me romans 8 verse 11. let's read 10 and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness all right but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you now they had it in this age they had in this age and this age in this age they had the spirit of god if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost you've got the spirit that same spirit that raised up jesus from the dead is living in you today right right all right and if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you dwell not just on you but in you you can have the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost every day you laugh and die and go to hell now that's a direct quote from the prophet all right you gotta have it in you not on you in you right the devil can have it on him anointing one's a 10 time reed brother brown said it's the true anointing of the holy ghost on a false person don't get close and if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwell in you when we call for the dead to come out of the ground what paul paul's holy ghost will quicken the body that paul lived in because we do not believe in getting a new body right it's this body made new just like the earth brother brandon preach future home this body is not to be annihilated it's just to be burnt over and made new all right so what brought what paul went in the ground the spirit that raised him up from dead is in the sixth dimension after theophany is going to come back and pick up that human body quicken it change it just like it did out i mean abraham's body and set him right here in this i say this church but you understand what i'm saying the bride where we can see him well that's what's quickening but he didn't know anything about seal he didn't know anything about son of man ministering see he believed in jesus christ that's what put him in the place he was in same way with all these people but you and i have come to a place where we can't throw it to another group we've got to either understand it or we're going to die and somebody else is going to raise us and understand it one point that's my brother none of them had their body no spirit had to be right right but we have body spirit and that body's got to be changed this body's got to be changed so we're going to start on seal number five next sunday morning i hope that wasn't fast for you
