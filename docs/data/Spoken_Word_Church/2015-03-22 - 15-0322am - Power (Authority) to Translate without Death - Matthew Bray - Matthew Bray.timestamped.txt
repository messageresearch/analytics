[1:08] but we do the best we can to try to feed
[1:10] you at least a piece of chicken you know
[1:13] and to have a good time doing that amen
[1:15] so just remember that i know you've done
[1:18] announced it terence did but remember
[1:19] brother donnie he's something happened
[1:22] to his leg and
[1:23] it swelled up and all and we've been
[1:25] trying to get him go to doctor and he
[1:27] thought it was a hire growing in it or
[1:29] something but it really got swelled up
[1:31] on him and everything them and they put
[1:33] him in the hospital last night after the
[1:35] service here and they're supposed to be
[1:37] doing it maybe already through now but
[1:40] they were supposed to be doing it this
[1:41] morning they're supposed to give us a
[1:43] notice
[1:45] out of surgery already because they were
[1:47] going to try to drain all of the stuff
[1:49] and said it there's a good thing he got
[1:51] there because it could have caused
[1:53] damage to the to the knee and the things

[7:47] encourage your heart invite you over
[7:48] here to ephesians chapter two
[7:51] and we'll let you be seated praise god
[7:53] after we read god's word here
[7:55] appreciate the word of the lord amen
[7:58] i'm so glad god sent this message in
[8:01] these last days
[8:02] where would we be without the message
[8:05] where would we be without the opening of
[8:06] the word amen
[8:08] praise god
[8:13] in ephesians chapter 2
[8:15] you just read verse 4 to verse 6.
[8:18] it says but god who is rich in mercy
[8:21] for his great love or with he loved
[8:24] us amen
[8:27] that love and that capstone right there
[8:29] right
[8:30] even when we were dead and sins hath
[8:33] quickened us together with christ
[8:36] by grace you are saved and hath raised
[8:40] us up together
[8:42] yesterday we talked about shiloh and the
[8:44] seventh seal
[8:45] and the point that i was trying to make
[8:47] is that when the mystery of the seventh
[8:49] seal opens
[8:51] that's where the elect are gathered by
[8:53] that opening of that mystery
[8:56] and shiloh is a gathering place so
[8:58] that's why i was connecting that to the
[9:00] seventh seal
[9:02] and hath raised us up together and made
[9:04] us sit together in heavenly places
[9:07] in christ jesus
[9:09] amen that gathering place in christ amen
[9:12] dear heavenly father god as we have just
[9:15] read your word lord we ask for your holy
[9:17] spirit to come quicken it to our hearts
[9:19] lord and help us to recognize our true
[9:21] place and our position in you father
[9:23] said we might be completely subjected
[9:25] lord god and just so take us into your
[9:28] hands father and use us in these closing
[9:31] hours of the gentile dispensation help
[9:33] us to be made ready father god we pray
[9:36] in jesus christ mighty name amen
[9:39] amen god bless you be seated
[9:41] just love and appreciate you all so much
[9:44] i would like to also direct your
[9:45] attention something i didn't tell the
[9:47] brothers this but matthew chapter 8 will
[9:49] kind of go along with the point that
[9:51] we're going to try to make here
[9:53] now
[9:54] we know that
[9:56] adoption is a mighty important subject
[9:58] amen
[10:00] coming into position coming into your
[10:03] placing amen
[10:05] in matthew chapter 8
[10:08] jesus
[10:09] has an encounter with a centurion a
[10:11] servant from a centurion
[10:13] and uh
[10:14] jesus made a statement he marveled at
[10:16] the faith of the centurion and
[10:21] in verse 8 the centurion answered and
[10:23] said lord i'm not worthy that thou
[10:25] should has come under my roof but speak
[10:27] the word only
[10:29] and my servant shall be healed
[10:31] for i am a man under authority
[10:34] amen
[10:35] i'm a man under authority
[10:39] so the thing that we want to title this
[10:42] little sharing with you today is uh the
[10:44] power or the authority to translate
[10:46] without death
[10:48] okay
[10:50] now we know brother brown said to be
[10:52] presumptuous means
[10:53] to adventure without authority amen so
[10:57] you got to have authority right but that
[10:59] authority is based upon the word of god
[11:02] the authority is based upon a scriptural
[11:04] authority
[11:06] amen
[11:07] so
[11:08] we're taught now in these last days that
[11:12] it's impossible to have the correct kind
[11:14] of faith
[11:15] if you don't know the hour that you're
[11:18] living in
[11:19] if you don't know what part of the word
[11:21] god has manifested in the hour that you
[11:23] live in your faith cannot be
[11:25] appropriated correctly
[11:28] for like the days of noah he knew it was
[11:30] revealed to him it was time to build an
[11:32] ark
[11:33] but that wouldn't work in the days of
[11:34] moses
[11:36] moses was to bring in exodus that was a
[11:38] part of the word he was fulfilled in
[11:40] that day amen
[11:41] so it's impossible to really have real
[11:44] faith
[11:45] unless you know what part of the word
[11:47] god's manifesting the day that you're
[11:48] living in
[11:50] we as message people are so blessed
[11:52] to have what we have today because god
[11:54] has showed us what has been
[11:56] what it's all been brought up to and
[11:58] what the very next step is
[12:00] amen we know we're living at the very
[12:02] end of the gentile dispensation and god
[12:05] has showed us by the opening of this
[12:07] word here what part of the word we're
[12:10] living in
[12:11] amen
[12:12] so it's by scriptural authority
[12:16] we can declare we're living in last days
[12:19] people say well they said they was
[12:21] living in the last days 500 years ago
[12:24] but now we've had the opening of the
[12:25] seven seals
[12:27] jesus christ has descended from heaven
[12:29] with a shout out with the little book
[12:31] open in his hand amen and now we know
[12:34] we're living in the last days
[12:36] the last of the last days
[12:39] it's at the end time jesus does this
[12:41] amen
[12:43] so this centurion tells the lord he says
[12:46] that i am
[12:47] for i am a man under authority having
[12:49] soldiers under me and i say to this man
[12:52] go and he goeth and to another come and
[12:54] he cometh and to my servant do this and
[12:56] he does it when jesus heard it he
[12:59] marveled
[13:00] right
[13:01] the man knew about position
[13:04] the man knew about his placing
[13:07] he knew about how to exercise the
[13:09] authority that he had because he
[13:11] understood the position that he was in
[13:13] he knew how the authority went down and
[13:16] he knew how the authority worked coming
[13:18] from above
[13:19] is that right
[13:20] so jesus marveled at this and jesus
[13:23] heard it he marveled and said to them
[13:25] that followed verily i send you i have
[13:28] not found so great faith no not in
[13:30] israel
[13:32] this was a gentile that understood that
[13:34] jesus was exercising authority
[13:38] so our lord jesus christ had to be under
[13:40] authority
[13:42] amen
[13:43] do you know god himself won't even cross
[13:45] his own word
[13:47] that's right god stays with his own word
[13:49] and jesus stayed with the scripture
[13:52] jesus came to do exactly what the father
[13:54] sent him to do
[13:56] so jesus himself was subjected to the
[13:59] word
[14:01] and so much that our lord as his custom
[14:04] was went into the synagogue
[14:06] where he was brought up in nazareth and
[14:07] it was handed to him the book of the
[14:08] scroll of isaiah amen
[14:11] and we all know what happened he read
[14:13] the specific part of the scripture that
[14:16] was applied to that very hour
[14:18] and he stopped at a certain point
[14:20] because the rest of it in isaiah 61 was
[14:23] applied for another day
[14:25] but the lord jesus christ knew what part
[14:28] was written of him in that very hour to
[14:31] be fulfilled at that very time
[14:34] now that's pretty good that's authority
[14:37] that's knowing where your what your
[14:38] position is
[14:40] amen
[14:42] so
[14:42] there's a quote here in marriage in
[14:44] divorce
[14:46] and we get the brothers to bring that up
[14:47] there it's uh
[14:50] paragraph 143.
[14:54] no i'm sorry 144.
[14:57] the part we got highlighted right here
[14:59] he says but the real saints of god looks
[15:02] for the character of the vindicated word
[15:08] the character of the vindicated word
[15:11] that's what the saints did in that day
[15:13] when they seen jesus he wasn't nothing
[15:15] to look at but they seen god was in him
[15:18] they seen god was with him
[15:22] so the real saints of god
[15:25] look for the character of the vindicated
[15:27] word
[15:28] amen
[15:29] vindicated word meaning the word being
[15:31] fulfilled the word coming to pass
[15:34] the light that's shining in the hour
[15:36] that you live in is the vindicated word
[15:39] that's what the real saints of god look
[15:40] for
[15:41] a real child of god is made to realize
[15:45] what part of the word is manifested in
[15:47] the age that they live in
[15:49] amen
[15:51] this is connected to us operate in our
[15:54] exercise and authority
[15:56] brother braham said it's spiritual
[15:57] revelation on the word that gives you
[15:59] authority over the devil
[16:02] is that right
[16:04] so i couldn't exercise much authority if
[16:06] i stand up here and try to deliver a
[16:08] message from martin luther
[16:11] huh
[16:12] if i say bless god we're all lutherans
[16:15] i'd be way off base right because that
[16:18] part was already made up
[16:20] is that right
[16:22] so the secret things of god
[16:25] has been hidden in this word
[16:27] that's right right
[16:29] but these things that was hidden in the
[16:30] word has been brought out in these last
[16:32] days
[16:33] is that right
[16:35] and it's those hidden things that's
[16:36] brought to the end time brian it gives
[16:38] her this authority
[16:41] okay
[16:42] so
[16:43] we realize
[16:45] how incredible this is by the way
[16:46] because
[16:48] the spoken words the original seed
[16:52] and if there's mysteries hidden in the
[16:53] bible
[16:55] what way does god have to bring those
[16:57] mysteries out of the written word amen
[16:59] amen by speaking them right
[17:02] like when abraham and sarah would turn
[17:04] back young again
[17:05] nobody knew that
[17:07] that was hidden in the word
[17:09] but god anointed a prophet
[17:12] to speak it under the holy ghost
[17:15] influence
[17:16] and now when he speaks it you take it
[17:18] and look in the word and you even you
[17:20] even see how it's true
[17:22] it happened twice
[17:24] she was an old lady and she went down
[17:26] there and the king lusted after her
[17:27] beauty
[17:29] right right but that was hidden in the
[17:32] word right
[17:34] but how is it that that which is hidden
[17:36] is brought out right
[17:38] it's when the prophet speaks it under
[17:40] the anointing of the spirit
[17:41] and you're supposed to be hearing it
[17:43] under the anointing of the spirit
[17:46] you know what i suggest if you don't if
[17:47] you don't have it find a way to get you
[17:49] one of those ipods and load all those
[17:51] sermons on there and just play it
[17:53] constantly in your house
[17:55] because that holy ghost is speaking
[17:58] speaking things right out of this word
[18:00] right here that unlocks scripture right
[18:02] now is that right
[18:04] and that's where the love letter is
[18:06] in between the lines amen
[18:09] and that's where you get authority amen
[18:12] amen so you have this example of serpent
[18:16] seed
[18:18] nobody really could understand certain
[18:19] seed correctly until god spoke it
[18:21] through his prophet that's right amen
[18:23] amen
[18:24] god said right there i'll put enmity
[18:26] between thee and the woman between thy
[18:27] seed and her seed
[18:30] well thy seed he's speaking to the
[18:31] serpent
[18:33] the serpent had a seed
[18:34] he says it right there in the word
[18:37] but wasn't brought out there until
[18:38] somebody got anointed and spoke it
[18:42] spoken word is the original seed
[18:45] it's the spoken word that expresses the
[18:47] thought of jehovah
[18:48] the message of the hour is the expressed
[18:51] thoughts of jehovah
[18:53] amen
[18:54] the thing has to be spoken
[18:56] so on the day of pentecost when the holy
[18:58] ghost fell and they come stumbling out
[19:00] there they thought those people were
[19:02] drunk
[19:02] but peter the bible says peter got up
[19:05] and lifted up his voice
[19:07] said these are not drunken as you
[19:08] suppose but this is that which was
[19:10] spoken by the prophet joel
[19:12] and joe
[19:13] and peter spoke
[19:15] and gave qualification to what was
[19:17] happening in that very moment and tied
[19:19] it to the scripture
[19:21] identified the
[19:22] manifestation as something that had
[19:25] already been written in the word
[19:27] amen
[19:28] remember when the eunuch was coming back
[19:30] from jerusalem on his way back
[19:33] and the holy ghost told philip to go
[19:35] join himself to that
[19:36] chariot and he was reading from the book
[19:39] of isaiah
[19:41] and philip said understand us thou what
[19:43] thou readest and he said how can i
[19:45] accept some man guide me
[19:48] is that right so the holy ghost sent his
[19:51] man philip to that unit because he had a
[19:53] hungry heart he was seeking the lord
[19:56] he was seeking the truth
[19:58] and god had a man right there for that
[20:00] hour to speak
[20:02] over that written word
[20:04] and it came to life to that eunuch
[20:07] right
[20:08] the bible says philip opened up his
[20:10] mouth
[20:12] amen
[20:13] spoken word shedding light on the
[20:15] written word
[20:17] that's why it's so important to hear the
[20:19] message that's why it's so important to
[20:21] hear good teaching and good preaching
[20:23] amen
[20:24] praise the lord
[20:25] so thank god for the truth
[20:28] amen in ephesians chapter 6 verse 19
[20:30] brother paul was praying or telling the
[20:32] ephesians to to pray
[20:34] and and pray for me that utterance would
[20:37] be given to me that i might open up my
[20:39] mouth and make known the mysteries
[20:42] that's right that's how it's brought out
[20:45] spoken word amen you got to speak it the
[20:48] only way to make anybody conscious of
[20:50] anything is to speak it to them
[20:52] that's right
[20:54] you got to be able to speak and you got
[20:55] to be able to hear
[20:57] you got to have an open heart and open
[20:58] mind to be able to receive the word
[21:00] is that right
[21:02] amen to god that's right we want that
[21:04] holy ghost utterance and we want the
[21:06] ability to hear what the spirit is
[21:08] saying amen
[21:10] so praise god brothers and sisters we're
[21:11] living in a fantastic hour absolutely
[21:14] outstanding time when the whole mystery
[21:17] and the whole plan of redemption has
[21:19] been fully disclosed to the end-time
[21:21] bride
[21:23] as we were trying to illustrate
[21:24] yesterday i don't believe there's any
[21:26] puzzle pieces missing
[21:27] i just tell you the truth right now i
[21:29] believe the message is perfect i believe
[21:31] it's complete if there's anything else
[21:33] for the prophet to do
[21:34] amen right
[21:36] it's been done right right
[21:38] brother amen i believe the message is
[21:40] perfect
[21:41] i believe it's complete
[21:43] it just takes the holy ghost inspiration
[21:45] to see it
[21:46] and it's fullness
[21:48] ain't no puzzle piece is missing
[21:50] it's all been put together
[21:52] the picture's been put together you just
[21:54] have to gaze intently upon the unveiled
[21:56] one
[21:57] the one that's come unveiled amen
[22:00] revelations 10 7 introduced revelations
[22:02] 10 1.
[22:04] he's been unveiled the apocalypse is the
[22:06] unveiling
[22:08] amen
[22:09] you know what you look at is what you're
[22:10] going to reflect in your life
[22:12] the thing that's magnified the thing
[22:14] that's always on your mind what you're
[22:15] looking at right i've heard young kids
[22:17] say bless god i ain't never going to be
[22:19] like my mom and dad
[22:22] and they end up being just like them
[22:23] because that's all they're looking at
[22:26] huh
[22:27] what you study and what you gaze upon is
[22:29] what's reflected in your life and the
[22:31] bible says you need to look in the
[22:32] mirror of the word
[22:34] to be studying the revelation and the
[22:37] unveiled word amen
[22:41] because a life lived by the word would
[22:43] be the word expressed amen
[22:46] now you remember in
[22:48] the book of genesis whenever adam and
[22:50] eve fell
[22:51] god put four cherubims around the tree
[22:54] of life
[22:55] brother branch said it was the four
[22:56] cherubims you know the lion the ox the
[22:58] man the eagle
[23:00] he said there's only four ways you can
[23:01] go so all four approaches to the tree
[23:04] was blocked off right amen
[23:06] well whenever that the lord showed moses
[23:09] how to build the temple
[23:11] and whenever they put the veil between
[23:12] the most holy and the holy place they
[23:15] did a work
[23:17] of weaving into the veil the cherubims
[23:20] the bible says they put the cherubims in
[23:22] there right
[23:23] so when jesus died on the cross and the
[23:25] temple veil was rent from top to bottom
[23:27] the veils was removed so the cherubims
[23:30] was moved out of the way
[23:31] so you can have access amen
[23:34] by faith uh we have peace with god
[23:37] through our lord jesus christ by whom we
[23:39] have access into this grace is that
[23:42] right
[23:43] so brother brown says there was a time
[23:45] when the cherubims was blocking man from
[23:47] the tree of life but in the book of
[23:48] revelations they're trying to drive man
[23:50] to the tree of life
[23:52] amen
[23:54] and we realize now in the opening of the
[23:56] seven seals that the churches through
[23:57] the ages was anointed with these
[23:59] cherubims
[24:01] and the early church age is anointed
[24:03] with the character of a lion the holy
[24:05] spirit was anointing the people the
[24:06] boldness
[24:08] praise god they beat the apostle paul
[24:10] drug him out there in the road and leave
[24:12] him dead he got right back up and went
[24:14] in there and preached some more that's
[24:16] pretty bold if you drug me out here stop
[24:19] me in the parking lot i'd probably get
[24:20] in my car and go home
[24:23] but back then there was anointed with
[24:25] the lion
[24:26] the boldness of a lion
[24:28] they were bold
[24:30] they had to be bold
[24:32] and then the age went on you know you
[24:33] come to the dark edge it was anointed
[24:35] with that oxen on him that's sacrificial
[24:38] servitude
[24:39] in spite of all the persecution it just
[24:41] kept right on strong as an ox
[24:44] animal sacrifice is that right
[24:48] and in the finally the age came the
[24:49] trueness of a man
[24:51] and the the founding fathers of the
[24:53] united states forged the constitution
[24:55] there's shrewd people right it was under
[24:57] that anointing
[24:58] right
[24:59] finally it comes to our day
[25:02] and people wonder what we got what we
[25:03] get what we get it we can't help it
[25:05] because we're anointed
[25:07] we're anointed to see what we see
[25:09] it's a prophetic anointing
[25:11] amen
[25:12] the whole word's been given
[25:14] is that right
[25:16] you notice the lion is an earth-bound
[25:18] creature the ox is earthbound right the
[25:20] man's earthbound but the ego ain't right
[25:23] the ego's a flying eagle
[25:25] anointed
[25:26] to fly they have a prophetic
[25:29] understanding amen
[25:31] that's why we see what we see
[25:34] that's right and that's why in that love
[25:35] that lov that's lion ox the visage of a
[25:38] man an eagle
[25:40] this banner over me is love
[25:42] amen
[25:43] praise god for that love
[25:45] god ministers for his saints in each and
[25:47] every age and anoints them according to
[25:49] what they need right amen we needed the
[25:52] prophetic anointing in this hour to be
[25:54] able to withstand that antichrist spirit
[25:56] amen to rise above all the influence of
[25:58] the antichrist
[26:00] praise god i'm so glad for that
[26:02] anointing today to see what we see and
[26:05] come up become a part of christ in this
[26:07] age in this hour praise the lord
[26:11] uh
[26:13] let's look at this quote here in
[26:14] identification
[26:17] the brothers want to bring that up
[26:24] let's see here can you identify yourself
[26:26] with peter on the day of pentecost
[26:28] can you identify yourself there in acts
[26:31] 2 where the people say today the holy
[26:33] ghost was only given to the 12 apostles
[26:35] can you identify yourself with peter
[26:37] when he said repent every one of you and
[26:39] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[26:41] for remission of your sins and you shall
[26:43] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[26:44] the promises unto you and to your
[26:46] children to them that's far off even as
[26:48] many as the lord god shall call
[26:49] this same holy ghost
[26:51] do you identify yourself there
[26:54] with him on that day
[26:57] i stand with you peter yes sir upon your
[26:59] fundamental teachings of the scripture i
[27:02] stand there i want my life to reflect
[27:04] the scripture
[27:06] just like yours did there when 3000 was
[27:09] pricked in their hearts
[27:10] when they seen the boldness of them amen
[27:14] a few days after that they knowed they
[27:16] had been with jesus
[27:18] they had the word and they know the word
[27:19] was living right through them
[27:21] and they was
[27:23] afraid to tamper with that word of god
[27:25] because there was representatives of
[27:27] that word with such a life that god
[27:29] would reflect himself right through
[27:32] amen told a man silver and gold have i
[27:35] none i don't have big buildings and
[27:37] great big things such as i have i will
[27:39] give you in the name of jesus christ
[27:41] stand upon your feet such as i have amen
[27:45] now
[27:46] identification in the scripture
[27:49] is
[27:51] a tremendous revelation
[27:53] in these last days
[27:55] to be able to find our place in our
[27:57] position in christ the word amen
[28:01] now you might remember early in brother
[28:03] branham's
[28:04] ministry
[28:05] he was ordained as a missionary baptist
[28:08] and uh
[28:10] sometimes he would tell about some of
[28:12] the minister brothers tell them about
[28:15] what would happen to him
[28:16] and they'd say no brother branham that's
[28:18] of the devil
[28:20] falling into trances and seeing visions
[28:22] and everything like this and brother
[28:23] branham would cry and say oh brother
[28:25] mckinney pray with me i don't want to be
[28:26] a devil
[28:28] but the ministry was telling him that
[28:30] and getting brother random all tore up
[28:32] so he's in the yard one day
[28:34] and he fell into a trance and he's
[28:36] staggering over there in the front porch
[28:38] and he sits down sister amita brings him
[28:40] a glass of water and he says me to honey
[28:42] i'm going into them woods and i'm not
[28:44] coming out until god takes this thing
[28:45] away from me
[28:47] because the ministry was telling him
[28:49] that it was of the devil
[28:52] he was all tore up
[28:54] so he goes into the woods there in his
[28:56] trapping cabin and he's been praying all
[28:58] night brother brahman says two o'clock
[29:00] came three o'clock came
[29:02] seeking the lord all night long and
[29:04] finally that light coming to the room
[29:07] and that angel came barefooted walking
[29:09] in the room he says do not fear i come
[29:12] from the presence of almighty god
[29:14] and what did that angel do for brother
[29:16] branham
[29:18] when you watch that read that story
[29:20] that angel took brother random into the
[29:22] scriptures and showed him his life and
[29:24] the purpose that he was on earth for
[29:27] that's what that angel did
[29:29] brother brahm left that place a new man
[29:32] god sent an angel to show brother
[29:34] branham his identification in this word
[29:36] and brother branham is the angel that
[29:38] god sent to you to open up this word to
[29:40] show your identification in this word
[29:43] amen
[29:45] that's what this is all about the
[29:47] message is sent to us in these last days
[29:49] to show us our true identity in christ
[29:53] amen and this is where the authority
[29:55] comes from
[29:56] this is where you begin to understand
[29:58] your place in your position this is
[30:00] where you begin to come into a place
[30:02] where you can exercise true authority
[30:05] over the flesh over the devil and over
[30:07] the world
[30:09] because your place in christ has been
[30:11] revealed to you
[30:13] amen
[30:14] now you think about that
[30:16] brother branham was born april 6 1909
[30:19] but all the bible had already been
[30:20] written
[30:22] 1900 years
[30:23] so brother branham's growing up he comes
[30:25] to a place in his life he hits this
[30:27] crisis he goes into the place and he
[30:29] starts seeking god in earnest and the
[30:31] lord sends him an angel opens the
[30:33] scripture to him
[30:34] and shows brother branham the ministry
[30:36] calls it bails above then and they're
[30:38] doing it today
[30:39] it's the same thing
[30:41] right
[30:42] so brother branham began to see himself
[30:44] in the scripture brother branham began
[30:46] to see the hour that he's living in
[30:48] reflected in the scripture
[30:51] amen
[30:52] so as brother solomon said there's
[30:54] nothing new under the sun
[30:56] the very hour that we live in has been
[30:58] reflected in this bible
[31:00] amen
[31:02] ahab was a king in israel
[31:04] brother brown said the history of israel
[31:06] is happening again right here in the
[31:07] united states
[31:09] israel had ahab israel had it jezebel
[31:12] israel had in elijah
[31:14] america's got the same thing
[31:16] ahab had three wars with syria
[31:19] and he was killed in the third one
[31:21] the united states has had three main
[31:23] wars is that right in between the second
[31:26] world war and the third world war elijah
[31:29] comes
[31:30] and you read that in first kings chapter
[31:32] 20 22
[31:34] right in between the second syrian
[31:35] campaign and the third syrian campaign
[31:37] elijah comes right in between there
[31:40] exactly the way it's happened here in
[31:41] the united states
[31:42] is that right
[31:43] remember what president brother branham
[31:45] compared to ahab
[31:47] john f kennedy
[31:49] ahab was shot right in his chariot
[31:52] john f kennedy was shot right in his
[31:54] chariot
[31:55] it's a perfect reflection of the
[31:57] scripture
[31:58] so there truly is nothing new under the
[32:00] sun
[32:01] everything that we're living in right
[32:02] now has already been shown to us in the
[32:04] bible
[32:05] that's why you got to be in that word
[32:07] constantly to know where you're at and
[32:09] what's going on
[32:12] brother brown said i sure love good
[32:14] singing
[32:15] but the greatest thing that i have for
[32:17] pleasure is meditation in the word of
[32:19] god
[32:21] huh
[32:22] that's right
[32:23] all right amen you're supposed to come
[32:25] to a place in the lord where it is a
[32:27] pleasure to meditate in the word of god
[32:30] that's food for the soul
[32:32] amen
[32:34] you know when you're feeding on the word
[32:35] of god you're just feeding on the same
[32:37] substance that your soul was made of
[32:39] are we taught that our soul is an
[32:40] attribute of god a thought expressed
[32:44] right and we live by dead substance you
[32:46] have to eat food that comes from the
[32:48] ground and your body came from the
[32:49] ground
[32:50] well in order for your soul to live and
[32:52] be sustained you have to eat the same
[32:54] thing that your soul's made of
[32:56] if you're predestinated see the god your
[32:58] soul's made of the word of god
[33:00] so you have to feed on the word of god
[33:02] to be sustained
[33:04] amen that's where you know do you
[33:06] understand who who's who and what's what
[33:08] how to eat what they feed on
[33:11] shows their character
[33:13] that's right
[33:14] you feed on the things of the world
[33:16] you're of the world glory feed on the
[33:18] things from heaven you're of heaven
[33:21] that's right
[33:22] that's pretty straight
[33:24] praise god for the truth
[33:27] amen i had that strain in my family i
[33:29] think it comes from my mom's side i just
[33:31] tell the truth if it makes grandma mad
[33:32] and just
[33:34] have to tell it
[33:39] and so i don't do it just to be spiteful
[33:41] it's just a habit it just comes out
[33:44] praise the lord we're going to look at
[33:46] something today that floored me in one
[33:49] of our last quotes but let's go ahead to
[33:51] uh
[33:52] that next quote identification there
[33:54] around paragraph
[33:57] two
[33:58] let's start at 238
[34:01] moses had to stoop from a throne to take
[34:04] the word of god
[34:06] he forsook a throne
[34:08] that's right he was heir to a throne
[34:12] and he forsook the pleasures of being
[34:14] pharaoh
[34:15] for he esteemed the reproach
[34:17] of christ greater riches than the
[34:18] treasures of egypt amen
[34:21] you say well i tell you the woman will
[34:23] all laugh at me
[34:25] the men will think i don't care what
[34:27] they think that's right paul stooped
[34:29] moses stooped from a throne i got a line
[34:32] of them wrote down here to take three
[34:33] pages but
[34:34] let me tell you something help you right
[34:36] quick jesus stooped from heaven thank
[34:38] god he did
[34:40] to reflect himself in the form of sinful
[34:42] flesh and who are you and who or i
[34:46] to make
[34:47] make a way for us to reflect god
[34:50] jesus christ stooped from heaven to make
[34:53] a way for us to reflect god
[34:56] he opened up a way
[34:58] divine communication by inspiration
[35:00] right
[35:01] see
[35:02] a way for us to reflect god to make a
[35:04] way to reflect himself in us
[35:08] by sanctifying us to his word
[35:11] glory to god
[35:13] who praised god
[35:15] i like it rubbing elbows with people
[35:16] that think about the word talk about the
[35:18] word amen
[35:20] for this word says that when he did so
[35:23] so that we could reflect his word
[35:26] first john 14 12 he said he that
[35:27] believeth on me the works that i do
[35:28] shall he do also why it was christ
[35:31] reflect a little while in the world
[35:33] won't see me no more yet you'll see me
[35:35] for i
[35:36] personal pronoun be with you even in you
[35:40] oh my
[35:41] it's christ in the people causing them
[35:43] to live by the scriptures for this day
[35:46] christ in flesh
[35:48] amen
[35:50] even in you see all the end of the world
[35:52] oh if any will follow me let him deny
[35:55] himself let him deny his man-made creed
[35:57] pick up his bible and follow me that's
[35:59] right yes sir then you are identified
[36:02] somewhere
[36:03] in scripture
[36:05] no doubt i'll have to close you're
[36:08] identified somewhere in the scripture
[36:09] you know that each one of us were
[36:11] identified amen amen
[36:14] amen the unveiling of god
[36:16] that next quote
[36:17] this is this is a good word
[36:20] brothers sisters
[36:22] recognizing
[36:24] realizing having the holy ghost bearing
[36:26] record to you of your position in christ
[36:30] is connected to rapturing faith
[36:33] amen the revelation of this hour
[36:36] is that you're at the end time
[36:38] right and you're right at the time god's
[36:40] going to close the door on the gentiles
[36:41] and go back to israel
[36:43] that's the time you're living in
[36:45] but at that time he brings a bride to
[36:47] such perfection in christ that jesus has
[36:50] the oversight the preeminence and the
[36:52] leading in her
[36:54] that he's able to change him in atoms
[36:56] and catch them away
[36:58] in genesis 49 10 we read last night when
[37:01] shiloh comes unto him will the gathering
[37:04] of the people be
[37:06] there's going to be a gathering yet but
[37:08] it's a resurrection right and a
[37:10] translation and we'll be gathered
[37:11] together to meet him in the air
[37:13] is that right brother braham taught us
[37:15] that when the resurrection sets in we
[37:17] all get together first
[37:20] brother it says watch the wisdom of the
[37:22] lord
[37:23] he lets us get together first so we see
[37:25] you know who's who and what's what and
[37:27] then when we ascend up to meet the lord
[37:29] in the air we're not looking at each
[37:30] other we're not looking to our side
[37:32] we're looking at jesus because brother
[37:33] brandon said it'll be a perfect worship
[37:36] that's right the bible says the
[37:38] gathering will be unto him
[37:40] that's the gathering we want
[37:43] amen onto jesus
[37:45] amen the holy ghost takes us there
[37:49] we're gathered together in these small
[37:51] amateur ways to gather unto christ we
[37:53] come together today in his name observe
[37:56] his word and his revelation for this
[37:57] hour but this is just a reflection of a
[37:59] greater gathering
[38:01] an hour that we're living for amen
[38:03] that's the gathering we want
[38:06] then we want to make ready for amen
[38:08] now brother braham says
[38:10] we're inside of christ
[38:13] now as then all true believers see him
[38:17] the word of promise of this day openly
[38:20] manifested
[38:23] the word of promise this day openly
[38:26] manifested that's a big word if you can
[38:28] get it see
[38:30] all true believers that's in the word
[38:34] see god openly gloria
[38:37] excuse me
[38:39] praise be to god
[38:42] my prayer my precious brothers sisters
[38:44] is the holy ghost the sweet holy spirit
[38:47] of god's anointing and so come upon each
[38:49] and every one of our lives that the word
[38:51] will open to us in such a way that we'll
[38:54] begin to see our true identification in
[38:56] the word amen to see exactly who we are
[38:59] in christ
[39:00] and live in that spot
[39:02] we can't make ourselves that has to be
[39:04] his spirit that does it
[39:06] but if his spirit is doing it recognize
[39:08] it
[39:09] amen profess it speak it
[39:12] amen jesus did brother branham did
[39:16] he put it a lot of times an allegorian
[39:18] story for him but you know he's talking
[39:19] about it
[39:21] is that right
[39:22] when he's saying abraham
[39:25] a-b-r-h-a-m graham six letters
[39:28] he never does mention bran him seven
[39:30] letters but you know your thought went
[39:32] there
[39:33] trying to lead you right up to it so you
[39:34] don't have to say it right
[39:36] amen jesus did those kinds of things
[39:40] say things without saying them
[39:43] huh
[39:44] that's right
[39:46] that's how that's how you hide you know
[39:48] you know what i'm trying to say that's
[39:49] that's where the lovers live over there
[39:52] you know what i'm saying
[39:54] that unspoken language that roundabout
[39:56] kind of language
[39:58] huh jesus has a way of communicating
[40:00] things to people
[40:01] amen amen
[40:03] so brother brandon reflected that wisdom
[40:05] of the lord and he taught the word and
[40:07] that's with the problem with so many
[40:08] people
[40:09] they have these quotes fighting quotes
[40:11] but the holy ghost is going to make it
[40:13] run in all continuity
[40:16] that's the way it is
[40:18] you can't file the letter of the bible
[40:20] the scriptures paul said
[40:22] the the letter kills lets the spirit
[40:24] give his life
[40:26] well you know you've seen the letter
[40:27] this message killed a bunch of people
[40:30] huh
[40:31] brothers drawing swords on brothers and
[40:32] fighting they all got their quotes for
[40:34] everything they believe
[40:36] instead of working for continuity they
[40:37] just gonna pitch a tent and camp on
[40:40] their little doctrine
[40:41] instead of seeing the whole picture come
[40:44] together
[40:45] brother brandon says you can't use just
[40:46] one scripture to prove anything it must
[40:48] lay in the continuity of the whole bible
[40:51] amen
[40:52] that's the way it is with the message
[40:54] from 47-65
[40:56] and that's why we're so blessed to have
[40:57] it on a computer that you can search it
[40:59] out
[41:01] praise god
[41:02] i don't mean to get all preachy but i
[41:04] had a pastor in st louis and a dear
[41:06] saint of god i love him with all my
[41:07] heart
[41:08] and i still think about him and honor
[41:10] him today
[41:11] but he had an idea that just wasn't
[41:13] exactly right
[41:15] he believed that
[41:17] that the joshua ministry was one man
[41:19] coming to lead the bride
[41:22] well whenever i got to hold the table
[41:23] and start studying the messages for
[41:25] myself i found out my dear old pastor
[41:27] had it wrong
[41:28] that's the wrong idea ain't a one-man
[41:31] ministry no more it's a body ministry
[41:34] amen
[41:35] that one man ministry ceased when god
[41:37] took his profit home
[41:39] brother branham introduced the fullness
[41:41] of the word and it's christ incarnated
[41:43] himself in his endtime bride
[41:46] that's what it is
[41:48] everybody sees revelations 10 1-7 but
[41:50] they don't want to see 8-11
[41:53] huh
[41:54] there's a word-born bride
[41:57] a word walking in shoe leather
[42:00] they might be few and far between but
[42:02] it's a reality she's here
[42:05] the bride coming of christ
[42:07] everything like this
[42:09] but the joshua ministry my dear pastor
[42:13] i learned an awful lot from him but he
[42:15] didn't have the uh
[42:17] the table back then this was years ago
[42:18] before the table ever came out
[42:21] but uh i'm just saying this as an
[42:22] example how people can just take certain
[42:25] parts of the message because you got to
[42:27] be careful you have to consider
[42:28] everything brother brahms said about a
[42:30] certain subject
[42:32] so that's why it takes time to just kind
[42:34] of settle down and be focused and
[42:36] careful and and thank god for good
[42:39] pastor brothers and elders in this word
[42:41] that really sit down and situate things
[42:44] and rightly divide the word
[42:46] amen we can't add to it or take away
[42:48] from it but it must be rightly divided
[42:50] amen
[42:52] praise god i appreciate that
[42:54] but thank god for the word today amen i
[42:58] thank god for the way that the lord has
[43:00] opened up these scriptures and let us
[43:02] see our true identification
[43:04] so let us see who we are amen
[43:07] now
[43:09] there's so many great things that god
[43:11] has done to let us see this kind of
[43:14] reflection
[43:15] this hour that we live in
[43:18] brother branham took
[43:19] things like for example in desperation
[43:22] he took a passage from jeremiah chapter
[43:25] 29
[43:26] where god was telling him that even
[43:28] though you're going to go underway
[43:30] captivity for 70 years i'm going to
[43:32] bring you back into this land
[43:35] and then at the end of the sentence
[43:36] brother branham says see back to
[43:38] pentecost
[43:39] it doesn't say that but that's what i
[43:41] mean to the church
[43:43] right so brother brown was using that
[43:46] passage in jeremiah to show
[43:49] that just like israel was carried away
[43:51] into captivity the church was carried
[43:53] away into mystery babylon
[43:56] for seven church ages
[43:58] 70 decades or seven decades
[44:02] 70 years is seven decades
[44:04] and israel was in babylon for 70 years
[44:07] so the church was carried away into
[44:09] mystery babylon for seven church ages
[44:11] but after the seven church ages god
[44:14] brings them back into the land of their
[44:15] fathers
[44:16] this is what brother branham was
[44:18] pointing to
[44:19] so in the bible you take these old
[44:21] testament books and you make yourself
[44:24] familiar with
[44:26] what
[44:27] time the book was written respective to
[44:29] that 70-year captivity and so much opens
[44:33] up the book of ezra in the book of
[44:35] nehemiah is specifically for people like
[44:37] you
[44:38] read the book of nehemiah and you'll see
[44:40] yourself right there right the book of
[44:43] ezra
[44:44] brother brown preached the blessing
[44:45] prophet
[44:46] from ezra
[44:47] amen
[44:49] the book of nehemiah and the book of
[44:50] ezra are restoration books
[44:52] they're the time the history of israel
[44:55] when they come back into the land after
[44:57] the captivity
[44:59] and you and i have been brought back
[45:00] into the land of our apostolic fathers
[45:02] after the babylonian captivity
[45:05] so you know what's happened in the book
[45:06] of nehemiah
[45:07] nehemiah says the lord my god put it
[45:09] upon my heart to take
[45:12] a numbering of the people a reckoning of
[45:15] the people by genealogy
[45:18] so after the captivity there's a book a
[45:20] record brought out
[45:22] and opened up so the people can trace
[45:25] their genealogy
[45:26] amen that's right
[45:28] and there were people that were found in
[45:31] the book
[45:34] that's right
[45:36] but there were people that took on
[45:38] another name
[45:39] and there they they married often to
[45:41] other nations and took on their name so
[45:43] they were polluted from the registry
[45:47] those blasphemous names brother graham
[45:50] talked about right we're not surprised
[45:52] to be called by no other name but jesus
[45:53] christ
[45:54] amen glory so when you read those books
[45:57] of nehemiah
[46:00] ezra
[46:01] those things like that
[46:02] remember i'm just trying to give you a
[46:04] little key here a little tip make
[46:06] yourself familiar with which old
[46:07] testament book was written before the
[46:11] the
[46:12] captivity
[46:13] during the captivity like daniel and
[46:15] ezekiel
[46:16] and even jeremiah was prophesying while
[46:18] they was being taken away
[46:20] jeremiah daniel and ezekiel and then the
[46:22] books after the captivity right
[46:25] the bible's perfect
[46:28] absolutely perfect
[46:30] and our our precious heavenly father
[46:33] sent us this ministry in the last days
[46:35] to dovetail all scripture
[46:37] to see our true identification in the
[46:39] word amen
[46:42] see there you are identified somewhere
[46:44] in the scripture
[46:46] praise god
[46:48] now on the unveiling of god
[46:51] another quote here i mean the message is
[46:53] full of it's amazing brother wade
[46:55] whenever the lord opens your eyes about
[46:56] something it's just like the beginning
[46:58] of it
[46:59] it's like a floodgate then after a while
[47:01] that's all you can see every time i turn
[47:03] on the message and listen to something i
[47:04] see the same thing over and over again
[47:06] praise god
[47:08] that's the holy ghost
[47:10] in the unveiling of god it says as it is
[47:12] written
[47:14] written you are written epistles the
[47:15] bible said now what is an epistle it is
[47:18] a written word
[47:20] and you are the written see in other
[47:22] words you'd read it like this
[47:25] he said you are written epistles
[47:27] or you are the word that has been
[47:30] written made manifest
[47:34] nothing can be added to it you can't say
[47:36] i'm a written epistle and live some
[47:38] other kind of something but what this
[47:40] has already wrote
[47:42] brother brandon passes by see because
[47:44] nothing can be added or taken away right
[47:47] praise god brothers and sisters
[47:49] i just want to stand here today and
[47:50] encourage each and every one of you to
[47:52] keep searching keep digging diligently
[47:54] in this word until you find yourself in
[47:56] the word
[47:57] brother brandon said if you're in christ
[47:59] you're in this word
[48:01] amen
[48:02] now you heard the story about two
[48:04] brothers listening to a message and one
[48:06] comes out and says man i don't know if i
[48:07] like that tonight he called me a buzzard
[48:09] and the other brother said well
[48:11] sorry about that he called me an eagle
[48:13] right
[48:13] it depends on how you hear it right
[48:15] they meant him
[48:17] amen
[48:19] amen
[48:21] the next quote in for 114 mighty god
[48:24] unveiled in paragraph 114
[48:27] moses veil he was the living word to the
[48:30] people amen
[48:32] see how many understands that
[48:34] i'm sure you do as message people
[48:36] i'm not afraid to say it william miriam
[48:39] branham his life in ministry is a
[48:41] fulfillment of scripture
[48:43] he was written he was written in this
[48:45] word
[48:46] amen
[48:48] you can take it to so many different
[48:49] places samuel
[48:51] lazar
[48:52] right
[48:53] brother branham's lazar who's rebecca
[48:57] yeah right you
[48:59] what was illegal's job to take rebecca
[49:01] to isaac right right amen
[49:04] that's right
[49:07] i've been taking isaac
[49:09] amen
[49:10] i've been escorted
[49:12] praise the lord
[49:14] let me take you into that secret place
[49:17] amen with the husband of my soul
[49:19] praise the lord amen
[49:22] it's amazing message we have today
[49:26] how awesome the scriptures have opened
[49:28] to us in these last days
[49:30] when our precious lord jesus after his
[49:32] resurrection
[49:34] was walking with the two to emmaus
[49:37] he expounded the scriptures to them
[49:39] amen
[49:40] and it's after brother branham operates
[49:42] that gift the sign of the messiah to
[49:45] prove that jesus christ is alive he's
[49:48] resurrected the sign of the resurrection
[49:51] the second pool right first pool healing
[49:54] second pull prophecy
[49:55] revealing the secrets of men's hearts
[49:57] that's the sign of the messiah then the
[49:59] third pulls the opening of the word
[50:02] after jesus resurrected
[50:04] he was fellowshipping with two disciples
[50:06] in the evening time
[50:08] amen and opened the word to him
[50:11] is that right so after jesus proved he
[50:13] was alive vindicated the prophet
[50:16] gave public proof
[50:19] that brother branham had the authority
[50:21] to interpret scripture
[50:23] amen
[50:24] and their interpretation just ain't some
[50:26] fandangled idea it's word upon word
[50:29] line upon line preset upon precept
[50:33] absolutely perfect
[50:35] amen
[50:37] so
[50:38] we see the opening of the word and how
[50:41] what it means to us the influence of the
[50:42] spoken word
[50:44] the influence of it upon our lives and
[50:46] the impact of it
[50:48] get into that place where it's
[50:49] influencing the way you think
[50:51] come under the headship of it
[50:53] coming to that place where it's
[50:55] inspiring you and moving in your life
[50:58] don't ignore it don't let your life get
[50:59] so covered about where you're not
[51:00] spending time in that secret place with
[51:03] the lord
[51:04] amen
[51:06] see
[51:07] and today the people that are veiled are
[51:09] the same thing they are written epistles
[51:12] read of all men not a new epistle but
[51:14] the epistle that's been written right
[51:16] now amen
[51:19] we don't need nothing new
[51:21] we just need what has been written
[51:23] but we need what has been written to be
[51:24] made manifest in our flesh
[51:27] amen
[51:29] because you know as well as i do that
[51:31] this very hour that we live in has
[51:33] already been recorded in scripture
[51:35] is that right
[51:37] and we can get specific
[51:39] there's specific things written in here
[51:41] that pertains to you and i
[51:43] amen
[51:45] that's been written made manifest
[51:47] not a new epistle but the epistle that's
[51:49] been written made manifest
[51:51] see it's those who believe the word and
[51:54] the promise of this day that god is
[51:56] pouring out a spirit
[51:59] upon all flesh excuse me
[52:01] and that is written epistles amen
[52:05] and when a person tries to carnally
[52:07] impersonate that it backfires
[52:09] your life shows what you are
[52:11] amen that's the truth
[52:14] praise god but that holy ghost in every
[52:17] age
[52:18] makes the person the true believer live
[52:20] the word for that age that's the work of
[52:22] the spirit
[52:24] you know what the false anointed ones
[52:26] are they have an anointing or the true
[52:28] holy ghost but they're off the word
[52:29] right so what's a true anointing
[52:32] a true anointing is when the holy ghost
[52:34] comes upon the seed of god and makes
[52:35] them live the word they can't help it
[52:38] they're just doing what they're of
[52:41] the nature that they're of it's
[52:42] reflected in their life because the
[52:44] spirit of god quickens the word to their
[52:45] heart
[52:46] amen
[52:48] because we're anointed with that ego
[52:50] anointing we can't help but see what we
[52:51] see
[52:53] hey don't blame me
[52:55] we're just anointed to it right that's
[52:57] right
[52:59] people of the world the globalist and
[53:00] the antichrist they're anointed that way
[53:03] amen we're anointed this way to walk in
[53:06] the steps of our father
[53:08] to follow the word the way he filed the
[53:10] word to have the same convictions he had
[53:13] amen
[53:14] to live by the word of god now the
[53:16] easter seal
[53:18] paragraph 237
[53:20] brother brown makes it super plain in
[53:22] these quotes right here
[53:24] now precious brothers and sisters what
[53:25] we need is
[53:28] for god
[53:30] to make it so real to us individually
[53:33] to where you know what's written of you
[53:37] and i can't give it to you your church
[53:38] can't give it to you it's only by the
[53:40] holy ghost quickening it to you as our
[53:42] precious brother quoted last night when
[53:44] he got in the pulpit yesterday
[53:46] and the holy ghost is the only revealer
[53:49] of the word
[53:51] huh now people like to think they can
[53:53] just join church and by mere association
[53:56] be okay it don't work that way
[53:58] you have to have personal identification
[54:00] with jesus
[54:02] amen
[54:04] so jesus remember our scripture in
[54:06] ephesians hath quickened us together and
[54:10] seated us in heavenly places in christ
[54:12] jesus we're quick into this
[54:14] the spirit of god quickens us and orders
[54:17] our steps in the word
[54:19] amen
[54:20] brother braham said
[54:22] everything happens for a reason
[54:24] amen
[54:26] we wonder why we end up where we are and
[54:28] everything like this the holy ghost is
[54:30] ordering our steps
[54:32] see
[54:33] so jesus
[54:35] so full of this quickening power said if
[54:37] you can destroy this temple that took
[54:39] you 40 years you thought to build i'll
[54:42] raise it up in three days
[54:43] now this is where i love it right here
[54:45] why
[54:47] why could jesus say that right
[54:50] this is where we're living today because
[54:52] god opened up this word to us
[54:54] and this is where i'm connecting this
[54:56] authority to translate without death
[54:58] because it's written of you
[55:00] this is where you can rest ashore
[55:03] is that simple enough
[55:05] clear enough
[55:06] people wonder how rapturing faith comes
[55:08] today this is it right here
[55:10] because the person realizes it's written
[55:13] of them
[55:14] jesus realized that in his day brother
[55:16] branham realized it in his day and the
[55:18] pride realizes in her day
[55:20] it's written of her
[55:22] amen the holy ghost moved on brother
[55:25] brown said pick up your pen and write
[55:27] here's the secret of it the word is in
[55:30] the bride
[55:32] amen he shows her his word she receives
[55:36] it she never doubts it right and she
[55:38] being the wife to the husband she knows
[55:41] what he wants done with the word amen
[55:43] amen
[55:45] praise god that's continuity
[55:48] that's that's being connected
[55:50] amen
[55:51] praise god i remember one time i was
[55:52] working in the backyard all day and man
[55:55] it was on my heart to have chili for
[55:57] supper
[55:58] man i wish i had me a big old pot of
[56:00] chili i walked in the back door and
[56:01] danielle said honey i think we're going
[56:03] to have chili tonight i said praise god
[56:05] you're in the right spirit sister
[56:08] huh
[56:09] she's following headship
[56:12] amen
[56:13] that's right
[56:14] that's the way it is
[56:16] amen
[56:17] huh
[56:18] that's awesome ain't it
[56:20] that's the way it is between the wife
[56:22] and the husband
[56:23] that's the kind of fellowship and the
[56:24] unity and the agreement christ has with
[56:26] his bride
[56:27] amen i love that the bride of jesus
[56:31] christ just can't help but she agrees
[56:33] with the husband
[56:35] amen
[56:37] i agree with my husband christ the word
[56:40] there's just something about it i can't
[56:42] help it whenever i hear the voice i say
[56:44] amen
[56:45] whether or not i can understand it or
[56:47] not i say amen because there's something
[56:49] to it but you find out as you stay with
[56:51] it the lord is always going to bring you
[56:53] to the understanding
[56:54] amen
[56:56] it's okay i guess you know you say to
[56:59] the youngins you know you don't have to
[57:00] understand it you just have to believe
[57:02] it and that's true
[57:03] that's true to a certain extent but
[57:05] brother braham said a true ego will
[57:06] understand the message
[57:08] because it's the voice of the bridegroom
[57:11] amen
[57:12] but why
[57:14] why could jesus say that
[57:16] huh
[57:17] how in the world
[57:19] could people in this last day ever
[57:21] declare
[57:23] that they're going to be changing in
[57:24] atoms
[57:26] huh
[57:27] you were singing it yesterday to body
[57:29] change where's all that come from
[57:32] right out of the scripture
[57:34] it's in the bible
[57:35] glory the revelation is and it's so it's
[57:38] so amazing to me my brothers that
[57:40] there's people that don't even see that
[57:42] the rapture is scriptural right
[57:44] huh all right
[57:46] but it's it's it's
[57:48] it's a mystery that's been hidden
[57:51] but it's a it's a mystery that's been
[57:52] revealed to the bride
[57:54] brother brown said the rapture is a
[57:56] revelation to the bride
[57:58] amen
[57:59] it sure is that's true
[58:02] now i don't spiritualize everything i
[58:03] believe in a literal body change
[58:06] that's right amen but there is a
[58:09] revelation that catches you up into
[58:11] heavenly atmosphere pending the body
[58:14] change
[58:15] and that's one of the things that lets
[58:16] you know
[58:17] that you're going to change into atoms
[58:19] because you're already there
[58:21] in the power of the spirit quickened
[58:23] seated in heavenly places in christ
[58:25] jesus and the lord jesus christ is
[58:28] imparting these things to the members of
[58:31] his body
[58:33] why could jesus say that right that's
[58:36] probably where i should have started
[58:38] that's a good question
[58:40] i appreciate the way brother brown
[58:42] preaches things
[58:43] why could jesus say this
[58:45] the reason why he's asking a question is
[58:46] because he's trying to set you up to
[58:48] think about why
[58:49] jesus can make such a declaration right
[58:53] because he knew
[58:54] amen
[58:56] i want want to ask you why could jesus
[58:58] say a thing like that
[59:00] he knew
[59:02] that he was
[59:05] amen
[59:06] right now this is where
[59:08] going to church christian fellowship
[59:10] standing in the message is so important
[59:12] because you're living in a time where
[59:14] god has done something that he's never
[59:16] done in no other church age he's letting
[59:18] the end time people know
[59:21] point of fact what's written of them
[59:24] luther couldn't know it like this
[59:26] he knew a great deal of things he knew
[59:28] enough to to bring about a reformation
[59:31] man it always astounds me that little
[59:33] message of justification how it shook
[59:35] the world
[59:36] brought a reformation if that much truth
[59:38] or god's word could do that then what
[59:40] can all this truth do now
[59:42] huh
[59:43] that antichrist don't stand a chance
[59:45] against this anointed bride
[59:47] brother brown said she will not spoil
[59:50] her skirts
[59:51] glory this word has got everything it
[59:53] needs to keep the end time bride i
[59:55] believe that with all my heart
[59:58] take the world but give me jesus give me
[1:00:01] that revealed word give me that word
[1:00:03] made manifest in these last days
[1:00:06] show me the identification of the
[1:00:07] manifestation of christ in this hour
[1:00:10] open up that word speak it
[1:00:12] right
[1:00:14] huh
[1:00:16] isaiah said if they speak not according
[1:00:17] to this word there's no light in them
[1:00:19] right is that right
[1:00:22] i want to i want
[1:00:23] everybody that claims to believe this
[1:00:25] message
[1:00:26] to be able to truly and clearly by
[1:00:29] revelation of the holy ghost identify
[1:00:31] what scripture is being applied to this
[1:00:33] hour
[1:00:34] you're supposed to have this
[1:00:35] consciousness in this reality in this
[1:00:37] time you're supposed to know
[1:00:41] unknowing has been given to us
[1:00:44] let's go to first corinthians let's read
[1:00:45] something that just comes upon
[1:00:47] my heart right now
[1:00:50] first corinthians chapter two
[1:00:53] a knowing
[1:00:58] praise god brother
[1:00:59] my brothers and sisters the lord jesus
[1:01:01] has done away with denominational
[1:01:02] guesswork
[1:01:04] i ain't guessing on nothing
[1:01:06] we don't guess we're saved
[1:01:10] we don't guess we're healed
[1:01:12] we know we are
[1:01:13] we don't get i guess i'm born again you
[1:01:16] better get something better than that
[1:01:19] you better know you've passed from death
[1:01:20] unto life
[1:01:22] but what the apostle paul says in first
[1:01:24] corinthians chapter 2
[1:01:26] and verse 6.
[1:01:30] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:01:33] that are perfect
[1:01:34] and that capstone right there right when
[1:01:36] that which is perfect just come that
[1:01:38] which is in part is done away
[1:01:40] amen i believe we've got a perfect word
[1:01:41] today amen
[1:01:44] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[1:01:46] the princes of this world that come to
[1:01:48] nothing
[1:01:49] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[1:01:51] mystery amen but we speak
[1:01:55] spoken word the mystery of god because
[1:01:57] the mystery of god's hid
[1:01:59] in the written word
[1:02:01] but we speak it
[1:02:03] and it's revealed the spoken word
[1:02:05] unlocks the mystery that's contained in
[1:02:07] the scripture
[1:02:09] that's right
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:11] that's why the message is so important
[1:02:12] amen amen and you come into that place
[1:02:15] and align yourself and line your soul
[1:02:18] spirit and body with that revealed word
[1:02:20] you're brought into speaking conditions
[1:02:22] yourself
[1:02:24] the apostles on the day of pentecost was
[1:02:26] brought into speaking conditions
[1:02:30] i believe with all my heart this end
[1:02:32] time bride is in speaking conditions
[1:02:34] she's the final voice to the final age
[1:02:36] under her messenger
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:40] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[1:02:42] mystery even the hidden wisdom
[1:02:45] it was hid
[1:02:49] which god ordained before the world unto
[1:02:52] our
[1:02:53] oh
[1:02:54] amen god hid it on purpose
[1:02:56] god hid it for us
[1:02:59] for our glory right now amen
[1:03:02] god hid things in this word
[1:03:05] for you to make discoveries
[1:03:07] i'm just going to preach it to you honey
[1:03:09] you yourself
[1:03:12] you come to church brother gets inspired
[1:03:14] you hear things and you pick things up
[1:03:15] but you and your personal private life
[1:03:17] god wants to deal with you you get in
[1:03:20] your prayer closet you open up that word
[1:03:22] and let the holy spirit open things up
[1:03:23] to you personally
[1:03:26] here's how it'll happen many times
[1:03:28] you'll be in your life doing whatever it
[1:03:31] is you do in your home riding in your
[1:03:32] car
[1:03:33] listening reading meditating on the lord
[1:03:36] and something will come to you something
[1:03:38] to open up to you right you hold that in
[1:03:40] your heart
[1:03:41] then you
[1:03:42] like an obedient child go on to church
[1:03:45] when the church door is open
[1:03:47] you come in you sit down the holy ghost
[1:03:49] starts moving
[1:03:51] the song service comes to an end prayer
[1:03:53] service is given then the minister comes
[1:03:55] to the platform and i'll be if the holy
[1:03:57] ghost don't cause them to speak exactly
[1:03:59] what you've been meditating on
[1:04:01] huh
[1:04:02] that's continuity that's how the lord
[1:04:04] speaks
[1:04:06] that's why you got to be in your own
[1:04:08] personal private life
[1:04:09] seeking the lord because god will speak
[1:04:13] and that's how you know it's god
[1:04:16] listen don't take this for granted if
[1:04:18] you're sitting at your house and you're
[1:04:20] reading jeremiah chapter 10
[1:04:22] and something comes out of that passage
[1:04:24] and you're meditating on that and you're
[1:04:26] like well and then you go to church and
[1:04:28] the preacher takes his text from
[1:04:29] jeremiah chapter 10 don't say that's a
[1:04:31] coincidence
[1:04:33] that's not a coincidence
[1:04:36] come on be more spiritual than that
[1:04:38] there's a reason for everything
[1:04:40] that's why you should be paying
[1:04:42] attention
[1:04:43] pay attention to a service from
[1:04:45] beginning to end there is a reason
[1:04:47] certain songs are said there's a reason
[1:04:49] why the the brothers pray the way they
[1:04:51] pray there's a reason why the texts are
[1:04:53] read the ministry is speaking the way it
[1:04:56] is there's a reason for it
[1:04:58] all week long you should be being
[1:05:00] prepared by the holy spirit for the next
[1:05:02] service
[1:05:04] to be able to glean and receive what
[1:05:06] god's saying that's how you get built up
[1:05:09] that's how you get strengthened right
[1:05:11] huh
[1:05:12] that's right
[1:05:13] amen you're not going to get it watching
[1:05:15] oprah winfrey
[1:05:16] you're not going to get it reading
[1:05:18] worldly magazines a sports illustrated
[1:05:20] or whatever else holy ghost inspiration
[1:05:23] don't flow through those things
[1:05:25] huh
[1:05:26] everybody needs a little distraction but
[1:05:27] don't be so distracted you ain't paying
[1:05:29] attention to what the spirit says
[1:05:31] huh
[1:05:33] i've got a little recreation i go the
[1:05:34] shooting range and everything carry on
[1:05:36] but praise god i've got to get in my
[1:05:38] prayer closet
[1:05:39] find out what the spirit of god's
[1:05:41] speaking
[1:05:42] amen that's the way it is that's how it
[1:05:45] is in a cr like christian's life anyway
[1:05:47] right
[1:05:48] that's right the holy ghost speaking
[1:05:50] constantly
[1:05:51] the holy spirit is always speaking and
[1:05:53] the holy spirit is always willing to
[1:05:55] teach reveal open up the word and
[1:05:58] communicate things to you
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:01] praise god
[1:06:02] now in our passage here in verse 8
[1:06:06] which none of the princes of this world
[1:06:08] knew for had they known it they would
[1:06:10] not have crucified the lord of glory
[1:06:13] but as it is written i have not seen nor
[1:06:15] ear heard neither have entered into the
[1:06:16] heart of man the things which god hath
[1:06:18] prepared for them that love him
[1:06:20] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[1:06:23] his spirit
[1:06:25] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[1:06:27] the deep things of god
[1:06:29] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:06:31] except the spirit of man which is in him
[1:06:34] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:06:36] but the spirit of god
[1:06:38] so when a person has the spirit of god
[1:06:40] in their life they're going to know
[1:06:42] something right because it's the spirit
[1:06:44] of god that knows all things
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:48] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:06:50] the world verse 12 but the spirit which
[1:06:53] is of god that we might what
[1:06:58] people with the holy ghost know
[1:07:01] what the spirit of god is quickening in
[1:07:03] this hour isn't it the evidence of the
[1:07:05] holy ghost
[1:07:07] huh
[1:07:08] that's right
[1:07:10] people with the holy ghost know
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:13] brother brown said make no mistake about
[1:07:15] it
[1:07:16] a person that is truly baptized by the
[1:07:18] holy ghost into the body of christ
[1:07:21] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[1:07:23] will be in the word all the
[1:07:26] way that's right the holy ghost feeds on
[1:07:30] the
[1:07:31] that's right
[1:07:32] that's right praise god
[1:07:34] that's the truth i enjoyed that gloria
[1:07:37] praise the lord
[1:07:41] but why could jesus say that back to our
[1:07:43] quote
[1:07:44] brothers and sisters
[1:07:47] you understand the point that i'm trying
[1:07:49] to make quite simply
[1:07:50] what has happened my friends
[1:07:53] is that god has so opened up this word
[1:07:56] so sent the quickening power down
[1:07:58] revelations chapter 10 the angel of the
[1:08:00] lord come down
[1:08:02] the rainbow was around his head that's
[1:08:04] our king
[1:08:06] that quickening power was loosed at the
[1:08:08] opening of the seals that quickening
[1:08:10] power is coming to the bride to show her
[1:08:13] her place
[1:08:15] brother branham says in the seals when
[1:08:16] jesus comes off the seat and takes the
[1:08:18] book he opens the seals and he calls for
[1:08:21] his bride to take her place and her
[1:08:24] position at his side
[1:08:27] that's right
[1:08:29] and that's why
[1:08:31] you have this reflection in the book of
[1:08:33] esther
[1:08:35] she went to the king's throne to come to
[1:08:38] the king's throne right
[1:08:40] and the king put forth his scepter and
[1:08:42] she touched it
[1:08:44] right and that scepter is an emblem of
[1:08:46] his dominion his rule
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:50] so esther came to a place a position
[1:08:53] and began to exercise something as if it
[1:08:56] was the king himself
[1:09:00] right
[1:09:03] praise god knowing your place in your
[1:09:05] position right
[1:09:07] knowing what's written of you
[1:09:10] it has to become so personal to you the
[1:09:12] message has to become personal
[1:09:14] the opening of the word has to become
[1:09:16] something that's influencing you
[1:09:18] personally
[1:09:20] the opening of the seven seals has to
[1:09:22] have a personal effect on your life
[1:09:25] that's preaching but that's the way it
[1:09:27] is
[1:09:28] now
[1:09:29] uh
[1:09:31] why why could jesus say that
[1:09:34] i want to ask you why could jesus say a
[1:09:37] thing like that he knew that he was
[1:09:41] amen i wish i could make that stick he
[1:09:43] knew who he was
[1:09:45] he knew that every word god had wrote in
[1:09:48] there of him he had fulfilled it
[1:09:51] he knew he was the one david spoke of
[1:09:55] glory
[1:09:56] uh-oh
[1:09:57] do you know you're the ones the bible
[1:10:00] speaks of right
[1:10:02] that's where rapture and faith comes
[1:10:03] from
[1:10:04] that's what i'm telling you today that's
[1:10:06] how the people know they're going
[1:10:08] because it becomes a revelation it's
[1:10:10] written of them
[1:10:11] amen amen
[1:10:14] that's it right there
[1:10:16] praise god
[1:10:18] that's where i'm trying to live
[1:10:21] live in that understanding that place
[1:10:22] where the spirit of god quickens that
[1:10:24] word to let me know it's written of me
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:29] see
[1:10:30] now let's go on here
[1:10:33] paragraph uh
[1:10:34] do you know you're the ones the bible
[1:10:36] speaks of congress says amen do you know
[1:10:38] your position is in christ
[1:10:42] is that right
[1:10:43] now my precious brothers and sisters we
[1:10:45] know in the last 2000 years our precious
[1:10:47] lord jesus has been calling his elected
[1:10:50] bride
[1:10:51] out from the world system into himself
[1:10:54] right
[1:10:55] you say well praise god i'm in christ
[1:10:58] and that's absolutely incredible and
[1:11:01] important right
[1:11:02] but what i'm trying to just share with
[1:11:04] you is that we have it specifically we
[1:11:07] know what part of christ we're in amen
[1:11:10] amen we know that we're not a foot age
[1:11:13] we know where they're not a handy we're
[1:11:14] not even a mouth age the pentecostals
[1:11:17] are speaking in tongues
[1:11:19] and we're not even in the eye age no
[1:11:20] more brother branham was the seer
[1:11:23] we've passed that into the mind of
[1:11:24] christ the end time bride is clothed
[1:11:28] with the intelligence of the husband the
[1:11:29] mind of christ
[1:11:32] that's how she knows what he wants done
[1:11:33] with the word because she has the mind
[1:11:35] of the husband
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:38] see
[1:11:40] do you know your position is in christ
[1:11:43] but what part of christ is our position
[1:11:45] in
[1:11:46] right
[1:11:47] so we know it as an age we know it as an
[1:11:50] overall church
[1:11:51] but also as individuals some we were
[1:11:54] made to know right some of us are
[1:11:55] deacons some of us are pastors
[1:11:57] evangelists some of us are are
[1:11:59] housewives but that's our position in
[1:12:01] christ
[1:12:02] amen
[1:12:04] being a housewife can be just as
[1:12:05] important as anything else
[1:12:08] that's right if you're in christ being a
[1:12:10] housewife
[1:12:11] right
[1:12:13] if you're just a precious brother in the
[1:12:15] church and you have to be a mechanic as
[1:12:16] long as you're in christ you're a
[1:12:18] mechanic in christ
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:21] it's important there's a there's a
[1:12:22] position and a place for every member in
[1:12:25] the body
[1:12:26] and jesus said the least
[1:12:28] is greater amen
[1:12:31] so if you're in christ you're a new
[1:12:33] creature
[1:12:34] do you know this word is just like
[1:12:37] everyday living to you
[1:12:39] oh my
[1:12:40] meditating the word constantly my
[1:12:42] friends
[1:12:43] you need it more now than any other hour
[1:12:45] all kinds of deceiving spirits just
[1:12:47] chewing people up and spitting them out
[1:12:51] they don't even know how vindicated this
[1:12:53] message is and they're turning from it
[1:12:54] left and right amen
[1:12:56] see brother and says why sure it's yours
[1:13:00] he said this bible is yours
[1:13:03] it's a gift from god
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:06] that's right why sure it's yours you're
[1:13:08] an eagle that's your food amen
[1:13:11] paragraph 240.
[1:13:14] he said uh
[1:13:16] he knew that by the power of god he
[1:13:18] would do it because it was prophesied he
[1:13:20] would do it
[1:13:21] that's the reason he wasn't scared to
[1:13:23] say destroy this temple
[1:13:26] that's the reason he wasn't scared to
[1:13:28] say
[1:13:30] because he knew it was written of him
[1:13:33] that's right
[1:13:35] so let's just relax a man and think
[1:13:38] about this
[1:13:39] okay the lord jesus has children
[1:13:42] that come to this same knowing that he
[1:13:44] had right
[1:13:45] brother branham is an example of this
[1:13:48] but brother branham represents the
[1:13:49] overall bride
[1:13:51] enoch does too
[1:13:52] enact represents the translated bunch
[1:13:55] right
[1:13:55] so god will take one man let him
[1:13:57] represent a people
[1:13:58] he'll do to that one man what he's going
[1:14:00] to do to a people
[1:14:01] abraham and sarah turn back young again
[1:14:05] there's your representation right there
[1:14:07] amen
[1:14:08] so
[1:14:09] our precious brother
[1:14:12] branham
[1:14:13] was conscious of what was written of him
[1:14:16] so the end time bride is too
[1:14:20] the individuals
[1:14:21] come to that knowing
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] and this is where rapturing faith comes
[1:14:26] from
[1:14:28] okay
[1:14:29] so
[1:14:31] he knew
[1:14:32] by the power of god he would do it
[1:14:34] because it was prophesied he would do it
[1:14:38] amen amen
[1:14:40] that's the reason he wasn't scared to
[1:14:42] say destroy this temple i'll raise it up
[1:14:44] in three days because david said i'll
[1:14:47] not leave a soul in hell neither will i
[1:14:48] suffer my holy one to see corruption he
[1:14:51] knowed not one cell of his body would
[1:14:53] corrupt
[1:14:54] amen do you know there's no death for a
[1:14:57] christian
[1:14:58] that's right
[1:15:00] i i i've preached funerals of christians
[1:15:03] knowing in the holy ghost they wasn't
[1:15:05] dead right
[1:15:07] they just stepped right over into
[1:15:08] another dimension
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:11] it's a it's amazing
[1:15:14] i carried my holy ghost grandma i was a
[1:15:15] pallbearer at my grandma's funeral and i
[1:15:17] know she lived this message
[1:15:19] the holy ghost was living it right
[1:15:20] through her amen she had the pictures in
[1:15:23] her house whenever i was growing up
[1:15:25] and uh
[1:15:27] my grandma
[1:15:28] followed the message out of her heart
[1:15:30] and i just knew whenever i was carrying
[1:15:32] her body to that hole in the ground i
[1:15:34] knew grandma was over there in glory
[1:15:36] praise god and it's different when
[1:15:39] you're at a funeral like that i cried
[1:15:40] because i couldn't have fellowship with
[1:15:41] my grandma but there was joy in the
[1:15:43] midst of it
[1:15:45] people think you're crazy when you when
[1:15:46] you got that going on but
[1:15:48] praise god i had something i've been to
[1:15:50] funerals where i felt more joy than
[1:15:52] sorrow
[1:15:53] absolutely
[1:15:54] because i know what they lived and i
[1:15:56] know how the word lived through them now
[1:15:58] i'm almost to the point of envy
[1:16:01] that's right
[1:16:03] because they're over there
[1:16:05] no aches and pains
[1:16:08] not sweating it out in the heat
[1:16:10] praise god brother abraham said over
[1:16:12] there there's no way to be sorrowful
[1:16:16] no way to have any regrets
[1:16:19] that's right
[1:16:21] praise god for the truth amen
[1:16:23] amen that's the reason he wasn't scared
[1:16:25] to say destroy this temple i'll raise it
[1:16:27] up in three days because david said i'll
[1:16:29] not leave a soul hell neither well i
[1:16:31] suffer my holy one to see corruption he
[1:16:33] knowed not one cell his body would
[1:16:35] corrupt
[1:16:36] because it was written specifically
[1:16:39] the specifics was he had to come out
[1:16:41] before three days
[1:16:43] so within three days he had to come out
[1:16:45] of the grave because it was written
[1:16:47] specifically like that
[1:16:49] now brother brahma mentions one time
[1:16:51] about scriptural barricade
[1:16:53] a scriptural barricade god will not
[1:16:56] change his word for nothing no body
[1:16:59] if you go to thessalonians
[1:17:01] first thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:17:04] i'll show you an example of a scriptural
[1:17:06] barricade
[1:17:10] you think a preacher would know where
[1:17:11] thessalonians is
[1:17:18] first thessalonians chapter 4
[1:17:21] all right
[1:17:23] now
[1:17:24] the bible says in verse 16.
[1:17:31] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:17:34] heaven with a shout
[1:17:36] we know that's the message
[1:17:37] to do what gather the bride
[1:17:41] gather where in christ in shiloh in the
[1:17:44] mystery of the seventh seal
[1:17:46] to be quite frank with you this is the
[1:17:48] seventh seal
[1:17:50] the lord himself descended from heaven
[1:17:52] if you read verse 16 go to revelations
[1:17:54] chapter 10 it's the same thing
[1:17:56] it's not two different things it's the
[1:17:58] same thing
[1:17:59] i appreciate this church so much you can
[1:18:01] preach on the seventh seal and not get
[1:18:02] drove out of here
[1:18:03] praise god that's nice ain't it
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:10] that's the seventh seal right there
[1:18:12] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:18:14] heaven with a
[1:18:15] shout out that's the message
[1:18:18] and the seven seal sermon brother brown
[1:18:20] said did anybody think of that them
[1:18:21] angels coming to bring me the message
[1:18:25] so it's a shout here revelations 10 it's
[1:18:27] thunders
[1:18:28] matthew 25 it's a midnight cry
[1:18:31] right right
[1:18:32] same thing gathering the bride amen
[1:18:36] and it's the seven thunders that
[1:18:38] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:18:39] children back to the fathers exactly so
[1:18:42] all right
[1:18:42] so
[1:18:43] the voice of the archangel brother
[1:18:45] branstad was the resurrection
[1:18:47] so the lord descends from heaven with a
[1:18:49] shout
[1:18:50] and we're right now
[1:18:52] ready
[1:18:53] waiting for the resurrection
[1:18:55] right and in the trump of god
[1:18:59] and that's our ascension to the throne
[1:19:00] amen right
[1:19:02] and the dead in christ shall rise when
[1:19:04] first amen
[1:19:06] so guess what you're not going to change
[1:19:08] until then
[1:19:10] that's a scriptural barricade
[1:19:12] that's the way god does things
[1:19:15] that part has to be met first before the
[1:19:17] rest can be met
[1:19:19] right
[1:19:20] so then it says in verse 17 which is our
[1:19:24] verse this is where it's written of you
[1:19:26] my friends
[1:19:27] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:19:31] be caught up together but they rise
[1:19:33] first
[1:19:35] even brother brown put it like this in
[1:19:36] different ways but they rise first and
[1:19:39] then we're changed
[1:19:40] that's right so that's scripture
[1:19:43] that's a barricade
[1:19:44] right
[1:19:46] so whenever that part of the scripture
[1:19:48] is made up and fulfilled there is
[1:19:51] nothing to stop
[1:19:52] the quickening power of the spirit to
[1:19:55] quicken that part of the word in our
[1:19:56] lives
[1:19:57] glory to god
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:01] amen that's awesome
[1:20:03] i enjoyed that
[1:20:05] praise god
[1:20:06] that's the truth how many understands
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:10] that's the way it is
[1:20:12] then we which are alive and remain
[1:20:14] praise the lord so god bless you today
[1:20:16] my precious brothers and sisters i
[1:20:18] appreciate all that the lord has done
[1:20:20] for us in these last days quickening
[1:20:22] this to us

[1:20:26] fellowship is just absolutely wonderful
[1:20:27] to my heart amen living in the
[1:20:30] expectation of this part of the word
[1:20:33] that god is about to fulfill and bring
[1:20:35] to pass
[1:20:36] that tremendous victory in the love
[1:20:38] divine amen
[1:20:40] praise the lord i'm just so happy to

[1:20:45] grace in these last days
