========================================

I do one thing and like the devil Str something else it was one doctor told me he said I have a problem seeing images and different thing he put your problem is your eyes sending the wrong signal to your brain so it's it's it says it make me think that I'm seeing something that I'm not seeing things that I not see but I well right now I'm still able to drive and see how to do things like that it's just some of the stuff is I I I guess you call it depth perception I can reach to touch something it's still an inch way before I touch it but just keep trusting God and keep believing him him because it's it's things that we have we have no continuous City here we are seeking a city that it should come and so just let us find that and hold on to it we're going to read this morning from Psalm 139: 1- 11 let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you and we ask you to bless us Lord for this hour and time that we live God we want to understand and hold fast unto your word Lord whatever may come before us Lord let us know that you have made a way for us Lord we may have troubles but Lord still there's peace within you and God that's what we're seeking we ask you to help us and touch each

Lord amen I I want to say wasn't that a wonderful Sunday school lesson that I sure appreciated that it's it's good to hear stuff like that right there that that uh I just have to throw some roses out that was that was wonderful now uh y'all I just remember brother Wade and Louise going to uh Ministry at brother martins's this morning brother Ryan already mentioned that and uh and sister June doing well and I I saw the pictures and everything of the the little birthday party and everything so she that's wonderful to see her up and doing and and uh brother Ryan mentioned my dad so let me talk about my dad you know I I I I I I I mentioned on the little chat that my my dad had to my mom was out in the out in the yard and and uh she noticed that his his face side of his face was drooping and he wasn't able to respond to her questions and looked like something something was happening so she took him to the ER and you know everybody was real worried and everything but um we certainly thank everybody for your prayers what happened was when he got to the hospital you know that he wasn't able to answer the neurologist questions right and everything but um prayer got to working and something began to happen because the next day he he was fine they they did a MRA MRI and and I'm not just trying to you know exaggerate or nothing I they did an MRI and he they said that he had the brain of a 30-year-old they couldn't find any kind of evidence of a stroke or anything in his brain um they you know they're telling him you know he just needs to stay on some blood thinners and things but as far as you know that that's concerned everything looks fine and you know I think we've been we we've been seeing a lot of things lately God moving on the scene and testimonies and it sure is good to see evidence of Faith working and I sure I just I just can't thank God enough for his goodness to us amen amen so this morning I want to talk to you about will he find Faith because we've been kind of studying in Sunday school about faith and uh you know to think about that question will he find Faith so before we read in Luke 18: 1 to8 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to you Lord that to we to know that we have a a God that back that responds to our faith in you that you didn't just give us a word that'll fall to the ground and return void that you gave us a word a gospel that will do something and you promised us that it will accomplish his purpose Lord Jesus if we'll just let it fall into the ground of our heart it'll come up and it'll produce something it'll produce a change in our life it'll produce healing in our bodies it'll produce a sound mind and joy in our life Lord God and I pray Lord that you'll just Lord let your word go forth to your people and minister to whatever the needs that they have this morning Lord you know all of our needs Lord you know what we have need of Lord Jesus and I pray God that as the word is spoken that it'll be Lord you'll have Liberty Lord to Among Us and just build our faith up Lord to the place where we can believe the promises that you have given unto us that are laying here in this word Lord in this in this Bible that we all claim to believe Lord Jesus build up our faith we ask Grant it Lord as you just be with us this morning Lord Jesus be with all of your Saints be with the the brother Wade and brother Louise there ministering for Brother Martin Lord this morning I pray God that you'll give them a special outpouring a special blessing this morning Lord granted Lord that you just be with us Lord in this house we pray in your name amen now I'm I'm I'm going just try to take it slow this morning Amen in Luke 18 verse 1 to8 let's just meditate on these words as we read it says Jesus gave this little Parable and he spake a parable unto them to this end that that men ought always to pray and not to faint amen saying there was in City a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will aveng her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now you think about that this morning brother Bram said when when he was explaining this scripture he said that you know God's not looking for to see who who's coming to church or who's real religious and he kind of went down through the list of all the different things that what what God is looking for is Faith and to think about this morning that that if you really want to please God that just show him your faith let his let your faith be observable to God that that's that's the really the thing that make makes God happy when God speaks a word out and it falls into the good ground of your heart and you say I believe that I believe that and you see that's what the that's what we come to church for that's what we gather together to hear the preaching of the Gospel to stir up our faith to a place where we say you know what I I I do believe I believe that God cares about me I believe that I believe that these promises that he told I believe that there's healing that's laying in the Bible and I believe that this promise that God made is for me oh you see that's when when something when you really begin to lay home lay claim to God's promise something begins to work and you think about this this story that Jesus is explaining about this woman that that she something had happened to her in her life maybe maybe we'll say it like this maybe maybe just put it in present day maybe her Joy got stole maybe somebody stole stole some of her lands her possession something something maybe if we'll say maybe something that God had promised to her maybe some you know she she had a possession that that her that had been passed down through generations and that was hers and somebody come in and stole it from her and she had to go before the judge and she was saying it it was mine and somebody's stole it you got to pay you got you got to make it make this right and there was a in the story it's an unjust judge a judge that's sitting up there that doesn't know God and and doesn't doesn't know doesn't care about man doesn't care about maybe this little widow woman that's that's got this real problem but to think now that this widow woman that would come and would imp implore you've got to make this right that God is saying that if we'll come with that same kind of a confidence the same kind of a confidence coming to God if if if that unjust judge if that unjust judge would make it right just to get that woman away to make her go away what will God do to to to to somebody that comes with confidence that he's going to fulfill his promise with faith in his word how will God reward that you to think about that go Jesus was was telling us this story to stir up within us to stir up within us to to that we should have confidence to know that God will reward will reward our faith now is that what Paul was saying there in Hebrews 11 that that you you've got to have faith in God you've got to have faith that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you've got to have confidence that if you need something from God that he will reward you I I I want to say this morning maybe maybe somebody's maybe maybe you you aren't able to pay your bills you got to have confidence that God will come on the scene and and work a miracle in your life you got to have confidence that's the kind of faith that we can have oh you go back and listen to that first message that brother rown ever preached that faith is the substance and he laid it out how strong that faith faith if you really know what faith is faith will take an obstacle and move it out of the way faith if you got great big old faith that might might start as a little Mustard Seed but you let it grow up big enough faith faith will move move any obstacle out of the way you got a problem at work it'll move it out of the way you got a problem in your family it'll move it out of the way faith will overcome any obstacle now the question that Jesus is asking there nevertheless when the son man cometh shall he find faith on the earth oh you think about this morning now that God God is watching this congregation God he's he's moving just like in those meetings when brother brandham was speaking now of course certainly we don't we don't compare it all to the ministry that brother brandham had but yet we're preaching the same thing that he preached and in his ministry that the pillar of fire would move over the congregation and move and he'd say there it goes and watch it and I I believe within my heart that what that Pillar of Fire was doing was watching for Faith where where can I find somebody that will believe the words that are being spoken where can I find somebody that that will believe when all the world all that Pentecostal age all the denominations turned their head and said we don't want nothing that you've got but yet there were little people sitting out there in that congregation that said I'll take it I I'll believe it and that's what the pillar of fire was looking for that's what God is looking for this morning I I I was I got I got a the privilege to talk to brother William when he was here in my home and and we got you know you just sitting around talking and we were talking about how that in many meetings that they've been in and many many people many ministers have begin to notice while they're preaching the gospel there'll be an angel standing on the platform you see this we're we're preaching a supernatural gospel where God is still manifest in the in the meeting and that they would say he asked he he had the privilege to to ask a brother when you looked over there and you saw that angel standing on the platform watching the people as you were preaching with his arms folded and and listen it's this happens frequently I I just want to stir up your faith this morning but he would say what would the angel be doing he said watching the people now you think this morning that there could be Angels moving down the aisles this morning watching you watching you to see what's going to happen one time he was he he said he was at a meeting and there was an angel a brother nudged at one brother and he said look there's an angel over there and he looked and there was an angel on the platform and the angel was standing there watching the people and he stood there until the preacher happened to move over where the angel was and then the crowd just erupted because the Angel's there to recognize your faith the Angel's there to do something God is looking to see if there's anybody that wants to believe him and he could be standing here this morning looking to see if there's somebody that will take him at his word off don't you realize morning this morning that if you believe if you have faith in what God promised something will happen that your healing could be manifested in your body or you say well it's just for your dad your dad's the only one that can be healed you if you you see one person being healed it can happen to anybody if you see one person receiving the Holy Ghost you can claim it all that should stir up our faith to believe well if somebody if that person over there can get it why not me oh without faith you cannot please God that's the only way to please God oh you say well I'm I I've got a I've got a good track record for coming to church I've showed up my my attendance streak is really good I've been here for the last 40 years and I've been here but without faith you can't please God without Faith your attendance streak does not mean nothing to God without faith your your tithe paying doesn't mean nothing to God without faith you're paying the park a lot and painting the building and putting shingles on the place and maybe even helping people doesn't do nothing for go doesn't mean nothing to God without faith you cannot please God faith is the only way that you can please God oh you've got to believe God's word and oh there's some benefits tied up in this oh there's some benefits that you can reap by believing God's word if you believe he's still A Healer you can be healed if you and I'm not just trying to trying to excite you I'm trying to stir up your faith because brother brandom said oh he said if you can have faith as a mustard seed you can move a mountain and if a mustard seed faith will move a mountain there in faith is the substance he said how much little less Faith would it take to move that little bracelet hanging there in the room if you never read that sermon before I I encourage you to do that he's talking to that little sister there in the room and he said if you got you say you got all Faith well move that little bracelet that's hanging there and he he he moved it and concentrated on it and moved it and she said how did you move it and he said he said she said who move who moved that was it the devil was it God he said no I moved it you to think think that your faith see that just go goes over our head to think that faith is so powerful that your little faith your faith can move an obstacle your faith can change something and he said if faith is a mustard seed can move a mountain how much little less Faith would it take just to move something like that oh to think now that he said if you a pocket knife it in your pocket faith will put it there and that stumbles us now that stumbles us but it it's yet it's true because the prophet we believe the prophet don't we we believe the prophet y'all don't draw up on me now we believe the things that he said is true faithful faith will do something Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is what a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now that's what we fail to recognize sometimes that God will reward our faith now you think about this little this little woman in this Parable the little Widow that that she didn't have a husband that she could turn to and and do go to battle for her with the with the judge but she just come up there by herself and and started troubling the judge and telling him I I I I I've lost something now see if this morning if you've lost if you've lost your joy you just believe that God will give you back and you he'll give it back if you this morning if you've lost your children if the devil has taking away your children you believe that God will give them back to you you see I I remember Ron Spencer preached one time he preached a sermon take back it's time to take back what the devil stole and I think we can have confidence with fa by faith that if the devil's taking something from you that you got a right to go and claim what the devil stole from you you've got a right like this little widow woman to come and and making make your appeal to the judge make your appeal to God and say come on the scene for me I need you to come on the scene now if God will reward a little if an unjust judge will reward a little widow woman that is an aggravation what about a real child or daughter of God that comes by faith believing in a god that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities believing in a God who is the high priest of our confession oh you should have confidence didn't Paul tell us to come boldly come boldly to the throne of grace recognizing that we've got somebody that's a help to us brother Brown he said he said in accepting God's provided way of at the end time he said cry for your kns that's God's provided way didn't Jesus explain it when he said the unjust judge to the woman that cried day and night how much more would the heavenly father give them the spirit who cry out for it day and night oh my you think now this morning if you're if you're if you're seeking deliverance from the things of this world you've got a promise that God God wants to give it to you more than you want than you want it if you're seeking the new birth and everybody's telling you and the devil's telling you it's too late for you to get it you just keep knocking keep seeking that's what he said seek keep seeking knock keep knocking just keep on till he opens stay out with it cry until the promised word is Vindicated then you got it you don't have to worry no more you see the Bible promised it then stay right there and cry until you get it now now that's what our problem is we back off from the promise we we come to church and we just kind of get into our little State and we feel like we we're we're doing our our our weekly uh like I think it was William or somebody said check checking it off our list but and and we failed to just press in to the promise oh if you could recognize that if you press if you persevere God will give it to you to think about that now whatever whatever promise you can find laying in the Bible you you got to have something to fa base your faith on and what we base our faith on is the word of God so if you can find it in the word laying there you persevere until you get it like Abraham he just kept pressing on believing believeing for 25 years that God promised him a child that God promised him he'd be the father of Nations that God promised him his seed would possess the Gate of their enemy and he just pressed on through through all that oh you think this morning that God gave you that same promise that his seed will possess the Gate of their enemy so you got that same promise so whenever you see the the enemy's gate coming up against you you you press on and say oh maybe in your little prayer closet you say oh God you're the one that made the promise you made the promise and you've got to make a way and Faith begins to go to work something begins to happen something begins to move you begin to call upon God and say I know you made the promise for my children I know you made the promise I got something wrong in my body I need I need healing I need a touch from you so that I can preach your gospel that I can serve you so that I can be a real testimony of what you are and who you are and Sh begin to go to work oh you got to persevere Church you got to press in press on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ this kingdom is taken by force not just a little haphazard not just a little well I'm just going to go to church and that'll be it but you got to press on brother B said when you hear that God made a [Applause] promise when you hear that God made a promise be persever it to see it come to pass oh how many of us could say it you don't have to raise your hands but just think inwardly how many of you know that there's a promise laying there in the Bible that you want to see come to pass you want to see it come to pass and maybe you you just backed off from that promise and you said well maybe one day it's going to happen but oh if we could just really we just push forward and say God I I want to see it now I want to see the healing in my body I want to see I know that you're the one made the promise brother said job look at job when he was afflicted Soares all over him he was all in the plan of God but job too was perseverant because he know that he was keeping God's word nothing was going to bother him oh you think about that little woman that Jesus called a dog that he he said I'm sent to the children of God and you're nothing but a bunch of dogs but he said you know Faith she held on she was persistent persevering oh that's what perseverance does when somebody says something wrong to you or when somebody somebody says something to put a block in front of you but yet you know you read it in the Bible somewhere and you're just going to persevere and hang on to what God Said oh oh listen all of us if we look back in our spiritual journey you look back to when God gave you the Holy Ghost that's my my testimony when I was seeking the Holy Ghost people would tell me that I couldn't do it if I wasn't in this person specific genealogy or there was all these reasons why it wouldn't for you laid reasons down before you but you look into the word and you claim it with perseverance recognizing that if God made the promise he's able to fulfill it oh Think About Little David that he was anointed by Samuel and and he knew that he wasn't going to die he knew that if God had delivered him from The Lion and from the bear that he was more than able to deler that Philistine that uncircumcised Philistine into his hands and he went forth with perseverance with faith faith knowing that that same God that was with him with the lion and the bear was going to be with him when he fought the Goliath and brother BR said he grabbed up his little slingshot and went and brought that sheep back by killing the lion why he was persevering he he killed slew Goliath because he was persevering you got to be steadfast you got to be persevering you got to take take your faith and claim what your god-given right is take your faith and hold it up over the over what God Said and lay it out there and James chapter 1 it said James said blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial for when he has stood the test he will receive the Crown of Life which God has promised to those who love him James chapter 5 said behold we consider those blessed Who Remain steadfast you have heard of the steadfastness of job and you have seen the purpose of the Lord how the Lord is compassionate and merciful oh you you got to you got when you see a promise of God you grab a hole to it and you just lay claim to it and say God this is mine Hebrews chapter 10 said for you have need of endurance so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is Promised oh to think about that endurance now endurance is that that mundane that brother Louise was preaching about uh on Wednesday night the the mundane that that that slow slog up the stature of a perfect man where you're you're yolked up to the ox you're under the ox anointing and you're going up and you're just you're going through endurance you have need of endurance Paul said so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised that slog like like like Abel when he brought his sacrifice up there just believing believing that God would come on the scene and and accept his sacrifice coming coming with his faith believing that God will come on the scene and God accepted it what by fire in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 it says therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast and movable always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that in the work that in the Lord your labor is not in vain oh that's that's an encouragement to any preacher to know that their labor is not in vain many times we preach and preach and not see seems like nothing's really moving but yes something's working because the word will have an effect in people's lives many times you don't see it many times it looks maybe maybe maybe disappointing but there's an encouragement in the words that to be steadfast and movable knowing that in the Lord your n labor is not in vain in Galatians chapter 6:9 says and let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up oh you think about how many times in the Bible Paul and all the all the apostles encouraged us to not give up to just keep pressing on to to just keep pressing on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ and not grow we don't grow weary of saying good things to other people don't grow weary of coming to church don't grow weary because in due season the fruit is going to come up it's going to produce it's going to ripen it's going to produce a harvest in Romans chap 5: 3 to 4 we rejoice in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope oh you've got to endure you've got to endure to get the prize I was I was talking to my brother at work he' been running those uh he he's been running marathons recently I think I mentioned that before but he he you know he just to talk to him about running Mar the ultra marathons like not not 26 miles but like 50 miles through the through the woods or whatever running through the dark in the middle of the night and you got to have endurance then that's why Paul said to run this race run this race well you start you start off the race but in the middle in the middle of the night one time he actually did that he got tired and he just pulled off and he said after about 30 miles he said I I'm I'm done but you see God don't want us to be that kind of a Christian to just get get halfway and just say well I'm done I can't go anymore but you got to persevere press on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ press on press on toward what we get we get seems like sometimes we'll get weary and tired about what we're doing here what are we doing here we're pressing on for the Capstone pressing on to the to the unveiling of the Seven Seals to give us rapturing Faith so don't just cabbage down and say well I got it all I'm I'm I'm good but press on why because faith faith wants the outcome faith wants the body change faith wants to see God do something in your life in Hebrews chapter 12 Paul said therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside also every weight and sin which clings so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking to Jesus the founder and perfector of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the Throne of God oh you think all these promises lay in here about somebody that will seek in Luke 11 he said I say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that askthe that seeketh findeth and the him that knocketh it shall be open I I wonder if we could ask that question this morning just down in our hearts if if there there's something if if you want a further revelation of the of the of of this of the message have you asked God for it have you sought God for it or have you just kind of come to church and said well it's good enough for me to be here it's good enough for me to just check check it off my list but if you got along with God and said God I I need to know I you know I going along my Christian Journey I've I've seen people cry and get all frustrated because they don't understand Daniel 70 weeks and get all frustrated and you know that I think that's a good thing I think that's a thing that be encouraged we should we should want it so bad that we we cry when we don't see it because that's somebody that'll get to Knocking you get to knocking on the door of Christ getting on the on the door get knocking on the door of his promises and God there's God said he would open it up to you now he said now if you notice it isn't just Lord I want it he that askthe keep on seeking keep on knocking just keep on on you've arrived there so just keep on knock knock until it happens I believe it Lord I'm on your hands I'm on your hands oh if we could just be persist persistent be persistent like Ruth who said I'm not going back where I came from I'm not going back I I like I like what brother Louise said on Wednesday night I'm not going back I'm going forward I I I I'm I'm going on D David persisted with when he went got to Goliath shamgar found the promise of God that the land was for him and he he grabbed up that Ox goat and he went after his promise because he persisted with by faith believing that God is the one that made the promise Abraham going on for 25 years persisting and Moses who who 40 years through the Wilderness persisted to believe God's word and and and and to find that promise all these promises that we're laying here all these examples of great faith people that would would persist and believe what God has said brother R said just keep on knocking just keep on seeking just keep on on and Luke chap 11 if a son shall ask any bread of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more sh shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him what's Jesus doing building up our faith oh you see that's what happens as the preaching Goes Forth it something begins to stir within your soul to know that God cares about to think that God cares about you you might have got to a place in your life where you think well God just don't care about me anymore but God still cares God still cares about that gift in your life to to minister to the church he still cares about that gift in your life to play the piano or to sing songs he still cares and he ain't forgotten about you he he cares about you and if we could if our face could could just be built up to recognize that we've got a God that will reward our faith that he cares about us we we've got a God that answers prayer to think about that when you get it down on your knees your prayer is not in vain that there's somebody that listens and hears and will answer back that's why the Bible says pray without ceasing pray you praying will do something praying will accomplish something you get down on your knees in faith or pacing around like the Bible says I stand praying whatever whatever way God will reward perseverant Faith but Jesus is saying God rewards perseverant Faith but will the son of man be able to find anyone that believes that all you think about this morning we got a lot of people that come to church you got a lot of people that that congregate around Believers I I got to reading a thread online of a message thread of just people talking about all the all the different churches that they've been to uh just denominational people seeking seeking a good church to go to and you you think about think about the condition of the world that it's gotten into where churches now they got light shows and and fog machines and uh I I was reading one person said they went to a church and it was a woman preacher got up and they just read real quick a scripture and then they looked like they had like an advertisement playing on the screen and and nothing nothing really pertaining to God at all and that's what this the God of this evil age has caused that's why Jesus could save back then he said when the son of man cometh will will he find faith is he going to find somebody that believes now oh you you elevate that on what what's God looking for in this day God is looking for somebody that where the faith the faith has been built up built up from Luther's preaching and Wesley's preaching to the isus of Pentecost to brother Brandon's preaching to restore us back to the original Faith the original faith of the apostolic B fathers to believe the word for their age that's what God is looking for in this age somebody that will believe what he said somebody that will believe that we're going to take a body change somebody that will believe what like brother Ryan was preaching this uh talking about this morning that that that the stature of a perfect man is not out of our reach that God has given us the recipe for the things he's given us the recipe to come into perfect Oneness perfect Unity with him oh God wants to see our faith God wants to see us God wants to see us enthusiastic about the word excited about the word wantan to see the word made manifest in our life not just tired about it not just all drawn up about it and saying well I'm just going through but if you got as Jesus said if you got faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say under this mountain remove hence to Young under Place another place he said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say to the sycamore tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you now isn't that the same thing brother R was saying when he said if you got faith you can move you can move the little thing hanging there in the room if you got faith it'll put the pocket knife in your pocket now how many of us have testimonies that we can relate to and say I remember when that was was manifested in my life I remember I remember brother in South Carolina brother Al Arnette talking about him and Pat Tyler were riding on the road and they lost their keys and they prayed they leaned over the hood of their car they said we need our keys and they they asked God to give them their keys back and they they raised up from off the hood of the car and the keys were sitting there right where they had been praying how many of you have the same kind of testimony where you lost your keys or you lost your wallet and you prayed and Faith what was if Faith put it there now you see you think it's out of your reach but you believe and you got your own testimony where God did the same thing you believe oh you you have a need in your body and you believe you're sitting there in church and as the word going forth is being preached and Faith takes a hold and something happens and you get up and that back A's gone and you get up and your kidney problems gone and you get up and your kidney stones gone because what faith took a hold faith will do it now Faith just as a grain of mustard seed can move a mountain now brother R said he' say now you start off you might start off with just a little Mustard Seed of Faith but you keep what do you keep adding you keep adding the word and it'll keep growing oh how many don't have to raise your hand but how many want your faith to grow this morning how many would want your faith to [Applause] grow so I I I want to encourage you that if you got this little Mustard Seed Faith this morning it don't have to stay the little Mustard Seed but you know if you if that's all you got Mustard Seed Faith will accomplish a lot just a little mustard SE faith if you just keep hanging on and hanging on eventually you're going to see that mountain move but if you got great big faith that a mountain will just move right out of the way Mustard Seed your little Mustard Seed Faith now brother Brown said this it'll grow into a marble and then it'll grow into a grapefruit and then it'll grow into a mountain siiz faith and now we got to have faith he he said you you you ain't even hardly got faith to see a toothache healed but you got to have faith for a body change so we got to have a great big amount of faith we got to have faith to overcome all these obstacles I I I want to encourage you if you maybe you're struggling with faith to see a toothache healed that that then there's let me encourage you that there's a promise in the word that all things are impossible it doesn't matter if it's kidney stones it doesn't matter if it's a toothache let's get all these let's get all this reasoning out of our mind see as soon as you start going to preaching along these lines people start to reasoning you start talking about what Paul Paul wasn't healed for this and I I remember brother BR wasn't healed with the squirrel and all this kind of stuff let's cast down reasonings and just look to what God's word says it doesn't matter if you've been sitting on your sickness for years and years and the devil's got it in your mind that you just got to deal with it you just got to sit on that you you just got to you just that's just the way it is but yet there's a promise in God's word laying there that we've got to come to we've got to come to the place where we can believe that we can believe like brother brandom did the little fishy fell over dead and he spoke back to life that had R's children were laying over there laughing in the corner and the word the faith came in the room and Faith had an effect to bring those children back to her that's our problem reasoning goes to work that's what the statute of a perfect man is to cast down reasoning the word will get rid of all of our reasoning until our spirit completely lines up with the soul the faith that down on the inside of our heart that's why if you really see what faith is like like that quote brother Ryan was was saying if you really see what faith is it's an impartation of eternal life from you from God himself to you that starts your journey at the bottom of the pyramid faith faith the faith that I have the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God faith is what God has given you as part of the new birth it's his faith it's his life in you his life in you to believe the word and to lay claim to the word that's why you got to be born again because without being born again you can't have that kind of Faith you might have a little bit of faith for the time like the the Believers in the Old Testament Faith to just kind of get get a quick Glimpse at what God wanted them to do but faith that comes with a new birth is God himself in you believing his word to see his word come to pass in you oh that's why it'll produce a miracle in your life that's why it'll change you that's why it'll change your nature it'll change your thinking as as we'll get to this afternoon when I'm I'm I'm going to talk about Oneness brother R said that when Eve listened to the devil's lie it changed her thinking what will the word of God do to you it will change your thinking it will change the way that you act so that you love your brother and love your sister and it'll change you because what is it faith is having a an effect and be not afraid to desire brother said why did he say that about Mustard Seed Faith you cannot hi bre mustard it won't cross cross with nothing you can H breed kale get rapes bud and so forth but you can't H breed mustard it won't cross no sir it's genuine mustard and if you got great big Faith a miracle will happen but if you got just a little bit of faith and this genuine Mustard Seed watch it bring you right on through every case and bring you right out why because Mustard Seed Faith still believes that God is still God Amen oh Mustard Seed Faith will lay H claim to it Mustard Seed Faith oh think about what Mustard Seed Faith is it's not going to mix it's not going to mix with a reason it's somebody says well I don't know if I think you just lost your healing I don't think you really got what you you did but Mustard Seed Faith will just let it'll hang on because it's not going to mix it's not going to mix with the devil's lie it just hangs on mustard Ste Seed Faith what does it do it believes that God is still a rewarder it believes that God will reward you oh oh you see you come you come to God in the middle of the night beside your bed with that kind of faith and and and you might think well my children are past saving well it just don't matter anymore I've tried and I've tried I've tried and I've tried to be healed and I've went to all these doctors but you come claiming claiming your inheritance with Mustard Seed Faith Mustard Seed PA faith can wait patiently and confidently like Abraham for 25 years that's why the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall re their strength as long as you wait the more you wait the more your faith builds up the more you're strengthen the longer it takes the more you believe not the less you believe but the more you believe and God has given us this morning a recipe for Faith and it's laying there in Romans chapter 10 I know this morning this morning is the short lesson so I don't have much longer Romans chapter 10 verse1 14 says how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher how do you even know what to do without a preacher how do you even know what to do without hearing hearing somebody tell you that God made a promise and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peach peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things are the feet of them beautiful that bring Glad Tidings so sometimes you know it feels like they're not sometimes you know like brother R said he got pulled over by that cop one time and he pulled out his wall and said he was a minister and that guy got to got to mocking him and got I I think this is the age where you should we should be giving more respect to the ministers why because they're bringing something to you to help you to get you out of to preach a message of Liberty to get you out of the condition that you're in this this is a age where we shouldn't be putting down ministers and and and making fun of them and putting them under our feet and trying to trying to say we know more about them more about it than them and and the the Bible says that the the feet of of a Preacher is supposed to be beautiful beautiful because it's bringing you something that'll help you and so then then Paul goes on to say in verse 17 so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen so if we want more faith it comes by preaching if we want more faith it comes by the word if we want more faith it comes by repetition just hearing it over and over again now I don't know about y'all but but I like I like hearing things over and over sometimes it seems like you know we want to hear the great the next big thing something that'll just knock our socks off but I like hearing somebody just tell me about being born again I like somebody telling me about the stash your perfect man why cuz hearing those things over and over again it builds up my faith it causes me to know praise God somebody else is getting it somebody else is understanding I like to hear hear kind of things rehash a little bit why because hearing is connected with your faith maybe somebody will rehash something that I preached a long time ago or brother Wade or something but you you preach it again you say it again say it again in the parking lot May many times I've heard somebody say it again in the parking lot and it'll be something that I never thought of and I I oh God thank you for that why because hearing is what is connected with your faith as you receive it in your ears as you receive it through your through through your reading sitting there you're just receiving it in and it's building up something that you can something that you can base your faith on brother B said what a beautiful thing tonight for Divine Healing The Promise is given to you by his Stripes you were healed amen oh you think about that by his stripes you were healed it's yours by promise now we have to go in and take it maybe you can't take it all at one time maybe you can just accept it tonight like I said this morning if you wanted a oak tree in your front yard and somebody give you an acorn you've already got the oak tree you've got it in seed form the only thing you have to do is plant that seed it'll produce the tree so as soon as you get the seed you've got the tree that's right and seed for him now what what's he saying now as soon there's the seed by his stripes you were healed by his stripes you were healed and that's preached over the pulpit and you hear that preach by his stripes I'm Healed and you and it falls down in the good ground of your heart and you just you just sit there and meditate on that God you said byy your stripes I'm Healed and you start thinking about how all that ties together he died on that cross for me he stretched his arms wide for me all the all the scripture Tes ties together and that he he's the one that made the made the sacrifice and you begin to meditate on that that's the seed it's a seed that's planted in your heart and you keep hanging on to that and it's going to come up yes sir oh I thank God that we've got a promise like that that you hear every every promise of God if you'll just hold it in your heart it's going to come up and he said just as soon Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word and when you hear that Jesus Christ is the Healer he's raised from the dead reproducing his life has healed the sick you've all already got your healing in seed form oh to think about that now that as the word is being preached you've already got it you hold it down in your heart you've already got it now now you just got to hang on to it hold it hold don't let it go hold on to it until it comes up and it will manifest now there's there's your the rep recipe for receiving every promise of God that's from the new birth to Healing to Salvation to your children to paying the bills every promise of God you the word is received down in your heart and you just hang on to it you've got the thing you got it just hang on and it'll come up now now bear with me just a little bit just walk through walk through the process of being born again the word you hear the word and you it tells you you need to be justified and and you turn around and you start walking a little bit Direction what the word is having an effect on your life the word is is falling down in your heart and you're hanging on to it it's causing an effect in your life the word you keep you keep laying there under the subjection of the word and the word gets rid of that the the word that you're holding down in your heart gets rid of that unclean spirit and you begin to come to church and you begin to want the things of God and you begin to act different hang around hang around Believers you want different things and you're you're the the life the life starts to change because the unclean spirit's gone out but then that word that you've been packing down in there that word that you held that promise the promise of the new birth now you've hold held on to it and the bad of the Holy Ghost can come on that word and Quicken it now that the unclean spirit's gone out now that you've turned around your trajectory has been changed and it'll bring it up bring it and manifest it in your life see if you've got the seed you've got the thing but you just got to hang on to the promise and watch it produce brother R said let me plant the word of God in my heart and purpose there that I'll not turn to the right hand or to the left hand away from it but I'll live true to it all the days of my my life oh we sometimes we we think the word the gospel is so complicated but it's just as simple as it's so simple you can preach it to some uneducated people in the jungles of Africa that just like just like planting a seed in the field you plant you plant the word in the heart of a Believer you find some good ground and plant that seed in there and it's going to come up Let the Holy Spirit move into our hearts brother Brandon said and plant the word let us be the F that the word will fall in that'll bring forth fruits in the coming year Grant it Lord another place brother R said I I believe that God has to do the saving I believe God has to plant the word I of the Lord says the Bible Isaiah I the Lord hath planted it I'll Water it day and night lest some should pluck it from my hand oh to think this morning that God is looking for somebody that'll hang on to his word like that God is looking for Faith and how do you get Faith by the word he's looking for somebody that'll take what he said and just believe it say that's nothing but the truth like Hatty Wright Hatty Wright got her children to fall over her knees because she just said that's nothing but the truth the word was born and married because she just grabbed hold to the word and said be it unto me according to Thy word the angel spoke a promise over her life and she said be it unto me according to Thy word and now that's that's real Mustard Seed Faith that ain't mixed with no reason of the world there was plenty of things that Mary could have reasoned about she could have said well I'm not married that that would have been a big one I'm not married I've never known a man all these things lay in there that she could have reasoned about but instead of that she cast down reasoning and said be it unto me according to Thy word God is looking for for somebody that he can get a hold of he's looking for that good ground that he can plant that word in he wants to to think that he wants to plant the word in the ground of your heart yes he wants to see you bear fruit he wants to see his promises fulfilled in you and I I believe this morning that that's every one of ours confession this morning that I want to see God's word fulfilled in my life I want to see his promises I want to see you know you know look at the stature of a perfect man there's a promise in here that you can have the same kind of temperance that God had that Jesus had the same kind of patience that Jesus had and that that the this the recipe is laying here in his Bible that to get that same kind of a life you just got to lay under the word and let it have an influence on you you just keep eat taking in those seeds those little seeds as they're planted the little the little bits of word as they're planted and grab a hold to it and believe it and will start to have an effect in your life in Matthew Matthew Chapter 13 it says that he that Jesus was telling that parable of the se he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man and he said in Luke chapter 8 now the parable is this the seed is the word of God and brother Bram would say every spoken word of God is the Original Seed God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again let's let the musicians go ahead and come forward and we'll stop like there now sometimes like you're watching a wheat plant grow up from the little seed it takes time it takes patience for seed to come up it's taking 2,000 years for the bride to come to a place of maturity that that to the the original word the original Faith to be restored back sometimes it takes time patience but that don't matter sometimes it takes time to see something happen in your life and your family's life and your children's life but that doesn't that doesn't matter you just keep holding on to God's word and you'll see it you'll see something happen you love the Lord this morning amen let's just stand to our feet and just Worship the Lord God wants to see what you believe he wants to see you believe what he promised amen he wants he's looking for Faith oh I want to see I want him to see my faith I want him to know that I believe his word yes sir I want him to see that I accept except what he said hallelu oh I was sh by a heavy Mur and I was me the Lord
