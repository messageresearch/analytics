scripture here and trust the lord i'm trusting the lord 2021 to be a more wonderful spiritual year than we've ever had in our lives that's how we have to believe hebrews chapter 10 we'll begin with verse 16. this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there's no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience in our bodies washed with pure water amen let's go to him in prayer the gracious kind heavenly father we bow humbly before you in prayer lord and we're so thankful to you lord and humbled by this opportunity lord that we have father lord may this not be another service lord but may each and every one that's gathered here in this sanctuary and those that are gathered downstairs father and lord those that are gathered by way of the internet father lord may you bring deliverance and healing father and forgiveness and may you amend every broken situation father the lord jesus may may we hear from you not from man this evening father and may your people by their faith in a true and resurrected and living god so pull on you father lord that that you'd even take me off my notes if necessary father lord to go get this one and go get that one father where truly we can say did not our hearts burn within us as you talk to us along the way bless every aspect of this service as we commit ourselves into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you can be seated this evening with the help of the holy ghost i'd like to speak on a title of going beyond the veil it's very important to go beyond the veil because you know man has always had a desire to see god both believer and unbeliever and many times that is the unbeliever's argument is if god exists then show him to me why can't i just walk in and knock on his door and that is the desire and you know god has put that desire in man to hunger for god to have that hunger job even had that hunger he said you know he wanted to go he wanted to find out where god lived he wanted to go talk to him face to face and man to man but see god has always desired he's always veiled himself he hides himself in creation brother men preach the sermon show us the father and that will satisfy us and he would bring out how god was hidden in creation and god was in hidden in his people and god was hitting his son god has always veiled himself so the unbeliever because they don't see god how they feel like they should see god they quit believing in god so it's okay to have that desire but we as believers have seen god and we see god each and every day because god has given us the eyes to see the ears to hear and the heart to understand because you cannot explain faith you cannot show somebody and explain to them faith the prophet the word prophet messenger of this age preached the unadulterated word of god the faith of this hour the faith of the age to change our bodies but he himself could not give you a revelation he himself cannot impart that faith to you it was he he he ran he ran his race he ran his time and now it's our time and so he preached the word so now it's god's grace and to his elect that when we hear the word we receive it and we act upon it because remember you've got to hear it you've got to receive it and then you've got to act upon it it's just like you've got to be justified you've got to be sanctified and you've got to go on to the holy ghost you stop we're just hearing it and you never believe it or you never or you just recognize that god sent a prophet but you don't go on with that that does you no good you've got to hear it you've got to then receive it and receiving it will then make you act upon it because remember the bible teaches us and we were fellowshipping around about this last night is that works that faith is works express works is not going to save you but when you have faith your life will have the works and then people will see your works and be able to see god in your works because of the faith that you have because you have this same faith that was once delivered to the saints so god loves to hide himself he will hide himself in simplicity and then he'll turn right around and reveal himself in that exact same simplicity brother luis god loves doing that he's a master at hiding himself and he loves it so now moses had met the i am god he had met god in a burning bush so god after he ran from egypt god had instructed him to then go back but moses had an encounter with god himself and there was nobody else that was with moses but they had to believe the testimony of moses now it wasn't just the testimony of moses god gave moses two signs to get the people to believe and that vindicated moses that he in fact was the prophet to lead them out of an exodus to fulfill the promise of god so as they came out of egypt and we're all familiar with the story there came a time where god instructed moses on how to build the tabernacle because god has a provided place of worship god wants to be approached a certain way and that is again the unbeliever wants to come his way well if i can't see god in my way then i guess there is no god if god don't answer me the way i think he should answer me then i guess god don't answer prayer god is god and he has a provided way and the way you contact god is through his provided way through the blood of jesus christ that is how you approach god so there was a tabernacle of witness and they all had it set up a certain way and they had an outer court and they had an inner core also called the holy place then they had the holy of holies and that is where god came down and that's where god came down the pillar of fire and that holy presence is where a dead almond rod that was dead and dried for years and years and aaron had it in there god had him prove and he hadn't proven him and he left that stick in there and it not only butted it bloomed it went through its entire cycle to fruition in that holy presence of jesus christ and that holy presence of god well there was a veil there and man could not go there was only one man a high priest once a year could go in that veil and he had to have a certain approach he had to have a certain walk he had to be dressed a certain way he had to walk a certain way and he could not the bible says he could not enter in there without blood god always requires blood for worship so so the high priest would go in there and he'd sprinkle for his sins for the sins of the people and and ask god to forgive them and god would forgive him based on his plan of redemption because you think of how powerful that was it was the blood of bulls and goats and god almighty would look down through the blood of a bull and a goat and would cover their sin it wouldn't completely do away with it but it would cover it because it was a temporary way so that was though he would sprinkle the blood on god's mercy that was behind the veil so we know that that that as the tabernacle of witness was really just a type of jesus christ when he came he was god's tabernacle of witness he was god's dwelling place he was where the pillar of fire came and rested he was god's mercy and so much can be said here but we're just going to kind of move through it and i know that that these brothers have covered this at different times in different angles but jesus christ was god's mercy seat but when god's mercy seat came in the form of a man he took 16 elements and he came into that body he was god and he was god's mercy seat was in 16 elements was in flesh and blood was behind skin was behind a beard walked around got dirty got a headache and that was god's mercy seat but god was veiled and 99 of israel could not go behind the veil and they could not recognize they missed god's message they missed they did not recognize that it was god in jesus christ and just like that mercy seat was the only place for mercy in the old testament jesus christ is the only place for mercy you've got to get to the mercy seat or you'll die in your sins if the blood was not sprinkled on the mercy seat in the tabernacle of witness then god could see their sin [Music] so when jesus was god's mercy seat and they took god's mercy seat and they attacked him to a cruel cross and see a lot of things and let me just say this here many times you can hear the word you hear about jesus dying on the cross and you hear the gospel we cannot let it become mundane we cannot let it become common you hear it and you hear it but it's the truth because a lot of times when you hear the word you might you might hear a lot of these things that have been spoken or next weekend or as a different brothers as a minister you hear the word but it's important because you can hear the same thing one day and you miss it and then you come on the next service and god is trying to get it to you and we're going to get to this a little later on it's important to not be distracted by the veil don't be distracted with who the voice of god comes through that you miss the voice of god himself because god could have ordained the trees to preach the gospel that's right and they do in their own way but god gave man through the foolishness of preaching that is god's way so whenever you hear the word you might how many you know you've heard of brother brain you've heard the same tape over and over but one time you really hear it right you might have listened to it before but one day you hear it that is what that is when faith is quickened brother zach that is when you grab a hold of it and that's what's important not to miss that is like hearing your name so they took god's mercy seat and they nailed him to a cross right and god is a vindication he sent he whenever jesus died the veil of the temple was rent and twain now the veil of the temple was not just a bed sheet it wasn't just some paper thin the theologians tell us that the temple veil was 20 feet wide by 60 feet tall that is six stories that's like a six story building and it was four inches thick and god supernaturally brother wait rent that veil from top to bottom and when he rent that veil it exposed god's true mercy seat which was the lord jesus christ and you find when you read the bible they still missed it because after jesus after they killed him after he rose from the dead they were still partaking in old testament worship scofield tells us that that means they must have re-sown the veil after god supernaturally after he supernaturally rent the veil they passed it off as some natural probably during the earthquake or some natural occurrence and they went back and they sewed it together not realizing that god was finished with that form of worship they were too blind they were too blind to see the supernatural renting and when that suit and when that supernatural renting opened the veil they did not go beyond the veil and see jesus christ is god's so mercy christ was on the cross and he was veiled as i said with 16 elements of flesh and not only did the old the temple they'll have to be rent but jesus christ's own veil had to be rent when he was hanging on the cross this roman soldier literally went there with the spear and pierced the veil he rent the veil and water blood and spirit as we know came out of jesus and that was the birth of the new church that that was that was the birth of the church there and them elements that was the elements of the new birth just as the elements of the natural birth but they couldn't recognize that that was god's mercy seat hanging on that cross because of the veil that god came in and that is the problem in every age is they they trip they cannot go beyond the veil they cannot go in the old testament they would stone the prophets because they could not recognize the word that was being veiled behind the flesh of the prophet so the same thing is repeated in this end time the seals hid christ but there was there was a there was a renting there was a there was an unveiling god had a prophet on the earth that he revealed his seals to and it exposed the enemy but it revealed christ but what can people see they can only see a seventh grade education they can only see a man stumbling over his words they can only see they knew something supernatural was happening but most people couldn't grab hold of it because they were stuck on the veil and even in this end time you have people that can't get past the veil of the prophet they can't see the god that he introduced they can't see the god in the bride they can't see the bride's portion in the word because all they see is the veil it's veiled but you've got to go beyond the veil you've got to go beyond the veil of your own flesh you got to go beyond the veil of the prophet you've got to see that jesus christ was god himself and you see that people still get stuck and they still don't really understand who jesus was they think he's some third person they think he's he's this that or the other they think he's just a prophet the jews to this day are still blinded until them two prophets go to them they're still blinded that's right why because of the veil that god put on because the veil of humanity because they cannot go past the veil so the word was veiled by traditions it was filled by churchianity it was filled by thoughts it was veiled by false doctrine but god sent a prophet in this end time and it struck the veil off the whole thing there's a quote here i'm gonna read a quote where he said he's in plain view just like when the old testament veil was rent from top to bottom that exposed jesus in plain view and they were so blind instead of running to the mercy seat the only place for salvation and mercy they sewed it up and went right back to old testament worship right you had the prophet of god on on in more of a supernatural ministry than just in the from the last 2000 years or more the most vindicated prophet ever receiving the revelation of the seals then you had the world going on how many people were in the tabernacle hearing the seals being preached and went right back to denominationalism went right back to the world and we even see it today people leaving the message going right back to the world in the unveiling of god brethren says now and one time if a man walked through that veil it was sudden death it was literally sudden death to walk through that veil now it's death not to go through it amen if you can't break that veil of tradition break that veil of denomination to see god in his power it's death once where it was death to go in now it's death to stay out the whole mercy seat is setting in plain view anybody can see it the veil is rant glory to god what is the work of the ministry to point you to that mercy seat to say it's rent get to the mercy seat get to the mercy seat it reminds me of them cherubims where at first they were guarding the tree of life and now brother and i said they're running people to the tree of life that is what the difference of redemption made that is that is what that is what jesus died on the cross did for us so don't get caught up that it's just another church service there is just preaching well brother wade is preaching brother dale brother bob brother luis or brother aaron or whoever may be preaching it's just another service every service is a call for you to come up higher every service is a call for you to repent if you're in that situation every call is for the justifier to be sanctified and whatever it's always a call to go up no matter how long how many years you've been born again every service is a call to go up higher to be more like him every service is a call every service is a call to a feast but don't miss it because of the veil right don't miss it right so the veil was torn spirit is pressured aside and it released life and power to the believer it made the new birth possible you can have what david could not have you can have for what david longed to have and could not you can have what abraham longed to have right all these people you read about in the bible that that are your bible heroes and every one of them are heroes and they're your favorite bible characters you can have or you have by the new birth what they long to have what they were looking forward to so now by the new birth you have access to god himself amen remember when god came down on mount sinai if even a a cow or anyone touched it they had to be killed but that god now wants to live in you [Music] you know god was with them and as wonderful as that was the 12 disciples he wasn't satisfied he wanted to be in you brother luis he wanted to be in you brother bob he wanted to be in you sister he wanted it wasn't enough to just be with you he wanted to be in him so now god is veiled in so many ways and god is also veiled in his word and christ is revealed in his own word brother ram said and he so designed that he can hide himself in the scripture to the smartest theologian there is oh my he can just hide himself sit right there in the scripture and you look all day long and never see it look a lifetime and never see it he can just hide himself sitting there now please everywhere let that soak in that god in the word can hide himself so in the word there isn't a theologian or school in the world could ever find him yet he's sitting right there it's so clear to you it's so clear to you and you are so excited and you go and you try and witness to someone but if they're not ordained to life you can't quicken it to them you present it to them and then it's between that individual and god because your coworkers or your own family can get can stumble by the veil they're if they're not stumbled by your veil then they're stumbled by the veil of the prophet they're stumbled by the simplicity of the gospel they're they're they're they stumble at the veil of the letter of the word amen so brother ram teaches us that the prophets were deity veiled now it's not about the flesh that was deity but it's the worth he carried inside of them brother dale that was that was deity so that was a problem with israel like i said they could never identify the prophets for who they were they would stone them they would saw him asunder because of the veil because the veil that was hiding the word they could not see past that veil jesus said o jerusalem jerusalem thou that kill us the prophets that stone us them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth their chickens under her wings and you would not right brother abraham said in the unveiling of god he said in type moses coming from the presence of god with the word of god for that age now watch he said we're in exodus we're now in exodus 19 don't miss this now exodus 19 moses is coming from the presence of god moses is coming from the presence of god he has been into the word the word has been wrote and he in the presence of god with the word he had the word for that age there is a word for each age and moses coming forth his face shines so see the word was in him ready to be manifested give out to the people and brother ram had read his text there i believe he's in first corinthians chapter three the true word god had wrote it and it was with moses notice it was with moses and was ready to be manifested he was the word to them he was the living word hid veiled himself god moses had to put a veil over his own face why he was that word amen until that word was made known moses had to veil himself amen he said do you see it wherever the word is it's veiled and don't ever believe her son or daughter of god shortchange yourself for what's inside of you don't ever shortchange yourself because of the faults of your flesh of what you're really tabernacling inside of you [Music] because remember our flesh is not redeemed our flesh is not born again but satan will have you so busy looking at your flesh you do not realize what you're carrying he will give you spiritual amnesia as soon as he can that you forget who you're tabernacling that you are literally as a messiah you're like literally a mini tabernacle of witness and god despite what your flesh says despite what your human spirit said the pillar of fire god himself deals with your soul on the inside in that throne room that god reserves only for he and you to dwell but you're walking around clocking in your job you're walking around working your business you're walking you're driving around delivering mail whatever your trade or business may be but you're a born-again son or daughter of god tabernacling deity himself now moses had the word now remember after the word was manifest and i want us to hold this in mind because we're going to come back to the statement of the prophet he said after the word was made manifest moses was moses again israel couldn't deify that's why god did away with his body so they couldn't raise an idol in the image of moses he was a a word prophet of that age but he was not acting remember he got out of control when he smote that rock when he should have spoken to it and that kept him out of the promised land so moses was moses when he did that but when he came down with the ten commandments brother brahm taught us that he took the place of god because moses had the word right and the word was getting ready to be delivered see the difference but then after the word was delivered he was moses again he had his habits he had his own temper to deal with he had his own faults he had his own failures he was moses but when he got that word when god spoke to him right the people had to listen remember god swallowed up the earth for people that came against that prophet and what do you see what are we seeing today as people are going against this message the world is opening up and they're being swallowed by the world because they're coming against the word not because they're coming against a a bootlegger's son a man from kentucky it's because they're coming against god's prophet it's because they're coming against his message god will defend his message god vindicates his message [Music] so moses after the word was made manifest moses was moses again see but while the word was in him to be give out he was god and you got to have spiritual understanding to understand that statement remember when people say well you put you know you make uh whenever someone was trying to come and set a trap for brother brown and they said people make a god out of you and what brotherhood said is that that far from the truth is that that far off from the bible but when you have spiritual understanding you don't make a god at a program amen he was god well he wasn't moses no more he had the word of the lord for that age nothing could touch him till that was over he had that word with him so therefore when he come the people turned their heads they couldn't understand they had been changed he was a different fellow he come with that word and he put a veil the bible said over his face for he had the word and he was the word to them your prophet said that you are the final voice of the final age you're the word we are the word incarnate to our generation we are the manifestation of the word the prophet of god said abroad would be here the bible said the bride would be here is she here that's a vindication of the word that is but she's veiled you like to eat you like to sleep you like to go on vacation you have to you get sick just like the rest of the world but is it what do you have on the inside of you that's that resurrection power before the resurrection power get you know raises the saints that passed on it first raised them from their new birth from their first birth i mean that resurrection power [Music] so the same applies to every prophet to every word prophet of every age when they have the word to give out while moses was in the mountain receiving the word the nation of israel was sinning right at the foot of the mountain while brother bran was in in in the mountains receiving the word of the lord vis has having a visitation of seven angels the world was sinning tucson went on and flagstaff in that area went on like it ever did it didn't change the amount of lives it didn't change the amount of adultery didn't change the amount of all these things but yet god was dealing with his prophet let's go to exodus 32 and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both of their sides on the one side and on the other were they written the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables in revelations 5 1 the bible says and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals glory in exodus moses tells us that when he had the tables it were written on both sides i'm gonna read a quote where brotherham types the commandments when he brought them forth as a type of the seven seals see they were both written within and without and moses came as a word of the age the commandments the ten commandments didn't just float down god had him in a man and spoke the word and he had a people to receive it program said the pillar of fire appearing visibly among us identifying that the message is right like he did at mount sinai remember before the true message come forth moses preached and he led them out of egypt but there before the real commandments was laid down the seals was brought in god come down before the people and prove that moses was sent from him that right in a pillar of fire that moses said he had seen in a bush and talked to him i pray you can see a parallel between moses and brother branham brother brandon met an angel and the angel specifically told brother branham as moses was given two signs so will you be given two signs there's a connection between moses and brother branham so they were both given two signs and they both had when moses went and he did exactly what god told them he threw that rod on the ground brother bob and it became a snake but then jen he didn't realize janice and jammers did the same thing brother graham said that he had to just wait and see what god was going to do brother branham had janice and james rise up and try and impersonate the gift that god gave him but brother braham didn't just start attacking him and saying don't listen to them he said he was their folly was made manifest they ended up wrecked up somewhere and see brother graham came on the scene and told us that he met an angel and that he get the people to believe him and all these different things that we know that what would happen and then he would vindicate the prophet over and over and over for all them years just as he vindicated moses brought them through the red sea prove them over and over and over that moses was god's messenger and then it's like he had that capstone when he brought down the commandments he had the law to give him he had the word to give them so let's drop down to verse 26. i'm sorry let's go up to 17 and get a little background and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there's noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of then it shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear and it came to pass as soon as he came down to the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses's anger wax hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and break them beneath them out let's drop down to verse 26 then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gather themselves together unto him and moses being the type of brother brandon brother i'm stood in the gate which is christ and he said in this to this generation he said whoever is on the lord's side let them gather themselves into this word not unto me the man unto this word this banner of the word and who do you have but the sons of levi come in brother said that was the type of the bride though in the book of revelation saying that said that he will make us that he has made us kings and priests and we shall reign with him on the earth why because we recognize we can look past the veil we can go beyond the veil and recognize god manifested right because you could look beyond the veil now the same applies to us in a minor way in a messiah kind of way right and you know let me just also say this that also brings to mind the importance of a true god called ministry because whenever you hear the word preached and satan will try and attack your mind that somebody told them that this and that and this is going on and that's going on and you miss it because of the veil but whenever the spirit of god strikes and is trying to deal with your situation and you pass it off as somebody told them or how do they know or everybody knows it's me you miss it and it's god speaking to you through the veil the minister don't know it no one else may even know it but because you get hung up on the veil you miss it all right amen right so it's important to sit under a god called ministry that when the word comes forth you know that it's pure and you're checking it with the word because the ministry is no don't have its own message the ministry only speaks with a messenger has already spoken so then that makes it deity speaking and not the veil it doesn't make it man but can you recognize it or are are we so stuck on the flesh are we so stuck on personality you have to look past the veil you have to look past your own veil you gotta look past the veil of the minister whoever is bringing the word if not you're going to miss it because the final revelation of the word ends up in the bride the bridegroom call brother said will come through this and where is it going to go in flesh just as it did in jesus the old testament ended up in jesus christ he was a fulfillment of the law and the prophets and the bride is the fulfillment of the word i think you the born again believer the born holy ghost field elect child of god is literally the manifestation of the word just as jesus was by the holy ghost but you could be you again yeah you've got to separate that we're all still we're all still in our ways carnal we still all have on personalities and our own faults but look past the veil look past the veil because everything we say must be backed up by the word we don't have our own word it's got to be backed up by what has already been spoken right so whenever you put the word of mouth the word of god on your on your lips under inspiration and in faith it's like deity speaking you speak to your mountain but then you go to work on monday morning and it's you again but you just overcame devils through your own flesh or through your own will through your own power but through the word of god as deity veiled in flesh but then you sisters have to go clean the house and you're you again yeah still communion with god though you brothers are cutting your grass you're you again the grass has got to be cut but it's deity on that mower see don't get hung up on the flesh so when when we're not when we're not speaking the word we're us again we we can be silly we can just fellowship we can do this that or the other do our own thing but when you put the word of god on your on your lips in faith think about that that is like deity speaking the same deity that said let there be light the same deity that holds this entire world in orbit lives in the soul of an elected child of god [Music] but we can get so hung up on our own flesh and we can't see past our own flesh well i can't do this that's true you can't but quit looking at your veil and look at what you're tabernacling look at what you're tabernacling we're all familiar with the quote but i read he said so when a spirit born spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips while that is the same as deity speaking all right every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man well we've heard that quote 100 times that's true i have too but one of these times has got to strike faith in our hearts because if you just hear it brother wayne and it just goes over you but we believe it amen that's right but it's got to it's got to grip you and then you can speak to your mountain then he can speak to your situation and you understand that it's not you when jesus went to lazarus's grave program said and he wept like a man and he was sad that his best one of his best friends had died but he said when he put him little shoulders back and he said lazarus come forth right that was more than a man that was god because remember when he got hungry as a man he got hungry he got sleepy but then when he said peace be still right that was god elijah the bible says was a man subject to like passions as we are he was a man but when he walked in the face of a habit said not even dew will fall not even do will fall until i call for it amen amen that was deity speaking out man that wasn't elijah that's right when he when he had that mount carmel showdown that was deity speaking that was god in control of a situation but then whenever he got the letter that threatening letter from jezebel and he ran elijah was elijah again you see the difference but he was god he was god was veiled in elijah god was veiled in elisha god was veiled in brother branham he could sin and he could joke and he could he could cut up like any other man and enjoy the natural things of life sit around a table with his friends and tell a story about a hunt but then all of a sudden when sister hattie wright said the right thing god came over god came and took control god came and took control of his veil and said anything you ask what man can say that what human being in the right mind can say ask anything but do you know that if god reveals it to you right now this church you can receive the same thing because we're not talking about the flesh we're talking about god himself you believe it you receive it the same way hattie wright did and you received the same result that she did you have that childlike attitude that she did of that's nothing but the truth and you bring and you have you hold whatever you need in your heart amen and deity can come down and give it to you whether it's directly or right from this pulpit god can give it to you because it's not the veil it's not man it's god himself that does it man right amen after after that situation brother branham became brother branham again remember i think his sister had her right sister that he couldn't understand he'd pray for her and he prayed for her and he prayed for her and she was sick to the day she died because brother graham could only do what god gave him to do amen brother said now i'm just your brother by the grace of god but when the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you what if we can receive true anointed god-ordained ministry in the same way right how would that change our church services how would that change things right or are we just looking at the veil that's brother so-and-so preaching yep he usually preaches this long he's your preacher from this angle but to really realize right because there's people that have invaded the pulpits that shouldn't be preaching we know that but the holy ghost in you should be able to discern a gift of god and when that word is coming forth and you receive it in your heart and say that's nothing but the truth god can give it to you if you take it as god's voice to you that doesn't glorify man that glorifies god amen god receives the glory of what happened to sister had he right what would brother ram say a lot about whenever that pillar of fire come down on the river and on the pillar and the picture of the pillar of fire that was taken over him and things he said i was just there when it happened right he said now i'm just your brother by the grace of god but the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you he said maybe if i offended you by saying that forgive me but i felt that it might be resented but i and god's voice to you see i say that again that time was under inspiration see i felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it brother branham and his humanity and his humility apologize for it and the spirit of god said don't you apologize you say it again receive the word of god that's what it's all about you receive the word for your healing you receive the word for the holy ghost you receive the word for everything for deliverance you can't receive nothing from god without receiving his word that is how you receive something from god amen and if you're constantly stuck on the veil and that can go both ways you cannot lift man too high god will not share his glory with nobody god gets the glory amen so our flesh is the veil that hides god in a born-again believer it's interesting that the first veil was actually made of badger skins have any of you in here ever have y'all petted a badger or anyone petted a badger lately they're mean and that's how our first birth is it's mean it's just it's flesh and that's what that's what the temple veil was made of badger skins among other things because remember our flesh is still not born again amen our natural our five natural senses our spiritual senses or the the human reasoning and imagination all these things that's not boring again you'll think things and imagine things and remember things that aren't of god but that's how you've got to have the holy ghost in there to bring you right back in bring you right back in check that's what matters the holy ghost because if not that's what makes people do things all kinds of crazy things they don't have the top hosts all they have is their flesh and that's a miserable condition to be in to just not have a typos and just do what your flesh feels to do what runs through your mind to act to fly off the handle now we still make mistakes because we're human but we have a heavenly father that forgives us brother ram said in hebrews chapter 6 he says here it is hold it tight the veil talking about the flesh is what keeps us from living the way we should veil is what keeps us from doing the things that we really want to do and paul covers this when i want to do good evil was right there and god became veiled in flesh and the veil was tore in two and god became god again and he raised up that veil that he hid himself that's the resurrection of the lord jesus proving to us that in this veil that we're now hidden by faith we believe it and accept it but when this veil is torn in two i'll go in his presence with this assurance knowing that i know him in the power of his resurrection amen at the coming of the lord jesus this veil will be raised up again in a perfected way till i walk and talk with him as my savior my god when he takes the throne of david and will live forever in this veil after it's been perfected but this veil still has sin in it don't ever think of that glorified body in this earth it's got to die same as your soul has got to die to be born again before we can't see him in these bodies naturally speaking we've got to be changed first this veil's got this natural veil's got to be ranked just like brother brown said your soul has got to be born again that first birth has to be rent so our flesh we're we're speaking in by monica's house they're about angels in the presence of the lord and things and it's our natural it's our flesh and it's our senses that's keeping us from seeing the angels of god encamped right here it is our flesh that keeps us from seeing jesus christ himself walking through these aisles it's our natural senses that keep us from seeing the pillar fire in every service now god will allow us in his grace can still allow you to see them things and open your eyes and things but it doesn't change the fact that he's not here it doesn't change the fact that his guardian angels are not always encamped about about you because he promised he would we go by the word not by what we see paul said he dies daily so our flesh must also be torn so that jesus can be seen in us paul said in galatians 2 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the veil or in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i love this quote brother m said and i know and they have to have a crucifixion before you can have a resurrection this is a wonderful quote to read right around new year's as we're thinking about the new year i'm trusting god for things that i've never that i've just never experienced i want new heights i want i want greater heights with him i want to know him more than i've ever known him before i want to be so sensitive to his spirit to where if he's pleased i know it if he's displeased i want to know why i repent and that's possible that's not just for ministers that's not just for brothers that's for housewives that's for children that's we're single that's for young single brothers single sisters that's for everybody you can have it he said and before the church will ever be able to see a resurrected power before i can ever see a new ministry take place myself before you can ever enter into a new fellowship with god there has got to be a self-crucifixion so that there can come a resurrection we've got to die out to our own thoughts die out to our own ways die out to everything that's around us go through the trials and tribulations that we might see a new resurrection a new life before a sinner can ever become a christian there has to come a death then a resurrection nobody in their flesh or in their veil loves trials and tribulations but you know the only way to get from one mountaintop and another is go through a valley and that's where the character of god is made we all want god's character we all want to be just like jesus but you're not you don't become like jesus on the mountaintop right you become like jesus in the valley on the mountaintop you ever look back and say thank you lord i can see where i'm more like you than i was on that other mountaintop and back in the valley you go back in the valley you go so we must look beyond our own flesh and human spirit to see god working in you and in each other amen we cannot get as as it keeps getting repeated you cannot get so hung up on your flesh you cannot get so hung up on what someone said to you or what someone did in the flesh were they in the flesh yeah but you can't get hung up on it you got to look past that you got to see the intentions you got to see the god that's on the inside they need more of god but so do you so do i we all need more of god everybody needs more of god so let's not get hung up on that veil all right brother and uh romans 10 6 but the righteousness which is a faith seeketh on this why say not in that heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach a holy ghost believer gets sick or there's someone in their home that's sick they can't get a hold of the pastor well no what am i going to do how am i going to get god here how am i going to get how am i going to bring deliverance to this person the word of god is naive and even in thy mouth well i'm not a preacher it doesn't matter well i'm not a brother it doesn't matter i'm not a grown-up it doesn't matter you have god amen if you're born again you've got the deity of god in you it's not where am i going to go to find god how am i going to bring god on the scene right paul said he's naive in thy mouth an in thine heart that is the word of faith which we preached he's with you he's a very present help in a time of trouble but if you're always putting yourself down and you're allowing the devil to put you down i can't i you know you think of a parable of someone that you know that may that you've got you've got the king with you he is your personal he he's your personal bodyguard but yeah you're always walking in fear but yet you've got the king himself is by you and he's not only by you he's in you but you're always looking for god somewhere else because satan keeps beating you up in the flesh satan keeps beating you up in the flesh and he keeps working you around your emotions but you've got god in you by the holy ghost you have god in you he's nigh you he's in your heart and he's waiting to be called on the scene the disciples were on a boat and they were testifying they were testifying about all the things that god has done they were so excited they've seen god jesus do so many things and how he fed the 5 000 and how he healed the leper and what what he might how he delivered legion and all these different things and then their own storm arose and they got so distraught of trying to bail all the water out of the boat and trying to row the boat to land and this and that they forgot who was in the boat with them they forgot that the the that the king of kings that the god who created the water that satan had stirred up was in the boat with them and they begin to cry and they begin to fear and they begin to to to to think they were going to die and that's what satan's intention was but they remembered who was in the boat with him you've got to remember who's in your boat you've got to remember who resides in you and you've got to wake him up you've got to wake him up brother ram one time even typed it like he's sleeping between revivals and you can get caught up in the flesh and you can and you can just go a long time and you've got to remember who's in your boat who's in your soul if you have god in your soul it doesn't matter what storm satan tries to put you through right it doesn't matter what you're going through in life wake jesus up wake him up in your boat how do you wake him up prayer faith attendance to his word and you wake him up and he'll stand on the brow of your boat and he'll speak peace to your storm he'll bring you deliverance but you've got to wake him up you've got to wake him up brother graham said in awakening jesus he said you know what he's doing he's here tonight waiting to be proved now don't think of this in 1963. he's here on december the 31st 2020 after a rough year for the world and he's waiting to be proved right right that's right you know what you ought to do you ought to do like they wake jesus that's in us wake jesus in your own lives the god that sets your soul of fire with the holy ghost that the god that taken these blinded eyes of mine opened them up the god that raised me off of a deathbed the god that i seen bring the dead back after being dead for hours the doctor pronounced dead and write a statement to it five different times awaken that god wake him him up we ought to call jesus on jesus and wake him and call him on the scene we have need of him yes sir how many have in need of the lord you've got a need of the lord hold that need in your heart and with faith you awaken jesus and if he if the disciples are able to wake him up in the natural how much more can you wake him up on the inside how much more can he respond to faith how much more can he respond to our hearts cry he said awaken that god waken him up we ought to call g on jesus and wake him and call him on the scene we have need of him yes sir then call him to confirm his word if we wake him up get him stirred up in us till our own doubts and frustration has passed away now call him and say lord you promised a little while and the world would not see you would see you no more and i'm not of the world you pray that i'd be not of the world and i'm not of the world i'm yours and you said the world will see me no more yeah you'll see me uh-huh you'll see me lord i want to disturb you i want to arouse you out of my own sleeping body my own sleeping heart of these realities waken jesus come to me then the doubts and fears will cease and you can be backslidden maybe not talk to him for a long time but he's still there right where you left him he's still there go to him wake him up right and he'll rise on the scene they recognize if they would have been stuck on just on not knowing who he was but they knew who to run to by the way in a time of trouble they knew that that body that that whatever five foot something frame that frail looking frame that looked to be 50 years old or more they knew that that body tabernacled the god of abraham they knew that tabernacle bodied he was the messiah they weren't hung up on his flesh it's time we as message believers go beyond the veil it's time that we as message believers go beyond just the natural things it's time that we as message believers go just beyond the tape of the letter of the of the books or maybe just the sound of the prophet's voice go into what he said go into who he introduced go beyond that veil now we know that god brother ram said that god ordains his prophets in certain ways or certain personalities to catch the people but go beyond that go beyond the god that he introduced go beyond the the veil of your own flesh and awaken jesus don't get stuck on flesh look beyond that because the god of heaven the god that you think the prophets were deity veiled and with i think the very when they would say thus saith the lord that wasn't thus saith the prophet right that was thus saith the lord so whenever you repeat thus saith the lord it's not the say of brother terrence if he's speaking what has already been spoken as thus saith the lord is still thus saith the lord it's still deity rolling off of our lips you think what a mighty god we serve you think of what almighty god that he would take clay that he would take humanity and he'd make a way that we can be born again right fallen sons and daughters of god he'd make his brother zack a way that we can be born again and he would actually speak through our lips and if you can look past the veil if he can look past the messenger if you can look past the flesh of one another you can hear from god if you can look past the veil of one another you could be out there fellowshipping and god can speak to you god doesn't quit speaking when the minister steps off that's right when the songs go forth god's still speaking when a brother comes up here bows his heads and prays god is still speaking when y'all come in and get settled in and start getting those minds on the lord and they play the portion of the message god is speaking amen god is speaking from the moment you walk in and he don't quit speaking right he should be speaking to you and you should be speaking to him before you walk through the doors and you come expecting if you just come with your mind filled up with the things of the world and we all have to get cleansed we all have to forget about tomorrow we all have to forget about what was done today and we've got to ask god to help us to get our minds in a mindset to receive the word to receive the word and not just see a brother standing here speaking the word but to realize that that's for me that's the word of god that he's speaking so god help us as we as i just begin to close god help us in this new year in this end time you know we have a i just have a thirst for god like i've never had before and i believe you do too or you won't be here till midnight to have a thirst for god like we've never had before glory there's many things we don't understand with all this covid and all these things we have to do to just make a way but god sees your faithfulness it's not convenient for anyone to wear a mask it's not convenient for anyone to not be able to to fellowship like they want and all they do these different things but god sees your faithfulness that you're still in the house of god you're still pulling on the gifts of god you're still here supporting the church god sees it and god recognizes it you're not getting stuck on the flesh well it's comfortable right it's uncomfortable for everybody but god is still making a way god's gospel is still going forth souls are still being saved people are still getting the holy ghost this message is still being translated this message is still being sent around the world god is still getting his bride ready regardless of how many masks they try and you know the governments and things may make us aware god is perfecting a bride and we're going to be without spot or wrinkle now god is not looking at your flesh when he said that right he's perfecting the inner man amen god bless you let's stand to our feet and we'll go to him in prayer the gracious heavenly father we bow humbly before you in prayer lord jesus we thank you father for your many blessings lord and we're so thankful to you lord for the things that you brought us through this year father lord we've seen many things lord

we're gonna talk about something uh some of you is gonna laugh some of it we gonna cry and whatever but but it's about it's the title of it is called the coveted cocktail you'll understand that a little bit later on as we all know you know mom and dad both had to cut look at mama she had to covet and you know mom she she had it more in her or up here and it didn't bother as much of course she went to hospital she's still having trouble with it but uh you know dad took care of her all that time and we never even went in the house down there we never went in not a one time we didn't get around them or nothing and dad took care of her so then dad got it it was on a sunday it was like a kick pretty much was like a kick in the gut because i thought he was just sick like he'd get sick you know coughing and trying to get some attention and stuff like that but then he went got tested so i had to say well you know he had it so i was supposed to do this about a month or two ago but i didn't do it uh and then you know through the time of monday through thursday dad was sick mom was taking care of him and of course i'm gonna tell you this don't never get my mom to be your nurse if she was your nurse y'all were in trouble of course we knew that growing up me and wade and anna of course i think i was more than them but because i tried to get out of school i'd say well you know my stomach's hurting take me to the doctor stick him here and get him married get him here you know of course you know it worked some but some of it it didn't but mom and dad he'd be down there sitting outside and mom would be have that little what's that little thing called oxygen level and he'd have one finger out his mouth open like a bird because she was taking his chimp here every 15 minutes his temper birch i mean check oxygen it'd be 83 didn't he did he well i'm not gonna do that but then he'd go he'd do the bird finger out and then you check in it'd be 91 well the doc ruth or some of the other ones when we appreciate ruth uh mcferron she helped a lot check this finger and it'd be 91 and then then five minutes later be back in his mouth again this finger would be 88 and you know just trying to find it to get it better you know rub this finger go put it in hot water and bring it out so all that went on from monday to thursday and then mom called me on friday i mean we we talked to each other we didn't go down there at all we never went in until friday i went down mom called me let's see i'm trying to read my writing that i wrote a long time ago mom called me on friday she was real upset course all the time and then all that time during the time he'd run a temperature and you know he just he couldn't breathe and you know just doing crazy stuff really i think it was just a lot of her attention but one day we'll know and he he's not never going to say that but anyway she called me she said dad has got the thermostat at 52 degrees in this house crying and you know all upset so i said well i got to go down there it's my first time so i go down there i didn't put on gloves and we all talk about masks and all this about that i wore a mask every time i went in there and i'm going to tell you 100 i got the covet from him because i you can ask after that i went to the roof of their house unless it was a plane that dropped it and if you've ever been at my mom dad's house there's airplanes that come on every one minute there's a landing area and if unless they dropped it out of that he gave it to me okay we understand that which is fine but i had a mask on every time i went down there dumb but anyway i went in down there he had set to he got hot and set the thermostat at 52 degrees of course you can imagine what that is in your house i mean you know it was cold mom's over in the corner doing this so i told him i said now look and he knows this stuff he knows i mean you don't have to he was saying well if you turn the thermostat way down then it's supposed to get colder yeah right but it don't blow no ho no more to get to 52 than it does to get from 70 down to 69. so i mean he was but he was running a temperature and he wasn't thinking all exactly right so the next day next day let's see saturday you know we go through and talk and everything on saturday evening mom calls i can't breathe down here daddy's done something to the thermostat again crying and all upset so i go down there he had run it to 80. he'd run it up to 80 because he got cold another day you know and mom's down there you know out the back door can't breathe so we get it squared away so i've been down there friday and saturday you know in the house like i said we i messed up and everything and that's but then now sunday we went down there we i don't know if we had two services but we all went down there and i knew something was wrong with dad because he didn't he didn't want to come come outside i even think hudson might even come around and he he just like oh i won't go back inside we'd all usually what we've done was is we get out on their back porch and we'd set a long ways away but you know we'd all set outside and just talk kind of get my break you know try to say something crazy try to embarrass him like i'm trying to do now of course i'll get to go to the chicken house after this a lot of y'all don't know those stories i'm the only one that's been there i'll tell you that let's say i'm going over let's see sunny and then then monday uh money a mom called me monday morning and said dad want to go to the hospital so i go down there and i help him kind of get ready and you know and i told him i said dad let me tell you something i said i don't care what anybody says you asked him i said you say every word you say is by his stripes i'm healed i said you don't listen to the doctor you don't even whatever they want to say you don't listen i said you say it a thousand times a day anyway [Applause] if i can get back squared away here what was funny was was a guy that came and got him graduated with zach yeah well he's a boy we all know wade knows his mom and dad i mean we all know his mom and dad and everything well he don't i didn't know this anna told me he forgot my name but i mean he was a manager for the football team and zach played and you know he was but he forgot my name so he text his mom to find out my name well he's getting we're getting that in the ambulance i helped daddy get in put him in the ambulance well he's back here in the back well when he first coming you know come out he didn't say nothing to me but when he came out the next time he came out of hamlet so he must have got the text he said hey terrence you know he knew my name what he done was he takes his mom to find out what my name was where he could talk to us well anyway of course daddy can tell you this too they get in the amulets they go back out our road everybody knows where dad didn't live if you go right out there to 52 you can hit 52 and you can go to gil uh gillsville the gainesville and you can be there in 15 minutes well this guy's driving same boy he backs out he goes the bad way he turns left goes the back road he goes the back road if i could just show you how far he went around he went around five to eight miles out of the way he didn't even know where he was going i guess i i presume and then back to the ambulance daddy said i'm just sitting there wondering where are we going we could i could have told you a better way to go of course you know the boy is kind of nervous and he's a he's a good kid but he uh you know he kind of got things squared away but on monday uh let's see monday i got on the roof daddy was having problems with their roof leaking on the outside so as soon as he left mom went to our house he was upset i got on the roof and started screwing he wanted me to unscrew i unscrewed seven not on monday monday tuesday and wednesday i unscrewed 750 screws wait to help me for five or ten minutes one afternoon we'd put i had to throw that one in there but i'd put caulking and re-screw them so i put down 1500 screws with caulking on his roof for three days we'd come up monday he went to hospital you know was all upset and everything tuesday they lost daddy we couldn't fight we didn't know where he was at in the hospital it just so happened that ruth which ruth didn't help as much on that one she like i said she helped mom and dad tremendously while he wasn't not but we've got cousins that work at the hospital penny and john and all of them and anna got a hold of uh penny rebecca and penny and got a hold to find that they had they had moved him and we called up and they said mr dale ain't here no more or he we don't know where he's at but they had moved him you know and nobody knew but john penny found on tuesday which was kind of funny but anyway wednesday this is another trying time lisa called we would call every day to the hospital three or four times and the doctor when i was talking about the when i said the coveted cocktail and i'm not making fun of the doctor because daddy knows the doctor was probably indian more and he would tell me he said terence we've got him on the covet cocktail he will we would get him through he on the covet cocktail every time i talked to him and he would call he was really good they was good about calling really good but on wednesday lisa called up there and they said she got a hold of a nurse and can we check on samuel and they said well his level they go on levels of oxygen so his levels went from eight to ten and so the next level he goes is to the ventilator now all you all know what happened to brother ray montgomery and y'all don't a lot of you may not know but when this first thing came out i hope i ain't taking too much time i'm sure uh when this first thing came out 80 percent of the people that went on ventilator passed away 80 percent of them in march april and all that now it's down to 40 45 percent now but that was what they said and we was on a group text i'm not i don't get involved with that that much wade and all them was on so everything went to everybody and the only thing i said was i said no and i meant it with a big no and if i'd have been a sinner it would have been something else in front of that no i said he ain't going on november wednesday i got off the roof of course that's what we said and i told him i said no he ain't going on no ventilator it ain't gonna happen so i called the nurse got out of his real nurse and she said oh said he went from a ten down to a eight which was good news really good news i said have the doctor call me i mean as soon as he can't she said well he ain't calling i said no i said i want to talk to him he calls me up hey mr terence how are you doing he's still on the covet cocktail but anyway he said he said i don't know where you got this information he said he went from an eight to a five and said he's going home on friday well thursday morning i got up i couldn't get out of the bed i did get up i felt bad i knew it was something wrong i knew that was you know something was going on but and then we talked to the nurse and everything and then on friday we me and wade went and got him and i should have never went i felt terrible in the united states i didn't even he might not even noticed it but i didn't even get out of the car when daddy got there i made the nurses put him in way get all the stuff i just sat there because i was just beat i could not even move my arms my legs nothing was working at that time well i stayed with him on friday night shouldn't have stayed but we started staying and i'll tell you who the heroes are is anna and wade because they stayed with dad saturday sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday when i couldn't stay and i'm the one that's supposed to take care of them that's the way i feel and they took care of him because and it was a blessing because anna didn't have to have school so she could stay with him during the day and wait stayed every night from saturday to thursday and june was an ace in the hole because if one of them got sick she was gonna have to jump in so she stayed away she cooked richard stayed away because of his work uh lisa cook rachel cook everybody cooked you know and in philly we appreciate everything the church done let's get this year over with and get into 2021 [Applause] well there's only one song comes to mind when i was listening to brother terrence give that testimony because you know scripture tells us he's the present help in the time of trouble and you know what no matter what you go through he'll always deliver you in your time of need you've heard the story of paul and silas how they were bound and thrown into jail they kept on praying they didn't worry they were serving god they could not fail well long about midnight god sent an earthquake where the whole foundation began to shake those prison doors [Music] stepped outside yes he'll deliver me in my time of need like those hebrew children from that fire he freed and he fit five thousand with two fishes and bread and he walked on the water and he raised the dead when he stood by daniel in the lion's den he saved moses from pharaoh's man open the eyes of the blind to sing i know that he'll deliver me now it was david my god delivered when before goliath he did stand he took no armor he took no heavens just five stones and a sling in his head is he when running to meet that army he met that philistine man that stood mighty and tall he said i come in the name of the lord i know that mighty man did fall yes he'll deliver me in my time of need like those hebrew children from that fire he freed and he fit 5000 with two fishes and bread and he walked on the water and he praised the dead well he stood by daniel in the lion's den he saved oh moses from pharaoh's man open the eyes of the blind to sing i know that he'll deliver me [Music] [Applause] i'm not exactly sure what key this is gonna be in but i'm gonna do this song for sister joyce because i get back get asked the same song over and over and i'm afraid that if i don't i might get hurt or or something i'm gonna get rebuked or something but she's on hey there's some fights still left in some of them you know i'll let you i'll let you deal with that anyway but uh if y'all know i'm sure y'all know the song y'all just help me out well it's a high way to heaven none can walk up there but the pure in heart it's a high way to i'm walking up the king's highway guess

chains spilling at their feet the door swung open wide oh they knew that god was always right by their side when they're [Applause] [Music] he fell down on his knees he knew that his life went in

doesn't matter it looks bad sometime to us but not to him it's all new everything's good we appreciate our brother coming and ministering for us tonight you just tell him how much you appreciate it because i do i believe he believes it amen i do i believe he believes what he preached because i believe what he preached yeah that makes it work all work out you know in christ amen so then think about it as we end the year up now i'm not responsible for all the things that have been said tonight i will take the fifth and do with ronald reagan see i can't remember because they have told me things of maybe being in the hospital that i don't believe ever happened but that's where it goes you know but at least i can say so you come on and say what did you do i said well i just can't remember i can't remember it's all packs and all that but thank god for healing that's the main thing terence was telling the story of his dad but see in the length of all that he didn't tell see he wound up with the virus he wound up quarantined for so many days there and he had to stay in the lord took care of it though made everything right because that's what we believe in we believe in a healer a savior you know so just kind of move around get everything ready to go all right i was waiting the time because we want to go into the new year until the part of the new year you know when we take the communion in the new year but we appreciate all that's been said done all the music all the singing all the things that has transpired among us and we appreciate all of the kids and their thing this this thing it used to be when we first started this little building here we 1971 we had about probably about 18 people i guess and something like that and well brother colley he he had to go finally to learn music where he could start a song off because none of us couldn't sing or none of us couldn't do nothing you know and also he had to get all of that straightened up and and then but god's been good to us he sent us people that know how to sing he sent us ministers that know how to preach now i'm going to say this and she may not like it but that's all right do you realize that we have one among us playing and she sung a song just that tonight she wrote a lot of songs she has wrote a lot of songs she could be with sherry and easter that's no joke but yet she chose to just be herself still write songs still have a good time doing it man but just not let it run all out well thank god for those type of people stand here and testify the things among them and the way you came and the way everything happened it's it's this is not no haphazard thing it's all for planned for name all working out for the honor and glory of the lord amen because he's the one that'll do it we're promised that we don't have to worry about things we start a year nobody knowing what's going to take place what could take place but that's all right i know who's in charge i know who's going to take care of all of us everything will be done but we just give him the honor and the glory for it all amen we praise him because he's the great i am and that's that's something to think about that we could know about god i remember when i was in the baptist and thinking about that i read the bible i studied it and you know i had a good memory and and and all of that i i i loved the word what i always thought when i'd read that about him being killed and all he ever done was good that's right all he ever done was good all they ever done was bad i couldn't understand that because we were supposed to be the religious people and we baptist we like the prophet said don't tackle them baptists because they know a little bit what they're talking about you know that we wouldn't pay our tithes to the baptist church we did but you know how we paid it we designated it to go to missionary work because i had learned enough from the word that i wasn't going to try to support a church still don't got that same idea just put everything to god and let him take care of it just let him tell he'll take care of it he'll show you what everything is and all about it but we just appreciate you appreciate you coming appreciate the church people for being here and appreciate those out there on the internet because we're getting a lot of response from a lot of the countries and things and never thought that ever happened because when when the brothers here they come to him and ask me he said why can't we go on internet go whatever what you call it y'all called the names of youtubes and whatever uh i i don't know but you know i said but we can't do that because first message i put out there i'm going to get beat to death over that internet about what i'm saying and they went on i said okay so it kept going and finally some of them kept talking well let them listen if they want to listen if they don't want it let them forget it it's okay open up put it on there i thought that we would get you know i thought the mailbox would be stacked full of contradictory things you know that i'd been preached about but you know what i never got a one never got a a person to write in and say you're wrong and i thank god for that because i believe it's the word i believe he's took care of us all of these years and everything's done we enter a new year we're here you're passing the time now so come on brothers and we'll have to have the communion and everything so just do as you're told that white's gonna just do as you're told and trying to line up and do it and we'll be through it all and just everybody take care on the way home be careful and all like that because you know it is a night out there but we're up here celebrating jesus christ let the world do what they're doing so let's just turn it over to them okay amen it's a new year 1201 so here we are and and this year if you want if the lord carries um watch night service this year coming up 2021 will be the 50th right this will be the 50th anniversary year of our church being established in july the 4th 1971. so we're in our jubilee year golden jubilee not just jubilee golden jubilee we'll be in our 50th year and i was thinking we were joyce and i are grew up in this church and i was 11. of course she was she was born in the 50s and i was born in the 60s so she was born a whole generation before i was but she's only from november to january older than me but now she's older than me right now so we can talk about it but we grew up in this church and it was a little bitty church and and to see this and and the participation and the and to hear michael sing and lord you probably couldn't even get him to talk when he first when they first started coming to church here you know and you got michael singing and they got all the new ones coming in and and i want to take a just a thought for just a second we've lost some uh this year you know brother um dale roberts and um sister and um your mom then we lost um dick addison and then we lost esther lost her dad this year also so it's it's tough but we're one day closer to home we don't have to look at 20 20 no more it's 20 21. we we looking forward all right man so let's read this in corinthians and and take the communion we're just going to do the communion just regular like we we've always done it so we'll just go from here back there's no one else downstairs so there's nobody down there to direct so we'll just take it up here when we get finished so thank you all like again like i said before all the support all the singing the the uh we couldn't even find a musician joyce played the piano sometimes she was you know 14 years old 12 years old and and brother colley elites led singing and now we've got so many song leaders and uh brother willie we got so much support now to it's just it's a lot easier job but you stay with the word of god he'll put the people in the place that needs to be there amen and give our pastor wisdom to put them there and just let them do their job amen so let's read this paul says for i have received with the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he give thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dew in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this duty as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes you know the old saying is is what you're doing the first day of the year is what you do the rest of the rest of the year so let's commune with the lord let's take the communion every day of our life make a recommit recommit it's like like brother willie said you know roll let's roll our sleeves up this year and let's let's let's get out of here amen because jesus said he wasn't going to drink or eat until we come back he's going to eat it with us he thought so much of us brother william he's he's not going to eat or drink any of this until he does it with me and you he was looking forward when he picked that cup up he was looking at the people in the upper room but he was looking at a bride that was inside of him but like you said now he's in the bride and we are partaking of what he has said right here for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that he didn't drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world thank god for that wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger let him meet at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come let's just take a few moments of silent prayer terry prophet of god said pray for your pastor lord we ask you just bless the lord the ones in this building the ones lord on the internet the little bride all around the world lord we pray that you would touch each one and that this year would be a true communion lord closer to you father we ask these things in jesus name amen the bible said he took the bread blessed it dear heavenly father we ask you to bless this bread lord i just made my holy hands lord it's not made with any extra ingredients lord but it's your body and it was broken for us lord this due in remembrance lord of you father yes we take this lord and we ask you to sanctify it in jesus name amen just think 50 years i was 11 years old terence was about i was born yes you were 1964. um anna was not anna was roaming around in the loins of abraham over here but just think how we've come this far though and not just our natural family but church families all come together and we just consider everybody one and we don't uh that's right we know i like what brother claude always says he says there's no great ones among us that's right there's no great ones no big eyes no little use we have offices that we have to go that we have to do right but other than that we're all human beings trying to live a good human life like you said and let the lord direct us into what we do amen let's bow our heads heavenly father we ask you lord to bless this wine lord he gets better with age and father we pray lord that the word of god this year will truly get better with age lord we've all come up to to a time now lord where we're all getting physically older but i pray lord that we'll grow up in you and that statue of a perfect man this year lord that will not be children running to and fro lord as the bible says lord but we'll be able to eat strong meatloaf that this that this thing will culminate lord and a bride that'll stand on our feet and have the word of god to speak through her mouth father we ask lord the power of this wine lord as we for take it lord that it'll just take and sanctify each one of us in jesus name amen amen you know as they're as they're giving out the communion it's uh it's been a privilege to stand in front of y'all this year from my perspective it's it's just it's been wonderful to see the young people grow see brother zach go from disappearing to sitting on the front row that's why i did i disappeared for a while and you know you can only run so far if you're a child to god heal he's he's got the hook in you you just don't know it so but to see the young people um like the song that i asked sister trudy we heard that i heard that song and i don't want you to i don't want to get brow beat up here but contemporary songs are not bad i like southern gospel but like that song you think you re you look at the words the words of that song he turns graves into gardens there's not a human being can do that that's right no human can take a grave and make a garden out of it there's no human can take a sea and make a highway like you did with the red sea there's no man can't do that man might be able to burrow under it but they're not going to be able to part it and make it where two million people can walk across on dry land amen only god can do that he's the only one that can do it but his brother william said though he uses instruments he is now in human flesh and abroad and he can turn graves in the garden and take bones can these dry bones live only one man can make them live but that man is not in heaven that's right that man standing inside of you today and like i told them brother whether the other day i said we you know we don't know what's going on next year nobody nobody knows the world is just mystified but the one inside of you does know what's going to happen next year let it speak let that thing out and let it do its work glory listen to that inner man don't worry about all like you said don't worry about dr so-and-so we we talked to dr jesus and we we use his prescription book the gospel amen you know we don't take no pill but the gospel i remember daddy used to make he still makes wine for the church this is his this is his wine but when we were first uh in 71 and on today you know it may be about quarter year now he makes about a gallon every three months because we take communion you know every month but we have a lot of people take communion so god bless you hope you all have a wonderful year i know we've missed some but you know what we're going to see them again and they're in much better shape than we are we're just parted just for a little while but they're there they're more real than we are we just got they're more real than we are and i hope that god lets him look over the portal every once in a while and look down and say come on bride come on bride we want to do this with you we want to do this with you here because this is our possession let's take our communion [Applause] thank you
