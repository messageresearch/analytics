let's just remember sister passy tonight and uh and um in a special way Lord and and we ask your blessings on her and each one Lord that is Lord we ask these things in Jesus name amen we're on the son of man we're on the Philadelphia and church age now for those of you that are that are visitors there was seven Church ages in the Bible they were in The Book of Revelations you can read them for yourself Revelations 1 2 and three you will see that God brought a message to a group of people he brought it to the world but only a group of people is going to receive it all right and only a group of people's going to receive this message and he gave us seven stars in the hand which are seven Messengers he gave us seven Church ages and you and I are in the last one there is no other Church age we are in the leot and church age and boy do not we know we're in leot and church age blind wretched miserable naked and doesn't know it all right but now we're we've come through the church ages and now we're in the Philadelphian Church age which is the messenger was John Wesley and we'll talk about that just a little bit so let's read our scripture that we've been reading Revelations 1:1 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha what is that Alpha is the Greek first letter Omega is the last so it's I am the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia now we want to compare that too with with Paul Paul sent messages and letters your whole old Test newest Testament he got the Old Testament wrote letters to churches in the New Testament and that was the Bible that was the Bible being written when he' send something to the Corinthians that's what was in the Bible when he send something to the Ephesians that was in the Bible so this was letters so there's nothing new about sending letters and send it to the seven churches which are in Ephesus smna pergamus thar Sardis Philadelphia and leosa and I turned to see the voice that spake with me of being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man God has now imorph into his bride that's a big word for you but it's still he just moved over he changed his form because God is one God is one he is not two or three God is one he just moves over into another office just as I am a father and then I am also a son and I'm also a human being I'm one person but I can move over into the different offices I'm a husband different different titles but there's only one name which is my name and which is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we come under cuz he's our headship and that's why we baptize as the Bible tells us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I exactly what Jesus said he said baptize in the name father's not a name son's not a name we've never been through this but I don't see how people are so blind I guess I do and G about the pouch with a golden girdle you may be seated just boed had y'all standing Lord so much you blame him if if Regina ARL be here she'd have been talking about you she said that's old people need to sit down yeah they'll stand up three hours to get in line to ride the Six Flag hello somebody Revelations 3:7 it's just what you want to do amen it's just what you want to do okay what about that group of people in the Bible they found a new piece of the Bible they found a new scroll and they stood for six hours stood for six hours outside to listen to what that piece of paper that they had found said well praise the Lord let's go about three tonight let's see how that'll work Revelations 3:7 says to the angel now here there's a message sent to an angel or a person one man God uses one man for every Church age and he sends that message to that man that man sends it to the people all right the people catch the revelation and then there are pastors and apostles and Prophets and teachers and different ones that catch the same vision and they go forth to the people all right so the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things sayith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth we'll try to get to that this after or this evening I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name see my name right amen man when the name of Jesus Christ is revealed to you that is a name you go all through the Bible and you look at that word says name name the whole family in heaven Earth has got a what a name and it's what Jesus Christ all right has a name you're identified by your name not your title many fathers in here raise your hand for your father we're all father we're fathers right now but there's only one Bob black so I said Bob black so everybody knows I'm talking about him many fathers I say father everybody goes what but if I say brother Bob black I'm speaking to you directly that's a name attached to it and that's why the whole family in heaven the Earth name Jesus Christ we are even M Jesus Christ that's why we don't take on some other name when we get married we lose our name and you become who you marri too and we know that spiritually to be Jesus Christ behold I will make of them the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come in worship before thy feet to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world we'll get into that not next week end but not tonight keep you from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon what all the world so it's promised we're going to be tempted to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown to him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God remember God's not a name am I preaching to the right congregation tonight okay thank you thought I may have moved out and somebody else moved in and I will write upon him the name of my God God's not a name it's an object of worship God's Got a Name is Jesus Christ which is New Jerusalem and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem not the one over there now New Jerusalem which comes down out of Heaven from my God I will write upon him my new name he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches so we have our chart and I want we're going to we're in that age where it says John Wesley the age started in 1750 to 1906 John Wesley was the messenger and we'll read about him in a minute but you see Luther and Wesley they're very powerful men because what happened was is during that middle age number four see how dark it is that's a darkness of the of the of the depths of Satan but it's coming out of it to come out of it you need a strong men like Luther and Wesley but remember they are reformers not prophets so they can't so they can't take every Doctrine and make it correct they just don't have enough strength to do it but you and I have that strength to do it now we have we have the four combat Beast the lonox man and Eagle we'll get to that in just a second and remember when you talk about a um a church in the Bible a lot of times the Bible is brother Chris was preaching Sunday script has a dual meaning it can have a literal meaning and it can have a spiritual meaning all right so same way with this the dominating Church which was a dominating female if you'll read I'll promise you if you'll read The Book of Proverbs it was written by who Solomon with a thousand wives he knew something about women maybe not so much mother-in-laws but he did know about women and he told you a lot of things to be careful about a woman remember it's better to live with an Ox in your house and a brawling woman I'm just telling you what he said let's take that spiritually though cuz what happened was spiritually Satan got into the weaker vessel did that not happen in the Garden of Eden Satan didn't go to Adam and say hey Adam I got a new program for you he went to Eve and said Eve I got this new program for you and she took it same way with the church there's this new program and guess what Satan presented it to the church and they took it now church and bride is two different things everybody with me there's churches all over the place but there's only one bride of Jesus Christ and she is not a dominating female you and I are all female in the body of Christ see there's your dual meaning we're all feminist in the body of Christ we have a head which is Christ and we do what he says we don't dominate him see the world out there dominates him they don't tell me what to do come on somebody don't tell me what to do I know what I'm a cat no I feel like a dog they can't even be human anymore you think that's nor everybody thinks that's normal you know that's normal it's not normal it's perverted and it's Satan he made a man a man and a woman a woman man never had a baby ever so there's a difference in the two species or the two Sexes okay just for the new people so now there be a question now let me explain something I'm trying to slow down a little bit because of the ones here that's that's that's new and fresh God wrote Seven Seals in the Bible in the Book of Revelations Revelation 6 and 8 what happened was that he there was something that he wanted to make private or secret until the end time all right so he sealed it up and put a stamp on it and you could there was something written but you couldn't see it even Paul said I look through a glass Darkly I'm looking through into something but I can't make out the words it's kind of fuzzy kind of like my new glasses if I take my new glasses off y'all fuzzy but I can still hear you see there so there was seals that was there was something in the Bible sealed up that man had never looked on before and then what happened in Revelation 6 verse1 the lamb opens the seal shows it to John and shows John symbols everybody with me symbols horses ox man Eagles leopards all that it's a beautiful picture if you look at it and know by Revelation but it is hard to understand if not by revelation right all right Angels where are they what are their estate where did they fall from what are they there are no women Angels they're all men all those different things that we praise God that we had a prophet to tell us in the end time and then we looked in the Bible and said man that's exactly what he said amen so we thank God for that but there was some there was something sealed up well during these Church ages there was a there was a Ministry loosed in every Church age Paul was the first church age messenger that was a message loose from God Paul caught the mind of God and spoke what God Said all right so if we're Christians we should be very very very used to that if you're a Christian because we live by somebody catching the mind of God and speaking it by Revelation and then you catching it by Revelation all right but now remember God can't speak anything he hates false Doctrine so you won't get a false Doctrine out of God because if there because Satan can do the same thing Satan can get in this head too this is his playground greatest battle ever fought right here not out there right here he can get in and muddle it up and you can speak something that's wrong right that's right that's what happened in the in n and the different ones they they went to NAA as a one true and living Living God Doctrine as a water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I proved it to you I read it to you in all the even in your history it shows you that the baptism was according to Lord Jesus Christ until they changed it at n Rome well who changed it did does God change does God make a mistake God's perfect he never made a mistake so he didn't go oops I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that uh he's not like us when he when he thinks it he speaks it it happens and I depend on that you should depend on that you should put your soul faith on that God never changes that God never makes a mistake every move he makes is calculated before the foundation of the world so it does not bother him when things happen he knows they're going to happen so there's a ministry that's loosed and it's loosed in stages God is a gracious God that he just doesn't as we even in high school and and or in grammar school we're sitting in grammar school and we were we're learning 1 plus 1 is two and and John and Mary and spot go to town I'm sorry some of you young kids don't know what that is but it was a reader book that we used to read out of and it was John and Mary and spot who was it Dick and Jane I said Dick and Jane Dick and Jane is spite thank you for the preachers on the first second row but but that's what we had when we were growing up but now we left that right we left that and got into something a little bit deeper right we didn't lose the foundation but we didn't we weren't we didn't go to high school in ninth grade and you got the same reader you got in kindergarten no it the the the curriculum changed why did it change to help you develop cuz we're going to get into that when we talk about justification and sanctification I found something a little bit ago that that's really going to help you if if we get to it but I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so one of the seals had to be open so that we could see what was going on and there was four combat beasts according to the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel said that there was a lion ox man and Eagle everybody with me lonox man an eagle and those were anointings one Holy Ghost but those were anointings are powers to help us through life or to help someone through a dispensation a lion a roaring line in the first two or three Church ages to where they could speak boldly and got to back them up but now you come to the fourth age and we see the fourth age the second beast was an ox and he was very powerful but yet slow all right but that was needed in that age that it was sent to which was the fourth Church age and then there was a red horse went out or a power went out to actually literally kill kill people and if you look back in your history this is not something that is hidden but if you read Fox's book of Martyrs 68 million Christians were killed by the Roman Catholic Church during the Dark Ages about 1500 years they prove it they say they did but they say they killed them because they weren't their Christians and that's exactly what it was they were true Christians being killed by the Catholic Church literally killed them and then killed them more by their Doctrine cuz that Doctrine is still here today come on somebody that doctrine that Doctrine rode all the way up to this day right here where they still do the no venience and they still do the uh you know pay so much money and get you know get Uncle get Uncle Ray out of purgatory he's burning down there you got to give him some money if you ain't got enough money give a son we'll get him half the way out silly but it's what they go by there's no such thing as Purgatory show it show it to me in the Bible there nothing they worship Mary show me that in the Bible good grief Mary had to go to the upper room to get the Holy Ghost so the fifth and sixth age which is where we're at now trying to hurry my way back up to here so there was a third seal open and there was a third Beast stood up and said which was in in the it was in the uh form of a man which man is what intelligent all right a lion is is intelligent to a degree but it's a brute Beast all right an ox is in intelligent to a degree but it's a beast all right but man has come up now we've got some intelligence going on here and we've got some real intelligence where something can be developed but let me tell you something that person on that black horse he wasn't developing the truth he was developing error he was developing the false Vine he was developing the false Church Satan wants the church Satan wants to be in church he's in this one now if you're not born again you brought him with you sorry we'll get into that in a few minutes a Lo Black Horse and he said him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast saying measure of wheat for a penny and see thou measure Bary for a penny see thou you not hurt the oil and wine God spoke himself and he said listen the Holy Ghost is going to come out of this age and going to be strong in the next age coming oil and wine signifies the Holy Ghost right and the power the Holy Ghost and the power behind it now the black horse rider that was the Antichrist but one Speaking was represented by a man so now you got Luther and Wesley and during those two periods of time if you'll we don't have them up here but on those two periods of time man it was like accelerated growth accelerated um intelligence they went from horse and buggy and then they come up 1906 they had cars so they went from horse and buggy to some cars and then not a plane to an airplane and different ones all the way up well listen as man move God's already moved man don't move and then God reacts God already knows what you're going to do he's already there to react before you even get started so Martin Luther he sent a man named Martin Luther on the scene and Martin Luther is considered as the most influential figure in Western and Christian history why he he was listen he was just like Moses Moses went to the back side of the desert he was one man he actually was convicted of murder he killed an Egyptian he run away well 40 years later here he comes back a oneman Invasion army with a stick and a donkey a woman and two kids yes right that looked healthy but that's exactly what he did but that's exactly what Martin Luther did Martin Luther took the little bit of the word of God he had and he said I am going to go to the largest group of course he came out of that of course Moses came out of Egypt too right remember for 40 years Moses was tutored by Egyptians right all right so he that he had that mentality in his head already so he goes back loses all that meets God at the burning bush and the God tells him says go on down there Moses and take over make sure you take that stick with you and you're going to go down there and take over so so Martin Luther Martin Luther what he get he got the word of God the just shall live by faith not by no venage not by Penance not by going to a priest and and have him um um prepaid for your murders that's what they do pay them a little money and go to confessional booth and then you go out and do your business it's just all garbage but we know that but there's billions of people that are Catholics and there's some good people in there really are some really good people they're just they're just blind though because if you become part of that system you're part of you get caught in that system then that's your fault same way with us if we get caught in a different system it's our fault I'll read something to you in a minute about that but Martin Luther he come comes out and he takes and he says all right Catholicism everything you built on and I was a part of it so I know your system see God took a man out of the system so he can know what the system was he took Moses out of the system to give Moses a chance to look and it' be very familiar when he went back to Egypt same way with Martin Luther he comes out he goes back puts a thesis on the wall and he says come out of her my people the just shall live by faith not by anything else amen and he turned the world upside down he started a re Reformation or a protesting of one of the largest um denominations I guess or Christian supposedly Christian uh part of the era of the time he was in he went against them right he read this scripture right here I'm sure Galatians 3:11 but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith and they were reformers the prophet of God tells us that he was a mighty preacher teacher of the word assisted especially in his first years of public Eminence that the word was the sole criteria so he was against works as a means of Salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he about the mediation of Christ apart from man was the original and Pentecostal concept so he caught the revelation of the word of God for his time and for his day and the just shall live by faith so that seed that was planted in the ground that went in the ground in that fourth Church age it was getting ready to bring life back up it was getting ready to put two shoots out it was beginning what to bring that plant back to where what man can see it you can't see a seed when it's laying in the ground it's covered it's hi but once it pops up you can see what it is and you see the characteristics coming up and that's what it was and God was pleased to dwell in that position he was pleased to dwell in Martin Luther just as he's pleased to dwell in me and you it's just that me and you have a different responsibility than Martin Luther we have Martin Luther plus everybody with me that's right so the doctrine of justification let's just cover it now so I won't have to miss it the word justification everybody with me everybody with me I'm up here I'm not down here or back under I'm right here look this way thank you pay attention in church you may learn something justification is the act by which God all right so that rules everybody else out that rules everybody else out all right Pope priest preacher Pastor the act by which God moves a willing person hold on a minute there's the key a willing person from the state of sin which is Injustice ice to the State of Grace which is Justice and justifies you everybody with me but now remember a pardon is not a paron until it's accepted as a pardon God didn't don't just justify you because he went to Calvary and you're just absolutely Justified the will of the person you're free will ask God to take your past sins and listen and not just cover them eradicate them everybody with me that's justification baby form where you realize you lost you realize you need somebody to erase your past and God will erase your past if you'll listen to him now listen that's erase it in here not here cuz this is the battlegr this is where God says you're Justified you say praise the Lord Satan says you did so and so you did so and so I was there when you did it I'm going be what somebody said the other day I want to be the one that kicks him into the hole I want to be the one that kicks him into the hole I hope he's screaming and kicking and got cancer and diabetes and all that other stuff hanging on him I'm sorry I wish he could get saved but he can't right he made his choice before the foundation of the world wow so there's no good justification is no good until accepted by that person so Martin Luther is saying look you've got to put all your trust in Jesus Christ put all your faith quit looking at at a church quit looking at this quit looking at that look to Jesus Christ and God counted that as righteous in that church age but now me and you it declares us righteous for the moment everybody with me it declares us righteous for the moment because the unclean Spirit has not left yet it's still there and it will still motivate you to do the same thing you did the day before you got saved that's right we're not trying to reform you we're trying to get you saved and let God change you there is no Reformation in Christianity you can have all these programs you want and that's fine we've got some friends that are that that do that 12-step program for alcoholics but they'll tell you up front you're an alcoholic don't go to the bar well I thought you trying to help these people I promise you you get under the power of the Holy Ghost one day and those things I used to do I don't do them no more I don't have to go there I don't want to go there the one that did make me go there ain't in there no more that's true cleaning out and putting the Holy Ghost in you can't teet her on the edge can't play with God we'll get to that back in just a second I I wanted to clear that up it's the act that God moves a willing person from sin Injustice to the State of Grace which is Justice all right so remember Luther was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like Paul who was both Apostle and Prophet Martin Luther was not a prophet he did some things as a prophet he healed the sick all those different things he had miracles in his life but he wasn't a prophet of the word he wasn't a word Prophet right he had the word for his time I've not found your works perfect before God that's the reason there's a church it's a temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty works that he did came back upon the church church at Pentecost so that they did the works that he did now this age did not have those works oh they had the written word but not the revealed word that was the Reformation period or that was what we call an unfulfilled time during Martin Luther because he didn't get all the way out he still took doctrines that were in the Catholic Church held on to them but then brought the new that just shall live by faith all right let's skip through this so the meaning of not perfect is what unfulfilled now I was thinking yesterday as we were studying back before you going to have to go back in your mind but remember when we come to the part to where Church in state married all right which was which was Constantine took religious Rome and civil Rome and put them together all right every by with me there was a marriage there was a marriage during that time of church and state which is what the depths of Satan but praise God brother Bob in the end time there's a marriage of Jesus Christ and his bride that's going to bring God back to the Earth not false Doctrine that's mine and your commission that's what we're here for we're here to get married we're here to get married with Jesus Christ though not get married with civil out there and the world out there we're supposed to get away from that everybody with me but praise God that's our that's our uh command to marry Christ and then do his bidding here not marry church and state back again no no no that was the bad that was That's what Satan wants to do and he's still doing it now he brought it right up to here but listen L God brought his bride right up too praise the Lord he's got a bride he'll have one in every Church age and even though deep dark whatever it is out there today there's still a church age there's still a bride that is sitting in that age but she's called out into Heavenly places only in Christ Revelations 18:4 says I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her her now what's her we go back to her and woman we go back to church come out of that church my people and be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues amen God hates false Doctrine we should hate false Doctrine we should love the people but not partake of the doctrine that they have caution yourself when you listen to Doctrine check it by the Holy Ghost that's inside of you and if you don't have the Holy Ghost be careful you will get caught in that Doctrine but remember Satan can't cast out Satan Satan loves Satan so if he's inside of you you'll love that thing now look the Holy Spirit has been bound by denominations for 2,000 years now notice the seven sabbaths they couldn't get all the way out as we were explaining the other day back in the Old Testament you had seven years that you would work and then at the end of that seven years there was a release there was certain things went back to zero not everything right so you counted seven of those years 7 * 7 is 49 or 49 years at that 50th year everything that you bought sold in debt everything went back to zero right that's what we're looking for that's our Sabbath day it's not on a Sunday or a Saturday or a Wednesday or a Tuesday or whatever am we're looking for that day when we can be released where everything can be released will it release you of your problems no sorry it'll show you how to handle them though you won't get all that wowy wowy woo junk going on if something comes your way and it ain't right mortar blows up to me that's just Murphy's Law if you don't know Murphy just do something he'll show up at your house ask Dave Ramsey he'll tell you about Murphy's Law when you do something Murphy will show up so let's kick Murphy out well you listen what did Paul say when I do good Evil's present hello when I do good evil is present right amen and other words you're not immune from that we know where it's at though and we know his tactics we should and we know what to do with it when he starts to make a move right amen flee from the thing so the first three ages brought us the pure word of God the fourth Church age went into the ground the word went into the ground at nah it got eat down or eroded but God said I will restore Jesus said promised right here except a corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it will abide alone but if it dies it bringeth forth you and me you and me we're the fruit Jesus said I am the what Vine you're the branches where does the fruit grow on not the trunk it grows on the end of the vine right I mean the end of the branches but Vines if you want to talk about grapes so something had to die so that something could live in all of Christianity something has to die so that something can live right you have to die out to yourself so Christ can live inside of you not divorce not like I said reform or or suppress we're human beings try to suppress something all of a sudden one day it'll go oh I'm sorry I'm preaching to the wrong people pray for me when I do good evil is present but we deny that right Joel says I will restore to you we are in a time now of restoration now we know that Luther and Wesley were reformers but they began the restoration process to get us back to grain again that went in the ground now listen who was the seed that went in the ground Jesus Christ except a corn of wheat die and go on the ground and ab B alone amen but if it comes forth it'll bring forth what much fruit and I will restore to you the years that the Locust eat cankerworm caterpillar polymer or my great Army which I sent among you which is the same bug in different stages so moffit's definition was I will make up to you for the years or I will repay you for the years listen God doesn't owe us anything but to take you home to Glory he's repaid your time he repaid brother Dale's time yes sir he put him in a condition that the devil can't even get nowh don't even know where they brother John that place ain't even don't even the devil ain't even been in name many places on this Earth the devil ain't been in remember he told Jesus or God asked him said where you been he said oh I've been walking up down the Earth I've been walking through the Cs of fire I've been visiting your kids he said have you considered my servant job amen right but we're going to look and see now as we go into this Reformation we're going to and see that God give us a word now of progression to bring us from Shoot To Branch or shoot to stalk to tassel to full corn there's something going that's going to be a progressive revelation just as in Ezekiel 47:2 the water was to the ankles took them out a little further to the knees that's what we're trying to do that's why brother Chris and and brother Mike and all the different pastors around the country they're trying to get their people out in the deeper water I hope they are if not you're going to be shallow at the ankles but you're still going to be in the water can't deny it but if I want to go swimming I can't do it in ankle deep water you can't either but God gave us a revelation showing us that we can go to the ankle the knees the loins the head swim in the water so that's what he give us he started in that first church age to reform the Christians back into believing what Paul believed but they couldn't get everything because remember I am Alpha and Omega I'm going to bring back not in the second third fourth fifth or sixth age but the alpha bride is going to be the same as the Omega bride the Omega bride is going to be the same as the alpha bride the only difference is we're not plus they were plus because they were plus the next Church age that's right we have to come to a seventh seal end that's from a long way from now but we have to come in this age you have to realize we've come to an end a seventh seal end of all things where there's silence in heaven Satan don't know what to do with you now brother R tells us about the last three Church Ages which we're getting into of course we got one already done and getting ready to get in the other one now now that three elements that worked in those three Church ages now we're talking about Luther Wesley and Leota with a small little Pentecostal age in between that's what it takes to constitute the full birth so God God's brought the new birth in the old in in Paul's age now he's going to bring the real revelation of the new birth back in our age remember Luther's birth was he was justified by faith and he believed that he put his faith fath in that and the people that were with him put their faith in that that's what put them in the body of Christ they believed what their Prophet said or what their teacher he wasn't a prophet but they believed that that new doctrine Catholics never taught it right Paul did because he wrote it right but he got eroded down through time man had jumped in and put his idea in in to where now you got to pay for your justification you got to do the penants you got to you know do the hell marriage you got to do the rosaries and all that stuff no Martin Luther said no the just shall live by faith it says it right here in his Bible and it's free it's free you just believe what God's already said it's free so I'm telling you tonight if you don't know anything about God start with justification say God I'm done amen right I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired forgive me of my sins and he is what just to forgive you if you really ask him there's a difference in getting caught they were but now look they were only conceived as a little germ so it had to start in baby form a womb of a mother the Holy Spirit coming to birth now what about a birth of a a woman when you when you birth a child sisters water breaks then you got blood and life all right water breaks justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost listen when that water breaks you going to have that baby right normally normally now there's there's instances but when that water breaks you better get to the to the to the hospital or wherever you need to go cuz something's to happen there's something heading toward something all right that thing wants to get out and there's life waiting on them to get out come on somebody y'all go to sleep if you want to but Heavenly days the new birth ought to be the most exciting thing in your life Don't Clap cuz some of just asleep you'll wake them up it's a fervor you got to have a fervor did you not get that this weekend you got to have something that somebody else else don't have you might have to have something that your neighbor sitting there don't have but there's something got to be inside of you that says that ain't nothing but the truth but you got to be able to carry forward that's right well tomorrow's Thursday all that I got Wednesday like a balloon right Sunday Monday tie that thing off talk about babies tie that thing off but look if the Pentecostal message was the last message which justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the last three messages the last three Church ages forms the complete birth now listen that's what you and I had to have there had to be a baby born right not saying these were wrong but God said whatever was happening in the first age has got to happen in this last Church age the complete birth we got to know when we're Justified we got to know when we're Sanctified we got to know when the baptism of the Holy Ghost FS our fills our soul brother R said just like when a woman is having a baby first thing happens water next thing blood next thing life when they killed Jesus At The Cross what came out of his side water and blood and then the life came out praise God because that was me and you amen amen that's right now watch here's the here's the another Definition of justification it eradicates now watch it doesn't cover it doesn't cover it eradicates because listen God won't dwell in an unclean vessel if he doesn't forgive you of your past sins he can't start working on you amen so you can be so you can be sorry that you got caught and your sins will remain the Bible says a a repentant heart when you really truly say I've had enough God will forgive you of those sins and he will actually throw them in a sea of forgetfulness he won't ever remember them again now the devil might but he won't so look justification is it eradicates by faith in what Christ did at the cross so we had to have faith that Jesus was even alive we don't know that do you know he died do you know where he was buried oh somebody told you but that thing's got to come alive in you and I don't have to go over there and stand at the empty tomb I know there's an empty tomb cuz it's in here I ain't got to go look for like brother Chris or one brother Mike said I'm not looking for relics I don't need a Bell Buckle I don't need a fishing lure amen amen you see how Catholicism just runs right into everything trinkets all that stuff but anyway but it eradicates by faith in what Christ did at the cross the sins of your past nature now look it didn't destroy your nature right it eradicates the sin that was attached to that nature everybody with me all right but remember the guy that did it still there that's right the devil is still there there's no hold on your past it's gone God can't never bring you back up again but now day the next day the next day and the next day if you don't do something that thing's going to come right back up again and you're going to do the exact same thing you did 4 days ago 5 days ago six may take longer than that but listen so that that's why that we had to have a John Westley to come the next Church age and tell us about sanctification which is not eradicating your sin it's taking that thing completely out of you hold on what does Luke say Luke Luke 11:24 says your unclean Spirit goes out why did he go out he was driven out right he loved it just like my cats at home they'll lay down right between our legs and they'll snuggle and you can't get them up for nothing just like you could throw them and they still be asleep Satan was comfortable inside of your soul he was comfortable with the things you did that's why you didn't come to church that's why you didn't come around your mom and daddy that's why you didn't want to talk about the Lord that was uncomfortable with the guy that was inside of you but praise God you go through justification hey I had to realize you had to realize if you're born again today you had to realize God eradicated your sin he eradicated your past because he can't hold anything against you if he don't know what it was and if he didn't get listen if he didn't get rid of everything he didn't come in God don't do halfway stuff you got to give him your all then the outer Court as we were talking about before the outer Court remember there was an outer Court inner court and the holy of holies the outer court if it rained you got wet there was no covering you could walk around there there's many people today brother R says that never went any further than the outer court now watch what he says this will trip you up that's never went any farther than the outer Court the veil yet they are Christians by the millions hold on they enjoy Christ in an outward form amen they go to church with a consolation of knowing they belong to a church Spoken Word Church would you like to realize what I just said they go to church with a consolation of knowing they belong to church but they have never become hid away with him in the inner court amen so there is a difference in being saved and being New Birth or being born again you can have salvation and not be born again believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved I guarantee you you confess your sins if you go outside and get killed in a car wreck you're going to heaven but you're not bride CU God's got to justify something come on God's got to justify something so he justifies you enough to get you into heaven but you're not going to be bride bride is somebody that's connected to it that has a part of him inside of it inside of them part of him inside of them and know what marriage is we connect with each other yet they are Christians they enjoy Christ in an outward form that's why you see people they disappear from church then they come back they disappear then they come back then they disappear God what cloudy days sunny days rainy days rainy days they don't show up when everything's going right or their favorite preacher shows up praise the Lord they'll just come by the flocks they're still in the outter court right they think they got something and it is it's an outward expression but I'll promise you you keep going and that old thing's going to pop up I promise you it will seen it before but they've never been hid away with him in the court cuz if you go to the next part you open the curtain and go into the next part only the priest can go in there now now all of them can't the priest can but the high priest goes on through but priest can go here because they have candlesticks that's artificial light they have some Mana there they have different things that's sanctification that's clean listen maybe there was 250 people in the outer court but now when you go to that middle court only the priest can go in so that does away with a group of people that am I making sense that does away with a group of people in their walk I just got that and their walk but now remember that group of people they don't get to go in the holy of holies only one the high priest walks right by them goes right into that holy of holies they have to stay out here they're clean enough to stay out in here right right but they're not clean enough to go in there that's why you have to be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost amen listen let's worship him in the inner Court let's let's get this Shak kind of Glory back into our life yes sir let's get it where it's just you and God not you and God the preacher where's you and God and you talk to him yourself come to church prayed up come to church and and say God give me something tonight give me something today he'll give it to you but if you walk in here I start to say something if you come in here numb brain you ain't going to get nothing right amen well this Wednesday night can't hard to get you here on church on Wednesday night either man I tell you what I don't I don't know how some people can be Christians and not and and just going to church is secondary I don't see how you're Christian I'm sorry listen hey I'm the shepherd now I got to smell like my sheep so I got to get in there with them but I promise you you're missing God you're missing something God one day may tell you later on in your life and say look I was there that night for you I was coming right to your place and it was empty that's why I want to be it's why brother R said every time the door opens a Christian ought to be in church your soul listen my not my soul everything come on we do we work we play but not Sundays and Wednesdays right become a church amen that's kind of our schedule has been since Dad brought us up as little kids that's what I said we've been drugged all our life we were drugged to church when we didn't want to go but praise God I got part of that inoculation one day and they didn't have toight find me to come to church they found me in church where'd they find Jesus they found him in church amen if Jesus had to go to church sure should we amen well you don't know my problem well we can talk about it but let's go back to the Bible That's Right much more as the day approaches you should be in church cuz you're not going to make it by yourself you're not going to make it alone you will not make it you will fall you will not make it oh real quick let me cover this right here now look let's go back to Revelations 3:7 the Philadelphia and church age to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things sayth he that's holy he that's true he that ha the key of David I'm going to explain that just a second he openeth no man shutteth shutteth no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I am set before thee an Open Door let's stop right there and I'll go to the to the comments and look the word Philadelphia means the love of Brethren I was talking to brother Andre a couple days ago and that's what the problem is now is the love of Brethren if somebody's against you or you're against somebody you don't even want to be around them well that's not the way brother R said that's not the way that right there supposed to be brotherly kindness is you love them more if they're against you right exctly Jesus told us he said pray for your enemies do good to those that despitefully use you know why cuz you Heap coals on his head you do something good to somebody and they're like I hate you why you doing this to me I said I don't care if you hate me or not I've got something to do no what we do is get toe to- Toe with them well which one are they going to see where are they going to see a difference if you're back and forth with them well praise the Lord anyway I Know Thy Works behind th set thee an Open Door no man can shut it thou has a little strength in other words they had a name they were coming out of that system and they were becoming Christians again not like they weren't before but they're becoming where Martin Luther separate John Wesley more separation John was giv us a way of of of sitting in church and having song Service First and having money tithe taken up and having missionary work and going in doing this that was that's why they were called Methodist it was a method of doing a service everybody with me so they had a little strength too but that it was an unfulfilled age in that time too now we know they all lapped over so we know that John Wesley he just built right he took he took Martin Luther's just ification and pulled it up and stacked sanctification on top of it he didn't do away with that justification he knew he knew he didn't say oh now we ain't got to listen to that guy over there he no he said man the just shall live by faith and we got to live a a clean life cuz the Holy Spirit was pulling that out of him in that church age amen and talking about a fervor he preached 800 sermons in one year amen we get about 50 if we're good the sardian church AE started the Reformation that must still go on to the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing till it comes right to the Original Seed we have now come to that point of time we are at the Original Seed time that're going to God said no don't Harvest them now let them all grow up I'll separate the wheat and the tears so let God do the separating all right that's where church was married to the state but I believe now we're married to Christ in this last Church age fully John Wesley was the church age messenger born in 1703 died in 1791 it was John Wesley remember all he was the he was one of 19 children your sisters worry about three or four sister Wesley taught every one of them at home did their did their mama did their drawers hung them up on the line and still taught them how to talk and read if you'll remember brother Rand makes a point here and I won't go too far but I'll finish in just maybe this weekend he was born to Samuel and Susanna Wesley Samuel Wesley was not very well thought of he was a stickler for a method so nobody liked him they wouldn't let him preach they kicked him out of a certain place he come back again they kick him out again but what Happened One Night is all of the kids were gone except John and the house caught on fire he was on the Second Story they run in to see if they can find him or couldn't find him of course everything's made out of wood back then so the wood the wood was falling in and somebody happened to look up through the smoke and what John was doing he was trying to push a piece of furniture into the window to break it well finally they found him they saw him up there and one guy run around the back and come up the backside and and they got down to the bottom to catch him but they threw him out and the man come out because remember brother random says that John West was a fire brand snatched from the fire he literally was but he was a fire brand preacher that put a fire in him maybe we ought to be caught in an upper room with a come on somebody with a fire going off and you can't get out of there by yourself and let God show up and help you out I promise you you'll be a fire brand you'll think a lot different you'll talk different you light different when the fire god hits you I'll promise you that but that's his his father father said John you're a fire brand snatched out of the fire and that lit a fire in him I guess to preach 800 sermons and over 4,000 in his lifetime he bus the stick he did all these different things but they were called Methodist and other titles actually went to Georgia for a little while total disaster though cuz you know what John Wesley did he went over there thinking that he was born again right he he went all the way to Georgia to convert the Indians them heathens to convert them into Christianity he meets the moravians he's so impressed with them they're so Meek and I mean there's a storm coming up and the boat's falling apart and they're just down there singing and and John's probably puking and and um you know not having a very good time but when he comes back to England that's what he said he said I went to America America to convert the Indians but oh who shall convert me he knew he didn't have what those people had I knew I didn't have what the bride had right amen you need to realize that find you some bride get around them that's why I said you need to be in church but back in London he met him again and we keep going again Charles actually said John come on buddy come on brother you were born again way over here and John said uhuh no sir he could un understand how such a spiritual man as John should say that he was not formerly right with God it was however not long that Charles got a fire he was saved by grace the work soon took on such proportion that he began sending out numerous laymen now look it was an Open Door travel was a lot better you could go by boats and different things travel was better so what he would do is he' get numerous people now doesn't that sound familiar Paul did the same thing Paul would go to an area he'd get them all built up he'd get some good preachers in the area and then he'd leave and let them do the work so the same way what was John Wesley doing the same thing he was getting Layman to preach the word this seemed like a parallel to Pentecost where the spirit raised up men with power to preach and teach the word almost overnight of course there was a violent opposition to it remember I told you that time they kicked John out cuz they kicked his daddy out and they kicked John out so John John's Daddy was buried in a courtyard somewhere and and on a mum up this high so John runs over there and jumps up on top of it and starts preaching and the people from the church comes out and said you got to leave he said no my daddy bought this property and now I own it you can't take me off of this do we have that fervor would we would have done you know while you while you watch this right here he could not remember to have felt lowness of spirit for even a quarter hour since he was born none of y'all done that he slept no more than 6 hours a day arose in time to start preaching at 5: practically every day of his ministry preached up to four times in a single day so a year he would average 800 sermons he traveled multiple thousands of miles on a horse as did his circuit Riders who carried the gospel near and far Wesley traveled 45 100 miles per year by horse he must have had a good warranty he was a believer in the power of God and he prayed for the sick with great faith and wonderful results let's skip through this just for a minute I want to get something to you this is what John said now this is where John direct what he could have been wealthy but he didn't his favorite saying was get all you can save all you can and give all you can how strange it would be for Wesley to come back and see the denomination that bears the name of Methodist boy wouldn't he having gay pride weak in them in the church Church gay pride month in the church saw it on YouTube guy standing there with the color flag all behind him and he but look folks that's not deceiving we know that's garbage but what about the deception that eats at us the little foxes that spoil the vine they are vastly rich but the life and power of John Wesley is missing he didn't desire to build a work upon a denomination or sectarian base he was Armenian in his beliefs he did not want to separate from the Brethren on the grounds of Doctrine he was a good candidate for James he based his eternal life on faith and words are the living of the life rather than simply accepting a Creed or doctrine statement so now what's the difference then in what Martin Luther preached and what John Wesley preached listen to me a minute what John Wesley what uh Martin Luther preached just shall live by faith that's it that's it right come over here to sanctification though and watch what John Wesley preached he based his eternal life on faith and works Martin Luther based his on faith alone remember he inter intered the Bible he interpreted his German Bible says by faith alone but you take that and he stood on it and it was part of God but now you come over to John Wesley he based his interal eternal life on that faith and then working through it so what is sanctification justification does what declares you're righteous for that moment declares you're righteous praise God grab a hold of that if that's where you're at but there's more cuz you got to come over here to where the unclean Spirit goes out you got to come over here to where you start living more Godly that the devil hates to be around youen so sanctification is what it's a gradual growing righteousness think about it cuz remember I'll promise you one thing in sanctification there's some of them Devils that run pretty quick and they some of them that claw the walls getting out of your soul well praise the Lord I'm preaching to me there's some of them that it was easy for you to get rid of there was some of you it was hard cigarettes don't you don't mind a while wasn't it Bubba yes sir but it gone but that devil was going chop board and when he he finally gave it up that demon was gone we believe in demons here just as much as we believe in Jesus Christ because they're real and they do influence you but Luke 11 says the unclean Spirit goes out of the man so sanctification is our gradual growing righteousness in that part all right made possible by the spirit of God that's why we got to get under the influence of God not under the influence of a Creed are not under the influence where Satan can hide behind it well I've quit smoking if I got to quit drinking too or in your case I quit drinking I got to quit smoking come on just a little bit more no God knew one thing for sure I never did smoke but I chewed tobacco for since I was 14 I guess and uh he knew that would be rough so the day I get my heart to God the last day that thing any of that ever the desire was absolutely gone now remember there was other of them Devils going but that one was gone just like that the day I came right up here in December gave my heart to the Lord and said I'll serve you Lord just give me some time I walked back out that door I had skull everywhere I had I had my red man and I had all this stuff and I had to and more the devil you know he lets you find it every once in a while you know after about 3 weeks you you find one that you didn't throw out like the you find one you didn't throw out and you're like the unclean Spirit goes out so now we're in sanctification we'll get to the baptism of the holy ghost in a little bit but a Sanctified life is made possible by the spirit that dwell that will not dwell in you but it's getting ready to cuz remember sanctification is what cleaned and set aside for some kind of service clean and set aside for some kind of service I think I got it down right here we'll skip we'll get back to this this weekend let's stand musicians come guess I spent too much time backgrounding I'm sorry cleaned up and set aside for use or a purpose cleaned and set aside for because remember in justification you're not clean hello now what it is is is that them old sins that was on your piece of paper that the recording Angel was recording since you come to the age of accountability it it went to nothing but remember that unclean spirit that made you do it it is going to be with you and it's going to start accumulating again everybody with me but what happens when you get born again that's what your book looks like that's what your book looks like to God not everybody else were like oh you got this and you this this this this what Satan's job he's the accuser of the Brethren when we start loving the Brethren more than Satan hates loves to accuse them we'll get in a lot better place with God pray for our enemies
