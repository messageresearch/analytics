========================================

oh all right last time i talked about able sacrifice so we're going to finish up that taco let's go ahead and turn right agency forward and adam knew eve his wife and she can see and bear cane and said i have gotten a man from the lord she again bears his brother and abel was a keeper she became the tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that came brother and through the ground and abel he also brought a person up his flock and of the fact thereof and the lord had respect and to able to his offer so that they came unto his offer he had not respect and cain was very raw and his countenance failed so last time we talked about why able sacrifice was received and how it was received and how it was a just a perfect type of our walk through justification sanctification of the baptism of my holy ghost and um today i'm just gonna i'm gonna kind of quickly go back through and then we're gonna look at um the the total offering the burnt offering a little bit closer so um let's start off by reviewing uh why abel's sacrifice was received because he got a revelation from god brother brown said in the lamb and the dove what is it then the rock is built upon as the divine revelation of who jesus christ is upon that solid rock christ builds his church and all the gates of hell will never prevail against it when that direct revelation comes from heaven that christ is your emancipator that when he has become your savior delivered and that is anchored in your heart all the devil's information will never make you deny it and that's the foundation for the whole walk is a revelation from god if you've got a revelation then you'll you won't it'll keep you all the way to the end and that's um if you look at romans 8 28 that's what he's talking about when it says that um i'll just read what brother brandon said about it all before you he did call off he called and justified on justified he's already glorified there's nothing out of order we think there is but look in the scriptures it's just getting exactly the way god's word said it was is it not testing a little bit louder justin um all right all right so um that's that's that's the king's highway right there is justification to sanctification and uh how we must have the blood applied now last time we talked about how able has to lay on the sacrifice because he's identified with christ he must lay on the bronze altar and it's the bronze because of judgment that's the same reason that the grass hurt suffering was when you looked at the brass circle y'all seeing already judged um so brother brown said you just have to have the same and then possession gave to the enemy after trial you just have to have the same the faith you've got like you have to start your car or come to church see a lot of people think they got to be something but no no that's wrong just common faith is all you have to apply the blood by hear the word and believe the word apply it that's all just pick up weeds anywhere there in palestine was history just a little weed growed out of the cracks in the walls and around dipped in their blood and put it on the wheel and the door closed people wonder how to get faith all you have to do is just listen to the word put in a from the church and faith will happen and that's uh when you look at the sacrifice there was three things that were burnt for the sacrifice with the burnt offering hyssop which represented common faith scarlet sanctification by blood and seizure which is the baptism of the holy ghost then so he's talking about this common history which is just that we find growing out anywhere just take it and that's what they use to apply the blood on the door first and then we get to sanctification and it's whenever you have a career of revelation from god and obedience always follows your revelation and you can see that with with april he when he believed god he did what he acted according to his revelation by taking the sacrifice and laid it on the altar and that's when you really get there out down to it that hebrews 9 13 says that the blood of christ is supposed to purges our conscience from dead works to serve the living god and it sets our hearts for obedience and when you look in ezekiel 26 or 36 he first he gives us a heart of flesh takes away our stoning heart is our flesh to receive it to receive his word and then he gives us a new spirit that sets us in line to be obedient to it and then he gives us his spirit now charles finney i love this this thing that he said about sanctification the doctrine of justification by faith produces sanctification by producing the only true obedience to the law by this i mean that when the mind understands his plan and exercises faith in it it naturally produces sanctification sanctification is holiness and holiness is nothing but obedience to the law consisting in love to god and love to man brother brown said in a token because if you say you believe and you don't follow the instructions of the word then you don't believe see so and he preached that the sermon works as fake express which goes into that when you believe then you're going to obey by your faith in adoption he says after you approve yourself sanctify yourself with your good behavior obedience to the holy holy spirit no matter what the world says i'm going to rub this really hard see because i don't mean it to be rude please don't don't really see don't really think that i'm i'm mean i don't want to be what worries me is to take people to them god sent truth and they'll turn right back around and just keep on doing the same thing and say they got the holy ghost that just nearly ruined you what's the matter they come right back to the same thing just like the children of israel they wanted a king so this king could rule over them and make them act like the amorites named malachites and philistines so now when you believed what did you do you did according to acts 238 which was go down to the water and be baptized and and acts let's let's look real quick at acts 2 41. acts chapter 21. this sums up what the people that heard peter's sermon what they did they gladly received his word and then they were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls they believed and then they did what according to their faith they were baptized and then they were added just like just like abel he believed did act according to his faith he brought his sacrifice and then his sacrifice was received by consuming fire and there's another little little thing that's very important and that is waiting on god because after you've after you believe and you've done all that god requires you can be confident that what you've done is right then just wait on the lord and the same the same form that applies for healing and baptism in the holy earth because healing is is the baptism of our body with the holy ghost and uh there's a quote in here i have it my brother says your body must be born again that's the rapture so luke 24 49 he said and behold i send the promise of my father upon me to tear you in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and waiting is important because you couldn't wait and this spoken word is original you see that's what that's what's the matter with pentecost today they're manufacturing something they can't wait oh god they just can't wait so they committed those tears to manufacture something and what does it bring forth like it did the first time the first bride that couldn't wait she brought death to a bastard born child which we all our children know but god came in flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to original sons and daughters of god see there you are a life firm of eve never happened it never did why she mingled and kept it away instead of adam coming to earth for a bride when the time appointed would be just like christ would have come to the group christ would have come to his church he promised to do it god promised to multiply them but they had to wait until god's time in wisdom versus faith 1962 he said now you see the seas that she was holy and would have finally become a mother by the will of god through a spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait and he said and then there's here's something else if any person is coming in the prayer line let me sternly warn you if you're aiming to come to in the prayer line do not come until first you give your heart to christ then do not stop at that after you have repented and been baptized terry until you have received the baptism of the holy spirit and at trial 1964 abraham that's a good witness the word never said when he said he would he said i'll give you a child son by sarah not next month never said next month he said he would not win they prayer they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's the idea the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise him up tear you in the city of jerusalem until you're in dude no not for one day two hours ten days ten years until the power comes and the reaction to action ministers your instructors go with it now that don't purpose in your heart that you're not going to come off your knees if it takes from now until saturday night how long shall i terry until you're new how long is until until you receive it i'll just skip over part of that paragraph drive at the devil defeat him he's a defeated person do you believe that he's just a big blood he has no legal rights we are three children born of the spirit of god we have a right to this god's heritage and we believe it and then if you uh if you were able to listen to the last we talked about we walk through the bible how able sacrifice will perceive by consuming fire and that's the same way that our sacrifice is received our sacrifices ourselves if you look at first corinthians 12 13 i'll just read it for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink as one spirit now hebrews 12 29 says for our god is a consuming fire and i'm gonna come back to that first corinthians 12 and a second for by one spirit we are all baptized then the future home of the heavenly bridegroom he said he justified the land sanctified him sent the holy ghost to fire and burnt the sin out of it and dwelt in him himself he does the earth that he's going to use in a plan of redemption the same way he repented and was baptized in water by noah jesus come and sanctified it by dripping his blood on it and claimed it and in the new earth has to come is to have a holy fire baptism you clean it of every devil every germ every sickness everything that there is and make it a new i saw a new heavenly new earth now one of one of the best stories in the bible i think to illustrate this is deuteronomy 9 well all of the stores in the old testament kind of are are natural financial type of spiritual in the new testament so like in the old testament they would actually heal the works of the flesh which were the malachites and the anakins and in the new testament we get our on our knees and ask the lord to fight our battles so this now this is um been going into the new land and god is going to tell them how what's going to happen to the animals and and to keep it in context back in in uh numbers when they went into cash cornea they crossed over jordan because the spies went across the land and they saw some of the people over there were the anakins the anakins were these big giants and they said we can't we can't take it um so now let's let's see what happens after they cross third hero israel that our pastor for jordan this day to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than myself city's great and pitched up to heaven of people great and tall the children of the anakins whom thou and of whom thou has turned say who can stand before the children of the net understand therefore this day that the lord thy god as he was healed whatever before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shall thou drive them out and destroy them quickly as the lord said unto thee speak out loud thy heart after the lord thy god had cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lord brought me and possessed this land but for the wickedness of these nations though the workers drive them out from before thee not for thy righteousness but for the uprightness of thine heart this is our good represents their land but for the weakness of these nations the lord thy god is driving out from before and that he may perform the word which the lord's swear to thy father is abraham isaac and jacob so that's when you think about what's the what's the difference between sanctification and baptism that only goes for because they're both a cleansing work sanctification cleanses you to put you in line to serve the lord but the holy ghost purges you of withdrawals and sin and just like just like how the consumed fire went before the children of israel and drove out the animals from the land and just looking forward one day one of the children of the anakin named goliath stood before nathan and david had the same faith that these for these children did and know what happened there in israel in the church when the believer in 1953 when the believer firmly believes in the lord jesus christ god is under obligation to give him the holy ghost confirmation of his faith say what's the matter brother random just your faith that's all if you surely believe god's there to give it to you while peter spake these words the holy ghost fell on them that heard the word is that right acts 10 49 all right notice the holy ghost and fire came from heaven burn out all the cross circumcise the heart cut off all the surplus and become a new creature and draw us as anything that's not supposed to be there when you look at deuteronomy 9 the anarchists weren't supposed to be there drawls is when you when you melt a chemical like a metal like 10 or something then the dirt comes up at the top and that's drops and they take it out so the sooner fire will get rid of everything all the inpatients the uh temper tantrums um and it leaves behind patients and all these technologies and influence 1963 did you notice god cleanses his prophets by fire not by theology or a book of some kind see he cleans his people by fire holy ghost and fire not by declaration of creeds or books or something you've got to learn a bunch of prayers and so forth he cleans him by fire off of the office that's how he sets him in order yeah yes sir that's it that's how he cleans his prop cleans his prophets at the beginning with 120 was in an upper room the holy ghost fell and tongues of fire set upon it they were cleansed and ready for service not by learning get a bachelor of art or dd phd you're getting holy fire from heaven that takes the lying off of your lips and takes the carnality out of you burns that stuff away that draws to the world and puts his presence in there and lives through that person so we've got just a few more minutes let's get into the whole burnt offering the whole offering was when it would go on the offer it because it's called the open offering was completely consumed and when you normally they would come and offer this uh one sacrifice but if if the overall offering was combined with another sacrifice the order was the sin offering would be off the first then the burnt offering and then the peace offering and isn't that just perfect that you believe in the sin offering is offered in the burn offering and then you're at peace with god um so let's take a look a little leviticus chapter one we're not going to read that because it goes into the what the whole current offering is but um leviticus chapter six verse nine let's take a look at that command aaron and his son say this is the law of the burnt offering it is the burnt offering because of the burning upon the altar all night into the morning and the fire they always shall shall be burning in it so in other words it's going to be totally consumed my brother brandon said in some quotes how they like where last time at the offering the burnt offering was not completely consumed and it was not received so they have to leave it leave it on the altar they cannot take off any unburnt piece if um from what they will do if you look at some of the how the history of the offerings they would the next morning if there was anything left especially during the well during the the big sacrifices they were bringing 100 000 offerings a week or whatever then they would pile all the unburnt into a big a big heap on the in the center of the offer the altar was huge probably bigger than this room just to give you an idea so they would pile it all into a huge heat and that was called the apple and because they couldn't take it off until it was completely consumed leviticus chapter 6 verse 12 13. paul's already hit chapter six now i remember we talked last time about how uh after moses offered his sacrifice after he god told him how to set everything up he got everything arranged and god consumed the first sacrifice the same thing with solomon uh and on down food all that all the bible so so the question might come up what if you offered an offering after that did god consume your your offering in the same way so let's see he shall uh verse 12 13 and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it it shall not be put out and the priest shall bring wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering and order upon it and he shall burn there on the battle of the peace office the fire shall ever be burning upon the offer it shall never go out so what i'm getting at is the same fire that fell at pentecost it's the same fires burning in me today and you know brother brown said he was talking about the greater works that when jesus was on earth he said he couldn't really talk about the holy ghost because he's not a sympathetic father yet but now we can say i've got it and you can have it and uh it's the same fire that the same same consuming fire story goes all the way from the bottom and then just real quick we're running out of time in leviticus 10 native and by who took streams fire and put it on the offer and brother brandon said in revelation chapter four oh for man tried to go in the holiest of holies someday somebody some bible teacher tell me that somebody started into this holiest of holies without coming through here to die sons took strange fire one day some denominational fire when it wasn't the nomination of fire and they died at the door is that right or eli's sons it was i believe sometimes took the man on representing his undergraduate and they went out fire from the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord must be god's consuming fire that purges us from the hand we're out of time thank you lord i'm fired now
