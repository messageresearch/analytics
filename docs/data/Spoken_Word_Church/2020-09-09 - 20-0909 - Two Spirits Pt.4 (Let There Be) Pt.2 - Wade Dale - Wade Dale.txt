holy holy [Music] holy holy i want to sing amen good to be in the house of the warden you look up and open your eyes you think you're in the hospital got all these where'd that familiar giggle come from oh well i thought it was aaron roberts i sounded like aaron was back there behind me i guess not all right good to be in the house of the lord good to have everybody here on a wednesday night good to see the new rep family i can't say i see you smiling face but i see you smiling faith we're good to have each and every one of you here and uh boy we've come to a place that uh everybody in the world prayer request is so long you can't hardly remember it and you you pray until midnight almost literally trying to call everybody's name and sometimes you just don't get there because there's so many uh brother joel is still fighting this thing be 60 something days and um now um there's another strain of virus going around so satan is the prince and power of the air right and this is where this is all it's all traveling but we're going to pray that we are going to be filtered that god's going to filter this now we got to live in it got to breathe got to eat got to touch doorknobs we got to go to work we got to do all these things but we pray that god will help us and protect us and keep us safe amen we believe he'll do that right amen so remember we're still now in phase two which is what you're looking at now everybody wear a mask except the preacher that's preaching even downstairs all right there's some downstairs now but sunday we'll do the same thing we'll be in phase two we will be at ten o'clock and at two o'clock as usual and then we'll have communion after the second service now don't worry about how we're gonna do it just be here brother dale and i'll kind of decide we'll pray over it all week just to see the safest way of of doing it and then we will definitely have communion though one way or the other amen so that's part of uh that's part of the ordinances that we go through and the part that i miss as much as anything else is to be able to you know brother branham even the bible tells us that if you take communion and you don't have things right in your heart then you could be eating and drinking damnation unto yourself i'll tell you a little story here just for a second i like i told you before we've been we not we me i've been battling some stuff in my flesh for a while you know sickness and not not sickness but enough to bother you and i told somebody at my psa level was up but i went to the doctor and he said don't worry about that and then other little things going on you know but still you you when you lay at night and you still hear that you you're laying there and you're saying lord why are you not moving like your word says said you'll come on the scene you'll heal the sick and i keep hearing that quote where brother brown says one unconfessed sin even brother branham talks about that in the prayer line he tells them to go get it right and remember there was a portion there of somebody that was that was sick and they had to go get something made right brother brown said or that devil is going to sit right there doesn't matter how much oil pour 55 gallon drums of oil all you want to and pray the prayer of faith that's fine but there's a lot of things that we go through in life that sometimes we forget about but i promise you one thing if god ever reminds you of something you better go do it um and this old boy has been a i have accused myself i don't have to be accused of others of being adamant about certain things in the scripture and about certain things in life and about certain preachers and one preacher i've been real hard on in the past and and i called him yesterday no monday sorry it was monday i get mixed up we were off on monday monday called him monday and i said brother i said there's something laying on my heart and i said i can't get an answer from god i said i've talked about bad about you for several years because of certain things you do you did and it was really none of my business i said i just want you to forgive me he said sure brother he said i got no problem he said actually he said bring your bible and come preach for me yeah i said brother but the moral i mean the story is yeah it was hard to find the number i didn't have the brother's number i mean he lived somewhere else and i had to find his number but i kept saying lord something's got to move when we clear this thing out of the way and that's the way you and i ought to do the same thing if we're struggling if we're having problems i don't care if brother brown said if it tears the height off your back to pick up the phone and call somebody that you may have wronged it don't matter if they knew about it because he didn't know i was talking about him i reckon i and and and wasn't any of my business he's not my pastor amen so that's the same way i want to be with any of you i want to apologize for anything i've said this hurt your feelings i don't want to hurt your feelings not anybody in this church i do not want to hurt their feelings i want us to grow up in god and and if you've made if god's made brother dale and myself the spiritual leadership of this church then we're supposed to act like it right and we're supposed to call out things when it needs to be called out but we're not supposed to talk about it in a group over here we're not supposed to talk about even to our wives at home there's nowhere in the bible and there's nowhere in the prophet's message where you're to discuss anything with your wife about problems going on in different places especially in the church everybody got that now i'm not accusing anybody i'm just telling you we i went through listen there's a you say well brother what are you doing you got to put it back to the word because brother brown said that demon will sit right there until you get that taken care of and brother john it was like it was like being born again all over again monday when i hung that phone up that thing lifted off of me and it was oh yeah it was hard but i'll never do it again by the grace of god each and every one of you stick a sock in my mouth if i start talking about i don't want to talk about nobody i don't want to hurt nobody's feelings now what we have to talk about here in this church different matter you misbehave in this church you're going to answer to brother dale so we have to we have to do that but as far as there should be nothing discussed outside of us brothers getting together and discussing it on our own because it'll lay there and that thing's laid there for several years and i paid for it but now we're moving on i'm not saying the problem's completely gone i feel like i got maybe a hernia down close to my groin and when i work and you know me i get up soon as i get finished with my mail route i'm i'm in i'm in the uh in the garden picking okra and everything else and but uh we're going on with god god said if you'll clear the slate so i've cleared my slate how about you can you pick up a phone and call somebody and say brother i'm sorry i've said something about you i've talked about you behind your back and i apologize because 99 of the time it's hearsay it's hearsay right and hearsay is what not admissible in a court of law only what eyewitness now if i witness something and you i witness something you have a right as a christian to say something either to your brother or to your sister but not to a crowd not to four or five people out in the parking lot or call somebody on the phone saying you know what brother so-and-so or sister what am i trying to do we're trying to clear a slate so we can get out of here we we've got so much what did paul tell us he said what get rid of the sin that so easily beset us easily so it's an easy thing to fall in this trap and i'm up here today in front of the world apologizing for for doing that and god forbid that i try to do it again because we should be shoulder to shoulder that's why that thing right there brother donny is up there right at the top brotherly kindness brother branham he was a man that had brotherly kindness you didn't know and i don't believe he talked about brothers i believe he pulled him off to the side and maybe spoke to him but i don't believe he was that way and i apologize for for being that way and i just i sleep better now i feel better just by a phone call didn't cost a dime nothing just a phone call say hey man i'm sorry we're brothers and then the brother just said hey bring your bible next time you're up this way preach for me so you see that was so easy but yet it's so hard what to admit you're wrong to confess your sins mama you know a white girl's name and because she just used a lot of blacks to use different names but anyway i told her i said well you've got a beautiful white girl's name and that haunted me and when i got sick i said we've got to find that number so finally we called and called this one and that know that nobody had johnson's number so finally they they got it and samuel called when i was sick he called and jonathan said well she did think something about it and said but she's all right now so they didn't come back to church after i said that so he said he said that they didn't come because it's too far but you know if it's whatever that's right right that's what we need to do we need to practice if you have anything i'll promise you if you're a child of god i'll promise you god is obligated to bring that to your attention and if you brush it off the iniquity is on you and you will deal with it now whether you go through dry places spiritually or whether he what he lifts off that thing and lets satan play with your body for a little while because see satan's a master at manipulation and he manipulates your body and he'll crawl in your mind and like i said before a couple sundays ago or whenever it was you know you you get this little thing set in here that says you know you're gonna die because you have this and you're gonna but you know what it's a lie it's unfounded it's you know let the doctors do their job and then let god do his job so that's what we're not gonna talk about that tonight but we're still on the two spirits but it does have something to do with those two spirits those two i'm not fighting an adulterous spirit to go out and commit adultery against my wife okay i'm fighting the spirit that's in here and i say in here because it's in all of us that's why i keep i want to keep going back and i'm going back and going back because i want you to understand one thing satan is not some demon that looks like a demon that we paint he's a pretty angel he's beautiful he is an angel of light he will tell you every truth except one word he can't hold that word word for word that's why then i believe when we talk about this this evening we get to it if we don't that's okay on where god said let there be light and there was light you know that light is a form of energy and energy can neither be created or destroyed so brother louise it wasn't that the switch got turned on that light always was there that light not the sun that light was always there because it's what it's energy from god almighty can't be destroyed and eat science even says it can only be changed from one form to another and that's exactly what he did he changed from one form to another to bring that light inside of me and you let's buy our heads the heavenly father thank you for this evening that you give us to be here we pray lord that you'll give us a rejuvenation of strength lord here in the middle of the week on wednesday night we fought the battle for monday and tuesday and part of the day today lord now we got another battle coming up but lord we win regardless of how many fall on the wayside regardless of how many put a sling around their arm and and as we say while uh just wobble their way to the end we made it because you told us that we would make it that there would be no weapon formed against us that would prosper and greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world father we ask you the lord truly to forgive us of our sins and our mistakes that we make in life we're human beings lord but we sh we have a spiritual rudder called the holy ghost inside of us that keeps us checked up that lord keeps us in the right path to where sometimes we might want to do something different and you feel that little check well thank you father for that little check because a bastard child will not get that kind of correction but lord a real child a real son and daughter of god will be corrected and brought back into the way as the prodigal son he was always a son but he had to be brought back he had to get to the lowest of low he had to be where sometimes we think you're not even there to listen lord but we know what you're doing you're training us up you're getting us ready lord to fight the greatest battle that's ever been fought and that's the battle between life and death father give us this day our daily bread be with us take care of us lead us in guide us by your holy spirit through this service you be the speaker lord be the active participant in jesus name amen so just take that little tidbit and see how it'll work it stings but you know what feels good afterwards it really feels good i mean it does you know why because the burden's been lifted i thought jesus said put your burdens on him but there's a way you've got to do that you can't just throw the burden on him and say well i'm not going to repent but here no there's a way to do everything all right there's a way to do everything and we as christians we should know how to live but we do forget i'll never forget i was reading a quote the other day and i'm gonna i'm gonna probably maybe maybe put it back in here brother branham you know he told us and i know you're standing but that's okay you've been sitting for 30 minutes you can stand for 30 minutes brother brown told us he said he said you know we got to this place that we look at things and we go wow you know that that happened that way and we have to realize that all things work together for good uh you know i don't know what brother joel's going through and all the different things that we are all going through but i read that scripture in isaiah 40 and brother brown reads it many times he says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount it with wings they that wait upon the lord amen so we as christians we should know how to do it but what brother bryan said let me get back to that brother bryan said he said there was a holy ghost veil over adam and eve we know that right because they were both naked and they didn't have any sexual desire everything was what pure all right well we have that same holy ghost veil but we have a flesh attached to it after the fall and brother branham says our mind gets clouded he said the earth got clouded after the fall and he said there's a murky fog that's going to stay there remember brother ryan said this thing's going to be sticky all the way to the end that's kind of what he's talking about that murky fog is what the fall that's that's where god can't come down and and change your body yet but but glory to god we're gonna we're getting there and man that cloud's gonna lift that cloud's gonna take off one day and as that cloud lifts we're gonna live with it amen but we gotta learn to live right down here amen brother brown said he said don't preach me a sermon live me one i've done a pitiful job and i apologize but you know what i'm not worried about the past anymore you just continue forward that's the same way you do don't look back just keep going on forgive me lord for what i did it was a test and a trial and if i'd have been a bastard child guess what he wouldn't have been there to correct me because you don't have to because you're not in the family amen so let's read first john the two spirits let there be part two maybe we'll get to this we're gonna fly through this pretty quick this time already took up too much time first john 4 verse 1 says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus has come in the flesh is of god now we know we explain that that's not every drunk or any prostitute that will tell you that jesus is coming to flesh and that's not true that confet that word confettis is logos or the spoken word so that's what we are when you confess by what by that thing that's inside of you by that new birth that's inside of you if you confess that jesus is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist now remember it's so close i keep wanting to go back to the beginning there stand satan and god and if you were to be an onlooker and a bystander you really couldn't i mean it wasn't like that satan standing there was with dark and gloomy and you know big claws and no he's a beautiful angel listen he took two-thirds of the angels of heaven that god created and told him a lie and they believed it because he was so beautiful he must be true anyway and every spirit that confesses not that jesus has come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world that was a.d 96 year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he thus in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them like i said before how many conversations if you walk up to and that you used to be uh privy to and you could talk about the sports and the bretton and the gambling and what's on television what's on the news and what's on right now that should be all vague that should be nothing that concerns you that could be that should be something that you walk up and walk away from amen and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated in the lord at his blessing thank you for standing for a moment let's get through this real quick i don't want to get through too quick but i want these are just quotes that we quoted before till we get to genesis chapter 1 because remember genesis is the seed chapter of the bible everything began in genesis brother brown said the catholic church began in genesis christ antichrist if you've got antichrist that's where it started where did it start you know where the antichrist started at not on earth not in the garden of eden it started in heaven the antichrist came from christ that's the problem satan can't make his self christ but if you're born again today you are christ he can't stand that he hates that that he can't do what you do and he'll bore your brain won't he brother that he'll don't worry everything's gonna be all right ezekiel 28 verse 11 says moreover the word the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord you all have to bear with long arms back there he's the only one i think is working so be with him brother anderson we good thus saith the lord god thou seedlest up to some look full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou hast been in the garden the garden of god eden the garden of god two trees he was i mean he was as much welcome in the garden as anybody else was amen i mean right here he is he said he didn't now thou has been eaten the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis topaz diamond barrel onyx jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle and gold and brother joe sent me a thing and i didn't bring it i was going to bring it out here but that's only nine and there's 12 or there's you know there's 12 of different lights because it's the 12 tribes and there's three of them that satan can't be so i will maybe bring that later on but we didn't want to bring it tonight the sapphire the emerald carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared and then the day that thou was created god created lucifer god is the only creator no one else can create only god can create so he created a life and it was inhabited in a man named lucifer son of the morning beautiful worship angel god song leader why do you see all this now out in the world called fellowship centers and worship centers and and uh even heard this has been several years ago but when i was working at the poultry plant there was a brother come in and you know how brother brown said that the pentecostals used to just shout the whole service and then they shout so much the preacher didn't get to preach well this bat just it was the baptist and he said oh we had such an anointing this sunday and we sang for two and a half hours and said the preacher didn't even get to preach now folks you can't put you can't put singing over the word of god that means that have exalted satan above christ because christ is the word if you have no word there you can sit and sing all you want to all right but now look there's got to be a balance we know that brother brown give us the balance two or three songs and before service maybe a special then sing afterwards we know how that is and that's what we do but satan wants you to sing so much that you forget about the word of god that's his job and not not not rap music louise hip hop now he's closer than that he's closer than that that's what i want you to see he's so close he almost deceived me and you let's read demonology number one you know there's false there's a true and false of everything if i give you a dollar i say this is a good dollar and you look at it it'd have to look pretty much like a real dollar or you wouldn't believe it is that right so i have to be really a good imitation and if jesus said the two spirits in the last days would be so close until it would deceive the very elect if possible religious people now remember now there ain't nothing out there in them cold formal outside they have just a form of godliness you see but these two spirits are real spirits it'd be so close till it deceived the very leg how it was working side by side in the last days did jesus say that he did and then look by the opening of the seven seals brother adam saw how close it was when he saw that white horse rider come from where he was and then right off yeah praise god for riding off but i'd be scared to death to know he was right there at one time amen so there's your and then he's you know he after that he said you know everything comes into perspective the denial hawaii was so much against organized religion and why he was so much against that religious system why it was an antichrist system they hate to say that but it is that's what it is one and we can be the same thing right an exposition of the seven church ages this is one we are always going to read because i believe it is a mandate to this church right now not the church's past this church sitting here today breathing as hard as we can through these masks this is a mandate that me and you remember christ in the true church i'm going to decide that i'm going to be in the true church okay that's a decision that you have to make christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it right make it lukewarm formal and powerless see we lost our power by just what i was talking about we how can you use the power of the word of god when you got that one little thing right there you know in between one little thing brother brown said unconfessed sin one unconfessed sin can make the whole church fail why because god can't move he'll move to a certain spot and then he stops but he's waiting on us he's waiting on us to break that thing so maybe we can have a revival maybe we couldn't have one before maybe we can have one now i mean i'm saying we i'm saying me can have one because remember it's a personal revival because you sure do feel a lot better because satan's been for about two weeks he's been banging on his flesh not so much where you can see it but what's the worst sickness in the world right here that's where the greatest battle has ever fought not here this thing's just getting older and it's got aches and pains but when satan gets inside your brain and starts a merry-go-round that's the worst thing in the world you can have and i've never been depressed and you know i've never been depressed i've never had depression but i have never had anxiety either but now i can't say that i've had an ain't a couple of anxiety attacks and it ain't fun it's an attack i don't know why i'm on this but it's an attack and it attacks your mind it attacks and you know what the best thing you can do is is do what i said get all that out of the way but then you gotta read your bible you got to study you got to come to church why do you think god ain't moving in your life we look out here and you're not in church i'm just telling you what the bible says amen all right one unconfessed sin it exposes satan revealing his words see this is exposing satan you say oh bro wait you're just telling us about your life no this is exposing a demon and there's not just one of them many of us have been through this and may be going through it or maybe fixing to go through it but if you can't get anything from god first thing to do is start checking your life is everything okay is everything all right one unconfessed sin it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word now he's not going to tell you god's word's wrong he's going to discredit amen this antichrist spirit is so close till he quotes the word he quotes quotes he brings you the word [Music] letter but where's the power behind it he fights it he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is not a church out there not a church with a building a church what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework what is framework this building has a framework brother gary krantz put a lot of this framework up what it's inside the wall but it's inside this church that wall that framework is right here the framework is right here remember this is framed by the fall but that thing inside of you is not right now if you're not born again it's one and the same and you're lost but if you're born again you've got one spirit in here and you've got another spirit beating it out beating you out here amen that all right listen there's holy spirit none holy spirit a lot of things i do are unholy you saw no now we ain't talking about cussing drink we're just talking about doing little things little things little white foxes that spoil the vine but these two spirits if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church we're not fighting methodists and baptists and pentecostals and message churches and people that don't preach right and people that says we need to listen to we're not fighting them people we're fighting the spirit that motivates those people listen that's why i said before don't cry out against a person cry out against the spirit that's motivating that person that's my brother branham with that who was it the the preacher that just said off fully i'm going to drink beer and uh whoever he was you know brother brown didn't say well now bless god he's lost he's out of here no he told us what happened he even talked to the guy i believe but he said he died about six months later because he wouldn't now see would he have turned because remember i remember one time brother branham was talking about somebody that had left the fold you go oh but he said what'd he say but now i went and got him and he's safely back in the fold you see that's that's a backslider that's somebody that's done wrong and he went out there and said brother god bless you not cast the demons on top of him go out there with what brotherly kindness brotherly love that's what we're going to work on we got to work on that because it's right there at the top of that pyramid we need to work on that the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern now see there discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her forget about politics forget about the economy forget about all this stuff that's going on that's not the the antichrist you need to worry about someone you're going home with tonight and i ain't talking about your wife or your husband everybody go looking he has be he will be definitely thwarted today is when christ withstood now you see that prophet he put us in a position to where he satan came to jesus and jesus defeated him by what the word defeated by the word just quoted the word back to him just quoted and satan left him number three an exposition of the seven church ages he's reading in jude three beloveds when i give all diligence to write unto you the common salvation is needful for me to write unto you and exhort you you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men this is part of the scripture not saints but this is brother brown's quote crept in unawares these have not come into the foe by means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before of old ordained to this condemnation by foreknowledge ungodly men now not ungodly men man gonna walk into this place and be a pervert you understand what i'm saying that's why i keep going over and over this again we're waiting on some guy to walk in and try to pervert you no it's a spirit and he's slick and he sly and he slides in a snake slides slithers that's right he gets right up beside you ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ you know if you deny the word you deny god you deny the word you deny god these are feast spots in your feast of charity when they feast with you now i didn't make that a time i didn't make that bold letters that come out of the church age book with bold letters because they're feasting with us feeding themselves without fear now then again i don't want anybody to say oh brother wait he's talking about somebody in this building i'm not i'm talking about a spirit and it takes many forms it cannot be denied now this is the quote it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together where was it planted garden of eden there's with a division it wasn't planted on earth we ain't talking about no natural seed spiritual the problem is satan had to come and pervert what god created he couldn't create a perverted seed god said all souls are mine satan can't create one but he sure can pervert it amen he did that for me for 30 something years i'm pretty much whatever whatever you were too he perverted it for a good long period of time maybe some of you not but some of us were just a little bit harder headed and it took just a little bit longer but you know what we came at the time we're supposed to come all right so now we're going back to the back before the beginning as we were talking about before because we got to get back we got to get to earth to make this come to manifestation because there listen again there is not two seed lines natural right that's right right everybody got that same man there has never been two seed lines natural that god said i hate that one i love that one natural you hear what i said not there is no natural listen we're all born dead once the beast did what he did i say satan or lucifer vicariously threw the beast made him do that because he didn't do it he'd been living for years and years and years and never touched eve amen but when satan what perverted him into planting a natural seed he thought he could do something with that well he's not a creator that's what stumped the old devil when cain was born god had to give him a soul god had delivered he give cain a soul you think the devil did no the devil can't create god gave cain a soul now what perverted it cain perverted it or what cain did perverted it all right because what was the situation between cain and abel one was righteous one was not it was because of what they did not listen they both came out of the same womb eve both of them came out of the same womb one was a illegal act and one would have been a act whatever you want to say later on had adam and eve got together i don't believe sex was involved in the original except in the animal kingdom we weren't supposed to come by say sex is our problem all right so let's go number four questions and answers on genesis everybody all right i want us to cast light i want us to be illuminated by these by us have you ever done this before have you ever tried brother brandon was the greatest storyteller and i don't mean by telling stories lies i mean the greatest storyteller ever he can make you think you were standing in the garden of eden right beside adam and eve he'd make you think he was on the mountain with moses and he told it so slow till you didn't miss a detail thank god he was southern yeah he was a little bit northern we might have to rewind a few a few times but he spoke my language brother donnie i don't know about y'all but he told it slow but remember do you know why because he caught the mind of god he was a prophet i know that but you and i can catch the mind of god and you can just i can literally see someone standing in nothingness and saying let there be but i can also see a form standing there beside of him called lucifer because he created him first because he's his right hand man right so there's lucifer for the whole time the whole time god created heaven and earth stars everything he was there he didn't create him later on down the line he created him as right hand man because satan was going to help him not help him create but he said i made you perfect i anointed you i made you beautiful something to admire that's why john admired that church in the book of revelations brother brown said the angel had to turn him away from that beautiful church that was the all right questions and answers on genesis the first creation was god himself the now of god came to logos which was the son of god then out of the logos which was the word beginning was the word word was with god and where was with god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth the man who's he talking about to genesis 1 26 ma'am everybody okay with that all right because the genesis 1 26 man is just an extension of god it's not a different person it's not another creation it's not something separate from god it's that light that we're talking about that doesn't it's not created or destroyed it can only be changed from one form to the other so god changed his form just like jesus christ is almighty god god just changed his form he didn't change his person he didn't change his personality listen if jesus would have come just a regular normal person he'd have been just like me and you he'd have fought this word because in your humanity and in your fallen condition we fight this word you say no i don't yeah you do every time you did what you did you fight the word of god i'm talking about when you were not born again all right so the first creation was god himself and now the god out of god came to logos what was it not another god it was just god stepped over now remember as we said before and i'll read it here in just a little while light travels at 186 000 miles per second do you know that the sun goes down eight minutes before we see it go down it rises six minutes because it takes six minutes to go 93 million miles like traveling at 186 000 miles per second now second i'm talking about but it takes six minutes that's how far that sun is from the earth it takes six minutes for that light to get here because light travels listen light's just not here light travels light is light has a origin and it travels oh you ought to see something you ought to see something with that light originates from somewhere and it travels and it gives off photons and neutrons and lord it's all kind of things and things banging into each other and and all that if you want to study it but i don't have time we just need to stay in the spiritual aspect because remember there was an s-o-n before there was an s-u-n amen there was an s-o-n before there was an s-u-n because it gave light first the s-u-n gave light later all right here we go so ezekiel 28 verse 11 says son of man take up a lamentation and the king of tires we already read this before and he's beautiful well thou was created thou art the anointed let's go down to verse 14. thou art the anointed cherub now who anointed him god anointed him the original anointing that lucifer received was from god because he can't create so we so he had to get this anointing from god but once he got this anointing can you imagine being god you say no but could you imagine though that anything you think of anything brother brown said if god said let there be fleas he said within five seconds they would be 30 miles all around this world and he'd destroy this world with fleas in five seconds but it's all under control right he said what he's saying brother wayne he he god has limitless power but he's decided see god made a choice to limit himself he's a father and he's all these different things but he had to limit himself just like you know what why i'm not gonna scare you but why oh that's why does that not keep going that's light why didn't that just keep going there was no power behind it but take somebody like god almighty you can't turn him off and on he stays on all the time amen and he just keeps going do you know i was reading just a few minutes ago that it takes 40 000 years 40 000 years man has somehow figured this out it takes 40 000 years to whatever we see in the sun whatever emanates from the inside of that core of that sun photons and molecules and all these different things it takes 40 000 years for it to get to the surface to light the sun 40 000 years you think god's got patience he created that thing a long time ago and it's been given sunlight for at least 6 000 years it's never not come up amen and that's a created thing but let's see where it came from here if we ever get to it brother louise we'll get to it verse number five look at number five now wait a minute that was perfect in our ways from the day that was created till iniquity was found in thee what is iniquity doing something knowing you shouldn't or go and do something that you know you shouldn't do and you do it anyway that is a hideous sin to god that's iniquity all right that's why the mystery of iniquity under the first seal was is that that thing stayed right here if you didn't get the baptism of the holy ghost to get that thing to ride off from you all right thou art the anointed cherub that coveth i have set thee so god said him right there now satan wasn't as what i said before god's got this unlimited power why didn't he just look over and go i think i'll make another one and no he wanted to use that one because when god does something he does it perfect right you say satan was perfect i just read to you the bible says it was perfect somewhere in here one of them that says thou were perfect it's in there somewhere it's maybe it's in that other one right here when thou was created there are the anointed cherub that covereth i have set thee so that was upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou what there it is thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created until iniquity was found in thee that's right oh my number five did you know that in heaven that the devil was god's right-hand man in the beginning that lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that god had created lucifer is sitting there and he's going wait a minute i can't use the stars i can't use the moon i can't use the trees i can't use the grass i can't touch that tree of life but i got a little knowledge because i see the animals procreating by what god told them every seed would bring forth of its kind everybody got that say amen that's what satan entered in right there he said huh i think i can get to the human race that way and that's exactly what it did listen we're not dealing with a second class we're not dealing with a with a second grader we're dealing with somebody that has perfected his skill over thousands and maybe even hundreds of thousands of years i don't think we can defeat him but god can all right let's go back um and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that god had created what the animals or the beasts and pervert it back into an evil thing which started all this trouble in the beginning then god before the foundation of the world was ever laid when he seen what satan done for knowledge he was co-worker partly equal with him only satan could not create god is the only creator but satan took something that god created and perverted it back into something else evil let's go to revelation 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven mike and his angels fought against the dragon now who is michael michael is christ it's just god in another form like i said before he runs faster than the 186 thousand miles per second god you know why because he created that anything that created that's got to be faster than that oh what a mighty god we serve when he can be standing in one place right here tonight speaking to you and he can be in the jungles of africa visiting them with the baptism of the holy ghost the same god he didn't send another god over there it's the same god but he's traveled over there so fast that's why i believe that god let brother branham see these dimensions and see how fast they're they're just faster things listen when god came into this dimension he had to slow down after the fall he had to slow down because we're at a crawl and he's just like travel the universe even brother brown remember he told us he said you've got the creative power to you what go create a world they didn't say you needed a jet or a or a rocket to get there he said create a world and go live on it what boom boom right here because that's what's going to change us we don't realize what we already got not what's coming it's what we've already got we've just it's so we got so much fog around it it's a foggy place but let there be light all right you okay the right-hand man where we at revelation there was war in heaven michael and his angel fought against the dragon now kids and adults they were not up there like i said before they weren't having a wwe world wrestling federation or um mma knocked down dragout no it was the word satan preached his word michael preached his it was the spirits this fight today we're not fighting each other you're fighting a spirit you can be fighting a spirit and you don't even know it i quote you brother brown said told that brother he said you fought your way here to this meeting the brother said i just got in the car and come to work come to the meeting why brother brown saw in that other dimension the fight that was going on the spiritual battle that was going on for that guy to get here listen this whole listen don't you think for one second for one second that satan's not after you he has sent a demon to personally be with you just like god sent an angel for you to be and you know what they're doing they're fighting what by words my words is what condemned me not my physically beating the person up or getting beat up sometimes that's too easy but you see those scars because you see it outside but what about those insiders you can't see amen we got to get rid of those things folks it'll kill us and prevail not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning now what is the morning dark no the morning sunlight how are thou cut down to the ground which didest weaken the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will descend into heaven i will exalt my throne now listen there's we got to the difference like we were talking about with nathan and cora and and jethro because god told us we could sit on his throne see the difference god told us we could god told us we were gods god told us we were little creators god told us we were little messiahs but satan says i'm going to exalt myself for thou hast said in thy heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation hmm could be right here this is the congregation we're gathered together today right okay now watch and there was a question one time and i've answered it before let's answer it again that day at calvary 1960 brother bryan says sin did not start on the earth sin started in heaven lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven where god put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he puts human beings on now listen they can't be saved because what about lucifer's angels no they're condemned but who's going to judge them you and i are going to judge them we're going to judge eve i took that scripture out for to save time but the bible tells us we will even judge angels where god put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings knowledge the tree of knowledge tree of life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and when lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice he wanted something better than god had that started the trouble number seven greatest battle ever fought this great first battle was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings all right now these these angels did not become human beings they can't do that brother branham tells you that many many many many times and i agree 100 no but you let it anoint you why because it comes from the great anointed cherub he's anointed his imps and his disciples and they go out and anoint you you see what see god can get down in your soul and change you satan came right it can pervert what god's already got right make you do things you don't even want to do amen then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan came to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth began in us in us and has been raging every sense amen second corinthians verse 11 of chapter 11 verse 13 for such a false apostle deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light but now remember we got to put a few scriptures together because jesus told the disciples he said if that light in you be darkness how great is that darkness in other words if you think you're right and you think your light is right and it's not how great is that darkness why because you're so dark you think you're standing in the light but it's the darkest time you've ever been in him is that all right for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore there's no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works now we've seen many times before we still see it now how that satan is trying to destroy the ministry look at all the if you've got your bibles you can turn to genesis 1 or we'll read it here we're finally getting there louise genesis 1 verse 1 and we'll start there and try to break this down if you don't mind i want you to just be bear with me i've been thinking about this and and when we look at things that doesn't have we don't have quotes for yeah we might be presuming but when we can take the bible and the quotes and then we let the holy ghost put it together for us and you eliminate things that it can't be like brother dale said that you know you go and it's true if you'd go through the process of elimination do that if you're sitting there sick today if you're sitting here and there's some problem going on in your life go through the process of elimination do i pray do i read my bible do i go to church every time the doors are open people just people lather around in their sin and they go well i don't know what's wrong with me i don't know what's wrong with me ain't been in church in three weeks haven't read your bible in a month but i believe the message but i believe the message that's the that's the most damning quote but i believe the message i can go do what i want to do but i believe the message yeah you believe the message all right it's that one that lucifer told them to say them demons up there and then 200 000 000 of them got loosed you know what brother brown said loose on who us the bride all right let's be careful so let's go to genesis 1. let's start right here in the beginning now he's god because he so now he's already created something to worship and there is no there is no account in genesis 1 to tell you when satan or sorry when lucifer could you have to call him lucifer first i created thee oh lucifer he didn't call him satan or the devil then he's lucifer see god give him a chance even lucifer is called what light or light bearer lucifer is not this dark thing like you think he is he's not some demon that you can't look at no he's beautiful but what has man done what has satan done through man depicted him in movies and cartoons and you boogie man i think the devil that's just one of his demons but it ain't the devil that thing that brother branham was allowed to show billy paul that looked like the uh alley oops that was just that wasn't satan that was one of his amps right it wasn't that wasn't satan satan's a beautiful man that's why we're gonna look at him and go where'd all that horror came from come from you're beautiful it's close but once we see there's a quote once we see the two spirits working in the framework of the church and can what withstand it and discern it with discern it and then withstand it so you got to discern it in your heart and withstand it and the only way you can do it is by what by the word of god all right so let's go in the beginning god so god now i believe he's got angels already created and i believe he's already got lucifer because you wouldn't be god because god is a what objects of worship but remember brother branham tells us and so does scofield that that is elohim the self-existing god even though he has created angels something to worship him but they're not human beings they can never be a son and daughter of god they can never make him father they can make him god oh that ought to get you right here how that god has preserved one spot for me and you that nobody can touch satan i don't think satan understood that part when the genesis 1 26 man came out and not just came out or like brother dale something vomiting up no he just moved over to another farm right listen that genesis 1 26 and 27 man what's the creator or he's another person oh didn't brother brown say you're a little creator didn't he walk out there one day and said let there be a squirrel something satan can't do he can pervert the squirrel but he can't make one pop out on that limb like brother brown did and he said visions don't bleed what i love that vicious don't bleed he says i shot that squirrel and it bled so that was a creative act of god listen satan was as mad as a hornet that day he said i've been trying to do that for 65 000 years and you got this little man down here and he's out here creating squirrels everywhere you know what you know what the lord said he said that's my son and you're not that came from me it was a part of me it always was me and i created you because you got a beginning oh i know that william brown he was born april 9 19 what oh see oh night where god said hang on man that's because remember back in the garden that's what you did you you you you are the one that had him come that way through the set perversion you had him come but what's inside of him that's doing the creating now you can't touch it you don't even understand it right right you don't even know where that came from and that made satan so mad he couldn't stand it same way within the beginning god created heaven and the earth and satan's going let me and god's going nope say let me nope i think it ought to see that's where you get into the trouble because satan was standing there going no i think that milky way needs to be over younger no if god said it's right there he should have known better see that's why what iniquity was found in his heart he should have known better and kept his mouth shut but he couldn't that's the same way with us we get a lot of trouble when we what and the earth was without form now remember he created the heaven and earth i want you to look at something here real quick am i okay i want you to project yourself back into that space of time not well it's actually an eternity and you're almighty god can you do that yeah you can if you got him inside of you you can ask him because you know what happened i believe moses sat down one day and said god i want to know what went on in the garden he said okay god said okay moses i'll i'll tell you what happened in the garden and i'll let you write about your death if you want to while we're at it we'll just write the whole five first five books of the bible we'll tell you before the flood after the flood and even after you get gone amen so why can't he let us just kind of stand in not stand in this place but stand there and let that oneness inside of you project that image that hey that's the only way it could be because god created the heaven and earth now brother brown said that period there could have been millions of years he said nothing else could have happened right so you got to go back to the prophet nothing happened for billions of years maybe we'll read a quote just a minute maybe where he said an atom broke off of the sun and world for millions of years and then god said stop everybody okay and the earth was without form and void now remember we can't tell exactly when satan and lucifer i mean when lucifer and michael fought but i would say it was before the foundation of the world because if sin started in heaven so god created heaven and earth brother louise when he created heaven and earth satan's going hmm place to play i can't create but as soon as he creates it i can step into it oh my you got to think like satan now but that's the way i was thinking the other day i thought man god said heaven and earth the devil looks down and goes hmm i think that's where i'm gonna start my business right there i can't go back to heaven no more i can't go back to where i was at so here's something right here that i can start with so it was that form and void because you know what that's the same thing he did with you as brother luis was talking about your earth was without form and void why satan was in it the devil was in your world that's why it's without form and void god can't create something evil like that but satan can pervert it and the earth was without form and void because remember now the battle is fixing to start on earth are they okay with that and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness whose darkness satan you can't come over here with this light set not anymore me and you can fellowship we can talk to each other but i'm fixing to divide this thing up is that all right because i'm going to tell you watch you know what the definition of light is put that up brother anderson now this is before the sun and the moon now you there's a lot of quotes but i want to show just watch this something that makes vision possible you cannot see without light impossible to see without just a little form of light because the light receptors hits your eyes and then they bounce back out and everybody got that try to look in the dark you can't look in a dark place something that makes vision possible let there be now remember light can't be created or diminished it's always there um all right the sensation aroused by stimulation of the visual receptors because watch what god said don't take it back to it i'm gonna read it right here and god said let there be light and god saw the light that it was good and god what saw the light he stepped over in another form right yeah and i'll tell you what that form is all that brother i'm telling you but watch this electromagnetic magnetic radiation of any wavelength that travels in a vacuum with a speed of 299 792 458 meters which is 186 000 miles per second specifically such radiation that is visible to the human eye because remember there's ultraviolet lights and there's all we're not going to get into that keep going on down further dawn a source of light a celestial body is night falls electric light color of notable lightness keep going up we got all this we know what some of that is watch this spiritual illumination the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it john 1 5. brother dale read it last week inner light enlightenment reaching out and groping for a pathway to the light satan looks over and he goes where'd that come from sorry lucifer looks over and says where'd that come from god said you don't know anything about this you don't know anything about this light you can't touch this light now satan is going to go well i think i'll go create my own see remember he's son of the morning he's got all that he's a bright light but remember his light is not created it's artificial his light is this right here that's his light god's light doesn't have an own switch and an off switch but to get to where you and i can see the revelation to where you and i can read genesis 1 and understand what god's doing moving through an eternity an eternal god that had no beginning that has no end he's getting ready to bring something to being spiritual illumination that light shines in the darkness enlightenment revelation revelation god is getting ready he said well what about the heaven on earth he's already created that he's letting that sit there for a little while we know he's the creator god because he said god created go back to genesis 1 please thank you and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness he said all right devil what i'm fixing to do from now on you stay over here now of course satan's already going now i'm going i'm going to the earth as soon as he gets it all good and finished remember he's standing right there now watch let's continue to read the account and then let's go back god said let there be light and there was light and what is light it's something that makes vision possible you and i would never know what went on in this account of genesis had that light not shown up first because the sun is our natural light it's right out here it's what we sustains our natural life but don't you think brother louise i've read many commentaries of of uh jewish scholars i read three of them the other night and and i agree with one of them two of them i don't have a clue what they were talking about but but one of them was a little bit plain and he said you know what he said there stands god or jehovah yahweh whatever they call him you know because he was jewish and he said all of a sudden he said this great big ball comes behind him not the sun but the sun's a part of it because you i'll i'm going to read to you what brother brown talks about clinkers put in clinkers he says it six times put in clinkers he'll tell you what happened he said something came off of something it's way same brother wait i believe that when he said let there be light that the whole universe just lit up because the commentator said he said you can't have creation without movement think about it you can't have creation without movement even though god created the fish remember once that fish came on earth there had to be a firing mechanism that fired that thing why do you why are you at 98.6 degrees today and where does that come from your body is 98.6 degrees and it holds that way unless you're sick right why does it hold that way things are firing off inside of you so now take that as a creator and let that thing fire out billions because he's fixing to create billions of stars billions listen our son just lights our solar system it doesn't light all that stuff they find out there millions and millions and millions and millions of light years from here the sun is for us the s-o-n is for us this is where we're going to live and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day in the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning was the first day now watch before the sun now remember you got to have sun just a few minutes here you got to have sunlight for photosynthesis and what is it warmth to do what fire your cells c-e-l-l-s fire your cells everybody understand that what photosynthesis is a plant starts it has to get warm from what sunlight pops open and then it comes out and then it has the green shoots and it goes through photosynthesis it brings life and it grows now look and even in the morning with the first day and god said let there be a firmament and mister the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament now what's the firmament atmosphere everybody got that saying man atmosphere you know why he made an atmosphere because he's fixing to put living people on there and animals first and god made the firmament divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so remember there was no rain until noah's time the ground watered in the mid mist and brother brown said the wells would come up out of the ground it would water my what an irrigation system didn't have to worry about rain brother donnie it was just all coming up from out of the ground and you just play it you know your plants just grew god called the firmament heaven in the evening in the morning with the second day and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so god called the dry land earth and the gathering together the water he called the seas and god saw that it was good and god said let the earth bring forth grass now look it's bringing forth something before the s-u-n is as completely made that we need so there's so much energy i'm just i know i'm not getting it to you there's so much energy in this creation so the whole place just talk about a big bang theory they ain't got a clue dan got a clue i believe it was a big bang but i don't believe it was nothing that man can control it only took god to stop it when it needs to stop and to keep it going when it needs to keep going so who is the light john 1 says he was that light john wasn't that light but he was that light and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit trees yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it will sow and the earth brought forth grass so there was light there was some kind of s-u-n light before he made the ball anybody got that so why didn't he listen why didn't he just while he was standing there all of a sudden behind him comes this thing just huge ball of energy which is all god brother brown said all the stars he said that's god writing his bible in the stars amen we'll read that in a minute so we know basically that on the fourth day he created the s-u-n or he brought the s-u-n into being everybody got sentenced because they said let there be lights in the firm of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and seasons and days and years and let them be for lights in the firm of the heaven to give light upon what the earth now when he said let there be light he didn't say just let there be light on earth let there be light and then big photons just went off and i believe it just exploded but watch what brother brown says let's read this real quick and then we'll close number eight is the rising of the sun now the sun at the rising of the sun now there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness it was without form and void it was all covered with water and laying there dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon the water and said let there be light god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live but now watch he's not talking about the sun right here not the s-u-n he said and the first light was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word when he said all right this is going to wake you up let there be light buddy let me tell you something there was a chain reaction that went off that you there's no way you could see it with your natural human eye only god could look at it and say that was good you know why because everything i'm fixing to make is in that little ball or that huge ball right there i'm going to make clinkers and i'm going to have a prophet talk about clinkers we'll talk about it right here but now watch the first light ever given on earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word and he said let there be light remember it was the logos which the logo says the light you know what he said amen let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth revelations 21 verse 22 this is where i went to right here watch and i saw no temple now this is at the end this is when we're going into the eternal future home amen and we're going to have plants and animals and we're going to have people but there's something we don't have to have like we didn't have to have it to begin with had there not been a fall and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon for the glory of god everything's going back to genesis oh that future home is gonna water it's gonna be lit up right here but let there be that was millions of years ago he said let there be light and there has not been darkness in him at all and even when we get to the future home brother john you ain't got to turn a switch when you go in your house you are the light the lamb is the light and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it into what the light all right all right we got another one two or three witnesses let's go to isaiah isaiah 60 the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord the creator and now his bride in a multiple form that wasn't there but she was in him if you tonight don't think that you were there you weren't but you should be able to say oh god when you said let there be light i jumped up and said amen where did the son i know we weren't people but the joy of the father is what's inside of him you can't find me in him back before i was born because you didn't know that's natural but a spiritual god that knows every person every every son and daughter of god by name amen he knows exactly you know where they were and what was the first light on the earth the spoken word of god how did you get here you got here by the spoken word of god if you god didn't speak to your heart you wouldn't be sitting here tonight amen so let there be light and you go yeah it's good where were you job when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy why they were inside of the creator i couldn't have done this a week ago the sun shall no more light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give any light but the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light when we walk into that city we're the light glory when we walk outside of that city we're the light then jesus tells us that you are the light of the world why hide it under a bushel i'm sorry i feel good this is a creation why did brother brown tell us we're a continuation of that creation because of the fall there had to be at the beginning of the creation of god like brother dale's talking about that's right but before that you were never created you always were that soul inside of you has a fire that can light a whole planet and make it and go live on it now who showed william man brandon that god showed it to him he showed him what he had he said tell my people what they got right right brother brad didn't come to change the bible he come to tell us what's already been said amen are we living it well i didn't get many amens out of that one but the sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light in the days of thy morning that's not a.m that's the days of you mourning and crying will be over but you know what we get a little taste of that here because we're going to be changed our future home will be right here and we're going to just step over into another dimension let man let loose what artificial like atomic bombs but can you see there god stood and said let there be light and it's never changed since right and if there hadn't been a fall we wouldn't have needed the sun or moon because you know what after the fall is over that proves we don't need it because you're the light but see you're heading now see every you see the pictures of jesus with mary holding jesus and there's this little halo around his head a little halo around here no i thought it was a secret you and i are a secret light to this world that's right they look at you and go well you're just a 20-something-year-old kid you have oh you're just as worldly as the rest of them then you go no no there's there's something there's something got turned on that something got placed in my heart and i can trace it back to where god stood in eternity and said let there be light and i my illumination comes from the word of god your illumination should come from the word of god sorry it takes long but i'm going to read this one last quote because brother brown watch there's six quotes but i brought just one when i get finished with this quote musicians come and now the bible teaches us that the logos went out from god or i might say all of the god becoming his first body form when the logos went out of god now it's 1953. let's look what it looked like no one has seen the father at any time nowhere never did never will right but what is the logos that's the light but then the logos that went out of him became like a little halo of light let's see it playing you under like a child before the doorstep of the fight you know what he's saying when he says that here's daddy sitting in the living room and we're looking down at our kid playing with um legos or lincoln logs that's what he's talking about a child playing right because what's he fixing to do he's fixing to say let there be let there be milky way go over here oh so much power but where's that power tonight it's in you you brought it with you yeah if you didn't bring it with you it's here for you to get right and now i can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his memory or his mind what about you have an unlimited memory you go all right i'm going to make a milky way it's going to have 874 million stars and i'm going to put it right over there try that sometime we can't hardly get our furniture rearranged in our house and now i can see him as he moves over here and he draws in his memory or his mind a picture of what the world would should be now there's not a star or nothing i hear him say let there be hold on now and then adam broke under what is the light that's when atoms and photons beat each other they hit on each other and it creates a spark and when it did the sun came into this but now watch you say oh no now you've done you know that look watch what he's saying and when it did the sun came into existence great big ball not the sun like we got but that sun is inside of that because watch what he's saying the sun came into existence and began to whirl she burned for millions of years and millions and millions of years after a while i see a clinker fly off of it off of it not coming from somewhere else a clinker went off of this great big let there be light ball everybody got that not the sun that we have it was created on the fourth day you cannot go against the bible but like i said when he said let there be light why didn't this great i can just see this great big energy come out into the universe but inside of it was the stars inside of it was the sun that we live by because we're not the only we are the only pebbles on the beach but we're not the only sun our solar system all right after a while i see a clinker fly off of it brother brown makes a noise what is it the first star that flew from the sun so if you kept the sun at this at our we say little a little bit then it's it must be getting smaller because there's a clinker going off of it he watches it fall for a few million years and he stops it then another one flies off and he lets it fall a few million years and stops it what's he doing he's writing his first bible from not the sun that we get up on in the morning from that sun that he created that big boom here's this great big ball of energy and you know who's standing in the middle of it the creator the logos is standing right in the middle of it to me i can see it just as plain as today he's standing there just like this and there's great big things behind him and the devil's going what are you fixing to do and he's going flicks his finger and there goes a star yeah he waits a little while longer and he flicks his finger and that ball gets a little bit smaller because to me i think that's as much god out there as it is here as far as his creation you and i we know i know listen he's he's what we care about but why did he put it all up there first that's my whole point musicians come my whole point is why did god put the first bible in the stars if that wasn't important because that was the first bible that was the first way man navigated that was the first way he knew about god was from the stars that came off of that big ball and when god got finished i believe he everything clinked off that sun and it became the size that we needed because then brother branham another quote he said all right he said now the earth is too far he said i'm just going to bring it back 93 million miles away that way we can have summer winter and fall it'll be my word it'll be my word made manifest and this earth is where we're going to live i'm going to put my children on it and i'm going to take care of it and i'm going to put a garden in there and i know what you're going to do lucifer but don't worry job said i know my redeemer living i believe he got a revelation that he looked back in time because he said job where were you when the sons of god shout i believe he projected job back job had a revelation he had a light experience a revelation that something happened and now job's here in this bad situation but then he looks back and he sees him again and he said oh that man's coming to get me folks that's not a hope that's a promise of almighty god he's coming back to get us he will not let our let that creation just be nothing let's stand our feet god bless you i love that definition something that makes vision possible the sensual sensation aroused by stimulation of the visual receptors who in here likes darkness we all like light when that light comes on in the morning even if it may be just the light in your house you feel more comfortable than you do in the darkness it's what much more in the spiritual light when we get up out of the bed and we start our day we'll walk in the light such a beautiful light come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night jesus the light of the world all ye saints of [Music] [Applause] [Music] in his name jesus the light of the world [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] shine [Music] i know some of us that deer hunting different things have you ever been in a place to where you you just couldn't get warm why because there was no sunlight i've had my feet beast of froze you couldn't feel them brother gary but i'd find some light coming through the woods and i'd stick my toe how many of you done that brother danny's done it you'll find that sunlight and i'll guarantee in just a few minutes you'll feel that what warm light listen that's an energy think about this that's an energy that took 40 000 years to get to the top of the sun and then go 93 million miles what god's done for us people just in the natural [Music] i need some sunlight on my shoes god okay it's been produced several thousand years ago it'll be there in just a few minutes same way with the spiritual he's not going to leave you cold and formal but you got to get to where the light is you can't walk in darkness light is a form of energy energy can neither be created nor destroyed it can only be changed from one form to another god decided to change his form to a bride and the coldest this world's ever been there's always been a bride but when we leave this place brother bob the light will be gone there'll be no more light until we come back in the millennium but not really until we come back in the future home because john saw that big bright ball come down out of heaven and brother brown says there'll be no night there'll be no day inside that city why you don't need the sunshine anymore you need to let there be [Music] just as brother dale was telling y'all the other night god was pleased to dwell in jesus christ when you got born again you had a river jordan experience god came down with that heavenly light and said i am pleased to reside right here if you have not had that experience tonight do not fall asleep because it may be your last time please get that warmth in here i'd rather have it in here i can put on enough clothes and i turn on a heater but when the coldness of hell comes on top of you you need a light from somewhere else you don't need a light bulb they've done made light now where led light don't even give off any don't give off any heat artificial satan has artificial light but god never has artificial light never had it never will have it and ye are the light oh jesus sing out course one more time when you're dismissed oh well walking in the line go with god you're dismissed for life come when i do of mercy our bride o shine all around us by day and by night the light of the world come confess him as your king jesus [Music]
