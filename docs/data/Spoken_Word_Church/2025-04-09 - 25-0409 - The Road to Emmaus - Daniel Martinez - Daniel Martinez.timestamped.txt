[5:23] name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I want to
[5:27] send greetings from New Mexico. Uh uh I
[5:31] uh uh brother Emanuel uh asked me to
[5:34] minister this last Sunday over there and
[5:37] I says I can't. I'm I'm on my way to to
[5:40] Georgia. I said, "But uh but
[5:43] nevertheless," I said, "But you'll be
[5:44] praying for me because they asked me to
[5:46] minister." So, he said, "I will. I will.
[5:48] I'll be praying for you and we'll we'll
[5:51] handle it." Cuz he was going to be going
[5:52] to Arizona to another service. So, uh uh
[5:57] I think he's going to be coming here,
[5:58] brother,
[6:02] uh Brother Chris. Yeah, he's went to go
[6:04] for minister for brother Chris. And uh
[6:08] so, uh let's go to the word now. Let's
[6:11] turn in uh St. Luke the 24th
[6:16] verse 24th chapter the 13th verse and
[6:19] this is the road to Emmas. Everybody
[6:22] kind of remembers that uh that that
[6:25] portion of scripture and uh I want to
[6:28] talk a little bit about uh about this
[6:30] this portion of scripture. Amen. Amen.
[6:36] Uh, and behold, two men went that same
[6:40] day unto a village called Emmas, which
[6:43] was from
[6:45] Jerusalem three score furlongs. And I
[6:48] think I looked that up on Google and it
[6:50] said about 7 milesi, but brother Brown
[6:52] did say it was about six miles. And and
[6:55] they talked together. They talked
[6:57] together for
[7:00] all talked together of all these things
[7:04] which had happened. And it came to pass
[7:07] that while they communed together, the
[7:12] communed together and
[7:15] reasoned. Jesus himself drew near and
[7:18] went with them. But their eyes were
[7:21] hidden holden that they should not know
[7:24] him. And he said and he said unto them,
[7:28] "What manner of communications are these
[7:31] that ye have one with another and and as
[7:36] ye walk and are sad?" And one and the
[7:40] and the one them whose name was
[7:45] Cleopus answered and said unto him, "Art
[7:49] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
[7:52] and hast not known the things which were
[7:56] which are come to pass in in pass there
[8:01] in these days?" And he said unto them,
[8:05] "What things?" And they said, And they
[8:08] said unto him, Concerning Jesus of
[8:12] Nazareth, which was a prophet, mighty
[8:16] indeed, mighty indeed, and word and word
[8:21] before God, and all and all the people,
[8:24] and the and now and how the chief
[8:28] priests and our rulers delivered him up
[8:32] to
[8:34] to be condemned to death and have
[8:37] crucified him. But we trusted that he
[8:41] that he which should have he he that he
[8:46] which should have redeemed Israel. And
[8:49] besides this all two besides this two
[8:56] days besides this today is the third day
[9:01] since these things were done. Yay. And
[9:05] certain women also of our company made
[9:10] astonish made us astonished which were
[9:13] early at the sephiler. And when they
[9:17] found not his body, they came saying
[9:20] that they had also seen visions of
[9:24] angels which said that he was alive. And
[9:28] and certain of them which were with us
[9:33] went unto the sephiler, and found it
[9:36] even as the woman had said, but but him
[9:41] they saw not. And he said unto them, "Oh
[9:45] fools, slow of heart to believe all that
[9:49] the prophets have spoken. Ought not
[9:52] Christ to have suffered these things and
[9:55] to to enter in into his glory? And
[9:58] beginning with Moses and all the
[10:01] prophets, he expounded unto them in the
[10:05] in the scriptures the things concerning
[10:08] himself. And they drew nigh unto the
[10:11] village where wherein they went. And he
[10:14] made as if though he would have gone
[10:17] further. But they con uh constrained
[10:20] him, saying, "Abide with us, for it is
[10:23] now towards evening, and the day is far
[10:26] spent."
[10:27] And and he went in and carried with
[10:32] them. And it came to pass as he sat at
[10:37] meat with them, he took bread and
[10:40] blessed it and broke it and gave it to
[10:42] them and amen and their eyes were opened
[10:46] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[10:49] their sight and they said one to
[10:53] another, "Did not our hearts burn within
[10:55] us while he talked with us by the way
[11:00] while he opened unto us the scriptures.
[11:03] And they rose up that same hour and
[11:05] returned to Jerusalem and found the 11
[11:10] gathered together and then and that they
[11:13] were uh
[11:15] together. And then when they had when
[11:19] they were with them, saying, "The Lord
[11:24] is risen indeed and has appeared to
[11:26] Simon." And they and they told what
[11:31] things were done and the way how how he
[11:36] was known unto them in the breaking of
[11:38] the bread. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[11:41] once again. Our dear Lord Jesus, we're
[11:43] so grateful Lord God for your word. And
[11:46] Lord Jesus, we pray oh Lord God, you
[11:48] just bless each and every one of us as
[11:49] we come to hear from you. You can be
[11:52] seated. Amen. Amen. So now talking about
[11:55] Emmas here, uh you know the Bible does
[11:59] speak about Cleopus, but who was the
[12:01] other guy?
[12:03] And uh if you pay attention a little
[12:06] bit, you you might notice this other
[12:08] person, he has appeared to Simon. Well,
[12:10] he hadn't appeared to Simon Peter yet.
[12:12] So it wasn't that Simon. So you you
[12:16] might say that the second person that
[12:17] was on his way to Emmas might have been
[12:20] a guy named Simon. and he appeared to he
[12:23] says maybe one of them was testifying
[12:25] says he appeared to him you know
[12:27] appeared to Simon there are the two that
[12:30] came from Emmas but then you start
[12:32] noticing there's other scriptures that
[12:34] are in there that kind of seem uh uh
[12:36] strange the guy named Cleopius where do
[12:39] you see the name Cleopius in the Bible
[12:41] in other places
[12:44] uh you know the Catholics have a saying
[12:47] that because they they they they
[12:49] emphasize a lot on the cross and the
[12:51] death of Jesus on the cross and all this
[12:54] and they tell you, "Oh, the three Marys
[12:56] were standing right there by the cross."
[12:59] So, you read about the three Marys. I'm
[13:01] going to go over there real quick of the
[13:03] three Marys. Let's go on to uh uh John
[13:08] St. John
[13:09] 19 and it the 25th verse it says, "Now
[13:13] there stood by the cross of Jesus his
[13:17] mother." Of course, she her name was
[13:19] Mary.
[13:21] Okay. His mother and his
[13:24] mother's sister, Mary, the wife of
[13:29] Cleopus and Mary Magdalene, the three
[13:33] Marys. So Mary had a sister who was
[13:37] married to a guy named Cleopus. Is this
[13:40] the same guy? Well, interestingly
[13:42] enough, they put an H in this one and
[13:44] they didn't have an H in the other one.
[13:46] So, a little bit different. But
[13:48] nevertheless, start looking at this at
[13:50] the at the scripture closely and you
[13:52] start to notice there's other references
[13:56] like uh like where where you see
[14:00] uh on verse 19
[14:04] uh let me see on verse
[14:07] 19 they said he was a prophet mighty in
[14:12] deed and in word. So they recognize
[14:15] Jesus as a prophet.
[14:18] Well, Jesus was to come as the as the
[14:21] son of man, which means prophet. Amen.
[14:24] But yet he was a prophet and he came in
[14:28] that ministry. He called himself the son
[14:30] of man just like Ezekiel was called the
[14:32] son of man all through the scriptures.
[14:34] But you start to notice that they come
[14:36] up with another reference when they say
[14:40] where they say uh he was a prophet.
[14:43] Okay. mighty indeed. But then you find
[14:45] out that they also and that they also
[14:48] called him on verse 20 verse 21 they
[14:52] said but we
[14:53] trusted on verse 21 it says but we
[14:57] trusted that he had
[15:01] been been the one that should redeem
[15:05] Israel.
[15:07] So the only one that could redeem Israel
[15:09] was the Messiah. Amen. So they trusted
[15:11] that he was the Messiah. really is what
[15:14] they're saying. And you start to see
[15:15] that even though Jesus did come as in
[15:18] the ministry of a prophet, he also came
[15:22] as the Messiah. And he came as the son
[15:26] of God, the son of man, the son of
[15:28] David. They he he responded to the name
[15:31] the son of David to uh to blind
[15:34] Bartameus. So you can start seeing that
[15:36] that and and many of the Jews called him
[15:38] son of David. He responded to them. But
[15:41] if that Sarapheneia woman called him the
[15:44] same name and he didn't respond to her
[15:45] at all, but she responded to her when
[15:48] she said, "Lord, my Lord." See, so
[15:51] there's a difference there. You you'll
[15:52] notice in the scripture, things seem to
[15:56] be uh if you look at the scriptures,
[15:59] you'll start to see that things tie in
[16:02] perfectly everywhere.
[16:05] Everywhere. If you'll notice. So what
[16:07] happens then as we look at the
[16:09] scriptures and we look at the what was
[16:10] going on on the road to Emmas there we
[16:13] start to see that there's that that
[16:15] these
[16:16] disciples that were walking on the road
[16:19] to Emmas had firthand news details
[16:24] details of what happened at the grave
[16:27] details of what happened at the cross so
[16:30] you see what's written in holy script
[16:32] when you read your scripture you might
[16:35] see that at the last supper
[16:37] there was uh uh the uh all the disciples
[16:40] standing there. You see that there that
[16:43] Jesus did these certain things, but who
[16:45] was serving the meal? Where were the
[16:48] sisters? They're not mentioned. They
[16:50] weren't mentioned. You sisters have a
[16:52] big part to play in the economy of God.
[16:55] You say, "Well, what where were all the
[16:57] sisters?" Well, who cooked the food? You
[17:00] know, it doesn't say Peter went out
[17:01] there and was put on his apron and
[17:03] started cooking the food. It doesn't say
[17:05] the disciples are doing that. The the
[17:07] the the sisters were doing that. It
[17:10] didn't mention them, but they were
[17:11] serving the food probably there. And you
[17:14] can start to see that, hey, it doesn't
[17:16] even me mention who who was behind the
[17:18] scenes, but there were people behind the
[17:21] scenes that scripture doesn't tell you
[17:23] about. It doesn't tell you about
[17:25] Cleopus. Nowhere except on that road to
[17:28] Emmas, but it doesn't tell you that he
[17:30] was there at the at the last supper. But
[17:32] he had firsthand news cuz he would they
[17:35] were telling Jesus sisters were early at
[17:38] the sbooker. They saw the angels. They
[17:41] saw the vision. They saw these things.
[17:43] They were telling the details to Jesus
[17:46] of what was came to pass right there at
[17:48] the gravesite. They told how Peter and
[17:51] John ran all the way to the grave and
[17:54] and and and and they looked in and they
[17:56] said, "Well, they didn't see him." So
[17:57] they came back saying, "Well, him they
[17:59] didn't see." So there details that are
[18:02] spoken about on the road team. You start
[18:05] to see that there are people behind the
[18:07] scenes that aren't written about but
[18:10] were right there present and and in the
[18:13] in the picture. They were in the
[18:15] picture. They were they were part of the
[18:16] of God's economy. And you got to realize
[18:19] that as we stand here as believers, we
[18:22] are part of God's economy. We may not be
[18:26] they may we may not be put my name my
[18:28] words things I say may not be ever be in
[18:31] holy script but we're part of God's
[18:34] economy because we're part of the bride
[18:36] of Christ and the scripture does talk
[18:38] about us because it says the bride has
[18:41] made herself ready and we'll come to
[18:43] that place one day when we when we make
[18:46] ourselves ready and the Lord comes for
[18:47] us we will fulfill a part of scripture.
[18:51] Amen. And as we stand here as a as
[18:54] message believers, you start to realize
[18:57] that that you've got a part to play in
[19:00] the scripture for a faith that was once
[19:04] delivered to the saints has to come to
[19:08] fruition.
[19:09] The the ones that stand for the faith
[19:11] that was once delivered to the saints,
[19:14] how can we write a book of acts? How can
[19:16] we write a book of acts after our life?
[19:19] How can how can how when they when they
[19:22] write about Lula Georgia, when they
[19:23] write about brother uh uhh about brother
[19:26] Wade, when they write about brother
[19:27] Dale, when they write these things down,
[19:30] they're going to be able to say, "Hey,
[19:32] they produced the book of Acts behind
[19:35] their lives. I saw cancers healed. I saw
[19:39] healing. I saw I saw the power of God
[19:42] move and raise up. I saw the power of
[19:45] God make that man a young man again. I
[19:48] saw this going on. I saw that going on.
[19:50] Why? Because they're the ones that take
[19:53] the word of God for their hour.
[19:56] Amen. These people stood there and they
[19:59] were in living out the very words that
[20:03] were going to be written in holy
[20:04] scripture. I was talking to the wife the
[20:06] other day and I said, "I, you know, I I
[20:08] I read the book of James and I I don't
[20:11] like James." He said, "Why don't you
[20:14] like James?" I said, 'Well, James James
[20:17] turned in Paul. He told him to go to the
[20:20] temple and and and and and give his and
[20:22] and and and he ended up getting getting
[20:25] thrown in prison from there. And from
[20:27] there, he lived his whole life in
[20:29] jail. And she said, "Well, that was must
[20:32] have been the the will of God." Amen.
[20:34] And I says, "Yeah, but you know,
[20:37] somehow, you know, it's just like uh
[20:40] like uh uh" And then I says, "Well, you
[20:43] know, she's right because Paul wrote
[20:47] almost all the New Testament from jail.
[20:51] He was on death row and he was writing
[20:54] everything that God wanted in holy
[20:57] script for us to have faith in." Amen.
[21:00] Amen. How can we come to the faith that
[21:02] was once delivered to the saints if our
[21:04] life doesn't live this gospel?
[21:10] Excuse me. Uh so so what what are we
[21:13] what what are we living for?
[21:17] As we live the the the as we live this
[21:21] this truth that's been presented in our
[21:23] day. What what is the is a believer's
[21:26] life about? where where can we write
[21:29] what what's going to be written of of us
[21:32] one
[21:33] day they had firsthand news they could
[21:37] they they they they when Jesus said oh
[21:40] fools slow of heart to believe what the
[21:43] prophet said
[21:45] and beginning at Moses the main
[21:49] prophet he came back expounding to them
[21:53] exactly so so you can imagine
[21:58] If you were standing
[22:01] there listening to Jesus tell you all
[22:05] that Moses had said about him,
[22:08] you know, I mean, uh, Moses, you know,
[22:13] uh, one of the main ones is Jesus. Moses
[22:17] said, "There will be a man, a prophet
[22:20] likened unto me." Amen.
[22:22] And whoever doesn't believe in this
[22:24] prophet and this in this one, he says,
[22:27] will be cut off from the people.
[22:30] So what would happen to us if we if we
[22:34] took the way of the scribes and
[22:36] Pharisees of the of the religious of
[22:39] that day? That's the biggest mistake
[22:41] they made. They were saying, "I can see
[22:44] a God of bygon
[22:46] ears. I can see a God of 2,000 years
[22:49] ago. I can read a Bible about 2,000
[22:52] years ago, but I can't believe that
[22:55] anything's happening in the 20th
[22:57] century. I can't believe anything's
[23:00] happening around us and to us and with
[23:03] us.
[23:06] And I see a lot of message believers
[23:09] that are looking back to brother
[23:12] Brandham's life. They're looking back to
[23:14] the years he was here in Georgia.
[23:16] They're looking back to the sermons he
[23:18] preached in in in Jeffersonville or in
[23:21] in in in in uh Shreport, Louisiana and
[23:24] all these places. They look back to
[23:26] these things and they say, "I saw God
[23:28] moving in brother Brandon's ministry.
[23:34] But what about moving in your ministry?
[23:38] In your life, in your in in in your day
[23:41] where you live." Amen. If God can heal
[23:45] cancer back then, brother, if God can
[23:47] heal cancer in a in a in a in a in a
[23:52] uh in a uh should I say in a in a in a
[23:56] meeting where Brother Brandham is in the
[23:57] Holy Spirit's movie, he said, "I can if
[24:00] you could see what I'm seeing." He says,
[24:01] "I see God moving all over the place and
[24:05] people could believe that and come and
[24:07] reach out and grab their reach out and
[24:10] touch the Lord." They could reach out
[24:11] and touch the Lord.
[24:13] So if they could do that there,
[24:16] they could do it today.
[24:19] They, you know, I I I may not be have
[24:21] the ability to see the cloud uh that he
[24:24] was looking at. I may not be able to see
[24:27] the the pillar of fire that he was
[24:29] looking at, but I know he's here because
[24:32] the Bible says wherever two or three are
[24:34] gathered in his name, there he'll be in
[24:37] the midst of him. Amen. So we can stand
[24:39] and say, "Look, we know that the same
[24:42] God that was in Brother Brown's meetings
[24:44] is here today here to do the same kind
[24:47] of
[24:50] things that were there." So we're
[24:52] looking at a at a at at we we we can't
[24:56] look at the scripture as something by
[24:59] God or something of 2,000 years ago. We
[25:01] can look at it as a a reality that we
[25:03] can live for today. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[25:07] So, what
[25:09] happened? Okay, so let me see where I'm
[25:12] at here. Okay, so we look at at at at at
[25:17] at at them and and they the there's
[25:19] where Jesus says with beginning with
[25:22] Moses and the prophets. He expounded to
[25:25] them all the scriptures concerning
[25:28] himself. Wouldn't you have liked to have
[25:31] been there hearing modern events made
[25:35] clear by prophecy? Amen. You start to
[25:38] see that, hey, it may have been six
[25:40] miles. And if you're walking a mile an
[25:42] hour uh listening to Jesus talk, it
[25:46] might have taken you uh two maybe
[25:49] two. If you're walking a mile an hour,
[25:51] you're making it'd be a six-hour
[25:54] sermon. They listened to a six-hour
[25:56] sermon. might have gotten what would
[25:58] have went by quickly as he expressed the
[26:01] very things that God was
[26:03] revealing revealing to them of all the
[26:07] Old Testament scriptures referring to
[26:10] himself.
[26:12] Now, if we could do that today, we'd say
[26:15] all the scriptures that brings us into
[26:19] the picture. Yeah. You say, "How how do
[26:22] you bring me me into this picture of of
[26:25] of of being a fulfillment of prophecy?"
[26:28] So, as you look at the ages we're living
[26:30] in and you look at the things that Paul
[26:33] said, he said, he explained that the
[26:36] Holy Spirit would lead you into all
[26:39] truth. And if the Holy Spirit's going to
[26:41] lead you into all truth, he's got to
[26:44] show you where he's working at in the
[26:46] very hour you're living. Amen. Yes. So,
[26:51] as the Holy Spirit is revealing the word
[26:54] of God for your day, you start to
[26:56] recognize, hey, I can grasp this. I can
[26:59] hold on to this. This is real. This is
[27:02] more real than my than my aches and
[27:04] pains. This is more real than my than my
[27:06] my feeling sick. This is more real than
[27:08] my I can say that this is I can I can
[27:11] say that that
[27:14] uh let's go to Hebrews 1 and 1.
[27:21] Amen.
[27:24] Hebrews 1:1. God who at sundried times
[27:28] and in diverse manners spake in times
[27:31] past unto us unto the fathers by the
[27:35] prophets, hath in these last days spoken
[27:39] unto us by his
[27:41] son, whom he hath appointed heir of all
[27:44] things.
[27:46] So when you have Jesus manifesting
[27:50] himself in your day and
[27:52] age, you start to realize, hey, he did
[27:56] speak through the prophets in time past.
[27:59] but by speaking to us through his very
[28:03] true word that he's expressed and showed
[28:07] himself, vindicated himself and showed
[28:10] himself in our day and age. We can start
[28:12] looking at a a God that's not a bygone
[28:15] age. It's a God of present. It's the God
[28:18] of present time. And this God of present
[28:20] time is here in our midst to do what he
[28:24] promised to do through the scriptures.
[28:26] Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes. So when when we
[28:30] look at at at the at the the times,
[28:33] let's look at look at Luke
[28:34] 17:30. Now in this one, let me mention
[28:39] to you when Jesus said this in Luke
[28:44] 17:30, Jesus is speaking. We got this
[28:47] here right
[28:50] purple
[28:51] one. Luke 17:30.
[28:55] These are scriptures that are that we
[28:57] know are the
[28:58] the the reference to this this scripture
[29:01] is usually done because it says in the
[29:05] days of the son of man when the son of
[29:07] man is revealed. But let's look at
[29:10] this. Let's go up to the 28th verse.
[29:13] Likewise
[29:15] also likewise also as it was in the days
[29:20] of Lot. They did eat, they did drink,
[29:22] they bought, they sold, they they
[29:26] planted, they builded. But the same day
[29:29] that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained
[29:33] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[29:36] destroyed them all. Even thus shall it
[29:40] be in the days when the Son of Man is
[29:43] revealed. Amen. So, we stand in a day
[29:47] when we know with all that's going on in
[29:50] politics and all, we know how we have a
[29:53] very pushy president and they're saying
[29:56] this this guy might just bring on World
[29:58] War II. There's fire and brimstone
[30:01] hanging in the heavens ready to fall.
[30:05] Okay? And but notice Jesus was referring
[30:09] to a time in scripture as it was in the
[30:13] days of Sodom.
[30:14] So, if we're going to go back to the
[30:16] days of Lot, the days of Sodom, we know
[30:20] there was a coming judgment.
[30:22] But we think about the coming judgment,
[30:25] we're we're standing in that kind of
[30:27] thing today.
[30:28] But as we think of the coming
[30:31] judgment, we want to know where the son
[30:34] of man is revealed. So, if you go back
[30:37] to the scriptures about Lot, let's drop
[30:40] back there to uh Genesis. real quick. It
[30:46] would be in Genesis
[30:48] uh Genesis 8. Uh let's go to Genesis 7
[30:54] 19 is it?
[30:57] Yeah. Genesis 19 talks about Lot. And
[31:01] there and there came two angels unto
[31:05] Sodom at evening. And the Lot and Lot
[31:09] sat at the gate of Sodom. Okay.
[31:13] Why would Jesus refer anybody to look at
[31:17] a backsliden person?
[31:20] Why would he refer to anybody to, hey,
[31:23] go look at
[31:25] Lot? Why do I want to look at Lot? The
[31:28] Lot's not going to it's not going to
[31:29] help me much to to learn all about make
[31:33] believers or
[31:34] unbelievers doesn't help me at all.
[31:38] But he still brought you to the time.
[31:41] Look at Genesis. Look here. So you look
[31:44] at Genesis, look there, but then you
[31:46] drop back one chapter, which you should
[31:49] never just take the scripture for what's
[31:51] written. You should always look ahead
[31:52] and look behind be look beyond and see
[31:55] the essence of what's being conversated.
[31:57] Genesis 18 is Genesis 18 is referring to
[32:03] the son of man ministry because you look
[32:08] at it under the under the the the
[32:12] the in the plains of
[32:15] Morai. Those those angels came to speak
[32:19] to
[32:20] Abraham. And notice some of the things
[32:23] that that angel did.
[32:25] That angel called him by the name that
[32:28] he had given him just a few few a little
[32:32] while before. Abraham was named Abram,
[32:35] not Abraham. But yet he referred to him
[32:38] as Abraham. Sarah was named Sarai. But
[32:42] he turned around and called her Sarah.
[32:44] Amen. So he knew that he had already
[32:46] changed their names. Yeah. Second of
[32:49] all,
[32:51] and he's sitting he's telling her that
[32:53] telling him that I remember my promise.
[32:56] I'm Sarah's going to have a child in
[32:58] nine months. Sarah laughed in the tent.
[33:01] Left in her heart. In her heart. But
[33:04] then when she came back to tell him, I
[33:07] didn't laugh. I didn't laugh out loud.
[33:10] But God said God God said no but you did
[33:15] laugh in your heart. Okay. So what
[33:19] happens? Discernment.
[33:21] So the explanation of of of what you're
[33:24] seeing here in this in this whole story
[33:26] in Genesis
[33:30] 18 is God coming to visit the real
[33:35] believer.
[33:37] The father of the faith. Amen.
[33:40] Now, we're called out from different
[33:43] walks of
[33:45] life. All of us have come to this word
[33:48] of God that's come in our day and age.
[33:51] And this is actually the calling out. I
[33:55] mean, you've got to walk like Abraham.
[33:59] He's the father of the faith and we are
[34:01] a faithful people. Amen. So, we've come
[34:03] to the same same conclusion that he will
[34:07] visit with us cuz we're the faithful
[34:11] people. We're we're the sons and
[34:13] daughters of Abraham
[34:15] through the faith.
[34:17] Paul explained that. So, listen to, you
[34:20] know, when when you when you look at at
[34:21] at the children of Abraham, the the true
[34:24] seed of Abraham
[34:26] wasn't through Isaac. I mean, it wasn't
[34:29] through uh Hagar, but it was through
[34:31] Isaac. And Isaac was faithful. Okay? So,
[34:35] you start to recognize that the the the
[34:38] the movement of God is moving through
[34:42] the faithful. So, when Jesus was
[34:43] referring to the days of
[34:46] Sodom, he was referring to Genesis 18,
[34:50] the father of the faith. Amen. The
[34:54] father of the faith. But he wanted to
[34:56] bring you to a to an to something you
[34:58] should pay attention to. Amen. And
[35:00] through uh the message of this hour, we
[35:03] start to realize these things. You know,
[35:06] we start to realize that, hey, look,
[35:08] brother Brandham referred to the days of
[35:11] Sodom as really the day when that angel
[35:15] came to visit Abraham under the oak of
[35:18] oak. He called it an oak of Morai, but
[35:20] it's a plains of Morai, it says here.
[35:23] and he
[35:24] was standing under a tree. I didn't read
[35:26] that it wasn't. So what happens then
[35:30] when we look at the at the at the
[35:32] scripture when we look at what what's
[35:35] our our part to play here? Let's
[35:39] go over to uh
[35:46] uh
[35:48] Isaiah. Okay. So as Jesus was expounding
[35:51] upon the
[35:52] scripture in Isaiah
[35:55] 53
[36:08] 1-12 Jesus might have been on his way
[36:12] telling them you
[36:14] know notice notice what was Jesus's
[36:18] ministry. What was my what was my
[36:20] ministry on earth? He says, "Who hath
[36:23] believed our report and to whom is the
[36:26] arm of the Lord revealed?" He says, "For
[36:29] he he is for he shall grow up." Now,
[36:32] we're talking about Jesus. Now, he shall
[36:34] grow up before him as a tender plant and
[36:38] his he as as root out of dry ground. He
[36:43] hath no form nor clumbliness. And when
[36:48] we see when we shall see him, there is
[36:51] no beauty that we should desire him. He
[36:56] was bruised. Wait a minute. He was
[36:59] despised and rejected of men. A man of
[37:03] sorrows, acquainted with grief. He hid.
[37:08] We hid as it were our faces from him. He
[37:13] was despised, and we esteemed him not.
[37:18] Surely he hath borne our griefs, and
[37:23] uh what's that? Uh carried our sorrows.
[37:27] Yet we did esteem him, stricken, smitten
[37:32] of God,
[37:33] afflicted, but he was bruised, but he
[37:36] was wounded for our transgression. He
[37:39] was bruised for our iniquities. The
[37:42] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[37:45] and with his stripes we are healed.
[37:50] All
[37:51] we all we like sheep have gone astray.
[37:54] We have turned
[37:56] everyone to his own own way and the Lord
[38:01] hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[38:04] He was oppressed and he was afflicted
[38:08] yet he opened not his mouth. Did Jesus
[38:11] speak back to uh to them? He not opened
[38:14] not his mouth. He
[38:16] was brought as a
[38:19] lamb to the sheer
[38:22] sheerers and as a sheep before the
[38:26] [Music]
[38:28] sheerers to the slaughter. Okay. And as
[38:31] a sheep before the sheers is dumb. So he
[38:35] opened not his mouth. You know, that was
[38:37] one thing that happened to me as in
[38:39] Rosietta. I had a sheep that kept
[38:41] getting out and he was chasing the
[38:43] neighbor's cows because he was all
[38:45] alone. And sheep are a herd vehicle.
[38:47] They want to they want to stay together
[38:49] with something else, some other animal.
[38:51] So, they were chasing the neighbor's
[38:52] cow. The neighbor's cows were scar
[38:53] scared to death of him. So, he was
[38:55] running them all over the place and
[38:56] they're they're going to have calves.
[38:58] So, he didn't want them to, you know,
[39:00] lose their
[39:01] calves. So, he came to me and he says,
[39:03] "You go get your sheep out of my yard."
[39:06] So, here I am running running running
[39:08] after that sheep. I have a horse. Why
[39:11] didn't I go get the horse?
[39:13] But I was running after the sheep. And
[39:16] finally, a sheep got so so worn out that
[39:18] he'd lay down and I'd put the rope on
[39:20] him and bring him back to my fence. No
[39:22] sooner did I bring him back to my fence,
[39:23] look at the whole fence, make sure it's
[39:24] all patched up, he was out there with
[39:26] the cows again. Oh gosh. So, I ran and
[39:30] ran and ran after him.
[39:32] And uh you know you guys that uh that do
[39:35] uh track and stuff like that that
[39:38] running does pay off by the way because
[39:40] uh I was I was running like that and uh
[39:44] and I ran all that well big part of the
[39:47] summer I was running after that crazy
[39:48] sheep. Finally I says no I'm going to
[39:50] butcher him. So, I went to go butcher
[39:53] him. And the crazy
[39:56] thing, I'm sawing away at his neck with
[39:59] the
[40:00] knife, and he's quiet as can be. Not a
[40:04] little murmur, not a mumble, nothing.
[40:06] Just laying there letting me cut his
[40:08] throat. I says, boy, I tears started
[40:11] coming to my eyes because, you know, I
[40:13] saw the scripture says that he was a
[40:17] like a sheep before the shepherd, before
[40:19] the shears, open not his mouth. Amen.
[40:22] And I says, "Man, I'm not shearing him.
[40:24] I'm killing him." And he didn't make a
[40:27] noise. Amen. Just the gurgling of the
[40:30] blood coming out. That was it. I said,
[40:32] "My goodness." I said, "Lord." Yeah. Uh
[40:35] so,
[40:37] nevertheless, you start to see that the
[40:39] scripture comes out
[40:41] perfectly. After that, the neighbors
[40:44] came and invited me to a game of
[40:48] football. After running all that way,
[40:50] they invited me to a game of football.
[40:53] And I don't know what was wrong with
[40:54] those guys, but they were all moving in
[40:56] slow
[41:00] motion. I'd see them coming for my legs.
[41:03] I could jump right over
[41:07] them. But let me tell you though, the
[41:11] the the
[41:13] the scriptures written of him were so
[41:16] perfect. Amen. So perfect. There's no
[41:20] doubt that you can say, "Hey, these
[41:22] things are exact."
[41:25] The scripture doesn't make a mistake.
[41:27] Amen.
[41:28] Now for example
[41:30] uh when you when you
[41:33] when I was I was reading you know
[41:37] reading in the scripture where it says
[41:38] that uh you know uh that Jesus came down
[41:41] from Mount Transfiguration and the
[41:44] disciples came and said well didn't the
[41:46] scribes and Pharisees say that you were
[41:48] to come first that that Elijah was
[41:51] supposed to come first before your
[41:53] coming? And Jesus says yeah Elijah is
[41:56] supposed to come. Let me that's that's
[41:57] in where is that? That's in uh Matthew.
[42:01] Let me see. I got it here someplace.
[42:04] Mount Transfiguration. Matthew 17:19.
[42:08] Oh, I guess brother brother's not
[42:10] keeping up with
[42:13] me. Okay. Uh but he said um Matthew
[42:19] 17:11 17:9. So there at Mount
[42:23] Transfiguration, the Peter, James, and
[42:25] John comes down and said, "Didn't Elijah
[42:26] supposed to come first?" And the and and
[42:29] you'll notice in the scripture, he says
[42:32] Elijah is going to come first and
[42:34] restore all
[42:36] things. But he says they did to to do
[42:41] Let's go over there. I'll find it
[42:43] here. Matthew
[42:47] 17. Here it is.
[42:51] I use ribbons to mark my places.
[42:55] Okay. Elijah shall truly come first.
[42:58] This is Jesus speaking at verse 11.
[43:01] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[43:03] Elijah truly shall come first and
[43:06] restore all things. Well, remember John
[43:08] the Baptist did restore all things.
[43:11] Okay? So, John the Baptist didn't
[43:13] restore all things. So, and he says,
[43:17] "But I say unto you that Elijah is come
[43:20] already." Now, that's talking about John
[43:23] the Baptist. Okay? The John, so there's
[43:26] a John the Baptist that's going to
[43:28] restore. I mean, there's a Elijah that's
[43:30] going to restore all things. That's the
[43:33] scripture that Malachi 4 and 5 referred
[43:35] to. Five and six. Malachi 4 5 and six
[43:38] referred to. But I say unto you, Elijah
[43:42] is come already. and they they and they
[43:46] knew him
[43:47] not, but have done unto him whatsoever
[43:50] they
[43:52] listed. So likewise likewise shall the
[43:55] son of man suffer of them. So
[44:00] watch. So John the Baptist got beheaded
[44:04] and he said the son of man will likewise
[44:06] die. So he was going to go to the cross.
[44:08] Yes, we know that. And we know that John
[44:12] the Baptist is referred to as Malachi
[44:14] 3. So you start to look at how
[44:17] scriptures work out. When you start to
[44:19] do a little study on John the Baptist,
[44:22] you find out that when when John the
[44:25] Baptist was was was going to be born,
[44:28] the angel uh Gabriel came to Zachcharias
[44:33] and said unto him and said unto
[44:36] him, he's coming in the spirit and power
[44:39] of Elijah.
[44:41] Wow. He's coming in the spirit and power
[44:43] of Elijah. But he says, "And he's to
[44:48] restore." Oh, how did I it say? He's to
[44:51] restore the
[44:54] hearts. Restore.
[44:58] Okay, let's go over there. Uh, I think
[45:01] that's
[45:03] uh St. Luke
[45:09] 111. That's uh purple, too.
[45:20] St. Luke
[45:26] 1:11. Okay. And there appeared unto him
[45:30] an angel of the Lord standing in the
[45:33] right hand side of the altar of incense.
[45:35] And Zachchariah saw him and and he was
[45:38] troubled and fear fear fell upon him.
[45:42] But the angel said unto him, "Fear not,
[45:45] Zachcharias, for thy prayer has been
[45:48] heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[45:51] a son, and thou shalt call his name
[45:54] John, and thou shalt h shall have joy
[45:58] and
[45:59] gladness, and many shall rejoice at his
[46:03] birth. For he shall be great in the
[46:07] sight of our Lord, and shall drink
[46:09] neither wine nor strong drink, and he
[46:13] shall be filled with the Holy Ghost,
[46:16] even from his mother's womb. We look at
[46:18] Elizabeth and Mary's greeting to each
[46:21] other. She the baby bleeped for joy
[46:24] inside her womb. Receive the Holy Ghost.
[46:28] And many of the children of
[46:30] Israel shall shall shall he re shall he
[46:35] turn to the Lord their God. And he shall
[46:39] go before him in the spirit and power of
[46:43] Elijah. Now watch this
[46:46] phrase to turn the hearts of the fathers
[46:51] to the children. Where's that scripture
[46:53] at? Malachi. Malachi 45 and 6, but it's
[46:59] only half the scripture. See, that half
[47:02] the scripture is talking about John the
[47:04] Baptist. But the other half of the
[47:07] scriptur is talking about an Elijah to
[47:09] come. Amen. That will restore all things
[47:15] when the judgment is about to strike.
[47:18] You know, I was telling you about Sodom.
[47:22] You know, before that judgment strikes,
[47:24] there's going to be an Elijah to come at
[47:27] the end time. Amen. Before his second
[47:30] coming. Amen. So, we start to see that
[47:33] scripture doesn't make a mistake.
[47:35] There's no place the scripture makes a
[47:37] mistake. It lines up perfectly all the
[47:40] way through. as he talked to
[47:41] Zachchariah, as he talked in Mount
[47:44] Transfiguration, as it as the reference
[47:46] to John John the Baptist talked about
[47:49] himself saying, "I'm the fulfillment of
[47:53] uh uh what was it?
[47:55] Uh I'm the fulfillment of of
[48:01] uh Isaiah
[48:03] 40. Isaiah 40 3 and five." So you see
[48:08] he's he John the Baptist himself
[48:11] referred to exactly where did I have
[48:14] that right? Yes. Isaiah 40
[48:18] and3. See so so you start to see that
[48:23] that the the the details where God is
[48:26] trying to to to bring uh people to
[48:31] recognize where they're living and how
[48:34] they're living. the road to Emmus. You
[48:37] might say, "Well, that would have been
[48:38] wonderful to know the signs of the
[48:40] time." But when we stand here and start
[48:43] to look at modern events that are made
[48:46] clear by what God has revealed in his
[48:49] word, by what God has revealed through
[48:51] his messenger, by what God has revealed
[48:53] through his people, by what God is
[48:56] revealing through our ministers that
[48:58] have the five-fold ministry, it's going
[49:01] to bring you to a a realization of how
[49:04] close we are to his coming.
[49:07] Amen. Amen.
[49:10] And uh so so what are we looking at?
[49:12] Flashing red light of his coming. If you
[49:14] look at that, you start to recognize
[49:17] that certain things are going on.
[49:20] Population is getting too big. The world
[49:22] can't handle the population. They're
[49:24] saying we got to we're we're going to if
[49:27] we could continue on with a population
[49:29] explosion, we're going to stop being
[49:31] able to produce the food. especially
[49:34] with climate change. We're not going to
[49:36] be able to produce the food that all the
[49:38] population is going to need. uh the uh
[49:42] ungodly attitude that the people are
[49:44] coming into with the uh uh uh I guess
[49:47] with the internet and the and the and
[49:50] the the the the coming of a cell phone
[49:52] and all these things, you'll start to
[49:54] see that there's become such an ungodly
[49:56] attitude where you can start to see
[49:58] Satan's Eden is beginning to push into
[50:01] its push into everybody even trying to
[50:05] push into the church. So, you start to
[50:07] see that Satan's Eden's coming on. Sodom
[50:10] and Gomorrah, uh, homosexuality, you
[50:13] could see that that particular thing,
[50:15] they're it's running rampant. Abortion,
[50:19] people don't want to have children. And
[50:21] if they do have children, if they get
[50:22] pregnant, they're killing the children
[50:25] before they're born. Uh, so simple. The
[50:28] morning after pill, you can just take
[50:30] that and abort the baby. So, what are
[50:34] they doing? They're making it simple as
[50:36] just a pill to take. Amen. Politics. You
[50:39] know, you can see where politics is
[50:41] leading us. Our economy, you know, what
[50:44] I thought I was going to have a decent
[50:46] retirement with it laying in the stock
[50:49] market makes it look like where's my
[50:51] retirement? No retirement no more. So,
[50:53] what are we doing? We're going to have
[50:55] to work for the rest of our lives. I
[50:57] don't know. But I do know God's coming.
[50:59] The Lord's judgment is hanging over.
[51:01] World War II, Iran, Hamas, Israel, all
[51:06] uh Hezbala, the hopes, all these things
[51:09] are signs of the time telling you that,
[51:11] hey, we're coming close to the coming of
[51:13] the Lord.
[51:16] Looking for the faith that was once
[51:18] delivered to the saints. We look at
[51:23] look at Israel. Look, you know, Brother
[51:25] Bram always said that Israel was a time
[51:27] piece. If you look at the book of
[51:29] Daniel, it tells you it's a time piece.
[51:31] It gives you more or less where we're at
[51:35] living in today. Because you if you look
[51:37] at the book of Daniel, it goes to
[51:39] telling you from this time to this time
[51:41] when the Messiah was here. From this
[51:43] time to this time, the the the the
[51:47] uh the re the return to Jerusalem was
[51:50] there. It gives you time a a time
[51:53] pattern and you can look at that time
[51:55] pattern and say, "Hey, look, we're at
[51:57] the end of it." Amen. There's not the
[52:00] coming of the Lord and the and the and
[52:02] the and and the the
[52:05] the rise up of the of the Antichrist and
[52:09] all these things. They're on their way.
[52:12] They're on their way. So, what are we
[52:14] looking at? We look at the the the the
[52:16] the big pull for
[52:18] AI chat GPT. Wonderful. It speaks way
[52:22] better than Siri. It speaks way better
[52:24] than your your telephone questions. You
[52:26] ask the internet and it gives you but
[52:28] this one here can put together
[52:30] everything. It It seems great. AI seems
[52:33] great, but guess what? They're
[52:35] installing those things in robots.
[52:38] They're installing them on self-driving
[52:39] cars. They're installing installing them
[52:42] in the weapon. And the weapons will be
[52:44] able to to fly through the air and say,
[52:46] "Is this a friendly or a foe?" And it
[52:50] makes the decision. Not some man in the
[52:52] background saying, "Hey, I got my sights
[52:55] there. Is this a enemy tank or is it a
[52:58] friendly tank?" No, the AI's got to make
[53:01] that
[53:02] decision. You going to trust AI to do
[53:05] that?
[53:07] They say it's better than human. Hey,
[53:10] self-driving cars drive better than
[53:11] humans. Does it really? I don't know.
[53:14] I'm not ready to trust them. So, what
[53:17] are we looking
[53:20] at? Satellite satellite lasers. They're
[53:24] they're, you know, they call it the
[53:25] space force. They got to have control of
[53:27] space. They got to have control of
[53:29] satellite
[53:30] weaponry. Well, guess who's going to
[53:32] have, if you look at your scriptures,
[53:33] guess who's going to have control of
[53:35] satellite weaponry? The beast. He'll
[53:38] call fire down from heaven. Amen.
[53:41] You you look at you look at the things
[53:43] if you look at scriptures weaponry the
[53:46] the the weaponry space weapons and uh of
[53:50] course uh uh the
[53:55] uh electromagnetic weapons things that
[53:58] could just knock out complete power grid
[54:01] over the whole world you know the these
[54:04] things are really they're they're coming
[54:06] to reality now and you start to look at
[54:09] judgment sitt hidden upon the world and
[54:12] you said plagues and things like that
[54:15] could happen. Yeah. What do you think?
[54:16] Uh when they when they can they can make
[54:19] it in a laboratory, they can make it
[54:21] spread anywhere.
[54:24] So judgment is hanging over this
[54:27] world.
[54:29] But by knowing the
[54:31] events and the prophecies that are
[54:34] given, you start to recognize where
[54:37] you're living. Amen. And as you
[54:39] recognize where you're living, you you
[54:42] you get closer to God. You know, I' I've
[54:45] I've watched a lot of I I watch Israel
[54:48] News, and there's a couple of
[54:51] Christian Jews that are telling trying
[54:54] to tell you the the it's called TBN
[54:57] News. You say, "Well, that's all a slant
[54:59] from the Israel side." Yeah, but you
[55:02] know, it's strange to see
[55:04] Israelites that believe that Jesus was
[55:07] the Messiah. Amen. You know, and they're
[55:10] telling the news and I and and I I says,
[55:12] "Well, but you know what they're saying?
[55:14] They're saying, "Pray for us. Pray for
[55:16] Israel. Pray for for Jerusalem." He
[55:20] says, "We know we know that Christ is
[55:26] the Messiah and he's got his hand on
[55:30] Israel."
[55:31] So, we So, we start to look and I look
[55:34] at that I I look at it as a sign. Look
[55:36] at Israel. It's a sign of the time,
[55:39] you know, and you start to realize that
[55:41] they're saying we're fighting a
[55:42] spiritual battle. This is not altogether
[55:45] just guns and weapons and all this
[55:47] stuff. It's not just that. It's not just
[55:49] bombs and and stuff like that. It's it's
[55:52] it's a it's a spiritual battle that
[55:54] we're fighting. And we're fighting in
[55:56] the sight of good, they said. Amen. So,
[55:59] you start to see,
[56:01] look, the bride, when you look at at
[56:04] that where we're living, we look at the
[56:07] bride. The Bible says the bride has made
[56:09] herself ready. The coming of the Lord is
[56:11] at hand. He knows who you are. He knows
[56:15] what you're fighting for. He knows where
[56:17] you're where you're standing and what
[56:19] you're coming up against. But, you know,
[56:22] like you say, our fight is not against
[56:25] flesh and blood.
[56:27] And you know, even though at brother
[56:29] Brandham's day it was really strongly
[56:31] against denomination,
[56:33] it's not so much against denomination
[56:35] anymore.
[56:36] Our fights become against
[56:40] worldliness,
[56:42] selfishness. The selfishness that's
[56:44] taking over this planet and no, you
[56:48] know, it becomes that every little kid
[56:50] that's growing up is saying, "What's in
[56:53] it for me? What's I want it? I want
[56:57] everything. I want it. It's mine. It's
[56:59] mine. I don't want to share.
[57:01] Where is this coming
[57:03] from? You know,
[57:06] if I can't have it, Cain should I mean,
[57:09] Abel shouldn't have it.
[57:11] You know,
[57:14] you know, you you can say that, hey,
[57:17] look, you look at at Cain and Abel and
[57:20] you start to see that, hey, the attitude
[57:23] that the world is coming into, it's just
[57:27] plain simple
[57:30] worldliness. In
[57:32] uh St. John 15:19 it says, "If ye were
[57:37] if ye if
[57:39] ye were if ye were of the world, the
[57:43] world would love its
[57:45] own." Amen. St.
[57:49] John St. John 2:15, it
[57:53] says, I mean, 1 John
[57:59] 2:15, the Lord said,
[58:07] uh, if if a man loved the
[58:10] world, the love of the father or the
[58:14] love of God is not in him. And then St.
[58:18] John 15:19 it says, "If ye were of the
[58:21] world, the world would love you, love
[58:24] his own. But because ye are not of the
[58:28] world, but the but I I have
[58:33] chose but I have chosen you out of the
[58:37] world. Therefore, the world hateth you."
[58:42] Amen. So the world's the biggest
[58:45] pressure against this bride. Amen.
[58:49] Against the really it's against our
[58:52] youth. A lot of people are lo losing
[58:54] their youth just to the world.
[58:57] And the reason they're losing their
[58:59] youth to the world is because you know
[59:01] sometimes we're not giving them the best
[59:03] example.
[59:05] The best example is living by faith.
[59:08] Amen. Amen. Let's let's stand to our
[59:11] feet as we get ready to
[59:13] close. Amen. Take a look at what's
[59:17] happened in the last few
[59:19] years. It's no longer I mean I would be
[59:23] happy if my uh uh siblings and my and my
[59:27] would would at least become a good
[59:29] Baptist. I'd be happy there. I mean they
[59:32] could function. But the world's tearing
[59:35] them up.
[59:37] The lust of the world's tearing them up.
[59:39] Amen.
[59:40] Drugs, alcohol, world, the world's just
[59:44] they're losing their minds.
[59:47] And what and what what are they gaining?
[59:50] I'd be happy if they would just seek God
[59:52] and and and and just just just be a good
[59:55] denomination person
[59:58] or even just be functional.
[1:00:01] But they can't even function if they
[1:00:02] don't have Christ. And the whole world
[1:00:05] needs Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:08] Amen.
[1:00:10] But events made clear by prophecy, you
[1:00:13] start to
[1:00:14] recognize the day we live
[1:00:17] in without
[1:00:19] Jesus, we're all lost. Amen. Let's let's
[1:00:24] clo let's pray. Our dear and precious
[1:00:27] Lord and heavenly father, we're so
[1:00:28] grateful, Lord God, for your the
[1:00:31] manifestation of your kingdom coming,
[1:00:33] Lord God. And Lord Jesus, we pray, oh
[1:00:35] Lord, that you be merciful. Open our
[1:00:38] understanding to your holy word. Lord
[1:00:39] God, help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize
[1:00:43] all the things that you've done that are
[1:00:46] bringing us to a place where we can see
[1:00:48] the truth that's been manifested before
[1:00:51] us. That your ministry, Lord God, would
[1:00:54] help us to see the power of your
[1:00:57] resurrection, the manifestation of your
[1:01:00] glory coming in our midst, Lord God.
[1:01:04] Lord Jesus, we love you. We pray you
[1:01:06] bless each and every one, Lord God.
[1:01:08] Anoint each and everyone. Fill each and
[1:01:10] every one of us, Lord God. Help us,
[1:01:13] Lord, to serve you with all that's in us
[1:01:16] as we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:01:20] Brother, amen, brother
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:29] Wayne. Turn it off. Awesome in this
[1:01:34] place. I have a
[1:01:39] father. Enjoy the message. Then let's
[1:01:41] reap the benefits.
[1:01:44] Let's see what God has for us.
[1:01:48] You are awesome in this
[1:01:51] place, mighty God. Sing it to him.
[1:01:56] Oh, you are awesome in this
[1:02:00] place. Mighty
[1:02:04] God, you are awesome in this place. Aba
[1:02:13] Father, you are worthy of all
[1:02:17] praise. To you our life we
[1:02:21] raise. You are awesome in this place.
[1:02:26] mighty God.
[1:02:29] I often thought about those people,
[1:02:30] Cleopus and the ones.
[1:02:33] They walked with Jesus, but they didn't
[1:02:35] know who he was until right at the very
[1:02:37] end of their walk. Had you'd rather been
[1:02:40] them to see him personally, or you'd
[1:02:42] rather live today where we know who he
[1:02:45] is, we know where he's at, and we know
[1:02:47] the word of God was sent to us. We don't
[1:02:50] have to guess. Our heart should burn
[1:02:52] within us all the time. Not just on the
[1:02:55] journey going down a road for six miles.
[1:03:00] Mighty God. Sing it to him. You have a
[1:03:03] need. You are awesome in this
[1:03:08] place. Mighty God,
[1:03:11] what an awesome time to live in. And you
[1:03:13] are awesome in greater than even when
[1:03:15] Jesus was walking on the earth.
[1:03:18] This is the ending of all things.
[1:03:21] You are worth the last of our praise.
[1:03:24] And he saved the best for last. You are
[1:03:27] glory. We understand and our heart burns
[1:03:30] all the time to know more about
[1:03:32] him. Mighty God. Sing it to him one more
[1:03:35] time. Oh, you are awesome in this
[1:03:41] place. Mighty God.
[1:03:44] Thank you, Lord. You are awesome in this
[1:03:48] place.
[1:03:50] Ab
[1:03:53] father. You are worthy of all
[1:03:58] praise. To you our lives we
[1:04:01] raise. You are awesome in this
[1:04:05] place. Mighty God.
[1:04:10] Amen. Let's give our brother a good
[1:04:12] hand. Always love brother Daniel and
[1:04:15] sister Debbie coming to visit and we
[1:04:18] sure appreciate him.
[1:04:19] and uh they just don't stay long enough.
[1:04:22] But uh we sure appreciate them coming
[1:04:24] and uh and being with us. They didn't I
[1:04:26] didn't think I don't they just come to
[1:04:27] see us. I don't know that they come to
[1:04:29] see Rachel and and Timbo, but I know
[1:04:31] they come to see us. So we always love
[1:04:34] him coming here with us and speaking for
[1:04:36] us and pouring his heart out. And we
[1:04:39] sure, as I said before, I thought about
[1:04:41] that one time. You know, you you could
[1:04:43] they were standing with Jesus walking
[1:04:44] with the man, the man in a glorified
[1:04:47] body. All right, this is after the
[1:04:49] resurrection, right? He was in a
[1:04:50] glorified body. He was walking with them
[1:04:52] down the road. They didn't have a clue
[1:04:55] who he was and he started at Moses,
[1:04:59] something they were familiar with
[1:05:00] because it was not a New Testament at
[1:05:02] the time. They were familiar with the
[1:05:04] Old Testament, though they knew that
[1:05:06] Torah and he took him and just walked
[1:05:08] them right down and showed them who he
[1:05:10] was. And it still took him a while to
[1:05:15] see because he had then showed him a
[1:05:16] sign. He showed him a sign and when he
[1:05:19] showed him a sign of breaking the bread
[1:05:20] and got them in there where they were
[1:05:22] communing together, they they found out
[1:05:24] who he was. But what was what was so
[1:05:27] awesome is they let he he disappeared
[1:05:29] out from away from them. He's not going
[1:05:31] to disappear from me and you. He said,
[1:05:34] "I'll be with you even in you till the
[1:05:36] end of the age." So I'd rather be in
[1:05:38] this age. Amen. I'd rather have the Lord
[1:05:40] Jesus inside of me instead of having him
[1:05:41] walk beside me. It'd be wonderful. We're
[1:05:44] going to walk with him for an eternity.
[1:05:45] But now, what about right now? What
[1:05:47] about today? Today is the day of
[1:05:49] salvation. Today's the day he wanted he
[1:05:52] wanted that day, brother John. When he
[1:05:54] was hanging on a cross, we were on his
[1:05:57] mind. Amen. But now we're coming down to
[1:05:59] the last part of the names. Hallelujah.
[1:06:01] There's no more names of church ages.
[1:06:04] This is it. Amen. So, I'll promise you,
[1:06:06] he's going to call the last name. And
[1:06:08] when he does, we're getting out of here.
[1:06:12] We're going to leave this
[1:06:14] place.
[1:06:16] Sure. As brother Aaron saying at Dad's
[1:06:19] funeral, you know, some call it heaven.
[1:06:20] I call it home. This ain't home then.
[1:06:22] This is not home. We're going to a
[1:06:23] physical place in a few minutes that you
[1:06:25] call your house, but it's not your home.
[1:06:28] That's right. Your home is where Jesus
[1:06:30] is. Amen. And he's in your heart now,
[1:06:32] but you're going to get to live for an
[1:06:35] eternity.
[1:06:36] Praise God. You love the Lord. Uh this
[1:06:40] weekend, remember 11 o'clock at the
[1:06:42] park, uh it's where we went. It's where
[1:06:44] we always have our
[1:06:46] functions at starting at 11:00
[1:06:48] continuing through the day. And remember
[1:06:50] that Sunday now after we have our
[1:06:53] service here, have communion and
[1:06:54] footwashing,
[1:06:56] um Mike will be back with us at 4:00 at
[1:06:58] my house. For those of you that had not
[1:07:00] have not um practiced shooting, um
[1:07:04] you're sure welcome to come down and and
[1:07:06] we will um we'll continue that. But uh
[1:07:09] remember all these uh announcements
[1:07:11] coming up, special meetings and all.
[1:07:14] Also, we got someone that's going to be
[1:07:16] leaving us for a little while and she's
[1:07:18] going overseas. Sister Bella is going to
[1:07:20] take a take a trip. So, we're going to
[1:07:22] ask her to come up here and we're going
[1:07:23] to pray for traveling mercies for her.
[1:07:25] She's going to go through Europe
[1:07:28] and parts
[1:07:30] unknown. So, we're going to give you a
[1:07:32] prayer cloth and we're going to say a
[1:07:34] prayer for you, okay? I wouldn't want my
[1:07:38] kid going somewhere without a prayer
[1:07:39] cloth. I promise you that. Not even to
[1:07:42] the house, much less across the ocean.
[1:07:44] Let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly
[1:07:46] father, Lord, I pray that you'd bless
[1:07:48] our sister, Lord, that she'll take Jesus
[1:07:51] Christ wherever she goes, Lord, and
[1:07:53] presents it to the people. Father, I
[1:07:55] pray that Lord that she'll have a
[1:07:57] wonderful time. Nothing will harm her
[1:07:59] hurt, Lord. She won't get sick. And
[1:08:01] Lord, she'll have a wonderful time in
[1:08:02] you, Lord. And give her a safe trip
[1:08:04] back, Lord. Be with the parents, Father.
[1:08:06] I know that they're going off, too,
[1:08:08] Lord. We'll pray for them in a little
[1:08:09] while, but our sister's leaving
[1:08:11] Saturday. And we pray that you'd just be
[1:08:13] with her, Lord, and and take her in your
[1:08:16] hands. Yes. And all things will be well,
[1:08:18] Father. In the name of Jesus, we pray.
[1:08:21] Amen. We're going to miss you. Return.
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:28] But if you get an
[1:08:31] opportunity, just say a prayer for her
[1:08:34] while she's gone. Say a prayer for her.
[1:08:37] She's been in another country and I know
[1:08:38] she's used to traveling, but that's a
[1:08:41] bad cruel world out there and it's
[1:08:44] big. But we got a bigger God. Amen. We
[1:08:48] got a bigger God that can be with her
[1:08:49] where parents can't be. He'll be right
[1:08:51] there with her. He said he'd be right
[1:08:53] there in you till the end of the world.
[1:08:54] Amen. So, we just keep her in prayer
[1:08:56] until she gets back. How long you been
[1:08:58] gone? A
[1:08:59] week. Yeah. Okay. So, just pray for her
[1:09:02] and uh pray for the
[1:09:04] parents having a kid being gone. So,
[1:09:07] just pray for them. So, all minds clear.
[1:09:08] Let's bow our heads. Lord, thank you for
[1:09:11] the word we've heard today, Lord.
[1:09:14] Father, we know one thing's for sure
[1:09:16] that as our brother said, your word is
[1:09:19] absolutely just dovetales. Every time we
[1:09:21] read a scripture or bring a scripture to
[1:09:24] light, Father, it just dovetail with the
[1:09:26] rest of the Bible. That's because you
[1:09:28] wrote it and you're perfect. You can't
[1:09:30] write anything else. You can't make a
[1:09:32] mistake. And Lord, we put our confidence
[1:09:35] in that that that we'll hear from you
[1:09:37] through scripture, but it has to be
[1:09:39] spoken by human lips. So, thank you for
[1:09:41] bringing our brother with us today,
[1:09:42] Lord. and we love him. We appreciate his
[1:09:45] ministry, Lord, and we appreciate his
[1:09:46] wonderful spirit and his wife, Lord, and
[1:09:48] the family's always been dear to us. We
[1:09:50] pray that you'd be with them, Lord, as
[1:09:52] they travel back, I think, in a few more
[1:09:53] days. They're going back, Lord, to to uh
[1:09:56] New Mexico, Lord. I pray that you'd be
[1:09:58] with them, Lord. Cover them by your
[1:09:59] blood and give them safe journey, too,
[1:10:01] Father, as they come back, Lord, and
[1:10:03] visit, Lord, whenever they can. Father,
[1:10:05] I thank you for all these things you've
[1:10:07] gi Lord. Thank you for giving us a
[1:10:09] five-fold ministry, Lord, that that can
[1:10:11] grab your mind, Lord, and speak it.
[1:10:13] Father, I pray that you'd bless each
[1:10:14] one. Heal the sick. Be with the ones
[1:10:16] that are traveling, Lord, somewhere
[1:10:18] else, Father, and back. I pray that
[1:10:19] you'd be with them until we come back
[1:10:21] together, Lord, on Sunday. I pray that
[1:10:22] you'd bless each one. Give each one a
[1:10:24] special blessing, Lord, the rest of this
[1:10:26] week. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God
[1:10:28] bless you. See you Saturday.
